This analysis of the Canadian health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Life expectancy is high, but it plateaued 
between 2016 and 2017 due to the opioid crisis. Socioeconomic inequalities in 
health are significant, and the large and persistent gaps in health outcomes 
between Indigenous peoples and the rest of Canadians represent a major challenge 
facing the health system, and society more generally. Canada is a federation: 
the provinces and territories administer health coverage systems for their 
residents (‎referred to as "medicare")‎, while the federal government sets 
national standards, such as through the Canada Health Act, and is responsible 
for health coverage for specific subpopulations. Health care is predominantly 
publicly financed, with approximately 70% of health expenditures financed 
through the general tax revenues. Yet there are major gaps in medicare, such as 
prescription drugs outside hospital, long-term care, mental health care, dental 
and vision care, which explains the significant role of employer-based private 
health insurance and out-of-pocket payments. The supply of physicians and nurses 
is uneven across the country with chronic shortages in rural and remote areas. 
Recent reforms include a move towards consolidating health regions into more 
centralized governance structures at the provincial/ territorial level, and 
gradually moving towards Indigenous self-governance in health care. There has 
also been some momentum towards introducing a national programme of prescription 
drug coverage (‎Pharmacare)‎, though the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 may shift 
priorities towards addressing other major health system challenges such as the 
poor quality and regulatory oversight of the long-term care sector. Health 
system performance has improved in recent years as measured by in-hospital 
mortality rates, cancer survival and avoidable hospitalizations. Yet major 
challenges such as access to non-medicare services, wait times for specialist 
and elective surgical care, and fragmented and poorly coordinated care will 
continue to preoccupy governments in pursuit of improved health system 
performance.

The Belgian health system covers almost the entire population for a large range 
of services. The main source of financing is social contributions, proportional 
to income. The provision of care is based on the principles of independent 
medical practice, free choice of physician and care facility, and predominantly 
fee-for-service payment. The Belgian population enjoys good health and long life 
expectancy. This is partly due to the population's good access to many 
high-quality health services. However, some challenges remain in terms of 
appropriateness of pharmaceutical care (overuse of antibiotics and psychotropic 
drugs), reduced accessibility for mental health and dental care due to higher 
user charges, socioeconomic inequalities in health status and the need for 
further strengthening of prevention policies. The system must also continue to 
evolve to cope with an ageing population, an increase of chronic diseases and 
the development of new technologies. This Belgian HiT profile (2020) presents 
the evolution of the health system since 2014, including detailed information on 
new policies. The most important reforms concern the transfer of additional 
health competences from the Federal State to the Federated entities and the plan 
to redesign the landscape of hospital care. Policy-makers have also pursued the 
goals of further improving access to high-quality services, while maintaining 
the financial sustainability and efficiency of the system, resulting in the 
implementation of several measures promoting multidisciplinary and integrated 
care, the concentration of medical expertise, patient care trajectories, patient 
empowerment, evidence-based medicine, outcome-based care and the so-called one 
health approach. Cooperation with neighbouring countries on pricing and 
reimbursement policies to improve access to (very high price) innovative 
medicines are also underway. Looking ahead, because additional challenges will 
be highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis, a focus on the resilience of the system 
is expected.

Self-help in Individuals With Depressive Symptoms: Protocol for a Randomized 
Factorial Trial.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based self-help interventions for individuals with 
depressive symptoms, in which the main component is often a web-based self-help 
program, have been shown to be efficacious in many controlled trials. However, 
there are also trials on self-help programs showing no significant effect when 
delivered in routine care, and some studies report high dropout and low 
adherence rates. Research suggests that these findings do not emerge primarily 
due to the specific content of a self-help program. It seems more important how 
a program is embedded in the context of human and automated support before and 
during the use of a self-help program.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to better understand the effects of 4 supportive 
contextual factors on outcomes of and adherence to a web-based self-help program 
for depressive symptoms. In a factorial experiment, 2 of 4 supportive factors, 
for which there is evidence for their role on outcomes and adherence, are 
realized during the intervention-personal guidance and automated email 
reminders. The other 2 factors are realized before the intervention-a diagnostic 
interview and a preintervention module aimed at increasing the motivation to use 
the program with motivational interviewing techniques.
METHODS: The study is a full factorial randomized trial. Adults with mild to 
moderate depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score: 5-14) are 
recruited from the community through the internet and conventional media. All 
participants receive access to a web-based self-help program based on 
problem-solving therapy. They are randomized across 4 experimental factors, each 
reflecting the presence versus absence of a supportive factor (guidance, 
automated reminders, diagnostic interview, preintervention module) resulting in 
a 16-condition balanced factorial design. The primary outcome is depressive 
symptoms at 10 weeks post assessment. Secondary outcomes include adherence to 
the program, anxiety, stress, health-related quality of life, possible negative 
effects, and treatment satisfaction. Potential moderators and mediators (eg, 
treatment expectancy, problem-solving skills, working alliance with the study 
team) will also be investigated.
RESULTS: Ethical approval was received on January 20, 2020. The study was 
initiated in February 2020, and 240 participants have been enrolled in the study 
as of November 1, 2020. Recruitment for a total of 255 participants is ongoing. 
Data collection is expected to be completed by May 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of relevant supportive factors in the 
dissemination of web-based interventions is necessary to improve outcomes of and 
adherence to web-based self-help programs. This study may inform health care 
systems and guide decisions to optimize the implementation context of web-based 
self-help programs for depressive symptoms.

The Contributions of Hypertension Diagnosis and Blood Pressure Control to 
Subjective Life Expectancy in a Representative Sample of Older U.S. Adults.

OBJECTIVES: High blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, a major risk factor for 
death and disease, is pervasive among older adults. While reducing BP to 
targeted levels can prevent adverse outcomes, rates of successful BP control 
remain suboptimal, and it is unclear whether older adults recognize its proven 
benefits. The current study sheds light on older adults' beliefs about the 
consequences of hypertension and benefits of BP control by examining how their 
self-reports of hypertension diagnosis and BP control, as well as measured BP, 
contribute to subjective life expectancy (SLE), their perceived probability of 
surviving to a target age.
METHODS: In a representative sample of U.S. adults aged 50-89 from the 2006-2014 
Health and Retirement Study (n = 18,979 respondents), we analyze SLE using 
generalized linear regression.
RESULTS: Diagnosed hypertension is associated with lower SLE, regardless of 
measured BP. Among diagnosed hypertensives, those who self-report controlled BP 
expect to live longer than those who do not. Finally, about 1 in 10 older adults 
have high measured BP but have never been diagnosed with hypertension, and most 
diagnosed hypertensives with uncontrolled measured BP self-report their BP as 
controlled.
DISCUSSION: Older adults appear to recognize the harmful effects of hypertension 
and the benefits of BP control, but often lack knowledge of their own 
hypertension and BP control statuses. Health communications should continue to 
stress the value of BP control, although improvements may require increased 
hypertension awareness and BP monitoring.

BackgroundThe role of clinical pharmacists in the provision of patient care is 
evolving in developing countries such as India. However, their acceptance in 
health care setups remains debatable. Objective This study aims to investigate 
the change in quality adjusted life-years after providing clinical pharmacist 
services in head and neck cancer patients. Setting Oncology speciality private 
centre in West India. Method It was a prospective, multi-centered pre-post 
study. Patients were recruited into the control group and intervention group. 
Clinical pharmacist services were provided only to the intervention group. The 
quality adjusted life-years was measured by incorporating the EQ-5D-5L 
instrument. Patients have been provided with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire at the 
pre-determined intervals i.e. before beginning of each chemotherapy cycles till 
the completion of treatment. The analysis was carried out using descriptive 
analysis and student's t-test. Main outcome measures Change in quality adjusted 
life-years amongst control and intervention groups of head and neck patients. 
Results A total of 104 patients were recruited, out of which 50 patients were in 
control group and 54 patients in intervention group. Docetaxel, cisplatin, 
5-fluorouracul regimen, paclitaxel-carboplatin regimen and weekly cisplatin were 
prescribed in majority of the head and neck patients (control group: 82%; 
intervention group: 74.1%). The majority of patients in the control group were 
facing medication-related problems such as irrational administration of 
chemotherapy (18.9%), lack of optimal supportive care (18.9), negligence of 
co-morbid conditions (16.1%), improper chemo-drug calculation (14.9%) and drug 
interaction (13.2%). The remedial action was provided by clinical pharmacist to 
overcome these medication-related problems in intervention group. The quality 
adjusted life-years significantly decreased in the control group from 0.012 to 
0.005, however, it remained constant in the intervention group from 0.013 to 
0.014 after the completion of 6 chemotherapy cycles. Conclusion The 
incorporation of clinical pharmacist services has helped us in identifying and 
understanding the various types of medication-related problems and their 
potential causes in patients suffering from head and neck cancer. Moreover, it 
helped to improve the quality adjusted life-years and decrease adverse drug 
reactions, reflecting positive impact on patient care.

PURPOSE: To estimate the life expectancy (LE) of HIV-infected patients in the 
West African country Guinea-Bissau and compare it with the background 
population.
METHODS: Using data from the largest HIV outpatient clinic at the Hospital 
Nacional Simão Mendes in the capital Bissau, a retrospective observational 
cohort study was performed. The study included patients attending the clinic 
between June 2005 and January 2018. A total of 8958 HIV-infected patients were 
included. In the analysis of the background population, a total of 109,191 
people were included. LE incorporating loss to follow-up (LTFU) was estimated 
via Kaplan-Meier estimators using observational data on adult HIV-infected 
patients and background population.
RESULTS: The LE of 20-year-old HIV-infected patients was 9.8 years (95% CI 
8.3-11.5), corresponding to 22.3% (95% CI 18.5-26.7%) of the LE of the 
background population. (LE for 20-year-olds in the background population was 
44.0 years [95% CI 43.0-44.9].) Patients diagnosed with CD4 cell counts below 
200 cells/µL had a LE of 5.7 years (95% CI 3.6-8.2). No increase in LE with 
later calendar period of diagnosis was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: LE was shown to be markedly lower among HIV-infected patients 
compared with the background population. While other settings have shown marked 
improvements in prognosis of HIV-infected patients in recent years, no 
improvement in Bissau was observed over time (9.8 years (95% CI 7.6-12.2) and 
9.9 years (95% CI 7.6-12.1) for the periods 2005-2010 and 2014-2016, 
respectively).

OBJECTIVES: To compare health-economic aspects of multiple imaging modalities 
used to monitor renal cysts, the present study evaluates costs and outcomes of 
patients with Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts detected and followed-up by either 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), contrast-enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging (ceMRI), or contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A simulation using Markov models was implemented and 
performed with 10 cycles of 1 year each. Proportionate cohorts were allocated to 
Markov models by a decision tree processing specific incidences of malignancy 
and levels of diagnostic performance. Costs of imaging and surgical treatment 
were investigated using internal data of a European university hospital. 
Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm results 
considering input value uncertainties. Patient outcomes were measured in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as averages per patient including 
costs of imaging and surgical treatment.
RESULTS: Compared to the 'gold standard' of ceCT, ceMRI was more effective but 
also more expensive, with a resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) >€70 000 (Euro) per QALY gained. CEUS was dominant compared to ceCT in 
both Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts in terms of QALYs and costs. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis confirmed these results in the majority of iterations.
CONCLUSION: Both ceMRI and CEUS can be used as alternatives to ceCT in the 
diagnosis and follow-up of intermediately complex cystic renal lesions without 
compromising effectiveness, while CEUS is clearly cost-effective. The economic 
results apply to a large university hospital and must be adapted for smaller 
hospitals.

An economic evaluation for the use of decompressive craniectomy in the treatment 
of refractory traumatic intracranial hypertension.

School, London, UK.

Objectives: The management of intracranial hypertension is a primary concern 
following traumatic brain injury. Data from recent randomized controlled trials 
have indicated that decompressive craniectomy results in some improved clinical 
outcomes compared to medical treatment for patients with refractory intracranial 
hypertension post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). This economic evaluation aims to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy as a last-tier 
intervention for refractory intracranial hypertension from the perspective of 
the National Health Service (NHS).Methods: A Markov model was used to present 
the results from an international, multicentre, parallel-group, superiority, 
randomized trial. A cost-utility analysis was then carried out over a 1-year 
time horizon, measuring benefits in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
costs in pound sterling.Results: The cost-utility analysis produced an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £96,155.67 per QALY. This means 
that for every additional QALY gained by treating patients with decompressive 
craniectomy, a cost of £96,155.67 is incurred to the NHS.Conclusions: The ICER 
calculated is above the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
threshold of £30,000 per QALY. This indicates that decompressive craniectomy is 
not a cost-effective first treatment option for refractory intracranial 
hypertension and maximum medical management is preferable initially.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia launched the Health Extension Program (HEP) in 2004, aimed 
at ensuring equitable community-level healthcare services through Health 
Extension Workers. Despite the program's being a flagship initiative, there is 
limited evidence on whether investment in the program represents good value for 
money. This study assessed the cost and cost-effectiveness of HEP interventions 
to inform policy decisions for resource allocation and priority setting in 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: Twenty-one health care interventions were selected under the hygiene 
and sanitation, family health services, and disease prevention and control 
sub-domains. The ingredient bottom-up and top-down costing method was employed. 
Cost and cost-effectiveness were assessed from the provider perspective. Health 
outcomes were measured using life years gained (LYG). Incremental cost per LYG 
in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Ethiopia 
(US$852.80) was used to ascertain the cost-effectiveness. All costs were 
collected in Ethiopian birr and converted to United States dollars (US$) using 
the average exchange rate for 2018 (US$1 = 27.67 birr). Both costs and health 
outcomes were discounted by 3%.
RESULT: The average unit cost of providing selected hygiene and sanitation, 
family health, and disease prevention and control services with the HEP was 
US$0.70, US$4.90, and US$7.40, respectively. The major cost driver was drugs and 
supplies, accounting for 53% and 68%, respectively, of the total cost. The 
average annual cost of delivering all the selected interventions was US$9,897. 
All interventions fall within 1 times GDP per capita per LYG, indicating that 
they are very cost-effective (ranges: US$22-$295 per LYG). Overall, the HEP is 
cost-effective by investing US$77.40 for every LYG.
CONCLUSION: The unit cost estimates of HEP interventions are crucial for 
priority-setting, resource mobilization, and program planning. This study found 
that the program is very cost-effective in delivering community health services.

aligns with the developmental theory of ageing.

Ageing evolves because the force of selection on traits declines with age but 
the proximate causes of ageing are incompletely understood. The 'disposable 
soma' theory of ageing (DST) upholds that competitive resource allocation 
between reproduction and somatic maintenance underpins the evolution of ageing 
and lifespan. In contrast, the developmental theory of ageing (DTA) suggests 
that organismal senescence is caused by suboptimal gene expression in adulthood. 
While the DST predicts the trade-off between reproduction and lifespan, the DTA 
predicts that age-specific optimization of gene expression can increase lifespan 
without reproduction costs. Here we investigated the consequences for lifespan, 
reproduction, egg size and individual fitness of early-life, adulthood and 
post-reproductive onset of RNAi knockdown of five 'longevity' genes involved in 
key biological processes in Caenorhabditis elegans. Downregulation of these 
genes in adulthood and/or during post-reproductive period increases lifespan, 
while we found limited evidence for a link between impaired reproduction and 
extended lifespan. Our findings demonstrate that suboptimal gene expression in 
adulthood often contributes to reduced lifespan directly rather than through 
competitive resource allocation between reproduction and somatic maintenance. 
Therefore, age-specific optimization of gene expression in evolutionarily 
conserved signalling pathways that regulate organismal life histories can 
increase lifespan without fitness costs.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the management and 
outcomes of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Improved disease control 
and prolonged life expectancy now mandate focus on improving TKIs' safety 
profile. Recently, vascular adverse events (VAEs) have emerged as a serious 
consequence of some of the newer TKIs. In this review, we describe the clinical 
spectrum of TKI-associated VAE, and examine the unique vascular safety profile 
of the main TKIs currently used in the treatment of CML: imatinib, nilotinib, 
dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. The issue of TKI-related platelet 
dysfunction is discussed as well. We describe the contemporary research findings 
regarding the possible pathogenesis of the VAE. Finally, the different aspects 
of TKI-associated VAE management are addressed, including prevention methods, 
monitoring strategies and treatment options.

The number of sources of anthropogenic magnetic and electromagnetic fields 
generated by various underwater facilities, industrial equipment, and 
transferring devices in aquatic environment is increasing. These have an effect 
on an array of fish life processes, but especially the early developmental 
stages. The magnitude of these effects depends on field strength and time of 
exposure and is species-specific. We review studies on the effect of magnetic 
fields on the course of embryogenesis, with special reference to survival, the 
size of the embryos, embryonic motor function, changes in pigment cells, 
respiration hatching, and directional reactions. We also describe the effect of 
magnetic fields on sperm motility and egg activation. Magnetic fields can exert 
positive effects, as in the case of the considerable extension of sperm 
capability of activation, or have a negative influence in the form of a 
disturbance in heart rate or developmental instability in inner ear organs.

The application of direct force to a protein enables to probe wide regions of 
its energy surface through conformational transitions as unfolding, extending, 
recoiling, collapsing, and refolding. While unfolding under force typically 
displayed a two-state behavior, refolding under force, from highly extended 
unfolded states, displayed a more complex behavior. The first recording of 
protein refolding at a force quench step displayed an initial rapid elastic 
recoil, followed by a plateau phase at some extension, concluding with a 
collapse to a final state, at which refolding occurred. These findings stirred a 
lively discussion, which led to further experimental and theoretical 
investigation of this behavior. It was demonstrated that the polymeric chain of 
the unfolded protein is required to fully collapse to a globular conformation 
for the maturation of native structure. This behavior was modeled using 
one-dimensional free energy landscape over the end-to-end length reaction 
coordinate, the collective measured variable. However, at low forces, 
conformational space is not well captured by such models, and using 
two-dimensional energy surfaces provides further insight into the dynamics of 
this process. This work reviews the main concepts of protein refolding under 
constant force, which is essential for understanding how mechanotransducing 
proteins operate in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Radial nerve injuries cause profound disability, and a variety of 
reconstruction options exist. This study aimed to compare outcomes of tendon 
transfers versus nerve transfers for the management of isolated radial nerve 
injuries.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 30 patients with isolated radial nerve 
injuries treated with tendon transfers and 16 patients managed with nerve 
transfers was performed. Fifteen of the 16 patients treated with nerve transfer 
had concomitant pronator teres to extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon transfer 
for wrist extension. Preoperative and postoperative strength data, Disabilities 
of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores, and quality-of-life (QOL) scores 
were compared before and after surgery and compared between groups.
RESULTS: For the nerve transfer group, patients were significantly younger, time 
from injury to surgery was significantly shorter, and follow-up time was 
significantly longer. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in grip 
and pinch strength after surgery. Postoperative grip strength was significantly 
higher in the nerve transfer group. Postoperative pinch strength did not differ 
between groups. Similarly, both groups showed an improvement in DASH and QOL 
scores after surgery with no significant differences between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The nerve transfer group demonstrated greater grip strength, but 
both groups had improved pain, function, and satisfaction postoperatively. 
Patients who present early and can tolerate longer time to functional recovery 
would be optimal candidates for nerve transfers. Both tendon transfers and nerve 
transfers are good options for patients with radial nerve palsy.

BACKGROUND: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) for bony ankylosis is technically 
challenging in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). This study aimed to 
determine the mid-term results of bilateral synchronous THA for bony ankylosis 
in patients with AS.
METHODS: Nineteen cases of bony ankylosis in patients with AS who received 
bilateral synchronous THA were included in this study (17 males and 2 females, 
mean age 49.2 years). Disease duration was 5-38 years (mean 18 years and 
6 months). All patients received cementless THA. Intraoperative blood loss, 
visual analog scale (VAS) score, and complications were assessed. Harris hip 
scores evaluated the clinical effect.
RESULTS: Patients were followed up for 62-98 months (mean 82.5 months). VAS 
score decreased from 7.42 ± 0.92 to 2.42 ± 0.83, Harris hip score improved from 
21.8 ± 7.2 to 80.3 ± 6.5, and the flexion-extension range of the hip improved 
from 0 to 142.3 ± 6.2°. One patient with septum bronchiale had a fracture 
intraoperatively and was treated with wire strapping. One patient had a traction 
injury of the femoral nerve postoperatively and recovered 1 year after the 
operation. Loosening and subsidence were not observed in all patients. 
Heterotopic bone formation was noted in 3 patients. No complications such as 
joint dislocation, acute infection, and deep vein thrombosis were found.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral synchronous THA was effective for bony ankylosis of the 
hip in patients with AS because it improved patients' quality of life and had 
satisfactory mid-term outcomes.

Bone remodeling identifies the process of permanent bone change with new bone 
formation and old bone resorption. Understanding this process is essential in 
many applications, such as optimizing the treatment of diseases like 
osteoporosis, maintaining bone density in long-term periods of disuse, or 
assessing the long-term evolution of the bone surrounding prostheses after 
implantation. A particular case of study is the bone remodeling process after 
dental implantation. Despite the overall success of this type of implants, the 
increasing life expectancy in developed countries has boosted the demand for 
dental implants in patients with osteoporosis. Although several studies 
demonstrate a high success rate of dental implants in osteoporotic patients, it 
is also known that the healing time and the failure rate increase, necessitating 
the adoption of pharmacological measures to improve bone quality in those 
patients. However, the general efficacy of these antiresorptive drugs for 
osteoporotic patients is still controversial, requiring more experimental and 
clinical studies. In this work, we investigate the effect of different doses of 
several drugs, used nowadays in osteoporotic patients, on the evolution of bone 
density after dental implantation. With this aim, we use a 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) mathematical model that includes the 
effect of antiresorptive drugs on the RANK/RANK-L/OPG pathway, as well as the 
mechano-chemical coupling with external mechanical loads. This mechano-PK/PD 
model is then used to analyze the evolution of bone in normal and osteoporotic 
mandibles after dental implantation with different drug dosages. We show that 
using antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates or denosumab increases bone 
density and the associated mechanical properties, but at the same time, it also 
increases bone brittleness. We conclude that, despite the many limitations of 
these very complex models, the one presented here is capable of predicting 
qualitatively the evolution of some of the main biological and chemical 
variables associated with the process of bone remodeling in patients receiving 
drugs for osteoporosis, so it could be used to optimize dental implant design 
and coating for osteoporotic patients, as well as the drug dosage protocol for 
patient-specific treatments.

Brain metastases are the major cause of life-expectancy shortened for patients 
with lung cancer. The prognostic value of EGFR mutation subtypes and survival 
benefit of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with de novo brain metastasis is still not clear. 
Here, we present a real-world study nation-wide focusing on the prognostic value 
of genomic and therapeutic factors in overall survival (OS) of those patients. 
We enrolled a total of 233 patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and de novo BM 
from multi-medical centers across China. The enrolled patients were divided into 
4 groups, including EGFR 19del, EGFR L858R, EGFR wild-type, and EGFR unknown 
groups. The median OS of patients with EGFR mutations and all patients were 29.0 
and 25.0 months, respectively. There was significant difference in OS of 
patients among EGFR 19del (n=76), EGFR L858R (n=94), EGFR wild-type (n=46) and 
EGFR unknown (n=17) groups (30.5 vs 27.5 vs 16.0 vs 25.0, P=0.025). Patients 
treated by icotinib showed better OS than gefitinib and erlotinib (31.0 vs 25.5 
vs 26.5, P=0.02). There was a difference in OS of patients received the 
whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or WBRT+SRS 
(20.0 vs 31.0 vs 30.0 months, P<0.001), respectively. In multivariate analysis, 
patients treated with icotinib had superior iPFS benefit than gefitinib and 
erlotinib (HR=0.86[95%CI (0.74-1.0)], P=0.04). Besides, the histology of 
non-adenocarcinomas, the number of BM (>3), and extracranial metastases status 
could have an independent negative impact on the OS of all patients (P<0.001). 
EGFR mutant NSCLC patients with de novo BM had a better OS than patients with 
EGFR wild type. Patients treated with icotinib had longer iPFS than gefitinib 
and erlotinib but not in OS. Non-adenocarcinomas, number of BM (>3) and 
extracranial metastases were independent negative prognostic factors in iPFS and 
OS of all patients. Prospective clinical trials are warranted to explore more 
effective multimodality in this population.

BACKGROUND: Elderly population is rising due to advancement of health care, 
medical services, and increasing life expectancy. World Health Organization 
(WHO) has initiated a global project to define "age-friendly city for improving 
the elderly's quality of life".
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to determine the age-friendly cities 
characteristics from the elderly's point of view in Gorgan, Iran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 on elderly people who 
referred to the health centers of Gorgan, Iran. 160 eligible elderly people were 
recruited through multi-stage random sampling. The viewpoint of participants 
about the characteristics of Gorgan in the four age-friendly city indicators; 
urban and outdoor buildings, transport and transportation systems, information 
and communication services, and social support and health services was compared 
with the standard of WHO. Data were collected using the age-friendly city 
questionnaire and analyzed in SPSS-18 using Chi-square and one-sample t-tests.
RESULTS: From the elderly viewpoint, the mean score of 4 indicators; urban 
buildings and outdoor (58.50 ± 31.2), Transport and transportation system (43.3 
± 82.00), access to Information communication services (46.75 ± 15.1) and the 
level of access to social support and health services (81.43 ± 21.10). 
Considering age-friendly city indicators, the characteristics of Gorgan City 
were significantly lower than the WHO recommended standard (P < 0.001). The 
"Information and Communication" and "buildings and outdoor space" indicators had 
the highest and lowest differences from the standard, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to the present results it is recommended that managers and 
policymakers of urban planning and healthcare providers in their programs 
consider the elderly viewpoint to improve the urban characteristics as an 
age-friendly city.

BACKGROUND: Patient-oriented research approaches that reflect the needs and 
priorities of those most affected by health research outcomes improves 
translation of research findings into practice. Targeted therapies for cystic 
fibrosis (CF) are now a viable treatment option for some eligible individuals 
despite the heterogeneous patient-specific therapeutic response. This has 
necessitated development of a clinical tool that predicts treatment response for 
individual patients. Patient-derived mini-organs (organoids) have been at the 
forefront of this development. However, little is known about their 
acceptability in CF patients and members of the public.
METHODS: We used a cross-sectional observational design to conduct an online 
survey in people with CF, their carers and community comparisons. Acceptability 
was examined in five domains: 1) willingness to use organoids, 2) perceived 
advantages and disadvantages of organoids, 3) acceptable out-of-pocket costs, 4) 
turnaround time and 5) source of tissue.
RESULTS: In total, 188 participants completed the questionnaire, including 
adults with CF and parents of children with CF (90 (48%)), and adults without CF 
and parents of children without CF (98 (52%)). Use of organoids to guide 
treatment decisions in CF was acceptable to 86 (95%) CF participants and 98 
(100%) community participants. The most important advantage was that organoids 
may improve treatment selection, improving the patient's quality of life and 
life expectancy. The most important disadvantage was that the organoid 
recommended treatment might be unavailable or too expensive.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate acceptance of patient-derived organoids as 
a tool to predict treatment response by the majority of people surveyed. This 
may indicate successful future implementation into healthcare systems.

BACKGROUND: Although reduced port laparoscopic surgery (RPLS), defined as 
laparoscopic surgery performed with the minimum possible number of ports and/or 
small-sized ports, is less invasive than conventional laparoscopic surgery by 
reducing the number of surgical wounds, an extension of the incision is still 
needed for specimen extraction, which can undermine the merits of RPLS.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) 
in patients undergoing RPLS for colorectal cancer. The endpoints were 
perioperative outcome and oncologic safety at 3 years.
SETTING: Single-center experience (2013-2019).
PATIENTS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospectively collected patient 
records (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I-III sigmoid or upper 
rectal cancer (tumor diameter ≤ 5 cm) who underwent curative anterior resection 
via RPLS. We excluded patients who did not undergo intestinal anastomosis.
INTERVENTIONS: Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were compared between 
patients undergoing natural orifice (RPLS-NOSE) or conventional
