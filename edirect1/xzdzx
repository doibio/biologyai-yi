AIMS: Silicone elastomers, chemically known as polydimethylsiloxane used in 
maxillofacial rehabilitation, over a period of time, undergo degradation and 
discoloration once aged, thereby reducing clinical longevity. Many previous 
studies reinforced the maxillofacial silicone material with stronger materials 
to increase its mechanical properties. However, no studies have been conducted 
to evaluate all the primary properties using single reinforcing agent. This 
study was conducted to evaluate and compare the tensile strength, tear strength, 
color stability, and Shore A hardness of conventional and 1% 
trisnorbornenylisobutyl polyhedralsilsesquioxanes (POSS) modified room 
temperature vulcanizing (RTV) maxillofacial silicone after a 6 - month 
artificial aging period.
SETTING AND DESIGN: In vitro comparative study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight silicone samples were fabricated. Therefore 
for each parameter of tensile strength, tear strength, color stability and 
hardness, twenty two samples comprising of 11 samples of conventional RTV 
silicone (Group 1) and 11 for POSS modified RTV silicone (Group 2) were 
fabricated in stainless steel molds using ASTM D 412-06, ASTM D 624, and ASTM D 
2240-15 Standards. Baseline measurements for Shore A hardness and color values 
were recorded. Samples were then exposed to 6 months of natural weathering 
process and evaluated for tensile and tear strengths, color stability (ΔE), and 
hardness.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Paired and unpaired t-test.
RESULTS: Intragroup and intergroup comparison was done using unpaired and paired 
t-test. At the end of 6-month aging period, the tensile strength and tear 
strength of POSS-modified RTV silicone were significantly higher than 
conventional RTV silicone (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.00014, respectively). Intragroup 
comparison of conventional group showed highly statistically notable changes in 
L, a, and b values (P = 0.01631, > 0.0001, and = 0.0.0067, respectively), 
whereas the POSS-modified RTV silicone showed statistically nonsignificant 
results in L, a, and b values' (P = 0.91722, 0.15174, and 0.10847, respectively) 
comparisons after aging. Intergroup ΔE value comparisons showed an extremely 
statistically difference (P < 0.0001) within the groups. Intergroup comparisons 
postaging hardness showed a high statistical difference between both the groups, 
indicating a significant increase in hardness in the conventional group (P < 
0.0001). However, intragroup comparison for hardness values showed a 
statistically highly significant difference for Group 1 (P < 0.0001) and a 
nonsignificant difference (P = 0.4831) for Group 2.
CONCLUSION: After the simulated 6-month aging procedure, 1% NB 1070 
trisnorbornenylisobutyl POSS-incorporated RTV maxillofacial silicone showed 
better tensile strength, tear strength, Shore A hardness and color stability as 
compared to conventional RTV silicone. Hence, trisnorbornenylisobutyl POSS is a 
potent cross-linking agent which enhances the primary mechanical properties of 
RTV silicone can result in in significant increase in the mean life expectancy 
of RTV silicone even after 6 months of weathering.

The pleiotropic roles of eIF5A in cellular life and its therapeutic potential in 
cancer.

Protein synthesis is dysregulated in the majority of cancers and this process 
therefore provides a good therapeutic target. Many novel anti-cancer agents are 
directed to target the initiation stage of translation, however, translation 
elongation also holds great potential as a therapeutic target. The elongation 
factor eIF5A that assists the formation of peptidyl bonds during the elongation 
process is of considerable interest in this regard. Overexpression of eIF5A has 
been linked with the development of a variety of cancers and inhibitors of the 
molecule have been proposed for anti-cancer clinical applications. eIF5A is the 
only protein in the cell that contains the post-translational modification 
hypusine. Hypusination is a two-step enzymatic process catalysed by the 
Deoxyhypusine Synthase (DHPS) and Deoxyhypusine Hydroxylase (DOHH). In addition, 
eIF5A can be acetylated by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) which leads to 
translocation of the protein to the nucleus and its deactivation. In addition to 
the nucleus, eIF5A has been found in the mitochondria and the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) with eIF5A localisation related to function from regulation of 
mitochondrial activity and apoptosis to maintenance of ER integrity and control 
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Given the pleiotropic functions of eIF5A 
and by extension the hypusination enzymes, this system is being considered as a 
target for a range of cancers including multiple myeloma, B-Cell lymphoma, and 
neuroblastoma. In this review, we explore the role of eIF5A and discuss the 
therapeutic strategies that are currently developing both in the pre- and the 
clinical stage.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in muscle 
strength, muscle mass, balance function, and quality of life (QOL) among 
middle-aged breast cancer survivors (BCSs) and older BCSs.
METHODS: The study included 53 middle-aged (<65 years old) BCSs and 49 older 
(≥65 years old) BCSs. Muscle strength was evaluated via handgrip and knee 
extensor strength, and muscle mass was assessed using a body composition test. 
Balance function was assessed using the Timed Up and Go test and the body sway 
test. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short-Form Health 
Survey.
RESULTS: The older BCSs had significantly lower right grip strength, right knee 
extension strength, and muscle mass (P < .05) than the middle-aged BCSs. In 
addition, the body sway test showed that older BCSs had a significant increase 
in the length of center of pressure compared to middle-aged BCSs (P < .05). 
Older BCSs showed significantly lower physical functioning subscales in QOL 
compared to middle-aged BCSs (P < .05). The associations among muscle strength, 
muscle mass and QOL were more significantly observed in the older BCSs 
(P < .05). Furthermore, a significant correlation between QOL and balance 
function was observed in the older BCSs, but not in the middle-aged BCSs 
(P < .05).
CONCLUSION: There may be associations among muscle strength, muscle mass, 
balance and QOL in older BCSs, but not in middle-aged BCSs. We believe that the 
findings of this study will be relevant in the context of planning 
rehabilitation for older BCSs.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases, 
world data are lacking because most studies have focused on industrialized 
countries. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the global burden of gout and its 
associations with the year of diagnosis, age, geographical region, 
sociodemographic status and various further risk factors.
METHODS: Retrospective data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) were used, 
initially collected between 1990 and 2019. Raw numbers and age-standardized 
rates (per 100,000 persons) of prevalence, incidence and years lived with 
disability (YLDs) of gout were extracted from GBD 2019 for 204 countries and 
territories and stratified by sex, age, year, sociodemographic index and 
geographic region. Correlations between gout and other chronic diseases were 
identified, and the burden attributable to high body mass index (BMI) and kidney 
dysfunction was described.
RESULTS: The total number of patients and gout age-standardized prevalence rate 
increased between 1990 and 2019. Gout was most prevalent in Australasia and 
high-income North America, and a higher sociodemographic index (SDI) was 
associated with higher age-standardized prevalence, incidence and YLDs. High BMI 
and kidney dysfunction were risk factors for gout, while gout was correlated 
with other kidney diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The global prevalence of gout, as well as incidence, and YLDs 
increased worldwide from 1990 to 2019 and had a significant association with 
sex, age, geographic region, SDI and risk factors. Understanding the complex 
interplay of environmental, sociodemographic and geographic risk factors is 
essential in mitigating the ever-rising disease burden of gout.

Effective treatments for familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) offer patients the 
opportunity of normal life expectancy, but lifelong adherence to both 
lipid-lowering therapies and lifestyle measures is challenging, and thus, this 
is rarely achieved. The aim of this systematic review is to identify attributes 
of educational interventions that promote adherence to treatment in FH. A 
systematic literature search was undertaken using Medline, CINAHL, HMIC and 
Embase. Papers were included based upon pre-defined inclusion and exclusion 
criteria; the quality of each included paper was assessed using the MERSQI 
scoring system. Relevant data were extracted, and a narrative synthesis was 
created. Six relevant studies of varying methodological quality were found 
amongst 2963 papers identified during the search. In total, there were 619 
patients with FH in the intervention arm of the relevant studies. All six 
studies showed a positive effect of education on adherence to FH treatment; 
however, only two papers observed a statistically significant effect. Assessment 
was limited to the short-term. Four themes were identified as important when 
using education to improve treatment adherence: involving family, patient 
empowerment, practical problem solving and use of information leaflets. 
Educational interventions improve short term treatment adherence in patients 
with FH. Successful interventions are those that involve the whole family, set 
practical problem solving tasks, and that use techniques to increase the 
patients self-efficacy. This should all be supported by contemporaneous 
provision of written, age-appropriate information. There were no studies looking 
at education and long-term adherence in FH patients, and more research is needed 
in this area.

Elaborate behaviours are produced by tightly controlled flexor-extensor motor 
neuron activation patterns. Motor neurons are regulated by a network of 
interneurons within the spinal cord, but the computational processes involved in 
motor control are not fully understood. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor 
and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled 
muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal 
circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor 
interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, with previous studies 
reporting topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor 
premotor interneurons. To more precisely define how premotor interneurons 
contacting specific motor pools are organized, we used multiple complementary 
viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with 
each method. Contrary to expectations, we found that premotor interneurons 
contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly 
intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. 
Thus, premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor 
instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor 
circuit components.

Plain Language Summary: The spinal cord contains circuits of nerve cells that 
control how the body moves. Within these networks are interneurons that project 
to motor neurons, which innervate different types of muscle to contract: flexors 
(such as the biceps), which bend, or ‘flex’, the body’s joints, and extensors 
(such as the triceps), which lead to joint extension. These motor signals must 
be carefully coordinated to allow precise and stable control of the body’s 
movements. Previous studies suggest that where interneurons are placed in the 
spinal cord depends on whether they activate the motor neurons responsible for 
flexion or extension. To test if these findings were reproducible, Ronzano, 
Skarlatou, Barriga, Bannatyne, Bhumbra et al. studied interneurons which flex 
and extend the ankle joint in mice. In collaboration with several laboratories, 
the team used a combination of techniques to trace how interneurons and motor 
neurons were connected in the mouse spinal cord. This revealed that regardless 
of the method used or the laboratory in which the experiments were performed, 
the distribution of interneurons associated with flexion and extension 
overlapped one another. This finding contradicts previously published results 
and suggests that interneurons in the spinal cord are not segregated based on 
their outputs. Instead, they may be positioned based on the signals they 
receive, similar to motor neurons. Understanding where interneurons in the 
spinal cord are placed will provide new insights on how movement is controlled 
and how it is impacted by injuries and disease. In the future, this knowledge 
could benefit work on how neural circuits in the spinal cord are formed and how 
they can be regenerated.

BACKGROUND: Digital and mobile health interventions are increasingly being used 
to support healthy lifestyle change, including in certain high-risk populations 
such as those with severe mental illnesses (SMIs). Life expectancy in this 
population lags 15 years behind counterparts in the general population, 
primarily due to obesity-related health conditions.
OBJECTIVE: We tested the feasibility and usability of a 12-week interactive 
obesity treatment approach (iOTA) to adults with chronic SMIs (depression, 
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorder) receiving treatment in 
community settings. The iOTA incorporates short message service (SMS) text 
messages to supplement monthly in-person health coaching.
METHODS: Factors hypothesized to be associated with weight change were illness 
severity and treatment engagement. Severe psychiatric symptoms were defined as 
baseline Clinical Global Impression severity score of >5. Criterion engagement 
was defined as a text messaging response rate >80% during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment. Disordered eating, assessed with the Loss of Control Over Eating 
Scores, was also evaluated. Participants provided qualitative data, further 
informing assessment of intervention feasibility, usability, and acceptability.
RESULTS: A total of 26 participants were enrolled. The mean age was 48.5 (SD 
15.67) years; 40% (10/26) were Black and 60% (15/26) female. Participants with 
lower symptom severity and adequate engagement demonstrated significantly 
decreased weight (F1,16=22.54, P<.001). Conversely, high symptom severity and 
lower text message response rates were associated with trend-level increases in 
weight (F1,7=4.33, P=.08). Loss-of-control eating was not observed to impact 
treatment outcome. Participants voiced preference for combination of live health 
coaching and text messaging, expressing desire for personalized message content.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility of delivering an adapted 
iOTA to SMI patients receiving care in community settings and suggest testable 
criteria for defining sufficient treatment engagement and psychiatric symptom 
severity, two factors known to impact weight loss outcomes. These important 
findings suggest specific adaptations may be needed for optimal treatment 
outcomes in individuals with SMI.

BACKGROUND: Foodborne and zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis present many 
challenges to public health and economic welfare. Increasingly, researchers and 
public health institutes use disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to generate 
a comprehensive comparison of the population health impact of these conditions. 
DALYs calculations, however, entail a number of methodological choices and 
assumptions, with data gaps and uncertainties to accommodate. Thisreview 
identifies existing brucellosis burden of disease studies and analyzes their 
methodological choices, assumptions, and uncertainties. It supports the Global 
Burden of Animal Diseases programme in the development of a systematic 
methodology to describe the impact of animal diseases on society, including 
human health.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic search for brucellosis burden of 
disease calculations was conducted in pre-selected international and grey 
literature databases. Using a standardized reporting framework, we evaluated 
each estimate on a variety of key methodological assumptions necessary to 
compute a DALY. Fourteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (human 
brucellosis and quantification of DALYs). One study reported estimates at the 
global level, the rest were national or subnational assessments. Data regarding 
different methodological choices were extracted, including detailed assessments 
of the adopted disease models. Most studies retrieved brucellosis 
epidemiological data from administrative registries. Incidence data were often 
estimated on the basis of laboratory-confirmed tests. Not all studies included 
mortality estimates (Years of Life Lost) in their assessments due to lack of 
data or the assumption that brucellosis is not a fatal disease. Only two studies 
used a model with variable health states and corresponding disability weights. 
The rest used a simplified singular health state approach. Wide variation was 
seen in the duration chosen for brucellosis, ranging from 2 weeks to 4.5 years, 
irrespective of the whether a chronic state was included.
CONCLUSION: Available brucellosis burden of disease assessments vary widely in 
their methodology and assumptions. Further research is needed to better 
characterize the clinical course of brucellosis and to estimate case-fatality 
rates. Additionally, reporting of methodological choices should be improved to 
enhance transparency and comparability of estimates. These steps will increase 
the value of these estimates for policy makers.

BACKGROUND: In cases of intermittent claudication (IC) where traditionally 
noninvasive management yields unsatisfactory results, revascularization strategy 
in IC patients is generally decided based on anatomical considerations and the 
availability of a saphenous vein graft. Life expectancy should also be 
considered. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the 11-item 
modified frailty index (mFI-11) and the overall survival (OS) in patients with 
IC who underwent vascular bypass surgery to facilitate revascularization 
strategy selection.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of 144 consecutive patients (153 lower limbs) 
who underwent infrainguinal bypass for IC between 2011 and 2020. Patients were 
divided into 2 groups based on their mFI-11 score: high frailty (H), mFI score 
>0.3; and low frailty (L), mFI score ≤0.3. The OS was compared among the 2 
groups. Rates of graft patency and freedom from major adverse limb event 
(ffMALE) were also determined and compared.
RESULTS: Five-year OS in the L and H groups was 92% and 55% (P < 0.001). 
Multivariate analysis showed that mFI, age, and end-stage renal disease were 
independent predictors of OS. Five-year rates of primary and secondary patency 
and ffMALE for vein grafts were 81%, 91%, and 94%, respectively; those for 
prosthetic grafts were 65%, 80%, and 84%, respectively; the differences were not 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The mFI-11 was a helpful tool in predicting OS for patients with IC 
who underwent vascular bypass surgery. Those with H should not undergo open 
revascularization; however, for IC patients who have either not responded to a 
regimen of exercise and medication, or have specifically requested a more 
aggressive approach, obtaining a good score in frailty assessment is useful in 
determining whether or not bypass surgery would be a viable option.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic 
linked to metabolic disease and is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver 
disease. We, therefore, designed the study to analyze the global and regional 
burden of NAFLD from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We collected data on NAFLD from the Global Burden of Disease study 
2019, aiming to conduct a systematic assessment of the changes and trends in 
NAFLD in 204 countries. Secondary analysis of NAFLD was conducted using 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) to 
show the changing trends and development characteristics. Data statistics and 
visualization were executed with the R program.
RESULTS: Globally, incidence, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
of NAFLD all showed an upward trend. Between 1990 and 2019, the incidence of 
NAFLD increased by 95.4%, from 88,177 to 172,330 cases. Meanwhile, the ASIR of 
the middle SDI region had the highest increase, followed by the low-middle SDI 
region. Of all countries, the most incident cases were in China, which accounted 
for approximately 23.6% of NAFLD. China was also the country with the largest 
cases of deaths and DALYs. And behavioral risk, metabolic factors, smoking and 
high fasting plasma glucose were the critical risk factors associated with the 
mortality and DALYs of NAFLD.
CONCLUSION: NAFLD has become a considerable health burden in many countries. 
Therefore, we should control the risk factors of NAFLD and take corresponding 
measures to achieve its early prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND & AIM: Enteral feeding intolerance (EFI) as a result of 
gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in critically ill adults can lead to 
suboptimal nutritional delivery, increasing the risk of hospital acquired 
malnutrition. There are no validated measures of EFI or consensus as to which 
measures could be used to define EFI. The aim of this scoping review is to 
explore the validity of biomarkers, physiological or functional measures of GI 
dysfunction and EFI in critically ill adults characterising their use in routine 
clinical practice to identify those with GI dysfunction to better guide 
nutritional support.
METHODS: Database searches were completed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and 
Web of Science using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The search 
was performed until June 2022. Articles were included if they reported original 
studies that identify potential biomarkers or functional measures of EFI in 
critically ill adults. A nine-stage process was completed to extract and 
complete data synthesis.
RESULTS: 139 unique articles were identified. Following review of titles and 
abstracts, 114 of these articles were excluded, three further articles were 
excluded after full text review and 22 articles met the inclusion criteria. A 
thematic analysis of the articles included identified three overarching themes 
of GI dysfunction: (1) Serum biomarkers, (2) Physiological markers, and (3) 
Functional markers. Within the category of serum biomarkers, a further three 
sub-categories were identified: (i) enterohormones, (ii) markers of enterocyte 
function, and iii) cytokines and neurotransmitters. Some associations were seen 
between EFI and heparin binding protein, intra-abdominal pressure, 
cholecystokinin and acetylcholine levels but no markers are currently suitable 
for daily clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: Further larger studies are required to characterise the 
relationships between serum biomarkers, physiological and functional makers of 
GI dysfunction in critically ill adults. A robust definition of GI dysfunction 
should be included in any future research.

Hiring in-home paid caregivers (IPCs) to tend to older adults at home has been 
one of the popular long-term care strategies in several urban aging societies. 
Relevant studies in the Global South that provide empirical findings have been 
lacking. This study contributes to the literature on home care by conducting a 
qualitative analysis of work motivation and the quality of work life of female 
IPCs in Thailand. We found that work motivation involved the desire for personal 
economic improvement and the search for an emotional anchor. Analysis of quality 
of work life pointed to three major themes: great contribution but low 
recognition and support; interdependence as an ultimate career goal; and 
effective training as a key to opportunity and success. We proposed a 
theoretical extension to the existing care theories and suggested necessary 
policy interventions to sustain the supply of IPCs.

BACKGROUND: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common subtype of 
glaucoma. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk score (PRS) 
profiling as a screening tool for POAG.
METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing PRS screening in the UK and Australia, conducted from the 
healthcare payer's perspective. We used published data to calculate prevalence, 
transition probabilities, utility, cost and other parameters in the model. Our 
main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
secondary outcomes were years of blindness avoided and a 'Blindness ICER'. We 
did one-way as well as two-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The proposed screening programme for POAG in the UK is predicted to 
result in ICER of £24,783 (95% CI: £13,373-66,960) and would avoid 1 year of 
blindness at ICER of £10,095 (95% CI: £5513-27,656). In Australia, it is 
predicted to result in ICER of AU$34,252 (95% CI: AU$21,324-95,497) and would 
avoid 1 year of blindness at ICER of AU$13,359 (95% CI: AU$8143-37,448). Using 
the willingness to pay thresholds of $54,808 and £30,000, the proposed screening 
model is 79.2% likely to be cost-effective in Australia and is 60.2% likely to 
be cost-effective in the UK, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We describe and model the cost-efficacy of incorporating a polygenic 
risk score for POAG screening in Australia and the UK for the first time and 
results indicated this is a promising cost-effectiveness strategy.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of dependency is high among the elderly people 
worldwide and increases with increasing life expectancy. The purpose of this 
study was to establish from the perspective of resource demand the association 
between community environmental resources and dependency among the elderly 
people.
METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional design based on community from 22 
locations in China. A multistage sampling method was used to select the study 
objects. The questionnaires were used to collect the survey data by face-to-face 
interviews. A total of 950 individuals completed the survey, and 913 individuals 
were available for this analysis. Dependency and community environment were 
measured using the standard instruments. Logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify the community environment factors associated with 
dependency. Cluster analysis was used and demonstrated that dependency was 
mainly associated with community primary preventive care service resources.
RESULTS: In the group aged under 70 years, the utilization of electronic health 
records and the need for health assessments, and rehabilitation equipment 
rentals were significantly associated with the levels of dependency scores: the 
OR was 2.81, 2.25 and 2.13 (P < 0.05), respectively. In the group aged 70 years 
and over, a short-term care home was strongly associated with levels of 
dependency: the OR was 4.01 (P = 0.002). The daycare and nursing service, 
transportation service, and regular lectures on health knowledge were associated 
with levels of dependency: the OR was 2.41, 1.86 and 1.93 (P < 0.05). In the 
group with low social support, an emergency call or monitoring system, 
transportation services, the need for health assessment, and regular lectures on 
health knowledge were significantly associated with levels of dependency: the OR 
was 2.42, 2.19, 1.89 and 1.98 (P < 0.05), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Community environment resources were significantly associated with 
dependency. These results suggest that the dependent on local environment 
resources may consider as the resource needs among elderly people.

Healthy lifestyle levels are low among adults with hypertension (HTN). 
Unfortunately, psychosocial factors contributing to patients' inability to meet 
healthy lifestyle recommendations are not well-understood. This integrative 
review examined the relationships of three psychosocial factors (self-efficacy, 
outcome expectancy, and social support) with dietary adherence (DA) and physical 
activity (PA) among adults with HTN. In total, 24 peer-reviewed studies were 
assessed. Results showed self-efficacy had small-to-large relationships with PA 
(r = 0.02-0.46) and DA (r = 0.06-0.79), with the strength of the associations 
varying by the assessed domain and country of origin. However, few studies 
reported a small relationship between the remaining factors (outcome expectancy 
and social support) and PA and DA. Thus, more efforts are needed to delineate 
the contributions of social support and outcome expectancies on DA or PA. When 
designing an intervention that focuses on improving PA or DA among adults with 
HTN, these psychosocial factors should be targeted.

Early detection and treatment of osteoporosis can help to prevent debilitating 
fractures in the elderly. The osteoporosis self-assessment tool for Asians can 
be used as a screening tool to stratify patients for bone densitometry. It is 
most cost-effective for post-menopausal women aged 70 and males aged 75.
PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of selective bone densitometry 
(SBD) using the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) as a 
risk-stratifying tool for the three predominant races (Chinese, Malay and 
Indian) in Singapore.
METHODS: Decision analytical models were developed using a Markov model. Three 
scenarios were compared: no bone densitometry, SBD using the OSTA as a 
pre-screening tool and universal bone densitometry. Those diagnosed with 
osteoporosis were treated with five years of alendronate therapy. Data sources 
were from Singapore epidemiological studies, healthcare cost figures and 
published literature. Measurements include life years, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: Compared to no bone densitometry, SBD using the OSTA would cost between 
$40,679 and $73,909 per QALY gained for men aged 75-80 and $22,386 to $58,185 
per QALY gained for post-menopausal women aged 70-80. Universal bone 
densitometry would cost $157,955 to $177,127 per QALY gained for men aged 75-80 
and $40,179 to $66,112 per QALY gained for post-menopausal women aged 70 to 80 
compared to SBD.
CONCLUSION: In general, osteoporosis screening was the most cost-effective for 
Malays and the least cost-effective for Indians. However, a general guideline 
should still be applied to the Singaporean population, as further explained 
later. Overall, the most cost-effective strategy for males would be using OSTA 
as a risk-stratifying tool at age 75. For post-menopausal women, SBD should be 
used for women aged 70, while universal bone densitometry should be used for 
women aged 75-80.

We provide a unifying framework for the evaluation of population health. We 
formalize several axioms for social preferences over distributions of health. We 
show that a specific combination of those axioms characterizes a large class of 
population health evaluation functions combining concerns for quality of life, 
quantity of life and health shortfalls. We refer to the class as (unweighted) 
aggregations of health-adjusted life years (HALYs). Two focal (and somewhat 
polar) members of this family are the (unweighted) aggregations of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs). We also provide new characterization results for these focal members 
that enable us to scrutinize their normative foundations and shed new light on 
their similarities and differences.
