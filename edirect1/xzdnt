replace the CG model with the dynamics on the reduced subspace generated by a 
machine learning approach, the variational autoencoder (VAE). The molecular 
dynamic (MD) trajectories of the ribose-binding protein (RBP) in both the closed 
and open forms were used as the input by extracting the inter-residue distances 
as the structural features in order to train the VAE model, allowing the encoded 
latent layer to characterize the difference in the structural dynamics of the 
closed and open forms. The interpolated data characterizing the RBP structural 
change in between the closed and open forms were thus efficiently generated in 
the low-dimensional latent space of the VAE, which was then decoded into the 
time-series data of the inter-residue distances and was useful for driving the 
structural sampling at an atomistic resolution via the MSES scheme. The free 
energy surfaces on the latent space demonstrated the refinement of the generated 
data that had a single basin into the simulated data containing two closed and 
open basins, thus illustrating the usefulness of the MD simulation together with 
the molecular mechanics force field in recovering the correct structural 
ensemble.

Nowadays, new advances in society and health have brought an increased life 
expectancy. However, at the same time, aging comes with complications that 
impact the development of autoimmunity, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. 
These complications affect the quality of life and impact the public health 
system. Specifically, with aging, a low-grade chronic sterile systemic 
inflammation with self-reactivity in the absence of acute infection occurs 
termed inflammaging. Inflammaging is related to an imbalanced immune response 
that can be either naturally acquired with aging or accelerated due to external 
triggers. Different molecules, metabolites and inflammatory forms of cell death 
are highly involved in these processes. Importantly, adoptive cellular 
immunotherapy is a modality of treatment for cancer patients that administers ex 
vivo expanded immune cells in the patient. The manipulation of these cells 
confers them enhanced proinflammatory properties. A general consequence of 
proinflammatory events is the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer. 
Herein, we review subsets of immune cells with a pertinent role in inflammaging, 
relevant proteins involved in these inflammatory events and external triggers 
that enhance and accelerate these processes. Moreover, we mention relevant 
preclinical studies that demonstrate associations of chronic inflammation with 
cancer development.

Ecological stoichiometric studies can be useful for managing the deteriorated 
riparian zones of mega-reservoirs in which nutrients significantly impact the 
balanced vegetation cover. The present study aims to explore the effects of 
periodic submergence on the stoichiometric ecological characteristics of carbon 
(C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), as well as the growth conditions of two 
leading conifer species (Taxodium distichum and Taxodium ascendens) in the 
hydro-fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, China. The 
stoichiometrical contents of C, N, and P in fine roots, leaves, and branches, 
and the growth conditions of T. distichum and T. ascendens were measured in July 
2019. The results showed that periodic submergence affected the stoichiometric 
characteristics and growth conditions of these two woody species, and the impact 
was restrained, but both grew well. The effects of inundation on the C, N, and P 
ecological stoichiometric characteristics differed in different parts of trees. 
In general, the C contents showed the following pattern: leaves > branches > 
fine roots. The N and P content showed the following pattern: leaves > fine 
roots > branches, while the C/N and C/P ratios showed an opposite trend to that 
of N and P. The N and P content in all parts of T. distichum (with means of 
17.18 and 1.70 g/kg for leaves, 4.80 and 0.57 g/kg for branches, and 6.88 and 
1.10 g/kg for fine roots, respectively) and T. ascendens (with means of 14.56 
and 1.87 g/kg for leaves, 5.03 and 0.63 g/kg for branches, and 8.17 and 1.66 
g/kg for fine roots, respectively) were higher than the national average level 
(with means of 14.14 and 1.11 g/kg for leaves, 3.04 and 0.31 g/kg for branches, 
and 4.85 and 0.47 g/kg for fine roots, respectively). Except for N and P 
contents in the leaves of T. distichum, there was a significant correlation 
between N and P elements in other parts (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, the N/P ratio 
(10.15, 8.52, 6.44, and 7.93, 8.12, 5.20 in leaves, branches, and fine roots of 
T. distichum and T. ascendens, respectively) was lower than the critical ratio 
of 14. The growth conditions of T. distichum and T. ascendens were significantly 
negatively correlated with their leaf C contents and significantly positively 
correlated with their fine root N and P contents. This study showed that T. 
distichum and T. ascendens could maintain their normal growth needs by properly 
allocating nutrients between different organs to adapt to the long periodic 
submergence in the hydro-fluctuation zone of the TGR region.

Panonychus citri, a major citrus pest. In pest management, bifenazate is a novel 
acaricide with high biological activity against red mites, such as Tetranychus 
urticae Koch. However, in the field, pests are frequently exposed to sublethal 
or lethal concentrations of pesticides. At present, its sublethal effects on P. 
citri have not been reported. Therefore, in order to investigate sublethal 
effect of bifenazate on biological traits and enzymatic properties of P. citri. 
The newly emerged females were treated with two concentrations of bifenazate: 
LC10 and LC30, the development and fecundity were observed. The results showed 
that female adult duration, fecundity, oviposition days, longevity were decrease 
compared with control, but pre-oviposition period was longer, net reproductive 
rate (R0), mean generation (T) were decreased, intrinsic rate of increase (rm), 
finite rate (λ) were decreased in LC30, however, doubling time was increased. 
Enzymatic tests showed that CAT, POD, CarE activities were higher in treatments 
than control. The SOD and GST activities were lower in LC30 than control and 
LC10, the CYP450 activity was decreased with the increasing concentrations. This 
study demonstrated that low lethal concentrations of bifenazate adversely 
affected life table parameters, enzymatic properties in P. citri. Therefore, 
bifenazate has the potential to control this pest.

INTRODUCTION: Episodes of bleeding in patients with haemophilia (PwH) are 
associated with haemophilic arthropathy, limitations in physical performance, 
reduced quality of life (QoL), and gait disorders.
AIM: This non-randomized, controlled, interventional, prospective, single-centre 
pilot study aimed to assess the effects of an 8-week supervised therapeutic 
exercise program on musculoskeletal health, gait kinematic parameters (GKP), 
functional capacity, and QoL in adult PwH.
METHODS: Nineteen PwH were allocated to an exercise group (n = 10) or a control 
group (n = 9). The patients in the exercise group followed an 8-week supervised 
therapeutic exercise program. The Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), a 
two-dimensional video-based gait kinematic analysis (2D-GKA), the 6-min walking 
test (6MWT), and the Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults 
(Haem-A-Qol) were used as the outcome measures at baseline, after the exercise 
program (at the 8th week), and at the 6th-month follow-up.
RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in the exercise group in the 
HJHS-Total and Haem-A-Qol Total scores and the 6MWT value after the exercise 
program. Moreover, the 2D-GKA revealed improvement in most of the GKP (knee 
extension during the midstance and late swing phases, ankle dorsiflexion during 
the midstance phase, and ankle plantar flexion during the preswing phase). 
However, the gain obtained by the exercise program was not maintained at the 
6th-month follow-up for the HJHS-Total and Hem-A-QoL-Total scores and GKP.
CONCLUSION: The 8-week supervised therapeutic exercise program was successful in 
achieving improvement in joint health, GKP, functional capacity, and QoL in PwH.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To revisit the importance of prevention strategies and 
policies in reducing the burden of ischemic heart disease in South Asian 
countries.
RECENT FINDINGS: South Asia has seen rapid growth in its population with 
variable improvement in health indicators such as life expectancy at birth over 
the last three decades. Parallel to these improvements, there has been a stark 
rise in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) but without a commensurate improvement 
in infrastructure/policies and health system interventions to address NCDs. 
South Asia is the epicenter of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemic in 
Asia. It has a population that manifests accelerated atherosclerosis at a 
younger age. Poverty, lower health literacy, lack of health-promoting behaviors, 
poor urban design, rising air pollution, weak health systems, and lack and poor 
implementation of existing policies contribute to the continued rise in the 
incidence of CVD and the associated case fatality rates. A relatively young 
population presents an opportunity for implementation of prevention measures now 
which if not adequately utilized will result in an exponential rise in the CVD 
burden. There is a large gap between policymaking and implementation in this 
part of the world. Economic realities further constrain coverage of prevention 
policies; and therefore, stronger collaboration between governments, 
stakeholders, civil society, and regional and international funding agencies is 
needed to universally implement prevention strategies in South Asia.

The neuroendocrine transdifferentiation has been found in many cancer cell 
types, such as prostate, lung and gastrointestinal cells and is accompanied by a 
lower patient life expectancy. The transdifferentiation process has been induced 
in vitro by the exposure to different stimuli in human lung adenocarcinoma. The 
aim of this work was to identify the morphological characteristics of the 
neuroendocrine phenotype in a human lung cancer cell line, induced by two cAMP 
elevating agents (IBMX and FSK). Our results showed two phenotypes, one produced 
by IBMX with higher volume, cell size and increased number of secondary 
projections, and the other produced by FSK with higher area, roughness of the 
membrane, cell neurite percentage, number of outgrowths per cell and increased 
number of primary projections. In conclusion, we describe some morphological and 
ultrastructural characteristics of the neuroendocrine phenotype in A549 human 
lung cancer cell line promoted by IBMX and FSK to contribute to the 
understanding of the autocrine or paracrine signaling within the tumor 
microenvironment.

PURPOSE: To evaluate teprotumumab safety/efficacy in patients with thyroid eye 
disease (TED) who were nonresponsive or who experienced a disease flare.
DESIGN: The Treatment of Graves' Orbitopathy to Reduce Proptosis with 
Teprotumumab Infusions in an Open-Label Clinical Extension Study (OPTIC-X) is a 
teprotumumab treatment and re-treatment trial following the placebo-controlled 
teprotumumab Phase 3 Treatment of Graves' Orbitopathy (Thyroid Eye Disease) to 
Reduce Proptosis with Teprotumumab Infusions in a Randomized, 
Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Study (OPTIC) trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients who previously received placebo (n = 37) or teprotumumab 
(n = 14) in OPTIC.
METHODS: OPTIC nonresponders or those who flared (≥2-mm increase in proptosis, 
≥2-point increase in clinical activity score [CAS], or both) during follow-up 
were treated for the first time (previous placebo patients) or re-treated with 
teprotumumab in OPTIC-X with 8 infusions over 24 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proptosis response and safety. Secondary outcomes 
included proptosis, CAS, subjective diplopia, and quality-of-life.
RESULTS: Thirty-three of 37 placebo-treated OPTIC patients (89.2%) became 
proptosis responders (mean ± standard deviation, -3.5 ± 1.7 mm) when treated 
with teprotumumab in OPTIC-X. The responses were equivalent to the OPTIC study. 
In these responders, proptosis, CAS of 0 or 1, and diplopia responses were 
maintained in 29 of 32 patients (90.6%), 20 of 21 patients (95.2%), and 12 of 14 
patients (85.7%), respectively, at follow-up week 48. The median TED duration 
was 12.9 months versus 6.3 months in those treated with teprotumumab in the 
OPTIC study. Of the 5 OPTIC teprotumumab nonresponders re-treated in OPTIC-X, 2 
responded, 1 showed a proptosis reduction of 1.5 mm from OPTIC baseline, and 2 
discontinued treatment early. Of the OPTIC teprotumumab responders who 
experienced flare, 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) responded when re-treated (mean 
proptosis reduction, 1.9 ± 1.2 mm from OPTIC-X baseline and 3.3 ± 0.7 mm from 
OPTIC baseline). Compared with published double-masked trials and their 
integrated follow-up, no new safety signals were identified. Mild hearing 
impairment was reported; 4 events occurred during the first course of treatment, 
and 2 events reoccurred after re-treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TED of longer disease duration responded similarly to 
those treated earlier in the disease course. Patients with an insufficient 
initial response or flare may benefit from additional teprotumumab therapy. No 
new safety risk was identified; however additional postmarketing 
pharmacovigilance is ongoing.

OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused suspension of 
directly observed therapy (DOT) for patients with active tuberculosis (TB). This 
study aimed to estimate the outcomes of pandemic-related DOT suspension and the 
cost-effectiveness of video-observed therapy (VOT) during the pandemic.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to project outcomes of adult 
patients with active TB from the perspective of a US healthcare provider. Two 
model-based analyses were conducted: (1) before (with DOT) and during [with 
self-administered therapy (SAT)] the pandemic; and (2) VOT vs SAT during the 
pandemic. The primary outcome measures were direct medical costs and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, care during the pandemic (with SAT) 
increased the cost (by US$285 per patient) and DALYs (by 0.2155 per patient) in 
comparison with DOT. Care with VOT reduced DALYs (by 0.4870) and costs (by 
US$1797) in comparison with SAT. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, care 
during the pandemic (with SAT) increased DALYs in 100% of 10,000 simulations, 
and increased costs in 55.52% of instances. Care with VOT reduced DALYs and 
costs in 99.7% and 68.79% of instances, respectively. The probability of VOT 
being cost-effective was 99.4% at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 
US$/DALY.
CONCLUSION: Suspension of DOT during the COVID-19 pandemic worsened treatment 
outcomes. VOT was found to be a cost-effective option for active TB care in an 
outpatient setting.

folyamatok során a betegek jelentős részében vénás, ritkábban artériás 
thrombosisok alakulnak ki, tovább súlyosbítva a klinikai állapotot. Célkitűzés: 
A 2020. szeptember és 2021. március közötti időszakban 1590, koronavírus-2 által 
megfertőzött, tüdőgyulladással szövődött beteget láttunk el osztályunkon. 
Betegeinkben azt vizsgáltuk, hogy milyen jellegű és arányú a thromboemboliás 
szövődmények előfordulása. Módszer: Az 1590, koronavírus-2 által fertőzött beteg 
mindegyikében meghatároztuk a pneumonia súlyosságát; klinikai gyanú eseteiben 
alsó végtagi Doppler-ultrahangvizsgálatot, valamint komputertomográfiával 
végzett tüdőangiográfiát végeztünk. Eredmények: A képalkotó vizsgálatok 
eredményei azt igazolták, hogy a koronavírus-2 által okozott tüdőgyulladással 
kezeltekben 13%-os gyakorisággal fordult elő mélyvénás thrombosis; akut 
tüdőemboliát a betegek 17%-ában kórisméztünk. Következtetés: A koronavírus-2 
által okozott fertőzésekben elsősorban a tüdőben, de egyéb szervekben is (szív, 
vese, máj) súlyos gyulladással járó kórfolyamatok alakulhatnak ki, amelyek 
hatására fokozott thrombosiskészség jelentkezik a gyulladásos és koagulációs 
rendszer interakciója következtében. A fokozott thrombosishajlam 
végeredményeként vénás és ritkábban artériás thrombosisok kialakulása 
súlyosbítja a betegek klinikai állapotát, s kedvezőtlen hatást gyakorol az 
életkilátásra. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(43): 1710-1716.
INTRODUCTION: The infections caused by coronavirus-2 very often lead to severe, 
acute respiratory damages, because of which respiratory insufficiency is 
manifested. As a result, since the development of pneumonias (December, 2019), 
many patients have required hospitalization. When treating the severe pneumonia 
cases, it was proved that in a significant number of patients with respiratory 
inflammatory processes, venous, less often arterial thrombosis occured, making 
the clinical state even more severe.
OBJECTIVE: We treated 1590 coronavirus-2 infected, pneumonia-connected patients 
between September, 2020 and March, 2021 at our department. We examined the 
nature and the proportion of the thromboembolic complications.
METHOD: We determined the severity of pneumonia in the 1950 coronavirus-2 
infected patients; when clinically suspected, they had lower limb Doppler 
ultrasound examination and angiography carried out with computer tomograph.
RESULTS: The result of imaging examinations proved that in 13% of cases deep 
vein thrombosis occured; in 17% of cases acute pulmonary embolia occured with 
pneumonia caused by coronavirus-2.
CONCLUSION: In coronavirus-2 infected cases, mainly in the lung, but also in 
other organs (heart, kidney, liver), severe inflammatory disease-processes may 
occur, as a result of which increased thrombosis tendency shows because of the 
ineraction of the inflammatory and coagulatory system. As a result of the 
increased thrombosis tendency, venous and less often arterial thrombosis worsen 
the clinical state of patients, and have unfavourable effect on life expectancy.

Socioeconomic Inequalities in Mortality After Age 67: The Contribution of 
Psychological Factors.

Diverging trends of longer lives and increased inequalities in age-at-death 
invite to updated research on late-life mortality. Earlier studies have 
identified health behavior, childhood, psychosocial, and material conditions as 
key determinants of life expectancy, but the role of psychological factors 
remains a topic of debate. The current study is framed in a life course 
developmental perspective and assesses the mediating role of secondary control 
strategies (subjective age) and primary control capacity (perceived control) to 
socioeconomic (wealth and education) inequality in mortality after age 67. Data 
are derived from the second wave of the Norwegian Life Course, Ageing and 
Generation study (N=1,432 and age 67-85). All in all, 366 deaths were observed 
over a mean follow-up of 9.6years. Perceived control was measured by the Pearlin 
and Schooler Mastery Scale. SA was measured with proportional discrepancy scores 
in felt age and ideal age. Stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression analyses 
were conducted to analyze the relative contribution of SES (education and 
accumulated wealth), felt age, and ideal age discrepancies and perceived control 
on 11-year mortality. Findings show that lower levels of wealth and perceived 
control independently predict increased elderly mortality over an 11-year 
period. Feeling younger and smaller ideal age discrepancies are positively 
associated with perceived control, but do not account for additional variability 
in longevity among older adults. Findings add to the interdisciplinary field of 
socioeconomic inequalities in elderly mortality and underline the specific 
importance of structural conditions (wealth) and the continued importance of 
(perceived) primary control capacity for longevity also after age 67. Future 
research may assess in more detail how wealth and perceived control complement 
each other in contributing to healthy aging and longevity, for example, by 
longitudinal research including the role of significant life events in the 
second half of life in different welfare state contexts.

OBJECTIVE: Efficacy of pharmacological treatments for acromegaly has been 
assessed in many clinical or real-world studies but no study was interested in 
economics evaluation of these treatments in France. Therefore, the objective of 
this study was to estimate the cost-utility of second-line pharmacological 
treatments in acromegaly patients.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to follow a cohort of 1,000 patients for a 
lifetime horizon. First-generation somatostatin analogues (FGSA), pegvisomant, 
pasireotide and pegvisomant combined with FGSA (off label) were compared. 
Efficacy was defined as the normalization of insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) concentration and was obtained from pivotal trials and adjusted by a 
network meta-analysis. Costs data were obtained from French databases and 
literature. Utilities from the literature were used to estimate quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY).
RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of treatments compared to 
FGSA were estimated to be 562,463 € per QALY gained for pasireotide, 171,332 € 
per QALY gained for pegvisomant, and 186,242 € per QALY gained for pegvisomant + 
FGSA. Pasireotide seems to be the least cost-efficient treatment. Sensitivity 
analyses showed the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSION: FGSA, pegvisomant and pegvisomant + FGSA were on the cost-effective 
frontier, therefore, depending on the willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY, 
they are the most cost-effective treatments. This medico-economic analysis 
highlighted the consistency of the efficiency results with the efficacy results 
assessed in the pivotal trials. However, most recent treatment guidelines 
recommend an individualized treatment strategy based on the patient and disease 
profile.

Increasing the number of environments for phenotyping of crop lines in earlier 
stages of breeding programs can improve selection accuracy. However, this is 
often not feasible due to cost. In our study, we investigated a sparse 
phenotyping method that does not test all entries in all environments, but 
instead capitalizes on genomic prediction to predict missing phenotypes in 
additional environments without extra phenotyping expenditure. The breeders' 
main interest - response to selection - was directly simulated to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the sparse genomic phenotyping method in a wheat and a rice 
data set. Whether sparse phenotyping resulted in more selection response 
depended on the correlations of phenotypes between environments. The sparse 
phenotyping method consistently showed statistically significant higher 
responses to selection, compared to complete phenotyping, when the majority of 
completely phenotyped environments were negatively (wheat) or lowly positively 
(rice) correlated and any extension environment was highly positively correlated 
with any of the completely phenotyped environments. When all environments were 
positively correlated (wheat) or any highly positively correlated environments 
existed (wheat and rice), sparse phenotyping did not improved response. Our 
results indicate that genomics-based sparse phenotyping can improve selection 
response in the middle stages of crop breeding programs.

Mimicry and secondary defense are staples among predator-prey interactions. 
Among insects, the stick and leaf insects are masters of camouflage. 
Nonetheless, a meager understanding of their origin and early mimetic evolution 
persists. Here, we report the earliest mimetic and defensive strategies of a 
stick insect from the Middle Jurassic of China, Aclistophasma echinulatum gen. 
et sp. nov., exquisitely preserving abdominal extensions and femoral spines. The 
distribution of these characteristics mapped onto the phylogeny of Phasmatodea 
reveals that abdominal extensions and femoral spines developed multiple times 
during the evolution of stick insects, and indicates that the origin of 
abdominal extensions predates other modifications, while tergal extensions 
predate other expansions of the body, such as those of the sterna and pleura, as 
well as defensive femoral spines. The new fossil provides clues into early 
antipredator defensive strategies, allows inferences as to the potential 
environment and predators, and reveals the mimetic and defensive mechanisms of 
stick insects from 165 million years ago.

The primary objective is to classify acquired cholesteatoma according to the 
ChOLE classification system based on the preoperative and intraoperative 
findings, and to describe prevalence of each stage. The secondary objective is 
to correlate the extent of inside out approach mastoidectomy required with the 
staged extent of cholesteatoma. A non-randomized Prospective Observational study 
conducted in 67 patients in a tertiary care hospital. Each case was categorized 
according to the ChOLE classification system including cholesteatoma extension, 
ossicular chain status, life threatening complications and eustachian tube 
dysfunction. Based on the extent of disease, inside out approach mastoidectomy 
was done and results analysed. Most patients presented with stage 2 disease 
[67%]. Canal wall was preserved for all stage I, and in stage II cholesteatoma 
canal wall was either kept intact, reconstructed or lowered based on the extent 
of erosion of posterior meatal wall and cholesteatoma extension. All stage III 
underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy. Staging of cholesteatoma by ChOLE 
classification allows standardization in reporting gravity of disease and 
surgical outcomes. Inside out approach mastoidectomy contributes to the 
successful surgical management of cholesteatoma by eradicating the disease with 
the creation of a smaller cavity.

Will counties that reallocate money from law enforcement to social services 
improve subsequent markers of population wellbeing? In this study, we measure 
the association between county government spending across multiple sectors and 
Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) in the U.S. using data from the U.S. Census 
Bureau. We constructed a Structural Equation Model to determine whether social 
expenditure, building infrastructure, and spending on law and order were 
positively or negatively associated with LEB three-years after initial spending. 
The analysis compared data between 2002-05 and 2007-10 and was stratified for 
urban and rural counties. In rural counties, a one-standard-deviation increase 
in social spending increased subsequent LEB by 0.58 (SE 0.16) and 0.36 (SE 0.16) 
years in 2005 and 2010, respectively. In urban counties, a 
one-standard-deviation increase in building infrastructure spending increased 
subsequent LEB by 1.14 (SE 0.51) and 1.05 (SE 0.49) years in 2005 and 2010, 
respectively. In 2002, a one-standard-deviation increase in law and order 
spending significantly decreased subsequent life expectancy, 2.2 (SE 1.27) and 
0.46 (SE 0.13) years in urban and rural counties, respectively. Similarly, 
investments in building infrastructure for urban counties and social services 
for rural counties were associated with subsequently higher life expectancy 
three years later after initial investments.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged need for mechanical ventilation greatly impacts life 
expectancy of patients after spinal cord injury (SCI). Weaning outcomes have 
never been systematically assessed. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 
we aimed to investigate the probability of weaning success, duration of 
mechanical ventilation, mortality, and their predictors in mechanically 
ventilated patients with SCI.
METHODS: We searched six databases from inception until August 2021 for 
randomized-controlled trials and observational studies enrolling adult patients 
(≥ 16 years) with SCI from any cause requiring mechanical ventilation. Titles 
and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers. Full texts of the 
identified articles were then assessed for eligibility. Data were extracted 
independently and in duplicate by pairs of authors, using a standardized data 
collection form. Synthetic results are reported as meta-analytic means and 
proportions, based on random effects models.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies (14,637 patients, mean age 43) were selected. 
Cervical lesions were predominant (12,717 patients had cervical lesions only, 
1843 in association with other levels' lesions). Twenty-five studies were 
conducted in intensive care units (ICUs), 14 in rehabilitative settings. In ICU, 
the mean time from injury to hospitalization was 8 h [95% CI 7-9], mean duration 
of mechanical ventilation 27 days [20-34], probability of weaning success 63% 
[45-78] and mortality 8% [5-11]. Patients hospitalized in rehabilitation centres 
had a greater number of high-level lesions (C3 or above), were at 40 days 
[29-51] from injury and were ventilated for a mean of 97 days [65-128]; 82% 
[70-90] of them were successfully weaned, while mortality was 1% [0-19].
CONCLUSIONS: Although our study highlights the lack of uniform definition of 
weaning success, of clear factors associated with weaning outcomes, and of 
high-level evidence to guide optimal weaning in patients with SCI, it shows that 
around two-thirds of mechanically ventilated patients can be weaned in ICU after 
SCI. A substantial gain in weaning success can be obtained during 
rehabilitation, with additional duration of stay but minimal increase in 
mortality. The study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020156788).

INTRODUCTION: The JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial showed that maintenance avelumab 
therapy after chemotherapy improved the survival of patients with advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of 
maintenance therapy with avelumab plus best supportive care (BSC) in patients 
with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after receiving first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to analyze the economic outcomes of maintenance 
avelumab plus BSC (avelumab strategy) in the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. 
The clinical data were derived from the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial. All cost 
information was obtained from Medicare and published literature. The total cost, 
total life years (LYs), total quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental net health benefit (INHB) were 
calculated. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
were also performed.
RESULTS: Our results showed that avelumab strategy versus BSC strategy cost 
US $176,352 and $238,661 and yielded an additional 0.465 and 1.007 QALY in all 
patients with unknown programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status and the 
PD-L1-positive subpopulation, respectively, which led to an ICER of 
$102,365/QALY and $106,253/QALY gained. In all patients with unknown PD-L1 
status, maintenance avelumab plus BSC therapy guiding by PD-L1 expression 
testing (PD-L1-guided strategy) compared with the avelumab strategy and BSC 
strategy resulted in ICER of $105,360/QALY and $122,653/QALY, respectively. The 
probabilities of the avelumab strategy and the PD-L1-guided strategy being 
cost-effective in the simultaneous competition of the three strategies were 
38.49% and 48.82%. In patients with PD-L1-positive status, the avelumab strategy 
had an 87.51% probability of cost-effectiveness. The most influential parameter 
for the model was the cost of avelumab and pembrolizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated that maintenance therapy with avelumab 
plus BSC may be a cost-effective option for patients with advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY, 
especially for patients with PD-L1-positive status.
