The geroscience hypothesis posits that therapies to slow biological processes of 
aging can prevent disease and extend healthy years of life. To test such 
"geroprotective" therapies in humans, outcome measures are needed that can 
assess extension of disease-free life span. This need has spurred development of 
different methods to quantify biological aging. But different methods have not 
been systematically compared in the same humans. We implemented 7 methods to 
quantify biological aging using repeated-measures physiological and genomic data 
in 964 middle-aged humans in the Dunedin Study (New Zealand; persons born 
1972-1973). We studied 11 measures in total: telomere-length and erosion, 3 
epigenetic-clocks and their ticking rates, and 3 biomarker-composites. Contrary 
to expectation, we found low agreement between different measures of biological 
aging. We next compared associations between biological aging measures and 
outcomes that geroprotective therapies seek to modify: physical functioning, 
cognitive decline, and subjective signs of aging, including aged facial 
appearance. The 71-cytosine-phosphate-guanine epigenetic clock and biomarker 
composites were consistently related to these aging-related outcomes. However, 
effect sizes were modest. Results suggested that various proposed approaches to 
quantifying biological aging may not measure the same aspects of the aging 
process. Further systematic evaluation and refinement of measures of biological 
aging is needed to furnish outcomes for geroprotector trials.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of replacing standard 
intravenous therapy (taxane) with oral S-1 therapy for first-line metastatic 
breast cancer treatment.
METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was based on data from a randomized 
phase III trial (SELECT BC). As cost-effectiveness was a secondary endpoint of 
the SELECT BC trial, some of the randomized patients participated in an EQ-5D 
survey (N = 391) and health economic survey (N = 146). The EQ-5D responses, 
claims, and prescription data were collected for as long as possible until 
death. The expected quality-adjusted life years (QALY) obtained from each 
treatment were calculated using patient-level EQ-5D data, and the expected cost 
was calculated using patient-level claim data. The analysis was performed from 
the perspective of public healthcare payers.
RESULTS: The estimated EQ-5D least-square means and 95% CI up to 48 months were 
0.764 (95% CI, 0.741-0.782) and 0.742 (95% CI, 0.720-0.764) in the S-1 and 
taxane arms, respectively. The expected QALY was 2.11 for the S-1 arm and 2.04 
for the taxane arm, with expected costs of JPY 5.13 million (USD 46,600) and JPY 
5.56 million (USD 50,500), respectively. These results show that S-1 is 
cost-saving. According to probabilistic sensitivity analysis, S-1 was dominant 
with a probability of 63%. When the willingness to pay (WTP) value was JPY 5 
million (USD 45,500) per QALY, the probability of being cost-effective was 92%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the introduction of oral S-1 therapy for 
metastatic breast cancer is highly likely to be cost-effective.

Cancer is a disease of the elderly as demonstrated by the epidemiological 
evolution of Western countries. Indeed, two third of cancers newly diagnosed 
occur over 65 years. However, older cancer patients have been often excluded 
from clinical trials in oncology and the extrapolation of cancer treatments in 
this population remains difficult in practice. Scientific societies recommend 
that a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) be performed in patients aged 70 
and over and selected using screening tools for frailty such as the G8 index. 
The CGA allows to detect aging-related vulnerabilities in various domains 
(comorbidities, polypharmacy, autonomy, nutrition, mobility, cognition, mood, 
social) and associated with adverse outcomes during cancer treatment (reduced 
overall survival, perioperative complications, toxicity-related chemotherapy). 
The CGA is allow to elaborate a personalized treatment plan in geriatric 
oncology. However, to date, no algorithms based on CGA is validated to guide 
therapeutic decision in geriatric oncology. The collaboration between 
geriatrician and oncologist remains essential to elaborate an appropriate 
therapeutic strategy and limit the situations of over- and under-treatment. This 
article presents the set of tools and scores used in geriatric oncology to guide 
the therapeutic decision.

BACKGROUND: 18% of the world's population lives in India, and many states of 
India have populations similar to those of large countries. Action to 
effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable 
and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over 
time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major 
diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and 
risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) Study 2016.
METHODS: Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden 
Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years 
[DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions 
and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as 
part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological 
transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those 
from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed 
variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups 
and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the 
states and for India as a whole.
FINDINGS: DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 
for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state 
groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36·2% in India from 1990 to 
2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs 
between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs 
were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased 
substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for 
injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of 
most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a 
modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major 
risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting 
plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 
1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air 
pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence 
rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The 
five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart 
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower 
respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk 
factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, 
dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. 
Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups 
and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease 
burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference 
between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes.
INTERPRETATION: Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by 
about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes 
of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The 
change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter 
century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of 
the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL 
states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its 
causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific 
health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India's 
premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the 
National Health Policy 2017.

BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of shunt 
surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).
METHODS: Health-related quality of life was evaluated before and 6 months after 
surgery using the EQ-5D-3 L (EuroQOL group five-dimensions health survey) in 30 
patients (median age, 71 years; range, 65-89 years) diagnosed with iNPH. The 
costs associated with shunt surgery were assessed by a detailed survey with 
interviews and extraction of register data concerning the cost of hospital care, 
primary care, residential care, home-care service and informal care. The cost of 
untreated patients was derived from the cost of dementia disorders in Sweden in 
2012, as reported by the National Board of Health and Welfare. The cost 
effectiveness analysis used a decision-analytic Markov model. We used a societal 
perspective and a lifelong time horizon to estimate costs and effects. One-way 
sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were carried out to 
test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The shunt surgery model as the standard treatment in iNPH resulted in a 
gain of 2.2 life years and 1.7 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), along with an 
incremental cost per patient of €7,500/QALY. The sensitivity analysis showed 
that the results were not sensitive to changes in uncertain parameters or 
assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Shunt surgery in iNPH, an underdiagnosed condition severely 
impairing elderly patients, is not only an effective medical treatment, it is 
also cost-effective, adding 2.2 additional life years and 1.7 QALYs at a low 
cost, a remarkable gain for an individual aged around 70 years.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) support tumor development by 
stimulation of angiogenesis and immune response inhibition. In our previous 
study, we showed that interferon lambda 2 (IFN-λ2), secreted by MDSCs, enhances 
production of pro-angiogenic factors by cancer cells via phosphorylation of 
STAT3 and therefore promotes blood vessels formation. In the present study 
IFN-λ2 level was evaluated by ELISA in serum of tumor-bearing mice, whereas its 
expression in MDSCs isolated from the lungs with metastatic tumors and normal 
lungs was assessed by qPCR. The effect of IFN-λ2 on mouse mammary cancer cells 
motility was tested in Boyden chamber migration assay. In order to evaluate its 
pro-angiogenic function we performed in vitro tubule formation assay and in ovo 
angiogenesis assay on chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Moreover, 
in order to design small molecule inhibitors of IFN-λ2 and its receptor we 
performed molecular modeling followed by the identification of potential natural 
inhibitors. Then, we examined their ability to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro. 
Our results showed that IFN-λ2 predisposed mouse mammary cancer cells to 
migration in vitro. It also enhanced angiogenesis induced by mouse mammary 
cancer cells in vitro and in ovo. For the first time we selected potential 
IFN-λ2 inhibitors and we validated that they were capable to abolish 
pro-angiogenic effect of IFN-λ2, similarly to blocking antibodies. Therefore, 
IFN-λ2 and its receptor may become targets of anti-cancer therapy, but their 
mechanism of action requires further investigation.

Penile cancer accounts for 1-10% of men neoplastic diseases and 30-60% of 
patients have inguinal metastases at the time of diagnosis. Inguinal metastases 
of penile cancer with femoral vessel involvement could lead to vascular fistula 
and hemorrhagic shock. We present 3 consecutive patients with inguinal 
metastases of penile cancer complicated by infection and hemorrhage from femoral 
vessels invaded by the tumor. Simultaneous extra-anatomical axillo-femoral 
bypass graft, wide excision of tumor and groin defect reconstruction was used to 
achieve "tumor-free" oncologic aim and to save the lower limb. We consider the 
extra-anatomic axillo-femoral bypass associated with wide inguinal tumor 
excision and defect covering a feasible surgical solution for improving the life 
quality and extend life expectancy in patients with lymph node metastasis of 
penile cancer complicated by necrosis, infection and femoral vessel involvement.

BACKGROUND: In this era of modern medicine, there is an increase in life 
expectancy and thereby an ageing population. Among this group one of the most 
common neurological disorder is Parkinson disease and one of the most common 
operation done in elderly population is a total joint arthroplasty. But total 
joint arthroplasty in Parkinson disease is a relatively uncommon entity. There 
is sparse literature available with regards to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in 
Parkinson disease. This review focusses on the necessity, complications and 
previous experiences on TKA in PD based on the literature available.
METHOD: The review was conducted after a series of advanced search in the 
following medical databases; Pub med, Biomed central, Cochrane and Google 
scholar for articles related to total knee replacement in patients with 
Parkinson's disease. The following keywords were used; Total knee arthroplasty, 
Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr, Flexion Contracture.
RESULTS: The review indicates that the functional outcome is comparable to that 
of controls in immediate post-operative phase, one year and three-year phase, 
but the long term functional outcome seems to deteriorate significantly.
CONCLUSION: Total knee arthroplasty can serve as an effective tool in 
alleviating pain in short term as well as long term periods, whereas the 
functional outcome seems to deteriorate post operatively on a long-term basis. 
Nevertheless, TKA in PD is a challenging situation, thereby necessitating a 
holistic approach with the efforts from various specialists needed at each stage 
to ensure a successful operation.

Particulate matter (PM), a key indicator of air pollution by natural and 
anthropogenic activities, contributes to a wide spectrum of diseases that lead 
to a shortening of life expectancy. It has been recognized that trace metals in 
airborne PM are highly toxic and can be correlated with lesion in respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, immunological, and hematological systems. Traditional methods 
for trace metal assay require sophisticated instrumentations and highly trained 
operators in centralized laboratories. In this work, by integrating the 
technologies of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, additive 
manufacturing, smartphone, and colorimetric sensing, we developed the first 
smartphone based paper microfluidic platform for portable, disposable, and 
quantitative measurements of cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) in ambient 
air and street sediments. On a single A4-sized paper, 48 devices were fabricated 
in under 30 s with a total cost of ∼$1.9. On each device, 12 reaction units were 
patterned and used for colorimetric tests. Particulate samples from urban 
ambient air and street sediments were collected, processed, and analyzed. 
Signals of the on-chip complexation product were recorded using a smartphone 
camera and processed by a self-developed app on an iOS system. For precisely 
controlling the object distance, chip position, and luminance, a hand-held 3D 
cellphone housing was designed and printed. The detection limits of Co, Cu, and 
Fe were determined to be 8.2, 45.8, and 186.0 ng, while the linear dynamic 
ranges were calculated to be 8.2-81.6, 45.8-4.58 × 102, and 
1.86 × 102-1.86 × 103 ng, representing a practically relevant device performance 
with a significant reduction in the detection cost and time consumption. Trace 
metals in ambient air and sediments of two cities in China have been quantified 
portably, thus demonstrating the utility of our system in improving strategies 
for air pollution control in low-resource settings.

Minocycline treatment increases resistance to oxidative stress and extends 
lifespan in Drosophila via FOXO.

Minocycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline derivative antibiotic that has 
received increasing attention for its non-antibiotic properties, mainly 
anti-inflammatory, tumor-suppressive, and neuroprotective effects. Drosophila is 
a widely used genetically tractable model organism for studying organismal aging 
by virtue of its short lifespan and ease of cultivation. In this study, we 
examined the effects of minocycline on Drosophila lifespan and its associated 
traits. Minocycline-supplemented food significantly extended lifespan in both 
Canton S and w1118 Drosophila strains. The drug-induced lifespan extension was 
not associated with reduced dietary intake or reduced female fecundity, but 
rather with increased resistance to an oxidative stressor (hydrogen peroxide). 
Notably, minocycline's effects on lifespan and resistance to oxidative stress 
were largely abrogated in Forkhead box O (FOXO) null mutant, and the drug 
treatment increased the activity of FOXO. These results may further our 
understanding of minocycline's beneficial effects against several age-associated 
deteriorations observed in animal models.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term healthcare costs and health outcomes in 
association with the access to new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), during the 
first year of the National Strategic Plan for Chronic Hepatitis C (SPCHC) in 
patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Spain.
METHODS: A decision tree and a lifetime Markov model were developed to simulate 
the natural history, morbidity, and mortality of a cohort of 51,900 patients 
with CHC before (pre-DAA strategy) and after (post-DAA strategy) access to DAAs, 
following SPCHC approval. The percentage of patients treated, transition 
probabilities, disease management costs, health state utility values, sustained 
virologic response rates and treatment costs were obtained from the literature 
and published data from Spain. The results were expressed in terms of costs (€, 
2016), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and prevention of clinical events, 
with an annual discount rate of 3%.
RESULTS: The post-DAA strategy would prevent 8,667 cases of decompensated 
cirrhosis, 5,471 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 1,137 liver transplants and 
9,608 liver-related deaths. The cohort of 51,900 patients would require 
investments of 1,606 and 1,230 million euros with the post-DAA and pre-DAA 
strategies, respectively. This would produce 819,674 and 665,703 QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of new DAA-based treatments in CHC patients during the 
first year after the implementation of the SPCHC significantly reduced long-term 
morbidity and mortality and increased quality of life; demonstrating that this 
plan is an efficient use of public health resources.

(3)Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

CONTEXT: Effective community-based interventions are available to control 
hypertension. It is important to determine the economics of these interventions.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Peer-reviewed studies from January 1995 through December 
2015 were screened. Interventions were categorized into educational 
interventions, self-monitoring interventions, and screening interventions. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were summarized by types of interventions. 
The review was conducted in 2016.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Thirty-four articles were included in the review (16 from 
the U.S., 18 from other countries), including 25 on educational interventions, 
three on self-monitoring interventions, and six on screening interventions. In 
the U.S., five (31.3%) studies on educational interventions were cost saving. 
Among the studies that found the interventions cost effective, the median 
incremental costs were $62 (range, $40-$114) for 1-mmHg reduction in systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and $13,986 (range, $6,683-$58,610) for 1 life-year gained. 
Outside the U.S., educational interventions cost from $0.62 (China) to $29 
(Pakistan) for 1-mmHg reduction in SBP. Self-monitoring interventions, evaluated 
in the U.S. only, cost $727 for 1-mmHg reduction in SBP and $41,927 for 1 
life-year gained. For 1 quality-adjusted life-year, screening interventions cost 
from $21,734 to $56,750 in the U.S., $613 to $5,637 in Australia, and $7,000 to 
$18,000 in China. Intervention costs to reduce 1 mmHg blood pressure or 1 
quality-adjusted life-year were higher in the U.S. than in other countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Most studies found that the three types of interventions were 
either cost effective or cost saving. Quality of economic studies should be 
improved to confirm the findings.

Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

CONTEXT: Hypertension affects one third of the U.S. adult population. Although 
cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines have been published, a 
comprehensive systematic review across medicine classes is not available.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Health Technology 
Assessment were searched to identify original cost-effectiveness analyses 
published from 1990 through August 2016. Results were summarized by medicine 
class: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), thiazide-type diuretics, 
β-blockers, and others. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
adjusted to 2015 U.S. dollars.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Among 76 studies reviewed, 14 compared medicines with no 
treatment, 16 compared medicines with conventional therapy, 29 compared between 
medicine classes, 13 compared within medicine class, and 11 compared combination 
therapies. All antihypertensives were cost effective compared with no treatment 
(ICER/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]=dominant-$19,945). ARBs were more cost 
effective than CCBs (ICER/QALY=dominant-$13,016) in nine comparisons, whereas 
CCBs were more cost effective than ARBs (ICER/QALY=dominant) in two comparisons. 
ARBs were more cost effective than ACEIs (ICER/QALY=dominant-$34,244) and 
β-blockers (ICER/QALY=$1,498-$18,137) in all eight comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: All antihypertensives were cost effective compared with no 
treatment. ARBs appeared to be more cost effective than CCBs, ACEIs, and 
β-blockers. However, these latter findings should be interpreted with caution 
because these findings are not robust due to the substantial variability across 
the studies, including study settings and analytic models, changes in the cost 
of generic medicines, and publication bias.

The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended five interventions for 
cardiovascular disease prevention between 2012 and 2015. Systematic economic 
reviews of these interventions faced challenges that made it difficult to 
generate meaningful policy and programmatic conclusions. This paper describes 
the methods used to assess, synthesize, and evaluate the economic evidence to 
generate reliable and useful economic conclusions and address the comparability 
of economic findings across interventions. Specifically, steps were taken to 
assess completeness of data and identify the components and drivers of cost and 
benefit. Except for the intervention cost of self-measured blood pressure 
monitoring intervention, either alone or with patient support, all cost and 
benefit estimates were standardized as per patient per year. When possible, 
intermediate outcomes were converted to quality-adjusted life year. Differences 
within and between interventions were considered to generate economic 
conclusions and inform their comparability. The literature search period varied 
among interventions. This analysis was completed in 2016. Although team-based 
care, self-measured blood pressure monitoring with patient support, and 
self-measured blood pressure monitoring within team-based care were found to be 
cost effective, their cost-effectiveness estimates were not comparable because 
of differences in the intervention characteristics. Lack of enough data or 
incomplete information made it difficult to reach an overall economic finding 
for the other interventions. The Community Guide methods discussed here may help 
others conducting systematic economic reviews of public health interventions to 
respond to challenges with the synthesis of evidence and provide useful findings 
for public health decision makers.

INTRODUCTION: Studies have demonstrated that intravenous recombinant tissue 
plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) is a cost-effective treatment for acute ischemic 
stroke. Age-specific cost effectiveness has not been well examined. This study 
estimated age-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of IV rtPA 
treatment versus no IV rtPA.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to examine the economic impact of IV rtPA 
over a 20-year time horizon on four age groups (18-44, 45-64, 65-80, and ≥81 
years) from the U.S. healthcare sector perspective. The model used health 
outcomes from a national stroke registry adjusted by parameters from previous 
literature and current hospitalization costs in 2013 U.S. dollars. Long-term 
annual costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the years after a stroke 
were discounted at 3% per year. Incremental costs, incremental QALYs, and ICERs 
were estimated and sensitivity analyses were conducted between 2015 and 2017.
RESULTS: Use of IV rtPA gained 0.55 QALYs and cost $3,941 more than no IV rtPA 
for stroke patients aged ≥18 years over a 20-year time horizon. IV rtPA was a 
dominant strategy compared to no IV rtPA for patients aged 18-44 and 45-64 
years. For patients aged 65-80 years, IV rtPA gained 0.44 QALYs and cost $4,872 
more than no IV rtPA (ICER=$11,132/QALY). For patients aged ≥81 years, ICER was 
estimated at $48,676/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: IV rtPA saved costs and improved health outcomes for patients aged 
18-64 years and was cost effective for those aged ≥65 years. These findings 
support the use of IV rtPA.

INTRODUCTION: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a 
single dose of the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in people aged ≥60 
years. Because vaccine-induced protection decreases to zero after 10 years, many 
vaccinated people will soon be subject to an increased risk of the disease. The 
study objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of a herpes zoster 
vaccine booster and its optimal timing among immunocompetent adults first 
vaccinated at aged ≥60 years.
METHODS: A Markov model was built to follow vaccinated individuals for a 
lifetime. From the societal perspective, costs and quality-adjusted life years 
were compared between no booster versus booster options. A booster was given any 
time between 1 and 20 years after the first dose, and for those who had the 
first dose at different ages: 60, 70, and 80 years. Because people entered the 
model already vaccinated, costs and side effects of the first dose were not 
included. The booster was assumed to have the same efficacy and waning rate as 
the initial vaccination. Model inputs were based on published literature. A cost 
effectiveness threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year was used. The 
analysis was conducted in 2016.
RESULTS: Cost effectiveness of a booster varied by age and time since 
vaccination. The booster cost <$100,000/quality-adjusted life year if given >5 
years after the initial dose, but was most cost effective at around 10 years. 
The finding was robust to wide variations in model inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: Under current assumptions, a booster dose of herpes zoster vaccine 
would be cost effective for all vaccinated people 10 years after initial 
vaccination.

What are the keys to a longer, happier life? Answers from five decades of health 
psychology research.

RATIONALE: It has long been known that factors of the mind and of interpersonal 
relationships influence health, but it is only in the last 50 years that an 
independent scientific field of health psychology appeared, dedicated to 
understanding psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and 
healthcare.
OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: This article (a) reviews important research that answers 
the question of how human beings can have longer, happier lives; and (b) 
highlights trends in health psychology featuring articles in Social Science & 
Medicine as well as other related literature.
RESULTS: Since the 1970s, health psychology has embraced a biopsychosocial model 
such that biological factors interact and are affected by psychological and 
social elements. This model has illuminated all subjects of health, ranging from 
interventions to lower stress and/or to improve people's ability to cope with 
stressors, to mental and physical health. Importantly, a health psychology 
perspective is behavioral: The majority of chronic diseases of today can be 
avoided or reduced through healthy lifestyles (e.g., sufficient exercise, proper 
diet, sufficient sleep). Thus, behavior change is the key target to help reduce 
the immense public health burden of chronic lifestyle illnesses. Health 
psychology also focuses on how social patterns influence health behavior and 
outcomes, in the form of patient-provider interactions or as social forces in 
communities where people live, work, and play. Health psychology is congenial to 
other health sciences, especially when allied with ecological perspectives that 
incorporate factors upstream from individual behavior, such as networks linked 
to individuals (e.g., peer groups, communities). Over its history, health 
psychology research has been responsive to societal and medical needs and has 
routinely focused on understanding health disparities.
CONCLUSION: By relying on a strong interdisciplinary approach, research in 
health psychology provides a remarkably comprehensive perspective on how people 
can live healthier lives.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive 
treatment for elderly patients with aortic stenosis. However, the cost of TAVI 
is a major issue. This study analyzed the cost effectiveness of TAVI in Japan.
METHODS: We developed an economic model to evaluate the quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and costs of TAVI, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and 
medical therapy over a 10-year time horizon from the perspective of Japanese 
public healthcare payers. The first model compared transapical or transfemoral 
TAVI with Sapien valve implantation and medical therapy in inoperable patients. 
The second model compared transfemoral TAVI with Sapien XT valve implantation 
and SAVR in operable patients with intermediate surgical risk. We assumed a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of 5,000,000yen per QALY, and assessed the 
cost-effectiveness probability with 100,000 simulations. We performed a broad 
sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of uncertainty on our results.
RESULTS: Among inoperable patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
TAVI compared with medical therapy was 3,918,808yen per QALY. In operable 
patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TAVI compared with SAVR 
was 7,523,821yen per QALY. The cost-effectiveness probability of TAVI was 60% 
for inoperable patients and 46% for operable patients. Among inoperable 
patients, the cost-effective threshold of TAVI was <7,759,085yen. Among operable 
patients, the cost-effective threshold of TAVI was <5,427,439yen.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TAVI has good cost effectiveness for 
inoperable patients, but not for operable patients.
