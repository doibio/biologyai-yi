index (P < 0.001). Significant difference was confirmed between incidences for 
disease based on the results of OGTT and glycated haemoglobin test when two 
different criteria systems were used. Age was the strongest predictor of 
pre-diabetes/diabetes (P = 0.016). The presence of metabolic syndrome increased 
the level of glycated haemoglobin by an average of 0.2% in normal glycemic 
status.

BACKGROUND: People with enduring mental illness (EMI) have higher morbidity and 
mortality from chronic diseases than the general population, and this results in 
a signiﬁcantly reduced relative life expectancy-accounted for primarily by 
physical illness. This gap may be partly influenced by the reduced likelihood of 
access to and uptake of regular physical health screening.
AIM: To establish Irish service providers' perspectives regarding the care of 
the physical health of people with EMI in an effort to inform future service 
developments aimed at improving the physical health of people with EMI.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study of healthcare providers-general 
practitioners (GPs) and members of the community mental health teams-in Ireland.
PARTICIPANTS: GPs and mental health service providers.
METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 service 
providers. Thematic analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: Participants considered that the physical health of people with EMI is 
not currently regularly addressed by the patient's GP or the mental health team. 
Factors associated with this include patient compliance with attendance, time 
constraints in consultations to adequately support patient self-management, 
communication difficulties with the patient and between primary and secondary 
care, and lack of clarity as to whose responsibility it is to ensure physical 
health is monitored. In participants' view, a barrier to improvement is the 
present funding approach.
CONCLUSION: The evidence from this study has the potential to form the basis for 
innovation and change in service delivery for people with an EMI in Ireland and 
internationally, specifically in countries where it is not clear who has the 
overall responsibility to monitor the physical health of patients with EMI. This 
role requires time and regular contact, and both the organisation and the 
funding of the health system need to support it.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy has brought about a higher 
prevalence of chronic illnesses among older people.
OBJECTIVES: To identify common chronic illnesses among older adults, to examine 
the influence of such conditions on their Health-Related Quality of Life 
(HRQoL), and to determine factors predicting their HRQoL.
METHOD: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving 377 
individuals aged 60 years and above who were selected using multi-stage sampling 
techniques in Olorunda Local Government, Osun State, Nigeria. Data were 
collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire comprising 
socio-demographic characteristics, chronic illnesses, and the World Health 
Organization quality of life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) containing physical 
health, psychological, social relationships, and environmental domains.
RESULTS: About half (51.5%) of the respondents reported at least one chronic 
illness which has lasted for 1-5 years (43.3%). The prevalence of hypertension 
was 36.1%, diabetes 13.9% and arthritis 13.4%. Respondents with chronic illness 
had significantly lower HRQoL overall and in the physical health, social 
relationships and the environmental domains (all p<0.05) compared to those 
without a chronic illness. Factors that predicted HRQoL include age, marital 
status, level of education, the presence of chronic illness and prognosis of the 
condition.
CONCLUSION: This study concluded that chronic illness is prevalent in Nigerian 
older people and significantly influence their HRQoL. Age, marital status, and 
level of education were associated with HRQoL in this group.

Dementia is the major predictor of death in old age. The aim of this paper was 
to determine whether 8-year mortality among 85-year olds with and without 
dementia, and if the contribution of dementia to mortality relative to other 
common diseases has changed. We used two population-based cohorts of 
85-year-olds (N = 1065), born in 1901-02 and 1923-24, which were examined with 
identical methods in 1986-87 and 2008-2010 and followed for 8-year mortality 
according to data from the Swedish Tax Agency. Dementia was diagnosed according 
to DSM-III-R. Other diseases were diagnosed based on self-reports, close 
informant interviews, somatic examinations, and the Swedish National In-patient 
Register. Compared to cohort 1901-02, cohort 1923-24 had a lower 8-year 
mortality both among those with (HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.99) and without dementia 
(HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Dementia was associated with increased mortality in 
both cohorts (cohort 1901-02, HR 2.6; 95% CI 2.0-3.2, cohort 1923-24, HR 2.8; 
95% CI 2.3-3.5), and remained the major predictor of death, with a population 
attributable risk of 31.7% in 1986-87 and 27.7% in 2008-10. Dementia remained 
the most important predictor of death in both cohorts. The relative risk for 
mortality with dementia did not change between cohorts, despite a decreased 
mortality rate in the population.

Estimating optimal willingness to pay thresholds for cost-effectiveness 
analysis: A generalized method.

Phelps CE(1), Cinatl C(2).

Operationalizing cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) requires that decisionmakers 
select maximum willingness to pay thresholds (K). We generalize previous methods 
used to estimate K using highly flexible hyperbolic absolute risk aversion 
(HARA) utility functions that encompass a wide range of risk behavior. For HARA 
utility, we calculate formulas for relative risk aversion (r*) and relative 
prudence (π∗ ), using literature-based estimates to calibrate our HARA model. We 
then assess optimal WTP thresholds (K) in absolute value and relative to income 
(K/M). Across the most-plausible range of risk preference parameters (r* and π∗ 
), optimal K/M ratios sit (approximately) in the range of 1 to 3, although we 
cannot readily rule out larger K/M values. The optimal K always increases with 
income, while K/M falls with income if utility has increasing relative risk 
aversion. Results of this more-general model of economic utility are broadly 
consistent with previous work using more-restrictive Weibull functions. More 
precision in measuring the key parameters-particularly relative prudence (π∗ ) 
will narrow down the range of K/M estimates. The highly general HARA structure 
illuminates why and how optimal CEA thresholds change with income. An appendix 
illuminates how relative risk aversion and relative prudence relate to each 
other.

Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, USA.

The life expectancy of patients with end-stage heart disease undergoing 
Orthotopic Heart Transplantation (OHT) has increased significantly in the recent 
decades since its original introduction into the medical practice in 1967. 
Substantial advances in post-operative intensive care, surgical prophylaxis, and 
anti-rejection drugs have clearly impacted survivability after OHT, therefore 
the volume of patients presenting for non-cardiac surgical procedures is 
expected to continue to escalate in the upcoming years. There are a number of 
caveats associated with this upsurge of post-OHT patients requiring non-cardiac 
surgery, including presenting to healthcare facilities without the resources and 
technology necessary to manage potential perioperative complications or that may 
not be familiar with the care of these patients, facilities in which a cardiac 
anesthesiologist is not available, patients presenting for emergency procedures 
and so forth. The perioperative care of patients after OHT introduces several 
challenges to the anesthesiologist including preoperative risk assessments 
different to the general population and intraoperative management of a 
denervated organ with altered response to medications and drug-drug 
interactions. The present review aims to synopsize current data of patients 
presenting for non-cardiac surgery after OHT, surgical aspects of the transplant 
that may impact perioperative care, physiology of the transplanted heart as well 
as anesthetic considerations.

aestivum (Poales: Poaceae) and Population Growth of Rhopalosiphum padi 
(Hemiptera: Aphididae).

To ascertain the direct effects of water stress upon wheat plants (Triticum 
aestivum L.) and how these effects, in turn, influence the population growth of 
the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.), we conducted a physiological 
analysis of wheat seedlings grown under three different watering regimes and 
subsequently determined the population parameters of the aphid using the 
age-stage, two-sex life table. A significantly higher content of free amino 
acids and soluble sugars were observed in wheat seedlings exposed to drought 
stress compared to seedlings that were well-watered and those that were grown 
under waterlogged conditions. Extended phloem salivation and stylet penetration 
with shorter duration of sustained ingestion from phloem was observed in an 
electrical penetration graph (EPG) of R. padi on drought-stressed wheat 
seedlings. This suggested that the aphid's feeding activity, as well as nutrient 
intake, were impeded. The significantly higher percentage of essential amino 
acids found in wheat seedlings grown under waterlogged conditions promoted 
significantly higher fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase in R. padi 
populations compared to aphids fed on drought-treated or well-watered wheat 
seedlings. Our findings suggest that wheat seedling responses to water stress 
involve changes in sap composition that are responsible for altering the aphids' 
nutrient intake and consequently affect their population growth. From a grower's 
perspective, extending wheat cultivation in a rice-wheat rotation paddy field 
during the winter season may not be economically profitable if the fields are 
chronically waterlogged, since this may potentially lead to a higher infestation 
of cereal aphids.

A local sphenoid mucosal flap (SMF) is naturally raised during endonasal 
exposure of the sella. Typically, these flaps are repositioned; however, they 
could be used in place of a nasoseptal flap (NSF) for closure of low-grade CSF 
leaks. In this study, we aim to establish the safety and efficacy of SMF closure 
for low-grade CSF leaks and to assess the impact on sinonasal quality of life 
(QoL) compared to NSF closure. In a consecutive, prospective cohort of anterior 
skull base pathology, data regarding sellar and suprasellar extension (Hardy 
grade), cavernous sinus invasion (Knosp grade), intraoperative (Kelly grade) and 
postoperative CSF leak, and sino-nasal QoL data (SNOT-22) were analysed. Of 187 
patients with no/low flow (Kelly 0-1) intraoperative CSF leak, 127 (67.9%) 
received a SMF and 60 (32.1%) received a NSF. A total of 141/187 (75.4%) had 
no intraoperative leak, while 46/187 (24.6%) had grade-1 leaks. SMF were used in 
70.9% (100/141) of cases without intraoperative leak, and 58.7% (27/46) of cases 
with Kelly grade-1 leaks. Hardy grade 4, grade E and Knosp grade 4 lesions were 
all more commonly closed with a NSF (p < 0.05). Two patients (1.1%) had 
postoperative CSF leaks, both in the SMF group, and both after no 
discernible intraoperative leak. Sinonasal QoL was below baseline for up to 
3 months postoperatively. SMF cases tended to have better sinonasal QoL for up 
to 6 weeks after surgery. Thus, in the largest cohort to date, SMF are a safe 
alternative to NSF for closure low-grade skull base defects. Sinonasal QoL was 
better in the first 6 weeks after SMF closure than NSF closure.

TTP is a life-threatening disorder with limited pharmaceutical treatment 
options. Recently, the potential of streptokinase in the treatment of acquired 
TTP was demonstrated in humans in vitro, and in vivo in a mouse model. We aimed 
to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of streptokinase in an established 
Papio ursinus model of acquired TTP. In vitro: VWF activities & multimer 
patterns and thromboelastograms were assessed with increasing concentrations of 
streptokinase. In vivo: After induction of TTP, escalating streptokinase doses 
(ranging from 50,000 to 900,000 IU) were administered, and the effects of 
streptokinase assessed on peripheral blood counts, fibrinolysis, VWF activities 
& multimer patterns and thromboelastograms. In an extension of the study, 
high-dose streptokinase (1,500,000-3,000,000 IU) was administered to another 
baboon. After spiking, fibrinolysis with loss of large VWF multimers was 
observed at [2200 IU/mL]-roughly equivalent to 1,500,000 IU. However, 
administration of escalating intravenous streptokinase doses had no in vivo 
effect on the TTP phenotype, and in vivo increases in plasmin activity were mild 
when compared with baseline, even at high doses. Minimal effect on VWF multimer 
patterns was observed but only at doses ≥ 1500,000 IU. Streptokinase is not 
effective in resolving TTP in a Papio ursinus model of TTP, possibly due to 
limited activation of the baboon fibrinolytic system. Modifications to this 
model, the use of alternative higher animal models, or alternative 
thrombolytics, should be considered to establish proof-of-concept.

INTRODUCTION: Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is proposed to treat refractory 
chronic cluster headache (rCCH), but its cost-effectiveness has not been 
evaluated, limiting its diffusion and reimbursement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a before-and-after economic study, from data 
collected prospectively in a nation-wide registry. We compared the 
cost-effectiveness of ONS associated with conventional treatment (intervention 
and postintervention period) to conventional treatment alone (preintervention 
period) in the same patients. The analysis was conducted on 76 rCCH patients 
from the French healthcare perspective at three months, then one year by 
extrapolation. Because of the impact of the disease on patient activity, 
indirect cost, such as sick leave and disability leave, was assessed second.
RESULTS: The average total cost for three months was €7602 higher for the ONS 
strategy compared to conventional strategy with a gain of 0.07 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was then 
€109,676/QALY gained. The average extrapolated total cost for one year was €1344 
lower for the ONS strategy (p = 0.5444) with a gain of 0.28 QALY (p < 0.0001), 
the ICER was then €-4846/QALY gained. The scatter plot of the probabilistic 
bootstrapping had 80% of the replications in the bottom right-hand quadrant, 
indicating that the ONS strategy is dominant. The average indirect cost for 
three months was €377 lower for the ONS strategy (p = 0.1261).
DISCUSSION: This ONS cost-effectiveness study highlighted the limitations of a 
short-time horizon in an economic study that may lead the healthcare authorities 
to reject an innovative strategy, which is actually cost-effective. One-year 
extrapolation was the proposed solution to obtain results on which healthcare 
authorities can base their decisions.
CONCLUSION: Considering the burden of rCCH and the efficacy and safety of ONS, 
the demonstration that ONS is dominant should help its diffusion, validation, 
and reimbursement by health authorities in this severely disabled population.

Preventing age-dependent neurodegeneration is a compelling yet elusive goal for 
neuroscientists, clinicians, affected individuals and their caregivers. As life 
expectancy increases and the global population ages, the burden of illness 
soars. A critical examination of what scientific areas require a fresh look is 
motivated by the growing magnitude of the health problem as well as by the 
numerous failed trials of agents once considered worth the investment of 
clinical trial resources in Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. In so 
many of these cases it has become clear that the disease is more complicated 
than previously thought and that fatal flaws stemmed from assumptions based on 
imperfect or incomplete information from animal models. Renewed optimism that 
science will be able to provide relief derives from new knowledge that comes on 
a regular basis from bright, dedicated basic scientists. Lessons have been 
learned from failed experiments in the laboratory and clinic, and new tools are 
now available which allow questions to be addressed that were previously out of 
our reach. By casting a wide net that tries to envelop the entire scope of the 
problem, this chapter considers the scientific gaps that stand in the way of 
effective treatments for neurodegeneration. Discoveries that present tantalizing 
therapeutic hypotheses are viewed as pieces of a puzzle so that the “magic” is 
stripped from the search for a “magic pill.” At its core, neurodegeneration is a 
problem of cell health. Importantly, cells are interrelated within the brain, 
and thus limiting study to one type of cell is a flawed strategy. 
Neurodegenerative diseases must be considered as disorders of nervous system 
circuits. Patients’ symptoms are the manifestations of neural circuit 
dysfunction. Accordingly, a successful treatment needs (a) to normalize the 
biology within individual cells as well as within the tissue and (b) to preserve 
or repair the information processing in important neural circuits. This approach 
places new biologic discoveries in perspective and promotes discussion of gaps 
that stand between discoveries and knowledge of neurodegeneration in overall 
tissues and circuit dysfunction that eventuates clinically.

902. Preclinical and Clinical Understanding: Major Gaps in Our Understanding and 
Capabilities.

Therapies [Internet]. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press; 2015. Chapter 6.

Age-associated diseases are an inevitable, costly, and burdensome outcome to 
societies as life expectancy increases. All countries face this growing problem 
even as there are notable successes in treating some of these diseases. For 
example, effective control of hypertension has been accompanied by a noteworthy 
reduction in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, the same 
cannot be said for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, 
motor neuron, and Huntington diseases, despite the tremendous recent progress 
that has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of this group of 
brain disorders. Currently there is no effective treatment that delays the onset 
or slows the natural progression of these diseases. Even the very effective 
pharmacologic and surgical therapies for Parkinson disease are directed solely 
at motor symptoms; neither the nonmotor symptoms nor the gradual deterioration 
can be effectively treated or prevented. This chapter discusses some of the 
difficulties faced in discovering and developing effective treatments for these 
diseases, from both the preclinical and clinical perspectives. Some of the gaps 
in our knowledge and critical questions that must be addressed in the near 
future are described, with an emphasis on Alzheimer disease. The challenges are 
many and include incomplete understanding of disease pathophysiology, 
deficiencies in animal models, and inefficiencies in translating new genetic, 
molecular, cellular, and neurobiological insights into the clinical arena. There 
is increasing consensus that treatments which target the potential disease 
triggers will likely be more effective when given before the onset of clinical 
symptoms. This, however, brings additional challenges—from the need for new 
biomarkers to improvements in the design and execution of clinical trials—which 
the research community must quickly address.

BACKGROUND: Although outcome studies generally demonstrate the superiority of a 
total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) over a hemiarthroplasty (HA), comparative 
cost-effectiveness has not been well studied. From a publicly funded health-care 
system's perspective, this study compared the costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) in patients who underwent TSA with those in patients who 
underwent HA.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a Markov model to simulate 
the costs and QALYs for patients undergoing either TSA or HA over a lifetime 
horizon to account for costs and medically important events over the patient 
lifetime. Subgroup analyses by age groups (≤50 or >50 years) were performed. A 
series of sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of study 
findings. The results were presented in 2019 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: TSA was dominant as it was less costly ($115,785 compared with 
$118,501) and more effective (10.21 compared with 8.47 QALYs) than HA over a 
lifetime horizon. Changes to health utility values after TSA and HA had the 
largest impact on the cost-effectiveness findings. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained, HA was not found to be cost-effective. The 
probability that TSA was cost-effective was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a WTP of $50,000 per QALY gained, from the perspective of 
Canada's publicly funded health-care system, TSA was found to be cost-effective 
in all patients, including those ≤50 years of age, compared with HA.

Neurological diseases are estimated to affect 1 billion people worldwide and are 
the cause of one in 10 deaths. In Brazil, they are responsible for approximately 
14% of clinical admissions to intensive care units, 9% of elective 
neurosurgeries and 14% of emergency neurosurgeries. Many of these conditions are 
incurable, result in reduced life expectancy and quality of life and increased 
dependence, and are associated with symptoms that are likely to cause suffering, 
which justifies the integration of palliative care into usual care. In addition, 
factors unique to acute neurological injuries, such as their catastrophic 
clinical presentation, complex and uncertain prognosis, associated communication 
difficulties and issues related to quality of life, require a specific approach, 
which has recently been termed "neuropalliative care". Although the topic is 
relevant and current, it is still little discussed, and much of what is known 
about palliative care in this context is extrapolated from approaches used under 
other conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to conduct a 
narrative literature review to identify the challenges of applying the 
palliative care approach in the care of neurocritically ill patients, with a 
focus on three groups: neurocritically ill patients, families and intensive care 
teams. This review identified that in intensive care, the main demands for 
palliative care are for prognostic definitions and care planning. Training in 
primary palliative care and improving communication were also needs identified 
by intensivists and families, respectively. In contrast with what has been found 
under other conditions, the management of symptoms was not indicated as a 
complex issue, although it is still relevant.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role of the Vulnerable Elders Survey to 
identify older adults with limited life expectancy in primary healthcare 
settings.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study was performed in all (nine) healthcare units 
in Jatai, Goiás (Brazil) from July to December 2018. A sample size of 407 older 
adults was obtained considering an older population (≥ 60 years old). 
Participants answered a questionnaire about sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics, including the Vulnerable Elders Survey and the Suemoto index. 
We tested the association between limited life expectancy and the Vulnerable 
Elders Survey using multiple logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The mean age was 68.9 ± 6.6 yo, and 58.0% were women. The mean score of 
the Vulnerable Elders Survey was 2.0 ± 2.2, the mean score of Suemoto index was 
31.5 ± 21.1%, and 17.2% had limited life expectancy. The Vulnerable Elders 
Survey was associated with limited life expectancy (OR = 1.57; p = < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The Vulnerable Elders Survey was able to identify older adults with 
limited life expectancy in primary healthcare settings and can play a role in 
detecting older adults who would not benefit from screening and strict control 
of chronic diseases.

Corticospinal excitability in humans can be facilitated during imagination 
and/or observation of upper-limb motor tasks. However, it remains unclear to 
what extent facilitation levels may differ from those elicited during execution 
of the same tasks. Twelve able-bodied individuals were recruited in this study. 
Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and flexor carpi 
radialis (FCR) muscles were elicited through transcranial magnetic stimulation 
of the primary motor cortex during: (i) rest; (ii) wrist extension; and (iii) 
wrist flexion. Responses were compared between: (1) motor imagery combined with 
virtual action observation (MI + AO; first-person virtual wrist movements shown 
on a computer display, while participants remained at rest and imagined these 
movements); and (2) motor execution (ME; participants extended or flexed their 
wrist). During MI + AO, ECR MEPs were facilitated during the extension phase but 
not the flexion phase, while FCR MEPs were facilitated during the flexion phase 
but not extension phase, compared to rest. During the ME condition, same, but 
greater, modulations were shown as those during MI + AO, while background muscle 
activities were similar in the rest phase as during extension and flexion phase 
in the MI + AO condition. Our results demonstrated that kinesthetic MI that 
included imagination and observation of virtual hands can elicit phase-dependent 
muscles-specific corticospinal facilitation of wrist muscles, consistent to 
those during actual hand extension and flexion. Moreover, we showed that MI + AO 
can contribute considerably to the overall corticospinal facilitation (∼20 % of 
ME) even without muscle contractions. These findings support utility of computer 
graphics-based motor imagery, which may have implications for rehabilitation and 
development of brain-computer interfaces.

INTRODUCTION: In older US nursing home (NH) residents, there is limited research 
on the prevalence of physical frailty, its potential dynamic changes, and its 
association with cognitive impairment in older adults' first 6 months of NH 
stay.
METHODS: Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 is the national database on residents in US 
Medicare-/Medicaid-certified NHs. MDS 3.0 was used to identify older adults aged 
≥65 years, newly admitted to NHs during January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2016, with 
life expectancy ≥6 months at admission and NH length of stay ≥6 months (N = 
571,139). MDS 3.0 assessments at admission, 3 months, and 6 months were used. In 
each assessment, physical frailty was measured by FRAIL-NH (robust, prefrail, 
and frail) and cognitive impairment by Brief Interview for Mental Status and 
Cognitive Performance Scale (none/mild, moderate, and severe). Demographic 
characteristics and diagnosed conditions were measured at admission, while 
presence of pain and receipt of psychotropic medications were at each 
assessment. Distribution of physical frailty and its change over time by 
cognitive impairment were described. A nonproportional odds model was fitted 
with a generalized estimation equation to longitudinally examine the association 
between physical frailty and cognitive impairment, adjusting for demographic and 
clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Around 60% of older residents were physically frail in the first 6 
months. Improvement and worsening across physical frailty levels were observed. 
Particularly, in those who were prefrail at admission, 23% improved to robust by 
3 months. At admission, 3 months, and 6 months, over 37% of older residents had 
severe cognitive impairment and about 70% of those with cognitive impairment 
were physically frail. At admission, older residents with moderate cognitive 
impairment were 35% more likely (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.35, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.33-1.37) and those with severe impairment were 74% more likely 
(aOR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.72-1.77) to be frail than prefrail/robust, compared to 
those with none/mild impairment. The association between the 2 conditions 
remained positive and consistently increased over time.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Physical frailty was prevalent in NHs with potential to 
improve and was strongly associated with cognitive impairment. Physical frailty 
could be a modifiable target, and interventions may include efforts to address 
cognitive impairment.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a stratified cost-utility analysis of total versus partial 
hip arthroplasty as a function of clinical subtype.
METHOD: All cases of this type of intervention were analysed between 2010 and 
2016 in the Basque Health Service, gathering data on clinical outcomes and 
resource use to calculate the cost and utility in quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) at individual level. The statistical analysis included applying the 
propensity score to balance the groups, and seemingly unrelated regression 
models to calculate the incremental cost-utility ratio and plot the 
cost-effectiveness plane. The interaction between age group and American Society 
of Anesthesiologists (ASA) risk class was assessed in the multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: The study identified 5867 patients diagnosed with femoral neck 
fracture, of whom 1307 and 4560 were treated with total and partial hip 
arthroplasty, respectively. In the cost-utility analysis based on the seemingly 
unrelated regression, total hip arthroplasty was found to have a higher cost and 
higher utility (2465€ and 0.42 QALYs). Considering a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €22,000 per QALY, total hip arthroplasty was cost-effective in the 
under-80-year-old subgroup. Among patients above this age, hemiarthroplasty was 
cost-effective in ASA class I-II patients and dominant in ASA class III-IV 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Subgroup analysis supports current daily clinical practice in 
displaced femoral neck fractures, namely, using partial replacement in most 
patients and reserving total replacement for younger patients.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies show that digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) 
combined with digital mammography (DM) can reduce recall rates and increases 
rates of breast cancer detection. The objective of this study was to examine the 
cost-effectiveness of DBT plus DM versus DM alone in British Columbia and to 
identify parameters that can improve the efficiency of breast cancer screening 
programs.
METHODS: We conducted an economic analysis based on data from a cohort of 
screening participants in the BC Cancer Breast Screening Program. The decision
