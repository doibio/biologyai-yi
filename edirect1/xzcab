PURPOSE: Oat β-glucan reduces cholesterol levels and thus reduces the risk for 
coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its economic impact has not been well 
studied. We examined the economic impact of daily intake of ≥3 g of oat β-glucan 
in primary prevention of CHD in patients receiving statins or no pharmacologic 
treatment.
METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare costs and outcomes associated 
with lowering cholesterol levels with no pharmacologic treatment and normal 
diet, no pharmacologic treatment plus ≥3 g/d of oat β-glucan, and statin therapy 
plus ≥3 g/d of oat β-glucan. The population comprised men 45, 55, or 65 years of 
age with no history of cardiovascular disease and a 10-year risk for CHD of 5%, 
7.5%, or 10%. Clinical efficacy data were gathered from meta-analyses; safety 
data, costs, and utilities were gathered from published literature. Cost per 
quality-adjusted life years and number of first events were reported.
FINDINGS: Maintaining ≥3 g/d of β-glucan may be cost-effective in men aged 45, 
55, and 65 years with 10-year CHD risks of 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0% taking no 
pharmacologic treatment or on statins. It may also reduce first events of 
myocardial infarction and CHD death. Results are sensitive to oat β-glucan cost 
but insensitive to changes in other parameters. Maintaining ≥3 g of oat β-glucan 
daily remains cost-effective within plausible range of values.
IMPLICATIONS: β-glucan may be cost-effective for preventing CHD events in 
middle-aged men with no history of cardiovascular events whose 10-year CHD risk 
is ≥5%. Maintaining daily β-glucan intake may have considerable impact on first 
events.

Percutaneous Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage in Atrial Fibrillation, Second 
Thoughts?

Wagdi P(1), Salzer F(1).

Life expectancy of the population is steadily increasing world wide. 
Consequently, the incidence and ultimately the prevalence of atrial fibrillation 
(AF) and it's sequelae will be rising proportionately. It is estimated that 3-5% 
of persons above 65 years of age have chronic AF, 30% of which will suffer at 
least one stroke. On the other hand, chronic AF is responsible for about 20% of 
all cerebrovascular accidents. Predictors of stroke in AF have been defined by 
the CHADS2 score, and in these patients, oral anticoagulation has been the 
cornerstone of thromboembolic disease prevention. Because elderly patients have 
an increased risk of bleeding complications even under the newer antagonists of 
Factor Xa and direct Thrombin inhibitors, percutaneous occlusion of the left 
atrial appendage (LAA) as the main thrombogenic source offers an attractive 
alternative to permanent anticoagulation. This promising new therapeutic 
approach is put into clinical real world perspective.

Minimizing Stress Shielding and Cement Damage in Cemented Femoral Component of a 
Hip Prosthesis through Computational Design Optimization.

Edmond, OK, USA.

The average life expectancy of many people undergoing total hip replacement 
(THR) exceeds twenty-five years and the demand for implants that increase the 
load-bearing capability of the bone without affecting the short- or long-term 
stability of the prosthesis is high. Mechanical failure owing to cement damage 
and stress shielding of the bone are the main factors affecting the long-term 
survival of cemented hip prostheses and implant design must realistically adjust 
to balance between these two conflicting effects. In the following analysis we 
introduce a novel methodology to achieve this objective, the numerical technique 
combines automatic and realistic modeling of the implant and embedding medium, 
and finite element analysis to assess the levels of stress shielding and cement 
damage and, finally, global optimization, using orthogonal arrays and 
probabilistic restarts, were used. Applications to implants, fabricated using a 
homogeneous material and a functionally graded material, were presented.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment with IDegLira has the potential to improve glycemic 
control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without the weight gain 
and with a lower risk of hypoglycemia than with other therapies. The aim of the 
present analysis was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira 
versus insulin glargine U100 with re-education and up-titration of the dose for 
treatment of patients with T2DM failing to achieve glycemic control on basal 
insulin in the US setting.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the DUAL V randomized controlled trial in which 
adults with T2DM failing to achieve glycemic targets with insulin glargine U100 
were randomly allocated to receive either IDegLira or insulin glargine U100. 
Long-term projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs were made using the 
IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Costs were accounted from a healthcare payer 
perspective. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with improved discounted life expectancy (13.99 
[standard deviation 0.19] versus 13.82 [standard deviation 0.20] years) and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.14 [standard deviation 0.12] versus 8.87 
[standard deviation 0.13] quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) compared to 
insulin glargine U100. IDegLira was associated with increased direct costs of 
$16,970, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $63,678 per 
QALY gained versus insulin glargine U100. Sensitivity analyses identified that 
the key driver of cost-effectiveness was the greater reduction in glycated 
hemoglobin with IDegLira compared with insulin glargine U100.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on head-to-head clinical trial data, the present analysis 
suggests that IDegLira is likely to improve long-term clinical outcomes for 
patients with T2DM not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin compared to 
re-education and up-titration of the dose of insulin glargine U100, with these 
improvements coming at an increased cost from a healthcare payer perspective. An 
ICER within the range described as high care value was calculated, suggesting 
IDegLira is a cost-effective treatment option in the US.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify whether perceived swallowing 
problems affect the life expectancy of very elderly individuals.
BACKGROUND: In an ageing society, oral function affects health status. In 
particular, a decline in swallowing function may increase the risk of various 
diseases, morbidity and malnutrition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 526 elderly individuals aged ≥85 years. All 
participants completed a questionnaire and underwent oral, physical and mental 
health examinations. The comprehensive oral health assessment comprised a 
face-to-face interview that included a questionnaire on swallowing function. We 
estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using the Cox proportional 
hazards model, adjusting for potential confounders between perceived swallowing 
problems and all-cause mortality over a 3-year period.
RESULTS: Over a 3-year follow-up period, 88 of 526 participants died and 68 
participants complained of perceived swallowing problems. Perceived swallowing 
problems had statistically significant associations with physical status and 
function and nutrition. In the univariate analysis, perceived swallowing 
problems had statistically significant associations with an approximately 
1.9-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality during the 3-year period (HR: 1.89, 
95% CI: 1.14-3.14). In the multivariate analysis, the statistically significant 
association between perceived swallowing problems and all-cause mortality 
remained after adjusting for various confounding factors (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 
1.03-2.92).
CONCLUSION: Perceived swallowing disorders should be verified by a clinical 
examination, as they are associated with other health outcomes and increased 
all-cause mortality.

Royal Darwinian Demons: Enforced Changes in Reproductive Efforts Do Not Affect 
the Life Expectancy of Ant Queens.

Schrempf A, Giehr J, Röhrl R, Steigleder S, Heinze J.

One of the central tenets of life-history theory is that organisms cannot 
simultaneously maximize all fitness components. This results in the fundamental 
trade-off between reproduction and life span known from numerous animals, 
including humans. Social insects are a well-known exception to this rule: 
reproductive queens outlive nonreproductive workers. Here, we take a step 
forward and show that under identical social and environmental conditions the 
fecundity-longevity trade-off is absent also within the queen caste. A change in 
reproduction did not alter life expectancy, and even a strong enforced increase 
in reproductive efforts did not reduce residual life span. Generally, egg-laying 
rate and life span were positively correlated. Queens of perennial social 
insects thus seem to maximize at the same time two fitness parameters that are 
normally negatively correlated. Even though they are not immortal, they best 
approach a hypothetical "Darwinian demon" in the animal kingdom.

BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges in traumatic amputation is the need to 
keep ischemia time brief (4 to 6 hours) to avoid ischemic damage and enable 
successful replantation. The current inability to meet this challenge often 
leads to traumatic limb loss, which has a considerable detrimental impact on the 
quality of life of patients.
METHODS: The authors' team built a portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenator 
device for the perfusion of amputated extremities with oxygenated acellular 
solution under controlled parameters. The authors amputated forelimbs of 
Yorkshire pigs, perfused them ex vivo with acellular Perfadex solution for 12 
hours at 10°C in their device, and subsequently replanted them into the host 
animal. The authors used limbs stored on ice slurry for 4 hours before 
replantation as their control group.
RESULTS: Clinical observation and histopathologic evaluation both demonstrated 
that there was less morbidity and less tissue damage to the cells during 
preservation and after replantation in the perfusion group compared with the 
standard of care. Significant differences in blood markers of muscle damage and 
tissue cytokine levels underscored these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated the feasibility and superiority of ex vivo 
hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion for preservation of amputated limbs 
over conventional static cold storage and herewith a substantial extension of 
the allowable ischemia time for replantation after traumatic amputation. This 
approach could also be applied to the field of transplantation, expanding the 
potential pool of viable donor vascularized composite allografts.

BACKGROUND: As publically promoted by all stakeholders in health care reform, 
prospective outcomes registry platforms lie at the center of all current 
evidence-driven value-based models.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the variability in outcomes and cost at population 
level and individual patient level for patients undergoing spine surgery for 
degenerative diseases.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospective longitudinal spine registry data 
was conducted. Baseline and postoperative 1-year patient-reported outcomes were 
recorded. Previously published minimal clinically important difference for 
Oswestry Disability Index (14.9) was used. Back-related resource utilization and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed. Variations in outcomes and 
cost were analyzed at population level and at the individual patient level.
RESULTS: A total of 1454 patients were analyzed. There was significant 
improvement in patient-reported outcomes at postoperative 1 year ( P < .0001). 
For patients demonstrating health benefit at population level, 12.5%, n = 182 of 
patients experienced no gain from surgery and 38%, n = 554 failed to achieve 
minimal clinically important difference. Mean 1-year QALY-gained was 0.29; 18% 
of patients failed to report gain in QALY. For patients with 2-year follow-up, 
surgery resulted in 0.62 QALY-gained at average direct cost of $28 953. A wide 
variation in both QALY-gained and cost was observed.
CONCLUSION: Spine treatments that on average are cost-effective may have wide 
variability in value at the individual patient level. The variability 
demonstrated here represents an opportunity, through registries, to identify 
specific care that may be less effective, and refine patient-specific care 
delivery and indications to drive overall group-level treatment value. 
Understanding value of spine care at an individualized as well as population 
level will allow clinicians, and eventually payers, to better target resources 
for improving care for nonresponders, ultimately driving up the average health 
for the whole population.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is classified in 
many ways. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies the 
cancer based on patient's life expectancy. People with very early- or 
early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma have single tumour or three tumours of 
maximum diameter of 3 cm or less, Child-Pugh status A to B, and performance 
status 0 (fully functional). Management of hepatocellular carcinoma is 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different 
interventions used in the treatment of early or very early hepatocellular 
carcinoma through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the 
available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was 
not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar 
across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network 
meta-analysis and instead assessed the benefits and harms of different 
interventions versus each other or versus sham or no intervention using standard 
Cochrane methodology.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index 
Expanded, and trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical 
trials (RCTs) on hepatocellular carcinoma.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, 
or publication status, in participants with very early- or early-stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, portal 
hypertension, aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, size and number of the 
tumours, and future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials including 
participants who were previously liver transplanted. We considered interventions 
compared with each other, sham, or no intervention.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We calculated the odds ratio, mean difference, 
rate ratio, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both 
fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis 
with Review Manager 5. We assessed the risk of bias according to Cochrane, 
controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and 
the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four 
trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) 
compared surgery versus radiofrequency ablation in people with early 
hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery. Fourteen trials (2533 
participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared 
different non-surgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular 
carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Overall, the quality of evidence was 
low or very low for all outcomes for both comparisons. Surgery versus 
radiofrequency ablationThe majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and 
the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. The trials did not report 
the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant 
antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow-up ranged from 
29 months to 42 months (3 trials).There was no evidence of a difference in 
all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up for surgery versus radiofrequency 
ablation (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.08; 574 
participants; 4 trials; I2 = 68). Cancer-related mortality was lower in the 
surgery group (20/115 (17.4%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (43/115 
(37.4%)) (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; 230 participants; 1 trial). 
Serious adverse events (number of participants) was higher in the surgery group 
(14/60 (23.3%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (1/60 (1.7%)) (odds 
ratio 17.96, 95% CI 2.28 to 141.60; 120 participants; 1 trial). The number of 
serious adverse events was higher in the surgery group (adjusted rate 11.3 
events per 100 participants) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (3/186 
(1.6 events per 100 participants)) (rate ratio 7.02, 95% CI 2.29 to 21.46; 391 
participants; 2 trials; I2 = 0%). None of the trials reported health-related 
quality of life. One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three 
trials were funded by parties without any vested. Non-surgical interventionsThe 
majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma 
was of viral aetiology. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension 
status of the participants, and none of the trials reported whether the 
participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. 
The average follow-up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (11 trials). Trial 
participants, who were not eligible for surgery, were treated with 
radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, microwave ablation, percutaneous acetic 
acid injection, percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of radiofrequency 
ablation with systemic chemotherapy, a combination of radiofrequency ablation 
with percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of transarterial 
chemoembolisation with percutaneous alcohol injection, or a combination of 
transarterial chemoembolisation with radiofrequency ablation.The mortality at 
maximal follow-up was higher in the percutaneous acetic acid injection (hazard 
ratio 1.77, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.79; 125 participants; 1 trial) and percutaneous 
alcohol injection (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88; 882 participants; 5 
trials; I2 = 57%) groups compared with the radiofrequency ablation group. There 
was no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up for 
any of the other comparisons. The proportion of people with cancer-related 
mortality at maximal follow-up was higher in the percutaneous alcohol injection 
group (adjusted proportion 16.8%) compared with the radiofrequency ablation 
group (20/232 (8.6%)) (odds ratio 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89; 458 participants; 3 
trials; I2 = 0%). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the 
comparisons that reported serious adverse events (number of participants or 
number of events). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. 
Five trials were funded by parties without any vested interest; the source of 
funding was not available in the remaining trials.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence was of low or very low quality. There was no 
evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up between 
surgery and radiofrequency ablation in people eligible for surgery. All-cause 
mortality at maximal follow-up was higher with percutaneous acetic acid 
injection and percutaneous alcohol injection than with radiofrequency ablation 
in people not eligible for surgery. There was no evidence of a difference in 
all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up for the other comparisons. High-quality 
RCTs designed to assess clinically important differences in all-cause mortality 
and health-related quality of life, and having an adequate follow-up period 
(approximately five years) are needed.

BACKGROUND: Regular blood transfusion and compliance with iron chelation therapy 
has markedly improved life expectancy in thalassemia; however, this improvement 
is accompanied by several complications of this chronic disease including 
thromboembolic disorders. The objective of this work is to study natural 
coagulation inhibition as well as the fibrinolysis processes in thalassemic 
children who are otherwise in a steady state with no overt clinical 
manifestations of thromboembolism.
METHODS: In a case-control study design conducted at Sohag University Hospital, 
Sohag, Egypt, 50 thalassemic children and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy 
controls were compared as regards prothrombin concentration, international 
normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time, protein C, protein S, 
antithrombin III, D-dimers, and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor 
(TAFI).
RESULTS: When compared to healthy controls, natural coagulation inhibitors 
(protein C, protein S, and antithrombin-III) were significantly lower in 
thalassemic children (p < 0.0001). While D-dimers showed a significant increase 
in thalassemic children, TAFI was significantly lower (p < 0.0001). 
Splenectomized thalassemic children showed significantly lower levels of protein 
C, protein S and TAFI (p < 0.001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively) when 
compared to nonsplenectomized thalassemic children.
CONCLUSION: Significant changes in natural coagulation inhibition and 
fibrinolysis processes favoring thromboembolism can be detected in otherwise 
healthy thalassemic children. Because these changes are more pronounced in 
splenectomized patients, study of primary prophylactic strategies in this 
subgroup is warranted.

Kanamycin sulphate (KS) is a Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein synthesis 
inhibitor. Due to its intense hydrophilicity, KS is cleared from the body within 
8 h. KS has a very short plasma half-life (2.5 h). KS is used in high 
concentrations to reach the therapeutic levels in plasma, which results in 
serious nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity. To overcome aforementioned limitations, the 
current study aimed to develop KS loaded PLGA-Vitamin-E-TPGS nanoparticles 
(KS-PLGA-TPGS NPs), to act as an efficient carrier for controlled delivery of 
KS. To achieve a substantial extension in blood circulation, a combined design, 
affixation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to KS-PLGA-TPGS NPs and adsorption of 
water-soluble chitosan (WSC) (cationic deacetylated chitin) to particle surface, 
was raised for surface modification of NPs. Surface modified NPs (KS-PEG-WSC 
NPs) were prepared to provide controlled delivery and circulate in the 
bloodstream for an extended period of time, thus minimizing dosing frequency. In 
vivo pharmacokinetics and in vivo biodistribution following intramuscular 
administration were investigated. NPs surface charge was close to neutral 
+3.61 mV and significantly affected by the WSC coating. KS-PEG-WSC NPs presented 
striking prolongation in blood circulation, reduced protein binding, and long 
drew-out the blood circulation half-life with resultant reduced kidney 
sequestration vis-à-vis KS-PLGA-TPGS NPs. The studies, therefore, indicate the 
successful formulation development of KS-PEG-WSC NPs with reduced frequency of 
dosing of KS indicating low incidence of nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity.

With increased life expectancy, people need more education about healthy aging. 
This paper examines older adult perceptions regarding various factors impacting 
longevity, including genetics, lifestyle, and the environment. Data were 
collected from 733 Hawai'i adults age 50 years and older (39% Caucasian, 27% 
Japanese, 19% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHOPI), 9% Chinese, and 7% 
Filipino) through randomized telephone interviews. Participants were asked to 
rate a variety of factors as having "great impact," "some impact," or "no 
impact" on lifespan. Regardless of ethnicity, more than half of the participants 
felt that eating habits, exercise, health information, health care, and the 
environment had great impact on lifespan. Less than half felt that economic 
status and community had great impact. Compared to the all ethnic groups, 
Filipino respondents were significantly less likely to feel that smoking (44%, 
compared with an average across all race/ethnicities of 64%) and stress (48%, 
average 62%) had great impact. Chinese participants were more likely to feel 
that drinking alcohol (64%) had great impact (average 38%). Filipinos and 
Chinese were more likely to perceive that working conditions have great impact 
(65% and 56%, respectively; average 45%), and NHOPI and Filipinos were more 
likely to perceive the natural environment as having great impact (59% and 54%, 
respectively; average 46%). Findings suggest that cultural values and 
experiences may shape older adults' perceptions of factors associated with 
lifespan, providing guidance for health professionals on how to tailor health 
messages to older adults in different ethnic groups.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer management involves a balance between the risks of 
cancer death against those from other causes. To evaluate the performance of 
several comorbidity indices in predicting comorbid death in a prostate cancer 
radiotherapy cohort.
METHODS: 2,131 men with localised prostate cancer treated with radical 
radiotherapy between 1999 and 2007 were studied. Tumour features, androgen 
deprivation usage, age, number of prescription medications (PMN) and Adult 
Comorbidity Evaluation-27 Index (ACE-27) were recorded. Death from prostate 
cancer (DPC) and death from other causes (DOC) were analysed as competing causes 
of death using a competing risks model, with discrimination assessed using the 
concordance index.
RESULTS: ACE-27 scores correlated with patient's PMN (median PMN = 2). Tumour 
features were independent of ACE-27 scores. Estimated cumulative incidences of 
DOC and DPC at 10 years were 16.4% and 7.7% respectively. In the 
low/intermediate risk group (n = 1026) there was a 3.4-fold predominance of DOC 
inside 10 years (cumulative incidence: 15.8% DOC vs 3.4% DPC). High-risk men had 
approximately equal rates of DPC and DOC at 10 years. Multivariable analysis 
showed age, ACE-27 score ≥ 1 and PMN to have significant associations with DOC 
(P < 0.002 for all). A multivariable model incorporating all 3 variables 
resulted in C-Index = 0.646.
CONCLUSION: Age, ACE-27 score and PMN act as independent prognostic factors for 
DOC in prostate cancer patients and can improve patient's life expectancy 
prediction.

For the evaluation of various adverse health effects of chemical elements 
occurring in the environment on humans, the comparison and linking of 
geochemical data (chemical composition of groundwater, soils, and dusts) with 
data on health status of population (so-called health indicators) play a key 
role. Geochemical and health data are predominantly nonlinear, and the use of 
standard statistical methods can lead to wrong conclusions. For linking such 
data, we find appropriate the use method of artificial neural networks (ANNs) 
which enable to eliminate data inhomogeneity and also potential data errors. 
Through method of ANNs, we are able to determine the order of influence of 
chemical elements on health indicators as well as to define limit values for the 
influential elements at which the health status of population is the most 
favourable (i.e. the lowest mortality, the highest life expectancy). For 
determination of dependence between the groundwater contents of chemical 
elements and health indicators, we recommend to create 200 ANNs. In further 
calculations performed for identification of order of influence of chemical 
elements as well as definition of limit values, we propose to work with median 
or mean values from calculated 200 ANNs. The ANN represents an appropriate 
method to be used for environmental and health data analysis in medical 
geochemistry.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of rapidly dissolving buprenorphine/naloxone 
sublingual tablets (BNX-RDT) in opioid-dependent patients.
METHODS: This open-label, 24-week extension study enrolled patients who 
completed primary trials of BNX-RDT. Daily tablet doses ranged from 5.7 to 
17.1 mg. The primary endpoint was safety; secondary assessments included opioid 
cravings, addiction severity, health-related quality of life (QOL), and 
workplace productivity at screening (final day of the primary trials) through 
study end, with changes measured from baseline of the primary trials.
RESULTS: In all, 665 patients received treatment; 292 (43.9%) completed the 
study. A total of 258 patients (38.8%) reported 557 treatment-emergent adverse 
events, most commonly headache (3.2%) and constipation (3.0%). Craving scores 
showed continued improvement on 100-mm visual analog scale (mean change from 
primary trial baseline, -52.8 at screening; mean change from extension trial 
baseline, -60.5 at week 24). Reductions in addiction severity from baseline of 
both the primary and extension trial were maintained through week 24 on multiple 
assessments, as were improvements in QOL on Short Form 36. Employment increased 
by 15% and mean (SD) hours worked per week increased by 4.6 (20.1) from baseline 
to study end. Mean (SD) scores for impact of opioid dependence on work 
productivity improved from 4.7 (3.0) at baseline to 0.9 (1.8) at study end 
(11-point scale).
CONCLUSIONS: Extended treatment with BNX-RDT demonstrated a safety profile 
similar to other BNX formulations, reduced opioid cravings, and improved both 
QOL and work productivity. Continued treatment may enable patients to advance in 
recovery and return to normal functioning.

Cochlear Implants Versus Hearing Aids in a Middle-Income Country: Costs, 
Productivity, and Quality of Life.

Colombia †Cochlear Implants Group, Hospital Universitario Fundación Santa Fe de 
Bogota, School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes ‡Postgraduate Program in 
Epidemiology, Center of Epidemiological Research, Universidade Federal de 
Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: In Colombia there are three main treatment approaches for bilateral 
profound sensorineural hearing loss, also known as profound deafness (PD): 
cochlear implants (CI), hearing aids (HA), and no treatment (NT). The objective 
of this study is to determine the optimal treatment approach for PD in terms of 
productivity and cost-effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN: Hearing levels and SES data were obtained from audiometric tests 
conducted on 100 patients with CI. For each treatment approach, productivity and 
cost-effectiveness assessments were estimated using influence diagrams and Monte 
Carlo simulations. Productivity was calculated as the net present value of a 
patient's lifetime income divided by total health-related and educational costs. 
For the CI and HA, the cost-effectiveness indicator was calculated as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained in comparison with the NT approach 
divided by the total cost of the treatment option.
RESULTS: The results for the CI, the HA, and NT in terms of productivity ratio 
were 1.53, 0.94, and 1.47, respectively. Patients using CI had a gain of 5.7 
QALYs, whereas patients using HA had a gain of 4.6 QALYs. The results for the CI 
and the HA in terms of cost-effectiveness were $15,169 and $15,430 per QALY, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The CI was found to be the optimal treatment for PD, as it was the 
most efficient and cost-effective in terms of improving patients' productivity 
and quality of life. We observed that children who had received CI developed 
hearing and speech abilities that contributed to their productivity and quality 
of life to a greater extent than those with HA.

Over the past 25 years, the average life expectancy for men has increased almost 
4 years, and the age of prostate cancer detection has decreased an average of 10 
years with diagnosis increasingly made at early-stage disease where curative 
therapy is possible. These changing trends in the age and extent of malignancy 
at diagnosis have revealed limitations in conventional curative therapies for 
prostate cancer, including a significant risk of aggressive cancer recurrence, 
and the risk of long-term genitourinary morbidity and its detrimental impact on 
patient's quality of life (QOL). Greater awareness of the shortcomings in 
radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and brachytherapy has prompted the 
search for alternative curative therapies that offer comparable rates of cancer 
control and less treatment-related morbidity to better preserve QOL. 
High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) possesses characteristics that make it 
an attractive curative therapy option. HIFU is a noninvasive approach that uses 
precisely delivered ultrasound energy to achieve tumor cell necrosis without 
radiation or surgical excision. In current urologic oncology, HIFU is used 
clinically in the treatment of prostate cancer and is under experimental 
investigation for therapeutic use in multiple malignancies. Clinical research on 
HIFU therapy for localized prostate cancer began in the 1990s, and there have 
now been ∼65,000 prostate cancer patients treated with HIFU, predominantly with 
the Ablatherm (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France) device. Neoadjuvant transurethral 
resection of the prostate has been combined with HIFU since 2000 to reduce 
prostate size, facilitate tissue destruction, and to minimize side effects. 
Advances in imaging technologies are expected to further improve the already 
superior efficacy and morbidity outcomes, and ongoing investigation of HIFU as a 
focal therapy in salvage and palliative indications is serving to expand the 
role of HIFU as a highly versatile noninvasive therapy for prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the traffic accident mortality in the Colombian older 
adults during the 1998-2012 period and show the loss of productive years and 
mortality from this cause. METHODS Quantitative study of the trend analysis of 
deaths in Colombia in traffic accidents, from 1998 to 2012, according to death 
records and population projected by the Colombian National Administrative 
Department of Statistics. Frequency distribution profile of the deceased, death 
rates per hundred thousand inhabitants, potential years of life lost and 
calculation of excess mortality by age in the over 60 were made. RESULTS In the 
study period 100,758 deaths occurred in traffic accidents, 6,717 annual average, 
of which 18.5% occurred in people aged 60 years and over. The predominated 
deaths were men; the risk of dying was 32.15 per hundred thousand people in this 
age range, with double risk of dying those under 60 years. CONCLUSIONS The young 
population has a higher proportion of deaths, but those over 60 years are at 
increased risk of death, leading to the need to turn our gaze to the improvement 
of road infrastructure and standards, to educate the population in self-care and 
compliance with safety measures and prepare society for an ever more adult 
population, more numerous and more prone to take risks.

OBJETIVO: Analizar la mortalidad por accidente de tránsito en el adulto mayor de 
Colombia.
MÉTODOS: Estudio cuantitativo del análisis de tendencias de las muertes 
ocurridas en Colombia por accidentes de tránsito entre 1998 y 2012, según los 
registros de defunción y la población proyectada para estos años, del 
Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadísticas. Se realizaron 
distribuciones de frecuencias del perfil de los fallecidos, tasas de mortalidad 
por 100 mil habitantes, años potenciales de vida perdidos y cálculo de 
sobremortalidad por edad en los mayores de 60 años.
RESULTADOS: Se presentaron 100.758 defunciones por accidentes de tránsito en el 
periodo, 6.717 promedio anual, de las cuales el 18,5% ocurrió en personas de 60 
años y más. Predominaron las muertes en hombres; el riesgo de morir fue de 32,1 
por 100 mil personas en este rango de edad, registrando el doble del riesgo de 
morir que los menores 60 años.
CONCLUSIONES: La población joven registra mayor proporción de defunciones, pero 
son los mayores de 60 años los que tienen mayor riesgo de morir. Es necesario 
dirigir la mirada al mejoramiento de la infraestructura y normatividad vial, a 
formar la población en el autocuidado y respeto de las medidas de seguridad, y a 
preparar a la sociedad para una población cada vez más adulta, más numerosa y 
más expuesta a asumir riesgos de esta naturaleza.

Aging is a nearly universal phenomenon in biology only partially controlled by 
genetic endowment. Individuals and their organs age at varying rates. The 
kidneys manifest the aging process by steady loss of nephrons and a 
corresponding decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) beginning about age 
30 years. The mechanisms responsible for this observation is are elusive. 
However, defining chronic kidney disease based on arbitrary, fixed thresholds of 
GFR in the later phases of life can be problematical as it may over-diagnosis 
CKD in the elderly. A modest, persisting reduction of GFR (around 45-59 
ml/min/1.73m2) without abnormal proteinuria does not seem to confer much of an 
adverse effect on mortality and remaining life expectancy in older adults and 
the development of end-stage renal disease in such subjects is very uncommon. 
Old kidneys should not be equated with "diseased" kidneys.

IMPORTANCE: The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events 
in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial reported that apixaban therapy was 
superior to warfarin therapy in preventing stroke and all-cause death while 
causing significantly fewer major bleeds. To establish the value proposition of 
substituting apixiban therapy for warfarin therapy in patients with atrial 
fibrillation, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using patient-level 
data from the ARISTOTLE trial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of apixaban therapy 
compared with warfarin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation from the 
perspective of the US health care system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic analysis uses patient-level 
resource use and clinical data collected in the ARISTOTLE trial, a multinational 
randomized clinical trial that observed 18 201 patients (3417 US patients) for a 
median of 1.8 years between 2006 and 2011.
INTERVENTIONS: Apixaban therapy vs warfarin therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Within-trial resource use and cost were compared 
between treatments, using externally derived US cost weights. Life expectancies 
for US patients were estimated according to their baseline risk and treatment 
using time-based and age-based survival models developed using the overall 
ARISTOTLE population. Quality-of-life adjustment factors were obtained from 
external sources. Cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained) was evaluated from a US perspective, and extensive sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 3417 US patients enrolled in ARISTOTLE, the mean (SD) age was 71 
(10) years; 2329 (68.2%) were male and 3264 (95.5%) were white. After 2 years of 
anticoagulation therapy, health care costs (excluding the study drug) of 
patients treated with apixaban therapy and warfarin therapy were not 
statistically different (difference, -$60; 95% CI, -$2728 to $2608). Life 
expectancy, modeled from ARISTOTLE outcomes, was significantly longer with 
apixaban therapy vs warfarin therapy (7.94 vs 7.54 quality-adjusted life years). 
The incremental cost, including cost of anticoagulant and monitoring, of 
achieving these benefits was within accepted US norms ($53 925 per 
quality-adjusted life year, with 98% likelihood of meeting a $100 000 
willingness-to-pay threshold). Results were generally consistent when model 
assumptions were varied, with lifetime cost-effectiveness most affected by the 
price of apixaban and the time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Apixaban therapy for ARISTOTLE-eligible patients with 
atrial fibrillation provides clinical benefits at an incremental cost that 
represents reasonable value for money judged using US benchmarks for 
cost-effectiveness.
