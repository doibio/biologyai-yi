OBJECTIVES: Patients with life-limiting illnesses are prone to unnecessary 
polypharmacy. Deprescribing tools may contribute to minimizing negative 
outcomes. Thus, the aims of the study were to identify validated instruments for 
deprescribing inappropriate medications for patients with palliative care needs 
and to assess the impact on clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in LILACS, PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE, 
and WEB OF SCIENCE databases (until May 2021). A manual search was performed in 
the references of enrolled articles. The screening, eligibility, extraction, and 
bias risk assessment were carried out by 2 independent researchers. Experimental 
and observational studies were eligible for inclusion.
RESULTS: Out of the 5791 studies retrieved, after excluding duplicates 
(n = 1050), conducting title/abstract screening (n = 4741), and full reading 
(n = 41), only 1 study met the inclusion criteria. In this included study, a 
randomized controlled trial was conducted, which showed a high level of bias 
risk overall. Adults 75 years or older (n = 130) with limited life expectancy 
and polypharmacy were allocated to 2 groups [intervention arm (deprescribing); 
and control arm (usual care)]. Deprescribing was performed with the aid of the 
STOPPFrail tool. The mean number of inappropriate medications and monthly 
medication costs were significantly lower in the intervention arm. No 
statistically significant differences were found in terms of unscheduled 
hospital presentations, falls, fractures, mortality, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of several instruments to support 
deprescribing in patients with palliative care needs, only 1 of them has 
undergone validation and robust assessment for effectiveness in clinical 
practice. The STOPPFrail tool appears to reduce the number of inappropriate 
medications for older people with limited life expectancy (and probably 
palliative care needs) and decrease the monthly costs of pharmacotherapy. 
Nevertheless, the impact on patient safety and humanistic outcomes remain 
unclear.

Sleep duration has been linked to a wide range of negative health outcomes and 
to reduced life expectancy. We present genome-wide association studies of short 
( ≤ 5 h) and long ( ≥ 10 h) sleep duration in adults of European (N = 445,966), 
African (N = 27,785), East Asian (N = 3141), and admixed-American (N = 16,250) 
ancestry from UK Biobank and the Million Veteran Programme. In a 
cross-population meta-analysis, we identify 84 independent loci for short sleep 
and 1 for long sleep. We estimate SNP-based heritability for both sleep traits 
in each ancestry based on population derived linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores 
using cov-LDSC. We identify positive genetic correlation between short and long 
sleep traits (rg = 0.16 ± 0.04; p = 0.0002), as well as similar patterns of 
genetic correlation with other psychiatric and cardiometabolic phenotypes. 
Mendelian randomisation reveals a directional causal relationship between short 
sleep and depression, and a bidirectional causal relationship between long sleep 
and depression.

INTRODUCTION: Prolactinomas resulting in pituitary apoplexy are an uncommon 
obstetrical complication. The hemorrhage can cause compression and necrosis of 
the pituitary gland as well as the optic chiasm, necessitating surgical 
intervention.
CASE: A 35-year-old woman, G0, presented for an infertility consult with a prior 
diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Evaluation for oligomenorrhea found an 
elevated prolactin level of 69.76 ng/mL, an elevated DHEA-S of 524, and HgbA1c 
of 5.7%. The patient denied visual or neurological symptoms. Infertility 
treatment was started, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was 
recommended; however, the patient forewent imaging. Within a few months, she was 
pregnant. At 27 weeks of gestation, the patient developed sudden visual field 
loss to the right eye and presented to her optometrist. MRI of the pituitary 
identified a sellar mass with suprasellar extension, consistent with a recently 
hemorrhaged pituitary macroadenoma or pituitary apoplexy with displacement of 
the optic chiasm. Due to the risks of permanent optic nerve damage, the patient 
underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal hypophysectomy with 
intraoperative fetal monitoring at 30 weeks 1 day of gestation. At 39 weeks of 
gestation a cesarean section was performed due to the recent procedure. Her 
delivery and postpartum period were without complications.
DISCUSSION: Pituitary apoplexy presenting in pregnancy is a rare and potentially 
life-threatening disorder due to an acute ischemic infarction or hemorrhage of 
the pituitary gland. Surgical management of the pituitary gland in pregnancy is 
rarely recommended, except in cases of severe visual disturbance and 
uncontrolled Cushing's disease.

The Middle-Income Trap (MIT) refers to the situation in which a country's per 
capita income can reach middle-class levels but remains there for years, making 
it difficult to move up to a higher income level. Indonesia was declared trapped 
in MIT in 2014, and in 2019, it was added to the group of upper-middle-income 
(UM) countries. However, due to COVID-19, it returned to the lower-middle income 
(UM) group in 2020. Previous studies inspired to see the existence of provinces 
in MIT Indonesia, so an MIT analysis was carried out for each province. The 
analysis aims to determine the characteristics of MIT in Indonesia and the 
factors that influence it and obtain a panel data regression model formed from 
MIT modeling. Analysis using panel data regression method. The panel data 
regression model was obtained based on panel data, namely data consisting of a 
combination of cross-section and time series data. The data used is GRDP per 
capita for each province in 2010 - 2020 published by the Central Bureau of 
Statistics (BPS). GRDP per capita data is used as an approach to calculating the 
MIT index. The results of the study, obtained three variables that have a 
significant effect on MIT, namely Life Expectancy, Gross Participation Rate, and 
Gross Fixed Capital Increase with an accuracy model of 97.65 %.

BACKGROUND: In healthy, nonelderly populations, prevalence of 3 modifiers of 
global spinal malalignment (GS-MalAlign) (PT ≧20°, PI-LL≧10°, SVA≧40 mm) remains 
unknown. The clinical significance has not been determined. The purposes are to 
disclose the prevalence of the 3 modifiers of GS-MalAlign, and evaluate the 
influence on LBP, and HR-QOL related to bone mineral density (BMD), skeletal 
muscle mass index (SMI), and back muscle extensors strength (BMES) in a healthy, 
nonelderly population.
METHODS: A mono-centric, cross-sectional survey. Three hundred and 2 
participants (18< age <65 years) without ADL disturbance were consecutively 
enrolled. Sagittal parameters of the spine and the pelvis were measure on whole 
spine radiograms. BMD and SMI were determined using DEXA. BMES was defined as a 
maximum extension force at the T4 to T7 level and measured by a strain-gauge 
dynamotor. LBP was checked through interview. HR-QOL was ascertained by score of 
Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36-Health Survey (SF-36v2).
RESULTS: The final analysis could be done in 84 females and 179 males. PT≧20°, 
PI-LL≧10°, and SVA≧40 mm were found in 12% (31/263), 11% (31/263), and 6% 
(16/263), and each mean value was 25.0 ± 4.0°, 15.3 ± 5.9°, and 52.7 ± 12.2 mm 
(Mean ± S.D.). Prevalence of LBP was significantly higher in the participants 
with PI-LL≧10° than with PI-LL<10°; 43% (12/28) versus 21% (49/235) (p<.05). 
PI-LL≧10° only had an association with LBP (OR: 3.0435, 95% CI, 1.1378-8.141, 
p<.05). Four 2% of participants (4/263) associated with all 3 modifiers had LBP 
and a significantly lower mental component summary score of SF-36v2 (p<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Some of individuals are associated with GS-MalAlign even in 
healthy, nonelderly populations. There is a possibility that PI-LL ≧10° results 
in LBP within a degree of no ADL disturbance, and it is speculated that 
coexistence of all 3 modifiers of GS-MalAlign would lead to a poor mental 
HR-QOL.

Exploring spatiotemporal trends and impacts of health resources and services on 
under-5 mortality in West African countries, 2010-2019: a spatial data analysis.

Health, Central South University, Changsha, China.

BACKGROUND: West African countries experienced the highest under-5 mortality 
rate (U5MR), the lowest life expectancy, and the poorest economic development. 
This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal trend of U5MR and spatial 
spillover effects of health resources and services to provide a basis for 
establishing health policies and international cooperative mechanisms in West 
Africa.
METHODS: We retrieved data from the World Health Organization's Global Health 
Observatory, the United Nations Human Development Report, and the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2019. Joinpoint regression analysis and Moran's I method were 
used to examine the temporal trend and spatial dependence of U5MR, respectively. 
Spatial regression analysis was used to examine the spatial spillover effects.
RESULTS: The long-term downward trends in U5MR were divided into multiple 
segments by two or three change points in 2013, 2014, or 2015, and the annual 
percentage change after 2015 was higher than before 2015. Global Moran's I was 
positive, significantly indicating positive spatial autocorrelation, which 
increased from 0.2850 (p = 0.0210) to 0.3597 (p = 0.0080). Based on spatial 
regression analysis, human development index (HDI), physicians density, nurses 
and midwives density, health center density, percentage of infants lacking 
immunization for diphtheria and measles, and coverage rate of at least one 
antenatal visit had negative spatial spillover effects on U5MR. HDI had the 
strongest negative correlation (β = -0.0187 to -0.1054, p < 0.0001). Current 
health expenditure (CHE) per capita had positive spatial spillover effects on 
U5MR.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the spatiotemporal trend of U5MR in West African 
countries and spatial spillover effects of health resources and services. 
Promoting economic development, increasing health human resources, health 
expenditure, vaccination rate, antenatal care coverage, and the proportion of 
health professionals attending births not only reduced the local U5MR but also 
exerted spatial spillover effects on adjacent countries. The West African Health 
Organization may consider regional spillover mechanisms to develop regional 
health policy and intervention cooperation mechanisms, which will contribute to 
achieving the sustainable development goal on U5MR, Africa Agenda 2063, and 
universal health coverage.

BACKGROUND: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterized by motor and phonic tics.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of deutetrabenazine (Teva 
Neuroscience, Inc, Parsippany, NJ), a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 
inhibitor, in children and adolescents with TS.
METHODS: Alternatives for Reducing Tics in TS (ARTISTS) open-label extension 
(OLE) (NCT03567291) was a 54-week, global, phase 3, open-label extension study 
of deutetrabenazine (6-48 mg daily) conducted May 28, 2018 to April 3, 2020 with 
a 2-week randomized withdrawal period. Participants (6-16 years of age) had TS 
and active tics causing distress or impairment. Safety (primary outcome) was 
assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and clinical laboratory 
testing. Efficacy was measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic 
Score (YGTSS-TTS).
RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population (228 participants; mean age, 12.0 years; 
79.8% male; 86.4% white) had a median (range) duration of exposure of 28.4 
(0.3-52.9) weeks. Of 227 participants in the safety analysis, 161 (70.9%) 
reported ≥1 TEAE (exposure-adjusted incidence rate, 2.77/patient-year), of which 
95 (41.9%) were treatment related. The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
headaches, somnolence, nasopharyngitis, weight increases, and anxiety. No 
additional safety signals were observed. Worsening of YGTSS-TTS after the 2-week 
randomized withdrawal was not statistically significant (least squares mean 
difference, -0.4; P = 0.78). Several exploratory measures showed sustained 
improvement throughout the treatment periods.
CONCLUSIONS: In this long-term, open-label trial, deutetrabenazine was well 
tolerated with low frequency of TEAEs. There was no significant difference in 
tics between treatment arms during the 2-week randomized withdrawal period, 
however, descriptive statistics and comparison with baseline showed a numeric 
improvement in tics, quality of life, and other measures.

3D chromatin organization plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, 
DNA replication, recombination, and repair. While initially discovered for its 
role in sister chromatid cohesion, emerging evidence suggests that the cohesin 
complex (SMC1, SMC3, RAD21, and SA1/SA2), facilitated by NIPBL, mediates 
topologically associating domains and chromatin loops through DNA loop 
extrusion. However, information on how conformational changes of cohesin-NIPBL 
drive its loading onto DNA, initiation, and growth of DNA loops is still 
lacking. In this study, high-speed atomic force microscopy imaging reveals that 
cohesin-NIPBL captures DNA through arm extension, assisted by feet (shorter 
protrusions), and followed by transfer of DNA to its lower compartment (SMC 
heads, RAD21, SA1, and NIPBL). While binding at the lower compartment, arm 
extension leads to the capture of a second DNA segment and the initiation of a 
DNA loop that is independent of ATP hydrolysis. The feet are likely contributed 
by the C-terminal domains of SA1 and NIPBL and can transiently bind to DNA to 
facilitate the loading of the cohesin complex onto DNA. Furthermore, high-speed 
atomic force microscopy imaging reveals distinct forward and reverse DNA loop 
extrusion steps by cohesin-NIPBL. These results advance our understanding of 
cohesin by establishing direct experimental evidence for a multistep DNA-binding 
mechanism mediated by dynamic protein conformational changes.

OBJECTIVES: Many people with type 2 diabetes experience clinical inertia, 
remaining in poor glycaemic control on oral glucose-lowering medications rather 
than intensifying treatment with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, 
despite an efficacious, orally administered option, oral semaglutide, being 
available. The present study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
initiating oral semaglutide versus continuing metformin plus sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor therapy in the UK.
DESIGN: Outcomes were projected over patients' lifetimes using the IQVIA Core 
Diabetes Model (V.9.0). Clinical data were taken from the oral semaglutide and 
placebo arms of the patient subgroup receiving metformin plus an SGLT-2 
inhibitor in PIONEER 4. Costs, expressed in 2021 Pounds sterling (GBP), were 
accounted from a healthcare payer perspective.
INTERVENTIONS: Modelled patients received oral semaglutide immediately (in the 
first year of the analysis) or after a 2-year delay, after which all 
physiological parameters were brought to values observed in the immediate 
therapy arm. During the simulation, patients intensified with the addition of 
basal insulin and, subsequently, by switching to basal-bolus insulin.
RESULTS: Immediate oral semaglutide therapy was associated with improvements in 
life expectancy of 0.17 (95% CIs 0.16 to 0.19) years, and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 0.15 (0.14 to 0.16) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), versus a 
2-year delay. Benefits were due to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related 
complications. Direct costs were estimated to be GBP 1423 (1349 to 1496) higher 
with immediate oral semaglutide therapy versus a 2-year delay, with higher 
treatment costs partially offset by cost savings from avoidance of 
diabetes-related complications. Immediate oral semaglutide therapy was therefore 
associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 9404 (8380 to 10 
538) per QALY gained versus a 2-year delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate oral semaglutide is likely to represent a cost-effective 
treatment in people with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on 
metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting multiple organs, 
primarily the lungs and digestive system. Improved pulmonary management 
significantly improved life expectancy of CF patients. As a result, 
extrapulmonary manifestations, including gastrointestinal and liver-related 
symptoms, have become more relevant. We previously reported that the osmotic 
laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG), which hydrates the CF gut, decreased fecal 
bile acid loss in a CF knockout mouse model. In the current study we 
investigated the effect of PEG on intestinal fat and cholesterol absorption and 
on CF-related liver features in a CF mouse model with the most common CF-causing 
mutation.
METHODS: CftrΔF508/ΔF508 (n=13) and wild-type (WT) (n=12) mice were treated with 
PEG for 2 weeks. The intestinal and hepatic effects of PEG were assessed by 
analysis of intestinal bile acid, cholesterol, and fat fluxes, transcriptome 
analysis as well as histology.
RESULTS: PEG improved intestinal malabsorption of bile acids, fat, and 
cholesterol in CftrΔF508/ΔF508 mice. Transcriptome analysis showed that PEG 
partially restored the intestinal signaling of nuclear receptors RXR, FXR, and 
CAR/PXR, which are involved in bile acid and xenobiotic metabolism. PEG also 
reduced liver inflammation in CF mice as assessed by transcriptome and 
histological analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: PEG, a non-absorbable osmotic laxative, improved intestinal 
nutrient absorption, intestinal bile acid and xenobiotic signaling, as well as 
CF-related liver features. These findings highlight the potential for osmotic 
laxation to improve gastrointestinal complications of CF in humans.

PURPOSE: Data are limited pertaining to the long-term benefits of aflibercept 
treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The aim of 
this study was to provide outcomes, safety, durability and quality-of-life data 
with aflibercept using a modified treat, extend and fixed regime over 4 years.
METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, single cohort observational study of 
treatment-naïve nAMD participants treated with aflibercept as 2-year extension 
of the MATE-trial that compared early and late Treat-and-Extend for 2 years. 
Refracted ETDRS best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness 
(CRT), treatment interval and adverse events were assessed. Quality-of-life was 
measured using the Macular Disease Dependent Quality of Life (MacDQoL) and 
Macular Disease Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaires (MacTSQ).
RESULTS: Twenty-six of 40 participants completing the MATE-trial were enrolled 
with 20 completing the total 4-year study. Mean BCVA was 60.7 at Month 0 and 
64.8 ETDRS letters at Month 48 while CRT decreased from 423.7 μm to 292.2 μm. 
Five participants discontinued treatment due to inactivity. The mean number of 
treatments and visits for the remaining participants was 27 and 30.0, 
respectively, with treatment intervals extended to 12 weeks in four participants 
at Month 48. Both AMD-specific QoL and treatment satisfaction remained stable 
between Months 0 and 48 and mean BCVA significantly correlated with AMD-specific 
QoL scores at Months 12, 24 and 48.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that BCVA can be maintained over 48 months when 
following a treat-extend-and-fix regimen of aflibercept with intervals out to 
12 weeks, while maintaining AMD-specific QoL and treatment satisfaction.

BACKGROUND: For patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, reaching minimal 
residual disease (MRD) negativity after treatment is associated with improved 
outcomes; however, the use of MRD to modulate therapy remains elusive. We 
present the final analysis of the MASTER trial of daratumumab, carfilzomib, 
lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Dara-KRd) therapy in patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma, in which MRD status is used to modulate treatment 
duration and cessation.
METHODS: MASTER was a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial conducted in five 
academic medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants were 18 years or 
older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (measurable by serum or urine 
protein electrophoresis or serum free light chains), a life expectancy of at 
least 12 months, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 
0-2, and had received no previous treatment for multiple myeloma except up to 
one cycle of therapy containing bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone. 
The study was enriched for participants with high-risk chromosome abnormalities 
(HRCAs). During the induction phase, participants received four 28-day cycles of 
Dara-KRd, each comprising daratumumab (16 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22), carfilzomib (56 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15), lenalidomide 
(25 mg orally on days 1-21), and dexamethasone (40 mg orally or intravenously on 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22); induction was followed by autologous haematopoietic 
stem-cell transplantation and up to two phases of consolidation with Dara-KRd. 
We assessed MRD by next-generation sequencing after or during each phase. The 
primary endpoint was reaching MRD negativity (<10-5). Participants who reached 
MRD negativity after or during two consecutive phases stopped treatment and 
began observation with MRD surveillance (MRD-SURE); participants who did not 
reach two consecutive MRD-negative results received maintenance lenalidomide. 
Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and cumulative incidence 
of progression. All analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat 
population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03224507, and 
is complete.
FINDINGS: Between Mar 21, 2018, and Oct 23, 2020, 123 participants were 
recruited to the study, of whom 70 (57%) were men, 53 (43%) were women, 94 (76%) 
were non-Hispanic White, 25 (20%) were non-Hispanic Black, and four (3%) were of 
another race or ethnicity. The median age of participants was 61 years (IQR 
55-68), and 24 (20%) were aged 70 years or older. The median duration of follow 
up was 42·2 months (IQR 34·5-46·0). Of the 123 participants, 53 (43%) had no 
HRCAs, 46 (37%) had one HRCA, and 24 (20%) had two or more HRCAs. For 118 (96%) 
of 123 participants, MRD was evaluable by next-generation sequencing; the 
remaining five had an absence of sufficiently unique clonogenic sequences to 
enable tracking by the assay. Of these 118 participants, 96 (81%, 95% CI 73-88) 
reached MRD of less than 10-5 (comprising 39 [78%, 64-88] of 50 participants 
with no HRCAs, 38 [86%, 73-95] of 44 participants with one HRCA, and 19 [79%, 
58-93] of 24 participants with two or more HRCAs) and 84 (71%, 62-79) reached 
MRD-SURE and treatment cessation. 36-month progression-free survival among all 
123 participants was 88% (95% CI 78-95) for participants with no HRCAs, 79% 
(67-88) for those with one HRCA, and 50% (30-70) for those with two or more 
HRCAs. For the 84 participants reaching MRD-SURE, the 24-month cumulative 
incidence of progression from cessation of therapy was 9% (95% CI 1-19) for 
participants with no HRCAs, 9% (1-18) for those with one HRCA, and 47% (23-72) 
for those with two or more HRCAs. 61 participants (comprising 52% of 118 
MRD-evaluable participants and 73% of 84 participants who reached MRD-SURE) 
remain free of therapy and MRD-negative as of Feb 7, 2023. The most common grade 
3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (43 patients, 35%), lymphopenia (28 
patients, 23%), and hypertension (13 patients, 11%). Three treatment-emergent 
deaths were recorded: two sudden deaths and one due to viral infection, none of 
which were judged to be treatment-related.
INTERPRETATION: This approach provided positive outcomes and a pathway for 
treatment cessation in most patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
Outcomes for patients with ultra-high-risk multiple myeloma, defined as those 
with two or more HRCAs, remain unsatisfactory, and these patients should be 
prioritised for trials with early introduction of therapies with novel 
mechanisms of action.

AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of high-dose, dual-antibiotic cement 
versus single-antibiotic cement for the treatment of displaced intracapsular hip 
fractures in older adults.
METHODS: Using data from a multicentre randomized controlled trial (World Hip 
Trauma Evaluation 8 (WHiTE-8)) in the UK, a within-trial economic evaluation was 
conducted. Resource usage was measured over 120 days post randomization, and 
cost-effectiveness was reported in terms of incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), gained from the UK NHS and personal social 
services (PSS) perspective in the base-case analysis. Methodological uncertainty 
was addressed using sensitivity analysis, while decision uncertainty was handled 
using confidence ellipses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that high-dose, dual-antibiotic cement 
had a significantly higher mean cost (£224 (95% confidence interval (CI) -408 to 
855)) and almost the same QALYs (0.001 (95% CI -0.002 to 0.003)) relative to 
single-antibiotic cement from the UK NHS and PSS perspective. The probability of 
the high-dose, dual-antibiotic cement being cost-effective was less than 0.3 at 
alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds, and its net monetary benefit was 
negative. This finding remained robust in the sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that high-dose, dual-antibiotic cement is unlikely 
to be cost-effective compared to single-antibiotic cement for the treatment of 
displaced intracapsular hip fractures in older adults.

AIMS: When a total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) fails, it can be converted to a 
fusion or a revision arthroplasty. Despite the increasing numbers of TAAs being 
undertaken, there is little information in the literature about the management 
of patients undergoing fusion following a failed TAA. The primary aim of this 
study was to analyze the survival of fusions following a failed TAA using a 
large dataset from the National Joint Registry (NJR).
METHODS: A data linkage study combined NJR and NHS Digital data. Failure of a 
TAA was defined as a fusion, revision to a further TAA, or amputation. Life 
tables and Kaplan-Meier graphs were used to record survival. Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were fitted to compare the rates of failure.
RESULTS: A total of 131 patients underwent fusion as a salvage procedure 
following TAA. Their mean age was 65.7 years (SD 10.6) and 73 (55.7%) were male. 
The mean follow-up was 47.5 months (SD 27.2). The mean time between TAA and 
fusion was 5.3 years (SD 2.7). Overall, 32 (24.4%) underwent reoperations other 
than revision and 29 (22.1%) failed. Of these 24 (18.3%) underwent revision of 
the fusion and five (3.8%) had a below-knee amputation. No patients underwent 
conversion to a further TAA. Failure usually occurred in the first three 
postoperative years with one-year survival of fusion being 96.0% (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 90.7 to 98.3) and three-year survival in 69 patients being 77.5% 
(95% CI 68.3 to 84.4).
CONCLUSION: Salvage fusion after a failed TAA shows moderate rates of failure 
and reoperations. Nearly 25% of patients required revision within three years. 
This study is an extension of studies using the same methodology reporting the 
failure rates and risk factors for failure, which have recently been published, 
and also one reporting the outcome of revision TAA for a failed primary TAA, 
using the same methodology, which will shortly be published.

Associated with longer life expectancy, greater survival of patients with 
cardiovascular disorders, and increased use of wearable and 
insertable/implantable devices capable of detection, the frequency of atrial 
fibrillation (AF) diagnosis is increasing. This chapter describes two 
representative patient cases that were used to enable a discussion of the 
evaluation and management of AF in different scenarios. One patient is young and 
healthy with paroxysmal AF but no major comorbidities (though there is a family 
history of AF). The other is older with multiple complicating comorbidities. 
These cases sparked an active discussion among the panelists that demonstrated 
not only the multitude of considerations when choosing the optimal therapy for 
each individual, but also the individualistic differences in biases and styles 
that can exist between experts in the field. The results of these discussions 
revealed agreement that.
