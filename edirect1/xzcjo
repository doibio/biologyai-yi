divisions. In contrast, higher rates of married people and more precipitation in 
a division were significantly associated with less YLL. We provide an evidence 
base and a transferable approach that can guide health policy and intervention 
in sub-national regions afflicted by disease burden in Kenya and other areas of 
comparable settings.

Due to demographic change, especially in Western countries with increasing life 
expectancy and a continuously increasing number of elderly, chronic pruritus 
(CP) is more and more observed in clinical practice. CP in elderly may present 
with specific pruritic skin diseases, as chronic prurigo (nodular form) and can 
also occur in unaffected, normal looking skin. CP in elderly remains 
a challenge. Especially CP without any skin lesions is a major diagnostic and 
therapeutic challenge. Due to the increasing prevalence of malignant diseases in 
elderlies, paraneoplastic pruritus is also an important differential diagnosis. 
Treatment depends on the mobility of the patient which determines if and which 
topical agents can be used and if ultraviolet phototherapy can be administered. 
There are a number of topical and systemic medications, which must be selected 
according to existing comorbidities, possible drug interactions, and the 
patient's compliance as well as possible side effects such as cognition and 
sedation. All this may hamper treatment of CP in elderly.

INTRODUCTION: Complex ureteric strictures present a significant challenge to the 
endourologist and uro-radiologist. Multiple separate interventions to try to 
cross the stricture are often attempted. We describe our experience managing a 
heterogenous patient group using the 'rendezvous' procedure.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: 16 patients and 18 ureters (one bilateral procedure, and 
two separate procedures in one patient) underwent rendezvous procedures. Seven 
patients had coexisting ureteric calculi treated. Each case was followed up for 
between 3 months and 5 years.
RESULTS: In 16/18 ureters there was technical success at time of surgery; 
successfully crossing the stricture, allowing ureteroscopic access to the 
ureter, dilating and/or stenting the ureter. 2/18 were unsuccessful; one 
secondary to advanced malignancy resulting in a uretero-vaginal fistula and the 
second a failure to remove a retained, displaced ureteric stent. Of the 18 
ureteric procedures; 7/18 were stent free at 3 months, improving to 8/18 stent 
free at 6 months. 4/18 remained nephrostomy dependent (failure of drainage 
despite stent or failure to stent) at 3 months, increasing to 6/18 being 
nephrostomy dependent at 6 months. 1/16 remained dialysis dependent with a 
nephrostomy tube. For those procedures involving ureteric calculi, 6/7 were 
stone free and 1/5 had a persistent stone fragment requiring further 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: A combined approach may decrease the number of separate 
interventions required, with the aim of removing the need for a long-term 
nephrostomy, as well as providing opportunity to treat ureteric calculi in the 
context of stricture disease. Our experience has been that where the rendezvous 
has been required to treat strictures caused by malignant extrinsic compression, 
stenting has not been successful; this information is key to informed consent in 
a group of patients who may have a limited life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: The increase of HIV-patients life expectancy leads to a new model of 
patient with chronic diseases and polymedicated. For this reason we ought to  
know in clinical practice the prevalence of polypharmacy and drug-drug  
interactions between the antiretroviral drugs and comedication in our patients 
in  order to identify and prevent them.
METHOD: A retrospective, descriptive study carried out in &gt; 50 years 
old patients on antiretroviral treatment. Results: We included 242 patients of 
whom 148 (61%) were receiving concomitant treatment. 243 potential interactions 
were detected,  where 197 are considered moderate and 46 severe, affecting 110 
patients. 35  (76%) interactions were related to boosted protease inhibitors. 
The main  consequence of these interactions was the increase in plasma 
concentrations of  comedication (48%). Statins were the comedication most 
involved in severe  drug-druginteractions (24%), followed by inhaled 
corticosteroids (15%).
CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy was found in about half of our study population and 
the prevalence of drug-drug interactions was high. Hospital pharmacists may  
play a crucial role in their detection, management and early communication.

Publisher: Objetivo: El aumento de la esperanza de vida conduce a un nuevo 
modelo de  paciente VIH positivo, con enfermedades crónicas y, en 
ocasiones, polimedicado. Pretendemos con este estudio conocer la complejidad de 
los tratamientos e  identificar potenciales interacciones entre 
antirretrovirales y medicación  domiciliaria de nuestros pacientes, con objeto 
de tenerlas identificadas y poder  prevenirlas.Método: Estudio descriptivo, 
retrospectivo, en una cohorte de pacientes con  tratamiento antirretroviral 
mayores de 50 años en un hospital de tercer grado. Resultados: Se incluyeron 242 
pacientes, de los que 148 (61%) recibían algún  otro tratamiento. Detectamos 243 
potenciales interacciones: 197 consideradas  moderadas y 46 graves; afectando a 
110 pacientes. De las graves, 35 (76%) se  relacionaron con inhibidores de 
proteasa potenciados. La principal consecuencia  fue un aumento de las 
concentraciones plasmáticas del tratamiento domiciliario  (48%). Las estatinas 
(24%) fueron el grupo especialmente implicado en las  interacciones graves, 
seguidas de los corticoides inhalados (15%). Conclusiones: Prácticamente la 
mitad de los pacientes estaban polimedicados, observándose un elevado número de 
potenciales interacciones moderadas o graves. El farmacéutico de hospital debe 
jugar un  papel crucial en su detección, manejo y comunicación precoz.

PURPOSE: Patients with p16/human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma have a favorable outcome after treatment. In this group 
of patients who could have a long life expectancy, the optimal surveillance 
strategy and modality is not well established. We aim to determine the ability 
of a negative postradiation positron emission tomography (PET)/computed 
tomography scan to predict the risk of subsequent relapse in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with 
p16/HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who completed 
definitive (chemo)radiation therapy and had a posttreatment PET/computed 
tomography scan from 2006 to 2013 was performed. Patient, tumor, and treatment 
characteristics and clinical outcomes were recorded. Tumors were considered 
HPV/p16 positive if either HPV (by in situ hybridization) or p16 (by 
immunohistochemistry) was positive. Disease-free survival and overall survival 
rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: In our study, 327 patients were evaluated. The median age was 57 years. 
The most common primary sites were base of tongue (50%) and tonsil (48%). Of the 
patients evaluated, 291 (89%) had a negative posttreatment PET scan. For these 
291 patients who had a complete metabolic response after treatment, the 5-year 
disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 91% and 89%, respectively. 
The median time to development of recurrence was 16 months. Of the 291 patients, 
24 patients (8%) had disease recurrence; 13 recurrences were locoregional, and 
13 were distant. Eleven (4%) patients with recurrence had further surgery or 
radiation, and 8 patients (3%) were without disease as of the last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who achieve a complete metabolic response on posttreatment 
PET imaging have an excellent prognosis, and the risk of developing a recurrence 
in the future is very low. Therefore, a more cost effective surveillance program 
should be considered for this subgroup of patients.

OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the prevalence of sarcopenia among systemic sclerosis 
(SSc) patients with respect to quality of life, disability, organ involvement, 
and muscle function.
METHODS: A total of 129 patients who met the ACR/EULAR 2013 classification 
criteria were included. Body composition was measured using bioelectric 
impedance analysis. Sarcopenia was defined according to the criteria of the 
European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Handgrip and knee 
extension strength and pulmonary peak flow were measured. Physical function was 
assessed with the Short Form-36 Health Survey and Scleroderma Health Assessment 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Sarcopenia was prevalent in 22.5% of patients. There were significant 
differences between patients with and without sarcopenia regarding handgrip 
strength (11.5 [2.0-30.0] versus 18.0 [1.0-41.0] kilogram force [kgf]; P <0.001) 
and knee extension strength (11.0 [3.5-32.5] versus 17.5 [3.5-88.0] kgf; 
P = 0.006), physical function (38.8 [9.9-85.0] versus 48.8 [0-88.0]; P = 0.032) 
and number of immunosuppressants (2 [0-4] versus 1 [0-5]; P = 0.009). There were 
no differences regarding age (57.0 [32.0-83.0] versus 60.5 [28.0-82.0] years; 
P = 0.350) and disease duration (8 [1-27] versus 7 [0-34] years; P = 0.350).
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is common in patients with SSc and is associated with 
physical impairment that affects everyday life and participation in work. 
Interestingly, although age is the main risk factor for sarcopenia in the 
general population, it did not differ between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic SSc 
patients in our study. Instead, the number of immunosuppressive drugs was 
significantly higher among sarcopenic patients.

With advances in health care practices and delivery, the overall life expectancy 
of the Western population has increased. For those practitioners involved in the 
care of the patient with advanced cardiac disease, there has been a resultant 
higher prevalence of increasingly frail and older patients undergoing complex 
cardiac procedures. The higher rates of comorbid-associated higher 
vulnerability, with associated deconditioning, predisposes older, frail patients 
to poorer postoperative outcomes and a complicated recovery process after 
cardiac surgery. In addition, such patients experience inferior quality of life 
as a result of reduced ability to independently perform activities of daily 
living. During the preoperative waiting period, the cardiac symptoms and anxiety 
induces inactivity that in turn compounds the physical and mental 
deconditioning. To improve functional capacity and enhance postoperative 
recovery, prehabilitation, a component of the enhanced recovery after surgery 
model, might be of particular importance. In some studies, the preoperative 
improvement of the baseline physical, nutritional, and mental status has been 
reported to improve postoperative outcomes and enhance recovery after cardiac 
surgery. To address these domains, a 3-way approach to prehabilitation that is 
targeted toward improving nutritional status (N), exercise capacity (E) and 
worry reduction (W) (nutrition, exercise, and worry; "NEW" approach) might 
facilitate the perioperative management by ameliorating the postoperative 
outcomes and alleviating the surgical stress-related health deconditioning. In 
this review, the NEW approach and its potential benefits on postoperative 
outcomes as well as an implementation model (Promoting Action on Research 
Implementation in Health Services [PARiHS] framework) to aid institutional level 
implementation is described.

New Dimensions in Palliative Care Cardiology.

The landscape of patient care at the beginning of the 19th century was 
dramatically different than it is today. With few good treatment options, 
illness courses were generally brief. Near the end of life, patients were 
attended to by spiritual advisors, not health care professionals. Death 
typically occurred at home, surrounded by friends and family. Moving to the 
present time, decades of medical advances have significantly improved life 
expectancy. Cardiology has particularly benefited from many of these advances. 
Cardiac patients are initiated on optimal medication regimens. As disease 
burdens progress, interventions such as implantable defibrillators and cardiac 
resynchronization pacing systems become options for many patients. With further 
clinical deterioration, select patients might be candidates for ventricular 
assist devices and heart transplants. These advances have unquestionably 
improved the prognosis with advanced cardiovascular illnesses. However, they 
have also changed patient and family attitudes about death and dying, to the 
point where we have effectively "medicalized our mortality." The importance of 
introducing palliative care to the cardiac patient population is now well 
recognized, with the major cardiovascular societies incorporating palliative 
care principles into their guideline and consensus statement documents. However, 
despite this recognition, few cardiac patients get access to palliative care and 
other resources such as hospice. In this article the existing literature on this 
topic is reviewed and opportunities for developing and fostering a more 
collaborative relationship between the disciplines of cardiology and palliative 
care are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: Life expectancy plays a key role in the selection of patients with 
stage III colon cancer for adjuvant chemotherapy, but little is known about 
causes of mortality in older patients with colon cancer. We aimed to examine 
causes of death in this population and compare these causes between patients who 
received chemotherapy and those who did not. Specifically, we chose to examine 
the rates of death related to recurrent colon cancer versus non colon cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 50 and older diagnosed with stage III colon 
cancer between 2005 and 2009 were included. Patients were divided into "younger" 
(aged 50-69) and "older" (aged 70+). Causes of death, which were categorized 
into colon cancer versus non-colon cancer related.
RESULTS: 1361 patients were included, 50% of whom were 70 or older. Younger 
patients were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (90% vs. 60%). 601 
patients died in the follow up period. Deceased patients in the younger group 
were more likely to die from colon cancer (81% vs. 62%). The most common cause 
of non-colon cancer death was other primary malignancies in younger patients and 
cardiovascular diseases in older patients. In older patients who received 
chemotherapy, 41% died; 89% of these deaths were related to colon cancer. In 
older patients who did not receive chemotherapy 72% died, with 38% of patients 
ultimately dying from colon cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients remain under-treated with chemotherapy. Although 
non-colon cancer deaths were more frequent in older patients with cancer, colon 
cancer was a still a significant cause of mortality. These deaths may be 
preventable with adjuvant chemotherapy.

Continuous duodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an 
established treatment to control motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
Duodenal infusion allows a steady absorption of the drug in the small bowel, 
reducing plasmatic fluctuations of levodopa. Some complications may occur during 
the treatment, often related to intrajejunal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy 
(PEG-J). We report a case of duodenal ulcer associated with a phytobezoar 
involving the end of jejunal probe, in a patient who underwent PEG-J for LCIG 
infusion. In the last 2 weeks, the patient suffered from abdominal pain and 
dyspepsia. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an ulcerative lesion of the 
duodenum due to traction of the jejunal tube; the end of the jejunal tube was 
wrapped in a phytobezoar. This case is interesting because of the extension of 
the ulcerative lesion due to PEG-J dislocation and because of the subtle 
symptoms associated with it.

OBJECTIVE: Two separate changes in insurance regulation have altered mental 
health delivery to Americans: (i) the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity 
Act (MHPA 2008) and (ii) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA 
2010). This study aims to model and provide estimates for the costs and effects 
of depression that are impacted by these regulations.
METHOD: Literature exists on the effectiveness of insurance coverage in reducing 
the prevalence, the costs of treatment and lost productivity time, as well as 
the health related quality of life (HRQL) associated with depression. Data from 
this literature is employed in a Markov model to obtain costs and effects 
associated with depression under both the MHPA and the ACA regulations as 
compared to without either one.
RESULTS: The implementation of these regulations may reduce the per capita 
lifetime costs of depression treatment and lost productivity by USD 215 and 
enhance life expectancy by 0.01 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) per capita.
CONCLUSIONS: If the savings of these regulations are expanded over the entire 
cohort of Americans adults, the potential cost savings from treated depression 
are estimated at USD 47.30 billion in addition to 2.2 million QALYs saved.

OBJECTIVE: A significant portion of patients with Clostridium difficile 
infections (CDI) experience recurrence, and there is little consensus on its 
treatment. With the availability of newer agents for CDI and the added burdens 
of recurrent disease, a cost-effectiveness analysis may provide insight on the 
most efficient use of resources.
DESIGN: A decision-tree analysis was created to compare the cost-effectiveness 
of 3 possible treatments for patients with first CDI recurrence: oral 
vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab plus vancomycin. The model was 
performed from a payer's perspective with direct cost inputs and a timeline of 1 
year. A systematic review of literature was performed to identify clinical, 
utility, and cost data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold was set at $100,000 per QALY gained. The robustness of the model was 
tested using one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Vancomycin had the lowest cost ($15,692) and was associated with a QALY 
gain of 0.8019 years. Bezlotoxumab plus vancomycin was a dominated strategy. 
Fidaxomicin led to a higher QALY compared to vancomycin, at an incremental cost 
of $500,975 per QALY gained. Based on our WTP threshold, vancomycin alone was 
the most cost-effective regimen for treating the first recurrence of CDI. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the model's robustness.
CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin alone appears to be the most cost-effective regimen for 
the treatment of first recurrence of CDI. Fidaxomicin alone led to the highest 
QALY gained, but at a cost beyond what is considered cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend walking to increase moderate to vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA) for health benefits.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of 
a pedometer-based walking intervention in inactive adults, delivered postally or 
through dedicated practice nurse physical activity (PA) consultations.
DESIGN: Parallel three-arm trial, cluster randomised by household.
SETTING: Seven London-based general practices.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11,015 people without PA contraindications, aged 45-75 
years, randomly selected from practices, were invited. A total of 6399 people 
were non-responders, and 548 people self-reporting achieving PA guidelines were 
excluded. A total of 1023 people from 922 households were randomised to usual 
care (n = 338), postal intervention (n = 339) or nurse support (n = 346). The 
recruitment rate was 10% (1023/10,467). A total of 956 participants (93%) 
provided outcome data.
INTERVENTIONS: Intervention groups received pedometers, 12-week walking 
programmes advising participants to gradually add '3000 steps in 30 minutes' 
most days weekly and PA diaries. The nurse group was offered three dedicated PA 
consultations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary and main secondary outcomes were changes from 
baseline to 12 months in average daily step counts and time in MVPA (in 
≥ 10-minute bouts), respectively, from 7-day accelerometry. Individual 
resource-use data informed the within-trial economic evaluation and the Markov 
model for simulating long-term cost-effectiveness. Qualitative evaluations 
assessed nurse and participant views. A 3-year follow-up was conducted.
RESULTS: Baseline average daily step count was 7479 [standard deviation (SD) 
2671], average minutes per week in MVPA bouts was 94 minutes (SD 102 minutes) 
for those randomised. PA increased significantly at 12 months in both 
intervention groups compared with the control group, with no difference between 
interventions; additional steps per day were 642 steps [95% confidence interval 
(CI) 329 to 955 steps] for the postal group and 677 steps (95% CI 365 to 989 
steps) for nurse support, and additional MVPA in bouts (minutes per week) was 33 
minutes per week (95% CI 17 to 49 minutes per week) for the postal group and 35 
minutes per week (95% CI 19 to 51 minutes per week) for nurse support. 
Intervention groups showed no increase in adverse events. Incremental cost per 
step was 19p and £3.61 per minute in a ≥ 10-minute MVPA bout for nurse support, 
whereas the postal group took more steps and cost less than the control group. 
The postal group had a 50% chance of being cost-effective at a £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) threshold within 1 year and had both lower 
costs [-£11M (95% CI -£12M to -£10M) per 100,000 population] and more QALYs [759 
QALYs gained (95% CI 400 to 1247 QALYs)] than the nurse support and control 
groups in the long term. Participants and nurses found the interventions 
acceptable and enjoyable. Three-year follow-up data showed persistent 
intervention effects (nurse support plus postal vs. control) on steps per day 
[648 steps (95% CI 272 to 1024 steps)] and MVPA bouts [26 minutes per week (95% 
CI 8 to 44 minutes per week)].
LIMITATIONS: The 10% recruitment level, with lower levels in Asian and 
socioeconomically deprived participants, limits the generalisability of the 
findings. Assessors were unmasked to the group.
CONCLUSIONS: A primary care pedometer-based walking intervention in 45- to 
75-year-olds increased 12-month step counts by around one-tenth, and time in 
MVPA bouts by around one-third, with similar effects for the nurse support and 
postal groups, and persistent 3-year effects. The postal intervention provides 
cost-effective, long-term quality-of-life benefits. A primary care pedometer 
intervention delivered by post could help address the public health physical 
inactivity challenge.

BACKGROUND: As Indonesia moves to provide health coverage for all citizens, 
understanding patterns of morbidity and mortality is important to allocate 
resources and address inequality. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 study (GBD 
2016) estimates sources of early death and disability, which can inform policies 
to improve health care.
METHODS: We used GBD 2016 results for cause-specific deaths, years of life lost, 
years lived with disability, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life 
expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, and risk factors for 333 causes in 
Indonesia and in seven comparator countries. Estimates were produced by 
location, year, age, and sex using methods outlined in GBD 2016. Using the 
Socio-demographic Index, we generated expected values for each metric and 
compared these against observed results.
FINDINGS: In Indonesia between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased by 8·0 
years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 7·3-8·8) to 71·7 years (71·0-72·3): the 
increase was 7·4 years (6·4-8·6) for males and 8·7 years (7·8-9·5) for females. 
Total DALYs due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes 
decreased by 58·6% (95% UI 55·6-61·6), from 43·8 million (95% UI 41·4-46·5) to 
18·1 million (16·8-19·6), whereas total DALYs from non-communicable diseases 
rose. DALYs due to injuries decreased, both in crude rates and in 
age-standardised rates. The three leading causes of DALYs in 2016 were ischaemic 
heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary risks were a 
leading contributor to the DALY burden, accounting for 13·6% (11·8-15·4) of 
DALYs in 2016.
INTERPRETATION: Over the past 27 years, health across many indicators has 
improved in Indonesia. Improvements are partly offset by rising deaths and a 
growing burden of non-communicable diseases. To maintain and increase health 
gains, further work is needed to identify successful interventions and improve 
health equity.

BACKGROUND: Timely identifying people with intellectual disabilities in need of 
palliative care is important. Therefore, we developed PALLI: a screening tool 
for deteriorating health, indicative of a limited life expectancy. Here, we 
aimed to describe development of PALLI and to explore its applicability.
METHOD: We used a five-stage mixed-methods procedure to develop PALLI based on 
knowledge from practice. For exploring applicability, professionals caring for 
people with intellectual disabilities completed PALLI for 185 people with 
intellectual disabilities and provided information on applicability after 
5-6 months.
RESULTS: The final version of PALLI included 39 questions relevant for people 
with intellectual disabilities. Applicability was adequate: Most professionals 
found PALLI relevant and reported no ambiguous questions. Added value of PALLI 
was reflecting on and becoming aware of the process of decline in health.
CONCLUSIONS: PALLI shows promising applicability and has potential as a tool for 
timely identifying people with intellectual disabilities who may benefit from 
palliative care.

OBJECTIVES: Investigate the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in 
cancer patients with heart failure (HF); assess factors associated with ischemic 
and non-ischemic HF.
BACKGROUND: Many newer cancer therapies are cardiotoxic; thus, the incidence of 
HF has been increasing in this high-risk patient population. CRT has beneficial 
effects on morbidity, mortality, and left ventricular function in patients with 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, yet cancer patients and survivors who develop 
severe HF and are eligible for CRT often do not receive it.
METHODS: Review of 2 years of echocardiography and electrocardiography data from 
cancer patients.
RESULTS: Of 272 patients meeting inclusion criteria for CRT placement (LVEF 
≤35%, QRS duration ≥120 ms), 131 (48.2%) had HF with ischemic etiology and 141 
(51.8%) had HF with non-ischemic etiology. Most patients had solid tumors, 
including breast, lung, sarcoma, and lymphoma (73.2%, n=199). Only 21.3% 
(58/272; 27 ischemic; 31 non-ischemic) underwent CRT placement, who were mostly 
women and those with solid tumors. Non-ischemic HF was significantly associated 
with younger age (<65 years) (OR=0.91; 95% CI=0.87-0.95) and female sex (OR=2.5; 
95% CI=1.1-6.0). As expected, ischemic HF was significantly associated with 
history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: CRT is underutilized in cancer patients with HF. Most of the cancer 
patients who did not receive CRT had non-ischemic HF secondary to chemotherapy. 
CRT may be less utilized in those patients due to shortened life expectancy, yet 
evidence suggests that CRT has beneficial effects on morbidity, mortality, and 
left ventricular function. Its use may improve patient quality of life and allow 
oncologists to continue cancer treatments that could prolong survival.

The adult population above the age of 60 years has significantly increased in 
India, with a life expectancy of 68.4 years in 2016. Data regarding the renal 
histopathology in these patients are scarce though the number of native kidney 
biopsies done in this subset of population is increasing. The present study is a 
retrospective analysis of 231 biopsies from a total of 700 biopsies, from 
patients above 60 years of age (M = 65.8%; F = 34.2%) with a mean age of 64 ± 
6.03 years. The indications for kidney biopsy included nephrotic syndrome (NS) 
(30.4%), nephritic syndrome (19.1%), rapidly progressive renal failure (11.7%), 
acute kidney injury (AKI) (15.7%), and acute worsening of preexisting chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) (23%). The median percentage of glomerulosclerosis was 22% 
(5%-45%), and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was 30% (10%-50%). The 
most common cause for nephrotic syndrome was membranous nephropathy (31.4%) and 
for nephritic syndrome was benign arterionephrosclerosis (22.7%). Postinfectious 
glomerulonephritis (29.6%) was the leading cause for rapidly progressive renal 
failure. Acute injury on CKD was notable in patients with diabetic nephropathy 
(30.2%). The predominant causes for AKI were acute tubulointerstitial nephritis 
(33.3%), acute tubular necrosis (22.2%), and acute pyelonephritis (19.4%). The 
biopsy proven histopathological features enabled us in tailoring the therapy. 
None of the patients developed life-threatening complications following 
ultrasonography-guided biopsy.

INTRODUCTION: The term multiple primary tumor (MPT) is used to describe cases 
where two or more primary tumors show no histopathological similarities in 
between. Multiple primary tumor cases have begun to increase in recent years as 
a result of the increase in life expectancy because of the increase in life 
standards and progress in diagnostic methods. In this study, MPT cases with 
periampullary tumors that underwent Whipple procedure were discussed in the 
light of literature data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient files of 223 cases with periampullary tumors 
that underwent Whipple procedure in our hospital during the last 6 years were 
examined retrospectively. More than one primary tumor was detected in 21 
patients.
RESULTS: Periampullary carcinomas were detected as a second primary tumor in 18 
patients. First primary tumor was periampullary carcinoma in 3 patients that 
underwent Whipple procedure. After the Whipple procedure, 5 patients died due to 
early complications in the first 30 days and 6 patients died due to metastases 
and additional problems that developed during follow-up.
DISCUSSION: The incidence of MPT has been reported as 0.7 to 14.5% in the 
literature. Most of them are multiple primary case presentations. In patient 
management, it is recommended that each tumor should be evaluated independently 
of its own characteristics, and treatment and follow-up should be planned 
accordingly.
CONCLUSION: The MPT cases are increasing. The possibility of MPT as well as 
metastasis should be kept in mind during the evaluation of tumor foci seen 
during diagnosis and follow-up of patients. The characteristics of each tumor, 
survival, and prognosis should be evaluated separately and the most appropriate 
treatment should be offered to the patient. It is recommended that synchronic 
primary tumors which are considered to be surgically resectable without 
metastasis should be removed in the same session.How to cite this article: Dilek

BACKGROUND: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) have poor 
outcome. Studies on outcome beyond 1 year post-aSAH are few, and late recovery 
is poorly investigated, initiating this prospective outcome study on patients 
12-15 years after an aSAH. We hypothesized to find; functional 
improvement > 1 year post-ictus; increased long-term mortality in aSAH patients 
vs matched controls, and finally to present; predictors of long-term favorable 
outcome (GOS 4-5).
METHODS: We prospectively investigated patients, admitted 2000-2003 to the 
Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 1 year post-ictus using Glasgow Outcome Scale 
(GOS). The patients were revalidated 12-15 years post-aSAH by 
structured-telephone interviews (GOS), followed by statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 158 patients were included, (women n = 114, men n = 44), 
with a mean age of 55 years at aSAH. Patients treated with surgical clipping had 
lower mortality. At the follow-up 12-15 years post-aSAH, all 103 survivors 
(65.2%) were categorized as having; good recovery (39.9%), moderate disability 
(15.2%), or severe disability (10.1%). Within the patient cohort, 23.6% improved 
GOS over time. Fifty-five patients died, median at 4 years post-ictus. aSAH 
patients had 3.5 times increased mortality 12-15 years post-ictus vs matched 
controls (P < .0001). Patients with favorable outcome at 1 year (67.3%, n = 101) 
had similar survival probability as control patients. Prognostic indicators of 
long-term favorable outcome were low age and high GOS at 1-year follow-up, 
(AUCROC, 0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: Individual functional improvement was found >1 year post-ictus. 
Patients with favorable outcome at 1 year had similar long-term life expectancy 
as the general population. Indicators of long-term favorable prognosis were low 
age at ictus and high GOS at 1-year follow-up.

Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is a lysosomal storage disease 
caused by autosomal recessive mutations in ceroid lipofuscinosis 3 (CLN3). 
Children with JNCL experience progressive visual, cognitive, and motor 
deterioration with a decreased life expectancy (late teens-early 20s). Neuronal 
loss is thought to occur, in part, via glutamate excitotoxicity; however, little 
is known about astrocyte glutamate regulation in JNCL. Spontaneous Ca2+ 
oscillations were reduced in murine Cln3Δex7/8 astrocytes, which were also 
observed following glutamate or cytokine exposure. Astrocyte glutamate transport 
is an energy-demanding process and disruptions in metabolic pathways could 
influence glutamate homeostasis in Cln3Δex7/8 astrocytes. Indeed, basal 
mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were significantly reduced in 
Cln3Δex7/8 astrocytes. These changes were not attributable to reduced 
mitochondria, since mitochondrial DNA levels were similar between wild type and 
Cln3Δex7/8 astrocytes. Interestingly, despite these functional deficits in 
Cln3Δex7/8 astrocytes, glutamate transporter expression and glutamate uptake 
were not dramatically affected. Concurrent with impaired astrocyte metabolism 
and Ca2+ signaling, murine Cln3Δex7/8 neurons were hyper-responsive to 
glutamate, as reflected by heightened and prolonged Ca2+ signals. These findings 
identify intrinsic metabolic and Ca2+ signaling defects in Cln3Δex7/8 astrocytes 
that may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in CLN3 disease. This article is 
part of the Special Issue "Lysosomal Storage Disorders".
