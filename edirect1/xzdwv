INTRODUCTION: There is inadequate information on the cost-effectiveness of 
hypertension based on evidence-based guidelines. Therefore, this study was 
conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hypertension treatment based on 
2020 International Society of Hypertension (ISH) guidelines from a societal 
perspective.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition Markov model based on the 
cardiovascular disease policy model adapted to the Sub-Saharan African 
perspective to simulate costs of treated and untreated hypertension and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted by treating previously untreated 
adults above 30 years from a societal perspective for a lifetime.
RESULTS: The full implementation of the ISH 2020 hypertension guidelines can 
prevent approximately 22,348.66 total productive life-year losses annually. The 
incremental net monetary benefit of treating hypertension based was 
$128,520,077.61 US by considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 US 
per DALY averted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of treating 
hypertension when compared with null was $1,125.44 US per DALY averted. Treating 
hypertension among adults aged 40-64 years was very cost-effective 625.27 USD 
per DALY averted. Treating hypertensive adults aged 40-64 years with diabetes 
and CKD is very cost-effective in both women and men (i.e., 559.48 USD and 
905.40 USD/DALY averted respectively).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of the ISH 2020 guidelines among hypertensive 
adults in Southern Ethiopia could result in $9,574,118.47 US economic savings. 
Controlling hypertension in all patients with or with diabetes and or CKD could 
be effective and cost-saving. Therefore, improving treatment coverage, blood 
pressure control rate, and adherence to treatment by involving all relevant 
stakeholders is critical to saving scarce health resources.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The etiology of liver diseases has changed in recent years, 
but its impact on the comparative burden of liver cancer between males and 
females is unclear. We estimated sex differences in the burden of liver cancer 
across 204 countries and territories from 2010 to 2019.
APPROACH AND RESULT: We analyzed temporal trends in the burden of liver cancer 
using the methodology framework of the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study. We 
estimated annual frequencies and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of liver cancer 
incidence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by sex, country, 
region, and etiology of liver disease. Globally in 2019, the frequency of 
incident cases, deaths, and DALYs due to liver cancer were 376,483, 333,672, and 
9,048,723 in males, versus 157,881, 150,904, and 3,479,699 in females. From 2010 
to 2019, the incidence ASRs in males increased while death and DALY ASRs 
remained stable; incidence, death, and DALY ASRs in females decreased. Death 
ASRs for both sexes increased only in the Americas and remained stable or 
declined in remaining regions. In 2019, hepatitis B was the leading cause of 
liver cancer death in males, and hepatitis C in females. From 2010 to 2019, NASH 
had the fastest growing death ASRs in males and females. The ratio of 
female-to-male death ASRs in 2019 was lowest in hepatitis B (0.2) and highest in 
NASH (0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall burden of liver cancer is higher in males, although 
incidence and death ASRs from NASH-associated liver cancer in females approach 
that of males.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe the clinical and cost-effectiveness 
evidence supporting reimbursement decisions of new cancer drugs and analyze the 
influence of trial characteristics and the cost per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) on the likelihood of reimbursement in Sweden.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from all appraisal dossiers for new 
cancer drugs seeking reimbursement in Sweden and claiming added therapeutical 
value between the years 2010 and 2020. The data were analyzed using descriptive 
statistics, and logistic regression models were also used with the cost per 
QALY, study design, comparator, and evidence on final outcomes in the clinical 
trials as predictors of reimbursement.
RESULTS: All 60 included appraisals were based on trial evidence that assessed 
at least one final outcome (overall survival [OS] or quality of life [QoL]), 
although rarely as a primary outcome. Of the appraisals with a final decision 
(n = 58), 79% were approved for reimbursement. Among the reimbursed drugs, only 
half had trial evidence demonstrating improved OS or QoL. Only one drug had 
trial evidence supporting improvements in both OS and QoL. The average cost per 
QALY for reimbursed cancer drugs was estimated to be 748 560 SEK (€73 583). A 
higher cost per QALY was found to decrease the likelihood of reimbursement by 
9.4% for every 100 000 SEK (€9830) higher cost per QALY (P = 0.03). For 
cost-effectiveness models without direct evidence of improvements in final 
outcomes, a larger QALY gain was observed compared with those with evidence 
mainly relying on intermediate and surrogate outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial uncertainties in the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness evidence underlying reimbursement decisions of new cancer 
drugs. Decision makers should be cautious of the limited evidence on 
patient-centered outcomes and the implications of allocating resources to 
expensive treatments with uncertain value for money.

Perceived (or subjective) wellbeing is regarded as key to understanding consumer 
food choices and the development of strategies to promote desirable eating 
habits. Yet, in-depth understanding of the specific factors that contribute to 
people's perceived wellbeing across cultures is lacking. These factors motivated 
the present research that used word associations to conduct an exploratory 
analysis of consumer conceptualisations of food-related wellbeing (WB). Adults 
(n = 4945) living in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore or Germany, and 
speaking respectively, English or German, took part in the study. Health, 
pleasure, food quality, positive emotions and social aspects of food consumption 
were the main associations with food-related wellbeing. Absence hereof was 
associated with unhealthiness, disgust, negative emotions and poor mental 
health. The differences in these main associations emphasised the importance of 
exploring wellbeing, as well as lack hereof. Not doing so leads to an incomplete 
understanding of this multidimensional construct. The research was conducted 
with four terms related to wellbeing (each in their positive and negative 
versions): 'sense of wellbeing' and 'lack of wellbeing', 'feeling good' and 
'feeling bad/unhappy', 'satisfied with life' and 'dissatisfied with life' and 
'fulfilled in life' and 'unfulfilled in life'. Because these different terms 
gave rise to different wellbeing associations, researchers in this area must 
choose their empirical approach with care. The terms 'sense of wellbeing' and 
'feeling good' tended to more frequently give rise to health-related 
associations. Conversely, 'satisfied with life' and 'fulfilled in life' tended 
to more frequently give rise to positive spiritual and emotional associations of 
food-related wellbeing. The main conceptualisations of food-related wellbeing 
were cross-culturally similar, but extension of the present research to other 
Asian countries was recommended based on several differences between Singaporean 
participants and those from other countries. In ethnically diverse countries 
like Singapore, further within-country investigations of different cultures will 
also have merit.

BACKGROUND: Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) testing could increase detection 
of cancer at early stages, when survival outcomes are better and treatment costs 
are lower, but is expected to increase screening costs. This study modeled an 
MCED test for 19 solid cancers in a US population and estimated the potential 
value-based price (the maximum price to meet a given willingness to pay) of the 
MCED test plus current single cancer screening (usual care) compared to usual 
care alone from a third-party payer perspective over a lifetime horizon.
METHODS: A hybrid cohort-level state-transition and decision-tree model was 
developed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of annual MCED testing 
between age 50 and 79 years. The impact on time and stage of diagnosis was 
computed using an interception modeling approach, with the consequences of 
cancer modeled based on stage at diagnosis. The model parameters were mainly 
sourced from the literature, including a published case-control study to inform 
MCED test performance. All costs were inflated to 2021 US dollars.
RESULTS: Multi-cancer early detection testing shifted cancer diagnoses to 
earlier stages, with a 53% reduction in stage IV cancer diagnoses, resulting in 
longer overall survival compared with usual care. Addition of MCED decreased per 
cancer treatment costs by $5421 and resulted in a gain of 0.13 and 0.38 
quality-adjusted life-years across all individuals in the screening program and 
those diagnosed with cancer, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, the potential value-based price 
of an MCED test was estimated at $1196. The projected survival of individuals 
diagnosed with cancer and the number of cancers detected at an earlier stage by 
MCED had the greatest impact on outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: An MCED test with high specificity would potentially improve 
long-term health outcomes and reduce cancer treatment costs, resulting in a 
value-based price of $1196 at a $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year 
willingness-to-pay threshold.

Rapid and sensitive detection of biomarkers enables monitoring patients' health 
status and can enhance the early diagnosis of deadly diseases. In this work, we 
have developed a new colorimetric platform based on spherical nucleic acid (SNA) 
and G-quadruplex DNAzymes for the identification of specific miRNAs. The simple 
hybridization between the target miRNA and two capture probes (capture probe 1 
located at AuNP surface and free capture probe 2) is the working principle of 
this biosensor. The hybridization and duplex formation among probes and miRNAs 
led to a significant decrease in the intensity of color change. A linear 
relationship between the decrease of colorimetric signal and the amount of 
target molecules was witnessed from 1 to 100 nM for miRNA-155. Using this 
method, we were able to detect concentrations of miRNA-155 as low as 0.7 nM. 
Furthermore, the proposed sensing platform can be utilized profitably to detect 
miRNA-155 in real human serum samples. We further investigated the applicability 
of the proposed method in a microfluidic system which displayed promising 
results. In this project, A G-quadruplex based SNAzyme was constructed to 
provide a fast and simple colorimetric method for miRNA detection. The SNAzyme 
actually employed as both target recognition element and catalytic nano labels 
for colorimetric detection.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a medical syndrome that is strongly associated with 
mortality risk and an emerging global health burden. Mental disorders are 
associated with reduced life expectancy and elevated levels of frailty. In this 
study, we examined the mortality risk associated with frailty in individuals 
with a lifetime history of mental disorders compared to individuals without a 
history of mental disorders.
METHODS: The UK Biobank study recruited > 500,000 adults, aged 37-73, between 
2006 and 2010. We derived the two most common albeit distinctive measures of 
frailty, the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. Individuals with lifetime 
depression, bipolar disorder or anxiety disorders were identified from multiple 
data sources. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We have also examined 
differences in frailty, separately by sex and age.
RESULTS: Analyses included up to 297,380 middle-aged and older adults with a 
median follow-up of 12.19 (interquartile range = 1.31) years, yielding 3,516,706 
person-years of follow-up. We observed higher levels of frailty in individuals 
with mental disorders for both frailty measures. Standardised mean differences 
in the frailty index ranged from 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.67) 
in individuals with anxiety disorders to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) in individuals 
with bipolar disorder, compared to people without mental disorders. For key 
comparisons, individuals with a mental disorder had greater all-cause mortality 
hazards than the comparison group without mental disorders. The highest hazard 
ratio (3.65, 95% CI 2.40-5.54) was observed among individuals with bipolar 
disorder and frailty, relative to non-frail individuals without mental 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight elevated levels of frailty across three 
common mental disorders. Frailty and mental disorders represent potentially 
modifiable targets for prevention and treatment to improve population health and 
life expectancy, especially where both conditions coexist.

The Covid-19 pandemic inaugurated a new global order of public life and health 
marked by death, despair and alienation. As a crisis of a global scale, it made 
the task of (re)imagination simultaneously necessary and extremely difficult. It 
is this double bind of the difficulty and imminence of imagination that 
motivates the curation of this special issue. In this introduction, we map the 
connections between the theme of this volume and the key ideas that constitute 
its varied contributions, which we organised under three broad mobilising ideas: 
Rights and Resilience; Sexuality, Health and Justice; and Politics of Knowledge 
Production and Collaborations. Contributions cover myriad issues, engage in 
methodological innovations and play with diverse genres. Alongside more 
traditional academic writings, there are community-based research papers, 
activist conversations, visual essays, reflective pieces and interviews. The 
geographical span of the contributions brings insights from around the world and 
the number of topics covered in this issue are equally vast including, among 
others, mental health, disability, environment, sex work, violence, queerness, 
LGBTQ+ experiences, love and anger. The aim of this special issue, then, is to 
challenge the Manichean distinctions that are often drawn between research and 
activism, and by extension, between theory and practice.

BACKGROUND: Globally, about 1.8 million adolescents between the ages of 10 and 
19 were living with HIV by close of 2021, of these, about 1.5 million were 
living in sub-Saharan Africa. This study explored the influence of mass media 
campaigns in promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapies among adolescents 
living with HIV in southwestern Uganda.
METHODS: We conducted a phenomenological qualitative study design that was 
adopted to explore the role of mass media campaigns on adherence to 
antiretroviral therapy among adolescents at the adolescents' HIV clinic Mbarara 
Regional Referral Hospital. The FGDs were conducted in Runyankole-Rukiga, and 
they were transcribed verbatim and later translated to English. Data were 
analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: We conducted 7 Focus Group Discussions with adolescents living with HIV 
aged 10-19 years and 5 key informants' interviews with the health care 
providers. Results from the analysis were grouped into three broad themes: 
awareness of mass media HIV campaigns promoting adherence to ART, influence of 
mass media campaigns on adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and preferred mass 
media mode of delivery by adolescents' living with HIV. Participants preferred 
broadcast media channels and messages that featured success stories of people 
living with HIV.
CONCLUSION: HIV mass media campaigns influence adherence to antiretroviral 
therapy among people living with HIV. It is recommended that HIV-related media 
campaign designers consider the unique needs of adolescents while designing and 
airing out various media campaigns. This will influence their positive living 
and thus lead to their increased health life expectancy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ICU bed shortages sparked a discussion about 
resource allocation. We aimed to analyse the value of ICU treatment of COVID-19 
from a patient-centred health economic perspective. We prospectively included 49 
patients with severe COVID-19 and calculated direct medical treatment costs. 
Quality of life was converted into aggregated quality-adjusted life years using 
the statistical remaining life expectancy. Costs for non-treatment as the 
comparator were estimated using the value of statistical life year approach. We 
used multivariable linear or logistic regression to identify predictors of 
treatment costs, quality of life and survival. Mean (SD) direct medical 
treatment costs were higher in patients in ICU with COVID-19 compared with those 
without (£60,866 (£42,533) vs. £8282 (£14,870), respectively; p &lt; 0.001). 
This was not solely attributable to prolonged ICU length of stay, as costs per 
day were also higher (£3115 (£1374) vs. £1490 (£713), respectively; 
p &lt; 0.001), independent of overall disease severity. We observed a beneficial 
cost-utility value of £7511 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, even with a 
more pessimistic assumption towards the remaining life expectancy. 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy provided no additional 
quality-adjusted life-year benefit. Compared with non-treatment (costs per lost 
life year, £106,085), ICU treatment (costs per quality-adjusted life-year, 
£7511) was economically preferable, even with a pessimistic interpretation of 
patient preferences for survival (sensitivity analysis of the value of 
statistical life year, £48,848). Length of ICU stay was a positive and 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a negative predictor for quality of life, 
whereas costs per day were a positive predictor for mortality. These data 
suggest that despite high costs, ICU treatment for severe COVID-19 may be 
cost-effective for quality-adjusted life-years gained.

Childhood obesity is a growing concern, because the problem affects a high 
percentage of children and is the source of many diseases in the present and in 
the future, which can lead to a decrease in life expectancy and quality of life. 
In order to combat the problem, it is necessary to analyze the factors 
associated with excess weight in childhood in order to act on them and try to 
curb the trend observed in recent years. Various socio-demographic aspects, as 
well as inactivity and sedentary lifestyle in children are factors that are 
associated with an increased risk of obesity and central adiposity. With great 
prominence in this issue, we have to highlight that the consumption of food is 
improvable: decrease the consumption of sugar, fat and sodium, and above all 
increase the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, dairy is 
associated with lower obesity and central obesity in children. There is no 
single responsible for the problem and the interaction between healthy behaviors 
increases the chances of success in the fight against childhood obesity, which 
should be considered when planning nutritional education campaigns. Many aspects 
of the diet and lifestyle of the child population must be improved, perhaps now 
more emphasis is being placed on restrictive guidelines. Of course, it is 
desirable to reduce the consumption of sweets and snacks, but messages aimed at 
increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and approximating 
the diet to the theoretical ideal can be prioritized. Constructive guidelines 
should stand out from restrictive ones.

Publisher: La obesidad infantil es objeto de preocupación creciente, porque el 
problema afecta a un elevado porcentaje de niños y es el origen de numerosas 
enfermedades en el presente y en el futuro, pudiendo condicionar un descenso en 
la esperanza y calidad de vida. Para combatir el problema es necesario analizar 
los factores que se asocian con el exceso de peso en la infancia para actuar 
sobre ellos e intentar frenar la tendencia observada en los últimos años. 
Diversos aspectos sociodemográficos, así como la inactividad y el sedentarismo 
de los niños son factores que se asocian con mayor riesgo de padecimiento de 
obesidad y adiposidad central. Con gran protagonismo en este tema debe 
destacarse que el consumo de alimentos es mejorable: disminuir el consumo de 
azúcar, grasa y sodio, y sobre todo aumentar el consumo de frutas, verduras, 
cereales integrales, pescado, lácteos se asocia con menor padecimiento de 
obesidad y obesidad central en los niños. Pero no hay un único responsable del 
problema y la interacción entre conductas saludables aumenta las posibilidades 
de éxito en la lucha contra la obesidad infantil, lo que debe ser considerado al 
planificar campañas de educación nutricional. Se deben mejorar numerosos 
aspectos de la alimentación y estilo de vida de la población infantil, quizá en 
este momento se hace más hincapié en pautas restrictivas, aunque es muy 
conveniente reducir el consumo de dulces y snacks, resulta muy deseable y quizá 
prioritario el aumentar el consumo de verduras, hortalizas, frutas, cereales 
integrales y aproximar la dieta al ideal teórico. Las pautas constructivas 
deberían destacar respecto a las restrictivas.

Wearable payment devices (WPD) are gaining acceptance fast and transforming 
everyday life and commercial operations in China. Limited research works were 
conducted on customers' adoption intentions to obtain a real image of the 
evolution of WPD in China. This study aims to investigate the effects of 
Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), 
Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Perceived Trust (PT), and 
Lifestyle Compatibility (LC) on the intention to adopt WPD among Chinese 
consumers by expanding unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with 
two impelling determinants (i.e. PT and LC). Using an online survey, empirical 
data were collected from 298 respondents in China. In a two-stage data analysis, 
partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) were employed to 
analyse the causal effects and associations between independent and dependent 
variables, whereas artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to evaluate the 
research model prediction capability. The (PLS-SEM) findings indicated that PE, 
SI, FC, HM, LC, and PT had substantial positive impacts on adoption intention, 
whilst EE had no impact on adoption intention among Chinese consumers. The ANN 
analysis proved the high prediction accuracy of data fitness, with ANN findings 
highlighting the importance of PT, FC, and PE on the intention to adopt WPD. It 
was suggested that the study findings assist WPD service providers and the smart 
wearable device industry practitioners in developing innovative products and 
implementing efficient marketing strategies to attract the existing and 
potential WPD users in China.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a disease that shortens life expectancy and predisposes 
to many diseases such as severe hepatosteatosis. Hepatosteatosis is 
characterized by inflammatory infiltration of the portal space. Bariatric 
surgery has improvement effect on hepatosteatosis and degree of inflammation. 
Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is an effective and most common therapeutic 
option for obesity. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is a parameter associated with 
inflammatory disease. This study aimed to investigate if there is any 
correlation between improvements in hepatosteatosis and biochemical parameters 
especially neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and ultrasonographic findings 1 year 
after the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.
METHODS: The files of 66 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 
between May 2017 and April 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative and 
postoperative 1-year demographic data, biochemical and inflammatory parameters, 
and ultrasonographic reports of the liver were reviewed.
RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in hepatosteatosis was 
demonstrated by ultrasonography 1 year after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. A 
significant decrease was also observed in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. No 
correlation was found between the decrease of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and 
improvement in hepatosteatosis. There was also significant difference between 
the preoperative and postoperative BMI, biochemical and inflammatory parameters.
CONCLUSION: However, we found laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is associated with 
significant improvement in hepatosteatosis and inflammatory parameters; no 
correlation between the improvement in hepatosteatosis and NLR was seen at 1 
year.

BACKGROUND: Ground-level falls (GLFs) in older adults are increasing as life 
expectancy increases, and more patients are being discharged to skilled nursing 
facilities (SNFs) for continuity of care. However, GLF patients are not a 
homogenous cohort, and the role of frailty remains to be assessed. Thus, the aim 
of this study is to examine the impact of frailty on the in-hospital and 30-day 
outcomes of GLF patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cohort analysis from the Nationwide 
Readmissions Database 2017. Geriatric (age ≥65 years) trauma patients presenting 
following GLFs were identified and grouped based on their frailty status. The 
associations between frailty and 30-day mortality and emergency readmission were 
examined by multivariate regression analyses adjusting for patient demographics 
and injury characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 100,850 geriatric GLF patients were identified (frail: 41% 
vs. non-frail: 59%). Frail GLF patients were younger (81[74-87] vs. 83[76-89] 
years; p<0.001) and less severely injured-Injury Severity Score [ISS] (4[1-9] 
vs. 5[2-9]; p<0.001). Frail patients had a higher index mortality (2.9% vs. 
1.9%; p<0.001) and higher 30-day readmissions (14.0% vs. 9.8%; p<0.001). 
Readmission mortality was also higher in the frail group (15.2% vs. 10.9%; 
p<0.001), with 75.2% of those patients readmitted from an SNF. On multivariate 
analysis, frailty was associated with 30-day mortality (OR 1.75; p<0.001) and 
30-day readmission (OR 1.49; p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Frail geriatric patients are at 75% higher odds of mortality and 49% 
higher odds of readmission following GLFs. Of those readmitted on an emergency 
basis, more than one in seven patients died, 75% of whom were readmitted from an 
SNF. This underscores the need for optimization plans that extend to the 
post-discharge period to reduce readmissions and subsequent high-impact 
consequences.

Preserving attention abilities is of great concern to older adults who are 
motivated to maintain their quality of life. Both cognitive and physical fitness 
interventions have been utilized in intervention studies to assess maintenance 
and enhancement of attention abilities in seniors, and a coupling of these 
approaches is a compelling strategy to buttress both cognitive and physical 
health in a time- and resource-effective manner. With this perspective, we 
created a closed-loop, motion-capture video game (Body-Brain Trainer: BBT) that 
adapts a player's cognitive and physical demands in an integrated approach, thus 
creating a personalized and cohesive experience across both domains. Older 
adults who engaged in two months of BBT improved on both physical fitness 
(measures of blood pressure and balance) and attention (behavioral and neural 
metrics of attention on a continuous performance task) outcome measures beyond 
that of an expectancy matched, active, placebo control group, with maintenance 
of improved attention performance evidenced 1 year later. Following training, 
the BBT group's improvement on the attention outcome measure exceeded 
performance levels attained by an untrained group of 20-year olds, and showed 
age-equilibration of a neural signature of attention shown to decline with age: 
midline frontal theta power. These findings highlight the potential benefits of 
an integrated, cognitive-physical, closed-loop training platform as a powerful 
tool for both cognitive and physical enhancement in older adults.

BACKGROUND: The equality in the distribution of vaccines between and within 
countries along with follow sanitation tips and observe social distance, are 
effective strategies to rid the world of COVID-19 pandemic. Inequality in the 
distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to causing inequity to the 
population health, has a significant impact on the process of economic recovery.
METHODS: All published original papers on the inequality of Covid-19 vaccine 
distribution and the factors affecting it were searched in PubMed, Web of 
Science, Scopus and ProQuest databases between December 2020 to 30 May 2022. 
Selection of articles, extraction of their data and qualitative assessment (by 
STROBE) were performed by two researchers separately. Data graphing form was 
used to extract detailed data from each study and then, the collected data were 
classified.
RESULTS: A total of 4623 articles were evaluated. After removing duplicates and 
screening the title, abstract and full text of articles, 22 articles were 
selected and entered into the study. Fifteen (68.17%) studies were conducted in 
the United States, three (13.64%) in Europe, three (13.64%) in Asia and one 
(6.66%) in Oceania. Factors affecting the inequality in the distribution of 
COVID-19 vaccine were classified into macro and micro levels determinants.
CONCLUSION: Macro determinants of inequality in the Covid-19 vaccine 
distribution were consisted of economic (stability and country's economic 
status, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, financial support and human 
development index), infrastructure and health system (appropriate information 
system, functional cold chains in vaccine transport, transport infrastructure, 
medical and non-medical facilities per capita, healthcare access and quality), 
legal and politics (vaccination allocation rules, health policies, political 
ideology and racial bias), and epidemiologic and demographic factors (Covid-19 
incidence and deaths rate, life expectancy, vulnerability to Covid-19, working 
in medical setting, comorbidities, social vulnerability, incarceration and 
education index). Moreover, micro/ individual level factors were included in 
economic (household's income, home ownership, employment, poverty, access to 
healthy food and residency in the deprived areas) and demographic and social 
characteristics (sex, age, race, ethnic, religion, disability, location 
(urban/rural) and insurance coverage).

BACKGROUND: Approximately 45% of all under-five child deaths are among newborn 
infants, babies in their first 28 days of life, or the neonatal period every 
year in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region. To facilitate the 
achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2, innovative interventions 
are needed to address this challenge. Thus, this scoping review aims to map 
research evidence on perinatal asphyxia among neonates in the WHO Africa Region.
METHODS: This scoping review will be guided by the Arksey and O'Malley 
framework, Levac et al. recommendations, and the Joanna Briggs Institute 
checklist for scoping reviews. Relevant published literature will be searched 
using a combination of keywords, Boolean terms, and Medical Subject Headings in 
the following databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Web of Science from January 
2016 onwards. We will further search the World Health Organization and 
government websites, as well as the reference list of included studies for 
potentially eligible studies. This scoping review will include research evidence 
involving countries in the WHO Africa Region, with a focus on the burden of 
perinatal asphyxia, contributory/associated factors of perinatal asphyxia, 
clinical interventions for perinatal asphyxia, and interventions/strategies for 
the prevention of perinatal asphyxia in the SDGs era. Two reviewers will 
independently sort the studies to include and exclude, guided by the eligibility 
criteria. Also, the data from the included studies will be extracted and any 
discrepancies resolved using a third reviewer. Thematic analysis will be 
conducted, and the findings reported using both qualitative tables and figures. 
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension 
for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) will be followed to report this study's results. 
Quality appraisal of the included studies will be done utilising the mixed 
methods appraisal tool version 2018.
CONCLUSION: This scoping review results may reveal research evidence gaps to 
inform future primary studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses; and 
possibly contribute towards the realisation of the SDG 3.2 by countries in the 
WHO Africa Region. The finding of this review will be disseminated using 
multiple channels such as workshops, peer review publications, conferences, and 
social media.

Although recent progress in medicine has substantially reduced cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs)-related mortalities, current therapeutics have failed miserably 
to be beneficial for all patients with CVDs. A wide array of evidence suggests 
that newly-introduced cell-free treatments (CFTs) have more reliable results in
