The purpose of this study was to estimate the economic burden of violence 
against children in South Africa. We assembled summative estimates of lifetime 
prevalence, calculated the magnitude of associations with negative outcomes, and 
thereby estimated the economic burden of violence against children. According to 
our calculations, 2.3 million and 84,287 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
lost in South Africa in 2015 were attributable to nonfatal and fatal violence 
against children, respectively. The estimated economic value of DALYs lost to 
violence against children (including both fatal and nonfatal) in South Africa in 
2015 totalled ZAR173 billion (US $13.5 billion)-or 4.3% of South Africa's gross 
domestic product (GDP) in 2015. In addition, the reduced earnings attributable 
to childhood physical violence and emotional violence in South Africa in 2015 
were ZAR25.2 billion (US $2.0 billion) and ZAR9.6 billion (US $750 million), 
respectively. In addition, South Africa spent ZAR1.6 billion (US $124 million) 
on child care and protection in fiscal year 2015/2016, many of which costs are 
directly related to violence against children. This study confirms the 
importance of prioritising violence against children as a key social and 
economic concern for South Africa's future.

BACKGROUND: Frailty predisposes individuals to a variety of complications. 
However, there is no consensus on the definition of frailty.
OBJECTIVES: To examine whether various frailty measures are equivalent in 
identifying the same individuals as being frail and whether the measures also 
predict similar outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Helsinki Businessmen Study cohort, which 
is a long-term observational study of men born in 1919-1934, was used as the 
population. We investigated these men by their postal questionnaire responses in 
2000 and 2005. The mean age of the men (N=480) was 73 years at the start of 
follow-up.
MEASUREMENTS: We compared two phenotypic frailty measures, the Helsinki 
Businessmen Study measure (HBS), the modified Women's Health Initiative 
Observational Study (WHI-OS), and the Frailty Index (FI) comprising 20 items. 
All three measurements were applied to Helsinki Businessmen Study cohort data 
collected via simple postal questionnaire from 480 men. We investigated how 
effectively these three measures distinguished between the not frail, prefrail, 
and frail individuals, and predicted mortality, falls, weight change, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL, 15D instrument) during a 5-year 
follow-up.
RESULTS: The HBS and the modified WHI-OS identified 35 persons (7.3%) each as 
frail but their respective sets comprised different groupings of individuals 
that partly overlapped. The FI identified 86 persons (17.9%) as frail. 
One-hundred-and-two (21.3%) men were classified as frail by at least one of the 
measures. All three measures significantly predicted higher mortality, higher 
number of fallers, and lower HRQoL for frail participants. None of the measures 
showed different results for weight change between the frailty groups or frailty 
stages.
CONCLUSIONS: All three measures identified somewhat different sets of 
participants as frail. They all predicted increased mortality, falls and reduced 
HRQoL for the frail groups.

BACKGROUND: Imatinib and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
nilotinib and dasatinib have statistically significantly improved the life 
expectancy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients; however, resistance to 
TKIs remains a major clinical challenge. Although ponatinib, a third-generation 
TKI, improves outcomes for patients with BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms of 
resistance, including the T315I mutation, a proportion of patients may have or 
develop BCR-ABL-independent resistance and fail ponatinib treatment. By modeling 
ponatinib resistance and testing samples from these CML patients, it is hoped 
that an alternative drug target can be identified and inhibited with a novel 
compound.
METHODS: Two CML cell lines with acquired BCR-ABL-independent resistance were 
generated following culture in ponatinib. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) 
enrichment were used to detect aberrant transcriptional response in 
ponatinib-resistant cells. A validated oncogene drug library was used to 
identify US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with activity against 
TKI-resistant cells. Validation was performed using bone marrow (BM)-derived 
cells from TKI-resistant patients (n = 4) and a human xenograft mouse model 
(n = 4-6 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: We show that ponatinib-resistant CML cells can acquire 
BCR-ABL-independent resistance mediated through alternative activation of mTOR. 
Following transcriptomic analysis and drug screening, we highlight mTOR 
inhibition as an alternative therapeutic approach in TKI-resistant CML cells. 
Additionally, we show that catalytic mTOR inhibitors induce autophagy and 
demonstrate that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy sensitizes 
ponatinib-resistant CML cells to death induced by mTOR inhibition in vitro (% 
number of colonies of control[SD], NVP-BEZ235 vs NVP-BEZ235+HCQ: 45.0[17.9]% vs 
24.0[8.4]%, P = .002) and in vivo (median survival of NVP-BEZ235- vs 
NVP-BEZ235+HCQ-treated mice: 38.5 days vs 47.0 days, P = .04).
CONCLUSION: Combined mTOR and autophagy inhibition may provide an attractive 
approach to target BCR-ABL-independent mechanism of resistance.

The purpose of present study was to examine the association between ACTN3 R577X 
genotype and functional characteristics of elbow flexors before and after 
isokinetic eccentric contractions (ECCs). Fifty-two men (age: 20.8±3.8 years, 
height: 172.5±5.9 cm, body mass: 64.7±6.5 kg, BMI: 21.7±1.7) who had not 
participated in any regular resistance training for at least 1 year prior to 
this study were recruited. ECCs consisted of five sets of six maximal voluntary 
isokinetic (30°/s) ECCs of the elbow flexors with a range of motion (ROM) from 
90° flexion to 0° (full extension). Measurements of maximal voluntary isometric 
contraction (MVC) torque, ROM, and muscle soreness were taken before, 
immediately after, and 1, 2, 3, and 5 days after ECCs. Genotyping results were 
analyzed for identifying ACTN3 R577X polymorphism (rs1815739) using TaqMan 
approach. The genotype frequencies of the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism were RR 26.9% 
(n=14), RX 50.0% (n=26), and XX 23.1% (n=12). There were no significant 
differences in MVC torque, ROM, and soreness between three genotype groups of 
ACTN3 R577X. However, MVC at baseline was greater in RR homozygotes than in 
X-allele carriers (combined XX and RX; p<0.05). ROM in RR homozygotes at 
baseline was lower than that of X-allele carriers. Although a significant 
decrease in ROM was observed in X-allele carriers until 3 days after ECCs, a 
significant ROM reduction in RR homozygotes was observed only immediately after 
ECCs. Our data indicated that ACTN3 RR genotype has higher MVC and lower 
flexibility than X-allele carriers at baseline, but the effect of ACTN3 R577X 
genotype on these two parameters is limited after ECCs.

The endangered Burmese brow antlered deer (Rucervus eldii thamin) is a medium 
sized tropical cervid kept in a number of European zoos. Studbook data and 
anecdotal reports have suggested that this species suffers from poor 
reproductive success and relatively high neonatal mortality in captivity. 
Questionnaires were sent to 10 European zoos, holding 91 (20.71.0) deer, in 
order to record information on husbandry practices and enclosure design. 
Studbook analysis was performed to determine reproductive success and mortality 
values at each of the zoos participating in the study. Statistical analysis was 
carried out to identify any links between husbandry or enclosure design and the 
population parameters calculated from the studbook. From the nine zoos that were 
analyzed in this study, no significant differences were found for population 
parameters between male and female deer. Neonatal mortality was negatively 
correlated to enclosure size (in males) and enclosure cover (in females). 
Positive correlations were found between enclosure cover, average temperature 
and group size with life expectancy, and negative correlations between enclosure 
visibility and visitor distance with female life expectancy. These results may 
be useful for informing husbandry guidelines, although further research into 
stress responses in captivity is recommended for this species to improve their 
welfare.

CDC Grand Rounds: Improving the Lives of Persons with Sickle Cell Disease.

Hulihan M, Hassell KL, Raphael JL, Smith-Whitley K, Thorpe P.

Approximately 100,000 Americans have sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of 
recessively inherited red blood cell disorders characterized by abnormal 
hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin, in the red blood cells. 
Persons with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin Sß0 thalassemia, also known as sickle 
cell anemia (SCA), have the most severe form of SCD. Hemoglobin SC disease and 
hemoglobin Sß+ thalassemia are other common forms of SCD. Red blood cells that 
contain sickle hemoglobin are inflexible and can stick to vessel walls, causing 
a blockage that slows or stops blood flow. When this happens, oxygen cannot 
reach nearby tissues, leading to attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain 
crises, which are the clinical hallmark of SCD. The red cell sickling and poor 
oxygen delivery can also cause damage to the brain, spleen, eyes, lungs, liver, 
and multiple other organs and organ systems. These chronic complications can 
lead to increased morbidity, early mortality, or both. Tremendous strides in 
treating and preventing the complications of SCD have extended life expectancy. 
Now, nearly 95% of persons born with SCD in the United States reach age 18 years 
(1); however, adults with the most severe forms of SCD have a life span that is 
20-30 years shorter than that of persons without SCD (2).

OBJECTIVE: To describe the sample plan, operational aspects, and strategies used 
in the 2009/2010 and 2013/2014 EpiFloripa Aging Study.
METHODS: The EpiFloripa Aging is a population-based longitudinal study with 
1,705 older adults (60 years or more) living in the municipality of 
Florianópolis, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 2009/2010 (baseline). The 
research was conducted with a face-to-face interviews, organized into blocks of 
identification, socioeconomic, mental health, health and life habits, global 
functionality, falls, physical activity, morbidities, use of health services, 
use of medications, food, oral health, and violence, evaluated in the first 
(2009/2010) and in the second wave (2013/2014). Additionally, in the second 
wave, we investigated the issue of discrimination and quality of life.
RESULTS: The response rate of the first wave was 89.2% (n = 1,705). The baseline 
sample, with predominance of women (63.9%), was similar to the 2010 Census 
regarding age for women and slightly different for younger men. In the second 
wave, 1,197 participants were interviewed (response rate of 70.3%). Follow-up 
losses were only observed for the variable age group (p = 0.003), and 
predominantly for those aged 80 years or more. Mortality data linkage and active 
search for participants were used as a follow-up strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study used strategies that were able to help locate the 
participants and maintain adherence, which ensured a good response rate during 
investigations.

OBJETIVO: Descrever o plano amostral, aspectos operacionais e estratégias 
utilizadas no Estudo EpiFloripa Idoso 2009/2010 e 2013/2014.
MÉTODOS: O EpiFloripa Idoso é um estudo de base populacional com 1.705 idosos 
(60 anos ou mais) residentes no município de Florianópolis, SC, em 2009/2010 
(linha de base). A investigação foi realizada por meio de entrevista face a 
face, organizada nos blocos de identificação, geral (características 
socioeconômicas), saúde mental, saúde e hábitos de vida, funcionalidade global, 
quedas, atividade física, morbidades, uso de serviços de saúde, uso de 
medicamentos, alimentação, saúde bucal e violência, avaliados na primeira 
(2009/2010) e na segunda onda (2013/2014). Adicionalmente, na segunda onda, 
investigou-se a temática de discriminação e qualidade de vida.
RESULTADOS: A taxa de resposta na primeira onda foi de 89,2% (n = 1.705). A 
amostra da linha de base, com predomínio de mulheres (63,9%), foi semelhante ao 
Censo 2010 em relação à idade nas mulheres e ligeiramente diferente nos homens 
mais jovens. Na segunda onda, 1.197 participantes foram entrevistados (taxa de 
resposta de 70,3%). Houve perda de seguimento somente para a variável faixa 
etária (p=0,003), principalmente naqueles com 80 anos ou mais. Utilizou-se como 
estratégias de seguimento o relacionamento de dados e a busca ativa.
CONCLUSÕES: O presente estudo utilizou estratégias que conseguiram auxiliar na 
localização dos participantes e manutenção da aderência, o que garantiu boa taxa 
de resposta durante as investigações.

BACKGROUND: We analysed hospital admissions of a predominantly Aboriginal cohort 
of children in the remote Fitzroy Valley in Western Australia during the first 7 
years of life.
METHODS: All children born between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and 
living in the Fitzroy Valley in 2009-2010 were eligible to participate in the 
Lililwan Project. Of 134 eligible children, 127 (95%) completed Stage 1 
(interviews of caregivers and medical record review) in 2011 and comprised our 
cohort. Lifetime (0-7 years) hospital admission data were available and included 
the dates, and reasons for admission, and comorbidities. Conditions were coded 
using ICD-10-AM discharge codes.
RESULTS: Of the 127 children, 95.3% were Indigenous and 52.8% male. There were 
314 admissions for 424 conditions in 89 (70.0%) of 127 children. The 89 children 
admitted had a median of five admissions (range 1-12). Hospitalization rates 
were similar for both genders (p = 0.4). Of the admissions, 108 (38.6%) were for 
56 infants aged <12 months (median = 2.5, range = 1-8). Twelve of these 
admissions were in neonates (aged 0-28 days). Primary reasons for admission 
(0-7 years) were infections of the lower respiratory tract (27.4%), 
gastrointestinal system (22.7%), and upper respiratory tract (11.4%), injury 
(7.0%), and failure to thrive (5.4%). Comorbidities, particularly upper 
respiratory tract infections (18.1%), failure to thrive (13.6%), and anaemia 
(12.7%), were common. In infancy, primary cause for admission were infections of 
the lower respiratory tract (40.8%), gastrointestinal (25.9%) and upper 
respiratory tract (9.3%). Comorbidities included upper respiratory tract 
infections (33.3%), failure to thrive (18.5%) and anaemia (18.5%).
CONCLUSION: In the Fitzroy Valley 70.0% of children were hospitalised at least 
once before age 7 years and over one third of admissions were in infants. 
Infections were the most common reason for admission in all age groups but 
comorbidities were common and may contribute to need for admission. Many 
hospitalizations were feasibly preventable. High admission rates reflect 
disadvantage, remote location and limited access to primary healthcare and 
outpatient services. Ongoing public health prevention initiatives including 
breast feeding, vaccination, healthy diet, hygiene and housing improvements are 
crucial, as is training of Aboriginal Health Workers to increase services in 
remote communities.

BACKGROUND: Reliable data on cause of death (COD) are fundamental for planning 
and resource allocation priorities. We used GBD 2015 estimates to examine levels 
and trends for the leading causes of death in Brazil from 1990 to 2015.
METHODS: We describe the main analytical approaches focused on both overall and 
specific causes of death for Brazil and Brazilian states.
RESULTS: There was an overall improvement in life expectancy at birth from 1990 
to 2015, but with important heterogeneity among states. Reduced mortality due to 
diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, and other infectious diseases 
contributed the most for increasing life expectancy in most states from the 
North and Northeast regions. Reduced mortality due to cardiovascular diseases 
was the highest contributor in the South, Southeast, and Center West regions. 
However, among men, intentional injuries reduced life expectancy in 17 out of 27 
states. Although age-standardized rates due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and 
cerebrovascular disease declined over time, these remained the leading CODs in 
the country and states. In contrast, leading causes of premature mortality 
changed substantially - e.g., diarrheal diseases moved from 1st to 13th and then 
the 36th position in 1990, 2005, and 2015, respectively, while violence moved 
from 7th to 1st and to 2nd. Overall, the total age-standardized years of life 
lost (YLL) rate was reduced from 1990 to 2015, bringing the burden of premature 
deaths closer to expected rates given the country's Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI). In 1990, IHD, stroke, diarrhea, neonatal preterm birth complications, 
road injury, and violence had ratios higher than the expected, while in 2015 
only violence was higher, overall and in all states, according to the SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: A widespread reduction of mortality levels occurred in Brazil from 
1990 to 2015, particularly among children under 5 years old. Major shifts in 
mortality rates took place among communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional disorders. The mortality profile has shifted to older ages with 
increases in non-communicable diseases as well as premature deaths due to 
violence. Policymakers should address health interventions accordingly.

Medicine Availability and Prescribing Policy for Non-Communicable Diseases in 
the Western Balkan Countries.

University of East Sarajevo, East Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

BACKGROUND: During the transition processes, the Western Balkan countries were 
affected by conflicts and transition-related changes. Life expectancy in these 
countries is lower, while the mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is 
higher in comparison with western and northern parts of Europe. The primary aim 
of this study was to analyze the treatment possibilities for the most common 
NCDs in the Western Balkan countries. The secondary aim was to understand and 
compare the policies regarding prescribing-related competencies of family 
physicians.
METHODS: In June and July 2017, a document analysis was performed of national 
positive medicines lists, strategic documents, and clinical guidelines for the 
treatment of the most frequent NCDs; arterial hypertension, diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). All 
text phrases that referred to medicines prescribing were extracted and sorted 
into following domains: medicine availability, prescribing policy, and 
medication prescribing-related competencies.
RESULTS: Possibilities for treatment of arterial hypertension, diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, asthma, and COPD vary across the Western Balkan countries. This 
variance is reflected in the number of registered medicines, number of 
parallels, and number of different combinations, as well as restrictions placed 
on family physicians in prescribing insulin, inhaled corticosteroids, statins 
and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), without consultant's 
recommendation.
CONCLUSION: Western Balkan countries are capable of providing essential 
medicines for the treatment of NCDs, with full or partial reimbursement. There 
are some exceptions, related to statins, newer generation of oral antidiabetic 
agents and some of the antihypertensive combinations. Prescribing-related 
competences of family physicians are limited. However, this practice is not 
compliant to the practices of family medicine, its principles and primary care 
structures, and may potentially result in increased health-care financial 
ramifications to both the system and patients due to frequent referrals to the 
specialists.

IMPORTANCE: The 2012 international consensus guidelines defined a subcategory of 
pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with “worrisome 
features,” which may be followed with close surveillance. However, given the 
poor prognosis of invasive malignancy, the role of early, upfront resection 
requires further investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the utility of upfront resection vs long-term 
surveillance. We hypothesized that surveillance of these cystic neoplasms would 
offer greater long-term utility.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov decision analysis model was 
constructed to estimate and compare 2 management strategies: early resection and 
long-term surveillance. Estimates for the utility of outcomes, probabilities of 
transitions between disease states, and probabilities of surgical morbidity were 
derived from a literature review of articles published between 1997 and 2014. 
The comparative effectiveness model’s variable estimates were based on data 
published predominantly by high-volume, tertiary referral centers. Model 
probability variable estimates were derived from large, retrospective, 
single-institution reports. For utility variables, estimates derived from 
studies using standard-gamble or time-tradeoff methods were given greater 
weight.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Expected utility was measured in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years using 3% annual discount. Probabilistic and 1-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the potential effects of 
uncertainty in estimates of key model variables.
RESULTS: Early resection yielded 11.63 quality-adjusted life-years during 20 
years of follow-up compared with 11.06 for surveillance. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicated that resection has a 94% likelihood of being more 
effective than surveillance. Early resection obtained greater utility only if 
each of the following criteria are met: life expectancy is at least 18 years, 
surgical mortality is less than 4.3%, and baseline preoperative utility is at 
least 0.78. Additional drivers of the model outcomes include the rate of 
progression from worrisome to high-risk features and the likelihood of finding 
cancer on resection for neoplasms with high-risk stigmata.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early resection compares favorably with surveillance 
in the management of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with 
worrisome features. However, careful consideration of patient factors and 
surgeon outcomes is imperative.

QUESTION: For patients with pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms with worrisome features, does early resection or long-term 
surveillance result in greater overall utility?
FINDINGS: In this comparative effectiveness study, based on a comparative 
effectiveness Markov model, early resection offered greater overall utility than 
long-term surveillance for branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms 
with worrisome features. Selection for surgery depends on specific patient, 
surgeon, and neoplasm characteristics.
MEANING: Early resection should be considered for branch duct intraductal 
papillary mucinous neoplasms with worrisome features.

This comparative effectiveness study compares the utility of upfront resection 
vs long-term surveillance in treatment of pancreatic branch duct intraductal 
papillary mucinous neoplasms with worrisome features.

The objective of the paper is to assess the cost-effectiveness of targeted 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis based on a validated prediction 
rule with 1-year time horizon in moderately preterm infants compared to no 
prophylaxis. Data on health care consumption were derived from a randomised 
clinical trial on wheeze reduction following RSV prophylaxis and a large birth 
cohort study on risk prediction of RSV hospitalisation. We calculated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of targeted RSV prophylaxis vs. no 
prophylaxis per quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) using a societal perspective, 
including medical and parental costs and effects. Costs and health outcomes were 
modelled in a decision tree analysis with sensitivity analyses. Targeted RSV 
prophylaxis in infants with a first-year RSV hospitalisation risk of > 10% 
resulted in a QALY gain of 0.02 (0.931 vs. 0.929) per patient against additional 
cost of €472 compared to no prophylaxis (ICER €214,748/QALY). The ICER falls 
below a threshold of €80,000 per QALY when RSV prophylaxis cost would be lowered 
from €928 (baseline) to €406 per unit. At a unit cost of €97, RSV prophylaxis 
would be cost saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted RSV prophylaxis is not cost-effective in reducing RSV 
burden of disease in moderately preterm infants, but it can become 
cost-effective if lower priced biosimilar palivizumab or a vaccine would be 
available.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by 
defects in any of the five subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex responsible for 
the respiratory burst in phagocytic leukocytes. Patients with CGD are at 
increased risk of life-threatening infections with catalase-positive bacteria 
and fungi and inflammatory complications such as CGD colitis. The implementation 
of routine antimicrobial prophylaxis and the advent of azole antifungals has 
considerably improved overall survival. Nevertheless, life expectancy remains 
decreased compared to the general population. Inflammatory complications are a 
significant contributor to morbidity in CGD, and they are often refractory to 
standard therapies. At present, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is 
the only curative treatment, and transplantation outcomes have improved over the 
last few decades with overall survival rates now > 90% in children less than 
14 years of age. However, there remains debate as to the optimal conditioning 
regimen, and there is question as to how to manage adolescent and adult 
patients. The current evidence suggests that myeloablative conditioning results 
is more durable myeloid engraftment but with increased toxicity and high rates 
of graft-versus-host disease. In recent years, gene therapy has been proposed as 
an alternative to HCT for patients without an HLA-matched donor. However, 
results to date have not been encouraging. with negligible long-term engraftment 
of gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cells and reports of myelodysplastic 
syndrome due to insertional mutagenesis. Multicenter trials are currently 
underway in the United States and Europe using a SIN-lentiviral vector under the 
control of a myeloid-specific promoter, and, should the trials be successful, 
gene therapy may be a viable option for patients with CGD in the future.

China has the world's largest elderly population, and the oldest-old population, 
with a current disability rate greater than 50%, will triple in the next 35 
years. The field of geriatrics is young, because almost all geriatric 
departments were established after 2000, and so faces many challenges. 
Management of diseases and hospital care is the focus. Senior physicians were 
trained in other subspecialties, such as pulmonary or cardiology, and junior 
physicians entered geriatrics departments as masters or doctorate students after 
medical school. The inadequacy of post-acute and long-term care facilities has 
caused long hospital stays. There are no national systematic geriatric training 
programs, national board examinations, or qualifications in geriatrics. These 
challenges were used as a framework for guiding changes in the Department of 
Geriatrics at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. These changes have 
included international experiences and collaboration for physicians and nurses, 
revision of departmental conferences, and special training for a unique group of 
caregivers called hugong (untrained caregivers hired by families to be at the 
bedside of hospitalized individuals). The most significant yet challenging part 
of the transformation has been to develop and modify Western-based geriatric 
models of care (e.g., Acute Care of the Elderly unit, delirium prevention and 
management models, palliative care). Lastly, the department established Tianxia 
(in the sky) Doctors, an internet-based platform to connect the department's 
interdisciplinary team to other hospitals, nursing institutions, home-based care 
service stations, community health service centers, and pharmacies throughout 
the region.

Newborn genetic screening for spinal muscular atrophy in the UK: The views of 
the general population.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder 
and a leading genetic cause of infant death worldwide. However, there is no 
routine screening program for SMA in the UK. Lack of treatments and the 
inability of screening tests to accurately predict disease severity are among 
the key reasons implementation of screening has faltered in the UK. With the 
recent release of the first therapy for SMA (Nusinersen), calls are being made 
for a reconsideration of this stance; however, very little is known about the 
views of the general public.
METHODS: An online survey was administered to 232 individuals with no prior 
relationship with SMA to assess their attitudes toward a newborn screening 
program for it. Results are compared with previously gathered data on the views 
of SMA-affected families toward screening.
RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of participants were in favor of newborn screening. 
Key reasons for support were a belief that it would lead to better healthcare 
and life expectancy for affected infants and facilitate informed decision-making 
for future pregnancies. Key reasons for nonsupport were a belief in the 
potential for significant negative impact on the family unit in terms of bonding 
and stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Public acceptability is a key component in the evaluation of any 
potential screening program in the UK. This study demonstrates that newborn 
screening for SMA is viewed largely positively by people unfamiliar with the 
condition. The importance of early identification overrode all other social and 
ethical concerns about screening for the majority of participants.

BACKGROUND: Achieving choice is proposed as a quality marker. But little is 
known about what influences preferences especially among older adults. We aimed 
to determine and compare, across three countries, factors associated with 
preferences for place of death and treatment, and actual site of death.
METHODS: We recruited adults aged ≥65-years from hospital-based 
multiprofessional palliative care services in London, Dublin, New York, and 
followed them for >17 months. All services offered consultation on hospital 
wards, support for existing clinical teams, outpatient services and received 
funding from their National Health Service and/or relevant Insurance 
reimbursements. The New York service additionally had 10 inpatient beds. All 
worked with and referred patients to local hospices. Face-to-face interviews 
recorded most and least preferred place of death, treatment goal priorities, 
demographic and clinical information using validated questionnaires. 
Multivariable and multilevel analyses assessed associated factors.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty eight older adults (64 London, 59 Dublin, 15 New 
York) were recruited, 110 died during follow-up. Home was the most preferred 
place of death (77/138, 56%) followed by inpatient palliative care/hospice units 
(22%). Hospital was least preferred (35/138, 25%), followed by nursing home 
(20%) and home (16%); hospice/palliative care unit was rarely least preferred 
(4%). Most respondents prioritised improving quality of life, either alone 
(54%), or equal with life extension (39%); few (3%) chose only life extension. 
There were no significant differences between countries. Main associates with 
home preference were: cancer diagnosis (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.40-9.90) and living 
with someone (OR 2.19, 1.33-3.62). Adults with non-cancer diagnoses were more 
likely to prefer palliative care units (OR 2.39, 1.14-5.03). Conversely, 
functional independence (OR 1.05, 1.04-1.06) and valuing quality of life (OR 
3.11, 2.89-3.36) were associated with dying at home. There was a mismatch 
between preferences and achievements - of 85 people who preferred home or a 
palliative care unit, 19 (25%) achieved their first preference.
CONCLUSION: Although home is the most common first preference, it is polarising 
and for 16% it is the least preferred. Inpatient palliative care unit emerges as 
the second most preferred place, is rarely least preferred, and yet was often 
not achieved for those who wanted to die there. Factors affecting stated 
preferences and met preferences differ. Available services, notably community 
support and palliative care units, require expansion. Contrasting actual place 
of death with capacity for meeting patient and family needs may be a better 
quality indicator than simply 'achieved preferences'.
