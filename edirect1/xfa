Mitral valvotomy is of established value in improving the clinical condition and 
life expectancy of patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. Its value in 
preventing or reducing the incidence of systemic arterial embolism is less 
certain. A comparison of pre- and post-operative embolic incidence can only be 
accepted if it is clear that the method of assessing the pre-operative figure is 
reliable. It is shown that the figure varies according to the length of the 
pre-operative study, and evidence is presented to show a changing incidence with 
increasing length of chronic rheumatic history. By studying patients in whom the 
time of onset of rheumatic heart disease is accurately known, a rising embolic 
incidence with the passage of time is shown. A comparison is made between groups 
of patients who have experienced the same length of chronic rheumatic history 
but who differ in respect of mitral valvotomy. We conclude from our comparison 
that this operation does not diminish the incidence of embolism, though only 
about a quarter of all our patients had atrial appendagectomy at the time of 
valvotomy. A reduction in the incidence of recurrent embolism in a given patient 
after mitral valvotomy is shown but may be more apparent than real. Operative 
embolism, defined here as that occurring either at or within 48 hours of 
operation, has an incidence of 3·8%. The factors related to pre-operative, 
operative, and post-operative embolism are presented.

Immune response with particular reference to the use of multiple antigens.

Wehrle PF.

The increasing demand for preventive child health services and the general 
increase in international travel compel greater attention to the use of multiple 
antigens, both inactivated and live, when administered simultaneously. It 
appears that with the preparations currently licensed, multiple inactivated 
antigens may be given safely and with expectation of optimal effectiveness. dpt 
is a routine combination employed in combination with oral trivalent 
poliovaccine for primary immunization of infants and young children up to and 
including age six. Oral poliovirus vaccine and vaccinia may be administered at 
the time of the recall or booster dose of dpt vaccine during the second year of 
life, commonly at age 15 to 18 months. It is apparent from published data 
accumulated over many years that several antigens may be administered at the 
same time with adequate immunologic response. The minor differences in antibody 
response following simultaneous administration of live viral antigens is of 
unknown clinical importance. The primary reason for hesitancy in advocating 
greater use of multiple agents at this time is the theoretical consideration of 
possible neurotoxicity with those vaccines where the parent agent may have 
definite neurotoxicity. The question of possible additive or other harmful 
effects with measles, poliomyelitis, and rubella and mumps when given 
simultaneously can be answered only by carefully controlled studies involving 
close observation of the recipients with extension of these trials as data 
permit.

Community demand for doctors in the next 10 years.

Last JM.

The demand for doctors has increased despite improved community health, because 
the prevalence of chronic disease has increased, and because affluence, better 
education, and the growth of specialization have all stimulated demand.Most 
authorities have recommended an increase in the supply of doctors to meet the 
increasing demand. Nevertheless, a supply which preserves the present ratio of 
doctors to population might be adequate if medical productivity were raised. 
Moreover, an increase of the supply stimulates further demand; perhaps demand 
would fall if the supply were reduced, and community health might not 
deteriorate as a result of this.Other social institutions besides medicine have 
a claim on the available pool of talent from which doctors are recruited. It is 
possible that medicine already receives its fair share.

Old age income security in Canada.

Willard JW.

The position of older people in modern industrial society is markedly removed 
from the early industrial norm of continued participation in gainful employment 
until the end of life. Acceptance of a retirement age some 13 years before the 
end of average male life expectancy has brought with it serious social problems. 
At the same time, however, an increasingly productive economy has provided both 
the willingness and ability to complement the retirement provisions of 
individual initiative with public programs of old age income maintenance. This 
public support began in Canada with the voluntary approach embodied in the 
government annuities plan. A program of "public assistance" followed. These were 
succeeded, first, by the "universal payment" under the Old Age Security Act and, 
more recently, by the social insurance approach of the Canada Pension Plan. 
Along with improved public support, the role of occupational pension plans and 
of individually initiated retirement provisions continues to be substantial. 
Current interest in, and in some cases legislation on, such problems as vesting 
and solvency are leading to improvements in private pension programs.

The diagnosis of early carcinoma of the prostate.

Connolly JG.

Careful palpation of the gland is a very important examination procedure in the 
detection of early carcinoma in the prostate. The finding of a suspicious area 
requires additional investigation, which must include histological examination 
of tissue from the suspected lesion. Adequate material for histological studies 
can usually be obtained by needle biopsy. The percutaneous perineal approach has 
been found satisfactory for this purpose. In those whose life expectancy is 10 
years or more, prostatic carcinoma in its early stages should be treated by 
radical prostatectomy. For more advanced lesions or for patients whose life 
expectancy is less, hormonal therapy may be used.

Nutrition, onset of disease, and longevity in the rat.

Berg BN, Simms HS.

The effect of food restriction in rats to a level 46% below the intake of those 
fed ad libitum was studied in relation to onset of disease and longevity. 
Dietary restriction at this level kept adult rats in a nutritional state short 
of the development of excess body fat, and had little effect on skeletal growth 
or sexual maturity. Onset of microscopically observed renal, vascular, 
myocardial and skeletal muscle lesions, as well as mammary fibroadenoma in 
females, was delayed and resulted in greater longevity. Life expectancy of male 
rats was increased by 25% and of females by 39%. Time of onset of disease 
appears to be regulated by a common factor which is influenced by dietary 
intake.
