OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy increases, the need to prevent major health 
disorders is clear. Depressive symptoms are common in older adults and are 
associated with cognitive decline and greater risk for transitioning to major 
depression. Oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathophysiology of major 
depression and can be measured in vivo using proton magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy via the neurometabolite glutathione (GSH). Evidence suggests ω-3 
fatty acid (FA) supplementation may prevent depression and directly affect GSH 
concentration. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ω-3 FA 
supplementation on in vivo GSH concentration in older adults at risk for 
depression.
METHODS: Fifty-one older adults at risk for depression were randomized to 
receive either four 1000-mg ω-3 FA supplements daily (containing 
eicosapentaenoic acid 1200 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid 800 mg) or placebo (four 
1000-mg paraffin oil placebo capsules daily) for 12 wk. Participants underwent 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as medical, neuropsychological, and 
self-report assessments at baseline and after 12 wk of supplementation. GSH was 
measured in the thalamus and calculated as a ratio to creatine. Depressive 
symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Compared with the group given the ω-3 FA supplements, the placebo group 
had greater change in the GSH-to-creatine ratio in the thalamus (t = 2.00; P = 
0.049) after the 12 wk intervention. This increase was in turn associated with a 
worsening of depressive symptoms (r = 0.43; P = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptom severity in older adults appears to be 
associated with increased brain levels of GSH, a key marker of oxidative stress. 
Importantly, ω-3 FA supplementation may attenuate oxidative stress mechanisms, 
thereby offering benefits for depression prevention.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a world-wide epidemic. 
This chronic metabolic disease has a major impact on life expectancy and on 
quality of life. The burden of this disease includes a number of co-morbidities. 
However, estimates of prevalence, incidence and associated diseases as well as 
the current temporal development and regional differences are largely missing 
for South Western Germany.
METHODS: Lifetime diagnosis-based prevalence, incidence and presence of 
concomitant co-morbidities were examined between the years 2007 and 2010 in the 
claims data set of all insured persons of the AOK Baden-Wuerttemberg, a large 
statutory health insurance. The analysis was based on the respective WHO-ICD-10 
codes. Data were standardized for age and sex on the residential population of 
about 10 million inhabitants of South Western Germany.
RESULTS: The total study cohort involved approximately 3.5 million persons each 
year. The standardized diagnosis-based prevalence (SDP) of T2DM rose from 6.6%, 
7.4%, 8.0%, up to 8.6% in the years 2007 to 2010. Yearly SDP was between 14.0% 
and 18.9% at an age range of 60 to 64 years and between 26.7% and 31.8% at an 
age of 75 years or older. In the year 2010 the regional distributions of 
standardized diagnosis-based prevalence were between 7.6% and 11.6 %, 
respectively. Incidence rates were 8.3 in 2008, 7.8 in 2009, and 8.7 in 2010 
(all rates per 1000). The excess disease risk (odds ratio) of T2DM was for 
adiposity 2.8 to 3.0, hypertension 2.4 to 3.7, coronary heart disease 1.8 to 
1.9, stroke 1.7 to 1.8, renal insufficiency 2.8 to 3.4, and retinopathy 2.8 to 
2.9 in the years 2007 to 2010. These co-morbidities appeared several years 
earlier compared to the non-diabetic population.
CONCLUSIONS: T2DM is common and increasing in South Western Germany. In 
particular a quarter of the population in higher ages was afflicted by T2DM. 
Interestingly a region-specific pattern was observed as well as an increase in 
numbers during earlier years in life. Our data underline the need for diabetes 
awareness programmes including early diagnosis measures as well as structured 
and timely health surveys for major diseases such as T2DM and its concomitant 
co-morbidities.

Seed germination is a key developmental process that has to be tightly 
controlled to avoid germination under unfavourable conditions. Abscisic acid 
(ABA) is an essential repressor of seed germination. In Arabidopsis, it has been 
shown that the endosperm, a single cell layer surrounding the embryo, 
synthesizes and continuously releases ABA towards the embryo. The mechanism of 
ABA transport from the endosperm to the embryo was hitherto unknown. Here we 
show that four AtABCG transporters act in concert to deliver ABA from the 
endosperm to the embryo: AtABCG25 and AtABCG31 export ABA from the endosperm, 
whereas AtABCG30 and AtABCG40 import ABA into the embryo. Thus, this work 
establishes that radicle extension and subsequent embryonic growth are 
suppressed by the coordinated activity of multiple ABA transporters expressed in 
different tissues.

Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term mortality for subjects with acute head 
trauma.
BACKGROUND: It is not known why long-term mortality after head trauma without 
traumatic brain injury is elevated.
METHODS: All subjects admitted to Oulu University Hospital emergency room in 
1999 with an acute head trauma (n = 737) were followed up until February 2014 
and compared with age and sex-matched general population controls (n = 2196). 
Dates and causes of death were obtained from the official Cause-of-Death 
Statistics. Cox proportional hazard regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves were used to identify predictors for alcohol-related, nonalcohol-related, 
and all-cause death.
RESULTS: Alcohol-related deaths were more frequent among the subjects with head 
trauma (27.8%) than among the population controls (6.9%). Head trauma with or 
without traumatic brain injury (TBI) shortened mean life expectancy by 8.7 years 
and by as much as 13 years if only those without TBI were considered. The risk 
of alcohol-related death was 7-fold (hazard ratio 6.79; 95% confidence interval, 
3.94-11.71) among subjects without TBI as compared with general population. Of 
all future deaths among these cases 17.1% were because of a new trauma, a 
significantly higher frequency (P < 0.005) than that observed in the general 
population (3% of all deaths). Alcohol-related cause of death was significantly 
more common among the subjects who were under the influence of alcohol at the 
time of the index trauma than among the sober subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Head trauma subjects without TBI have an elevated risk of 
alcohol-related death. Alcohol-related traumas are a major cause of death among 
these subjects.

Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.

BACKGROUND: To control an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) among 
men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City, the New York City Department 
of Health and Mental Hygiene recommended vaccination of all HIV-infected MSM and 
at-risk HIV-uninfected MSM in October 2012.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the cost-effectiveness of 
meningococcal vaccination compared with no vaccination. Model inputs, including 
IMD incidence of 20.5 per 100,000 HIV-positive MSM (42% fatal) and 7.6 per 
100,000 HIV-negative MSM (20% fatal), were from Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene reported data and published sources. Outcomes included costs (2012 US 
dollars), IMD cases averted, IMD deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; $/QALY). Scenarios 
with and without herd immunity were considered, and sensitivity analyses were 
performed on key inputs.
RESULTS: Compared with no vaccination, the targeted vaccination campaign averted 
an estimated 2.7 IMD cases, 1.0 IMD deaths, with an ICER of $66,000/QALY when 
herd immunity was assumed. Without herd immunity, vaccination prevented 1.1 IMD 
cases, 0.4 IMD deaths, with an ICER of $177,000/QALY. In one-way sensitivity 
analyses, variables that exerted the greatest influence on results in order of 
effect were the magnitude of herd immunity, IMD case fatality ratio, and IMD 
incidence. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, at a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of $100,000/QALY, vaccination was preferred in 97% of simulations with 
herd immunity and 20% of simulations without herd immunity.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination during an IMD outbreak among MSM with and without HIV 
infection was projected to avert IMD cases and deaths and could be 
cost-effective depending on IMD incidence, case fatality, and herd immunity.

BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphataemia is common and harmful in patients receiving 
dialysis. Treatment options include noncalcium-based phosphate binders such as 
sevelamer carbonate (SC) and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (PA21).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the health economic impact of 
PA21-based strategies compared with SC-based strategies, from the perspective of 
the Scottish National Health Service (NHS).
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on data from a randomised clinical 
trial comparing PA21 and SC. Model input parameters were derived from published 
literature, national statistics and unpublished sources. Costs (price year 2012) 
and effects were discounted at 3.5 %. Analysis with a lifelong time horizon 
yielded the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost or 
savings per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or forgone. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to explore uncertainties 
around assumptions and model input parameters.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, phosphorus reductions for PA21 and SC were 
1.93 and 1.95 mg/dL. Average undiscounted survival was estimated to be 7.61 
years per patient in both strategies. PA21 patients accrued less QALYs (2.826) 
than SC patients (2.835), partially due to differential occurrence of side 
effects. Total costs were ₤ 13,119 and ₤ 14,728 for PA21 and SC, respectively 
(difference per patient of ₤ 1609). By using PA21 versus SC, one would save ₤ 
174,999 (or ₤ 123,463 when including dialysis and transplantation costs) for one 
QALY forgone. A scenario modelling the nonsignificant reduction in mortality 
(relative risk 0.714) observed in the trial yielded an ICER for PA21 of ₤ 22,621 
per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the base-case, PA21 
was dominant in 11 %, and at least cost-effective in 53 %, of iterations, using 
a threshold of ₤ 20,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of PA21 versus SC in hyperphosphataemic patients being 
intolerant of calcium-based phosphate binders may be cost saving and yields only 
very limited disadvantages in terms of quality-adjusted survival. PA21 appears 
to be cost-effective from the perspective of the Scottish NHS.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Factors including rate of disease progression, different 
aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment, and use of community-based 
services might affect the longitudinal outcome of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Whether these factors alter life expectancy in AD is unclear. We therefore 
examined the association between long-term ChEI therapy and survival.
METHODS: The present study included 1,021 patients with a clinical diagnosis of 
AD and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 10-26 at baseline from a 3-year, 
prospective, multicenter study of ChEI therapy in clinical practice. The 
relationship of potential predictors with mortality was analyzed using Cox 
regression models.
RESULTS: After up to 16 years of follow-up, 841 (82%) of the participants had 
died. In the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, a mean 
decline of ≥ 4 points/year or ≥ 2 points/year on the Physical Self-Maintenance 
Scale was a risk factor for an earlier death. In the multivariate models, longer 
survival was associated with higher ChEI dose and longer duration of treatment. 
Users of community-based services at baseline exhibited a 1-year shorter mean 
life expectancy than nonusers.
CONCLUSION: A longer survival time can be anticipated for AD patients with 
slower deterioration who receive and tolerate higher ChEI doses and a longer 
duration of treatment.

Associations between STR autosomal markers and longevity.

Country UPV/EHU, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.

Life span is a complex and multifactorial trait, which is shaped by genetic, 
epigenetic, environmental, and stochastic factors. The possibility that highly 
hypervariable short tandem repeats (STRs) associated with longevity has been 
largely explored by comparing the genotypic pools of long lived and younger 
individuals, but results so far have been contradictory. In view of these 
contradictory findings, the present study aims to investigate whether HUMTHO1 
and HUMCSF1PO STRs, previously associated with longevity, exert a role as a 
modulator of life expectancy, as well as to assess the extent to which other 
autosomal STR markers are associated with human longevity in population from 
northern Spain. To that end, 21 autosomal microsatellite markers have been 
studied in 304 nonagenarian individuals (more than 90 years old) and 516 younger 
controls of European descent. Our results do not confirm the association found 
in previous studies between longevity and THO1 and CSF1PO loci. However, 
significant association between longevity and autosomal STR markers D12S391, 
D22S1045, and DS441 was observed. Even more, when we compared allelic frequency 
distribution of the 21 STR markers between cases and controls, we found that 6 
out of the 21 STRs studied showed different allelic frequencies, thus suggesting 
that the genomic portrait of the human longevity is far complex and probably 
shaped by a high number of genomic loci.

BACKGROUND: The need for ways to minimize the number of implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks is increasing owing to the risk of its 
adverse effects on life expectancy. Studies have shown that a longer detection 
time for ventricular tachyarrhythmia reduces the safety of therapies, in terms 
of syncope and mortality, but not substantially in terms of the success rate. We 
aimed to evaluate the effects of increased number of intervals to detect (NID) 
VF on the safety of ICD shock therapy and on the reduction of inappropriate 
shocks.
METHODS: The present study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover 
study. Randomized VF induction testing with NID 18/24 or 30/40 was performed to 
compare the success rate of defibrillation with a 25-J shock and the time to 
detection. Inappropriate shock episodes were simulated retrospectively to 
evaluate a possibility of episodes avoidable at NID 24/32 and 30/40.
RESULTS: Thirty-one consecutive patients implanted with an ICD or cardiac 
resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) were enrolled in this study. The 
success rate of defibrillation was 100% in both NID groups at the first shock. 
The time from VF induction to detection showed a significant increase in the NID 
30/40 group (6.16±1.29 s vs. 9.00±1.31 s, p<0.001). Among the 120 patients 
implanted with an ICD or CRT-D, 10 experienced 32 inappropriate shock episodes. 
The inappropriate shock reduction rate was 53.1% and 62.5% with NID 24/32 and 
30/40, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this SANKS study suggest that VF NID 30/40 does not 
compromise the safety of ICD shock therapy, while decreasing the number of 
inappropriate shocks.

OBJECTIVE: The burden of notifiable diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander Victorians cannot be accurately estimated due to under-reporting of 
Indigenous status. We used data linkage to improve completeness of Indigenous 
status in people notified with viral hepatitis and gonococcal infection.
METHODS: Notifications made between 2009 and 2010 were linked with Victorian 
hospitalisation data (1997-2011). Notification rates by Indigenous status and 
rate ratios were calculated before and after linkage.
RESULTS: There were 12,448 cases of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and gonococcal 
infection notified in Victoria in 2009-2010, with Indigenous status missing in 
61.6%, 67.8%, 33.1% of these conditions, respectively. Of the total notified 
cases, 82% were able to be linked. Following linkage, the proportion of 
notifications with missing Indigenous status decreased to less than 0.2% for all 
conditions. Age-standardised notification rates among both Aboriginal people and 
non-Aboriginal people increased for all conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Data linkage improved completeness of Indigenous status in 
notifications for viral hepatitis and gonococcal infection in Victoria. 
Completeness of these data is integral to monitoring progress in closing the 
Indigenous life expectancy gap.
IMPLICATIONS: Greater emphasis is needed on addressing prevention, treatment and 
care for viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections for Indigenous 
Victorians.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a rapidly growing global health problem within 
the past decades due to increased life expectancy, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, and vascular diseases. Since ESRD is not curable definitively, 
patients suffering from ESRD have a very low quality of life; therefore, 
symptomatic management is the cornerstone of medical treatment. Uremia affects 
almost all body organs, such as skin, through different mechanisms including 
biochemical, vascular, neurologic, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine, and 
electrolyte and volume balance disturbances. Some of these conditions are 
associated with significant morbidity, and patients with ESRD commonly present 
with a spectrum of dermatologic disorders. Each one has its own unique 
presentation and treatment approaches. In this review article, we discuss the 
clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of the most common skin 
disorders associated with ESRD.

The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) recognizes the mRNA cap structure 
and, together with eIF4G and eIF4A, form the eIF4F complex that regulates 
translation initiation in eukaryotes. In trypanosomatids, 2 eIF4E homologues 
(EIF4E3 and EIF4E4) have been shown to be part of eIF4F-like complexes with 
presumed roles in translation initiation. Both proteins possess unique 
N-terminal extensions, which can be targeted for phosphorylation. Here, we 
provide novel insights on the Leishmania infantum EIF4E4 function and 
regulation. We show that EIF4E4 is constitutively expressed throughout the 
parasite development but is preferentially phosphorylated in exponentially grown 
promastigote and amastigote life stages, hence correlating with high levels of 
translation. Phosphorylation targets multiple serine-proline or 
threonine-proline residues within the N-terminal extension of EIF4E4 but does 
not require binding to the EIF4E4's partner, EIF4G3, or to the cap structure. We 
also report that EIF4E4 interacts with PABP1 through 3 conserved boxes at the 
EIF4E4 N-terminus and that this interaction is a prerequisite for efficient 
EIF4E4 phosphorylation. EIF4E4 is essential for Leishmania growth and an EIF4E4 
null mutant was only obtained in the presence of an ectopically provided wild 
type gene. Complementation for the loss of EIF4E4 with several EIF4E4 mutant 
proteins affecting either phosphorylation or binding to mRNA or to EIF4E4 
protein partners revealed that, in contrast to other eukaryotes, only the 
EIF4E4-PABP1 interaction but neither the binding to EIF4G3 nor phosphorylation 
is essential for translation. These studies also demonstrated that the lack of 
both EIF4E4 phosphorylation and EIF4G3 binding leads to a non-functional 
protein. Altogether, these findings further highlight the unique features of the 
translation initiation process in trypanosomatid protozoa.

OBJECTIVE: Assess the cost-effectiveness of an EGFR-mutation testing strategy 
for advanced NSCLC in first-line therapy with either gefitinib or 
carboplatin-paclitaxel in Mexican institutions.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a discrete event simulation (DES) 
model to simulate two therapeutic strategies in patients with advanced NSCLC. 
Strategy one included patients tested for EGFR-mutation and therapy given 
accordingly. Strategy two included chemotherapy for all patients without 
testing. All results are presented in 2014 US dollars. The analysis was made 
with data from the Mexican frequency of EGFR-mutation. A univariate sensitivity 
analysis was conducted on EGFR prevalence. Progression-free survival (PFS) 
transition probabilities were estimated on data from the IPASS and simulated 
with a Weibull distribution, run with parallel trials to calculate a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: PFS of patients in the testing strategy was 6.76 months (95 % CI 
6.10-7.44) vs 5.85 months (95 % CI 5.43-6.29) in the non-testing group. The 
one-way sensitivity analysis showed that PFS has a direct relationship with 
EGFR-mutation prevalence, while the ICER and testing cost have an inverse 
relationship with EGFR-mutation prevalence. The probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed that all iterations had incremental costs and incremental PFS 
for strategy 1 in comparison with strategy 2.
CONCLUSION: There is a direct relationship between the ICER and the cost of EGFR 
testing, with an inverse relationship with the prevalence of EGFR-mutation. When 
prevalence is >10 % ICER remains constant. This study could impact Mexican and 
Latin American health policies regarding mutation detection testing and 
treatment for advanced NSCLC.

The POpulation HEalth Model (POHEM) is a health microsimulation model that was 
developed at Statistics Canada in the early 1990s. POHEM draws together rich 
multivariate data from a wide range of sources to simulate the lifecycle of the 
Canadian population, specifically focusing on aspects of health. The model 
dynamically simulates individuals' disease states, risk factors, and health 
determinants, in order to describe and project health outcomes, including 
disease incidence, prevalence, life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy, 
quality of life, and healthcare costs. Additionally, POHEM was conceptualized 
and built with the ability to assess the impact of policy and program 
interventions, not limited to those taking place in the healthcare system, on 
the health status of Canadians. Internationally, POHEM and other microsimulation 
models have been used to inform clinical guidelines and health policies in 
relation to complex health and health system problems. This paper provides a 
high-level overview of the rationale, methodology, and applications of POHEM. 
Applications of POHEM to cardiovascular disease, physical activity, cancer, 
osteoarthritis, and neurological diseases are highlighted.

Thanks to increasingly effective treatment, breast cancer mortality rates have 
significantly declined over the past few decades. Following the increase in life 
expectancy of women diagnosed with breast cancer, it has been recognized that 
these women are at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease due in part to 
the cardiotoxic side effects of treatment. This paper reviews evidence for the 
role of exercise in prevention of cardiovascular toxicity associated with 
chemotherapy used in breast cancer, and in modifying cardiovascular risk factors 
in breast cancer survivors. There is growing evidence indicating that the 
primary mechanism for this protective effect appears to be improved antioxidant 
capacity in the heart and vasculature and subsequent reduction of 
treatment-related oxidative stress in these structures. Further clinical 
research is needed to determine whether exercise is a feasible and effective 
nonpharmacological treatment to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 
breast cancer survivors, to identify the cancer therapies for which it is 
effective, and to determine the optimal exercise dose. Safe and noninvasive 
measures that are sensitive to changes in cardiovascular function are required 
to answer these questions in patient populations. Cardiac strain, endothelial 
function, and cardiac biomarkers are suggested outcome measures for clinical 
research in this field.

Parameter estimates from commonly used multivariable parametric survival 
regression models do not directly quantify differences in years of life 
expectancy. Gaussian linear regression models give results in terms of absolute 
mean differences, but are not appropriate in modeling life expectancy, because 
in many situations time to death has a negative skewed distribution. A 
regression approach using a skew-normal distribution would be an alternative to 
parametric survival models in the modeling of life expectancy, because parameter 
estimates can be interpreted in terms of survival time differences while 
allowing for skewness of the distribution. In this paper we show how to use the 
skew-normal regression so that censored and left-truncated observations are 
accounted for. With this we model differences in life expectancy using data from 
the Swiss National Cohort Study and from official life expectancy estimates and 
compare the results with those derived from commonly used survival regression 
models. We conclude that a censored skew-normal survival regression approach for 
left-truncated observations can be used to model differences in life expectancy 
across covariates of interest.

BACKGROUND: The COUGAR-02 trial recently showed survival and quality-of-life 
benefits of docetaxel and active symptom control (DXL + ASC) over active symptom 
control (ASC) alone in patients with refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.
AIM: The aim of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation conforming to 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal 
guidance to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DXL + ASC versus ASC from the 
perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS).
METHODS: Cost-utility analyses were conducted using trial data. Utility values 
were captured using the EQ-5D completed by patients at 3- and 6-weekly 
intervals, while resource use was captured using nurse-completed report forms 
and patient reports. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated and the main outcome was cost per incremental quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted to capture sampling 
uncertainty and to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The 
analysis horizon was the trial period (median follow-up 12 months) and no 
modelling or discounting of future costs and benefits was conducted.
RESULTS: Average costs were £9352 and £6218 for DXL + ASC and ASC, respectively, 
and average QALYs were 0.302 and 0.186, respectively. This yielded an ICER of 
£27,180 for DXL + ASC. DXL + ASC had a 24 % chance of being cost effective at a 
£20,000 QALY threshold (lambda) and a mean net monetary benefit of -£821; this 
rose to 59 % and £332 when the threshold was raised to £30,000. If NICE 
end-of-life criteria are applied, the probability of cost effectiveness 
increases to 90 % (at lambda = £50,000). Results were robust to sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: DXL + ASC is likely to be cost effective if an end-of-life premium 
is applied. Further research should determine the impact of different utility 
measurement strategies and different chemotherapy delivery modes on estimates of 
cost effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the remaining life expectancy with and without 
polypharmacy for Swedish women and men aged 65 years and older.
DESIGN: Age-specific prevalence of polypharmacy from the nationwide Swedish 
Prescribed Drug Register (SPDR) combined with life tables from Statistics Sweden 
was used to calculate the survival function and remaining life expectancy with 
and without polypharmacy according to the Sullivan method.
SETTING: Nationwide register-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,347,564 individuals aged 65 years and older who had 
been prescribed and dispensed a drug from July 1 to September 30, 2008.
MEASUREMENTS: Polypharmacy was defined as the concurrent use of 5 or more drugs.
RESULTS: At age 65 years, approximately 8 years of the 20 remaining years of 
life (41%) can be expected to be lived with polypharmacy. More than half of the 
remaining life expectancy will be spent with polypharmacy after the age of 75 
years. Women had a longer life expectancy, but also lived more years with 
polypharmacy than men.
DISCUSSION: Older women and men spend a considerable proportion of their lives 
with polypharmacy.
CONCLUSION: Given the negative health outcomes associated with polypharmacy, 
efforts should be made to reduce the number of years older adults spend with 
polypharmacy to minimize the risk of unwanted consequences.

BACKGROUND: The Draf III (modified endoscopic Lothrop) procedure has been 
proposed to extend the endonasal transethmoidal, transfovea ethmoidalis, and 
transcribriform approach through the back wall of the frontal sinus. The 
exposure is time-consuming and increases the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak, 
and the indications for use are not well described. There are few data 
quantifying the advantage it conveys over the approach without the Draf III 
procedure.
METHODS: An endoscopic, endonasal transfovea, transcribriform approach was 
performed in 5 fresh, injected cadaveric heads. Anatomic boundaries and 
measurements of the exposure were compared before and after addition of a Draf 
III procedure. Computed tomography scans were performed before and after 
dissection, and additional radiographic measurements were made to quantify the 
additional exposure provided by the Draf III procedure. Also, 2 clinical cases 
are presented in which a Draf III procedure was used.
RESULTS: The mean anterior to posterior boundary from the frontal sinus to the 
planum sphenoidale before the Draf III procedure was 3.0 cm and after the Draf 
III procedure was 3.8 cm with an average change of 0.8 cm. After the Draf III 
procedure, the mean anterior to posterior boundary from the posterior wall of 
frontal sinus to the planum sphenoidale increased from 3.0 cm to 4.3 cm. There 
was an average increase of 1.3 cm with an average increased area of view of 1.79 
cm(2).
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the increased field of view provided by the 
Draf III procedure during anterior skull base dissection. Recommendations for 
preoperative examination of radiographic evidence are provided to help identify 
which individuals would benefit from the additional exposure.

Sickle cell disease causes acute and chronic illness, and median life expectancy 
is reduced by at least 30 years in all countries, with greater reductions in 
low-income countries. There is a wide spectrum of severity, with some patients 
having no symptoms and others suffering frequent, life-changing complications. 
Much of this variability is unexplained, despite increasingly sophisticated 
genetic studies. Environmental factors, including climate, air quality, 
socio-economics, exercise and infection, are likely to be important, as 
demonstrated by the stark differences in outcomes between patients in Africa and 
USA/Europe. The effects of weather vary with geography, although most studies 
show that exposure to cold or wind increases hospital attendance with acute 
pain. Most of the different air pollutants are closely intercorrelated, and 
increasing overall levels seem to correlate with increased hospital attendance, 
although higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide may offer some 
benefit for patients with sickle cell disease. Exercise causes some adverse 
physiological changes, although this may be off-set by improvements in 
cardiovascular health. Most sickle cell disease patients live in low-income 
countries and socioeconomic factors are undoubtedly important, but little 
studied beyond documenting that sickle cell disease is associated with decreases 
in some measures of social status. Infections cause many of the differences in 
outcomes seen across the world, but again these effects are relatively poorly 
understood. All the above factors are likely to account for much of the 
pathology and variability of sickle cell disease, and large prospective studies 
are needed to understand these effects better.

OBJECTIVE: To assess national trends in the usage of local ablative therapy for 
small renal masses (SRMs) in a cohort of young patients. Ablation of SRMs has 
been shown to offer cancer control with limited follow-up. Although ablation is 
considered effective for patients with limited life expectancy, its use among
