OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of home telemonitoring (HTM) and 
nurse telephone support (NTS) compared with usual care (UC) in the management of 
patients with chronic heart failure, from a third-party payer's perspective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with a 20-year time horizon to analyze the 
cost effectiveness using the original study (Trans-European Network-Home-Care 
Management System) and various data sources. A probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess the decision uncertainty in our model.
RESULTS: In the original scenario (which concerned the cost inputs at the time 
of the original study), HTM and NTS interventions yielded a difference in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained compared with UC: 2.93 and 3.07, 
respectively, versus 1.91. An incremental net monetary benefit analysis showed 
€7,697 and €13,589 in HTM and NTS versus UC at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of €20,000, and €69,100 and €83,100 at a WTP threshold of €80,000, 
respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were €12,479 for HTM 
versus UC and €8,270 for NTS versus UC. The current scenario (including 
telenurse cost inputs in NTS) yielded results that were slightly different from 
those for the original scenario, when comparing all New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) classes of severity. NTS dominated HTM, compared with UC, in all NYHA 
classes except NYHA IV.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study demonstrated that HTM and NTS are viable 
solutions to support patients with chronic heart failure. NTS is cost-effective 
in comparison with UC at a WTP of €9000/QALY or higher. Like NTS, HTM improves 
the survival of patients in all NYHA classes and is cost-effective in comparison 
with UC at a WTP of €14,000/QALY or higher.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of two planning strategies 
of the second-generation direct-acting antiviral interferon-free regimens for 
the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.
METHODS: A lifetime multicohort model comprised 8125 real-life patients enrolled 
in the PITER (Italian platform for the study of viral hepatitis) registry, 
implemented by the ISS (Istituto Superiore di Sanità). Two treatment planning 
strategies were compared: 1) policy 1-treat all patients regardless of the stage 
of fibrosis (F0-F4) with second-generation direct-acting antivirals and 2) 
policy 2-treat patients at F3/F4 stage and those who are prioritized by the 
scientific guidelines first, and the remaining patients when they reach the F3 
stage. Clinical outcomes and costs were evaluated by using a lifetime horizon 
Markov model and adopting the third-party payer perspective. Health outcomes 
were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A sensitivity 
analysis was run to explore first- and second-order uncertainty and 
heterogeneity. An expected value of perfect information analysis was also 
conducted.
RESULTS: Policy 1 exhibits an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
€8,775/QALY gained and remains less than €30,000/QALY in 94% of realizations 
produced by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Such a proportion increases to 97% when 
adopting a threshold of €40,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Moving from the urgency criterion to evidence-based escalating 
strategies when prioritizing the access to new anti-hepatitis C virus treatments 
is a good investment in health, whose affordability should be explored through 
context-specific budget impact analyses.

With increasing life expectancy and growth of the elderly US population, it 
becomes paramount that breast cancer research focuses more on the prevention, 
screening, and treatment of these patients. Age is no longer a cutoff for 
managing breast cancer in the elderly. Studies have shown the current 
undertreatment of cancer undermines survival, but the tide is turning to provide 
evidence-based medicine for the elderly. More often, clinicians and surgeons 
look not only at tumor-specific characteristics of breast cancer but also the 
functionality, tolerance, comorbidities, and life expectancy of patients to 
determine the best treatment.

Radiation Therapy Availability in Africa and Latin America: Two Models of Low 
and Middle Income Countries.

Access to radiation facilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is far 
from optimal. Latin America and Africa represent 55% of LMIC, and radiation 
therapy facilities are available in only 70% and 46% of the countries, 
respectively. Only 3 countries in both regions meet the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's recommendation of 250,000 population per megavoltage machine 
(MVM). In Africa, the mean population served by 1 MVM is 3.56 million, compared 
with 0.65 million in Latin America. The distribution of radiation facilities in 
both regions varies according to income group. In Latin America, 
lower-middle-income countries have a distribution of 1.64 million inhabitants 
per MVM, as opposed to 0.64 and 0.49 million inhabitants per MVM in 
upper-middle- and high-income countries, respectively. In Africa, a distribution 
of 39.8, 2.47, and 0.8 million people per MVM is present in low-, lower-middle-, 
and upper-middle-income countries, respectively. Significant correlations were 
clearly demonstrated between population per MVM and gross domestic product (GDP) 
per capita (r = -0.3, P = .014), percentage of current health expenditure from 
GDP (r = -0.4, P = .014), life expectancy (r = -0.5, P = .0007), and cancer 
mortality incidence ratio (r = 0.4, P = .003). Stepwise multivariate regression 
showed that life expectancy was the only statistically significant factor 
(P = .001). These findings may indicate the detrimental impact of low radiation 
therapy coverage on life expectancy and cancer mortality incidence ratio in 
LMIC. It is noteworthy that in Latin America, a significant negative correlation 
was noted between population per MVM and GDP per capita (r = -0.6, P = .0004), 
as opposed to Africa (r = -0.4, P = .075). This indicates that African countries 
face challenges other than income level in addressing radiation therapy needs. 
More international efforts are urgently required to address the crisis of unmet 
radiation therapy needs in LMIC.

CONTEXT: Organ transplantation requires immunosuppression, which was regarded as 
a risk factor for tumor induction and tumor progression in all types of 
malignancy. Until recently, any form of active neoplasia was, therefore, 
regarded as contraindicative to organ transplantation. However, there is growing 
evidence that the increased tumor risk by immunosuppression is restricted to 
particular subgroups of malignancy, whereas others such as prostate cancer (PCa) 
are not negatively influenced.
OBJECTIVE: To compare life expectancy (LE) under various low-risk situations of 
PCa (untreated low-risk primary tumor, slowly progressing asymptomatic 
biochemical recurrence after curative treatment) with LE under renal replacement 
therapy. To discuss the question whether or not low-risk untreated or incurable 
situations of PCa must be regarded contraindicative to kidney transplantation 
(KT) or to transplantation of other organs.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed 
to identify original and review articles regarding PCa risk after KT as well as 
the natural history of untreated and treated situations of PCa. Articles 
published between 1991 and 2018 were reviewed and selected with the consensus of 
all the authors.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: No evidence could be found that KT and immunosuppression are 
associated with an increased PCa-related risk, neither in incidence nor in 
aggressiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for and treatment of PCa in applicants for KT or in 
patients after KT should be performed in an individualized manner on the basis 
of lifetime risk calculations. In particular, untreated or incurable low-risk 
manifestations (presumed LE >10 yr) of PCa cannot be regarded as strictly 
contraindicative against KT.
PATIENT SUMMARY: For prostate cancer, even when left untreated, a number of 
low-risk situations can be defined which are associated with a life expectancy 
(LE) of 15 yr and more. The LE of elderly patients suffering from end-stage 
renal failure often does not significantly exceed 15 yr even after kidney 
transplantation (KT). When remaining on dialysis, however, their further LE is 
significantly reduced and often far below 15 yr. To the best of the presently 
available knowledge, KT does not worsen or accelerate the course of untreated 
low-risk prostate cancer. Even in the presence of untreated low-risk prostate 
cancer, patients with end-stage renal failure must, therefore, be expected to 
significantly benefit from KT.

INTRODUCTION: Among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcohol 
synergistically increases the risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and 
death. Randomized controlled trials of integrated models of HCV-alcohol 
treatment have been recommended but only performed in patients with severe 
alcohol use disorders.
OBJECTIVES: This pragmatic randomized controlled trial seeks to compare clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated alcohol treatment compared to 
enhanced treatment as usual (TAU) on alcohol consumption and economic outcomes 
among patients ever infected with HCV.
METHODS: Patients recruited from three liver centers who had current or prior 
chronic HCV and qualifying alcohol screener scores were randomly assigned to 
enhanced TAU or the Hepatitis C-Alcohol Reduction Treatment (Hep ART) 
intervention. All patients received enhanced TAU, consisting of a 
patient-administered alcohol screener and care from medical providers who were 
trained in Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), 
including brief motivational interviewing counseling. The Hep ART intervention 
combined enhanced TAU with up to six months of integrated co-located individual 
and/or group therapy that provided motivational, cognitive, and behavioral 
strategies to reduce alcohol consumption. The Timeline Followback (TLFB) Method 
was used to evaluate alcohol use at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary 
outcomes are alcohol abstinence and fewer heavy drinking days, and for the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, measures included grams of alcohol consumed.
DISCUSSION: This study will determine whether Hep ART, a six-month integrated 
alcohol treatment, compared to enhanced TAU, is both clinically effective and 
cost-effective in patients with a history of comorbid HCV and alcohol use.

PURPOSE: The prominent efficacy of the addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone (DRd) or the addition to bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd) 
was proven previously for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
(RRMM). However, the cost-effectiveness of adding daratumumab to traditional 
doublet regimens versus doublet regimens alone (DRd vs Rd; DVd vs Vd) was 
unknown.
METHODS: We developed a semi-Markov model by using a US payer perspective and 
10-year time horizon to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for treatments. Clinical data were obtained from the POLLUX (Phase 3 
Study Comparing DRd Versus Rd in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple 
Myeloma [RRMM]) and CASTOR (Phase 3 Study Comparing DVd Versus Vd in Subjects 
with RRMM) trials. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to evaluate model uncertainty.
FINDINGS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DVd compared with 
Vd was $284,180 per QALY; the ICER for DRd compared with Rd was $1,369,062 per 
QALY. Only when the price of daratumumab was reduced to 37% (US $702/vial) of 
the current price could the addition of daratumumab to Vd be cost-effective 
under the US willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000/QALY. However, under no 
discount level of the daratumumab price is the addition of daratumumab to Rd 
acceptable. When the WTP increased to $300,000/QALY, the addition of DVd had a 
56.7% probability of being cost-effective compared with the Vd regimen.
IMPLICATIONS: Due to the high price of daratumumab, neither the addition of 
daratumumab to Rd nor Vd proved to be cost-effective under US WTP. However, if 
the daratumumab price fell to a certain discount level, the DVd regimen might be 
cost-effective.

INTRODUCTION: Advances in medicine have contributed to a higher average life 
expectancy, as well as an increasing number of chronic diseases patients. This 
longevity means that the assessment of the quality of life, particularly that 
related to vision, has become very relevant.
OBJECTIVE: The validation of the translation and cross-cultural adaptation into 
Spanish of one of the most widely used vision-related quality of life 
questionnaires. It has sought to ensure that the Spanish version of the 
questionnaire was equivalent in semantic, conceptual, and technical content and 
criteria level, compared to its already validated English version.
METHOD: An analytical observational study was conducted using a cohort of 
patients, in whom their quality of life related to vision was analysed. The 
study was developed in two steps; the first was the translation and 
cross-cultural adaptation to Spanish of the NEI VFQ-25 questionnaire. The second 
one was the psychometric study of the reliability and validity of the scale of 
the Spanish version.
RESULTS: The analysis of the terms of reliability and validity showed that the 
translation and cross-cultural adaptation met the expected requirements and was 
well accepted by users.
CONCLUSION: There is now a possibility of having a Spanish validated 
questionnaire available to assess the quality of life related to vision in 
patients with chronic diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration.

CORL proteins (known as SKOR in mice, Fussel in humans and fussel in Flybase) 
are a family of CNS specific proteins related to Sno/Ski oncogenes. Their 
developmental and adult roles are largely unknown. A Drosophila CORL (dCORL) 
reporter gene is expressed in all Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (dILP2) 
neurons of the pars intercerebralis (PI) of the larval and adult brain. The 
transcription factor Drifter is also expressed in the PI in a subset of dCORL 
and dILP2 expressing neurons and in several non-dILP2 neurons. dCORL mutant 
virgin adult brains are missing all dILP2 neurons that do not also express 
Drifter. This phenotype is also seen when expressing dCORL-RNAi in 
neurosecretory cells of the PI. dCORL mutant virgin adults of both sexes have a 
significantly shorter lifespan than their parental strain. This longevity defect 
is completely reversed by mating (lifespan increases over 50% for males and 
females). Analyses of dCORL mutant mated adult brains revealed a complete rescue 
of dILP2 neurons without Drifter. Taken together, the data suggest that dCORL 
participates in a neural network connecting the insulin signaling pathway, 
longevity and mating. The conserved sequence and CNS specificity of all CORL 
proteins imply that this network may be operating in mammals.

PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that 
is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function variant in the tumor suppressor 
gene NF1; it affects ~1/1,900-1/3,500 people worldwide. The disorder is 
associated with an 8-15-year reduction in average life expectancy in both men 
and women, primarily due to malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular causes.
METHODS: A work group of experts sought to determine the prevalence, morbidity 
and mortality, and available treatments of common and emerging NF1-related 
clinical problems in adults. Work-group members identified peer-reviewed 
publications from PubMed. Publications derived from populations and 
multi-institution cohorts were prioritized. Recommendations for management arose 
by consensus from this literature and the collective expertise of the authors.
RESULTS: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), breast cancer, 
cutaneous neurofibromas, and significant psychiatric and neurologic diagnoses 
are common problems in patients with NF1.
CONCLUSION: Patient education and sensitization to worrisome signs and symptoms 
such as progressive severe pain (MPNST), changes in tumor volume (MPNST), new, 
unexplained neurologic symptoms (MPNST, brain tumors), and 
diaphoresis/palpitations (pheochromocytoma) are important. Although many issues 
in adults with NF1 can be managed by an internist or family physician, we 
strongly encourage evaluation by, and care coordination with, a specialized NF1 
clinic.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. 
Recurrence rates in breast cancer are considered to be dependent on the serum 
concentration of endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen. The goal of this 
study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of periodically monitoring serum 
concentrations of endoxifen in adjuvant estrogen receptor alfa (ERα) positive 
breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A Markov model with disease-free survival (DFS), recurrent disease 
(RD), and death states was constructed. The benefit of drug monitoring was 
modeled via a difference in the fraction of patients achieving adequate serum 
concentrations. Robustness of results to changes in model assumptions were 
tested through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Monitoring of endoxifen added 0.0115 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and saved € 1564 per patient in the base case scenario. Deterministic 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated a large effect on the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the differences in costs and utilities 
between the DFS and RD states. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 
the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of € 0 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 89.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, monitoring of endoxifen in adjuvant 
ERα + breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen is likely to add QALYs and 
save costs from a healthcare payer perspective. We advise clinicians to consider 
integrating serum endoxifen concentration monitoring into standard adjuvant 
tamoxifen treatment of ERα + breast cancer patients.

Globally, the number of drug prescriptions is increasing causing more adverse 
drug events, which is now a significant cause of mortality, morbidity, and 
disability that has reached epidemic proportions. The risk of adverse drug 
events is correlated to very old age, multiple co-morbidities, dementia, 
frailty, and limited life expectancy, with the major contributor being 
polypharmacy. Each characteristic alters the risk-benefit balance of 
medications, typically reducing anticipated benefits and amplifying risk. 
Current clinical guidelines are based on evidence proven in younger/healthier 
adult populations using a single disease model and their application to older 
adults with multimorbidity, in whom testing has not been conducted, yields a 
different risk-benefit prospect and makes inappropriate medication use and 
polypharmacy inevitable. Applying inappropriate clinical practice guidelines to 
older adults is antithetical to good healthcare, is likely to increase health 
inequity, and is associated with substantial negative clinical, economic, and 
social implications for health systems. The casualties are on the scale of a war 
or epidemic, yet are usually invisible in measures of healthcare quality and 
formal recommendations. Radical and rapid action is required to achieve a better 
quality of life for older populations and to remain true to the principles of 
medical professionalism and evidence-based medicine that place patients' 
interests and autonomy at the fore. This first International Group for Reducing 
Inappropriate Medication Use & Polypharmacy position statement briefly details 
the causes, consequences, and extent of inappropriate medication use and 
polypharmacy. This article outlines current strategies to reduce inappropriate 
medication use, provides evidence for their effect, and then proposes 
recommendations for moving forward with 10 recommendations for action and 12 
recommendations for research. We conclude that an urgent integrated effort to 
reduce inappropriate medication use and polypharmacy should be a leading global 
target of the highest priority. The cornerstone of this position statement from 
the International Group for Reducing Inappropriate Medication Use & Polypharmacy 
is the understanding that without evidence of definite relevant benefit, when it 
comes to prescribing, for many older patients 'less is more'. This approach 
differs from most other current recommendations and guidance in medical care, as 
the focus is on what, when, and how to stop, rather than on when to start 
medications/interventions. Disrupting the framework that indiscriminately 
applies standard guidelines to older adults requires a new approach that better 
serves patients with multimorbidity. This transition requires a shift in medical 
education, research, and diagnostic frameworks, and re-examination of the 
measures used as quality indicators. In achieving this objective, we promote a 
return to some of the original concepts of evidence-based medicine: which 
considers scientific data (where it exists), clinical judgment, patient/family 
preference, and context. A shift is needed: from the current model that focuses 
on single conditions to one that simultaneously considers multiple conditions 
and patient priorities. This approach reframes the clinician's role as a 
professional providing care, rather than a disease technician.

Rotavirus enteritis is responsible for nearly 200,000 child deaths worldwide in 
2015. Globally, many low- and middle-income countries have introduced rotavirus 
vaccine, resulting in documented reductions in hospitalizations and child 
mortality. We examined the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of 
introducing rotavirus vaccination in Lao People's Democratic Republic using an 
Excel-based spreadsheet model. We estimated mortality risk factors, patterns of 
care seeking, and vaccination access to predict outcomes for regional, 
provincial, and socioeconomic subpopulations for one birth cohort through their 
first five years of life and life course in Disability-Adjusted Life Years 
estimates. Socioeconomic status was defined by categorizing households into 
regional wealth quintiles based on a national asset index. We modeled a two-dose 
ROTARIX vaccine under current Gavi pricing and efficacy estimates from 
Bangladesh and Vietnam. DPT1 and DPT2 coverages were used to estimate rotavirus 
vaccination coverage. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the 
impact of uncertainty on model parameters on predicted incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), including scenarios of increases in 
vaccination coverage. Rotavirus vaccination would prevent 143 child deaths/year, 
or 28% of annual rotavirus burden. The estimated national level ICER for 
rotavirus vaccination was $140/DALY, with regional socioeconomic subpopulation 
estimates ranging from $72/DALY for the poorest in the Central region to 
$353/DALY for the richest in the North region, indicating high 
cost-effectiveness. Within regions, ICERs are most favorable for children in the 
poorer and poorest quintiles. However, the full benefits of rotavirus 
vaccination will only be realized by reducing disparities in vaccination 
coverage, access to treatment, and environmental health. Improving vaccination 
coverage to equitable levels alone would prevent 87 additional child deaths per 
year.

Sophistry in American medicine? Platonic reflections on expertise, influence and 
the public's health in the democratic context.

Goldstein EV.

Without question, the American medical craft-the physicians, clinicians and 
healthcare organisations that comprise the American healthcare sector-provides 
immense value to patients and contributes expertise on matters relevant to the 
public's health. However, several conspicuous realities about healthcare in 
America should give the reader pause. Most problematic are the comparative 
measures of access to care, quality of care, life expectancy, racial health 
disparity and cost, all of which demonstrate how many Americans experience 
relatively lower value public health than other Western liberal democratic 
states. Since the early 1900s, American medical craft behaviour contributed to 
suboptimal social investment in public health, successfully influencing greater 
medical investment and higher healthcare expenditure relative to social welfare 
investments. Today, American policymakers seek the 'holy grail', a mythical 
panacea that purports to restrict spending and improve care quality and value, 
leading the USA to chase 'technocratic solutions to political problems'. This 
paper explores the claim that the USA is hampered by suboptimal public health 
decision making. Public health decision making has been historically impacted by 
the overextended reach of medical craft expertise-technê in Platonic terms of 
art-as permitted by the American democratic political system. American 
policymakers must not forget that the debate over technê, epistêmê, sophistry 
and who should have authority in public affairs is not new. Rather, it is an 
ancient debate, and now as then, the ancient arguments remain relevant in a 
democratic context. For particularly helpful insight, one ought to look no 
further than the lessons of Plato's dialogues. Platonic lessons on expertise and 
decision making can enlighten our understanding of modern public health decision 
making, specifically regarding the appropriation, allocation and distribution of 
health-related resources in the state.

For a long time, the discussion about animal testing vs its alternatives 
centered on animal welfare. This was a static warfare, or at least a gridlock, 
where life scientists had to take a position and make their value choices and 
hardly anyone changed sides. Technical advances have changed the frontline 
somewhat, with in vitro and in silico methods gaining more ground. Only more 
recently has the economic view begun to have an impact: Many animal tests are 
simply too costly, take too long, and give misleading results. As an extension 
and update to previous articles in this series written a decade ago, we 
reanalyze the economic landscape of especially regulatory use of animal testing 
and this time also consider respective alternative tests. Despite some ambiguity 
and data gaps, which we have filled with crude estimates, a picture emerges of 
globally regulated industries that are subject to stark geographic and sectorial 
differences in regulation, which determine their corresponding animal use. Both 
animal testing and its alternatives are industries in their own right, offering 
remarkable business opportunities for biotech and IT companies as well as 
contract research organizations. In light of recent revelations as to the 
reproducibility and relevance issues of many animal tests, the economic 
consequences of incorrect results and the reasons for still maintaining often 
outdated animal test approaches are discussed.

Although it was presumed that moderate exercise is a healthy practice but long 
term high intensity exercise is not, studies observed a life expectancy benefit 
for both high-intensity endurance and fast power sports athlets, but the data 
for contact sports are conflicting. Therefore, the author aimed to investigate 
the life expectancy of Olympic wrestling champions in comparison to the general 
population. Characteristics, vital status and life-span of the male Olympic 
wrestling champions was collected (1896-2016). The life expectancy of Olympic 
champions was compared with matched individuals of the general population (by 
country, age, and year of birth) obtained from the human mortality database ( 
http://www.mortality.org ). Overall, 341 male Olympic wrestling champions with 
median age of 25 (IQR 24-28) years at their Olympic victory were included in 
this analysis. In total, 142 (41.6%) came of rich countries. The survival was 
not affected by weight class and country of origin. A significant life 
expectancy benefit for Olympic champions in comparison to the general population 
was observed. Male Olympic wrestling champions lived in mean 19.1 ± 19.1 years 
longer than the matched individuals of the general population (respectively of 
their country of origin). A substantially lower mortality in male Olympic 
wrestling champions, compared with the general male population was observed. 
However, the results do not allow us to draw conclusions about the causes of 
this survival benefit.

Strong primary health care systems are essential for implementing universal 
health coverage and fulfilling health rights entitlements, but disagreement 
exists over how best to create them. Comparing countries with similar histories, 
lifestyle practices, and geography but divergent health outcomes can yield 
insights into possible mechanisms for improvement. Rwanda and Burundi are two 
such countries. Both faced protracted periods of violence in the 1990s, leading 
to significant societal upheaval. In subsequent years, Rwanda's improvement in 
health has been far greater than Burundi's. To understand how this divergence 
occurred, we studied trends in life expectancy following the periods of 
instability in both countries, as well as the health policies implemented after 
these conflicts. We used the World Bank's World Development Indicators to assess 
trends in life expectancy in the two countries and then evaluated health policy 
reforms using Walt and Gilson's framework. Following both countries' 
implementation of health sector policies in 2005, we found a statistically 
significant increase in life expectancy in Rwanda after adjusting for GDP per 
capita (14.7 years, 95% CI: 11.4-18.0), relative to Burundi (4.6 years, 95% CI: 
1.8-7.5). Strong public sector leadership, investments in health information 
systems, equity-driven policies, and the use of foreign aid to invest in local 
capacity helped Rwanda achieve greater health gains compared to Burundi.

Inequitable Physical Illness and Premature Mortality for People with Severe 
Mental Illness in Australia: A Social Analysis.

Health Network in Mount Barker, South Australia.

Australians with severe mental illness experience inequitably high rates of 
physical illness and shortened life expectancy compared to the general 
population. A social analysis of this phenomenon incorporating a precis of 
historical and contemporary public health approaches reveals persistent 
discrimination and entrenched social disadvantage influencing access to 
appropriate physical health care. People with severe mental illness in Australia 
are among the most vulnerable and marginalized populations in society, with 
fragmented and inadequate health and social services materially influencing 
their physical health status and longevity. Enhanced multi-sectoral 
collaboration, integrated physical and mental health care models, empowerment 
strategies, and privileging of a lay perspective within program design are 
critical to challenging this enduring infringement on the human right to health.
