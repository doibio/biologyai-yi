Women in almost all modern populations live longer than men. Research to date 
provides evidence for both biological and social factors influencing this gender 
gap. Conditions when both men and women experience extremely high levels of 
mortality risk are unexplored sources of information. We investigate the 
survival of both sexes in seven populations under extreme conditions from 
famines, epidemics, and slavery. Women survived better than men: In all 
populations, they had lower mortality across almost all ages, and, with the 
exception of one slave population, they lived longer on average than men. Gender 
differences in infant mortality contributed the most to the gender gap in life 
expectancy, indicating that newborn girls were able to survive extreme mortality 
hazards better than newborn boys. Our results confirm the ubiquity of a female 
survival advantage even when mortality is extraordinarily high. The hypothesis 
that the survival advantage of women has fundamental biological underpinnings is 
supported by the fact that under very harsh conditions females survive better 
than males even at infant ages when behavioral and social differences may be 
minimal or favor males. Our findings also indicate that the female advantage 
differs across environments and is modulated by social factors.

Many physiological changes occur with aging. These changes often, directly or 
indirectly, result in a deterioration of the quality of life and even in a 
shortening of life expectancy. Besides increased levels of reactive oxygen 
species, DNA damage and cell apoptosis, another important factor affecting the 
aging process involves a systemic chronic low-grade inflammation. This condition 
has already been shown to be interrelated with several (sub)clinical conditions, 
such as insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Recent 
evidence, however, shows that chronic low-grade inflammation also contributes to 
the loss of muscle mass, strength and functionality, referred to as sarcopenia, 
as it affects both muscle protein breakdown and synthesis through several 
signaling pathways. Classic interventions to counteract age-related muscle 
wasting mainly focus on resistance training and/or protein supplementation to 
overcome the anabolic inflexibility from which elderly suffer. Although the 
elderly benefit from these classic interventions, the therapeutic potential of 
anti-inflammatory strategies is of great interest, as these might add up 
to/support the anabolic effect of resistance exercise and/or protein 
supplementation. In this review, the molecular interaction between inflammation, 
anabolic sensitivity and muscle protein metabolism in sarcopenic elderly will be 
addressed.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular thrombectomy improves functional outcome in large 
vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. We examined disability, quality of life, 
survival and acute care costs in the EXTEND-IA trial, which used CT-perfusion 
imaging selection.
METHODS: Large vessel ischemic stroke patients with favorable CT-perfusion were 
randomized to endovascular thrombectomy after alteplase versus alteplase-only. 
Clinical outcome was prospectively measured using 90-day modified Rankin scale 
(mRS). Individual patient expected survival and net difference in 
Disability/Quality-adjusted life years (DALY/QALY) up to 15 years from stroke 
were modeled using age, sex, 90-day mRS, and utility scores. Level of care 
within the first 90 days was prospectively measured and used to estimate 
procedure and inpatient care costs (US$ reference year 2014).
RESULTS: There were 70 patients, 35 in each arm, mean age 69, median NIHSS 15 
(IQR 12-19). The median (IQR) disability-weighted utility score at 90 days was 
0.65 (0.00-0.91) in the alteplase-only versus 0.91 (0.65-1.00) in the 
endovascular group (p = 0.005). Modeled life expectancy was greater in the 
endovascular versus alteplase-only group (median 15.6 versus 11.2 years, 
p = 0.02). The endovascular thrombectomy group had fewer simulated DALYs lost 
over 15 years [median (IQR) 5.5 (3.2-8.7) versus 8.9 (4.7-13.8), p = 0.02] and 
more QALY gained [median (IQR) 9.3 (4.2-13.1) versus 4.9 (0.3-8.5), p = 0.03]. 
Endovascular patients spent less time in hospital [median (IQR) 5 (3-11) days 
versus 8 (5-14) days, p = 0.04] and rehabilitation [median (IQR) 0 (0-28) versus 
27 (0-65) days, p = 0.03]. The estimated inpatient costs in the first 90 days 
were less in the thrombectomy group (average US$15,689 versus US$30,569, 
p = 0.008) offsetting the costs of interhospital transport and the thrombectomy 
procedure (average US$10,515). The average saving per patient treated with 
thrombectomy was US$4,365.
CONCLUSION: Thrombectomy patients with large vessel occlusion and salvageable 
tissue on CT-perfusion had reduced length of stay and overall costs to 90 days. 
There was evidence of clinically relevant improvement in long-term survival and 
quality of life.

Novel, Anti-hTNF-α Variable New Antigen Receptor Formats with Enhanced 
Neutralizing Potency and Multifunctionality, Generated for Therapeutic 
Development.

The management of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel 
disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis has significantly improved over the 
last decade with the clinical availability of anti-TNF-α biologics. Despite this 
undoubted treatment success, a combination of acquired resistance together with 
an increased risk of systemic complications, means that a significant number of 
patients either fail to find a suitable targeted therapy or frustratingly 
discover that an approach that did work is no longer efficacious. Here, we 
report the isolation and characterization of a new class of super-neutralizing 
anti-TNF-α biologics formats, the building blocks of which were originally 
derived as variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) domains from an immunized nurse 
shark. These parental small, stable VNAR monomers recognize and neutralize tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, in cell-based assays, at nanomolar concentrations. 
However, the simple, single-chain molecular architecture of VNARs allows for 
easy and multiple reformatting options. Through reformatting, we achieved a 
50,000-fold enhancement in in vitro efficacy with super-neutralizing fusion 
proteins able to block TNF-α induced cytotoxicity in the 2-5 pM range while 
retaining other functionality through the addition of fusion proteins known to 
extend serum half-life in vivo. In an in vitro intestinal epithelial barrier 
dysfunction efficacy model, the lead VNAR domains, restored barrier function and 
prevented paracellular flux with comparable efficacy to adalimumab (Humira®). In 
addition, all multivalent VNAR constructs restored trans-epithelial electrical 
resistance (TEER) to approximately 94% of the untreated control. Reformatted 
VNAR domains should be considered as a new class of biologic agents for the 
treatment of hTNF-α driven diseases; either used systemically with appropriate 
half-life extension or alternatively where site-specific delivery of small and 
stable neutralizers may provide improvements to current therapy options.

BACKGROUND: Addressing the burden of poor physical health and the subsequent gap 
in life expectancy experienced by people with mental illness is a major priority 
in mental health services. To equip mental health staff with the competence to 
deliver evidence-based interventions, targeted staff training regarding 
metabolic health is required. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of staff 
training regarding metabolic health, we aimed to develop a succinct measure to 
determine the barriers, attitudes, confidence, and knowledge of health 
practitioners through the development and test-retest reliability of the 
Metabolic-Barriers, Attitudes, Confidence, and Knowledge Questionnaire (M-BACK).
METHODS: The M-BACK questionnaire was developed to evaluate the impact of 
specialized training in metabolic health care for mental health nurses. Content 
of the M-BACK was developed from a literature review and refined by an expert 
review panel and validated via a piloting process. To determine the test-retest 
reliability of the M-BACK, 31 nursing students recruited from the University of 
Notre Dame, Sydney completed the questionnaire on two separate occasions, 7 days 
apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for the total 
score, as well as each of the four domains.
RESULTS: Pilot testing was undertaken with a sample of 106 mental health nurses 
with a mean age 48.2, ranging from 24 to 63 years of age, who participated in 
six training courses. Questionnaire development resulted in a 16-item 
instrument, with each item is scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 
"strongly disagree" to "strongly agree." Test-retest reliability of the M-BACK 
was completed by 30 of 31 nursing students recruited, ICCs ranged from 0.62 to 
0.96.
CONCLUSION: The M-BACK is a reliable measure of the key elements of practitioner 
perceptions of barriers, and their knowledge, attitudes, and confidence 
regarding metabolic monitoring in people with mental illness. It can be used to 
assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing uptake of 
metabolic monitoring, a key component of programs to reduce the life expectancy 
gap in people living with severe mental illness.

By 2050, the American 85 years old and over population will triple. Clinicians 
and the public health community need to develop a culture of sensitivity to the 
needs of this population and its subgroups. Sensory changes, cognitive changes, 
and weakness may be subtle or may be severe in the heterogeneous population of 
people over age 85. Falls, cardiovascular disease, and difficulty with 
activities of daily living are common but not universal. This paper reviews 
relevant changes of normal aging, diseases, and syndromes common in people over 
age 85, cognitive and psychological changes, social and environmental changes, 
and then reviews common discussions which clinicians routinely have with these 
patients and their families. Some hearing and vision loss are a part of normal 
aging as is decline in immune function. Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis 
and dementia are common chronic conditions at age 85. Osteoarthritis, diabetes, 
and related mobility disability will increase in prevalence as the population 
ages and becomes more overweight. These population changes have considerable 
public health importance. Caregiver support, services in the home, assistive 
technologies, and promotion of home exercise programs as well as consideration 
of transportation and housing policies are recommended. For clinicians, 
judicious prescribing and ordering of tests includes a consideration of life 
expectancy, lag time to benefit, and patient goals. Furthermore, healthy 
behaviors starting in early childhood can optimize quality of life among the 
oldest-old.

MD2, a 160-residue accessory glycoprotein, is responsible for the recognition 
and binding of Gram-negative bacterial membrane component, lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). Internalization of pathogen inside the mononuclear phagocytes has also 
been attributed to MD2 which leads to the clearance of pathogens from the host. 
However, not much is known about the segments in MD2 that are responsible for 
LPS interaction or internalization of pathogen inside the defense cells. A 
16-residue stretch (MD54) from MD2 protein has been identified that possesses a 
short heptad repeat sequence and four cationic residues enabling it to 
participate in both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with LPS. An MD54 
analog of the same size was also designed in which a leucine residue at a 
heptadic position was replaced with an alanine residue. MD54 but not its analog, 
MMD54 induced aggregation of LPS and aided in its internalization within THP-1 
monocytes. Furthermore, MD54 inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of 
NF-κB in PMA-treated THP-1 and TLR4/MD2/CD14-transfected HEK-293T cells and the 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, in in vivo experiments, 
MD54 showed marked protection and survival of mice against LPS-induced 
inflammation and death. Overall, we have identified a short peptide with heptad 
repeat sequence from MD2 that can cause aggregation of LPS and abet in its 
internalization within THP-1 cells, resulting in attenuation of LPS-induced 
pro-inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo.

PURPOSE: Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer with 
effective antiretroviral therapies and are enjoying near normal life span. 
Therefore, they are encountering endocrine issues faced by the general 
population along with those specific to HIV infection. The purpose of this 
article is to review the common endocrine aspects of HIV infection, and the 
early detection and management strategies for these complications.
METHODS: Recent literature on HIV and endocrine disease was reviewed.
RESULTS: HIV can influence endocrine glands at several levels. Endocrine 
glandular function may be altered by the direct effect of HIV viral proteins, 
through generation of systemic and local cytokines and the inflammatory response 
and via glandular involvement with opportunistic infections and HIV-related 
malignancies. Endocrine disorders seen in people with HIV include metabolic 
issues related to obesity such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, lipohypertrophy, 
lipoatrophy and lipodystrophy and contribute significantly to quality of life, 
morbidity and mortality. In addition, hypogonadism, osteopenia and osteoporosis 
are also more prevalent in the patients with HIV. Although disorders of 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis resulting in adrenal insufficiency can be 
life threatening, these along with thyroid dysfunction are being seen less 
commonly in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. ARTs have greatly improved 
life expectancy in people living with HIV but can also have adverse endocrine 
effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for endocrine 
abnormalities in people with HIV as they can be potentially life threatening if 
untreated. Endocrine evaluation should be pursued as in the general population, 
with focus on prevention, early detection and treatment to improve quality of 
life and longevity.

Tackling the health impacts of climate change in the twenty-first century.

(1)a School of Medicine , University Of Dundee , Dundee , UK.

The turn of the twenty-first century has borne witness to the seemingly 
relentless march of climate change, with global mean temperatures and sea levels 
projected to rise significantly in the near future. Despite considerable 
improvements in healthcare, mortality rates and life expectancy worldwide over 
the past few decades, there is increasing evidence postulating the potentially 
adverse impacts of environmental alterations on health in more ways than one. 
These not only involve direct and indirect climatic-related health impacts, but 
also those modulated by human aspects. Undeniably, there is a pressing need to 
recognize these issues and come up with appropriate solutions to address them as 
much as possible. Fortunately, this has led to the development of a wide range 
of measures encompassing both adaptation and mitigation strategies, alongside 
the recent Paris accords which highlight renewed global resolve in tackling 
these challenges in a collaborative and coordinated manner. However, progress 
has been relatively muted, and whether these prove to be the turning point 
remains very much to be seen. Nonetheless, taking the above into consideration, 
there is little doubt about the gravity of the situation, and that much more 
needs to be done to integrate and bring society forward in this new era.

Lupus is an autoimmune disease affecting the connective tissue. Its clinical and 
biological polymorphism is often misunderstood by patients and families and can 
lead to treatment interruption and a decision to turn to alternative medicine. 
We used a questionnaire to assess the degree of knowledge of this disease of 
family members living with lupus patients. Of the 56 lupus patients receiving 
regular follow-up at our hospital, 123 members of 30 of their families (53.5%) 
participated. Overall, among these families, 81.5% of the participants perceived 
the disease as predominantly non-mystical, 72.3% as hereditary, 87.9% as 
non-contagious, and 60.9% as curable ; 90.2% considered it compatible with 
pregnancy, another 90.2% with work, and 73.9% with sports activity. The 
principal clinical signs mentioned involved joint (22.7%), skin (13%), and 
finger-related (11.3%) disorders, with renal disease (9.7%), heart disease 
(8.1%), and general signs (8.1%) mentioned most frequently as the main 
complications. The best-known medications for disease control were 
corticosteroids (20.3%) and hydroxychloroquine (17%). Family members considered 
non-adherence (53.6%) the most frequent factor in disease flares. More than half 
were unaware of the life expectancy associated with this disease, but 30.1 % 
thought it was lower than that of the national population of Gabon - 70 years. 
Only 64 (52%) of the respondents had seen documentation about lupus, mostly 
through the Internet (65.6%). Lupus is not a disease that families know and 
understand well.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Floseal, a 
topically applied hemostatic agent, and nasal packing for the management of 
epistaxis in Canada.
STUDY DESIGN: Outcomes research, a cost-utility analysis.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the costs and health outcomes of 
Floseal with nasal packing over a lifetime horizon from the perspective of a 
publicly funded healthcare system. A cycle length of 1 year was used. Efficacy 
of Floseal and packing was sought from the published literature. Unit costs were 
gathered from a hospital case costing system, whereas physician fees were 
extracted from the Ontario Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services. Results 
were expressed as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained. A series of one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: From the perspective of a publicly funded health are system, the 
Floseal treatment strategy was associated with higher costs ($2,067) and greater 
QALYs (0.27) than nasal packing. Our findings were highly sensitive to discount 
rates, the cost of Floseal, and the cost of nasal packing. The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis suggested that the probability that Floseal treatment is 
cost-effective reached 99% if the willingness-to-pay threshold was greater than 
$120,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies have demonstrated Floseal to be an effective 
treatment for anterior epistaxis. In the Canadian healthcare system, Floseal 
treatment appears to be a cost-effective treatment option compared to nasal 
packing for anterior epistaxis.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of epilepsy is higher in people with intellectual 
disability (ID) and increases with the degree of ID. Although life expectancy 
for people with ID is increasing, people with ID coexisting with epilepsy have a 
higher mortality rate, particularly those who had recent seizures. There have 
been few observational studies of the prevalence and patterns of anti-epileptic 
prescribing among older people with ID and epilepsy. The aim of this study was 
to investigate prevalence and patterns of anti-epileptic prescribing in the 
treatment of epilepsy in a representative population of older people with ID and 
epilepsy.
METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study from wave 1 (2009/2010) 
of Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging, 
a nationally representative sample of 753 persons with ID aged between 41 and 
90 years. Participants and/or proxies recorded medicines used on a regular basis 
and reported doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy; medication data were available for 
736 (98%). Prescribing of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for epilepsy in those with 
a doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy (N = 205) was the primary exposure of interest 
for this study. Participant exposure to these AEDs was then categorised into AED 
monotherapy and polytherapy. Participants/carers reported seizure frequency, 
when epilepsy was last reviewed and which practitioner reviewed epilepsy. In 
addition, medications that may lower the seizure threshold that were listed in 
the Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry were examined.
RESULTS: Of the 736 participants with reported medicines use, 38.9% (n = 287) 
were exposed to AEDs, and 30.6% (225) had a doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy. Of 
those with epilepsy (n = 225), 90.9% (n = 205) reported concurrent use of AEDs 
and epilepsy. Of these 205 participants, 50.3% (n = 103) were exposed to AED 
polytherapy, and 63 different polytherapy regimes were reported. The most 
frequently reported AEDs were valproic acid (n = 100, 48.7%), carbamazepine 
(n = 89, 46.3%) and lamotrigine (n = 57, 27.8%). In total, 13.7% had a 
concurrent psychotropic, which should be avoided in epilepsy, and 32.6% had a 
psychotropic where caution is required. Antipsychotics with potential 
epileptogenic potential accounted for 80% of these medications. Of those with 
AED polytherapy (n = 103), 29.5% (28) reported being seizure free for the 
previous 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of epilepsy was high among older people with ID, and 
half were exposed to two or more AEDs. Despite the use of AED therapy, over half 
had seizures in the previous 2 years. As the primary goals of optimal AED 
treatment are to achieve seizure freedom without unacceptable adverse effects, 
this was not achievable for many older patients with ID and epilepsy. Our 
findings indicated that people with ID and epilepsy were often exposed to 
psychotropic medications that may lower the seizure threshold. Regular review of 
epilepsy and medicines (including medicines that may interact with AEDs or lower 
the seizure threshold) by multidisciplinary teams working to agreed standards 
may improve quality of prescribing. Improved exchange of information and 
coordination of care between specialists and primary care practitioners in line 
with expert consensus recommendations could bring substantial benefit.

Mastocytosis - pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment.

Wagner N(1), Staubach P(2).

The term mastocytosis designates a group of rare disorders characterized by 
typical skin lesions, frequently associated episodes of anaphylaxis, and 
clinical symptoms related to the release of various mediators. 
Dermatologists/allergists are frequently the first to establish the diagnosis. 
The condition is based on clonal mast cell proliferation, usually in the skin or 
bone marrow and only rarely in the gastrointestinal tract or other tissues. In 
general, mastocytosis has a good prognosis in terms of life expectancy. Rare 
variants - including mast cell leukemia, aggressive mastocytosis, and the 
exceedingly rare mast cell sarcoma - require cytoreductive therapy. In cases 
associated with hematological neoplasms, the prognosis depends on the underlying 
hematologic disorder.

Isokinetic profile of subjects with the ruptured anterior cruciated ligament.

[No authors listed]

BACKGROUND/AIM: All changes in the knee that appear after anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) lesion lead to difficulties in walking, running, jumping 
especially during sudden changes of the line of movement. This significantly 
impairs quality of life of these subjects and leads to decrease in physical 
activity. Knee injuries make 5% of all most severe acute sport injuries. The aim 
of the study was to determine strength of the thigh muscles in persons with 
unilateral rupture of the ACL and to evaluate potential bilateral differences 
between healthy and injured leg.
METHODS: This study involved 114 male athletes of different sport specialities 
with the clinical diagnosis of ACL rupture. Each subject had unilateral ACL 
rupture and the other leg was actually the control for this research. An 
isokinetic device was used to evaluate the muscle strength of thigh muscles. 
Testing was performed for two testing speeds, 60º/s and 180º/s.
RESULTS: Data analysis showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) 
between the ACL and the healthy leg in the following parameters: peak torque for 
thigh extensors (Ptrq_E), angle to peak torque during extension (Ang_E), power 
of extension (Pow_E) and work during extension (Work_E). Analysing hamstrings to 
quadriceps (H/Q) ratio we found the unilateral disbalance of thigh muscle 
strength in ACL leg.
CONCLUSION: A high level of validity makes isokinetic dynamometry the method for 
evaluation of thigh muscles strength and leaves this field of research open for 
new studies in order to improve both diagnostic and rehabilitation of patients 
with the insufficient ACL.

BACKGROUND: observational studies have shown that nutritional strategies to 
manage malnutrition may be cost-effective in aged care; but more robust economic 
data is needed to support and encourage translation to practice. Therefore, the 
aim of this systematic review is to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing nutrition interventions targeting malnutrition in aged care homes 
versus usual care.
SETTING: residential aged care homes.
METHODS: systematic literature review of studies published between January 2000 
and August 2017 across 10 electronic databases. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and 
GRADE were used to evaluate the quality of the studies.
RESULTS: eight included studies (3,098 studies initially screened) reported on 
11 intervention groups, evaluating the effect of modifications to dining 
environment (n = 1), supplements (n = 5) and food-based interventions (n = 5). 
Interventions had a low cost of implementation (<£2.30/resident/day) and 
provided clinical improvement for a range of outcomes including weight, 
nutritional status and dietary intake. Supplements and food-based interventions 
further demonstrated a low cost per quality adjusted life year or unit of 
physical function improvement. GRADE assessment revealed the quality of the body 
of evidence that introducing malnutrition interventions, whether they be 
environmental, supplements or food-based, are cost-effective in aged care homes 
was low.
CONCLUSION: this review suggests supplements and food-based nutrition 
interventions in the aged care setting are clinically effective, have a low cost 
of implementation and may be cost-effective at improving clinical outcomes 
associated with malnutrition. More studies using well-defined frameworks for 
economic analysis, stronger study designs with improved quality, along with 
validated malnutrition measures are needed to confirm and increase confidence 
with these findings.

Recent hypertension clinical trials and national guideline updates have created 
a debate on the most appropriate treatment goals in elderly patients with 
hypertension. In 2014, recommendations by the Eighth Joint National Committee 
allowed a more lenient goal for patients 60 years and older compared with 
previous guidelines. Since then, several large clinical trials and meta-analyses 
have added more information regarding strict versus lenient treatment goals. 
Most recently, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association 
Task Force published their highly anticipated hypertension guideline developed 
in conjunction with nine additional interdisciplinary organizations. This review 
discusses the culmination of emerging data to provide more insight into the 
treatment of hypertension in the elderly. A literature search was conducted 
using PubMed, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, the Cochrane 
database, and by hand-searching references from relevant articles. The following 
key terms were used: hypertension, blood pressure, systolic, and elderly. 
Available literature suggests that it is reasonable to target an office systolic 
blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg in elderly patients with hypertension. An 
individualized approach is reasonable for those who are institutionalized, with 
high comorbidity burden, or have a short life expectancy. A diastolic blood 
pressure of less than 60 mm Hg should be avoided due to the potential for an 
increase in cardiovascular risk. The method of blood pressure measurement is 
extremely important to consider when determining the blood pressure goal, and 
proper procedures for accurate blood pressure measurement must be followed. 
Other factors important to consider may include the patient's comorbidities, 
frailty, as well as the patient's potential for adverse drug reactions.

Currently, there is debate among the liver transplant community regarding the 
most appropriate mechanism for organ allocation: urgency-based (MELD) versus 
utility-based (survival benefit). We hypothesize that MELD and survival benefit 
are closely associated, and therefore, our current MELD-based allocation already 
reflects utility-based allocation. We used generalized gamma parametric models 
to quantify survival benefit of LT across MELD categories among 74 196 adult 
liver-only active candidates between 2006 and 2016 in the United States. We 
calculated time ratios (TR) of relative life expectancy with transplantation 
versus without and calculated expected life years gained after LT. LT extended 
life expectancy (TR > 1) for patients with MELD > 10. The highest MELD was 
associated with the longest relative life expectancy (TR = 1.05 1.201.37 for 
MELD 11-15, 2.29 2.492.70 for MELD 16-20, 5.30 5.726.16 for MELD 21-25, 15.12 
16.3517.67 for MELD 26-30; 39.26 43.2147.55 for MELD 31-34; 120.04 128.25137.02 
for MELD 35-40). As a result, candidates with the highest MELD gained the most 
life years after LT: 0.2, 1.5, 3.5, 5.8, 6.9, 7.2 years for MELD 11-15, 16-20, 
21-25, 26-30, 31-34, 35-40, respectively. Therefore, prioritizing candidates by 
MELD remains a simple, effective strategy for prioritizing candidates with a 
higher transplant survival benefit over those with lower survival benefit.

A long-standing problem in ageing research is to understand how different 
factors contributing to longevity should be expected to act in combination under 
the assumption that they are independent. Standard interaction analysis compares 
the extension of mean lifespan achieved by a combination of interventions to the 
prediction under an additive or multiplicative null model, but neither model is 
fundamentally justified. Moreover, the target of longevity interventions is not 
mean life span but the entire survival curve. Here we formulate a mathematical 
approach for predicting the survival curve resulting from a combination of two 
independent interventions based on the survival curves of the individual 
treatments, and quantify interaction between interventions as the deviation from 
this prediction. We test the method on a published data set comprising survival 
curves for all combinations of four different longevity interventions in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that interactions are generally weak even when 
the standard analysis indicates otherwise.

AIMS: Access to Critical Cerebral Emergency Support Services (ACCESS) was 
developed as a low-cost solution to providing neuro-emergent consultations to 
rural hospitals in New Mexico that do not offer comprehensive stroke care. 
ACCESS is a two-way audio-visual program linking remote emergency department 
physicians and their patients to stroke specialists. ACCESS also has an 
education component in which hospitals receive training from stroke specialists 
on the triage and treatment of patients. This study assessed the clinical and 
economic outcomes of the ACCESS program in providing services to rural New 
Mexico from a healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed using findings from the ACCESS 
program and existing literature, the likelihood that a patient will receive a 
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), cost of care, and resulting quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Data from the ACCESS program includes emergency room 
patients in rural New Mexico from May 2015 to August 2016. Outcomes and costs 
have been estimated for patients who were taken to a hospital providing 
neurological telecare and patients who were not.
RESULTS: The use of ACCESS decreased neuro-emergent stroke patient transfers 
from rural hospitals to urban settings from 85% to 5% (no tPA) and 90% to 23% 
(tPA), while stroke specialist reading of patient CT/MRI imaging within 3 h of 
onset of stroke symptoms increased from 2% to 22%. Results indicate that use of 
ACCESS has the potential to save $4,241 ($3,952-$4,438) per patient and increase 
QALYs by 0.20 (0.14-0.22). This increase in QALYs equates to ∼73 more days of 
life at full health. The cost savings and QALYs are expected to increase when 
moving from a 90-day model to a lifetime model.
CONCLUSION: The analysis demonstrates potential savings and improved 
quality-of-life associated with the use of ACCESS for patients presenting to 
rural hospitals with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

OBJECTIVE: The individual enabling and support (IES) model was effective in 
gaining competitive employment for people with affective disorders compared with 
traditional vocational rehabilitation (TVR) services in a randomized controlled 
trial in a Swedish setting. The object of this study is to perform a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of IES comparing to TVR.
METHODS: We considered the costs of intervention and productivity gain due to 
increased competitive employment. We estimated quality of life using EuroQol 5 
Dimension (EQ-5D) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) 
scale. EQ-5D was translated into quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), using the 
UK, Danish, and Swedish tariffs. We performed the analysis from a societal 
perspective with a one-year timeframe.
RESULTS: The cost of IES was €7247 lower per person per year (2014 prices) 
compared to TVR. There were no significant differences in QALY improvement 
within or between groups. However, quality of life measured by the MANSA scale 
significantly improved over the study period in IES.
LIMITATIONS: Besides the small sample size, details on the intervention costs 
for both IES and TVR group were unavailable and had to be obtained from external 
sources.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of IES for people with affective disorders is most 
likely cost-saving and is potentially even dominating TVR, although a larger 
trial is required to establish this.

BACKGROUND: Building on an approach applied to cardiovascular and cancer 
research, we estimated the economic returns from United Kingdom public- and 
charitable-funded musculoskeletal disease (MSD) research that arise from the net 
value of the improved health outcomes in the United Kingdom.
METHODS: To calculate the economic returns from MSD-related research in the 
United Kingdom, we estimated (1) the public and charitable expenditure on 
MSD-related research in the United Kingdom between 1970 and 2013; (2) the net 
monetary benefit (NMB), derived from the health benefit in quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs) valued in monetary terms (using a base-case value of a QALY of 
£25,000) minus the cost of delivering that benefit, for a prioritised list of 
interventions from 1994 to 2013; (3) the proportion of NMB attributable to 
United Kingdom research; and (4) the elapsed time between research funding and 
health gain. The data collected from these four key elements were used to 
estimate the internal rate of return (IRR) from MSD-related research investments 
on health benefits. We analysed the uncertainties in the IRR estimate using a 
one-way sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Expressed in 2013 prices, total expenditure on MSD-related research 
from 1970 to 2013 was £3.5 billion, and for the period used to estimate the rate 
of return, 1978-1997, was £1.4 billion. Over the period 1994-2013 the key 
interventions analysed produced 871,000 QALYs with a NMB of £16 billion, 
allowing for the net NHS costs resulting from them and valuing a QALY at 
£25,000. The proportion of benefit attributable to United Kingdom research was 
30% and the elapsed time between funding and impact of MSD treatments was
