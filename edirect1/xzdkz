Parasitism-generated negative effects on ant societies are multifaceted, 
implying individual and colony-level responses. Though laboratory based evidence 
shows that the sublethal fungus Rickia wasmannii is responsible for 
physiological and behavioral responses that may negatively affect individual 
workers' resilience and life expectancy in Myrmica ant workers, colony-level 
stress response to this parasite is largely unknown. Here, we focus on 
understanding of a long-term, colony-level effect of Rickia infection on Myrmica 
scabrinodis ant populations by tracking trait size-based changes. We collected 
worker specimens from infected and uninfected colonies from the same population 
in order to: (1) compare body size in response to parasitism, (2) assess the 
extent to which possible changes in size are associated with the severity of 
infection, and (3) investigate shifts in body size in response to infection over 
time by testing correlation of workers' ages and sizes. We found that workers 
from infected colonies were significantly smaller than their healthy congeners, 
but neither infection level nor the age of the workers showed significant 
correlation with the size in infected colonies. Decreasing body sizes in 
infected colonies can be ascribed to workers' mediated effect toward developing 
larvae, which are unable to attain the average body size before they pupate.

Healthy Life Years (HLY) is a prominent summary indicator for evaluating and 
comparing the levels of population health status across Europe. Variations in 
HLY, however, do not necessarily reflect underlying differences in health and 
mortality levels among countries and the indicator is particularly sensitive 
when broken down by subpopulations. For instance, despite European countries 
showing large HLY inequalities by educational level, these countries are also 
heterogenous regarding their population composition by educational attainment, 
which most likely affects their HLY levels. We demonstrate how this 
compositional effect shapes HLY levels by providing estimates for HLY by 
educational attainment and gender for 16 European countries using the Sullivan 
method. We use prevalence data about limitations in daily activities from the 
European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and 
mortality data from the Eurostat database. Finally, we adjust for compositional 
effects by means of standardization. The education-adjusted HLY estimates do not 
differ much from conventional HLY. Yet, we find that in some countries HLY 
levels are indeed affected by the population composition by educational 
attainment. For example, low-, medium-, and high educated individuals in 
Portugal show more HLY than their counterparts in Poland. Still, Poland's total 
HLY value slightly exceeds that of Portugal, indicating favorable health and 
mortality conditions in Poland. It is Poland's lower relative number of low 
educated individuals in its population that is responsible for producing this 
higher total HLY value. We conclude that differentials in HLY due to differences 
in the relative size of educational subpopulations are generally small in HLY 
across Europe but they can play an important role for countries that experienced 
large differences in their educational expansion.

Background: The objective of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of PCV13 vs. PPV23 and no vaccination and PPV23 vs. no vaccination in 
adults aged ≥ 60 years with underlying medical conditions which put them at an 
elevated risk of pneumococcal disease in a Japanese healthcare setting.Research 
design and methods: A natural history model was developed with a life-long time 
horizon and 1-year cycle length, with microsimulation as a modeling technique. 
The expected costs from a public payer's and societal perspective, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and prevented cases and deaths caused by 
IPD (invasive pneumococcal disease) and NBP (non-bacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia) were estimated.Results: In the base-case scenario, the cost per QALY 
gained from a public payer's perspective for PCV13 vs, PPV23 and no vaccination 
were 500,255JPY and 1,139,438JPY, respectively, The cost per QALY gained for 
PPV23 vs no vaccination was 1,687,057JPY. Over the life-long time horizon for 1 
million patients, when compared to PPV23, PCV13 resulted in 65 fewer IPD cases, 
2,894 fewer NBP cases, and 384 fewer deaths caused by pneumococcal 
disease.Conclusions: In adults aged 60 years and over with underlying medical 
conditions, PCV13 was shown to be a more cost-effective alternative to PPV23.

Reassessing the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for the treatment of renal cell 
carcinoma based on mature survival data, updated safety and lower comparator 
price.

Aims: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab 
versus everolimus for second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based 
on mature data, updated safety and decreased everolimus price.Materials and 
methods: A 3-state (pre-progression/progression-free disease, progressive 
disease and death) Markov model was developed from the perspective of the 
Australian health care system. Two scenarios were tested. Scenario 1 used 
30-months clinical data and scenario 2 used updated 80-months clinical data with 
updated everolimus price. Inputs for quality-of-life and costs were informed by 
the literature and government sources. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained was reported and an ICER 
threshold of AU$75,000 was assumed. Threshold analysis was performed, and 
uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.Results: In scenario 1, the model estimated 1.73 QALYs at a cost of 
AU$105,000 for nivolumab and 1.48 QALYs at AU$38,000 for everolimus with an 
ICER = AU$266,871/QALY gained. A rebate of 54.4% was needed for nivolumab to 
reach the ICER threshold. For scenario 2, 1.93 QALYs at AU$111,418 was estimated 
for nivolumab and 1.60 QALYs at AU$31,942 for everolimus with an ICER of 
AU$213,320/QALY gained. The rebate needed to reach the ICER threshold was 54.9%. 
One-way sensitivity analyses for both scenarios showed that the cost of 
nivolumab, time horizon and utilities were main drivers. The cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves highlighted the differences in cost-effectiveness of the 
two scenarios, as well as significant uncertainty in the results.Conclusions: A 
54% rebate of the published price is needed for nivolumab to be cost-effective 
in Australia for the treatment of RCC. At that rebate, nivolumab remains 
cost-effective despite severe price erosion of everolimus because of improved 
longer term follow-up data. We recommend that generic price erosion should be 
accounted for when performing cost-effectiveness analysis.

Fifty years ago, David Baltimore published a brief conceptual paper delineating 
the classification of viruses by the routes of genome expression. The six 
"Baltimore classes" of viruses, with a subsequently added 7th class, became the 
conceptual framework for the development of virology during the next five 
decades. During this time, it became clear that the Baltimore classes, with 
relatively minor additions, indeed cover the diversity of virus genome 
expression schemes that also define the replication cycles. Here, we examine the 
status of the Baltimore classes 50 years after their advent and explore their 
links with the global ecology and biology of the respective viruses. We discuss 
an extension of the Baltimore scheme and why many logically admissible 
expression-replication schemes do not appear to be realized in nature. Recent 
phylogenomic analyses allow tracing the complex connections between the 
Baltimore classes and the monophyletic realms of viruses. The five classes of 
RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses share an origin, whereas both the 
single-stranded DNA viruses and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses evolved on 
multiple independent occasions. Most of the Baltimore classes of viruses 
probably emerged during the earliest era of life evolution, at the stage of the 
primordial pool of diverse replicators, and before the advent of modern-like 
cells with large dsDNA genomes. The Baltimore classes remain an integral part of 
the conceptual foundation of biology, providing the essential structure for the 
logical space of information transfer processes, which is nontrivially connected 
with the routes of evolution of viruses and other replicators.

Later-Life Living Arrangements of Americans With and Without Children: A Life 
Table Approach.

OBJECTIVES: This study describes living arrangement-specific life expectancy for 
older Americans with and without children, by sex and race/ethnicity.
METHOD: We use life tables from the Human Mortality Database and data from the 
Health and Retirement Study over a 17-year period (2000-2016) to calculate 
living arrangement-specific life expectancy at age 65 using Sullivan's method. 
Results describe the lives of older Americans aged 65 and older with and without 
children in terms of the number of expected years of life in different living 
arrangements.
RESULTS: With the exception of Hispanic men, older Americans without children 
spend over half of their remaining life living alone. Among the childless, it is 
White women and Black men who spend the largest percent of remaining life living 
alone (65% and 57%, respectively). Relative to parents, childless older 
Americans have an overall life expectancy at age 65 that is 1 year lower and 
spend 5-6 years more living alone and fewer years living with a spouse (8 years 
less for men and 5 years less for women). Childless older Americans spend more 
time in nursing homes, but average expected duration in this living arrangement 
is short and differences between those with and without children are small.
DISCUSSION: This descriptive analysis demonstrates the fundamental ways in which 
children shape the lives of older Americans by showing that later-life living 
arrangements of childless Americans differ markedly from their counterparts with 
children. These results provide a valuable empirical foundation for broader 
efforts to understand relationships between childlessness, living arrangements, 
and well-being at older ages.

Improvement in life expectancy of patients suffering from oncohematologic 
disorders has turned cancer from an acute into a chronic condition, making the 
management of comorbidities problematic, especially when it comes to both acute 
and chronic cardiovascular diseases. Treatment-related adverse events and 
drug-drug interactions often influence the therapeutic approach of patients with 
active malignancies and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, tumor cells and 
platelets maintain a complex crosstalk that on one hand enhances tumor 
dissemination and on the other hand induces hemostasis abnormalities. Hence, 
clinicians should move carefully in the intricate land mines established by 
patients with active cancer under antithrombotic therapy. To date, there is no 
consensus on the antithrombotic treatment of patients with cardiovascular 
diseases and concomitant malignancies. The aim of this review is to collect the 
available scientific evidence, including the latest clinical trials and 
guidelines, in order to provide guidance on the management of antithrombotic 
treatment (both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy) in cancer patients with 
either pre-existent or new-onset coronary artery disease. Randomized-controlled 
trials on antithrombotic treatment in oncologic populations, which by far have 
thus far been excluded, have to be promoted to supply recommendations in the 
oncohematologic setting.

In this review paper, we discuss the characteristics that define severe 
bronchiectasis and which may lead to deterioration of noncystic fibrosis 
bronchiectasis. These characteristics were used to establish the current 
severity scores: bronchiectasis severity index (BSI), FACED, and E-FACED 
(exacerbation frequency, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, age, 
colonization, extension and dyspnea score). They can be used to predict 
mortality, exacerbation rate, hospital admission, and quality of life. 
Furthermore, there are different treatable traits that contribute to severe 
bronchiectasis and clinical deterioration. When present, they can be a target of 
the treatment to stabilize bronchiectasis.One of the first steps in treatment 
management of bronchiectasis is evaluation of compliance to already prescribed 
therapy. Several factors can contribute to treatment adherence, but to date no 
real interventions have been published to ameliorate this phenomenon. In the 
second step, treatment in deteriorating patients with bronchiectasis should be 
guided by the predominant symptoms, for example, cough, sputum, difficulty 
expectoration, exacerbation rate, or physical impairment. In the third step, we 
evaluate treatable traits that could influence disease severity in the 
deteriorating patient. Finally, in patients who are difficult to treat despite 
maximum medical treatment, eligibility for surgery (when disease is localized), 
should be considered. In case of end-stage disease, the evaluation for lung 
transplantation should be performed. Noninvasive ventilation can serve as a 
bridge to lung transplantation in patients with respiratory failure.

BACKGROUND: The chronic and progressive evolution of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases 
(IBD), with its prototypical fluctuating trend, creates a condition of 
psycho-social discomfort, impacting the quality of life in terms of personal, 
working, and interpersonal.
AIMS: In this article, we want to identify the nature and extent of the research 
evidence on the life experiences, the perceived engagement, the psychological, 
social care and welfare needs of people affected by IBD across the lifecycle.
METHODS: Following the approach set out by Arksey and O'Malley and the PRISMA 
extension for scoping reviews, we conducted a scoping review in March 2019 and 
closed the review with an update in October 2019. It was performed using 
electronic databases covering Health and Life Sciences, Social Sciences and 
Medical Sciences, such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of 
Science, PsycInfo.
RESULTS: We identified 95 peer-reviewed articles published from 2009 to 2019, 
that allowed to detection the main needs in children (psychological, need to be 
accepted, physical activity, feeding, parent style, support, social needs), 
adolescents (to understand, physical and psychological needs, protection, 
relational, gratitude, respect, and engagement) and adults (information, 
medical, psychological, social, work-related, practical, future-related, 
engagement). Although the literature confirms that the majority of the IBD units 
have planned provision for the different types of transitions, the quality and 
appropriateness of these services have not been assessed or audited for all the 
kinds of challenges across the life cycle.
CONCLUSIONS: The literature shows the relevance of organizing a flexible, 
personalized health care process across all the critical phases of the life 
cycle, providing adequate benchmarks for comparison in a multidisciplinary 
perspective and ensuring continuity between hospital and territory.

INTRODUCTION: Work is integral to the occupations of human beings and accounts 
for up to a third of time spent in an average adult life. Occupational 
therapists play a role in vocational rehabilitation of mental health service 
users (MHSUs) with the aim of optimising their work participation. It is 
advisable that occupational therapists providing vocational rehabilitation to 
MHSUs with chronic mental illness in mental healthcare settings are guided by a 
practice framework developed for that particular context. This scoping review 
aims to summarise existing evidence on vocational rehabilitation for MHSUs in 
low-income to upper-middle-income countries. The findings will inform subsequent 
phases of research undertaken to formulate a vocational rehabilitation practice 
framework for MHSUs in Namibia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review will employ the five stage 
methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. This will be used in 
conjunction with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews extension 
for Scoping Reviews (PRISM-ScR) and Joanna Briggs scoping review guidelines. 
MESH terms, Boolean operators and truncation strategies will be employed for a 
comprehensive article search in electronic scholarly databases. These databases 
will include PsycINFO, EBSCOhost, HINARI, Google scholar, Medline, CINAHL, 
PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct and Wiley Online Library. 
Mendeley and Rayyan, both open source platforms, will be used for title, 
abstract and full-text screening, as well as data extraction. Data will be 
sifted and sorted by key categories and themes using a data charting form.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scoping review findings will be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal and presented at local and international conferences. 
Ethical clearance for this study will not be required as secondary data will be 
utilised and there are no patients involved.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of active polyethylene film 
(PE) containing linalool and thymol active components on the microbial shelf 
life of mozzarella cheese. PE films containing different concentrations of 
linalool or thymol (0%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%) were prepared. The antimicrobial 
properties of the films were examined, and mozzarella cheese was packed with 
these active films. The antimicrobial properties of packed samples during 
30 days of storage were studied. The obtained results from film tests showed 
that by increasing the concentration of active agents (linalool and thymol) in 
PE films, the antimicrobial activities of film samples against Escherichia coli, 
Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, and Saccharomyces cervicea were 
increased. The cheese tests result demonstrated that mozzarella cheese packaging 
with PE films containing different concentrations of linalool and thymol leads 
to a decreased growth rate of molds and yeasts in cheeses. At the end of the 
storage period, the lowest number of molds and yeasts was for a sample packed in 
PE film containing 2% thymol, which increased from 1.00 to 1.21 Log CFU/g during 
the storage period. From E. coli and S. aureus contamination, the samples packed 
in active films were safe until the last day of storage (30th day), while the 
control sample was unacceptable at 17th day of storage. According to obtained 
results from this study, it was concluded that the addition of linalool and 
thymol active components to PE film had a positive effect on the extension of 
the mozzarella scheese shelf life.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic testing for respiratory tract infections is a tool to 
manage the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the rising incidence of 
antimicrobial resistance. At the same time, new European regulations for market 
entry of in vitro diagnostics, in the form of the in vitro diagnostic 
regulation, may lead to more clinical evidence supporting health-economic 
analyses.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to review the methods 
used in economic evaluations of applied diagnostic techniques, for all patients 
seeking care for infectious diseases of the respiratory tract (such as 
pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, influenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, sore 
throats and general respiratory tract infections).
METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, articles from three large databases of 
scientific literature were included (Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed) for the 
period January 2000 to May 2020.
RESULTS: A total of 70 economic analyses are included, most of which use 
decision tree modelling for diagnostic testing for respiratory tract infections 
in the community-care setting. Many studies do not incorporate a generally 
comparable clinical outcome in their cost-effectiveness analysis: fewer than 
half the studies (33/70) used generalisable outcomes such as quality-adjusted 
life-years. Other papers consider outcomes related to the accuracy of the test 
or outcomes related to the prescribed treatment. The time horizons of the 
studies generally are limited.
CONCLUSIONS: The methods to economically assess diagnostic tests for respiratory 
tract infections vary and would benefit from clear recommendations from policy 
makers on the assessed time horizon and outcomes used.

University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.

As a common lethal disease, cancer is now responsible for the majority of deaths 
worldwide and has been the single most important barrier to increasing life 
expectancy in the world. The pathogenesis of cancer has been the key point of 
cancer therapeutics research. The primary cilium, a solitary microtubule-based 
organelle, is considered to be an important sensor for receiving mechanical and 
chemical stimulation from other cells and environments; it plays an important 
role in a variety of signal transduction and disease processes. More 
importantly, the primary cilium can also function as an elaborate structure to 
regulate cell proliferation because ciliogenesis regulates cell division by 
sequestering the centriole. Recently, many new findings have suggested that the 
length and incidence of the primary cilium are closely connected to 
carcinogenesis and responses to cancer therapy. Here, we review relevant 
evidences proving that the primary cilium plays a key role in the occurrence and 
treatment of cancer. We also summarize the primary cilium-associated signaling 
pathways in cancer, including Wnt signaling, Hedgehog signaling, PDGFR 
signaling, and Notch signaling, and anticipate that targeting proteins localized 
in the primary cilium may be a potential anti-cancer strategy.

Economics and Administrative Sciences, Turkey.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to group European countries according to life 
expectancy at birth and to determine the impact of economic growth and financial 
indicators on European country groups.
METHOD: This study planned and conducted by using life expectancy at birth time 
series, economic growth and financial development indicators data for the period 
of 1980 to 2015. European countries are classified in terms of life expectancy 
(LE) at birth time series data from 1980 to 2015 by using hierarchical 
clustering analysis method. Random Forest and Classification and Regression Tree 
(CART) algorithm was used to examine predictors of European country groups in 
terms of long-term LE time series data by using economic growth and financial 
development indicators.
RESULTS: The results of this study show that Eastern and Western countries are 
mostly in two different clusters in terms of long-term LE time series. This 
study sheds light on the difference between Eurosceptic countries and other 
European countries. This study revealed that inflation in consumer prices, which 
is an indicator of economic growth, outperforms financial development indicators 
to predict country groups in terms of long-term life expectancy at birth data.
CONCLUSION: Countries in the same cluster may have similar problems and 
solutions in their health care systems. Priority should be given to health 
problems that adversely affect the life expectancy of the countries in the same 
cluster in order to raise the quality of life and extend life expectancy in the 
European continent.

Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) experience a 10- to 25-year 
reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. Early mortality 
for people with SMI has mainly been attributed to unhealthy behaviors (e.g., 
poor diet, sedentary lifestyle), which has led to the development of health 
promotion and self-management interventions specifically for people with SMI to 
promote health behavior change. Yet after decades of research, the mortality gap 
between people with SMI and the general population is increasing. To address 
this early mortality disparity for individuals with SMI, a new paradigm must be 
explored. In this article, we present the social processes impacting early 
mortality in people with SMI paradigm, which highlights the powerful role of 
social processes in shaping the health and health behaviors of people with SMI. 
This paradigm explores how loneliness, stigma (social and self), trauma, social 
exclusion, social isolation, and social norms are related to early mortality in 
people with SMI. This new paradigm is an important step in understanding and 
potentially addressing early mortality in people with SMI.

Among hypothetical cohorts of older osteoporotic women without prior fragility 
fracture in Japan, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two treatment 
strategies using a simulation model. Annual intravenous zoledronic acid for 
3 years was cost-saving compared with biannual subcutaneous denosumab for 
3 years followed by weekly oral alendronate for 3 years.
PURPOSE: Osteoporosis constitutes a major medical and health economic burden to 
society worldwide. Injectable treatments for osteoporosis require less frequent 
administration than oral treatments and therefore have higher persistence and 
adherence with treatment, which could explain better efficacy for fracture 
prevention. Although annual intravenous zoledronic acid and biannual 
subcutaneous denosumab are available, it remains unclear which treatment 
strategy represents a better value from a health economic perspective. 
Accordingly, we examined the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid for 3 years 
compared with sequential denosumab/alendronate (i.e., denosumab for 3 years 
followed by oral weekly alendronate for 3 years, making the total treatment 
duration 6 years) among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling osteoporotic 
women without prior fragility fracture in Japan at ages 65, 70, 75, or 80 years.
METHODS: Using a previously validated and updated Markov microsimulation model, 
we obtained incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (Japanese yen [¥] (or US 
dollars [$]) per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) from the public healthcare 
and long-term care payer's perspective over a lifetime horizon with a 
willingness-to-pay of ¥5 million (or $47,500) per QALY.
RESULTS: In the base case, zoledronic acid was cost-saving (i.e., more effective 
and less expensive) compared with sequential denosumab/alendronate. In 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to changes in the 
efficacy of zoledronic acid or the cumulative persistence rate with zoledronic 
acid or denosumab. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of 
zoledronic acid being cost-effective were 98-100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older osteoporotic women without prior fragility fracture in 
Japan, zoledronic acid was cost-saving compared with sequential 
denosumab/alendronate.

Numerous experimental life-history studies on aging are mainly baised on two 
classical models-fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) and nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans (Maupas)-with relatively little attention given to other 
organisms with different life-history characters. Two-spotted spider mite 
Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) differs from many other 
arthropods in that the females continue their growth in the early adult stage 
and can reproduce sexually and asexually. In this study, the influences of 
dietary restriction and delayed mating on the aging patterns of the spider mite 
were examined with the prevailing survival and reproduction trade-off hypothesis 
of aging being tested. Significant sex-specific responses of the spider mites 
were found. The females showed longevity extension on diet restriction (fasting 
for 2 days in every 4 days) compared with their counterparts being fed ad 
libitum, and after delayed mating for 9 days, while the males displayed a 
decrease in lifespan when experiencing diet restriction but were not 
significantly influenced by delayed mating. Path analysis was used to 
investigate the relationship between mite survival and reproduction traits, 
including longevity, female lifetime reproduction, age at first reproduction, 
early reproductive efforts and late reproductive efforts, yielding no evidence 
for trade-offs between these life-history traits. The additive effects of 
dietary restriction and delayed mating in lifespan extension of female spider 
mites were confirmed, proving that diet restriction is a robust anti-aging 
intervention, and that later onset of reproduction can prolong adult lifespan in 
females.

Essential oils (EOs) are valuable products commonly employed in the food 
industry and intensively studied as biopreservatives for the extension of food 
shelf-life. Unfortunately, EOs might be counterfeit to increase industrial 
profits. Among the possible adulterants, vegetable oils (VOs) must be considered 
for their characteristics and low costs. We aimed to apply nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for the detection and identification of VOs in 
mixtures with EOs. This innovative strategy is based on comparing the peak area 
ratio matrices of characteristic VO 13C NMR fatty acid signals with those of 
adulterated EOs. The identification of the VOs was achieved by calculating the 
matrix similarity at different confidence levels. The strategy demonstrated the 
capacity to efficiently recognize the presence of adulteration and the type of 
VO adulterant in mixtures. Thus, the method was applied to 20 commercial EOs, 
and VOs were detected and then identified in four samples.

BACKGROUND: Since 2010, large reductions in funding for local government 
services have been introduced in England. These reductions in funding have 
potentially led to reduced provision of health-promoting public services. We 
aimed to investigate whether areas that showed a greater decline in funding also 
had more adverse trends in life expectancy and premature mortality.
METHODS: In this longitudinal ecological study, we linked annual data from the 
Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government on local government 
revenue expenditure and financing to 147 upper-tier local authorities in England 
between 2013 and 2017 with data from Public Health England, on male and female 
life expectancy at birth, male and female life expectancy at age 65 years, and 
premature (younger than 75 years) all-cause mortality rate for male and female 
individuals. Local authorities were excluded if their populations were too small 
or if changes in boundaries meant consistent data were not available. Using 
multivariable fixed-effects panel regression models, and controlling for local 
socioeconomic conditions, we estimated whether changes in local funding from 
2013 were associated with changes in life expectancy and premature mortality. We 
included a set of alternative model specifications to test the robustness of our 
findings.
FINDINGS: Between 2013 and 2017, mean per-capita central funding to local 
governments decreased by 33% or £168 per person (range -£385 to £1). Each £100 
reduction in annual per person funding was associated over the study period 
2013-17 with an average decrease in life expectancy at birth of 1·3 months (95% 
CI 0·7-1·9) for male individuals and 1·2 months (0·7-1·7) for female 
individuals; for life expectancy at age 65 years, the results show a decrease of 
0·8 months (0·3-1·3) for male individuals and 1·1 months (0·7-1·5) for female 
individuals. Funding reductions were greater in more deprived areas and these 
areas had the worst changes in life expectancy. We estimated that cuts in 
funding were associated with an increase in the gap in life expectancy between 
the most and least deprived quintiles by 3% for men and 4% for women. Overall 
reductions in funding during this period were associated with an additional 9600 
deaths in people younger than 75 years in England (3800-15 400), an increase of 
1·25%.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that cuts in funding for local government 
might in part explain adverse trends in life expectancy. Given that more 
deprived areas showed greater reductions in funding, our analysis suggests that 
inequalities have widened. Since the pandemic, strategies to address these 
adverse trends in life expectancy and reduce health inequalities could 
prioritise reinvestment in funding for local government services, particularly 
within the most deprived areas of England.

Appetite is closely regulated not only by gut hormonal and neuronal peptides but 
also by exogenous peptides derived from food proteins. Food proteins are now 
recognized to contain many thousands of bioactive compounds that provide 
additional health benefits beyond their nutritional effects. Bioactive peptides 
are beneficial to the life and/or to regulate physiological functions. Although 
animal protein products have been widely applied in the food industry, exploring 
the possibilities of developing functional foods based on plant protein-derived 
peptides is considered attractive for achieving sustainable development goals. 
In addition, peptides from plant proteins have the potential to treat numerous 
diseases or risk factors and may therefore facilitate a healthy life expectancy. 
In this review, we discuss the identified plant-based bioactive peptides and 
their appetite regulating effects. Plant-based bioactive peptides may provide 
new opportunities to discover novel approaches that can improve and prevent 
diseases in a sustainable environment.
