(PROMIS®) has developed self-efficacy item banks for managing chronic 
conditions, but lacks a general self-efficacy measure. We sought to refine and 
validate an item-response theory (IRT)-based measure of general self-efficacy 
for PROMIS®.
METHODS: Ten items were modified from the NIH Toolbox® Self-Efficacy Item Bank 
by creating "confidence" response options, and administered to a general 
population sample (n = 1000) with the Toolbox® Self-Efficacy Item Bank, Life 
Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale 
(GESS). We split the sample in half for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) 
followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). IRT analyses included evaluation 
of differential item functioning (DIF).
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 47.8 years and 50.3% were male. EFA 
showed all items loaded onto one dominant factor and CFA yielded a good fitting 
model for a general self-efficacy bank with confidence response options 
(CFI = 0.987, TLI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.090). Items showed no evidence of DIF by 
gender, age, education, or race. Internal consistency reliability was α = .94 
and .88 for a new 10-item general self-efficacy bank and 4-item short form, 
respectively. The new bank was correlated with the LOT-R (r = .58), the GESS 
(r = .55), and the Toolbox® Self-Efficacy Item Bank (r = .87).
CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS® General Self-Efficacy measure demonstrated sufficient 
unidimensionality and displayed good internal consistency reliability, model 
fit, and convergent validity. Further psychometric testing of the PROMIS® 
General Self-Efficacy Item Bank and Short Form can evaluate its utility in 
people with chronic health conditions.

BACKGROUND: Venous ulceration is a common and costly health-care issue 
worldwide, with poor healing rates greatly affecting patient quality of life. 
Compression bandaging has been shown to improve healing rates and reduce 
recurrence, but does not address the underlying cause, which is often 
superficial venous reflux. Surgical correction of the reflux reduces ulcer 
recurrence; however, the effect of early endovenous ablation of superficial 
venous reflux on ulcer healing is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
compression therapy with early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux 
compared with compression therapy with deferred endovenous ablation in patients 
with venous ulceration.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, two-arm, multicentre, parallel-group, open randomised 
controlled trial with a health economic evaluation.
SETTING: Secondary care vascular centres in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a venous leg ulcer of between 6 
weeks' and 6 months' duration and an ankle-brachial pressure index of ≥ 0.8 who 
could tolerate compression and were deemed suitable for endovenous ablation of 
superficial venous reflux.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to either early ablation 
(compression therapy and superficial endovenous ablation within 2 weeks of 
randomisation) or deferred ablation (compression therapy followed by endovenous 
ablation once the ulcer had healed).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was time from randomisation 
to ulcer healing, confirmed by blinded assessment. Secondary outcomes included 
24-week ulcer healing rates, ulcer-free time, clinical success (in addition to 
quality of life), costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). All analyses 
were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
RESULTS: A total of 450 participants were recruited (224 to early and 226 to 
deferred superficial endovenous ablation). Baseline characteristics were similar 
between the two groups. Time to ulcer healing was shorter in participants 
randomised to early superficial endovenous ablation than in those randomised to 
deferred ablation [hazard ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.68; 
p = 0.001]. Median time to ulcer healing was 56 (95% CI 49 to 66) days in the 
early ablation group and 82 (95% CI 69 to 92) days in the deferred ablation 
group. The ulcer healing rate at 24 weeks was 85.6% in the early ablation group, 
compared with 76.3% in the deferred ablation group. Median ulcer-free time was 
306 [interquartile range (IQR) 240-328] days in the early ablation group and 278 
(IQR 175-324) days in the deferred endovenous ablation group (p = 0.002). The 
most common complications of superficial endovenous ablation were pain and 
deep-vein thrombosis. Differences in repeated measures of Aberdeen Varicose Vein 
Questionnaire scores (p < 0.001), EuroQol-5 Dimensions index values (p = 0.03) 
and Short Form questionnaire-36 items body pain (p = 0.05) over the follow-up 
period were observed, in favour of early ablation. The mean difference in total 
costs between the early ablation and deferred ablation groups was £163 [standard 
error (SE) £318; p = 0.607]; however, there was a substantial and statistically 
significant gain in QALY over 1 year [mean difference between groups 0.041 (SE 
0.017) QALYs; p = 0.017]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of early 
ablation at 1 year was £3976 per QALY, with a high probability (89%) of being 
more cost-effective than deferred ablation at conventional UK decision-making 
thresholds (currently £20,000 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses using alternative 
statistical models give qualitatively similar results.
LIMITATIONS: Only 7% of screened patients were recruited, treatment regimens 
varied significantly and technical success was assessed only in the early 
ablation group.
CONCLUSIONS: Early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux, in addition 
to compression therapy and wound dressings, reduces the time to healing of 
venous leg ulcers, increases ulcer-free time and is highly likely to be 
cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: Longer-term follow-up is ongoing and will determine if early 
ablation will affect recurrence rates in the medium and long term.

Plain Language Summary: Venous leg ulcers are open wounds occurring on the legs 
of patients with venous disease. They are common, painful and distressing and 
reduce patient quality of life. Leg ulcers often result from valves in the leg 
veins not working properly. The valves normally force blood back up towards the 
heart; however, blood can flow backwards (reflux) when valves do not work 
properly, and this can cause swelling and ulceration. Compression therapy 
(wrapping bandages around the legs) has been shown to help ulcers heal, but it 
does not treat the underlying reflux problem with the veins. Newer, less 
invasive, techniques (known as endovenous ablation) have taken over from surgery 
to correct venous reflux and are more acceptable to patients as they can be 
performed quickly under local anaesthetic. The aim of the trial was to find out 
if treating patients with leg ulcers by early endovenous ablation (within 2 
weeks) and standard compression therapy can increase ulcer healing compared with 
standard compression therapy and delayed endovenous ablation once the ulcer has 
healed. In total, 450 people agreed to take part in this study and were treated 
in 20 hospitals across England. Participants were randomly allocated to either 
early or delayed endovenous ablation and followed up for 12 months. The trial 
found that treating the veins early resulted in quicker ulcer healing than 
delaying treatment until the ulcer had healed. The trial also showed that 
participants had more time without an ulcer if the treatment was performed early 
rather than after ulcer healing. No safety issues with early intervention were 
identified. There is some evidence that quality of life was better in the early 
treatment group and that people in this group had less body pain. Treating 
ulcers early appears likely to be more cost-effective (i.e. a better use of NHS 
resources) than delayed treatment. Future work will focus on collecting 
longer-term follow-up data to find out if early endovenous ablation also reduces 
the chances of the ulcer coming back.

Fusion with an albumin-binding domain (ABD) of streptococcal protein G 
represents a popular approach for half-life extension of small protein 
therapeutics in the organism. To increase the circulation time of engineered 
αvβ3-integrin-binding protein (JCL) based on the 10th human fibronectin type III 
domain (10 Fn3), we have constructed several fusions with ABD with different 
orientations of the partner proteins and linker length. The recombinant proteins 
were expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified by nickel-affinity 
chromatography. All fusion proteins bound human serum albumin (HSA) in ELISA 
assay; however, fusions with longer linkers demonstrated better performance. 
Interaction of ABD-L15 -JCL and JCL-L14 -ABD with HSA was confirmed by 
analytical size exclusion chromatography and pull-down assays. Surprisingly, the 
thermal stability of ABD-L15 -JCL was dramatically decreased in comparison with 
JCL and JCL-L14 -ABD proteins. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that JCL-L14 
-ABD circulated in murine blood about 10 times longer than ABD-L15 -JCL and 960 
times longer than JCL. Biodistribution studies of JCL-L14 -ABD in mice revealed 
its increased level in blood and a decreased accumulation in liver and kidneys 
in comparison with JCL. Obtained results demonstrate the utility of the fusion 
with ABD for half-life extension of the binding proteins based on 10 Fn3.

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has 
significantly increased life expectancy and improved management of the human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) disease globally. This well-established 
treatment regime has shown to reduce viral capacity to undetectable limits when 
using traditional clinical assays. The establishment of viral reservoirs during 
the early stages of infection are the major contributors to failure of the 
current regimens to eradicate HIV-1 infection since the reservoirs are not 
affected by antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). Therefore, advanced modification of the 
present treatment and investigation of novel antiretroviral drug delivery system 
are needed. The aim of this study was to use femtosecond (fs) laser pulses to 
deliver ARVs into HIV-1 infected TZMbl cells. Different ARVs were translocated 
into TZMbl cells using fs pulsed laser (800 nm) with optimum power of 4 μW and 
10 ms laser to cell exposure time. Changes in cellular processes were evaluated 
using cellular morphology, viability, cytotoxicity and luciferase activity 
assays. Cells treated with the laser in the presence of ARVs showed a 
significant reduction in viral infectivity, cell viability and an increase in 
cytotoxicity. This study demonstrated that fs laser pulses were highly effective 
in delivering ARVs into HIV-1 infected TZMbl cells, causing a significant 
reduction in HIV-1 infection.

This study analyzes the impact of youth homicide (between 15 and 29 years of 
age) on male life expectancy in Mexico and its 32 states in the periods 
2004-2006 and 2014-2016, and identifies the factors that best explain the 
variations in the years of male life expectancy lost (YMLEL) due to youth 
homicide at the state level in 2014-2016. Based on official data, male temporary 
life expectancy (MTLE) between 0 to 85 years of age and years of male life 
expectancy lost, in total and due to youth homicide, were calculated in each 
three-year period. Through a linear regression analysis, factors associated with 
the variations of the years of male life expectancy lost due to youth homicide 
among states were identified. The male temporary life expectancy decreased 
between the three-year periods in the country and in 25 states; years of male 
life expectancy lost due to youth homicide increased in 31 states, in eight of 
them with a figure higher than 0.5 years in the 2014-2016 period. Factors such 
as the presence of drug trafficking, illegal firearms and the perception of 
insecurity explain the variations in the years of male life expectancy lost due 
to youth homicide within the Mexican states in the 2014-2016 period.

Mediante un análisis de regresión lineal, se identificaron factores asociados 
con las variaciones de los años de esperanza de vida masculina perdidos por 
homicidio juvenil entre estados. La esperanza de vida temporaria masculina 
decreció entre ambos trienios en el país y en 25 estados, mientras que los años 
de esperanza de vida masculina perdidos por homicidio juvenil se incrementaron 
en 31 estados, en ocho de ellos la cifra fue superior a 0,5 en 2014-2016. 
Factores como la presencia del narcotráfico, de armas de fuego ilegales y la 
percepción de inseguridad explican las variaciones de los años de esperanza de 
vida masculina perdidos por homicidio juvenil entre estados en 2014-2016.

BACKGROUND: The growing concern with environmental related impacts on mortality 
and morbidity means that the conceptual framework of environment-health-economic 
policy nexus is salient in the global debate on air pollution.
OBJECTIVES: With time series data spanning 2000-2016, this study explored the 
proximate determinants of ambient air pollution, mortality, and life expectancy 
in North America, Europe & Central Asia, and East Asia & Pacific regions.
METHODS: The study applied historical data on urban population, total pollution, 
energy consumption, GDP per capita, life expectancy, mortality rate and 
industrial PM2.5 emissions to develop six parsimonious models using the 
generalized least squares (GLS) random-effects model estimation with first-order 
autoregressive [AR(1)] disturbance across 54 countries.
RESULTS: An increase in income level by 1% declined mortality rate by 0.01% and 
increased longevity by ~0.02% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]) in the long-run. An 
increase in industrial PM2.5 emissions per capita by 1% decreased life 
expectancy by 0.004% and mortality rate by 0.02% (95% CI). Intensification of 
energy consumption and its related services by 1% were found to increase 
industrial PM2.5 emissions by 0.42-0.45% (95% CI). An inversed-U shaped curve 
between PM2.5 emissions per capita and income levels was found at a turning 
point of US$ 48,061. The validity of an environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis 
between ambient air pollution and urbanization was confirmed, while a rapid 
increase in population had a significant positive impact on ambient air 
pollution.
CONCLUSION: Ambient air pollution contributes significantly in reducing life 
expectancy and increasing mortality. However, sustained economic development, 
along with energy efficiency, and sustainable urban settlement planning and 
management are potential options for reducing ambient air pollution while 
improving quality of life and environmental sustainability.

Bioactive compounds, e.g., protein, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, 
vitamins and minerals, found in commercial form of microalgal biomass (e.g., 
powder, flour, liquid, oil, tablet, or capsule forms) may play important roles 
in functional food (e.g., dairy products, desserts, pastas, oil-derivatives, or 
supplements) or feed (for cattle, poultry, shellfish, and fish) with favorable 
outcomes upon human health, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
antimicrobial, and antiviral effects, as well as prevention of gastric ulcers, 
constipation, anemia, diabetes, and hypertension. However, scale up remains a 
major challenge before commercial competitiveness is attained. Notwithstanding 
the odds, a few companies have already overcome market constraints, and are 
successfully selling extracts of microalgae as colorant, or supplement for food 
and feed industries. Strong scientific evidence of probiotic roles of microalgae 
in humans is still lacking, while scarce studies have concluded on probiotic 
activity in marine animals upon ingestion. Limitations in culture harvesting and 
shelf life extension have indeed constrained commercial viability. There are, 
however, scattered pieces of evidence that microalgae play prebiotic roles, 
owing to their richness in oligosaccharides-hardly fermented by other members of 
the intestinal microbiota, or digested throughout the gastrointestinal tract of 
humans/animals for that matter. However, consistent applications exist only in 
the dairy industry and aquaculture. Despite the underlying potential in 
formulation of functional food/feed, extensive research and development efforts 
are still required before microalgae at large become a commercial reality in 
food and feed formulation.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, also called Gunther's disease, is a very 
rare genetic autosomal recessive diseaseaffecting less than 1 per 1,000,000 
children. Pathogenesis involves genetic mutation encoding uroporphyrinogen-III 
cosynthase which leads to accumulation of porphyrin in many tissues, leading to 
extreme skin photosensitivity, red cell lysis, splenomegaly and reduced life 
expectancy. Herein, we report a 12-year mentally challenged girl with multiple 
blisters and scars on sun exposed sites since birth. She had hepatomegaly, 
erythrodontia, severe anaemia with haemolytic blood picture and mildly elevated 
liver enzymes. Skin biopsy showed deposition of amorphous eosinophilic 
porphyrins in the dermis, thus confirming a diagnosis of congenital 
erythropoietic porphyria.

BACKGROUND: Oral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supplementation increases growth 
hormone (GH) serum levels and protein synthesis. Therefore, post-exercise 
supplementation using GABA and protein may help enhance training-induced muscle 
hypertrophy. We evaluated whether GABA with whey protein enhanced muscular 
hypertrophy in men after progressive resistance training.
METHODS: Twenty-one healthy men (26 - 48 years) were randomized to receive whey 
protein (WP; 10 g) or whey protein + GABA (WP + GABA; 10 g + 100 mg) daily for 
12 weeks. Both groups performed resistance training twice per week (three sets 
of 12 repetitions at 60% of maximal strength; leg press, leg extension, leg 
curl, chest press, and pull down). Body composition was assessed using 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS: In the WP + GABA group, resting plasma GH concentrations were 
significantly elevated at 4 and 8 weeks, compared to baseline. However, resting 
plasma GH concentrations in the WP group were only significantly elevated at 8 
weeks. After 12 weeks, the WP + GABA group exhibited significantly greater

CONCLUSIONS: The GABA and whey protein combination was more effective for 
increasing whole body fat-free mass; daily GABA supplementation may help enhance 
exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy.

Albeta, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The number of older persons in Sub-Saharan Africa is increasing.
AIMS: What can Sub-Saharan Africa learn from other countries that may enhance 
the health and wellness of older persons? Canada was conveniently selected as 
the country which has endorsed the need for action on active ageing, given that 
by 2026, 1 in every 5 Canadians will have reached the age of 65 years and 4% of 
the overall population will be 85 years and older.
METHODS: English language electronic searches of computerized databases (PubMed, 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO) were done to locate relevant published 
studies on Canada, from January 2000 to August 2014. Keyword combination 
included: physical activity/activities, exercise/s, older person/s, elderly, 
ageing adults, seniors, and older people.
RESULTS: 8 out of 400 plus articles were reviewed, and 4 key approaches in 
ensuring active ageing in Canada were identified. From these, 5 public 
health-oriented plans are recommended for Sub-Saharan Africa: (1) there should 
be a shift in the conceptualisation of what physical activity entails, (2) it is 
necessary to build and strengthen collaboration between various stakeholders 
involved in planning, (3) raising awareness among older persons and the general 
population on the benefits in participating in physical activity, (4) encourage 
older persons to participate in culturally relevant physical activity, and (5) 
laying a better foundation for future generations of older persons.
CONCLUSION: Though more elaborate planning is required, these recommended plans 
will contribute to achieving average life expectancy beyond 60 years in 
Sub-Saharan Africa.

Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

CONTEXT: There are numerous factors which affect the health status in different 
ways, including financing mechanisms, health-care expenditures, socioeconomic 
characteristics, and health-care resources. One of the most important factors 
which contribute to the health status of a population is health-care resource 
which includes number of beds or health-care professionals for instance.
AIMS: The objectives of this study were as follows: to examine the regression of 
the life expectancy and health-care inputs and also to investigate the 
regression of death rate and health-care inputs.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was a panel dataset analysis of OECD countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A generalized method of moment (GMM) regression models 
with country-level health outcomes (death rate and life expectancy) as dependent 
variables were estimated. A panel dataset with n = 26 (the number of countries) 
and T = 12 (the number of time periods) was used. The GMM regression model was 
used to estimate the effect of health-care resources on health outcomes.
RESULTS: Findings showed that there are strong reverse correlations between 
immunization rate and number of physicians with crude rate of death (-2.64 [P < 
001] and -76.50 [P < 001], respectively). There were also positive correlations 
between immunization rate and number of physicians with life expectancy at birth 
(0.01 [P < 001] and 1.03 [P < 001], respectively). Moreover, there were negative 
correlations between inpatient rate and beds with life expectancy (-0.00003 [P < 
001] and -0.12 [P < 001], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: It is essential for policymakers to consider the optimal level of 
health resource to achieve better health outcomes. Oversupply of hospital beds 
and specialist doctors could lead to induced demand and put the patients at risk 
of unnecessary procedures.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a high-volume surgery that is an 
end-stage treatment for gallstones. There is little understanding of the 
surgery's effect on the gain in patients' health relative to its cost. The 
objective of this study is to measure health gain, cost and cost utility of 
elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
METHODS: Participants completed the EQ-5D(3L) pre-operatively and 
post-operatively. Quality adjusted life years attributable to cholecystectomy 
were calculated by comparing health state utility values between the pre- and 
post-operative time points. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost was calculated 
from a health system perspective and included hospital and specialists' fees (in 
2016 Canadian dollars). Cost per QALY was calculated for the entire sample and 
demographic sub-groups.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 135 participants who completed surveys between 
February 2013 and June 2017. The response rate among eligible patients was 50%. 
Assuming that health gain accrued to the participant for 25 years after 
cholecystectomy, the mean gain in QALYs was 1.7430, corresponding to an average 
cost per QALY of $2102. Older patients, on average, had less gain in QALYs than 
younger patients.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are inexpensive relative to the gains 
in health they provide patients. The gains in health were not uniform across age 
categories. These results should provide health system planners confidence that 
incremental increases in surgical capacity for elective cholecystectomies is 
beneficial.

The atrioventricular (AV) node generates half of the AV delay needed for blood 
pumping and filters atrial impulses that could otherwise induce life-threatening 
ventricular arrhythmias. It is also a pacemaker and a key target in the 
treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The special roles of the AV node primarily 
arise from its slow conduction, long refractory period, and cellular 
automaticity. However, efforts to establish the dynamics of these properties and 
their interaction led to many controversies. In fact, the AV node's behavior is 
so complex that it seems to escape broadly applicable rules. This review 
summarizes progresses made in resolving these issues and in integrating the 
multiple roles of the AV node within a common functional model. Presented 
evidence shows that the rate-dependent conduction and refractory properties of 
the AV node can be reliably characterized and reconciled from nodal responses to 
S1 S2 S3 protocols. It also supports the concept that dual pathways constitute a 
feature of the normal AV node and account for its overall conduction and 
refractory properties. In this model, the posterior extension and compact node 
provide the core of the slow and fast pathway, respectively. The transitional 
tissues and lower nodal bundle provide a common proximal and distal pathway, 
respectively. These pathways would also support bidirectional conduction. The 
dual pathway involvement can also be extended to widely variable AV nodal 
responses, such as Wenckebach cycles, hysteresis, and ventricular response to 
atrial fibrillation. In brief, the intricate AV nodal behavior may obey a 
limited set of accessible and definable rules.

We present a quantum mechanical model capable of describing isotropic 
compression of single atoms in a non-reactive neon-like environment. Studies of 
93 atoms predict drastic changes to ground-state electronic configurations and 
electronegativity in the pressure range of 0-300 GPa. This extension of atomic 
reference data assists in the working of chemical intuition at extreme pressure 
and can act as a guide to both experiments and computational efforts. For 
example, we can speculate on the existence of pressure-induced polarity (red-ox) 
inversions in various alloys. Our study confirms that the filling of energy 
levels in compressed atoms more closely follows the hydrogenic aufbau principle, 
where the ordering is determined by the principal quantum number. In contrast, 
the Madelung energy ordering rule is not predictive for atoms under compression. 
Magnetism may increase or decrease with pressure, depending on which atom is 
considered. However, Hund's rule is never violated for single atoms in the 
considered pressure range. Important (and understandable) electron shifts, s→p, 
s→d, s→f, and d→f are essential chemical and physical consequences of 
compression. Among the specific intriguing changes predicted are an increase in 
the range between the most and least electronegative elements with compression; 
a rearrangement of electronegativities of the alkali metals with pressure, with 
Na becoming the most electropositive s1 element (while Li becomes a p group 
element and K and heavier become transition metals); phase transitions in Ca, 
Sr, and Ba correlating well with s→d transitions; spin-reduction in all d-block 
atoms for which the valence d-shell occupation is d n (4 ≤ n ≤ 8); d→f 
transitions in Ce, Dy, and Cm causing Ce to become the most electropositive 
element of the f-block; f→d transitions in Ho, Dy, and Tb and a s→f transition 
in Pu. At high pressure Sc and Ti become the most electropositive elements, 
while Ne, He, and F remain the most electronegative ones.

BACKGROUND: In CARE-MS II (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif® Efficacy in 
Multiple Sclerosis; NCT00548405), alemtuzumab (12 mg/day; baseline: 5 days; 
12 months later: 3 days) significantly improved health-related quality of life 
(HRQL) outcomes versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFNB-1a) in 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients over 2 years. Patients 
completing CARE-MS II could enter a 4-year extension study (NCT00930553).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess 6-year HRQL outcomes in 
alemtuzumab-treated CARE-MS II patients, including those with highly active 
disease (HAD).
METHODS: During extension, patients could receive additional alemtuzumab for 
clinical/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity or other disease-modifying 
therapies per investigator's discretion. Assessments include Functional 
Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-36), and EQ-5D visual analog scale (EQ-VAS).
RESULTS: Alemtuzumab-treated patients improved or stabilized all HRQL measures 
over 6 years with significant improvements from baseline at all time points on 
EQ-VAS and for up to 5 years on FAMS, SF-36 MCS, and SF-36 PCS. 
Alemtuzumab-treated patients with HAD showed significant improvements versus 
baseline at Year 2 on all HRQL measures, and significant improvements versus SC 
IFNB-1a on SF-36 PCS and EQ-VAS; however, the improvements did not reach the 
threshold for clinical relevance.
CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab-treated CARE-MS II patients improved or stabilized HRQL 
versus baseline over 6 years. This is the first study to show long-term HRQL 
benefits in patients with HAD.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Apert syndrome is characterized by the presence of 
multisuture craniosynostosis, midface retrusion, and syndactyly of the hands 
with fusion of the second through fourth nails. Almost all affected individuals 
have coronal craniosynostosis, and a majority also have involvement of the 
sagittal and lambdoid sutures. The midface in Apert syndrome is underdeveloped 
as well as retruded; a subset of affected individuals have cleft palate. The 
hand in Apert syndrome always includes fusion of the middle three digits; the 
thumb and fifth finger are sometimes also involved. Feeding issues, dental 
abnormalities, hearing loss, hyperhidrosis, and progressive synostosis of 
multiple bones (skull, hands, feet, carpus, tarsus, and cervical vertebrae) are 
also common. Multilevel airway obstruction may be present and can be due to 
narrowing of the nasal passages, tongue-based airway obstruction, and/or 
tracheal anomalies. Nonprogressive ventriculomegaly is present in a majority of 
individuals, with a small subset having true hydrocephalus. Most individuals 
with Apert syndrome have normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability; 
moderate-to-severe intellectual disability has been reported in some 
individuals. A minority of affected individuals have structural cardiac 
abnormalities, true gastrointestinal malformations, and anomalies of the 
genitourinary tract.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Apert syndrome is established in a proband 
with classic clinical characteristics (multisuture craniosynostosis, midface 
retrusion, and syndactyly) and/or by the identification of a heterozygous 
pathogenic variant in FGFR2 by molecular genetic testing AND phenotypic features 
consistent with Apert syndrome.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Management by a craniofacial team is 
ideal. In general, multisutural craniosynostosis should be surgically repaired 
in the first year of life; jaw surgery to advance the midface often occurs in 
childhood and adolescence. Cleft palate repair may be performed prior to the 
development of pressure consonants. Feeding therapy is often helpful. Pediatric 
dental care is recommended. Treatment of strabismus should be performed by an 
ophthalmologist with expertise in eye alignment in children with 
craniosynostosis. Hearing aids may be required for hearing loss. If airway 
obstruction is present, temporizing measures may be required. Treatment of sleep 
apnea by surgical intervention and/or supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula may 
be required. The type and timing of surgical repair for syndactyly depends on 
the presence of thumb syndactyly and extent of soft tissue deficiency. Early 
intervention services for speech abnormalities and developmental delay should be 
initiated. Standard treatment of congenital heart defects, malrotation, 
cryptorchidism in males, hydronephrosis, acne, and scoliosis should be 
instituted when appropriate. Prevention of secondary complications: Timely 
surgical treatment of craniosynostosis may prevent increased intracranial 
pressure that can lead to papilledema and cognitive impairment; ocular 
lubricants to prevent exposure keratopathy and corneal scarring; anesthesia 
evaluation before any surgical intervention to prevent perioperative respiratory 
complications; spine precautions and consultation with a spine surgeon to 
prevent spinal cord injury and neurologic sequelae in those with cervical spine 
anomalies. Clinical feeding evaluation and/or video fluoroscopic swallow study 
is needed to determine if precautions are required to prevent aspiration 
pneumonia and subsequent chronic lung disease. Surveillance: Measurement of head 
circumference and fontanelle size and assessment for increased intracranial 
pressure at each appointment in infancy and early childhood; assessment of 
developmental progress at each visit; evaluation by a craniofacial team 
regularly in infancy, childhood, and adolescence; dental care every six months; 
assessment for velopharyngeal insufficiency after emergence of language; 
assessment for speech disorders, ophthalmologic evaluation, and 
audiologic/otologic assessments at least annually; evaluation for the 
development of scoliosis annually in childhood and adolescence. 
Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports and activities that involve neck 
hyperflexion or extension for those with cervical spine anomalies; factors that 
potentiate hearing loss; use of CPAP/BiPAP for long-term treatment of sleep 
apnea. Pregnancy management: For affected pregnant women: monitoring for signs 
and symptoms of worsening obstructive sleep apnea and anethesia evaluation prior 
to initiation of labor to identify any multilevel airway anomalies or vertebral 
anomalies that would result in additional risk with certain types of anesthesia; 
fiberoptic intubation could be required.
GENETIC COUNSELING: Apert syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. 
However, most individuals with Apert syndrome have the disorder as the result of 
a de novo FGFR2 pathogenic variant. Advanced paternal age has been shown to be 
associated with de novo pathogenic variants for Apert syndrome. Affected 
individuals have a 50% chance of passing the pathogenic variant to each child. 
Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic 
variant has been identified in the family.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced, incurable cancer who understand their 
illness is incurable are more likely to prefer hospice care at the end of life 
compared with patients who believe their illness is curable. To the authors' 
knowledge, it is unclear whether patient-caregiver agreement regarding perceived 
prognosis is associated with hospice enrollment.
METHODS: The current study examined the prospective relationship between 
patient-caregiver agreement concerning perceived prognosis and hospice 
enrollment in the last 30 days of life. Data were collected during a cluster 
randomized controlled trial examining a communication intervention for 
oncologists and patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. At the time 
of study entry, patients and caregivers (141 dyads) were categorized as 
endorsing a "good" prognosis if they: 1) reported a >50% chance of surviving 
≥2 years; or if they 2) predicted that the patient's quality of life 3 months 
into the future would be ≥7 on an 11-point scale.
RESULTS: Approximately one-fifth of dyads agreed on a poor prognosis whereas 
approximately one-half disagreed regarding prognosis. In approximately one-third 
of dyads, patients and caregivers both believed the patient's future quality of 
life would be good (34%) and that the patient would live for ≥2 years (30%). 
Patients in these dyads were less likely to enroll in hospice compared with 
patients in dyads who disagreed and those who agreed on a shorter life 
expectancy and poor future quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Dyadic understanding of patients' projected life expectancy and 
future quality of life appears to be predictive of care received at the end of 
life. Improving rates of hospice enrollment may be best achieved with dyadic 
interventions.

Iron fertilizers are worthy to be studied due to alleviate the Fe deficiency. 
Different forms of iron oxide nanoparticles are selected to better understand 
possible particle applications as an Fe source for crop plants. In this study, 
we assessed the different effects of γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs on the physiology and 
fruit quality of muskmelon plants in a pot experiment for five weeks. Results 
showed that no increased iron content was found under NPs treatment in root, 
stem, leaf and fruit, except 400 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs had a higher iron content in 
muskmelon root. With the extension of NPs exposure, both γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs 
began to promote plant growth. In addition, γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs could increase 
chlorophyll content at a certain stage of exposure. Happily, 200 mg/L γ-Fe2O3 
NPs and 100, 200 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs significantly increased fruit weight of 
muskmelon by 9.1%, 9.4% and 11.5%. It is noteworthy that both γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 
NPs caused positive effects on VC content, particularly 100 mg/L Fe3O4 NPs 
increased the VC content by 46.95%. To the best of our knowledge, little 
research has been done on the effect of nanoparticles on the whole physiological 
cycle and fruit quality of melon. The assessment of physiology and fruit quality 
of muskmelon plants in vitro upon γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs exposure could lay a 
foundation for NPs potential impact at every growth period of muskmelon plants.
