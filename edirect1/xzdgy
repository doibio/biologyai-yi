AIM: To examine the long-term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a 
sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to treat type 1 diabetes, 
in the Japanese subpopulation of the DEPICT-2 study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with type 1 diabetes were randomized to 
dapagliflozin 5 mg (n = 55), dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 41) or placebo (n = 58) 
plus insulin for a 24-week, double-blind period followed by a 28-week, 
single-blind extension phase.
RESULTS: From baseline to 24 weeks, dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c compared with 
placebo (mean change of -0.58% and -0.80% for 5 and 10 mg, respectively), and an 
HbA1c reduction was observed up to 52 weeks. Compared with placebo, 
dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg increased the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c 
reductions of 0.5% or more without severe hypoglycaemia events and reduced 
glycaemic variability assessed via continuous glucose monitoring. Both 
dapagliflozin doses decreased body weight and total daily insulin dose at 
24 weeks compared with placebo; these reductions were maintained up to 52 weeks. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in both dapagliflozin groups (one and two cases, 
respectively) but not with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and safety results from the Japanese subpopulation of the 
DEPICT-2 study were generally consistent with those from the overall population, 
indicating that long-term dapagliflozin adjunct to insulin therapy improves 
glycaemic control without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia but with a risk of 
diabetic ketoacidosis in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes.

AIM: To determine what proportion of the inter-country variation in death rates 
can be explained in terms of obesity rates and other known risk factors for 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 death rates from 30 industrialized countries 
were analysed using linear regression models. Covariates modelled population 
density, the age structure of the population, obesity, population health, per 
capita gross domestic product (GDP), ethnic diversity, national temperature and 
the delay in the government imposing virus control measures.
RESULTS: The multivariable regression model explained 63% of the inter-country 
variation in COVID-19 death rates. The initial model was optimized using 
stepwise selection. In descending order of absolute size of model coefficient, 
the covariates in the optimized model were the obesity rate, the hypertension 
rate, population density, life expectancy, the percentage of the population aged 
older than 65 years, the percentage of the population aged younger than 
15 years, the diabetes rate, the delay in imposing national COVID-19 control 
measures, per capita GDP and mean temperature (with a negative coefficient 
indicating an association between higher national temperatures and lower death 
rates).
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the inter-country variation in COVID-19 death 
rates can be explained by differences in obesity rates, population health, 
population densities, age demographics, delays in imposing national virus 
control measures, per capita GDP and climate. Some of the unexplained variation 
is probably attributable to inter-country differences in the definition of a 
COVID-19 death and in the completeness of the recording of COVID-19 deaths.

The suboccipital muscles are a group of four muscles located in the posterior 
region of the neck, inferior to the occipital bone. These four muscles are the 
rectus capitis posterior major, rectus capitis posterior minor, obliquus capitis 
superior, and obliquus capitis inferior. The muscles serve as postural support 
of the head and neck and allow extension and rotation movements of the neck. The 
muscles are innervated by the suboccipital nerve, which is formed by the dorsal 
ramus of C1. Three of the four muscles form the suboccipital triangle, a common 
anatomic landmark that localizes the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve. 
This landmark is particularly important to surgeons operating in the posterior 
cervical region to avoid life-threatening bleeding. The vertebral artery takes a 
torturous course behind the suboccipital muscles while giving off branches that 
supply the suboccipital muscles. Clinically, the suboccipital muscles have 
importance regarding their close relationship to the vertebral artery and 
surgical access to the posterior cranial fossa. Various cranial pathologies can 
be accessed by a suboccipital surgical approach that requires knowledge of the 
posterior cervical region. The group of four muscles has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of cervicogenic headaches due to their connections with the dura 
mater.

Heart failure is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, 
and it is associated with poor life expectancy, poor quality of life, and a 
higher economic burden on the healthcare system. Heart failure can result from 
several causes, but left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the major cause of 
heart failure. Over the past three decades, advances in the medical management 
of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have improved the 
survival of the patients, but the morbidity and mortality related to heart 
failure remained elevated.  With an increase in the age of the population and 
advances in the treatment of ischemic heart diseases, the number of patients 
with heart failure continues to grow, which has introduced significant 
challenges to managing cardiac arrhythmia and advanced heart failure. In 
patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, electromechanical 
dyssynchrony from intraventricular conduction delays leads to hemodynamic 
inefficiencies, which consequently worsen functional mitral regurgitation and 
left ventricular remodeling, eventually leading to poor outcomes. In the early 
1990s, it was identified that electromechanical dyssynchrony plays a prominent 
role in heart failure, and pacing devices that stimulate several places in the 
heart at once could be utilized to offset this dyssynchrony and conduction 
delay. In the late 1990s, Auricchio and Kass first described the efficacy of 
multisite pacing in humans, which led to cardiac resynchronization therapy 
(CRT), the first use of artificial electrical stimulation for heart failure. 
Since then, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been an important 
treatment modality for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. In 
this review, we will discuss the use of implantable pacing devices in heart 
failure with a primary focus on biventricular pacing (cardiac 
resynchronization), and we will discuss the pathophysiology, indications, 
complications, and clinical significance.

Examination of incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years and risk 
factors of breast cancer in 49 Asian countries, 1990-2019: estimates from Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019.

BACKGROUND: This study presents an up-to-date, comprehensive and comparative 
examination of breast cancer's temporal patterns in females in Asia in last 
three decades.
METHODS: The estimates of incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted-life-years 
and risk factors of breast cancer in females in 49 Asian countries were 
retrieved from Global Burden of Disease 2019 study.
RESULTS: In Asia, female breast cancer incidence grew from 245 045[226 259-265 
260] in 1990 to 914 878[815 789-1025 502] in 2019 with age-standardized 
incidence rate rising from 21.2/100 000[19.6-22.9] to 35.9/100 000[32.0-40.2] 
between 1990 and 2019. The death counts more than doubled from 136 665[126 
094-148 380] to 337 822[301 454-375 251]. The age-standardized mortality rate 
rose marginally between 1990 and 2019 (1990: 12.1[11.0-13.1]; 2019: 
13.4[12.0-14.9]). In 2019, age-standardized incidence rate varied from 17.2/100 
000[13.95-21.4] in Mongolia to 122.5[92.1-160.7] in Lebanon and the 
age-standardized mortality rate varied 4-fold from 8.0/100 000 [7.2-8.8] in 
South Korea to 51.9[39.0-69.8] in Pakistan. High body mass index (5.6%), high 
fasting plasma glucose (5.6%) and secondhand smoke (3.5%) were the main 
contributory risk factors to all-age disability-adjusted-life-years due to 
breast cancer in Asia.
CONCLUSION: With growing incidence, escalating dietary and behavioural risk 
factors and lower survival rates due to late-disease presentation in low- and 
medium-income countries of Asia, breast cancer has become a significant public 
health threat. Its rising burden calls for increasing breast cancer awareness, 
preventive measures, early-stage detection and cost-effective therapeutics in 
Asia.

Aging is a biological process caused by the accumulation of senescent cells with 
a permanent proliferative arrest. To the influence of aging on human life 
expectancy, there is essential for new biomarkers which possibly will assistance 
in recognizing age-associated pathologies. Exosomes, which are cell-secreted 
nanovesicles, make available a new biomarker detection and therapeutic approach 
for the transfer of different molecules with high capacity. Recently, non-coding 
RNAs (ncRNA) which are contained in exosomes have developed as important 
molecules regulating the complexity of aging and relevant human diseases. The 
discovery of ncRNA provided perceptions into an innovative regulatory platform 
that could interfere with cellular senescence. The non-coding transcriptome 
includes a different of RNA species, spanning from short ncRNAs (<200 
nucleotides) to long ncRNAs, that are >200 bp long. Upgraded evidence displays 
that targeting ncRNAs possibly will influence senescence pathways. In this 
article, we will address ncRNAs that participated in age-related and cellular 
senescence diseases. Growing conception of ncRNAs in the aging process possibly 
will be responsible for new understandings into the improvement of age-related 
diseases and elongated life span.

CONTEXT: Generativity is a process whereby patients nearing the end of life 
invest in those they will soon leave behind. In recent years, the trajectory of 
cancer has changed, as new therapies have prolonged survival and patients often 
live with metastatic disease for several years. For these patients and for the 
healthcare professionals who care for them it can be useful to understand if the 
concept of generativity is clinically salient.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the meanings emerging from two dignity therapy questions, 
particularly salient to generativity, amongst cancer patients in different care 
settings.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, qualitative study in 1) home 
palliative care (life expectancy < 3 months); 2) specialized palliative care 
provided by team within an oncology hospital (life expectancy > 9-12 months); 
and 3) oncological day hospital (potentially curable disease). We thematically 
analyzed the answers of two dignity therapy questions.
RESULTS: Three themes and related meanings emerged from 37 dignity therapy 
sessions with respect to the two questions: 1) Meanings concerning the present 
life and illness, including the experience of suffering; 2) Thoughts and actions 
towards the self, including ways in which the patients have felt alive; 3) 
Thoughts and actions towards significant others, especially values that are 
based mainly on love for oneself and for others. No notable differences across 
stages and care settings emerged in terms of the meanings emerging from two 
dignity therapy questions.
CONCLUSION: Conversations about generativity could inform clinicians on how to 
communicate about existential and meaning-based issues across different stages 
of illness.

Since the last century, advances in healthcare, housing, and education have led 
to an increase in life expectancy. Longevity is accompanied by a higher 
prevalence of age-related diseases, such as cancer, autoimmunity, diabetes, and 
infection, and part of this increase in disease incidence relates to the 
significant changes that aging brings about in the immune system. The eye is not 
spared by aging either, presenting with age-related disorders of its own, and 
interestingly, many of these diseases have immune pathophysiology. Being 
delicate organs that must be exposed to the environment in order to capture 
light, the eyes are endowed with a mucosal environment that protects them, the 
so-called ocular surface. As in other mucosal sites, immune responses at the 
ocular surface need to be swift and potent to eliminate threats but are at the 
same time tightly controlled to prevent excessive inflammation and bystander 
damage. This review will detail how aging affects the mucosal immune response of 
the ocular surface as a whole and how this process relates to the higher 
incidence of ocular surface disease in the elderly.

The design and construction of de novo enzymes offer potentially facile routes 
to exploiting powerful chemistries in robust, expressible and customisable 
protein frameworks, while providing insight into natural enzyme function. To 
this end, we have recently demonstrated extensive catalytic promiscuity in a 
heme-containing de novo protein, C45. The diverse transformations that C45 
catalyses include substrate oxidation, dehalogenation and carbon‑carbon bond 
formation. Here we explore the substrate promiscuity of C45's peroxidase 
activity, screening the de novo enzyme against a panel of peroxidase and 
dehaloperoxidase substrates. Consistent with the function of natural 
peroxidases, C45 exhibits a broad spectrum of substrate activities with 
selectivity dictated primarily by the redox potential of the substrate, and by 
extension, the active oxidising species in peroxidase chemistry, compounds I and 
II. Though the comparison of these redox potentials provides a threshold for 
determining activity for a given substrate, substrate:protein interactions are 
also likely to play a significant role in determining electron transfer rates 
from substrate to heme, affecting the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. We also 
used biomolecular simulation to screen substrates against a computational model 
of C45 to identify potential interactions and binding sites. Several sites of 
interest in close proximity to the heme cofactor were discovered, providing 
insight into the catalytic workings of C45.

PROBLEM: Health diaries with both clinical and narrative elements have been 
widely used in pediatrics to study children's and families' experiences of 
illness and coping strategies. The objective of this study is to obtain a 
synthesis of the literature about narrative health diaries using the PRISMA 
extension for scoping reviews.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Sources were limited to: English language; narrative 
diaries; children/adolescents and/or parents/caregivers.
SAMPLE: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase and CINAHL with no 
time limits.
RESULTS: Among 36 articles included the most common context where a diary was 
implemented was the home (61%), the hospital (17%) and the school (14%). The 
most common diarist is the child or adolescent (50%). Paper diary was the most 
common type (53%), followed by the video diary (19%), the e-diary (8%) or the 
audio diary (8%). None of the studies explored the impact of the use of diaries 
on patient outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The narrative health diary is used to report patient experiences of 
illness or common life from the point of view of the child, adolescent or other 
family members. The diversity of the diaries found shows how the narrative diary 
may be 'adapted' to different settings and pediatric populations.
IMPLICATIONS: The narrative diary is a relevant tool for the exploration of 
children's and adolescents' experiences of illness and common life. Studies are 
still needed to describe the impact of narrative diaries keeping on children's 
health outcomes.

Medicine (McBrien), Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, 
Alta.

BACKGROUND: Many refugees and asylum seekers from countries where 
schistosomiasis is endemic are infected with the Schistosoma parasite when they 
arrive in Canada. We assessed, from a systemic perspective, which of the 
following management strategies by health care providers is cost-effective: 
testing for schistosomiasis and treating if the individual is infected, treating 
presumptively or waiting for symptoms to emerge.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-tree model to examine the cost-effectiveness 
of 3 management strategies: watchful waiting, screening and treatment, and 
presumptive treatment. We obtained data for the model from the literature and 
other sources, to predict deaths and chronic complications caused by 
schistosomiasis, as well as costs and net monetary benefit.
RESULTS: Presumptive treatment was cost-saving if the prevalence of 
schistosomiasis in the target population was greater than 2.1%. In our baseline 
analysis, presumptive treatment was associated with an increase of 0.156 
quality-adjusted life years and a cost saving of $405 per person, compared with 
watchful waiting. It was also more effective and less costly than screening and 
treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Among recently resettled refugees and asylum claimants in 
Canada, from countries where schistosomiasis is endemic, presumptive treatment 
was predicted to be less costly and more effective than watchful waiting or 
screening and treatment. Our results support a revision of the current Canadian 
recommendations.

INTRODUCTION: Early use of insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) is recommended for 
patients with unexplained syncope following initial clinical workup, due to its 
superior ability to establish symptom-rhythm correlation compared with 
conventional testing (CONV). However, ICMs incur higher upfront costs, and the 
impact of additional diagnoses and resulting treatment on downstream costs and 
outcomes is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICM compared 
with CONV for the diagnosis of arrhythmia in patients with unexplained syncope, 
from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and benefits of 
arrhythmia diagnosis with ICM versus CONV, considering all related diagnostic 
and arrhythmia-related treatment costs and consequences. Cohort characteristics 
and costs were informed by original claims database analyses. Risks of 
mortality, syncopal recurrence, injury due to syncope and quality of life 
consequences from syncopal events were identified from the literature.
RESULTS: ICM was less costly and more effective than CONV. Most of the observed 
US$4532 cost savings were attributed to reduced downstream diagnostic testing. 
For every 1000 patients, ICM was projected to yield an additional 253 arrhythmia 
diagnoses and lead to treatment in an additional 168 patients. The ICM strategy 
resulted in overall improved outcomes (0.30 quality-adjusted life years gained), 
due to a reduction in syncope recurrence and injury resulting from arrhythmia 
treatment. The results were robust to changes in the base case parameters but 
sensitive to the model time horizon, underlying probability of syncope 
recurrence and prevalence of arrhythmias.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model projected that early ICM for the diagnosis of unexplained 
syncope reduced long-term costs, and led to an improvement in overall clinical 
outcomes by shortening time to arrhythmia treatment. The cost of ICM was 
outweighed by savings arising from fewer downstream diagnostic episodes, and the 
increased cost of treatment was counterbalanced by fewer syncope-related event 
costs.

The improvement of life quality and medical advances has resulted in increased 
life expectancy. Despite this, health status commonly worsens in the last years 
of life. Frailty is an intermediate and reversible state that often precedes 
dependency and therefore, its identification may be essential to prevent 
dependency. However, there is no consensus on the best tools to identify 
frailty. In this sense, diverse molecules have been proposed as potential 
biomarkers. Some investigations pointed to an increased chronic inflammation or 
inflammaging with frailty, while others did not report such differences. In this 
work, we evaluated the circulating concentration of the inflammaging markers in 
adults and older adults (aged over 70 years) by ELISA and Luminex techniques. 
The Barthel Index was applied for the evaluation of dependency and Timed 
up-and-go, Gait Speed, Short Physical Performance Battery, Tilburg Frailty 
Indicator and Gerontopole Frailty Screening Tool were used for the 
identification of frailty. CRP, TNF-α, IL-6 and albumin concentrations were 
measured, and we found that elevated inflammation is present in older adults, 
while no differences with frailty and dependency were reported. Our results were 
consistent for all the evaluated frailty scales, highlighting the need to 
reconsider increased inflammation as a biomarker of frailty.

BACKGROUND: In terminal cancer patients (TCPs), one of the most important things 
is to define the survival to help the main responsible physicians, patients, and 
main caregivers make decisions, set goals, and work across the end-of-life 
strategies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical files of TCPs, who 
died during September 2011 and December 2017, to recognize the correlation 
between prognostic nutritional indices (PNIs) and survival in those subtypes of 
patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify 
the cutoff value of PNI.
RESULTS: A total of 858 TCPs were eligible and included, the median age was 62 
years (range: 18-107). The most common primary cancer sites were colorectal 
cancer in 151 patients (17.6%), hepatobiliary in 129 (15%), lung cancer in 115 
(13.4%), breast cancer in 114 (13.3%), and genitourinary in 80 (9.3%). The mean 
value of PNI for all cancer types was 32.9 ± 6.7. The values showed different 
levels across cancer types. For patients who lived >2 weeks, PNI was 36.7 
compared with that who died within 2 weeks was 29.3, which was a statistically 
significant (P < 0.001). By the ROC curve, the cutoff value of PNI was 32.3 and 
area under the curve was 0.888. The sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value, and negative predictive value were 91.28% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 88.2-93.8), 71.09% (95% CI: 66.5-75.4), 76.5% (95% CI: 
73.7-79.2), and 88.8% (95% CI: 85.3-91.5), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The PNI is an easy and an applicable biomarker to estimate life 
expectancy in TCPs.

Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is an increasingly common complication 
seen in the palliative care setting due to increased life expectancy of breast 
cancer survivors. It is an important determinant of the quality of life of 
breast cancer survivors, due to the functional impact that it has, apart from 
the pain and deformity associated with it. Conservative management of lymphedema 
with the help of physiotherapy, positioning, manual lymphatic drainage, and 
intermittent pneumatic compression is well known. Even then, there remains a 
subset of patients that fail to respond to conservative management. T2 
sympathectomy is a technique which ablates the thoracic sympathetic chain and 
helps in improving the lymphatic drainage. We report a series of four cases of 
BCRL, which showed a significant reduction in the mid-arm circumference as well 
as pain scores after a T2 sympathectomy. We believe that T2 sympathectomy can be 
used as the second line of management in lymphedema patients in whom 
conservative treatment has failed.

Active Ageing across the Life Course: Towards a Comprehensive Approach to 
Prevention.

Building, Northumberland Road, Sheffield S10 2TU, UK.

"Active ageing" has become the leading scientific and policy conceptualization 
of a later life over the past two decades in the European Union (EU). It has 
been used as a key strategy for responding to demographic ageing. In the United 
States, in contrast, discourses around successful ageing have been more 
prevalent. This review article charts the development of active ageing responses 
to demographic change, showing how the concept compares with the notion of 
successful ageing and other terms associated with "ageing well." It identifies 
how, in practice, active ageing has been dominated by a narrow economic or 
productivist interpretation that prioritizes the extension of working life (to 
reduce the "burden" of population ageing). Such interpretations of active ageing 
undermine its value and emphasize the need for a more comprehensive approach 
which is set out. The development of the Active Ageing Index in 2012 provided a 
new analytical tool to promote evidence-based strategies towards population 
ageing. However, in practice, we show how it has not yet engaged fully with a 
comprehensive approach to active ageing or with the critical role of the life 
course in shaping the experience of old age. Nonetheless, this review article 
shows that the concept of active ageing still has an important role to play in 
our understanding of and responses to population ageing.

AIMS: To determine the impact of preventing new (incident) cases of coronary 
heart disease (CHD) on years of life and productivity, using the novel measure 
'productivity-adjusted life year' (PALY), over the next 10 years.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A dynamic life table model was constructed for the total 
Australian working-age population (15-69 years) over 10 years (2020-2029), 
separated by CHD status. Productivity estimates were sourced from the 
literature. The PALY was ascribed a financial value in terms of gross domestic 
product (GDP) per equivalent full-time worker. The total number of years lived, 
PALYs, and economic burden (in terms of GDP per PALY) were estimated. The model 
simulation was repeated assuming incidence was reduced, and the differences 
represented the impact of CHD prevention. All outcomes were discounted by 5% per 
annum. Over 10 years, the total projected years lived and PALYs in the 
Australian working-age population (with and without CHD) were 133 million and 83 
million, respectively, amounting to A$17.2 trillion in GDP. We predicted more 
than 290 000 new (incident) CHD cases over the next 10 years. If all new cases 
of CHD could be prevented during this period, a total of 4 000 deaths could be 
averted, resulting in more than 8 000 years of life saved and 104 000 PALYs 
gained, equivalent to a gain of nearly A$21.8 billion (US$14.8 billion) in GDP.
CONCLUSION: Prevention of CHD will prolong years of life lived and productive 
life years, resulting in substantial economic benefit. Policy makers and 
employers are encouraged to engage in preventive measures addressing CHD.

BACKGROUND: Planning for end of life (EOL) care has become an important 
consideration for doctors and patients in the context of longer life expectancy 
in most high-income countries. Advance care plans (ACPs) allow individuals to 
make plans for future healthcare practices for when they no longer have the 
capacity to make such decisions. It has been suggested that general 
practitioners (GPs) have the ideal relationship with patients to facilitate this 
process. However, the uptake of ACPs still remains low, prompting the need to 
understand the views of GPs regarding ACPs.
AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes of GPs 
regarding ACPs and to identify barriers in implementing ACPs into practice.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with GPs 
in county Cork and Kerry.
METHODS: A questionnaire was adapted from two previously published studies, 
piloted and posted to GPs. Two hundred thirty-seven questionnaires were posted.
RESULTS: Seventy-five questionnaires were completed, representing a 31.7% 
response rate. Findings revealed that GPs have positive attitudes towards ACPS, 
although there is an inadequate understanding of ACPs. In particular, GPs are 
challenged by defining the right moment to initiate EOL discussions, their 
patients' unawareness of ACPs, and lack of time during consultations.
CONCLUSION: In order to improve their implementation, workshops and courses 
should be developed to increase GPs' knowledge and confidence. Additionally, the 
healthcare system should be adapted, supporting GPs to facilitate these 
important discussions to take place.

As human life expectancy increases, there is an increased prevalence of 
neurodegenerative disorders and dementia. There are many ongoing research trials 
for early diagnosis and management of dementia, and neuroimaging is a critical 
part of such studies. However, conventional neuroimaging often fails to provide 
enough diagnostic findings in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. In this 
context, different MRI sequences are currently under investigation to facilitate 
the accurate diagnosis of such disorders. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) 
is an innovative MRI technique that utilizes "magnitude" and "phase" images to 
produce an image contrast that is sensitive for the detection of susceptibility 
differences of the tissues. As many neurodegenerative disorders are associated 
with accelerated iron deposition and/or microhemorrhages in different parts of 
the brain, SWI can be applied to detect these diagnostic clues. For instance, in 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy, SWI can demonstrate cortical microhemorrhages, 
which are predominantly in the frontal and parietal regions. Or in Parkinson 
disease, abnormal swallow-tail sign on high-resolution SWI is highly diagnostic. 
Also, SWI is a useful sequence to detect the low signal intensity of precentral 
cortices in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Being familiar with SWI 
findings in neurodegenerative disorders is critical for an accurate diagnosis. 
In this paper, the authors review the technical parameters of SWI, physiologic, 
and pathologic iron deposition in the brain, and the role of SWI in the 
evaluation of neurodegenerative disorders in daily practice.

The landscape of HIV medicine dramatically changed with the advent of 
contemporary antiretroviral therapies, which has allowed persons with HIV (PWH) 
to achieve good virologic control, essentially eliminating HIV-related 
complications and increasing life expectancy. As PWH are living longer, 
noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), have become a 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in PWH with rates that are 50% to 100% 
higher than in well-matched persons without HIV. In this review, we focus on 
disease of the coronary microvasculature and myocardium in HIV. We highlight a 
key hormonal system important to cardiovascular endocrinology, the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), as a potential mediator of 
inflammatory driven-vascular and myocardial injury and consider RAAS blockade as 
a physiologically targeted strategy to reduce CVD in HIV.

BACKGROUND: The rise in pediatric obesity and its accompanying condition, type 2 
diabetes (T2D), is a serious public health concern. T2D in adolescents is 
associated with poor health outcomes and decreased life expectancy. Effective 
diabetes prevention strategies for high-risk adolescents and their families are 
urgently needed.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to co-design a diabetes prevention program 
for adolescents by using human-centered design methodologies.
METHODS: We partnered with at-risk adolescents, parents, and professionals with 
expertise in diabetes prevention or those working with adolescents to conduct a 
series of human-centered design research sessions to co-design a diabetes 
prevention intervention for youth and their families. In order to do so, we
