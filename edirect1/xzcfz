BACKGROUND: This study identifies the overall survival status of lung cancer 
patients with bone metastasis and metastasis patterns. Poor prognostic factors 
were identified to develop a scoring system for estimating survival period after 
bone metastasis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed at Chiang Mai University 
for the period January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2013. Time-to-event analysis was 
performed to estimate survival rate. The primary end point was death related to 
lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the prognostic variables 
was done using the Cox's regression model. The score was derived from the 
corresponding estimated regression coefficients of significantly poor prognostic 
factors.
RESULTS: A total of 505 lung cancer with bone metastasis patients were analyzed. 
Four hundred two cases (79.6%) were concurrent diagnosis and 103 (20.4%) were 
subsequent diagnosis. The median survival time of lung cancer after bone 
metastasis 148 days. Male gender and ECOG 3-4 were significant poor prognostic 
factors for lung cancer after bone metastasis, with hazard ratios of 1.42 (95% 
CI 1.17-1.73), and 1.30 (95% CI 1.06-1.60), respectively. Prognosis score was 
determined using the binary term present/not-present for those factors. The 
curve from prognostic score summations of 2, 1 and 0 presented a good 
discrimination of survival expectancy, showing an expected median survival time 
of approximately 109, 146, and 225 days, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic score is a clinically simple and easy method for 
estimating life expectancy and for guiding interventions in bone metastasis of 
lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer, often striking in 
the prime of life. This study provides new information directly from advanced 
melanoma (stage III and IV) patients on how their disease impacts their 
health-related quality of life (HRQL).
METHODS: Twenty-nine in-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with adult 
patients with advanced melanoma in Canada. A semi-structured interview guide was 
used. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and key concepts were identified 
using a grounded theory analytic approach.
RESULTS: Many patients' journeys began with the startling diagnosis of an 
invasive disease and a vastly shortened life expectancy. By the time they 
reached an advanced stage of melanoma, these patients' overall functioning and 
quality of life had been greatly diminished by this quickly progressing cancer. 
The impact was described in terms of physical pain and disability, emotional 
distress, diminished interactions with friends and family, and burden on 
caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of signs, symptoms, and functional 
impacts of advanced melanoma. Signs and symptoms reported (physical, mental, and 
social) confirm and expand on those reported in the existing clinical 
literature. Primary care physicians should be better trained to identify 
melanomas early. Oncology care teams can improve on their current approaches for 
helping patients navigate treatment options, with information about ancillary 
services to mitigate disease impacts on HRQL, such as mental health and social 
supports, as well as employment or financial support services.

Personality Pathology in Primary Care: Ongoing Needs for Detection and 
Intervention.

Recent studies demonstrate that personality disorders are prevalent within 
outpatient psychiatry clinics, though they also are quite common in primary care 
settings. Studies across multiple health care settings demonstrate that those 
with a known PD have higher incidences of health problems, higher utilization of 
the health care system, and have a life expectancy 17.7 years less than that of 
the population in general. Despite these data, little attention has been 
directed toward detecting, managing, and treating patients with personality 
pathology in primary care settings. Consequently, it is argued that more 
attention be devoted to detecting PDs in this population, training physicians 
and primary care professionals in the rapid screening of personality pathology, 
the management of patients with personality pathology, and utilizing behavioral 
health specialists and reliable referral sources to address these problems as 
part of their overall health care management. Suggestions for how to implement 
these ideas are offered.

Posterior spinal fusion implants include number of interconnecting components, 
which are subjected to micromotion under physiological loading conditions 
inducing a potential for fretting corrosion. There is very little known about 
the fretting corrosion in these devices in terms of the minimum angular 
displacement (threshold) necessary to induce fretting corrosion or the amount of 
fretting corrosion that can arise during the life of the implant. Therefore, the 
first goal was to evaluate the threshold fretting corrosion in three anatomical 
orientations and second the long-term fretting corrosion for the three different 
material types of spinal implants under physiological loading conditions. In 
threshold test, axial rotation exhibited highest changes in open circuit 
potential (VOCP in mV) and induced fretting currents (Ifrett in µA) for cobalt 
chrome (ΔVOCP : 24.71 ± 5.53; ΔIfrett : 4.03 ± 0.51) and stainless steel (ΔVOCP 
: 28.21 ± 6.97; ΔIfrett : 2.98 ± 0.42) constructs whereas it was 
flexion-extension for titanium constructs (ΔVOCP : 4.51 ± 2.48; ΔIfrett : 
0.38 ± 0.12). Long-term test indicated that the titanium (VOCP :101 ± 0.06; 
Ifrett : 0.07 ± 0.02) and cobalt chrome (VOCP : 140.67 ± 0.04; Ifrett : 
0.12 ± 0.05) constructs were more resistant to the fretting corrosion compared 
to stainless steel (VOCP : -135.33 ± 0.31; Ifrett : 2.63 ± 1.06). © 2018 Wiley

The paper is the second part of the series of two articles on demographic 
aspects of population aging in Saint-Petersburg in 1990-2010/2014 compared to 
the situation in the Russian Federation as a whole. In the first part, the 
situation with population aging in Saint-Petersburg and Russia was considered 
based on traditional aging measures. In the second part, a number of prospective 
aging measures that take account of remaining life expectancy are studied, such 
as Prop. RLE 15 (proportion of population with remaining life expectancy 15 
years or less), POADR (prospective old-age dependency ratio), population average 
remaining years of life (PARIL). Prospective aging indicators are compared with 
their traditional analogues. Gender imbalance of prospective aging measures has 
been considered.

демографическим аспектам старения населения Санкт-Петербурга в 1990–2014 гг. в 
сопоставлении с ситуацией в России в целом. В 1 й части был представлен анализ 
процесса демографического старения в Санкт-Петербурге и России на основе 
традиционных мер старения населения — доли пожилых в общей численности 
населения, индекса старения, коэффициента демографической нагрузки за счет 
пожилых и коэффициента поддержки родителей [6]. Во 2 й части рассмотрен ряд 
«перспективных» показателей старения населения (prospective measures), 
основанных не на хронологическом возрасте, а на продолжительности предстоящей 
жизни (доля лиц с ожидаемой продолжительностью жизни (ОПЖ) 15 лет и менее в 
общей численности населения; перспективная демографической нагрузка за счет 
пожилых; среднее число предстоящих лет жизни населения). Проанализированы 
гендерные различия показателей старения населения. Ускорение темпов старения 
населения Санкт-Петербурга и России ведет к новой демографической ситуации, 
которая требует принятия соответствующих мер экономической и социальной 
направленности.

Cell cultures used in biomedical experiments come in the form of both sample 
biopsy primary cells, and maintainable immortalised cell lineages. The rise of 
bioinformatics and high-throughput technologies has led us to the requirement of 
ontology representation of cell types and cell lines. The Cell Ontology (CL) and 
Cell Line Ontology (CLO) have long been established as reference ontologies in 
the OBO framework. We have compiled a series of the challenges and the proposals 
of solutions in this CELLS (Cells in ExperimentaL Life Sciences) thematic series 
that cover the grounds of standing issues and the directions, which were 
discussed in the First International Workshop on CELLS at the the International 
Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO). This workshop focused on the extension 
of the current CL and CLO to cover a wider set of biological questions and 
challenges needing semantic infrastructure for information modeling. We 
discussed data-driven use cases that leverage linkage of CL, CLO and other 
bio-ontologies. This is an established approach in data-driven ontologies such 
as the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), and the Ontology for Biomedical 
Investigation (OBI). The First International Workshop on CELLS at the 
International Conference on Biomedical Ontology has brought together 
experimental biologists and biomedical ontologists to discuss solutions to 
organizing and representing the rapidly evolving knowledge gained from 
experimental cells. The workshop has successfully identified the areas of 
challenge, and the gap in connecting the two domains of knowledge. The outcome 
of this workshop yielded practical implementation plans to filled in this 
gap.This CELLS workshop also provided a venue for panel discussions of 
innovative solutions as well as challenges in the development and applications 
of biomedical ontologies to represent and analyze experimental cell data.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury limits severely life expectancy and it causes 
in a restriction in the activities of the daily life of the subjects who suffer 
it. Training the gait with portable exoskeletons in subjects with spinal cord 
injury is a new approach to rehabilitation.
AIM: To examine the usability and acceptability of these devices for gait 
training in subjects with spinal cord injury.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted until February 2017 in 
the databases: Medline (PubMed, EBSCO), PEDro, Scopus and Web of Science. The 
methodological quality, the level of scientific evidence and the strength of 
recommendation were evaluated.
RESULTS: Finally, eight studies were considered recruiting a total of 45 
patients. The training programs had an average of 35 sessions and a duration 60 
minutes approximately. In general, no adverse events and no relevant increases 
in pain, blood pressure, heart rate or fatigue were reported. In addition, the 
satisfaction with the intervention and the perception of quality of life of the 
participants were quite high.
CONCLUSIONS: The rehabilitation of the gait with portable exoskeletons seems to 
be a safe intervention that generates acceptance and satisfaction among patients 
with spinal cord injury.

On the influence of lipid-induced optical anisotropy for the bioimaging of exo- 
or endocytosis with interference microscopic imaging.

Some implementations of interference microscopy imaging use digital holographic 
measurements of complex scattered fields to reconstruct three-dimensional 
refractive index maps of weakly scattering, semi-transparent objects, frequently 
encountered in biological investigations. Reconstruction occurs through 
application of the object scattering potential which assumes an isotropic 
refractive index throughout the object. Here, we demonstrate that this 
assumption can in some circumstances be invalid for biological imaging due to 
the presence of lipid-induced optical anisotropy. We show that the nanoscale 
organization of lipids in the observation of cellular endocytosis with polarized 
light induces a significant change in far-field scattering. We obtain this 
result by presenting a general solution to Maxwell's equations describing light 
scattering of core-shell particles near an isotropic substrate covered with an 
anisotropic thin film. This solution is based on an extension of the 
Bobbert-Vlieger solution for particle scattering near a substrate delivering an 
exact solution to the scattering problem in the near field as well as far field. 
By applying this solution to study light scattering by a lipid vesicle near a 
lipid bilayer, whereby the lipids are represented through a biaxial optical 
model, we conclude through ellipsometry concepts that effective amounts of 
lipid-induced optical anisotropy significantly alter far-field optical 
scattering in respect to an equivalent optical model that neglects the presence 
of optical anisotropy.

This study was based on two medical wards in a teaching hospital. It examined 
the accuracy with which nurses estimated patients' prognoses in the last days 
and hours of life and the cues used to make such assessments. An exploratory and 
descriptive approach was adopted. The study was divided into two parts: a 
cross-sectional interview study and a prospective patient follow-up study. The 
cues used by the nurses were identified and categorised and estimates of life 
expectancy were assessed for accuracy. Results showed that multiple cues were 
used and that although nurses were able to identify patients who were dying 
imminently, their accuracy regarding precise prognosis varied considerably. They 
also revealed that the most accurate assessments were made by nurses carrying 
out basic patient care, rather than the most experienced staff.

PURPOSE: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
cancer risk management interventions for BRCA carriers.
METHODS: Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses were 
identified by searching scientific and health economic databases. Eligible 
studies modeled the impact of a cancer risk management intervention in BRCA 
carriers on life expectancy (LE), cancer incidence, or quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), with or without costs.
RESULTS: Twenty-six economic evaluations and eight comparative effectiveness 
analyses were included. Combined risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and 
prophylactic mastectomy resulted in the greatest LE and was cost-effective in 
most analyses. Despite leading to increased LE and QALYs, combined mammography 
and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was less likely to be cost-effective 
than either mammography or MRI alone, particularly for women over 50 and BRCA2 
carriers. Variation in patient compliance to risk management interventions was 
incorporated in 11/34 studies with the remaining analyses assuming 100% 
adherence.
CONCLUSION: Prophylactic surgery and intensive breast screening are effective 
and cost-effective in models of BRCA carrier risk management. Findings were 
based predominantly on assuming perfect adherence to recommendations without 
assessment of the health-care resource use and costs related to engaging 
patients and maximizing compliance, meaning the real-world impact on clinical 
outcomes and resource use remains unclear.

HIV-1 increases extracellular amyloid-beta levels through neprilysin regulation 
in primary cultures of human astrocytes.

Since the success of combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1-infected individuals 
are now living much longer. This increased life expectancy is accompanied by a 
higher prevalence of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders. Rising too is 
the incidence in these patients of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease 
such as increased deposition of amyloid beta protein (Aβ). Although neurons are 
major sources of Aβ in the brain, astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells, 
therefore, even a small level of astrocytic Aβ metabolism could make a 
significant contribution to brain pathology. Neprilysin (NEP) is a 
decisive/crucial regulator of Aβ levels. We evaluated the effects of HIV-1 on Aβ 
deposition and the expression and activity of NEP in primary human astrocytes. 
Specifically, no differences in intracellular amyloid deposits were found 
between infected and control cells. However, primary cultures of infected 
astrocytes showed more extracellular Aβ levels compared to controls. This was 
accompanied by reduced expression of NEP and to a significant decrease in its 
activity. These results indicate that the presence of HIV-1 in the brain could 
contribute to the increase in the total burden of cerebral Aβ.

BACKGROUND: the incidence of epistaxis has increased secondary to increased life 
expectancy and morbidities. This study sought to assess the knowledge, practice 
and opinion relating to adequacy of training of advanced nurse practitioners 
(ANPs) and staff nurses (SNs) in the emergency department.
METHODS: a national survey was distributed over an 8-week period; this included 
a 3-point scoring system based on the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence Clinical Knowledge Summaries guidance on epistaxis management to 
assess overall performance.
RESULTS: analysis included 109 ANPs and 101 SNs; 12% of ANPs achieved the 
maximum score, 40% scored 2, 25% scored 1, and 23% scored 0, while 14% of SNs 
achieved the maximum score, 24% scored 2, 29% scored 1, and 32% scored 0. 
Overall 88% of respondents advocated further training.
CONCLUSION: significant deficits in knowledge regarding epistaxis management 
were highlighted. Further training could help to empower patients in basic first 
aid measures, subsequently reducing admissions rates.

The aim of this project was to investigate how patients view the care and 
support provided by their doctors and nurses. Forty-three patients with a life 
expectancy of 1 year or less who were being looked after in their own homes were 
asked to give their views of the support given by general practitioners, 
district nurses and Macmillan nurses. Patients had predominantly positive views 
of the support received. The content of their positive statements suggested that 
psychosocial aspects of support, including communication and kindness and 
consideration shown, were valued most. Actions in the form of helpfulness, 
organization of support and being accessible were also important, while clinical 
aspects received less emphasis. Clinical aspects of care were emphasized more 
when patients expressed negative views of support. Patients' statements 
suggested that emotional support and information were provided predominantly by

BACKGROUND: Attributing causes of postoperative mortality is challenging, as 
death may be multifactorial. A better understanding of complications that occur 
in patients who die is important, as it allows clinicians to focus on the most 
impactful complications. We sought to determine the postoperative complications 
with the strongest independent association with 30-day mortality.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2012-2013 National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program Participant Use Data Files. All inpatient or admit day of 
surgery cases were eligible for inclusion in this study. A multivariable least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis was used to adjust 
for patient pre- and intraoperative risk factors for mortality. Attributable 
mortality was calculated using the population attributable fraction method: the 
ratio between the odds ratio for mortality and a given complication in the 
population. Patients were separated into 10 age groups to facilitate analysis of 
age-related differences in mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1,195,825 patients were analyzed, and 9255 deceased within 
30 days (0.77%). A complication independently associated with attributable 
mortality was found in 1887 cases (20%). The most common causes of attributable 
mortality (attributable deaths per million patients) were bleeding (n = 368), 
respiratory failure (n = 358), septic shock (n = 170), and renal failure (n = 
88). Some complications, such as urinary tract infection and pneumonia, were 
associated with attributable mortality only in older patients.
DISCUSSION: Additional resources should be focused on complications associated 
with the largest attributable mortality, such as respiratory failure and 
infections. This is particularly important for complications disproportionately 
impacting younger patients, given their longer life expectancy.

This study aimed to estimate the disease burden of methylmercury for children 
born in Germany in the year 2014. Humans are mainly exposed to methylmercury 
when they eat fish or seafood. Prenatal methylmercury exposure is associated 
with IQ loss. To quantify this disease burden, we used Monte Carlo simulation to 
estimate the incidence of mild and severe mental retardation in children born to 
mothers who consume fish based on empirical data. Subsequently, we calculated 
the disease burden with the disability-adjusted life years (DALY)-method. DALYs 
combine mortality and morbidity in one measure and quantify the gap between an 
ideal situation, where the entire population experiences the standard life 
expectancy without disease and disability, and the actual situation. Thus, one 
DALY corresponds to the loss of one year of life in good health. The 
methylmercury-induced burden of disease for the German birth cohort 2014 was an 
average of 14,186 DALY (95% CI 12,915-15,440 DALY). A large majority of the 
DALYs was attributed to morbidity as compared to mortality. Of the total disease 
burden, 98% were attributed to mild mental retardation, which only leads to 
morbidity. The remaining disease burden was a result of severe mental 
retardation with equal proportions of premature death and morbidity.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate unmet clinical need in unselected hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients to determine the risk of a wide range of 
subsequent cardiovascular disease endpoints and safety endpoints relevant for 
trial design.
METHODS: Population based cohort (CALIBER, linked primary care, hospital and 
mortality records in England, period 1997-2010), all people diagnosed with HCM 
were identified and matched by age, sex and general practice with ten randomly 
selected people without HCM. Random-effects Poisson models were used to assess 
the associations between HCM and cardiovascular diseases and bleeding.
RESULTS: Among 3,290,455 eligible people a diagnosis of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy was found in 4 per 10,000. Forty-one percent of the 1,160 
individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were women and the median age was 
57 years. The median follow-up was 4.0 years. Compared to general population 
controls, people with HCM had higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia (incidence 
rate ratio = 23.53, [95% confidence interval 12.67-43.72]), cardiac arrest or 
sudden cardiac death (6.33 [3.69-10.85]), heart failure (4.31, [3.30-5.62]), and 
atrial fibrillation (3.80 [3.04-4.75]). HCM was also associated with a higher 
incidence of myocardial infarction ([MI] 1.90 [1.27-2.84]) and coronary 
revascularisation (2.32 [1.46-3.69]).The absolute Kaplan-Meier risks at 3 years 
were 8.8% for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure, 
8.4% for the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke or myocardial infarction, 
and 1.5% for major bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified major unmet need in HCM and highlighted the 
importance of implementing improved cardiovascular prevention strategies to 
increase life-expectancy of the contemporary HCM population. They also show that 
national electronic health records provide an effective method for identifying 
outcomes and clinically relevant estimates of composite efficacy and safety 
endpoints essential for trial design in rare diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the creation and implementation of the extension program 
Advanced Practice Nursing in Pediatric Urology, developed in the outpatient 
clinic of a teaching hospital in the Federal District.
METHOD: This is an experience report regarding the implementation of an 
outpatient service aimed at children and adolescents with symptoms of bladder 
and bowel dysfunction.
RESULTS: Because it is an extension program linked to the university, it follows 
a different model of care, valuing empowerment, informed and shared decision 
making, which results in a stronger bond between patients, family and the 
Pediatric Urology nursing team. It has also become a privileged space for the 
production and use of scientific knowledge, associated with the principles of 
evidence-based practice.
CONCLUSION: This project shows a different performance of the 
nurse-specialist-professor-researcher in Pediatric Urology Nursing, and it has 
become a reference in the Federal District, mainly for undergraduate and 
graduate nursing students.

OBJECTIVES: Timely and accurate assessments of disease burden are essential for 
developing effective national health policies. We used the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2015 to examine burden due to mental and substance use disorders 
in Australia.
METHODS: For each of the 20 mental and substance use disorders included in 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, systematic reviews of epidemiological data 
were conducted, and data modelled using a Bayesian meta-regression tool to 
produce prevalence estimates by age, sex, geography and year. Prevalence for 
each disorder was then combined with a disorder-specific disability weight to 
give years lived with disability, as a measure of non-fatal burden. Fatal burden 
was measured as years of life lost due to premature mortality which were 
calculated by combining the number of deaths due to a disorder with the life 
expectancy remaining at the time of death. Disability-adjusted life years were 
calculated by summing years lived with disability and years of life lost to give 
a measure of total burden. Uncertainty was calculated around all burden 
estimates.
RESULTS: Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of non-fatal 
burden in Australia in 2015, explaining 24.3% of total years lived with 
disability, and were the second leading cause of total burden, accounting for 
14.6% of total disability-adjusted life years. There was no significant change 
in the age-standardised disability-adjusted life year rates for mental and 
substance use disorders from 1990 to 2015.
CONCLUSION: Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 found that mental and substance 
use disorders were leading contributors to disease burden in Australia. Despite 
several decades of national reform, the burden of mental and substance use 
disorders remained largely unchanged between 1990 and 2015. To reduce this 
burden, effective population-level preventions strategies are required in 
addition to effective interventions of sufficient duration and coverage.

BACKGROUND: Relative benefits of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) compared 
with everolimus-eluting stents (EES) are expected to accrue after complete 
bioresorption.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We built a decision analytic Markov model comparing BVS and 
EES for a contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention population. 
Procedure-related morbidity and outcome data from the available literature were 
used to derive model probabilities. The net benefit of BVS and EES was estimated 
in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy. Under the assumption of no risk 
for device thrombosis and target lesion revascularization with BVS beyond 3 
years, the equipoise in quality-adjusted life expectancy (12.86) between BVS and 
EES was achieved 19 years after implantation. The maximum tolerable excess risk 
of 3-year BVS thrombosis equalizing the model-predicted quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of BVS and EES at 10 years was 1.40, corresponding to an absolute 
tolerable rate of 1.45%.
CONCLUSIONS: At the currently observed relative increase in device thrombosis 
and under the extreme hypothesis of no scaffold thrombosis and target lesion 
revascularization beyond 3 years, the incremental benefit of BVS over EES 
becomes apparent only after 19 years. This simulation suggests that there is a 
small degree of benefit that clinicians and decision-makers may expect from the 
first-generation BVS at the current risk of device thrombosis. Manufacturers 
should target scaffold thrombosis rates <1.45% at 3 years to make their 
technologies attractive during a 10-year horizon.

The contribution of differences in adiposity to educational disparities in 
mortality in the United States.

Vierboom YC(1).

BACKGROUND: There are large differences in life expectancy by educational 
attainment in the United States. Previous research has found obesity's 
contribution to these differences to be small. Those findings may be sensitive 
to how obesity is estimated.
METHODS: This analysis uses discrete-time logistic regressions with data from 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), pooled from 1988 
to 1994 and 1999 to 2010, to estimate the contribution of differences in 
adiposity, or body fat, to educational differences in mortality. I show that 
results depend upon the measure of adiposity used: body mass index (BMI) at the 
time of survey or lifetime maximum BMI.
RESULTS: College graduates were less likely than high school graduates to be 
obese at the time of survey (25% vs. 34.6%, respectively) and were also less 
likely to have ever been obese (35.7% vs. 49.4%, respectively). Lifetime maximum 
BMI performed better than BMI at the time of survey in predicting mortality 
using criteria for model selection. Differences in maximum BMI were associated 
with between 10.3% and 12% of mortality differences between college graduates 
and all others, compared to between 3.3% and 4.6% for BMI at the time of survey. 
Among nonsmokers, between 18.4% and 27.6% of mortality differences between 
college graduates and all others were associated with differences in maximum 
BMI.
CONTRIBUTION: Adiposity is an overlooked contributor to educational differences 
in mortality. Previous findings that obesity does not contribute to educational 
disparities were based on BMI at the time of survey, which is less informative 
than maximum BMI. The contribution of adiposity to educational mortality 
differences will likely grow as smoking prevalence declines. Health surveys 
should collect information on weight history.

Impact of HIV/aids epidemic on human capital development in West Africa.

Osun State, Nigeria.

West Africa occupies the third position with respect to the burden of human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) globally, 
after Southern and East Africa. About 5 million adults and children are infected 
with the disease in the subregion, while HIV prevalence in the general 
population hovers around 2% and 5%. This paper attempts to investigate the 
impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic on human capital development in 11 West African 
countries over the period 1990 to 2011. The study used a dynamic panel data 
modeling approach, using first difference, difference generalized methods of 
moment, and system generalized methods of moment estimating techniques. Four 
measures of HIV/AIDS and 2 human capital measures were used in the study. The 
findings revealed that HIV/AIDS pandemic had negative and significant impact on 
human capital in West Africa. However, the statistical significance was more 
pronounced on life expectancy (a measure of human capital), while the negative 
impact on school enrolment (another human capital measure) was not significant. 
It is therefore recommended that the spread of HIV/AIDS disease in West Africa 
should be effectively controlled, while the number of infected persons 
undergoing antiretroviral therapy in the subregion should be increased to a near 
100% coverage.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in young adults undergoing mechanical or 
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) may be reduced by up to 20 years 
compared to age matched controls. The Ross procedure is a durable, 
anticoagulation-sparing alternative. We performed a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to compare the valve hemodynamics of the Ross procedure versus 
other AVR.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from 
inception to February 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
observational studies (n≥10 Ross). Independently and in duplicate, we performed 
title and abstract screening, full-text eligibility assessment, and data 
collection. We evaluated the risk of bias with the Cochrane and CLARITY tools, 
and the quality of evidence with the GRADE framework.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 2 RCTs and 13 observational studies that met 
eligibility criteria (N.=1412). In observational studies, the Ross procedure was 
associated with a lower mean aortic gradient at discharge (MD -9 mmHg, 95% CI: 
-13 to -5, P<0.0001, I2=97%) and latest follow-up (MD -5 mmHg, 95% CI: -7 to -3, 
P<0.0001, I2=92%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of 
severe aortic regurgitation at latest follow-up (RR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.3 to 5.8, 
P=0.70, I2=30%). In RCTs, the Ross procedure was associated with a lower mean 
gradient at latest follow-up (MD -15 mmHg, 95% CI: -32 to 2, P=0.08, I2=99%).
