now an imperative that the success of "smart," quality, and cost-effective high 
definition precision healthcare requires a public health perspective for several 
reasons: a) to enhance generalizability, b) to assess methods of implementation, 
and c) to focus on both risk and prevention in large and small populations, 
thereby providing a balance between the generation of long-term knowledge and 
short-term health gains. Sensitivity and resolution, reasonable cost, access to 
all Americans, coordinated comprehensive care, and advances in whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) and big data analyses, coupled to other advances in 
biotechnology and digital/artificial intelligence/machine learning devices, and 
the behavioral, social, and environmental sciences, offer remarkable 
opportunities to improve the health and wellness of the American people 
[genotype + phenotype + environment + behavior = high definition healthcare]. 
The opportunity is to significantly improve the well-being and life expectancy 
of all people across the lifespan including the least-advantaged people in our 
society and potentially increase access, reduce the national costs, and improve 
health outcomes.

Congenital arteriovenous malformations (AVM) represent a rare clinical entity. 
They are present at birth but can remain silent for many years. Due to their 
potential severity and their complex and specific management, the general 
practitioner should know when to suspect the presence of an AVM. Anatomic and 
hemodynamic characteristics of these malformations are well analysed by Doppler 
ultrasound, which is the first-line diagnostic test. MRI is often used in 
conjunction with ultrasound to better define the location and extension to 
neighbouring tissues and organs. Embolisation should be restricted to AVM 
associated with major functional disability, local complications or systemic 
cardiac complications in case of high flow volume life-threatening lesions.

Publisher: Les malformations artérioveineuses (MAV) constituent des affections 
rares présentes dès la naissance. Il est important que le médecin généraliste 
puisse évoquer ce diagnostic vu la gravité potentielle de ces lésions et leur 
prise en charge complexe. Les caractéristiques anatomiques et hémodynamiques des 
MAV sont analysables en écho-Doppler, ce qui en fait l’examen de première ligne 
dans cette situation. L’IRM complète souvent le bilan en précisant la 
localisation exacte et l’extension de la MAV aux organes ou tissus adjacents. 
L’embolisation de la lésion par l’artère afférente ou par ponction directe au 
niveau de la MAV demeure exceptionnelle et doit être réservée aux MAV associées 
à une gêne fonctionnelle majeure, ou des complications locales ou systémiques 
cardiaques avec menace vitale.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high 
personal and economic burden. Recently, new treatment options for 
castration-resistant prostate cancer became available with promising survival 
advantages. However, cost-effectiveness of those new treatment options is 
sometimes ambiguous or given only under certain circumstances. The aim of this 
study was to systematically review studies on the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments and costs of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and 
metastasizing castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) on their 
methodological quality and the risk of bias.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in the databases PubMed, 
CINAHL Complete, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection for 
costs-effectiveness analyses, model-based economic evaluations, cost-of-illness 
analyses and budget impact analyses. Reported costs were inflated to 2015 US$ 
purchasing power parities. Quality assessment and risk of bias assessment was 
performed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 
checklist and the Bias in Economic Evaluations checklist, respectively.
RESULTS: In total, 38 articles were identified by the systematic literature 
search. The methodological quality of the included studies varied widely, and 
there was considerable risk of bias. The cost-effectiveness treatments for CRPC 
and mCRPC was assessed with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from 
dominance for mitoxantrone to $562,328 per quality-adjusted life year gained for 
sipuleucel-T compared with prednisone alone. Annual costs for the treatment of 
castration-resistant prostate cancer ranged from $3,067 to $77,725.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of treatments of CRPC strongly depended on 
the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year gained/life-year saved 
throughout all included costs-effectiveness analyses and model-based economic 
evaluations. High-quality cost-effectiveness analyses based on randomized 
controlled trials are needed in order to make informed decisions on the 
management of castration-resistant prostate cancer and the resulting financial 
impact on the healthcare system.

The juxtaposition of a young city-state showing relative maturity as a rapidly 
aging society suffuses the population aging narrative in Singapore and places 
the "little red dot" on the spotlight of international aging. We first describe 
population aging in Singapore, including the characteristic events that shaped 
this demographic transition. We then detail the health care and socioeconomic 
ramifications of the rapid and significant shift to an aging society, followed 
by an overview of the main aging research areas in Singapore, including selected 
population-based data sets and the main thrust of leading aging research 
centers/institutes. After presenting established aging policies and programs, we 
also discuss current and emerging policy issues surrounding population aging in 
Singapore. We aim to contribute to the international aging literature by 
describing Singapore's position and extensive experience in managing the 
challenges and maximizing the potential of an aging population. We hope that 
similar graying populations in the region will find the material as a rich 
source of information and learning opportunities. Ultimately, we aspire to 
encourage transformative collaborations-locally, regionally, and 
internationally-and provide valuable insights for policy and practice.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global cause of mortality, which has 
prompted numerous studies seeking to reduce the risk of heart failure and sudden 
cardiac death. While regular physical activity is known to improve CVD 
associated morbidity and mortality, the optimal duration, frequency, and 
intensity of exercise remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, various 
animal models have been used to study the cardioprotective effects of exercise 
and related molecular mechanism such as the mice training models significantly 
decrease size of myocardial infarct by affecting Kir6.1, VSMC sarc-KATP 
channels, and pulmonary eNOS. Although these findings cement the importance of 
animal models in studying exercise induced cardioprotection, the vast assortment 
of exercise protocols makes comparison across studies difficult. To address this 
issue, we review and break down the existent exercise models into categories 
based on exercise modality, intensity, frequency, and duration. The timing of 
sample collection is also compared and sorted into four distinct phases: 
pre-exercise (Phase I), mid-exercise (Phase II), exercise recovery (Phase III), 
and post-exercise (Phase IV). Finally, because the life-span of animals so are 
limited, small changes in animal exercise duration can corresponded to untenable 
amounts of human exercise. To address this limitation, we introduce the 
Life-Span Relative Exercise Time (RETlife span) as a method of accurately 
defining short-term, medium-term and long-term exercise relative to the animal's 
life expectancy. Systematic organization of existent protocols and this new 
system of defining exercise duration will allow for a more solid framework from 
which researchers can extrapolate animal model data to clinical application.

OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder is associated with a decreased life expectancy of 
8-12 years. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of excess mortality. For 
the first time, we investigated the Framingham 30-year risk score of 
cardiovascular disease in patients with newly diagnosed/first-episode bipolar 
disorder, their unaffected first-degree relatives and healthy individuals.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we compared the Framingham 30-year risk 
score of cardiovascular disease in 221 patients with newly 
diagnosed/first-episode bipolar disorder, 50 of their unaffected first-degree 
relatives and 119 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals with no personal or 
first-degree family history of affective disorder. Among patients with bipolar 
disorder, we further investigated medication- and illness-related variables 
associated with cardiovascular risk.
RESULTS: The 30-year risk of cardiovascular disease was 98.5% higher in patients 
with bipolar disorder (p = 0.017) and 85.4% higher in unaffected first-degree 
relatives (p = 0.042) compared with healthy individuals in models adjusted for 
age and sex. When categorizing participants in low cardiovascular risk without 
considering age and sex distribution among participants, 81% of patients were at 
low risk, versus 92% of unaffected relatives and 89% of healthy individuals. Of 
the patients 209 (94.6%) were diagnosed within the preceding 2 years. Smoking 
was more prevalent among patients with bipolar disorder (45.2%) and their 
unaffected first-degree relatives (20.4%) compared with healthy individuals 
(12.8%). Similarly, dyslipidemia was more common among patients with bipolar 
disorder compared with healthy individuals. Treatment with psychotropic 
medication with metabolic adverse effects was associated with higher 30-year 
cardiovascular disease risk score, whereas we did not find illness-related 
variables associated with cardiovascular risk among patients with bipolar 
disorder.
CONCLUSION: We found an enhanced cardiovascular disease risk score in patients 
with newly diagnosed bipolar disorder and their unaffected first-degree 
relatives, which points to a need for specific primary preventive interventions 
against smoking and dyslipidemia in these populations.

Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (SSTIs) are some of the most commonly occurring 
bacterial infections, with a wide range of possible etiological pathogens and a 
considerable variety of clinical presentations and severity; from mild to severe 
life-threatening infections. Several classifications have been proposed based on 
a specific variable, such as anatomical localization, skin extension, 
progression rate, clinical presentation, severity, and etiological agent. Areas 
covered: The last criteria allows the differentiation of SSTIs as monomicrobial 
and polymicrobial. Among them, especially those infections with a long lasting 
or chronic course can be sustained by multiple microbial etiology. Most 
polymicrobial SSTIs can be included in the following: diabetes foot infections 
(DFIs), pressure ulcers infection, burn infection, and infected chronic ulcers. 
Expert commentary: The medical management of these infections comprises the 
administration of wide a spectrum antibiotic, taking into consideration the 
frequent occurrence of multidrug resistant microorganisms as responsible agents. 
An appropriate deep tissue specimen for microbiological examination is a very 
important issue, especially for polymicrobial infections, sometimes permitting 
the distinction between real pathogens and contaminants avoiding more complex 
antibiotic treatments. This aspect must be strongly emphasized, as frequently 
superficial swabs remain the specimen of choice because they are easy to obtain.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines for the management of mild traumatic brain 
injury (mTBI) in the emergency department (ED) are now widely available, and 
yet, clinical practice remains inconsistent with the guidelines. The Neurotrauma 
Evidence Translation (NET) intervention was developed to increase the uptake of 
guideline recommendations and improve the management of minor head injury in 
Australian emergency departments (EDs). However, the adoption of this type of 
intervention typically entails an upfront investment that may or may not be 
fully offset by improvements in clinical practice, health outcomes and/or 
reductions in health service utilisation. The present study estimates the cost 
and cost-effectiveness of the NET intervention, as compared to the passive 
dissemination of the guideline, to evaluate whether any improvements in clinical 
practice or health outcomes due to the NET intervention can be obtained at an 
acceptable cost.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Study setting: The NET cluster randomised controlled trial 
[ACTRN12612001286831].
STUDY SAMPLE: Seventeen EDs were randomised to the control condition and 14 to 
the intervention. One thousand nine hundred forty-three patients were included 
in the analysis of clinical practice outcomes (NET sample). A total of 343 
patients from 14 control and 10 intervention EDs participated in follow-up 
interviews and were included in the analysis of patient-reported health outcomes 
(NET-Plus sample).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Appropriate post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) screening in the ED 
(primary outcome). Secondary clinical practice outcomes: provision of written 
information on discharge (INFO) and safe discharge (defined as CT scan 
appropriately provided plus PTA plus INFO). Secondary patient-reported, 
post-discharge health outcomes: anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), 
post-concussive symptoms (Rivermead), and preference-based health-related 
quality of life (SF6D).
METHODS: Trial-based economic evaluations from a health sector perspective, with 
time horizons set to coincide with the final follow-up for the NET sample 
(2 months post-intervention) and to 1-month post-discharge for the NET-Plus 
sample.
RESULTS: Intervention and control groups were not significantly different in 
health service utilisation received in the ED/inpatient ward following the 
initial mTBI presentation (adjusted mean difference $23.86 per patient; 95%CI 
- $106, $153; p = 0.719) or over the longer follow-up in the NET-plus sample 
(adjusted mean difference $341.78 per patient; 95%CI - $58, $742; p = 0.094). 
Savings from lower health service utilisation are therefore unlikely to offset 
the significantly higher upfront cost of the intervention (mean difference 
$138.20 per patient; 95%CI $135, $141; p < 0.000). Estimates of the net effect 
of the intervention on total cost (intervention cost net of health service 
utilisation) suggest that the intervention entails significantly higher costs 
than the control condition (adjusted mean difference $169.89 per patient; 95%CI 
$43, $297, p = 0.009). This effect is larger in absolute magnitude over the 
longer follow-up in the NET-plus sample (adjusted mean difference $505.06; 95%CI 
$96, $915; p = 0.016), mostly due to additional health service utilisation. For 
the primary outcome, the NET intervention is more costly and more effective than 
passive dissemination; entailing an additional cost of $1246 per additional 
patient appropriately screened for PTA ($169.89/0.1363; Fieller's 95%CI $525, 
$2055). For NET to be considered cost-effective with 95% confidence, 
decision-makers would need to be willing to trade one quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) for 25 additional patients appropriately screened for PTA. While these 
results reflect our best estimate of cost-effectiveness given the data, it is 
possible that a NET intervention that has been scaled and streamlined ready for 
wider roll-out may be more or less cost-effective than the NET intervention as 
delivered in the trial.
CONCLUSIONS: While the NET intervention does improve the management of mTBI in 
the ED, it also entails a significant increase in cost and-as delivered in the 
trial-is unlikely to be cost-effective at currently accepted funding thresholds. 
There may be a scope for a scaled-up and streamlined NET intervention to achieve 
a better balance between costs and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of lung cancer frequently occurs in its later stages. 
Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) could detect lung cancer early.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
LDCT lung cancer screening in high-risk populations.
DATA SOURCES: Bibliographic sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and 
The Cochrane Library.
METHODS: Clinical effectiveness - a systematic review of randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) comparing LDCT screening programmes with usual care (no screening) 
or other imaging screening programmes [such as chest X-ray (CXR)] was conducted. 
Bibliographic sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and The Cochrane 
Library. Meta-analyses, including network meta-analyses, were performed. 
Cost-effectiveness - an independent economic model employing discrete event 
simulation and using a natural history model calibrated to results from a large 
RCT was developed. There were 12 different population eligibility criteria and 
four intervention frequencies [(1) single screen, (2) triple screen, (3) annual 
screening and (4) biennial screening] and a no-screening control arm.
RESULTS: Clinical effectiveness - 12 RCTs were included, four of which currently 
contribute evidence on mortality. Meta-analysis of these demonstrated that LDCT, 
with ≤ 9.80 years of follow-up, was associated with a non-statistically 
significant decrease in lung cancer mortality (pooled relative risk 0.94, 95% 
confidence interval 0.74 to 1.19). The findings also showed that LDCT screening 
demonstrated a non-statistically significant increase in all-cause mortality. 
Given the considerable heterogeneity detected between studies for both outcomes, 
the results should be treated with caution. Network meta-analysis, including six 
RCTs, was performed to assess the relative clinical effectiveness of LDCT, CXR 
and usual care. The results showed that LDCT was ranked as the best screening 
strategy in terms of lung cancer mortality reduction. CXR had a 99.7% 
probability of being the worst intervention and usual care was ranked second. 
Cost-effectiveness - screening programmes are predicted to be more effective 
than no screening, reduce lung cancer mortality and result in more lung cancer 
diagnoses. Screening programmes also increase costs. Screening for lung cancer 
is unlikely to be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY), but may be cost-effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a single screen in smokers aged 60-75 
years with at least a 3% risk of lung cancer is £28,169 per QALY. Sensitivity 
and scenario analyses were conducted. Screening was only cost-effective at a 
threshold of £20,000/QALY in only a minority of analyses.
LIMITATIONS: Clinical effectiveness - the largest of the included RCTs compared 
LDCT with CXR screening rather than no screening. Cost-effectiveness - a 
representative cost to the NHS of lung cancer has not been recently estimated 
according to key variables such as stage at diagnosis. Certain costs associated 
with running a screening programme have not been included.
CONCLUSIONS: LDCT screening may be clinically effective in reducing lung cancer 
mortality, but there is considerable uncertainty. There is evidence that a 
single round of screening could be considered cost-effective at conventional 
thresholds, but there is significant uncertainty about the effect on costs and 
the magnitude of benefits.
FUTURE WORK: Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness estimates should be 
updated with the anticipated results from several ongoing RCTs [particularly the 
NEderlands Leuvens Longkanker Screenings ONderzoek (NELSON) screening trial].

Through its important role in the formation of particulate matter, atmospheric 
ammonia affects air quality and has implications for human health and life 
expectancy1,2. Excess ammonia in the environment also contributes to the 
acidification and eutrophication of ecosystems3-5 and to climate change6. 
Anthropogenic emissions dominate natural ones and mostly originate from 
agricultural, domestic and industrial activities7. However, the total ammonia 
budget and the attribution of emissions to specific sources remain highly 
uncertain across different spatial scales7-9. Here we identify, categorize and 
quantify the world's ammonia emission hotspots using a high-resolution map of 
atmospheric ammonia obtained from almost a decade of daily IASI satellite 
observations. We report 248 hotspots with diameters smaller than 50 kilometres, 
which we associate with either a single point source or a cluster of 
agricultural and industrial point sources-with the exception of one hotspot, 
which can be traced back to a natural source. The state-of-the-art EDGAR 
emission inventory10 mostly agrees with satellite-derived emission fluxes within 
a factor of three for larger regions. However, it does not adequately represent 
the majority of point sources that we identified and underestimates the 
emissions of two-thirds of them by at least one order of magnitude. Industrial 
emitters in particular are often found to be displaced or missing. Our results 
suggest that it is necessary to completely revisit the emission inventories of 
anthropogenic ammonia sources and to account for the rapid evolution of such 
sources over time. This will lead to better health and environmental impact 
assessments of atmospheric ammonia and the implementation of suitable nitrogen 
management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Home-based neonatal care is associated with a reduction in neonatal 
mortality in settings with poor access to health facility-based care. The first 
day of a child's life is a day of unparalleled opportunity to spare lives and 
sets the level for a sound future. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
prevalence and timing of home-based neonatal care by health extension workers 
(HEWs) in the rural Sidama Zone of southern Ethiopia.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted, 
and a total of 2,040 mothers who had a live birth in the last 6 months were 
studied from 1 to 31 January 2017. Interviewer-administered data were collected 
using a standard questionnaire developed by the Saving Newborn Lives Program. A 
descriptive analysis and logistic regression analyses were done.
RESULTS: It was found that 252/2,040 (12.4%) mothers and their neonates were 
visited by the HEWs during the first month of birth. Out of all households who 
had a history of visits, 139 (55.2%) had a single visit. Of these, only 66/252 
(26.2%) of the first visit were within the first 24 hours. Mothers who received 
postnatal home visit by the HEWs were at 1.35 times greater odds to have good 
postnatal practice compared to unvisited mothers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 
1.35, 95% CI [1, 1.71]). Mothers who gave their last birth at home were 36% less 
likely to have good postnatal practice compared to those who gave birth in a 
health institution (AOR 0.64, 95% CI [0.53, 0.79]).
CONCLUSION: Majority of the neonates did not get the recommended number and 
frequency of home visits. Postnatal home visit by HEWs had a great role in 
mothers having good postnatal practice. Therefore, all stakeholders should give 
attention on strengthening supportive supervision, proper implementation of 
community-based maternal and neonatal care is very crucial.

BACKGROUND: Over 500,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with ovarian or 
endometrial cancer each year. We have used a two-step strategy to identify 
plasma proteins that could be used to improve the diagnosis of women with an 
indication of gynecologic tumor and in population screening.
METHODS: In the discovery step we screened 441 proteins in plasma using the 
proximity extension assay (PEA) and five Olink Multiplex assays (CVD II, CVD 
III, INF I, ONC II, NEU I) in women with ovarian cancer (n = 106), endometrial 
cancer (n = 74), benign ovarian tumors (n = 150) and healthy population controls 
(n = 399). Based on the discovery analyses a set of 27 proteins were selected 
and two focused multiplex PEA assays were developed. In a replication step the 
focused assays were used to study an independent set of cases with ovarian 
cancer (n = 280), endometrial cancer (n = 228), women with benign ovarian tumors 
(n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 57).
RESULTS: In the discovery step, 27 proteins that showed an association to cancer 
status were identified. In the replication analyses, the focused assays 
distinguished benign tumors from ovarian cancer stage III-IV with a sensitivity 
of 0.88 and specificity of 0.92 (AUC = 0.92). The assays had a significantly 
higher AUC for distinguishing benign tumors from late stage ovarian cancer than 
using CA125 and HE4 (p = 9.56e-22). Also, population controls could be 
distinguished from ovarian cancer stage III-IV with a sensitivity of 0.85 and a 
specificity of 0.92 (AUC = 0.89).
CONCLUSION: The PEA assays represent useful tools for identification of new 
biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. The selected protein assays could be used to 
distinguish benign tumors from ovarian and endometrial cancer in women diagnosed 
with an unknown suspicious pelvic mass. The panels could also be used in 
population screening, for identification of women in need of specialized 
gynecologic transvaginal ultrasound examination.

For animals that harbor photosynthetic symbionts within their tissues, such as 
corals, the different relative contributions of autotrophy versus heterotrophy 
to organismal energetic requirements have direct impacts on fitness. This is 
especially true for facultatively symbiotic corals, where the balance between 
host-caught and symbiont-produced energy can be altered substantially to meet 
the variable demands of a shifting environment. In this study, we utilized a 
temperate coral-algal system (the northern star coral, Astrangia poculata, and 
its photosynthetic endosymbiont, Symbiodinium psygmophilum) to explore the 
impacts of nutritional sourcing on the host's health and ability to regenerate 
experimentally excised polyps. For fed and starved colonies, wound healing and 
total colony tissue cover were differentially impacted by heterotrophy versus 
autotrophy. There was an additive impact of positive nutritional and symbiotic 
states on a coral's ability to initiate healing, but a greater influence of 
symbiont state on the recovery of lost tissue at the lesion site and complete 
polyp regeneration. On the other hand, regardless of symbiont state, fed corals 
maintained a higher overall colony tissue cover, which also enabled more active 
host behavior (polyp extension) and endosymbiont behavior (photosynthetic 
ability of Symbiondinium). Overall, we determined that the impact of nutritional 
state and symbiotic state varied between biological functions, suggesting a 
diversity in energetic sourcing for each of these processes.

Resource limitations often prevent the active management required to maintain 
habitat quality in protected areas. Because restrictions in access or allowable 
public activities are the sole conservation measure in these locations, an 
important question to consider is whether species of conservation concern truly 
benefit from parcels that are shielded from human disturbance. Here, we assess 
the conservation benefit of protecting birds from human recreation on over 
204 km of sandy beaches by (a) estimating the total area of beach-nesting bird 
habitat that has been created by conservation protections; (b) quantifying the 
change in nesting habitat extent should further conservation protections be 
implemented; and (c) providing data to inform future protected area expansion. 
We use a maximum entropy species distribution modeling approach to estimate the 
extent and quality of suitable habitat for four beach-nesting bird species of 
conservation concern under the existing management regime and compare it to 
scenarios in which the entire study area is either unprotected of fully 
protected from human disturbance. Managing humans has dramatic conservation 
returns for least terns and piping plovers, creating extensive nesting habitat 
that otherwise would not exist. There is considerable scope for conservation 
gains, potentially tripling the extent of nesting areas. Expanding conservation 
footprints for American oystercatchers and black skimmers is predicted to 
enhance the quality of existing nesting areas. The work demonstrates the utility 
of modeling changes in habitat suitability to inform protected area expansion on 
ocean beaches and coastal dunes.

Since 1996, the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) has improved, 
while their risk of cancer is 2-3 times higher than in the general population. 
HIV-associated cancers remain a critical issue in this population and represent 
a particular care challenge due to the high risk of drug interactions and 
additive toxicity. The new standards of care with immunotherapy will also become 
a major issue for PLWHIV because of the potential impact on immunology and 
virology. Thus, the National Cancer Institute created the CANCERVIH national 
network in 2014 in France, enabling the establishment of a multidisciplinary 
national board of experts. This is an important first step that will help 
patients and health professionals provide optimal treatment to PLWHIV and 
prevent disparities. We hope that such a multidisciplinary council will make its 
voice heard in other countries and that this could be useful for patients with 
HIV-related cancers.

Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have experienced considerable instability in 
mortality since the 1960s. Long periods of stagnating life expectancy were 
followed by rapid increases in life expectancy and, in some cases, even more 
rapid declines, before more recent periods of improvement. These trends have 
been well documented, but to date, no study has comprehensively explored trends 
in lifespan variation. We improved such analyses by incorporating life disparity 
as a health indicator alongside life expectancy, examining trends since the 
1960s for 12 countries from the region. Generally, life disparity was high and 
fluctuated strongly over the period. For nearly 30 of these years, life 
expectancy and life disparity varied independently of each other, largely 
because mortality trends ran in opposite directions over different ages. 
Furthermore, we quantified the impact of large classes of diseases on life 
disparity trends since 1994 using a newly harmonized cause-of-death time series 
for eight countries in the region. Mortality patterns in CEE countries were 
heterogeneous and ran counter to the common patterns observed in most developed 
countries. They contribute to the discussion about life expectancy disparity by 
showing that expansion/compression levels do not necessarily mean lower/higher 
life expectancy or mortality deterioration/improvements.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is uncommon with potentially 
serious complications that may manifest in infancy and childhood.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of our study was to describe the short-term and 
long-term outcomes of neonatal PVT.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted from 2008 to 2016 of 
neonates diagnosed with PVT. A systematic review was also performed from 2000 to 
2018 to evaluate anticoagulant therapy (ACT) in neonatal PVT.
RESULTS: Forty-four premature and 30 term infants (mean gestational age 30.7 vs 
39.1 weeks, respectively) had PVT. Sixty-eight involved the left portal vein, 
one involved only the main portal vein, and 5 involved ≥1 vein. PVT was catheter 
associated in 46 (62%); none of the 7 neonates tested had thrombophilia. Of 74 
neonates, 19 (26%) received ACT and 55 (74%) were untreated. The mean follow-up 
duration was 16.6 months (SD = 17.62; range, 0-89.6); 59.5% were followed for ≥6 
months. On last ultrasound examination, thrombus resolution was documented in 
treated (ACT; n = 19) and nontreated (n = 55) neonates: 12 (63%) versus 32 (58%) 
with complete resolution, 1 (5%) versus 6 (11%) partial, 0 versus 1 (2%) 
extension, and 6 (32%) versus 16 (29%) had nonprogressive lesions, respectively. 
Seventy-one (96%) had no complications. Seventy-one articles met inclusion 
criteria for the systematic review and 19 were retained for analysis after 
assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: PVT resolution rate was similar to previous reports. Although a low 
complication rate was detected, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the 
need for early treatment and the precise incidence of outcomes such as portal 
hypertension.

In cells, intra- and intermolecular interactions of proteins confer function, 
and the dynamic modulation of this interactome is critical to meet the changing 
needs required to support life. Cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) 
enable the detection of both intra- and intermolecular protein interactions in 
organelles, cells, tissues, and organs. Quantitative XL-MS enables the detection 
of interactome changes in cells due to environmental, phenotypic, 
pharmacological, or genetic perturbations. We have developed new informatics 
capabilities, the first to enable 3D visualization of multiple quantitative 
interactome data sets, acquired over time or with varied perturbation levels, to 
reveal relevant dynamic interactome changes. These new tools are integrated 
within release 3.0 of our online cross-linked peptide database and analysis tool 
suite XLinkDB. With the recent rapid expansion in XL-MS for protein structural 
studies and the extension to quantitative XL-MS measurements, 3D interactome 
visualization tools are of critical need.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic noncancer pain is an increasing problem in elderly 
because of rising life expectancy together with an increase of potentially 
painful medical conditions. Concomitantly, adequate treatment of elderly is 
often limited by coexisting diseases and polypharmacy.This review summarizes the 
most important specifics presented by elderly patients and discusses the 
pharmacological and nonpharmacological options of pain management.
RECENT FINDINGS: A comprehensive pain assessment is a prerequisite for effective 
pain management. However, this can be a major challenge in patients who are 
unable to communicate adequately, that is, in patients with dementia. A recently 
developed electronic tool assessing automated facial expression and clinical 
behavioral indicators may help to solve this problem. The discussion about 
benefits and harms of opioids in elderly goes on. Although some authors 
underline the lack of efficacy together with the potential problems, such as, 
abuse, others report a beneficial effect in terms of pain relief, functional 
activities and disability. In addition, opioids have become an important 
treatment option in patients with restless legs syndrome. Various topical 
treatment options (i.e. capsaicin patch) and nonpharmacological interventions 
have been proven to be beneficial in elderly.
SUMMARY: Adequate pain management of elderly patients constitutes numerous 
pharmacological options including nonopioids, opioids, coanalgesics and topical 
agents. Due to age-related characteristics, all systemic analgesics have to be 
given very cautiously ('start low, go slow'). Whenever possible, treatment 
should be performed as a multimodal approach based on the biopsychosocial model 
of chronic pain.
