Transcription of the clpP-clpX operon of Escherichia coli leads to the 
production of two different sizes of transcripts. In log phase, the level of the 
longer transcript is higher than the level of the shorter transcript. Soon after 
the onset of carbon starvation, the level of the shorter transcript increases 
significantly, and the level of the longer transcript decreases. The longer 
transcript consists of the entire clpP-clpX operon, whereas the shorter 
transcript contains the entire clpP gene but none of the clpX coding sequence. 
The RpoH protein is required for the increase in the level of the shorter 
transcript during carbon starvation. Primer extension experiments suggest that 
there is increased usage of the sigma(32)-dependent promoter of the clpP-clpX 
operon within 15 min after the start of carbon starvation. Expression of the 
clpP-clpX operon from the promoters upstream of the clpP gene decreases to a 
very low level by 20 min after the onset of carbon starvation. Various pieces of 
evidence suggest, though they do not conclusively prove, that production of the 
shorter transcript may involve premature termination of the longer transcript. 
The half-life of the shorter transcript is much less than that of the longer 
transcript during carbon starvation. E. coli rpoB mutations that affect 
transcription termination efficiency alter the ratio of the shorter clpP-clpX 
transcript to the longer transcript. The E. coli rpoB3595 mutant, with an RNA 
polymerase that terminates transcription with lower efficiency than the wild 
type, accumulates a lower percentage of the shorter transcript during carbon 
starvation than does the isogenic wild-type strain. In contrast, the rpoB8 
mutant, with an RNA polymerase that terminates transcription with higher 
efficiency than the wild type, produces a higher percentage of the shorter 
clpP-clpX transcript when E. coli is in log phase. These and other data are 
consistent with the hypothesis that the shorter transcript results from 
premature transcription termination during production of the longer transcript.

HYPOTHESIS: Eradication of esophageal varices by repeated injection 
sclerotherapy and maintenance of eradication using continued surveillance 
endoscopy may reduce recurrent variceal bleeding and death from esophageal 
varices.
DESIGN: A prospective study of consecutive adult patients with endoscopically 
proved esophageal variceal bleeding.
SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital in a metropolitan area.
PATIENTS: Two hundred four patients (127 men and 77 women; mean age, 50.1 years; 
age range, 16-82 years) underwent 993 emergency and elective variceal endoscopic 
injection treatments with 5% ethanolamine oleate during 1992 endoscopy sessions. 
Most (166 [81.4%]) had cirrhosis, mainly due to alcohol abuse (131 [78. 9%]). 
The number of patients with each modified Pugh-Child risk grade was as follows: 
A, 30; B, 91; and C, 83. (The modified Pugh-Child classification comprises 
ascites, encephalopathy, serum albumin and bilirubin levels, and prothrombin 
time. Each variable is given a value of 1 to 3 with increasing impairment of 
liver function. Addition of the values leads to the Pugh-Child risk grades for 
each patient, with 5 and 6 giving grade A; 7 through 9, grade B; and 10 through 
15, grade C, respectively.)
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (46.6%) rebled at a median of 17 days (range, 
0-2583 days). Seventy-four patients (36.3%) had a total of 112 further bleeding 
episodes before eradication of varices. Varices were eradicated in 99 (87.6%) of 
113 patients who survived longer than 3 months after a median of 5 injections 
and remained eradicated in 43 (mean follow-up after eradication, 38 months; 
range, 4-125 months). Rebleeding was markedly reduced after eradication of 
varices. Varices recurred in 56 patients, of whom only 10 rebled from recurrent 
esophageal varices. Cumulative survival by life table analysis was 55%, 41%, and 
30% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. One hundred thirty-seven patients 
(67.2%) died during follow-up. Liver failure was the most common cause of death. 
Minor complications (mucosal ulceration) occurred in 105 patients. Major 
complications, including a localized injection site leak (n = 9), esophageal 
stenosis (n = 25), and esophageal perforation (n = 5), occurred in 39 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated injection sclerotherapy eradicated esophageal varices in 
most long-term patients. Complications related to injection sclerotherapy were 
mostly minor. Complete eradication of varices reduced rebleeding and death from 
esophageal varices.

    Ann Intern Med. 2001 Sep 4;135(5):381-2.

BACKGROUND: Not all patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C 
progress to cirrhosis.
OBJECTIVE: To compare no antiviral treatment, periodic liver biopsy with 
subsequent antiviral treatment for moderate hepatitis or cirrhosis, and 
immediate antiviral therapy.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Clinical trial data and published studies.
TARGET POPULATION: Hepatitis C virus-infected patients with histologically mild 
hepatitis.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Immediate combination antiviral treatment or biopsy every 3 years 
plus combination antiviral therapy for moderate hepatitis or cirrhosis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and costs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Over 20 years, biopsy every 3 years with 
treatment of moderate hepatitis would avoid treatment in 50% of the cohort and 
would result in an 18% likelihood of cirrhosis compared with 16% for immediate 
treatment and 27% for no antiviral therapy. Immediate antiviral treatment should 
increase life expectancy by 1.0 quality-adjusted life-year compared with biopsy 
management. Over an average lifetime, biopsy management would lead to six liver 
biopsies costing $6200; immediate antiviral treatment would cost $5100 less than 
biopsy management because of savings related to biopsy and prevention of future 
hepatitis C-related morbidity. Immediate therapy was cost-effective compared 
with biopsy management and had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $7000 compared with 
no antiviral therapy.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: When age, sex, genotype, and estimates of 
histologic progression or compliance with follow-up are varied, immediate 
therapy should result in an increase of at least 0. 8 quality-adjusted life-year 
compared with biopsy management.
CONCLUSION: For histologically mild chronic hepatitis C, initial combination 
treatment compared with periodic liver biopsy should reduce the future risk for 
cirrhosis, prolong life, and be cost-effective.

[Increased clinical and economic advantages using PROSIT (proteinuria screening 
and intervention) in type 2 diabetic patients].

[Article in German]

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Even though there are simple and cost-effective means 
for the early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy, only a small proportion of 
diabetics in Germany is regularly tests for microalbuminuria. On the basis of 
evidence-based knowledge and of international guidelines the PROSIT project 
(proteinuria screening and intervention) aims to make good this deficiency in 
the German Federal Republic by introducing nephropathy screening and a 
structured intervention to improve blood sugar and blood pressure regulation, 
optimizing lipid metabolism and nutritional intake. It was the aim of this study 
to assess with a computer-aided diabetes model the clinical value and 
cost-effectiveness of such an intervention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From data collected for 589 diabetics who participated in 
the PROSIT project, the short-time effects after one year on HbA1c, systolic 
blood pressure and lipid levels were obtained and cost-effectiveness compared 
with that of standard care. Life expectancy, life-time costs to be met by health 
insurance and event frequency of the diabetic nephropathy stages were calculated 
with a Markov model for type 2 diabetics.
RESULTS: PROSIT improved individual life expectancy by 0.23 years with reduction 
of life-time costs by DM 9,772 (ca. $4,900). The cumulative incidence of 
microalbuminuria was lowered by 30.5%, that of terminal renal failure by 55.9%. 
Even after discounting the results (i.e. the inclusion of time preference for 
cost and benefit) and stepwise changes of all variables by +/- 10%, PROSIT 
remained the more cost-effective variant.
CONCLUSION: From a health economy viewpoint PROSIT is superior to standard 
management. Early recognition of albuminuria and the introduction of a 
multifactorial treatment strategy make it possible to delay progression to 
terminal renal failure. In addition to its clinical benefits, prevention of 
dialysis and transplantation would reduce the annual savings of the health care 
system by several billion DM.

Hepatocellular carcinoma : treated with hepatic arterial embolization, an 
analysis of prognostic features in 150 cases.

Thailand.

From July 1989 to July 1999, 120 male and 30 female patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), whose ages ranged from 18 to 71 years, were treated by 
different modalities. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to 
treatment modalities: group 1 consisted of 35 cases treated by transarterial 
embolization (TAE) using gelatin sponge permeated with mitomycin-c 20 mg, group 
2 - 100 cases treated by transcatheter oily chemoembolization (TOCE) using 
lipiodol 10 cc with mitomycin-c 20 mg together with gelatin sponge for hepatic 
embolization, and group 3 - 15 cases treated by TOCE followed by surgical wedge 
hepatic resection. The prognostic features following treatments were 
retrospectively analysed in relation to therapeutic modalities. The results 
revealed that TOCE was superior to TAE and that TOCE plus adjunct wedge hepatic 
resection was the best treatment modality with the best cumulative surgical rate 
(median survival 46.69 months). Analysis of the life-table methods of group 2 
patients revealed that the stage of tumors and serum biochemistry on entry, both 
of which corresponded well with hepatic reserve function were statistically 
significant prognostic factors for treatment result and long-term outcomes. 
Further analysis of all the patients also revealed that tumor size and stage of 
tumors were significant prognostic factors for the treatment of hepatocellular 
carcinomas.

[Diagnosis and treatment of diabetes in adult patients with cystic fibrosis].

[Article in French]

Robert JJ(1), Mosnier-Pudar H.

(1)Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris.

As their life expectancy has improved, patients with cystic fibrosis have 
experienced an increasing incidence of diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is 
characterized by improved and delayed insulin secretion, normal insulin 
sensitivity, and it is most often accompanied by exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency. The development of diabetes mellitus is insidious and 
symptomless, and the overall cystic fibrosis status deteriorate for years prior 
to the diagnosis of diabetes. Since insulin therapy seems to revert 
deterioration for years of clinical status, and since late diabetic 
complications may develop, diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis should be 
identified by screening with an OGTT from the age of 15 years, and treated with 
insulin from the time of diagnosis of diabetes.

    J Epidemiol Community Health. 2000 Dec;54(12):884.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the long term evolution of mortality in the former German 
Democratic Republic (GDR) in the period from 1960 and its specific position in 
health terms compared with the Federal Republic (FRG) in the west and Poland in 
the east.
METHODS: Decomposition of life expectancy by age and cause of death. Differences 
in life expectancy at birth between the former GDR and the old FRG were 
decomposed by age using data on all cause mortality for the period 1960 to 1997. 
Changes in life expectancy over time by cause of death were examined using data 
for 1974 and 1989 for both parts of Germany and for 1974 and 1988 for Poland.
RESULTS: Male life expectancy in the two parts of Germany diverged twice, in the 
mid-1960s, favouring the GDR, and in the mid-1970s, giving increasing advantage 
to the FRG, while female life expectancy remained similar until the mid-1970s 
and began to diverge thereafter. The initial advantage of the GDR was mainly 
attributable to an improving mortality rate among children compared with that in 
the west in both sexes. During the 1980s, mortality among men over 15 and women 
over 40 steadily worsened relative to their western counterparts, although men 
were doing considerably better than those in Poland who actually experienced 
deterioration. In the FRG, falling death rates among adults of all ages have 
contributed substantially to the improvement in life expectancy between 1974 and 
1989, largely attributable to falling deaths from cardiovascular disease and 
from injuries at younger adult ages. In Poland, death rates among male adults 
have risen at all ages over 35, mostly attributable to worsening death rates 
from cardiovascular disease and neoplasms while women experienced stagnation. 
The GDR showed a small worsening among men under 60, counterbalanced by 
improvements among those over 60, and some improvement in women, attributable to 
falling deaths from cardiovascular disease among the middle aged and elderly.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence for the complexity of the 
east-west mortality differential emerging in the 1960s in Europe, highlighting 
the intermediate position in health terms the former GDR occupied during much of 
the communist period. Further research is required to assess the underlying 
causes for the specific position of the former GDR between east and west.

Changing mortality patterns in East and West Germany and Poland. II: short-term 
trends during transition and in the 1990s.

OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in life expectancy at birth and age and cause 
specific patterns of mortality in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) 
and Poland during political transition and throughout the 1990s in both parts of 
Germany and in Poland.
METHODS: Decomposition of life expectancy by age and cause of death. Changes in 
life expectancy during transition by cause of death were examined using data for 
1988/89 and 1990/91 for the former GDR and Poland; examination of life 
expectancy changes after transition were based on 1992-97 data for Germany and 
1991-96 data for Poland.
RESULTS: In both the former GDR and Poland male life expectancy at birth 
declined by almost one year during transition, mainly attributable to rising 
death rates from external causes and circulatory diseases. Female life 
expectancy in Poland deteriorated by 0.3 years, largely attributable to 
increasing circulatory mortality among the old, while in East German female 
rising death rates in children and young adults were nearly outbalanced by 
declining circulatory mortality among those over 70. Between 1991/92 and 
1996/97, male life expectancy at birth increased by 2.4 years in the former GDR, 
1.2 years in old Federal Republic, and 2.0 years in Poland (women: 2.3, 0.9, and 
1.2 years). In East Germany and Poland, the overall improvement was largely 
attributable to falling mortality among men aged 40-64, while those over 65 
contributed the largest proportion to life expectancy gains in women. The change 
in deaths among men aged 15-39 accounted for 0.4 of a year to life expectancy at 
birth in East Germany and Poland, attributable largely to greater decreases from 
external causes. Among those over 40, absolute contributions to changing life 
expectancy were greater in the former GDR than in the other two entities in both 
sexes, largely attributable to circulatory diseases. A persisting East-west life 
expectancy gap in Germany of 2.1 years in men in 1997 was largely attributable 
to external causes, diseases of the digestive system and circulatory diseases. 
Higher death rates from circulatory diseases among the elderly largely explain 
the female life expectancy gap of approximately one year.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further insights into the health effects of 
political transition. Post-transition improvements in life expectancy and 
mortality have been much steeper in East Germany compared with Poland. Changes 
in dietary pattern and, in Germany, medical care may have been important factors 
in shaping post-transition mortality trends.

90095, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The goal was to analyze the outcome of surgical therapy for buccal 
carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was done.
SETTING: The study took place in a major tertiary-care hospital.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients received first-time surgical therapy for buccal 
carcinoma. Treatment was surgery alone in 15 and surgery followed by radiation 
therapy in 6 patients. Six additional patients received surgical salvage for 
radiation therapy failure. Composite resection of the tumor was performed in 16 
patients (59%). Five-year observed actuarial survival rates were 100%, 45%, 67%, 
and 78%, and locoregional recurrence rates were 0%, 27%, 44%, and 0% for stages 
I to IV, respectively. The 5-year actuarial survival rates were 80% after 
surgery and 82% after surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Patients who 
underwent surgical salvage after radiation therapy failure had a 1-year survival 
rate of 0%.
CONCLUSION: Aggressive surgical treatment of buccal carcinoma may result in 
better survival rates.
SIGNIFICANCE: The article analyzes buccal carcinoma in regards to the patterns 
of presentation, treatments rendered, and patterns of failure.

Analysis of falling mortality rates in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Watt GC(1), Ecob R.

Author information:
(1)Department of General Practice, University of Glasgow. 
G.C.M.Watt@clinmed.gla.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to describe and interpret trends in 
mortality in Glasgow and Edinburgh
METHODS: A comparison was made between observed all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality rates for 1989-1993 for men and women aged 35-74 and rates predicted 
on the basis of modelled mortality data for residents of Glasgow and Edinburgh 
aged 25-74 in quinquennia based on Census years 1961, 1971 and 1981.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality rates fell between 1979-1983 and 1989-1993 by a 
larger amount in Edinburgh than in Glasgow (24.5 versus 14.5 per cent in men; 
20.4 versus 10.5 per cent in women). Differences in life expectancy between the 
cities at age 35 increased by 44 per cent to 4.7 years in men and by 19 per cent 
to 2.5 years in women. Mortality rates improved in all age and sex groups but 
trends were least favourable in Edinburgh men and women aged 35-44. Mortality 
rates in both cities fell by a larger amount than predicted, by 10 per cent in 
men and 6 per cent in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The widening of differences in life expectancy between Glasgow and 
Edinburgh is mainly due to a historical trend of longevity increasing more 
quickly in Edinburgh. Although precise explanations are not possible, it seems 
likely that this difference between the cities is explained in large measure by 
their consistently and markedly contrasting socio-economic profiles. Comparison 
of the cities conceals, however, a trend of falling mortality rates in both 
populations, comprising most of the observed reduction in mortality rates in 
Glasgow, which appears to result in part from factors operating in the short 
term. Interpretation of trends in cause-specific mortality rates needs to take 
account of the possibility of long-term and short-term trends in all-cause 
mortality in different social groups.

This article outlines a community-based retrospective study in a remote area of 
Nepal and describes local birth practices and their impact on infant mortality. 
Data collection was carried out in two steps, a household survey from September 
to October 1996 and a qualitative research phase. Data collected include 
socio-economic background, reproductive history, birth practices and child 
survival. Among 3007 live-born children, 660 (22%) died before their first 
birthday. In keeping with local customs, approximately half of the children were 
delivered in an animal shed and the other half in the home. Children born in an 
animal shed were at significantly higher risk of dying than were those born in 
the home even after adjusting for socio-economic status and biological 
variables. The association was stronger in the neonatal period (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 
1.9-4.1) than during the post-neonatal period (OR= 1.3, 95% CI 1.02-1.6). The 
preparation of the delivery place was inadequate and thereby facilitated 
infection of both the newborn and the mother. Traditional norms and animal-shed 
delivery practices are common in the Jumla community. The reasons addressed for 
giving birth in the animal shed included (1) Household Deity's anger if delivery 
takes place in the home and (2) easy to clean the shed following the birth.

Modelling the dynamics of scarlet fever epidemics in the 19th century.

Annual deaths from scarlet fever in Liverpool, UK during 1848-1900 have been 
used as a model system for studying the historical dynamics of the epidemics. 
Mathematical models are developed which include the growth of the population and 
the death rate from scarlet fever. Time-series analysis of the results shows 
that there were two distinct phases to the disease (i) 1848-1880: regular 
epidemics (wavelength = 3.7 years) consistent with the system being driven by an 
oscillation in the transmission coefficient (deltabeta) at its resonant 
frequency, probably associated with dry conditions in winter (ii) 1880-1900: an 
undriven SEIR system with a falling endemic level and decaying epidemics. This 
period was associated with improved nutritive levels. There is also evidence 
from time-series analysis that raised wheat prices in pregnancy caused increased 
susceptibility in the subsequent children. The pattern of epidemics and the 
demographic characteristics of the population can be replicated in the modelling 
which provides insights into the detailed epidemiology of scarlet fever in this 
community in the 19th century.

School, The Netherlands.

Information on the life expectancy of Bjork-Shiley convexo-concave (BScc) valve 
recipients is necessary when considering prophylactic replacement. However, 
little is known about the late results after valve replacement with BScc valves. 
We describe long-term survival and its determinants of the Dutch BScc cohort and 
compare mortality figures with those of the general population and those used in 
guidelines for prophylactic replacement. Follow-up was obtained on all Dutch 
BScc valve recipients (n = 2,264) (end of study 1996). Survival over a 15-year 
period and its determinants were described using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit 
method and Cox regression, respectively. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) 
were used to compare mortality rates of BScc valve recipients who survived at 
least 30 days after surgery with the Dutch population rates. Survival at 15 
years for aortic, mitral, and double valve recipients was 55.0% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 51.9 to 58.1), 40.8% (95% CI 37.1 to 44.4), and 38.6% (95% CI 33.2 
to 43.9), respectively. The determinants of survival were patient, history, and 
procedure related. The SMR for all BScc valve recipients was 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 
5.2) in the first year of follow-up, after which it decreased to 2.0 (95% CI 1.8 
to 2.3) and remained constant until the 14th year. SMRs depended on time since 
implantation, age at the time of implantation, and position of the valve 
replaced. Most of life expectancy estimates in prophylactic replacement 
guidelines of BScc valves underrate the true survival estimates. Age, valve 
position, and time- specific risks of death after valvular surgery should be 
accounted for. Different excess mortality rates should be applied for patients 
from different age groups: the older the patient the lower the excess.

Increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were found in patients with chronic renal 
failure. These correlate with the severity of renal failure. Patients with 
elevated ET-1 concentrations show an increased cardiovascular mortality. The 
prevalence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a very important 
factor for survival and morbidity in uremic patients The aim of this study was 
to assess the protective effect of ET-receptor antagonists in chronic uremia. 
Sprague Dawley rats were subtotally nephrectomized (SNX) and treated either with 
the endothelin-A- (ET(A)) receptor antagonist LU302146 or with the unselective 
ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist LU302872 (30 mg/kgbw/day both). After subtotal 
nephrectomy protein excretion SNX (130.0 +/- 22.5 mg/24 h) was increased in 
comparison to the ET(A)-group (446 +/- 103 mg/24 h) and the ET(AB)-group (23.2 
+/- 37 mg/24 h) vs sham: 115 +/- 19 mg/24 h). Heart weight was decreased by the 
ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist LU302146. Left ventricular contractility was 
impaired in SNX by about 40%. Treatment with the ET-receptor antagonists 
prevented the impairment in left ventricular function. Our study results provide 
a possible therapeutic approach using ET receptor antagonists to reduce cardiac 
hypertrophy and renal proteinuria. Further human studies are needed to show 
whether this protection of the heart and kidney might influence the survival and 
life-expectancy of patients suffering from chronic renal failure.

Multi-targeted antifolate (MTA): pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal 
administration in a rat model.

Pestieau SR(1), Stuart OA, Sugarbaker PH.

Street, NW, Washington, DC 20010, USA.

AIMS: LY 231514 or MTA is a multi-targeted antifolate which has been used as an 
anticancer drug. It is an analogue of folic acid which has shown antitumour 
activity against various malignancies, particularly mesothelioma and colon 
cancer. For cancers with peritoneal surfaces extension, the advantage of 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy over intravenous chemotherapy administration is the 
high drug concentration that can be achieved locally. Using a rat model, this 
study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetics and tissue adsorption of 
intraperitoneal vs intravenous MTA.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups according to dose 
and route of delivery of chemotherapy (10 mg/kg: intravenous; 10 mg/kg: 
intraperitoneal; 100 mg/kg: intraperitoneal). During the course of the 
experiment, peritoneal fluid and blood were sampled using a standardized 
protocol. At the end of the 3 hour procedure the rats were sacrificed, all urine 
was extracted and selected tissue samples were taken. One additional rat was 
studied over a 6 hour period for each group. The concentration of MTA in all 
samples was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
RESULTS: When MTA was delivered at 10 mg/kg the area under the curve (AUC) of 
the peritoneal fluid was significantly higher with intraperitoneal 
administration (10 778 microg/mlxmin) compared to intravenous administration 
(454 microg/mlxmin) (P<0.0001). This represents a 24-fold increase in exposure 
for tissues at peritoneal surfaces after intraperitoneal administration. The AUC 
ratio (AUC peritoneal fluid/AUC plasma) was 40.8 for intraperitoneal delivery as 
opposed to 0.014 for intravenous delivery (P=0.0063). The AUC ratio for 
intraperitoneal MTA at 100 mg/kg was 19.2. The half-life of MTA in the 
peritoneal fluid after intraperitoneal infusion was approximately 2 hours. There 
was a significant difference in MTA concentration in the mesenteric nodes and 
the abdominal wall (P=0. 0036 and 0.0017) and in the kidneys (P=0.0122) when 
intraperitoneal and intravenous administration were compared. Other tissue 
samples did not demonstrate any difference in drug concentration.
CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrated that the exposure of peritoneal 
surfaces to MTA is significantly increased with intraperitoneal MTA 
administration. Due to the high likelihood of microscopic residual disease after 
resection of intra-abdominal malignancies, clinical studies to evaluate 
intraperitoneal MTA may be indicated.

type.

The appropriateness of admitting individuals to hospice services is determined 
by assessing the individual's 6-month survival prognosis. Clinical parameters 
that guide clinicians in assessing prognosis, however, are not well defined in 
cases of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) when compared to other 
illnesses. The Alzheimer's-Hospice Placement Evaluation Scale (AHOPE) was 
developed to assess the 6-month prognosis of individuals with late-stage DAT. 
The purposes of this study were to estimate the reliability and predictive 
validity of AHOPE and to test additional demographic and clinical indicators to 
determine their added contribution to predicting 6-month survival and hospice 
appropriateness. Data were collected on 112 long-term care residents with DAT at 
enrollment and 6 months following enrollment. Initial reliability and predictive 
validity of AHOPE were supported. Other demographic and clinical indicators were 
not predictors of 6-month survival. Although additional research is indicated, 
nurses can use AHOPE to enhance clinical observation and decision making for 
implementing appropriate care strategies for patients with end-stage DAT and 
their families.

MMP-9, which degrades extracellular matrix, is believed to play a crucial role 
in tumor invasion and metastasis. Angiogenesis is also perceived as an important 
step in tumor growth and metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the expression of MMP-9 in tumor samples of HNSCC patients and to study a 
possible correlation to angiogenic markers. Cryostat sections of 52 HNSCC tumors 
were immunostained for MMP-9, bFGF and VEGF using a standard streptavidin-biotin 
complex procedure for light microscopic investigation. Microvessel density (MVD) 
was determined by staining of endothelial cells immunohistochemically using 
anti-vWF monoclonal antibody. MMP-9 positive staining was detected in 27/52 
(52%) of the tumors. MMP-9 immunoreactivity did not correlate with the main 
clinicopathological characteristics of the patients (localisation, T-stage, 
N-stage, histological grading), but correlated with worse survival of the 
patients. MMP-9 negative tumors showed a significant lower mean MVD per 
microscopic field than MMP-9 positive tumors (p<0. 001). There was a significant 
association of MMP-9 and VEGF expression (p<0.05). The presence of MMP-9 in 
HNSCC cancer and the positive correlation with MVD and VEGF expression supports 
the theory that MMP-9 functions as a regulator of tumor angiogenesis supporting 
endothelial cell invasion. MMP-9 and VEGF might act co-operatively in the 
process of neovascularization in human head and neck cancer.

We determined intratumoral thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) activity in 213 
patients with T2N0M0 or T2N1M0 breast cancer. After surgery doxifluridine, an 
intermediate metabolite of capecitabine, and tamoxifen were given by mouth. 
According to dThdPase activity the examined patients were classified as: A, high 
activity group; tumors with the activity not less than the mean value and B, low 
activity group; tumors with activity less than the mean value. Group A had a 
better prognosis than group B in node-positive patients (disease-free survival, 
p=0.0446; overall survival, p=0.0788). Intratumoral dThdPase activity might be a 
useful marker for predicting responsiveness to doxifluridine treatment in the 
adjuvant setting.

p21WAF1/CIP1 protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, able to prevent the 
CDK2/cyclin E induced retinoblastoma protein (pRB) phosphorylation, thus 
inhibiting cell cycle progression at G1 phase. p21WAF1/CIP1 protein levels were 
examined in a series of 102 ovarian tissue samples including normal ovary, 
primary ovarian tumors, omental metastasis, recurrent disease and residual tumor 
after chemotherapy exposure, by Western blot analysis. The association of 
p21WAF1/CIP1 status with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome was 
also investigated. p21WAF1/CIP1 protein was detectable in 76 out of 102 (74%) 
ovarian tissue samples. We observed a significant trend of p21 levels to 
gradually increase from normal ovarian tissues (median 0 a.u.) through primary 
ovarian cancers (median 0.19 a.u.), omental metastases (median 0.33 a.u.) and 
recurrence of disease (median 0.44 a.u.) (p=0.015). In the group of stage III-IV 
ovarian cancer patients, p21-positive cases showed a more favourable prognosis 
with respect to p21-negative cases: the 3-year time to progression (TTP) rate 
was 58% for p21-positive compared with 33% of p21-negative cases (p=0.036). In 
conclusion, p21WAF1/CIP1 expression levels seem to be correlated with tumor 
status at the time of diagnosis and can predict TTP in a selected group of 
patients.

Flow cytometric DNA analysis with assessment of S-phase fraction and DNA ploidy 
was compared to Nottingham histologic grade. The study population consisted of 
654 patients who presented between 1987 and 1996 with primary operable breast 
cancer and whose tumours had been analysed for S-phase fraction and DNA ploidy 
at the time of surgery. Grade, tumour size, node status, steroid receptor 
status, age, S-phase fraction and DNA ploidy were analysed univariately and 
multi-variately in a Cox proportional hazard analysis. In the univariate 
analyses all parameters were statistically significantly associated with breast 
cancer mortality during the follow-up period of 2-11 years. The most powerful 
predictor of death from breast cancer in the multiple regression analysis was 
grade. Patients with grade 1 tumours have excellent prognosis. We conclude that 
tumour grade is a strong prognostic indicator applicable to all breast cancer 
patients, regardless of size and nodal status, and advocate its general use.

Follow-up of invasive pituitary macroadenoma in 56 patients within a duration of 
5 years.

From June 1986 to September 1996, 56(30%) patients with invasive pituitary 
macroadenoma were studied retrospectively. We compared the clinical and 
endocrinological characteristics, neuroimaging findings, and surgical outcome of 
these patients in a period of follow up of 5 years. Twenty-one patients (38%) 
were found to have a prolactinoma, 8 patients (14%) had a GH-producing adenoma, 
and 27 patients (48%) had non-functional tumors. Pituitary apoplexy was found in 
16 cases (29%). Their age ranged from 15 to 72 years and no sex difference (F:M 
= 27:29) was found. According to Hardy's classification, all the 56 tumors were 
invasive pituitary macroadenoma, of a tumor size more than 10 mm with sellar 
floor erosion partially or diffusely or paracarvenous sinus invasion. Those 
tumors were divided into grade III (tumor causing localized perforation of the 
sellar floor), and IV (tumor destroying entire sellar floor diffusely); the 
tumors were further subdivided into stage C (3rd ventricle grossly displaced), D 
(intracranial intradural extension) and E (tumors invading the cavernous sinus 
through the lateral dural envelope of the sellar). Eight out of 56 tumors 
belonged to grade III stage C, 18 tumors were grade III stage D, 8 tumors were 
grade IV stage D, and the other 22 were grade IV stage E. Fifty-one patients 
received transsphenoidal craniectomy for tumor removal, one patient took 
subfrontal craniotomy only and 4 cases received both. Most patients improved 
significantly in visual field and general quality of life after surgery. In this 
study, it was concluded that: 1) surgical intervention as quick as possible was 
proven advantageous, especially in patients with an invasive macroadenoma; 2) in 
cases with invasive pituitary macroadenomas, the patients, with grade III and IV 
tumors, had a longer symptom-free interval than those who refused surgical 
intervention and radiotherapy with the same grade tumor; 3) to achieve 
satisfactory late results, multidisciplinary treatment was necessary: 
post-operative radiotherapy ranging from 4500 to 6500 rads was done in 50 
patients, endocrine therapy in 52 patients and adjunct bromocriptine treatment 
was done in 13 patients with prolactinomas; 4) symptomatic recurrence or 
elevated postoperative hormone levels occurred in 20(35%) cases. There was a 
high incidence of recurrence in 6(6/20) GH-secreting tumors, and in 8(8/20) 
prolactinomas with preoperative prolactin levels more than 200 eta g/dl.

Life expectancy of people with intellectual disability: a 35-year follow-up 
study.

University of Helsinki, Finland.

A 35-year follow-up study based on a nation-wide population study of the life 
expectancy of people with intellectual disability (ID) was undertaken. The study 
population consisted of a total of 60,969 person-years. A prospective cohort 
study with mortality follow-up for 35 years was used and the life expectancy of 
people with ID was calculated for different levels of intelligence. Proportional 
hazard models were used to assess the influence of level of intelligence and 
associated disorders on survival. People with mild ID did not have poorer life 
expectancy than the general population and subjects with mild ID did not have 
lower life expectancy in the first 3 decades of life. In cases with profound ID, 
the proportion of expected life lost was > 20% for almost all age groups. The 
female preponderance was manifested from the age of 60 years onwards, 25 years 
later than in the general population. Respectively, survival between sexes 
differed less. Epilepsy and/or hearing impairment increased the relative risk of 
death for all levels of ID. The prevalence of people with ID over 40 years was 
0.4%. People with ID now live longer than previously expected, and the ageing of 
people with mild ID appears to be equal to that of the general population, 
posing new challenges to health care professionals.

Demography and dog-human relationships of the dog population in Zimbabwean 
communal lands.

Butler JR(1), Bingham J.

Author information:
(1)Fisheries Trust, Dundonnell, Wester Ross.

Dogs are Zimbabwe's primary vector for rabies, and the majority live in communal 
lands (traditional agropastoralist rural areas). In 1994, a household 
questionnaire survey was conducted to provide baseline data on the demography 
and dog-human relationships of the dogs in the communal lands. The survey showed 
that all the dogs were owned, and there was no evidence of a feral population. 
They were unrestricted and semi-dependent on people. The numbers of dogs per 
capita varied little in each communal land, resulting in higher dog densities in 
communal lands with higher human densities, and indicating that people were not 
intolerant of dogs at higher densities. The population turnover was rapid: the 
life expectancy of the dogs was 1.1 years, the mean age 2.0 years, and 71.8 per 
cent died in their first year. The population was heavily skewed towards 
juveniles, with 40.8 per cent aged less than 12 months. Despite the high 
juvenile mortality, the population was growing by 6.52 per cent per annum. It 
was estimated that in 1994 there were 1.36 million dogs in communal lands.

Management of malignant melanoma.

Kroon BB(1), Nieweg OE.

(1)Department of Surgery, The Netherlands Cancer Institute / Antoni van 
Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam. bkroon@nki.nl

The following guidelines are recommended in the management of malignant 
melanoma. An excisional biopsy is the appropriate diagnostic procedure for a 
skin lesion suspected of being a melanoma. The advised margin for diagnostic 
excision is 2 mm of macroscopically normal skin around the lesion; the margins 
for therapeutic excision are 1 cm of normal skin for a lesion with a Breslow 
thickness of < 2 mm and 2 cm when the Breslow thickness is > 2 and < or = 4 mm. 
A margin of at least 2 cm also appears to be justified for thicker melanomas. 
Elective lymph node dissection is not recommended. Sentinel node biopsy appears 
to be a promising method to detect occult metastases in the regional lymph 
nodes. If regional lymph node metastases are present, therapeutic regional lymph 
node dissection must be conducted. Isolated regional perfusion is indicated for 
inoperable tumour growth in an extremity. Radiotherapy can be applied 
palliatively or postoperatively (if non-radical resection is suspected). 
Adjuvant systemic therapy is still experimental. There is no standard treatment 
for patients with haematogenic metastasis and they should be entered in trials 
whenever possible. A follow-up period of 5 years is sufficient for patients with 
a melanoma of < or = 1.5 mm Breslow thickness and of 10 years when the Breslow 
thickness is > 1.5 mm. The patients should be actively involved in the follow-up 
(inspection, palpation). Regular routine blood tests and radiological 
examinations are not considered to be worthwhile. There is no evidence that the 
growth of micro-metastases is stimulated by hormonal changes during pregnancy or 
contraceptive pill use. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation should be 
discouraged.

A method is described for estimating the life-expectancy of cohorts of type 2 
diabetic patients, based on computer simulation from a parametric model. The 
method can be used where non-parametric methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate, fail due to lack of the data. The simulation algorithm combines 
observed and modelled information to estimate the life-expectancy implications 
of event rates observed within a study. The use of bootstrap methods to estimate 
confidence intervals is discussed. The methods are illustrated with results that 
have been previously published, without derivation, in a health economic 
analysis of tight blood pressure (BP) control in the UK Prospective Diabetes 
Study (UKPDS), and the application to other health economic analyses of UKPDS 
data is discussed.

Outline of a diabetes disease management model: principles and applications.

A complex interactive computer model was developed to determine the health 
outcomes and economic consequences of different diabetes interventions for 
user-defined observation periods. The interventions include intensive or 
conventional insulin therapy, different oral hypoglycaemic medications, 
different screening and treatment strategies for micro-vascular complications, 
different treatment strategies for end-stage complications, or multi-factorial 
interventions. The analyses can be performed on different sub-groups of type 1 
and 2 diabetic patients, defined in terms of age, gender, baseline risk factors 
and pre-existing complications. The model performs real-time simulations. Full 
on-screen documentation of the model structure, logic, calculations and data 
sources is available to maximize the model's transparency. Economic and clinical 
data used in the disease management model are editable by the user, allowing the 
input of new data as they become available, the creation of country-specific, 
HMO-specific, or provider-specific versions of the model, and the exploration of 
new hypotheses ('what-if' analyses). The approach used allows maximum 
flexibility, adaptability, and transparency within the model structure. For the 
user-defined patient cohorts and intervention strategies the diabetes disease 
management model compares life expectancy, expected incidence and prevalence of 
complications as well as expected life-time (or shorter) treatment cost. 
Diabetes and complication management strategies can be compared in different 
patient populations in a variety of realistic clinical settings. The model 
allows extrapolation of results obtained from relatively short-term clinical 
trials to longer-term medical outcomes, and from trial populations to real-life 
populations providing a tangible yardstick to judge the quality of diabetes 
care. The model was used to evaluate diabetes care options in Germany, France, 
Switzerland, UK and US.
