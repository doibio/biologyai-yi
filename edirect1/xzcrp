OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) treatment in jerky 
and tremulous functional movement disorders (FMD).
METHODS: Patients with invalidating, chronic (>1 year) symptoms were randomly 
assigned to two subsequent treatments with BoNT or placebo every 3 months with 
stratification according to symptom localisation. Improvement on the 
dichotomised Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) (improvement 
vs no change or worsening) at 4 months, assessed by investigators blinded to the 
allocated treatment was the primary outcome. Subsequently all patients were 
treated with BoNT in a ten month open-label phase.
RESULTS: Between January 2011 and February 2015 a total of 239 patients were 
screened for eligibility of whom 48 patients were included. No difference was 
found on the primary outcome (BoNT 16 of 25 (64.0%) vs Placebo 13 of 23 patients 
(56.5%); proportional difference 0.075 (95% CI -0.189 to 0.327; p=0.77). 
Secondary outcomes (symptom severity, disease burden, disability, quality of 
life and psychiatric symptoms) showed no between-group differences. The 
open-label phase showed improvement on the CGI-I in 19/43 (44.2%) of remaining 
patients, with a total of 35/43 (81.4%) improvement compared with baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: In this double-blind randomised controlled trial of BoNT for 
chronic jerky and tremulous FMD, we found no evidence of improved outcomes 
compared with placebo. Motor symptoms improved in a large proportion in both 
groups which was sustained in the open-label phase. This study underlines the 
substantial potential of chronic jerky and tremulous FMD patients to recover and 
may stimulate further exploration of placebo-therapies in these patients.

OBJECTIVES: A number of publications have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of 
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF+RBV) compared with the former standard therapy 
with interferon (IFN)-containing regimens. Unlike these cost-effective analyses, 
where efficacy parameters were obtained from registration trials for drug 
approval, this analysis is a cost-effectiveness analysis of SOF+RBV for genotype 
(GT) 2 non-cirrhosis (NC) and compensated cirrhosis (CC) patients using efficacy 
parameters obtained from a multicentre cohort study (Kyushu University Liver 
Disease Study; KULDS) in Kyushu area in Japan in order to reflect real-world 
clinical practice in Japan.
METHOD: A Markov model followed 10 000 patients (62 years old) over their 
lifetime. Four populations were followed: treatment-naïve (TN)-NC, 
treatment-experienced (TE)-NC, TN-CC and TE-CC. Comparators were Peg-IFNα2b+RBV 
for TN-NC and CC patients and telaprevir (TVR)+Peg-IFNα2b+RBV for TE-NC 
patients. The sustained virological response (SVR) rates of SOF+RBV were taken 
from KULDS and those of comparators were obtained from systematic literature 
reviews. There were nine states (NC, CC, decompensated cirrhosis [DC], 
hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], SVR [NC], SVR [CC], liver transplantation [LT], 
post-LT and death) in this model, and an increase in the progression rate to HCC 
due to ageing was also considered. The analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of a public healthcare payer, and a discount rate of 2% was set for 
both cost and effectiveness.
RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of SOF+RBV versus 
Peg-IFNα2b+RBV were ¥323 928 /quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for TN-NC 
patients, ¥92 256/QALY for TN-CC patients and ¥1 519 202/QALY for TE-CC 
patients. The ICER of SOF+RBV versus TVR+Peg-IFNα2b+RBV was ¥849 138/QALY for 
TE-NC patients. The robustness of the results was determined by sensitivity 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis strongly demonstrate the robustness of 
our previous findings that SOF+RBV regimens are cost-effective in the real world 
and clinical trial settings for Japanese GT2 NC and CC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Australia's ageing population puts significant demands on the aged 
care and healthcare sectors. To monitor the provision of aged care and 
healthcare services to older people, each government body has an individual data 
collection system. Together these systems can be the basis for creating the 
evidence necessary to support future allocation of resources for our ageing 
community. The Registry of Older South Australians (ROSA) is a cross-sector 
multidisciplinary (ie, aged care and healthcare) platform built to address the 
challenges of monitoring people in aged care settings. This protocol describes 
the ROSA's framework and plans.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A registry to capture 16 000 South Australians/year 
undergoing an aged care eligibility assessment was designed. ROSA will contain 
information captured by the Commonwealth and South Australian state Health 
Authority, linked by two data integrating authorities, and housed on a secured 
data platform. ROSA will contain information on the sociodemographic, health, 
function, psychological, social, home and safety assessment and concerns 
characteristics, aged care services, general health services, and mortality of 
people receiving aged care services. Registered participants will be 
prospectively monitored until their death and yearly updates of their aged care 
and healthcare services information will be added to the registry.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: ROSA will longitudinally monitor the services provided 
to a population that puts costly demands on the state healthcare and aged care 
systems, identify unwanted variation, and underpin future research. ROSA's 
expected outputs include an annual report, a research agenda that focuses on 
high burden conditions and potentially economically impactful questions, 
educational materials, and risk profiling tools. ROSA was approved by the South 
Australian Department for Health and Ageing HREC (HREC/17/SAH/125) and the 
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare HREC (EO2018/2/429).

PURPOSE: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of cascade genetic testing in 
asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) compared 
with periodical clinical surveillance.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model, combining a decision tree and a Markov 
model, was used to determine the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for the two strategies. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were undertaken to assess the robustness of findings and to explore 
decision uncertainty.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per additional QALY of cascade genetic testing 
prior to periodical clinical surveillance of first-degree relatives compared 
with periodical clinical surveillance alone was estimated at approximately AUD 
$6100. At established thresholds of cost-effectiveness, there is a 90% 
probability that cascade genetic testing is cost-effective. Extensive 
sensitivity analyses, including the addition of second-degree relatives, did not 
alter the conclusions drawn from the main analysis.
CONCLUSION: Using cascade genetic testing to guide clinical surveillance of 
asymptomatic relatives of patients with DCM is very likely to be cost-effective. 
As the DCM pathogenic variant detection rate rises and new evidence for 
personalized treatment of at-risk individuals becomes available, the 
cost-effectiveness of cascade testing will further increase.

Global Updates on Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Trends and Attribution of 
Traditional Risk Factors.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The last 2-3 decades have witnessed a decline in 
age-standardized cardiovascular mortality rates in high-income regions, whereas 
this has only slightly decreased or even increased in most of the low- and 
middle-income countries. A systematic comparison of global CVD mortality by 
regions attributable to various modifiable risk factors such as diabetes, 
obesity, hypertension, poor diet, and physical inactivity is not available.
RECENT FINDINGS: We present a summary of time trends and heterogeneity in the 
distribution of global CVD mortality and the attribution of risk factors between 
1990 and 2017 using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Globally, an 
estimated ~ 17.8 million (233.1 per 100,000) people died of CVD in 2017. The 
rate of CVD death was decreased in high-income countries (1990: 271.8 (95% UI 
(uncertainty interval), 270.9-273.5); 2017: 128.5 (95% UI, 126.4-130.7) per 
100,000)) whereas it remained the same in lower- and middle-income countries 
(1990: 368.2 (95% UI, 335.6-383.3); 2017: 316.9 (95% UI, 307.0-325.5) per 
100,000). Among the various traditional risk factors, high systolic blood 
pressure, unhealthy diet, high fasting plasma glucose, and high low-density 
lipoprotein levels were attributed to most of the CVD death and 
disability-adjusted life year lost. We also observed gender variations in 
tobacco and increased alcohol consumption. In addition to the traditional risk 
factors, poor air quality is associated with increased CVD burden in developing 
countries. Surveillance, country-specific guidelines, evidence-based policies, 
reinforcement of multisectoral health systems, and innovative solutions are 
urgently needed in resource-challenged settings to curb CVD risk factors and 
overall burden.

Should I want to live to 100?

Pence GE(1).

Alabama.

Is it virtuous for someone to try to live to 100? Casting aside questions of 
intergenerational justice and internal obligations in families, what about the 
basic desire itself? Discussions of longevity and aging in bioethics are skewed 
to controversial end-of-life decisions, largely avoiding questions of how to age 
well before such decisions arise. Respected writers such as Atul Gawande, Daniel 
Callahan, and Ezekiel Emanuel champion accepting a natural life span and not 
trying to live beyond it. The Stoic Seneca says a desire to live to 100 is 
foolish because, however long people live, they waste most of their lives, so if 
they lived a thousand years, they would still waste most of it. Against Seneca 
and Emanuel, we argue that a functional, not a chronological, view of aging 
should guide us and that for some seniors, hoping to be centenarians may be 
neither foolish nor misguided. Using Cicero, we argue that the pleasures of 
seniors are not necessarily inferior to those of youth and may even surpass 
them. Finally, we agree with Emanuel that the "symptom burden" of some lives 
makes living to 100 unpalatable and with Seneca that, given life's vicissitudes, 
we should not plan on living to 100, but heeding his wisdom, try to make the 
most of the time given to us.

Exonuclease Ⅷ (Exo Ⅷ), an ATP-independent dsDNA 5'-3' exonuclease, is a 
candidate protein with great application value for in vitro DNA recombination. 
However, the application of Exo Ⅷ in DNA recombination in vitro has not been 
reported. In this study, the recombinant expression vector of the truncated Exo 
Ⅷ (tExo Ⅷ) with the full exonuclease activity was built and used to achieve the 
overexpression of tExo Ⅷ in Escherichia coli. Based on the purified tExo Ⅷ 
protein with high-purity, the feasibility of tExo Ⅷ applied in vitro DNA 
recombination and effects of the reaction temperatures, reaction duration, and 
homology arm lengths were examined. The results showed that tExo Ⅷ was highly 
expressed in soluble form in E. coli. One liter of bacterial culture yielded 
92.40 mg of purified tExo Ⅷ with the specific activity of 1.21×10⁵ U/mg. In a 10 
μL recombination system containing 2.5 U tExo Ⅷ, the highest cloning efficiency 
was achieved in a reaction at 25 °C for 12.5 min and followed by incubation at 
50 °C for 50 min. With addition of Pfu DNA polymerase, the homology arm 
extension strategy can effectively improve the recombination efficiency. Using 
competent E. coli Mach1 T1 with 2.2×10⁶ cfu/μg transformation efficiency as 
recipient cell, the recombination of a 1 kb fragment with a 21 bp homology arm 
and a 5.8 kb linearized vector can form about 1.1×10⁴ recombinant clones per μg 
vector, and the positive rates was over 80%. The recombination efficiency was 
increased with the increasing length of homology arm ranged from 8 to 21 bp. 
Under the optimal reaction condition, only 8 bp homology arm can still achieve 
valid DNA recombination. This novel in vitro DNA recombination system mediated 
by tExo Ⅷ was particularly characterized by its easy preparation, no limitation 
on restriction sites and high recombination cloning efficiency. All results 
revealed that the new efficient gene cloning system has potential application in 
the field of molecular biology.

Objective: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of previously used 
contraceptive methods on women's short- and long-term fecundity. Use of hormonal 
contraception (HC) was compared with the use of a contraceptive mobile 
application (app). Methods: This real-life prospective observational study 
comprised 2874 women who were attempting to become pregnant using the Natural 
Cycles mobile app to monitor their fertility. The women registered to use the 
app between August 2014 and June 2016 with the intention of planning a pregnancy 
and had previously either used the same app to prevent pregnancy or had recently 
discontinued HC use. We calculated the average time to pregnancy (TTP) for all 
women who became pregnant during the study and performed Kaplan-Meier life-table 
analysis to examine the cumulative probabilities of pregnancy for all women in 
the study. Results: The average TTP was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1, 
2.4) and 3.7 (95% CI 3.4, 3.9) cycles for women who had previously used Natural 
Cycles and HC, respectively. The time to reach 30% pregnancy probability for 
women previously on HC was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5, 1.8) times longer than for women 
previously using Natural Cycles. There was no significant difference in the 13 
cycle cumulated pregnancy probability between the two groups. Conclusion: The 
results show that fertility awareness-based methods of contraception increase 
short-term pregnancy rates relative to HC, but have no effect on long-term 
pregnancy rates.

Objective: The COMBI-AD trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib 
and trametinib in combination vs placebo as adjuvant treatment of patients with 
BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive resected Stage IIIA (lymph node metastasis 
>1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC melanoma. This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness 
of dabrafenib and trametinib vs observation from a US healthcare payer 
perspective.Methods: This evaluation employed a non-homogeneous, semi-Markov, 
cohort model with health states for relapse-free survival (RFS), 
post-locoregional recurrence (LR), post-distant recurrence (DR) receiving 
first-line treatment, and post-DR receiving second-line treatment. A 50-year 
modeling time horizon was used. Transition probabilities were estimated based on 
individual patient data (IPD) from the COMBI-AD trial. Health-state utilities 
were estimated using EuroQol (EQ-5D) index values from COMBI-AD and published 
sources. Direct medical costs associated with treatment of melanoma were 
considered, including costs of BRAF mutation testing, medication and 
administration costs for adjuvant and metastatic treatments, costs of treating 
recurrence, and costs of adverse events. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were discounted at 3.0% annually.Results: Compared with observation, 
adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib was estimated to result in a gain of 2.15 
QALYs at an incremental cost of $74,518. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was estimated to be $34,689 per QALY. In deterministic sensitivity 
analyses, the ICER was sensitive to the cost of dabrafenib and trametinib and 
the distribution used for projecting RFS beyond the end of follow-up in the 
COMBI-AD trial. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per QALY, the 
probability that dabrafenib and trametinib is cost-effective was estimated to be 
92%.Conclusions: Given generally-accepted cost-effectiveness threshold values in 
the US, dabrafenib plus trametinib is likely to be a cost-effective adjuvant 
therapy for patients with BRAF mutation positive melanoma. These results may be 
useful for policy-makers in their deliberations regarding reimbursement and 
access to this treatment.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed among men malignant 
disease that remains poorly characterized at the molecular level. Advanced PCa 
is not curable, and the current treatment methods can only increase the life 
expectancy by several months. Identification of the genetic aberrations in tumor 
cells provides clues to understanding the mechanisms of PCa pathogenesis and the 
basis for developing new therapeutic approaches. Here we present data on somatic 
mutations, namely single nucleotide variations (SNVs), small insertions and 
deletions, detected in prostate tumor tissue obtained from Russian patients with 
PCa. Moreover, we provide a raw dataset on the whole exome and targeted DNA 
sequencing of tumor and non-tumor prostate tissue obtained from Russian patients 
with PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This data is available at NCBI 
Sequence Read Archive under Accession No. PRJNA506922.

BRCA gene mutations are found in up to 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases. 
We present a description of 4 cases along with a review of the current 
literature regarding pathogenesis, target treatment, response and survival rates 
in these types of malignancies. We describe four cases of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, in three of which the BRCA2 mutation was identified, in one - 
BRCA1 gene alteration. Two patients underwent surgery following the neoadjuvant 
treatment with Folfirinox and radiotherapy; in the first case, a distal 
pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed and in the second one - the 
Whipple's procedure. In both cases, a complete pathological response was 
reported. Other 2 patients were treated with Folfirinox after BRCA mutation 
identification and acceptable life expectancy was obtained. The association of 
pathologic complete response (PCR) with lower rates of local recurrence and 
better survival in patients with various types of adenocarcinomas is well known. 
Identification of such patients carrying BRCA mutations could provide an 
application of better personalized treatment. In some patients with pancreatic 
cancer, especially when there is clinical or demographic reason to suspect a 
genetic predisposition, a confirmation of the presence of BRCA mutations could 
provide an opportunity to use target treatment with beneficial outcomes 
regarding survival.

AIM: To describe how generic preference-based health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) instruments have been used in research involving children with 
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD).
METHOD: A systematic search of nine databases identified studies that used 
generic preference-based HRQoL instruments in children with NDD. Data extracted 
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Review guidelines included type of NDD, instrument used, 
respondent type, justification, and critical appraisal for these selections.
RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were identified: four cost-utility analyses; 15 
HRQoL assessments; five economic burden studies; three intervention studies; and 
nine 'other'. The Health Utilities Index (Mark 2 and Mark 3) and EuroQoL 5D 
(EQ-5D; three-level EQ-5D, five-level EQ-5D, and the youth version of the EQ-5D) 
instruments were most frequently used (44% and 31% respectively). The relatively 
low use of these instruments overall may be due to a lack of psychometric 
evidence, inconsistency in justification for and lack of clarity on appropriate 
respondent type and age, and geographical challenges in applying preference 
weights.
INTERPRETATION: This study highlights the dearth of studies using generic 
preference-based HRQoL instruments in children with NDD. The use of cost-utility 
analysis in this field is limited and validation of these instruments for 
children with NDD is needed. The quality of data should be considered before 
guiding policy and care decisions.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Limited use of generic preference-based health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) instruments in studies on children with 
neurodevelopmental disorders. Only 11% of studies were cost-utility analyses. 
Inconsistencies in justification for choosing generic preference-based HRQoL 
instruments and respondent types.

Tracking progress in mean longevity: The Lagged Cohort Life Expectancy (LCLE) 
approach.

Cohort life expectancy is an important but rarely used indicator of mean 
longevity. In this paper, we show that there are specific advantages in lagging 
this indicator in time by its own value, an approach termed Lagged Cohort Life 
Expectancy (LCLE). We discuss the usefulness of LCLE as an indicator for 
tracking progress in mean longevity and introduce a new interpretation of LCLE 
as a reference age separating 'early' deaths from 'late' deaths, or, 
equivalently, as the age above which individuals in a population can be 
considered 'above-average' survivors. Using data from 15 countries in the Human 
Mortality Database, we show that current LCLE can be estimated with a relatively 
high degree of certainty, at least in these low-mortality populations. Results 
shed new light on levels and trends in mean longevity in these populations.

BACKGROUND: Rigor mortis occurs when muscle extension vanishes through the 
irresistible coupling of actin and myosin by the consumption of adenosine 
triphosphate as energy. To clarify the cause of the differences in the 
progression of rigor mortis, seven fish species were used as samples. The 
superprecipitation reaction and Mg2+ -ATPase activity of actomyosin in dorsal 
ordinary muscle were measured, and the slope of the regression line between 
these two variables was calculated for each fish specimen. The fiber types of 
the dorsal ordinary muscle in each sample fish were discriminated by the 
stability of actomyosin ATPase at acid and alkaline preincubations.
RESULT: Positive correlations were found between Mg2+ -ATPase activity and the 
superprecipitation reaction of actomyosin in all 27 fish specimens. The slopes 
of the regression lines were different not only between fish species but also in 
fish specimens within the same species. The area ratios of pink muscle fibers 
and the IIa and/or IIb subtypes of white muscle fibers in the dorsal ordinary 
muscle were also different between fish species, as well as in specimens within 
the same fish species. A positive correlation was found between the area ratios 
of pink muscle fibers in dorsal ordinary muscle and the slopes of the regression 
line.
CONCLUSION: It was suggested that the differences in characteristics of 
rigor-mortis-related actomyosin of fish might have been caused by the 
differences in the interposition ratio of muscle fiber types, especially of the 
pink muscle fiber type, in the dorsal ordinary muscle. © 2019 Society of

BACKGROUND: The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial demonstrated that 
tranexamic acid administered during postpartum hemorrhage reduces 
hemorrhage-related mortality and laparotomies. The World Health Organization has 
thus recommended early use of tranexamic acid in the treatment of postpartum 
hemorrhage. This recommendation has not been universally adopted in the United 
States, in part because of concerns about cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of routine tranexamic 
acid administration in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in the United 
States, where the rate of hemorrhage-related mortality is lower than that 
described in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial.
STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision tree comparing 3 strategies in women 
with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage: no tranexamic acid, 
tranexamic acid given at any time, and ideal use of tranexamic acid given within 
3 hours of delivery. The study was performed from a health care institution 
perspective with a time horizon of delivery until 6 weeks postpartum. We 
included interventions that differed by arm in the World Maternal 
Antifibrinolytic trial (hemorrhage-related mortality, laparotomies, and brace or 
compression sutures) and incorporated probabilities and costs based on available 
data for a population of women with postpartum hemorrhage in the United States. 
In our base case, the rate of postpartum hemorrhage-related mortality was 
0.0388%, and the cost of tranexamic acid was $37.80. We assumed that the 
relative risk reduction in death and laparotomy with tranexamic acid would be 
similar to the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial (19% and 36%, 
respectively). The primary outcome was incremental cost per hemorrhage-related 
death averted, and a main secondary outcome was incremental cost per laparotomy 
avoided under each strategy. Another planned secondary outcome was cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year. We anticipated that the risk reduction (benefit) 
because of tranexamic acid in the United States may be less than in the World 
Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial; thus, we performed 1-way and 2-way sensitivity 
analyses to explore the parameter uncertainty across a wide range of 
data-supported estimates. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo 
simulation were performed.
RESULTS: Tranexamic acid strategies were dominant (more effective and cost 
saving) compared with no tranexamic acid for patients with postpartum hemorrhage 
in the United States. One-way analyses showed that tranexamic acid is cost 
saving as long as the relative risk reduction of death with tranexamic acid is 
greater than 4.7%; the model was not sensitive to any other variables. Threshold 
analyses outside the bounds defined in the model showed that tranexamic acid is 
cost saving as long as the relative risk reduction of laparotomy with tranexamic 
acid is greater than 7% or the cost of tranexamic acid is less than $194. A 
2-way sensitivity analysis of the risk reduction of death because of tranexamic 
acid and the baseline risk of postpartum hemorrhage-related death confirmed that 
tranexamic acid is cost saving across a wide range of plausible estimates. 
Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the tranexamic 
acid strategies are cost saving in >99.9% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. 
Despite the initial cost of administration, the annual net cost savings expected 
from routine use of tranexamic acid for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage 
in the United States is $11.3 million, and we estimate that 9 maternal deaths 
would be averted in 1 year with this strategy. Giving tranexamic acid within 3 
hours would almost triple the cost savings and improve maternal outcomes 
much further.
CONCLUSION: A policy of routine tranexamic acid early in the treatment of 
postpartum hemorrhage is likely to be cost saving in the United States. This 
conclusion holds true even when the relative risk reduction with tranexamic acid 
is significantly less than reported in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial 
and when tranexamic acid is significantly more expensive than currently 
reported.

Occipital and external acoustic meatus to axis angle: a useful predictor of 
oropharyngeal space in rheumatoid arthritis patients with atlantoaxial 
subluxation.

OBJECTIVE: Dyspnea and/or dysphagia is a life-threatening complication after 
occipitocervical fusion. The occiput-C2 angle (O-C2a) is useful for preventing 
dyspnea and/or dysphagia because O-C2a affects the oropharyngeal space. However, 
O-C2a is unreliable in atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) because it does not 
reflect the translational motion of the cranium to C2, another factor affecting 
oropharyngeal area in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have reducible 
AAS. The authors previously proposed the occipital and external acoustic meatus 
to axis angle (O-EAa; i.e., the angle made by McGregor's line and a line joining 
the external auditory canal and the middle point of the endplate of the axis [EA 
line]) as a novel, useful, and powerful predictor of the anterior-posterior 
narrowest oropharyngeal airway space (nPAS) distance in healthy subjects. The 
aim of the present study was to elucidate the validity of O-EAa as an indicator 
of oropharyngeal airway space in RA patients with AAS.
METHODS: The authors investigated 64 patients with RA. The authors collected 
lateral cervical radiographs at neutral position, flexion, extension, 
protrusion, and retraction and measured the O-C2a, C2-C6, O-EAa, anterior 
atlantodental interval (AADI), and nPAS. Patients were classified into 2 groups 
according to the presence of AAS and its mobility: group N, patients without 
AAS; and group R, patients with reducible AAS during dynamic cervical movement.
RESULTS: Group N had a significantly lower AADI and O-EAa than group R in all 
but the extension position. The O-EAa was a better predictor for nPAS than O-C2a 
according to the mixed-effects models in both groups (marginal R2: 0.510 and 
0.575 for the O-C2a and O-EAa models in group N, and 0.250 and 0.390 for the 
same models, respectively, in group R).
CONCLUSIONS: O-EAa was superior to O-C2a in predicting nPAS, especially in the 
case of AAS, because it affects both O-C2a and cranial translational motion. 
O-EAa would be a useful parameter for surgeons performing occipitocervical 
fusion in patients with AAS.

Background. Older adults with limited life expectancy frequently receive cancer 
screening, although on average, harms outweigh benefits. We examined the 
influence of life expectancy on older adults' cancer screening decisions 
relative to three other factors. Methods. Adults aged 65+ years (N = 1272) were 
recruited from a national online survey panel. Using a discrete choice 
experiment, we systematically varied a hypothetical patient's life expectancy, 
age, quality of life, and physician's recommendation and asked whether the 
participant would choose screening. Participants were randomized to questions 
about colonoscopy or prostate-specific antigen/mammography screenings. Logistic 
regression produced preference weights that quantified the relative influence of 
the 4 factors on screening decisions. Results. 879 older adults completed the 
survey, 660 of whom varied their screening choices in response to the 4 factors 
we tested. The age of the hypothetical patient had the largest influence on 
choosing screening: the effect of age being 65 versus 85 years had a preference 
weight of 2.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.22, 2.65). Life expectancy (10 
versus 1 year) had the second largest influence (preference weight: 1.64, CI: 
1.41, 1.87). Physician recommendation (screen versus do not screen) and quality 
of life (good versus poor) were less influential, with preference weights of 
0.90 (CI: 0.72, 1.08) and 0.68 (CI: 0.52, 0.83), respectively. Conclusions. 
While clinical practice guidelines increasingly use life expectancy in addition 
to age to guide screening decisions, we find that age is the most influential 
factor, independent of life expectancy, quality of life, and physician 
recommendation, in older adults' cancer screening choices. Strategies to reduce 
overscreening should consider the importance patients give to continuing 
screening at younger ages, even when life expectancy is limited.

BACKGROUND: There is limited research on the economic burden of low back-related 
leg pain, including sciatica. The aim of this study was to describe healthcare 
resource utilisation and factors associated with cost and health outcomes in 
primary care patients consulting with symptoms of low back-related leg pain 
including sciatica.
METHODS: This study is a prospective cohort of 609 adults visiting their family 
doctor with low back-related leg pain, with or without sciatica in a United 
Kingdom (UK) Setting. Participants completed questionnaires, underwent clinical 
assessments, received an MRI scan, and were followed-up for 12-months. The 
economic analysis outcome was the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculated 
from the EQ-5D-3 L data obtained at baseline, 4 and 12-months. Costs were 
measured based on patient self-reported information on resource use due to 
back-related leg pain and results are presented from a UK National Health 
Service (NHS) and Societal perspective. Factors associated with costs and 
outcomes were obtained using a generalised linear model.
RESULTS: Base-case results showed improved health outcomes over 12-months for 
the whole cohort and slightly higher QALYs for patients in the sciatica group. 
NHS resource use was highest for physiotherapy and GP visits, and work-related 
productivity loss highest from a societal perspective. The sciatica group was 
associated with significantly higher work-related productivity costs. Cost was 
significantly associated with factors such as self-rated general health and care 
received as part of the study, while quality of life was significantly predicted 
by self-rated general health, and pain intensity, depression, and disability 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to understanding the economics of low back- 
related leg pain and sciatica and may provide guidance for future actions on 
cost reduction and health care improvement strategies.
