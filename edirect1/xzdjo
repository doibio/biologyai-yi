plant families, was identified in the nectar of sainfoin (Onobrychis 
viciifolia), a component of UK AES and a major global crop. We showed that 
caffeine significantly reduces N. bombi infection intensity, both 
prophylactically and therapeutically, in individual bumblebees (Bombus 
terrestris), and, for the first time, that such effects impact social 
epidemiology, with colonies reared from wild-caught queens having both lower 
prevalence and intensity of infection. Furthermore, infection prevalence was 
lower in foraging bumblebees from caffeine-treated colonies, suggesting a likely 
reduction in population-level transmission. Combined, these results show that N. 
bombi is less likely to be transmitted intracolonially when bumblebees consume 
naturally available caffeine, and that this may in turn reduce environmental 
prevalence. Consequently, our results demonstrate that floral phytochemicals at 
ecologically relevant concentrations can impact pollinator disease epidemiology 
and that planting strategies that increase floral abundance to support 
biodiversity could be co-opted as disease management tools.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Non muscle invasive, high-risk, bladder cancer is an 
entity which is usually treated with radical cystectomy. Incidental prostate 
cancer refers to prostate cancer detected in radical cystectomy specimens in 
patients with no signs of the disease. Objective of this study is to report the 
prevalence, characteristics, and clinical significance of incidental prostate 
cancer in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients treated with radical 
cystectomy in our department.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 41 patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy for non-muscle invasive, high risk, bladder cancer 
during the years 2016-2020 in our department. Prostate cancer was described as 
clinically significant when there were positive surgical margins, extraprostatic 
extension, Gleason score >6, or tumor volume ⩾0.5 cm3. Two groups of patients 
were formed according to the presence or absence of clinically significant 
prostate cancer.
RESULTS: Incidental prostate cancer in the cystectomy specimens was detected in 
21 of the 35 patients investigated. Clinically significant prostate cancer was 
detected in five patients. Positive surgical margins and extraprostatic 
extension were present in one patient, respectively. Gleason score was more than 
six in four of the five patients and PCa tumor volume was above 0.5 cm3 in three 
patients. Two patients with clinically significant prostate cancer were 
diagnosed with biochemical recurrence during their follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: In non-muscle invasive, high-risk patients undergoing radical 
cystectomy, clinically significant incidental PCa is an important issue as it 
may affect prognosis, quality of life, metastasis free survival, and overall 
survival.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a major health concern. Understanding the 
different burden and tendency of MM in different regions is crucial for 
formulating specific local strategies. Therefore, we evaluated the epidemiologic 
patterns and explored the risk factors for MM death.
METHODS: Data on MM were collected from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study. 
We used incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life-years to estimate the 
global, regional, and national burden of MM.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 155,688 (95% UI, 136,585 - 172,577) MM cases 
worldwide, of which 84,516 (54.3%, 70,924 - 94,910) were of men. The 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) was 1.72/100,000 persons (95% UI, 
1.59-1.93) in 1990 and 1.92/100,000 persons (95% UI, 1.68-2.12) in 2019. The 
number of MM deaths increased 1.19-fold from 51,862 (95% UI, 47,710-58,979) in 
1990 to 113,474 (95% UI, 99,527 - 121,735) in 2019; the age-standardized death 
rate (ASDR) was 1.42/100,000 persons (95% UI, 1.24-1.52) in 2019. In recent 
15 years, ASDR showed a steady tendency for men, and a downward tendency for 
women. Countries with high social-demographic indexes exhibited a higher ASIR 
and ASDR. Australasia, North America, and Western Europe had the highest ASIR 
and ASDR, with 46.3% incident cases and 41.8% death cases. Monaco had the 
highest ASIR and ASDR, which was almost half as high as the second highest 
country Barbados. In addition, United Arab Emirates and Qatar had the largest 
growth multiple in ASIR and ASDR, which was twice the third country Djibouti.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, incident and death MM cases have more than doubled over 
the past 30 years. The increasing global burden may continue with population 
aging, whereas mortality may continue to decrease with the progression of 
medical technology. The global burden pattern of MM was diverse, therefore 
specific local strategies based on different burden patterns for MM are 
necessary.

BACKGROUND: Hip geometry influences hip fracture risk. Hip fractures are common, 
and they are associated with pain, disability, premature death and marked costs 
on society. Osteoporotic fractures are frequent in Arctic populations and 
increase with advancing age in this society with a steep rise in life 
expectancy. Greenland Inuit is a distinct ethnic group, and data on hip geometry 
is missing. We thus aimed to describe hip geometry in 7.7 years of consecutive 
hip fracture patients in Greenland.
METHODS: We evaluated collodiaphysial angle, femoral neck length, the outer and 
inner diameter of the femur at 2 and 5 centimetres below the centre of the 
lesser trochanter and the cortical thickness from pelvic and hip radiographs in 
all patients operated in Greenland over 7.7 years. We included all 84 patients 
with one non-fractured hip visible for geometric analysis. Analyses were 
conducted in duplicate.
RESULTS: We found a collodiaphysial angle of 134.8/132.6o in men/women (p = 
0.06) and a femoral neck length of 38.0/33.9 mm in men/women (p = 0.001). 
Cortical thickness was affected by sex in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.001). 
Cortical thickness index at 5 cm below the centre of the lesser trochanter 
decreased with age (p = 0.026) and may be influenced by height (2 cm below the 
centre of the lesser trochanter, p = 0.053).
CONCLUSION: Our findings differed from European data and suggest a delicate 
balance in hip geometry in Arctic populations. Ethnic peculiarities influence 
the structure of the hip and may influence fracture risk. A focus on hip 
geometry and risk factors for osteoporotic fractures in Arctic populations is 
warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether robot-assisted training is cost-effective 
compared with an enhanced upper limb therapy (EULT) programme or usual care.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation within a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Four National Health Service (NHS) centres in the UK: Queen's Hospital, 
Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust; Northwick Park 
Hospital, London Northwest Healthcare NHS Trust; Queen Elizabeth University 
Hospital, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; and North Tyneside General Hospital, 
Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
PARTICIPANTS: 770 participants aged 18 years or older with moderate or severe 
upper limb functional limitation from first-ever stroke.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomised to one of three programmes provided over 
a 12-week period: robot-assisted training plus usual care; the EULT programme 
plus usual care or usual care.
MAIN ECONOMIC OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean healthcare resource use; costs to the NHS 
and personal social services in 2018 pounds; utility scores based on EQ-5D-5L 
responses and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness reported 
as incremental cost per QALY and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: At 6 months, on average usual care was the least costly option (£3785) 
followed by EULT (£4451) with robot-assisted training being the most costly 
(£5387). The mean difference in total costs between the usual care and 
robot-assisted training groups (£1601) was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Mean QALYs were highest for the EULT group (0.23) but no evidence of a 
difference (p=0.995) was observed between the robot-assisted training (0.21) and 
usual care groups (0.21). The incremental cost per QALY at 6 months for 
participants randomised to EULT compared with usual care was £74 100. 
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that robot-assisted training was 
unlikely to be cost-effective and that EULT had a 19% chance of being 
cost-effective at the £20 000 willingness to pay (WTP) threshold. Usual care was 
most likely to be cost-effective at all the WTP values considered in the 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that neither 
robot-assisted training nor EULT, as delivered in this trial, were likely to be 
cost-effective at any of the cost per QALY thresholds considered.

Tyne, UK.

OBJECTIVES: A clear understanding of whether increases in longevity are spent in 
good health is necessary to support ageing, health and care-related policy.
DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review to update and summarise evidence on 
trends in health expectancies, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) high-income countries.
DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, 1946-19 September 2019; Embase 
1980-2019 week 38; Scopus 1966-22 September 2019, Health Management Information 
Consortium, 1979-September 2019), and the UK Office for National Statistics 
website (November 2019).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: English language studies published from 2016 that reported 
trends in healthy, active and/or disability-free life expectancy in an OECD 
high-income country.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Records were screened independently by two 
researchers. Study quality was assessed using published criteria designed to 
identify sources of bias in studies reporting trends, and evidence summarised by 
narrative synthesis.
FINDINGS: Twenty-eight publications from 11 countries were included, covering 
periods from 6 to 40 years, between 1970 and 2017. In most countries, gains in 
healthy and disability-free life expectancy do not match the growth in total 
life expectancy. Exceptions were demonstrated for women in Sweden, where there 
were greater gains in disability-free years than life expectancy. Gains in 
healthy and disability-free life expectancy were greater for men than women in 
most countries except the USA (age 85), Japan (birth), Korea (age 65) and Sweden 
(age 77).
CONCLUSION: An expansion of disability in later life is evident in a number of 
high-income countries, with implications for the sustainability of health and 
care systems. The recent COVID-19 pandemic may also impact health expectancies 
in the longer term.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited genetic conditions associated 
with lifelong complications and increased healthcare resource utilization. 
Standard treatment for SCD in the US varies based on stage of the disease and 
observed clinical severity. In this study, we aim to evaluate the potential 
cost-effectiveness of a durable cell or gene therapy cure for sickle cell 
disease from the US healthcare sector perspective. We developed a lifetime 
Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical 
single-administration durable treatment (DT) for SCD provided at birth, relative 
to standard of care (SOC). We informed model inputs including direct healthcare 
costs, health state utility weights, transition probabilities, and mortality 
rates using a retrospective database analysis of commercially insured 
individuals and the medical literature. Our primary outcome of interest was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DT versus SOC evaluated at a base 
case willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY). We tested the robustness of our base case findings through 
scenario, deterministic sensitivity (DSA), and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSA). In the base case analysis, treatment with DT was cost-effective 
with an ICER of $140,877/QALY relative to SOC for a hypothetical cohort 
involving 47% females. Both males (ICER of $135,574/QALY) and females (ICER of 
$146,511/QALY) were similarly cost-effective to treat. In univariate DSA the 
base case ICER was most sensitive to the costs of treating males, DT treatment 
cost, and the discount rate. In PSA, DT was cost-effective in 32.7%, 66.0%, and 
92.6% of 10,000 simulations at WTP values of $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000 
per QALY, respectively. A scenario analysis showed cost-effectiveness of DT is 
highly contingent on assumed lifetime durability of the cure. A hypothetical 
cell or gene therapy cure for SCD is likely to be cost-effective from the US 
healthcare sector perspective. Large upfront costs of a single administration 
cure are offset by significant downstream gains in health for patients treated 
early in life. We find cost-effectiveness outcomes do not vary substantially by 
gender; however, several model parameters including assumed durability and 
upfront cost of DT are likely to influence cost-effectiveness findings.

Combined measurements of mRNA and protein expression in single cells enable 
in-depth analysis of cellular states. We present SPARC, an approach that 
combines single-cell RNA-sequencing with proximity extension essays to 
simultaneously measure global mRNA and 89 intracellular proteins in individual 
cells. We show that mRNA expression fails to accurately reflect protein 
abundance at the time of measurement, although the direction of changes is in 
agreement during neuronal differentiation. Moreover, protein levels of 
transcription factors better predict their downstream effects than do their 
corresponding transcripts. Finally, we highlight that protein expression 
variation is overall lower than mRNA variation, but relative protein variation 
does not reflect the mRNA level. Our results demonstrate that mRNA and protein 
measurements in single cells provide different and complementary information 
regarding cell states. SPARC presents a state-of-the-art co-profiling method 
that overcomes current limitations in throughput and protein localization, 
including removing the need for cell fixation.

Medical Sciences, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kochi, Kerala, India.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is one of the critical risk factors for 
lifestyle-related diseases. In Kerala, the life expectancy of doctors who are 
considered the gatekeepers of health was found to be 13 years lower than the 
general population.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify the motivators and barriers for 
physical activity among doctors and nurses belonging to public and private 
health-care sectors in Ernakulam district.
METHODOLOGY: Qualitative study was conducted using a grounded theory approach. A 
total of 30 in-depth interviews and 8 focus group discussions were conducted 
among doctors and nurses, respectively. The audio-recorded data were 
transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed.
RESULTS: The main themes identified were motivators, barriers, and future 
considerations for physical activity. The factors motivating doctors were the 
fear of noncommunicable diseases and to stay fit, while the nurses were more 
concerned about their body image. The common barriers were gender, lack of time, 
laziness, bad climate, and safety issues. Overreliance on medication and 
prioritizing their patients' health over their own were additional barriers.
CONCLUSION: Physical activity among doctors and nurses is severely compromised. 
Provision of a favorable environment and behavior change is needed to combat the 
silent epidemic of physical inactivity.

Tailoring Therapy for Achalasia.

Richter JE(1).

Author information:
(1)Dr Richter is a professor of medicine, Hugh F. Culverhouse Chair for 
Esophageal Disorders, director of the Division of Digestive Diseases and 
Nutrition, and director of the Joy McCann Culverhouse Center for Esophageal and 
Swallowing Disorders at the University of South Florida Morsani College of 
Medicine in Tampa, Florida.

Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder with impaired lower esophageal 
sphincter (LES) opening and aperistalsis. The disease cannot be cured and 
aperistalsis cannot be corrected, but good long-term symptom relief results from 
some degree of destruction to the obstruction of the LES. The presence of 
multiple treatment options with excellent scientific efficacy now offers the 
opportunity to tailor therapy for patients with achalasia. Drug therapy, 
especially botulinum toxin A, should be reserved for elderly patients with short 
life expectancy. Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are equally effective 
for patients with types I and II achalasia. Pneumatic dilation offers a less 
morbid, cheaper outpatient procedure, especially for older patients and women, 
but redilation may be needed. Surgical myotomy is effective across all groups, 
especially young men. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with fundoplication is 
preferred in patients with megaesophagus, diverticulum, or hiatal hernia. 
Peroral endoscopic myotomy is the treatment of choice for patients with type III 
achalasia, but requires advanced endoscopic skills, and the risk of 
gastroesophageal reflux disease is high. This article reviews the various 
treatments currently available for achalasia and discusses how to tailor therapy 
for patients.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a 3-year mortality rate up to 
37%, 2-6 times higher than the general population. We present evidence 
supporting pharmacological therapies to improve patient life expectancy, 
focusing on inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) combined with long-acting 
bronchodilators (LABDs). A reduction in 3-year all-cause mortality (ACM) has 
been shown in patients with severe COPD treated with fluticasone propionate (an 
ICS) and salmeterol [long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)], compared with placebo. An 
observational study of elderly patients with severe COPD and multiple 
comorbidities suggested ICS+LABD reduce ACM compared with LABD monotherapy. 
Patients with symptomatic COPD at risk of exacerbations saw a mortality benefit 
with the ICS/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/LABA combinations 
fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) or 
budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol (BUD/GLY/FOR) versus UMEC/VI or GLY/FOR 
(LAMA/LABA combinations) in the IMPACT and ETHOS trials, respectively. Reduced 
risk of mortality may be due to modulation of airway inflammation, thereby 
reducing activation of proinflammatory mediators in the peripheral circulation. 
Importantly, estimated annual risk reduction for ACM with ICS/LAMA/LABA 
combinations in patients with COPD is of the same order of magnitude as for 
statins (patients with coronary disease) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (patients with vascular disease). Based on the current data, the 
pharmacological treatment of COPD appears not only able to improve symptoms and 
reduce the frequency of exacerbations but is also very promising in improving 
patient prognosis in the long term.

BACKGROUND: Vascular dysfunction and associated disorders are major side effects 
of chronic bed rest, yet passive mobilization as a potential treatment has only 
been theorized so far. This study investigated the effects of passive 
mobilization treatment on vascular function in older, chronically bedridden 
people.
METHOD: The study sample was 45 chronically bedridden people of advanced age 
(mean age: 87 years; 56% female; mean bed rest: 4 years) randomly assigned to a 
treatment (n = 23) or a control group (CTRL, n = 22). The treatment group 
received passive mobilization twice daily (30 minutes, 5 times/wk) for 4 weeks. 
A kinesiologist performed passive mobilization by passive knee flexion/extension 
at 1 Hz in one leg (treated leg [T-leg] vs control leg [Ctrl-leg]). The CTRL 
group received routine treatment. The primary outcome was changes in peak blood 
flow (∆peak) as measured with the single passive leg movement test at the common 
femoral artery.
RESULTS: ∆Peak was increased in both legs in the Treatment group (+90.9 mL/min, 
p < .001, in T-leg and +25.7 mL/min, p = .039 in Ctrl-leg). No difference in 
peak blood flow after routine treatment was found in the CTRL group.
CONCLUSION: Improvement in vascular function after 4 weeks of passive 
mobilization was recorded in the treatment group. Passive mobilization may be 
advantageously included in standard clinical practice as an effective strategy 
to treat vascular dysfunction in persons with severely limited mobility.

IMPORTANCE: In the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart 
Failure (DAPA-HF) trial, dapagliflozin was shown to reduce cardiovascular 
mortality and hospitalizations due to heart failure while improving 
patient-reported health status. However, the cost-effectiveness of adding 
dapagliflozin therapy to standard of care (SOC) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin therapy among 
patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This Markov cohort cost-effectiveness model 
used estimates of therapy effectiveness, transition probabilities, and utilities 
from the DAPA-HF trial and other published literature. Costs were derived from 
published sources. Patients with HFrEF included subgroups based on diabetes 
status and health status impairment due to heart failure. We compiled parameters 
from the literature including DAPA-HF, on which our model is based, and many 
other sources from December 2019 to February 27, 2021. We performed our analysis 
in February 2021.
EXPOSURES: Dapagliflozin or SOC.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations for heart failure, life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the cost per QALY gained 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio).
RESULTS: In the model, dapagliflozin therapy yielded a mean of 0.78 additional 
life-years and 0.46 additional QALYs compared with SOC at an incremental cost of 
$38 212, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of $83 650. The cost per QALY was 
similar for patients with or without diabetes and for patients with mild or 
moderate impairment of health status due to heart failure. The 
cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to estimates of the effect on mortality 
and duration of therapy effectiveness. If the cost of dapagliflozin decreased 
from $474 to $270 (43% decline), the cost per QALY gained would drop below 
$50 000.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that dapagliflozin provides 
intermediate value compared with SOC, based on American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association benchmarks. Additional data regarding the 
magnitude of mortality reduction would improve the precision of 
cost-effectiveness estimates.

Dementia in advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a fatal milestone resulting in 
reduced life expectancy and nursing home placement. Cognitive impairment and 
cardiovascular dysautonomia are common and debilitating non-motor symptoms that 
frequently coexist in PD since the early stages and progress in subsequent 
years. In particular, blood pressure (BP) abnormalities, including orthostatic 
hypotension (OH), supine hypertension (SH) and the loss of nocturnal BP fall 
(non-dipping) in PD have been associated with cognitive deterioration. They 
usually have multifactorial aetiology, including neuronal (central and 
peripheral) mechanisms and concomitant intake of medications. BP abnormalities 
can influence cognition in many ways, including repeated cerebral hypoperfusion 
leading to cerebral ischaemic lesions, higher burden of white matter 
hyperintensities, and possible impact on neurodegenerative process in PD. They 
are often asymptomatic and remain unrecognised, hence 24-hour ambulatory BP 
monitoring is recommended in patients with clinical symptoms of dysautonomia. 
Management is challenging and should address the multifactorial nature of BP 
disturbances. The aim of this review was to present the state of current 
knowledge regarding the possible relationship between cardiovascular 
dysautonomia and cognition in PD, its diagnosis and treatment.

Glioblastoma remains among the most lethal of human malignancies. The current 
standard of care prolongs life expectancy about 2 months on average compared to 
from radiation therapy alone, leading to a median patient survival of 14.6 
months. Glioblastoma is heterogenous tumor at various levels, and intrinsically 
resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. These limits therapeutic options for 
both primary and recurrent tumors. Importantly, glioblastoma progression is 
often accompanied by cerebral edema, a significant cause of morbidity that 
influences the clinical course and prognosis of the disease. Immunosuppressive 
corticosteroids have been the primary treatment for glioblastoma-associated 
edema. However, the effect is temporary and accompanied by adverse effects due 
to the action of corticosteroids outside of the targeted area. Research over the 
past two decades has unveiled a significant role for metabolic reprogramming 
that confers a survival advantage during gliomagenesis and therapeutic 
resistance. This chapter introduces the recent discoveries of two energy 
metabolism pathways: AMP-activated kinase-mediated stress-resilient glioblastoma 
growth, and Guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP)- metabolic reprogramming that 
renders anabolic growth and radioresistance. We discuss the potential clinical 
utility of currently available medicine that could target these metabolic 
pathways to suppress malignant growth of glioblastoma and increase the efficacy 
of the current glioblastoma therapy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the process of clinical diagnosis and treatment, 
the restricted mean survival time (RMST), which reflects the life expectancy of 
patients up to a specified time, can be used as an appropriate outcome measure. 
However, the RMST only calculates the mean survival time of patients within a 
period of time after the start of follow-up and may not accurately portray the 
change in a patient's life expectancy over time.
METHODS: The life expectancy can be adjusted for the time the patient has 
already survived and defined as the conditional restricted mean survival time 
(cRMST). A dynamic RMST model based on the cRMST can be established by 
incorporating time-dependent covariates and covariates with time-varying 
effects. We analyzed data from a study of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) to 
illustrate the use of the dynamic RMST model, and a simulation study was 
designed to test the advantages of the proposed approach. The predictive 
performance was evaluated using the C-index and the prediction error.
RESULTS: Considering both the example results and the simulation results, the 
proposed dynamic RMST model, which can explore the dynamic effects of prognostic 
factors on survival time, has better predictive performance than the RMST model. 
Three PBC patient examples were used to illustrate how the predicted cRMST 
changed at different prediction times during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the dynamic RMST model based on the cRMST allows for the 
optimization of evidence-based decision-making by updating personalized dynamic 
life expectancy for patients.

internal exposure for radiation workers.

For compliance with dose limits, the International Commission on Radiological 
Protection (ICRP) recommends that the committed dose be assigned to the year in 
which radionuclide intake occurred in the case of internal exposure. For 
radiation workers, the committed dose is evaluated over the 50 year period 
following the intake, which is a rounded value for the working-life expectancy 
of a young person entering the workforce. In this study, we develop an approach 
to the quantitative evaluation of the conservatism in the concept of the 
committed dose from internal exposure for radiation workers from the viewpoint 
of radiological risk. Actual annual doses due to an intake of radionuclides for 
strontium-90 (90Sr), caesium-137 (137Cs), and plutonium-239 (239Pu) were 
simulated. Risks of fatal cancer, i.e. unconditional death probability rates, 
were calculated in accordance with the risk estimation method in ICRP 
Publication 60. It was found that the conservatism ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 
for90Sr, 1.0 to 1.6 for137Cs, and 1.6 to 2.2 for239Pu. The importance of 
understanding the extent of this conservatism and the uncertainty for practical 
radiological protection are also discussed.

OBJECTIVE: The results of recent studies have shown that using low-dose computed 
tomography (LDCT) for screening of lung cancer (LC) improves cancer outcomes. 
The objective of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
LDCT in an Iranian high-risk population.
METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation model with four health states was used to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT from a healthcare system perspective in 
the people aged 55-74 who smoked 25 or more cigarettes per day for 10-30 years. 
Cost data were collected, reviewing 324 medical records of patients with LC, and 
utilities and transition probabilities were extracted from the literature. The 
Monte Carlo simulation method was applied to run the model. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and one-way analysis were also performed.
RESULTS: LC screening in comparison to a no-screening strategy was costly and 
effective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of screening versus 
no-screening was IRR (Iranian rials) 98,515,014.04 which falls below the Iranian 
threshold of three times GDP (gross domestic product) per capita. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results of the economic 
analysis were robust to variations in the key inputs for both.
CONCLUSIONS: Using LDCT for screening of LC patients in a high-risk population 
is a cost-effective strategy.

Orthopedic Manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis.

Lambrechts MJ, Smith MJ, Choma TJ.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a relatively common disease seen in Whites of northern 
European descent. Classically, it was a lethal disease and uncommon for the 
orthopedic practitioner to interact with CF patients. Recent pharmaceutical 
breakthroughs targeting the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene 
have significantly prolonged patient life expectancy. This makes it increasingly 
likely that orthopedic surgeons will encounter CF patients in their clinic. In 
this article, the authors discuss pertinent musculoskeletal manifestations of 
the CF population, including the increased risk of decreased bone mineral 
density and bone mineral content, muscle deconditioning, spinal kyphosis, 
fractures, and elevated systemic inflammation predisposing these individuals to 
CF-related arthralgia. The diagnoses are grouped into subspecialties 
(arthroplasty, pediatrics, spine, sports, and trauma) most likely to evaluate 
the patient. Additionally, the authors review treatment options for these 
conditions and discuss the need for these patients to be seen in the 
perioperative period by their CF care team for patient optimization due to their 
diminished pulmonary function. Interspersed with this literature review, the 
authors present 2 unique cases. The first case details a patient with pain over 
her spine due to multilevel spinous process bursitis caused by a high-frequency 
chest wall oscillation system, which masquerades as an infection. The second 
case is a non-contact midsubstance rectus femoris tear in an athlete. These 
cases highlight the need for increased vigilance for uncommon diagnoses in the 
CF patient population. [Orthopedics. 2021;44(3):e440-e445.].
