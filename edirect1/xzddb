PREEMPT 1 and 2 studies, and three open-label studies, namely the Chronic 
Migraine OnabotulinuMtoxinA Prolonged Efficacy open Label (COMPEL), the 
REal-life use of botulinum toxin for the symptomatic treatment of adults with 
chronic migraine, measuring healthcare resource utilization, and 
Patient-reported OutcomeS observed in practice (REPOSE) studies, and the CM 
Post-Authorization Safety Study (CM PASS) studies. On the other hand, the 
results were challenged by the Chronification and Reversibility of Migraine 
(CHARM) study, which involved CM patients with medication overuse. It was 
concluded that the clinical improvement was attributed to early withdrawal of 
the overused acute medications, rather than onabotulinumtoxinA injections. 
However, fundamental differences in the patient profile and methodology between 
the CHARM and PREEMPT studies existed, and cautious should be exercised when 
interpreting and comparing the results. According to the practical guidelines 
and reimbursement regulations in many countries, its use is limited to CM 
patients, and is reserved for those who fail at least 2-3 preventive 
medications, due to either lack of efficacy or intolerability. Cessation of 
treatment is recommended in patients who do not respond to 2-3 injection cycles, 
or in patients whose headache frequency has dropped to <10-15 days a month. Even 
in the era of calcitonin-gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies, 
onabotulinumtoxinA injection remains a treatment option of reasonable 
cost-effectiveness in carefully selected patients.

Psychotic disorders are associated with premature mortality, but research was 
primarily based on Western countries and rarely examined non-affective psychoses 
other than schizophrenia (ONAP). This population-based cohort study investigated 
excess mortality in 46 896 schizophrenia and 20 651 ONAP patients between 
January 2006 and December 2016 in Hong Kong (HK), by estimating all-cause and 
cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and life-years lost (LYLs), 
a recently developed, more precise reduced life expectancy measure taking into 
account the illness onset (age at first-recorded diagnosis). Changes in 
mortality metrics over the study period were assessed. Study data were retrieved 
from a territory-wide medical-record database of public healthcare services to 
7.5 million HK residents. Results showed that schizophrenia and ONAP patients 
had higher all-cause (schizophrenia: SMR: 2.49 [95% CI: 2.43-2.55]; ONAP: 2.00 
[1.92-2.09]), natural-cause (1.80 [1.74-1.85]; 1.47 [1.40-1.54]), and 
unnatural-cause (6.97 [6.47-7.49]; 8.53 [7.61-9.52]) mortality rates than 
general population. Respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers 
accounted for the majority of deaths in patient cohorts. Men and women with 
schizophrenia had 9.53 years and 8.07 years of excess LYLs, respectively. For 
ONAP, excess LYLs was 8.18 years for men and 5.44 years for women. The overall 
mortality gap remained similar for both patient groups over time despite their 
improved longevity and declined unnatural-cause mortality rates. Taken together, 
schizophrenia and ONAP are associated with increased premature mortality and 
substantially reduced lifespan in a predominantly Chinese population, with 
excess deaths mainly attributed to a natural cause. Persistent mortality gap 
highlights an urgent need for targeted interventions to improve the physical 
health of patients with psychotic disorders.

The change in life expectancy affects the clinical presentation and the 
prognosis of elderly patients with gynecological cancer. The in-crease of life 
expectancy and increased numbers of elderly patients, the healthcare systems 
have to deal more frequently with patients who are not simply older adults but 
have also severe comorbidities and physiological, psychological, functional, and 
social needs that require individualised management. Discussing every individual 
after detailed assessment in a multidisciplinary meeting is extremely important. 
Several studies have shown that elderly patients with gynecological malignancies 
are not treated to the same extent as young-er patients and have lower odds of 
receiving standard care according to the oncological protocols. 
Individualization of management in these patients could be identified in several 
studies in the literature showing that increasing age at diagnosis predicts 
deviation from guidelines for surgical therapy, adjuvant radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy. The authors performed a literature review to clarify whether there 
are any changes in the treatment of such patients, and whether their management 
should be considered to be individualized, depending on their age and 
comorbidities.

In 2016, alcohol consumption was one of the leading risk factors for cancer 
development and cancer death globally, causing an estimated 376 200 cancer 
deaths, representing 4.2% of all cancer deaths, and 10.3 million cancer 
disability-adjusted life years lost, representing 4.2% of all cancer 
disability-adjusted life years lost. The impact of alcohol consumption on cancer 
in 2016 varied by age group; the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to 
alcohol consumption ranged from 13.9% of cancer deaths among people aged 30-34 
years to 2.7% of cancer deaths among people aged 80-84 years. The burden of 
cancers caused by alcohol consumption might be decreased through (i) 
individual-level and societal-level interventions that reduce alcohol 
consumption, and (ii) measures that target those risk factors that interact with 
alcohol consumption to increase the risk of cancer or that directly affect the 
risk of alcohol-related cancers.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most expensive 
gastroenterological conditions and is an ideal target for developing a 
value-based care model. We assessed the comparative cost-benefit of treatments 
for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), the most common IBS subtype from insurer and 
patient perspectives.
METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model assessing trade-offs among 
guideline-recommended and recently FDA-approved drugs, supplements, low FODMAP 
diet, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Outcomes and costs were derived from 
systematic reviews of clinical trials and national databases. Health-gains were 
represented using quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
RESULTS: From an insurer perspective, on-label prescription drugs (rifaximin, 
eluxadoline, alosetron) were significantly more expensive than off-label 
treatments, low FODMAP, or CBT. Insurer treatment preferences were driven by 
average wholesale prescription drug prices and were not affected by health gains 
in sensitivity analysis within standard willingness-to-pay ranges up to 
$150,000/QALY-gained. From a patient perspective, prescription drug therapies 
and neuromodulators appeared preferable due to a reduction in lost wages due to 
IBS with effective therapy, and also considering out-of-pocket costs of low 
FODMAP food and out-of-pocket costs to attend CBT appointments. Comparative 
health outcomes exerted influence on treatment preferences from a patient 
perspective in cost-benefit analysis depending on a patients' willingness-to-pay 
threshold for additional health-gains, but health outcomes were less important 
than out-of-pocket costs at lower willingness-to-pay thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Costs are critical determinants of IBS treatment value to patients 
and insurers, but different costs drive patient and insurer treatment 
preferences. Divergent cost drivers appear to explain misalignment between 
patient and insurer IBS treatment preferences in practice.

The present work describes the feasibility of coffee residue extracts as 
cryoprotective agents in the storage stability of freeze-dried lactic acid 
bacteria. Coffee residue extracts were extracted from coffee residue, produced 
after coffee extraction for coffee powder and instant coffee preparation, using 
an autoclave. Leuconostoc mesenteroides WiKim32 was selected to evaluate the 
ability of coffee residue extracts to protect bacteria during freeze-dried 
storage. The storage stability of freeze-dried Leu. mesenteroides WiKim32 with 
coffee residue extracts was comparable to those with commercial cryoprotective 
agents. Coffee residue extracts contributed to storage stability immediately 
after freeze-drying (61.2%) and subsequent storage (48.7%). Our data indicate 
that the protective effect of the coffee residue extracts is associated with 
ions, carbohydrates, and phenolic compounds. Coffee residue extracts are 
feasible materials, which can reduce the storage and distribution costs compared 
to commercial agents currently available.

Healthy aging is a process that occurs over the life cycle. Health habits 
established early and practiced throughout life impact longevity, the ability to 
reach old age, and the health with which one experiences older adulthood. The 
new field of lifestyle medicine addresses root causes of disease by targeting 
nutrition, physical activity, well-being, stress management, substance use, 
connectedness, and sleep. As a result, lifestyle medicine can optimize the 
trajectory of aging, and promote targets that have been recognized in geriatric 
medicine as essential to well-being and quality of life, resulting in a 
compression of morbidity.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, COPD is a leading cause of mortality, with a 
substantial societal health and economic burden. With anticipated population 
growth, it is important for various stakeholders to have an estimate for the 
projected burden of disease.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to model the 20-year health and 
economic burden of COPD, from 2019 to 2038, in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using country-specific data from published literature 
and publicly available datasets, a dynamic open cohort Markov model was 
developed in a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation. Population growth was 
modeled across different subgroups of age, sex, and smoking. The COPD prevalence 
rates were calibrated for different subgroups, and distributions of severity 
grades were modeled based on smoking status. Direct costs, indirect absenteeism 
costs, losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and number of 
exacerbations and deaths associated with COPD were projected.
RESULTS: The 20-year discounted direct medical costs attributable to COPD were 
estimated to be $800.90 billion (95% credible interval [CrI], 565.29 
billion-1,081.29 billion), with an expected $337.13 billion in male subjects and 
$463.77 billion in female subjects. The 20-year discounted indirect absenteeism 
costs were projected to be $101.30 billion (70.82 billion-137.41 billion). The 
20-year losses of QALYs, number of exacerbations, and number of deaths 
associated with COPD were 45.38 million (8.63 million-112.07 million), 315.08 
million (228.59 million-425.33 million), and 9.42 million (8.93 million-9.93 
million), respectively. The proportion of disease burden attributable to 
continued smoking was 34% in direct medical costs, 35% in indirect absenteeism 
costs, and 37% in losses of QALYs over 20 years.
INTERPRETATION: This study projects the substantial burden of COPD that the 
American society is expected to incur with current patterns for treatments and 
smoking rates. Mitigating such burden requires targeted budget appropriations 
and cost-effective interventions.

Hypertension can cause significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Most 
patients with hypertension have primary hypertension; however, 10 to 15% of 
patients have secondary hypertension. Endocrine disorders explain approximately 
10% of hypertension in all patients, and thyroid disorders account for 
approximately 1% of cases with hypertension. Hyperthyroidism can cause increased 
cardiac output, increased systolic blood pressures, and increased levels of 
renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone. Treatment of hyperthyroidism can cure 
hypertension in some patients. Consequently, identification of patients with 
secondary hypertension potentially has important benefits, and understanding 
secondary hypertension provides a framework for investigating the 
pathophysiology of hypertension. Clinicians should consider the possibility of 
hyperthyroidism in patients with hypertension, even in those of more advanced 
age.

INTRODUCTION: Since the life expectancy of women with breast cancer has 
increased, tertiary prevention, through the Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE), 
is now a part of patient support. The main objective of this pilot study is to 
evaluate the cost of a nutrition and physical activity TPE program intended to 
help women with breast cancer in the management of their weight.
METHODS: This study is a description of costs, based on the micro-costing 
method, of the first two years of the program, conducted on an outpatient basis, 
at the Cancer Center Leon Berard, Lyon, France, with the involvement of a 
dietician and a physical activity trainer. Only the direct costs were taken into 
account, from the hospital's perspective, in Euro 2016. Sensitivity analyses 
were also conducted.
RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included in the study in 2014/2015. Their mean 
age was 52 years, the majority of them were in sick leave (65 %). In most cases, 
they had undergone surgery (95 %) and chemotherapy (71 %). The average cost per 
patient of the program was 541.04€ (SD 88.44€; 95 % IC [520.06-562.03]) 
excluding overhead costs, i.e. 687.13€ overhead costs included. The unit cost of 
the dietician was the most sensitive parameters.
CONCLUSION: This cost study, an accurate estimate of the production costs, 
allows to inform the decision-maker in term of pricing of such a program and to 
make the necessary adjustments in order to optimize the organization of this 
activity.

BACKGROUND: Current literature suggests that brain metastasis is an infrequent 
occurrence in metastatic colorectal cancer. Outside of rare autopsy studies, 
these retrospective reports describe the incidence of symptomatic brain 
metastasis and therefore lack a description of the incidence in asymptomatic 
patients. With improved survival and a lack of routine brain imaging, the true 
incidence of brain metastasis among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
is likely under-recognized. At our research institution, protocol criteria 
require brain imaging regardless of neurologic symptoms. Therefore, we aim to 
describe the incidence of asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer enrolled onto a clinical trial screening protocol at the National Cancer 
Institute that underwent brain imaging (n = 171) between 2010 and 2019.
RESULTS: The median age of patients at initial colorectal cancer diagnosis was 
48.1 years. Most had stage IV disease with synchronous metastases. Twenty-five 
(14.6%) patients were identified with brain metastases, of which 19 (76%) were 
asymptomatic. Those with asymptomatic lesions were more likely to have presented 
with synchronous metastases, have a shorter time from primary diagnosis to 
development of metastatic disease, and have smaller brain metastases.
CONCLUSION: We identified a high number of asymptomatic brain metastasis and 
subsequently a higher cumulative incidence of brain metastases in patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer than historical reports would suggest. This may 
represent a heretofore unknown aspect of the natural course of disease now being 
exposed owing to an increasing life expectancy of these patients and could play 
a pivotal role in therapeutic decisions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac 
arrhythmia, typically increases with age. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are the 
cornerstone of treatment to reduce the associated risk for systemic 
thromboembolism. Four large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that 
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are non-inferior to vitamin 
K antagonists (VKAs) in preventing stroke and systemic embolism, as well as 
regarding their risk for major bleeding. However, as vulnerable geriatric 
patients with AF were largely underrepresented in these trials, physicians are 
faced with the challenge of choosing the right anticoagulant for geriatric 
patients in real-life clinical practice. In this vulnerable patient group, NOACs 
tend to be underused or underdosed due to concerns of excessive fall-related 
intracranial bleeding, cognitive impairment, multiple drug-drug interactions, 
low body weight or impaired renal function. As life expectancy continues to rise 
worldwide, the number of geriatric patients substantially increases. Therefore, 
there is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the added value of NOACs in 
geriatric patients with AF at high thromboembolic and bleeding risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This systematic review provides an overview of the 
literature on the impact of increased age (≥75 years), multimorbidity, 
polypharmacy, increased falling risk, frailty and dementia on the effectiveness 
and safety of NOACs as compared to VKAs, after searching the Medline database. 
Moreover, a meta-analysis on the impact of increased age ≥75 years old was 
performed after pooling results from 6 post hoc analyses of RCTs and 6 
longitudinal observational cohort studies, highlighting the superior 
effectiveness (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.74-0.94] 
for stroke/SE; HR 0.77, 95%CI [0.65-0.92] for mortality) and non-inferior safety 
(HR 0.93, 95%CI [0.86-1.01] for major bleeding; HR 0.58, 95%CI [0.50-0.67] for 
intracranial bleeding; HR 1.17, 95%CI [0.99-1.38] for gastrointestinal bleeding) 
of NOACs versus VKAs in older AF patients.
CONCLUSION: Across geriatric subgroups, apixaban was consistently associated 
with the most favourable benefit-risk profile and should therefore be preferred 
in geriatric patients with AF. However, research gaps on the impact of increased 
falling risk, frailty and baseline dementia were identified, requiring careful 
consideration while awaiting more results.

Gerontology, Beijing, China.

Aging is a common risk factor for the occurrence and development of many 
diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, 
hypertension, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, and cancer, among 
others, and is a key problem threatening the health and life expectancy of the 
elderly. Oxidative damage is an important mechanism involved in aging. The 
latest discovery pertaining to oxidative damage is that 8-oxoGsn 
(8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine), an oxidative damage product of RNA, can represent 
the level of oxidative stress. The significance of RNA oxidative damage to aging 
has not been fully explained, but the relationship between the accumulation of 
8-oxoGsn, a marker of RNA oxidative damage, and the occurrence of diseases has 
been confirmed in many aging-related diseases. Studying the aging mechanism, 
monitoring the aging level of the body and exploring the corresponding 
countermeasures are of great significance for achieving healthy aging and 
promoting public health and social development. This article reviews the 
progress of research on 8-oxoGsn in aging-related diseases.

Furandioate-adipate copolyesters are an emerging class of bio-based 
biodegradable polymers with great potential to replace fossil-derived 
terephthalic acid-based copolyesters such as poly(butylene 
adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT). Furandioate-adipate polyesters have almost 
exclusively been prepared with conventional primary (1°) alcohol diols, while 
secondary (2°) alcohol diol monomers have largely been overlooked until now, 
despite preliminary observations that using methyl-branched diols increases the 
T g of the resultant polyesters. Little is known of what impact the use of 2° 
alcohol diols has on other properties such as material strength, hydrophobicity, 
and rate of enzymatic hydrolysis-all key parameters for performance and 
end-of-life. To ascertain the effects of using 2° diols on the properties of 
furandioate-adipate copolyesters, a series of polymers from diethyl adipate 
(DEA) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (FDEE) using different 1° and 
2° alcohol diols was prepared. Longer transesterification times and greater 
excesses of diol (diol/diester molar ratio of 2:1) were found to be necessary to 
achieve M ws > 20 kDa using 2° alcohol diols. All copolyesters from 2° diols 
were entirely amorphous and exhibited higher T gs than their linear equivalents 
from 1° diols. Compared to linear 
poly(1,4-butyleneadipate-co-1,4-butylenefurandioate), methyl-branched, 
poly(2,5-hexamethyleneadipate-co-2,5-hexamethylenefurandioate) (0:7:0.3 
furandioate/adipate ratio) displayed both higher modulus (67.8 vs 19.1 MPa) and 
higher extension at break (89.7 vs 44.5 mm). All other methyl-branched 
copolyesters displayed lower modulus but retained higher extension at break 
compared with their linear analogues. Enzymatic hydrolysis studies using 
Humicola insolens cutinase revealed that copolyesters from 2° alcohol diols have 
significantly decreased rates of biodegradation than their linear equivalents 
synthesized using 1° alcohol diols, allowing for fine-tuning of polymer 
stability. Hydrophobicity, as revealed by water contact angles, was also found 
to generally increase through the introduction of methyl branching, 
demonstrating potential for these materials in coatings applications.

Chronic care is an important area for cost-effective and efficient health 
service delivery. Matching demand and services for chronic care is not easy as 
patients may have different needs in different stages of the disease. More 
insight is needed into the complete patient journey to do justice to the 
services required in each stage of the disease, to the different experiences of 
patients in each part of the journey, and to outcomes in each stage. With 
patient journey we refer to the "journey" of the patient along the services 
received within a demand segment of chronic care. We developed a generic 
framework for describing patient journeys and provider networks, based on an 
extension of the well-known model of Donabedian, to relate demand, services, 
resources, behavior, and outcomes. We also developed a generic operational model 
for the detailed modeling of services and resources, allowing for insight into 
costs. The generic operational model can be tailored to the specific 
characteristics of patient groups. We applied this modeling approach to type 2 
diabetes (T2D) patients. Diabetes care is a form of chronic care for patients 
suffering diabetes mellitus. We studied the performance of T2D networks, using a 
descriptive model template. To identify and describe demand we made use of the 
following demand segments within the diabetes type 2 population: patients 
targeted for prevention; patients with stage 1 diabetes treated by their GP with 
lifestyle advice; patients with diabetes stage 2 treated by their GP with 
lifestyle advice and oral medication; patients with stage 3 diabetes treated by 
their GP with lifestyle advice, oral medication, and insulin injections; 
patients with stage 4 diabetes with complications (treated by internal medicine 
specialists). We used a Markov model to describe the transitions between the 
different health states. The model enables the patient journey through the 
health care system for cohorts of newly diagnosed T2D patients to be described, 
and to make a projection of the resource requirements of the different demand 
segments over the years. We illustrate our approach with a case study on a T2D 
care network in The Netherlands and reflect on the role of demand segmentation 
to analyse the case study results, with the objective of improving the T2D 
service delivery.

BACKGROUND: There are limited estimates of the incidence rates (IRs) of 
mastocytosis, and only a few studies have addressed the long-term consequences 
of living with these diagnoses. Previous reports have shown that systemic 
mastocytosis is associated with leukemic transformations and an increased risk 
of death as opposed to cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and indolent systemic 
mastocytosis (ISM), which have benign diagnoses with life expectancy rates 
similar to those of the background population.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the incidence and mortality of 
mastocytosis.
METHODS: A population-based matched cohort study of patients with mastocytosis 
between 1 January 1, 1977 and 31 December 31, 2014 was identified from the 
Danish National Health Registries. IRs of CM, ISM, and pediatric mastocytosis 
were highlighted. Survival estimates were compared with those of a healthy 
background population, using a Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: A total of 1461 patients with mastocytosis were identified. The annual 
IR of overall mastocytosis was 1.1 per 100,000 person years (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.0-1.2). Among children, the IR was 1.8 per 100,000 person years 
(95% CI, 1.6-2.1). The prevalence of any comorbidity was twice as high among 
patients with mastocytosis compared with the population without mastocytosis 
(odds ratio: 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8-2.5). The Charlson Comorbidity Index-adjusted 
mortality among adult patients with mastocytosis was HRCutaneous Mastocytosis 
1.2 (95% CI, 0.8-1.9), HRIndolent Systemic Mastocytosis 1.9 (95% CI 1.4-2.5), 
and HRSystemic Mastocytosis 4.2 (95%, CI 1.9-9.4), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Based on an entire nation, with free health care at the point of 
access, we estimated an annual IR of mastocytosis and its subgroups. We 
discovered that patients with ISM had an increased risk of death compared with 
the general population. Our data supported the overall benign nature of CM 
diagnosed after age 2 years.

The compound optimization monitor (COMO) approach was originally developed as a 
diagnostic approach to aid in evaluating development stages of analog series and 
progress made during lead optimization. COMO uses virtual analog populations for 
the assessment of chemical saturation of analog series and has been further 
developed to bridge between optimization diagnostics and compound design. 
Herein, we discuss key methodological features of COMO in its scientific context 
and present a deep learning extension of COMO for generative molecular design, 
leading to the introduction of DeepCOMO. Applications on exemplary analog series 
are reported to illustrate the entire DeepCOMO repertoire, ranging from chemical 
saturation and structure-activity relationship progression diagnostics to the 
evaluation of different analog design strategies and prioritization of virtual 
candidates for optimization efforts, taking into account the development stage 
of individual analog series.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cost-utility of universal Hepatitis B vaccination 
program in the Beijing city (Beijing).
METHODS: A decision-Markov model was constructed to determine the cost-utility 
of the universal immunization program for infants (universal vaccination 
program) by comparing with a hypothetic nonvaccination strategy in Beijing. 
Parameters in models were extracted from Beijing Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) annual work report, Beijing health statistical yearbook, 
National Health Survey report, Beijing 1% population sample survey report, 
Beijing Health and Medical Price Monitoring Data Platform, and public 
literatures. The incremental cost‑utility ratio (ICUR) was used to compare 
alternative scenarios. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were used to assess parameter uncertainties.
RESULTS: The universal vaccination program had increased the utility and reduced 
cost among infants born in 2016 in Beijing. The ICUR was CNY -24,576.61 (US$ 
-3779.16) per QALY for universal vaccination program comparing with 
non-vaccination scenario from healthcare perspective. It was estimated that the 
universal vaccination would save direct medical treatment cost of CNY 
2,262,869,173.50 (US$ 347,962,414.43) and prevent loss of 18322.25 QALYs within 
lifetime of target cohort. Discount rate accounted for the most remarkable 
influence on ICUR in one-way sensitivity analysis. The result of probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis illustrated that all of the ICURs were located in the 
fourth quadrant of the cost-utility incremental plot undergone 5000 times of 
Monte Carlo simulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Current universal hepatitis B vaccination program in Beijing was 
highly cost utility. The investment was reasonable for current universal 
vaccination program in Beijing.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the burden and risk factors for 
ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 
2017.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 were 
used. Prevalence, incidence, deaths, years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
years of life lost (YLLs) were metrics used to measure IHD burden. Population 
attributable fraction was used to estimate the proportion of IHD deaths 
attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. Globally, in 2017, 126.5 
million [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 118.6 to 134.7] people lived with IHD and 
10.6 million (95% UI 9.6 to 11.8) new IHD cases occurred, resulting in 8.9 
million (95% UI 8.8 to 9.1) deaths, 5.3 million (95% UI 3.7 to 7.2) YLDs, and 
165.0 million (95% UI 162.2 to 168.6) YLLs. Between 1990 and 2017, despite the 
decrease in age-standardized rates, the global numbers of these burden metrics 
of IHD have significantly increased. The burden of IHD in 2017 and its temporal 
trends from 1990 to 2017 varied widely by geographic location. Among all 
potentially modifiable risk factors, age-standardized IHD deaths worldwide were 
primarily attributable to dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, high LDL 
cholesterol, high fasting plasma glucose, tobacco use, and high body mass index 
in 2017.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that IHD remains a major public health 
challenge worldwide. More effective and targeted strategies aimed at 
implementing cost-effective interventions and addressing modifiable risk factors 
are urgently needed, particularly in geographies with high or increasing burden.

Patients suffering from psychiatric disorders have an excess mortality and a 
shorter life span expectancy compared to the general population. Furthermore, 
they are treated with multiple drugs and are known to have an increased risk of 
drug abuse. In this study, we aimed at investigating the pharmaceutical drug and 
drug of abuse profiles of the deceased included in the Danish prospective 
autopsy-based forensic study on psychiatric patients, SURVIVE. Using the 
postmortem systematic toxicological analysis results, we identified 129 
different consumed compounds in our population (n = 443). Polypharmacy (≥5 
compounds) was detected in 39.5% of the deceased. Deceased with a psychiatric 
diagnosis or who died from a fatal intoxication had significantly more compounds 
at the time of their death compared to having either no psychiatric diagnosis or 
another cause of death, respectively. Evidence of drug abuse was present, as 
29.8% of our total population had consumed either methadone or illicit drugs of 
abuse, excluding tetrahydrocannabinol. Of those deceased with a psychiatric 
diagnosis, 33.6% had either consumed methadone or illicit drugs of abuse, a 
greater number than those without a psychiatric diagnosis. Fatal intoxication 
was the most frequent cause of death (40.6%) with methadone as the major 
intoxicant. Here, we found that those without a psychiatric diagnosis had fewer 
fatal pharmaceutical drug intoxications compared to the psychiatric diagnosis 
groups. Our findings add further context to understanding the excess mortality 
of psychiatric patents, since there is an increased occurrence of fatal 
intoxication, polypharmacy, and drug abuse in this population.

OBJECTIVES: Quantify the burden of central nervous system (CNS) metastases on 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and healthcare resource use (HRU) in 
patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a prospective 
European study in clinical practice, utilising clinical trial inclusion 
criteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients ≥18 years, with metastatic NSCLC, Eastern 
Oncology C0operative Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 and life expectancy ≥12 
weeks were enrolled in two cohorts by baseline CNS metastases status. 
Demographics, clinical characteristics, NSCLC management data, HRQoL and HRU 
were collected at baseline and two follow-up visits (Visits 2 and 3, 6 weeks 
apart). HRQoL was assessed using validated questionnaires.
RESULTS: 162 patients were enrolled (n = 80 CNS cohort, n = 82 non-CNS cohort). 
Baseline characteristics were balanced, but CNS patients were younger 
(mean ± standard deviation age: 62.1 ± 9.6 vs 65.6 ± 9.7 years, p =  0.021) with 
a lower body mass index (13.8 % underweight [<18.5kg/m2] vs 3.7 %, p =  0.049). 
Mean HRQoL scores were similar between cohorts at all visits. Cancer 
pharmacotherapy, procedures and concomitant treatment were comparable across 
cohorts, with some exceptions. More CNS patients were hospitalised at baseline 
(10.3 % vs 2.2 %) for longer (mean 7.2 vs 4.6 days; p <  0.001). By Visit 2, 
more CNS patients were hospitalised (50.0 % vs 29.3 %; p = 0.009) with emergency 
room visits (11.8 % vs 2.7 %; p =  0.032). At baseline, more CNS versus non-CNS
