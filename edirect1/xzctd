PURPOSE: Randomized data assessing the longitudinal quality of life (QoL) impact 
of stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) in the oligometastatic setting 
are lacking.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We enrolled patients who had a controlled primary 
malignancy with 1 to 5 metastatic lesions, with good performance status and life 
expectancy >6 months. We randomized in a 1:2 ratio between standard of care 
(SOC) treatment (SOC arm) and SOC plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR 
arm). QoL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-General. QoL changes over time and between groups were assessed with 
linear mixed modeling.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients were randomized. Median age was 68 years (range, 
43-89), and 60% were male. The most common primary tumor types were breast (n = 
18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18), and prostate (n = 16). Most patients (n 
= 92) had 1 to 3 metastases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Because of the 
previously reported inferior survival of the SOC arm, the time for attrition in 
QoL respondents to <10% of subjects was shorter in the SOC versus SABR arm (30 
vs 42 months). In the whole cohort, QoL declined over time after randomization: 
There were significant declines in total Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-General score over time compared with baseline (P < .001) owing to 
declines in physical and functional subscales (both P < .001), with no declines 
in social and emotional subscales. However, the magnitudes of decline were 
small, and clinically meaningful changes were not seen at most time points. 
Comparison between arms showed no differences in QoL between the SABR and SOC 
arms in total score (P = .42) or in the physical (P = .98), functional (P = 
.59), emotional (P = .82), or social (P = .17) subscales.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with oligometastases, average QoL declines slowly over 
time regardless of treatment approach, although the changes are small in 
magnitude. The use of SABR, compared with SOC, was not associated with a QoL 
detriment.

Ascertaining the causes of adaptive radiation is central to understanding how 
new species arise and come to vary with their resources. The ecological theory 
posits adaptive radiation via divergent natural selection associated with novel 
resource use; an alternative suggests character displacement following 
speciation in allopatry and then secondary contact of reproductively isolated 
but ecologically similar species. Discriminating between hypotheses, therefore, 
requires the establishment of a key role for ecological diversification in 
initiating speciation versus a secondary role in facilitating co-existence. 
Here, we characterize patterns of genetic variation and postzygotic reproductive 
isolation for tephritid fruit flies in the Rhagoletis cingulata sibling species 
group to assess the significance of ecology, geography, and non-adaptive 
processes for their divergence. Our results support the ecological theory: no 
evidence for intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation was found between two 
populations of allopatric species, while nuclear-encoded microsatellites implied 
strong ecologically based reproductive isolation among sympatric species 
infesting different host plants. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggested, 
however, that cytoplasmic-related reproductive isolation may also exist between 
two geographically isolated populations within R cingulata. Thus, ecology 
associated with sympatric host shifts and cytoplasmic effects possibly 
associated with an endosymbiont may be the key initial drivers of the radiation 
of the R. cingulata group.

OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold standard to prevent a 
recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, in the 
modern era, the benefit of CEA in asymptomatic octogenarian patients has come 
into question. This study investigates real-world outcomes of CEA in 
asymptomatic octogenarians.
METHODS: Patients who underwent CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis were 
identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program CEA-targeted database from 2012 to 2017. They were 
stratified into two groups: octogenarians (≥80 years old) and younger patients 
(<80 years old). The 30-day outcomes evaluated included mortality and major 
morbidities such as stroke, cardiac events, pulmonary, and renal dysfunction. 
Multivariable logistic regression was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 13,846 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who 
underwent an elective CEA including 2509 octogenarians and 11,337 younger 
patients. Octogenarians were more likely to be female and less likely to be 
diabetic or smokers compared with younger patients. There was no difference in 
preoperative use of statins or antiplatelet therapy. Examination of 30-day 
outcomes revealed that octogenarians had slightly higher mortality (1.2% vs 
0.5%; odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.4; P < .01), and a higher 
risk of return to the operating room (3.3% vs 2.3%; odds ratio, 1.4; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.1-1.9; P = .01). However, there was no difference between 
octogenarians and younger patients in adverse cardiac events or pulmonary, 
renal, or wound complications. Twenty-five octogenarian and 138 younger patients 
suffered from periprocedural stroke at a similar rate (1.0% vs 1.2%; P = .54). 
Stroke/death occurred for 51 of 2509 patients (2.0%) in the older group and 184 
of 11,337 patients (1.6%) in the younger group, a difference that was not 
significant (P = .15).
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day outcomes of CEA in octogenarians are comparable with 
those in younger patients. Although the octogenarians had slightly higher 
mortality than younger patients, the absolute risk of mortality was still low at 
1.2%. Therefore, CEA is safe in asymptomatic carotid stenosis in octogenarians. 
Overall life expectancy and preoperative functional status, rather than age, 
should be the major determinants in the decision to operate.

Pyricularia oryzae (synonym Magnaporthe oryzae) is a plant pathogen causing 
major yield losses in cultivated rice and wheat. The P-type ATPases play 
important roles in cellular processes of fungi, plants, and animals via 
transporting specific substrates through ATP hydrolysis. Here, we characterized 
the roles of a P5-ATPase, Spf1, in the development and virulence of P. oryzae. 
Deletion of SPF1 led to decreased hyphal growth and conidiation, delayed spore 
germination and appressorium formation, reduced penetration and invasive hyphal 
extension, and attenuated virulence. Appressorium turgor, however, was not 
affected by deletion of SPF1. The co-localization of Spf1-GFP and an endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) marker protein, Lhs1-DsRed2, indicated that Spf1 is an 
ER-localized P5-ATPase. An ER stress factor, 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (TUNI), 
inhibited the growth of ∆spf1, but another ER stress factor, 5 mM dithiothreitol 
(DTT), promoted the growth of ∆spf1. Treatment with chemicals for oxidative 
stress (5 mM H2O2 and 0.8 mM paraquat) also promoted the growth of ∆spf1. Gene 
expression assays showed that unfolded protein response (UPR) components KAR2, 
OST1, PMT1, ERV29, PDI1, SCJ1, SEC61, a Ca2+ channel-related P-type ATPase gene 
PMR1, and a calcineurin-dependent transcription factor CRZ1 were significantly 
up-regulated in ∆spf1, suggesting activation of UPR in the mutant. These lines 
of experimental evidence indicate that SPF1 is involved in some basal ER 
mechanisms of P. oryzae including UPR pathway and responses to ER related 
stresses, therefore, affecting fungal development and virulence. However, the 
detailed mechanism between Spf1 and virulence still awaits future researches.

Raine syndrome is a rare hereditary disease caused by mutations in the FAM20C 
gene. Only 18 non-lethal cases have been reported, the majority of them being 
children and young adults aged up to 30. Due to the rarity of the disease, 
genotype-phenotype correlations are not available and patient life expectancy is 
unknown, thus making descriptions of each novel case of particular importance. 
In this article, we describe a case of an Armenian woman, living in Russia, who 
was followed-up from age 36 to 39, presenting with pain in the extremities, 
osteosclerosis with periosteal bone formation, multiple calcifications in solid 
organs, midface hypoplasia, exophthalmos, amelogenesis imperfecta, shortening of 
distal phalanges, pectus excavatum, and hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate 
wasting. Whole exome sequencing was performed on NextSeq 550 (Illumina, USA) and 
compound heterozygous variants were identified in the FAM20C gene (reference 
sequence NM_020223): a frameshift insertion c.1107_1108insTACTG (p.Tyr369fs) and 
a missense substitution c.1375C > G (p.Arg459Gly). This is the first reported 
case of a middle-aged patient presenting classical symptoms of Raine syndrome 
caused by novel compound heterozygous mutations in the conserved C-terminal 
domain of FAM20C gene.

BACKGROUND: Mitral valve repair (MVr) for severe, degenerative mitral 
regurgitation is the gold standard, because medical management carries poor 
prognosis. However, despite clear benefit of MVr, many eligible patients are 
untreated. This study investigated whether MVr restores patients to normal life 
expectancy, at any age of operation, by comparing long-term survival of patients 
after MVr with the life expectancy of the general United States population.
METHODS: This retrospective study investigated 1011 patients with degenerative 
mitral regurgitation who underwent isolated MVr between 2003 and 2017. 
Parametric distribution analysis was applied to long-term post-MVr mortality 
data, and Weibull probability plots provided the best-fit distribution by 
Anderson-Darling Goodness-of-Fit testing. Confidence intervals of the estimated 
distribution were used to compare additional life expectancy after MVr to the 
general US population across multiple decades of life. Patients after MVr were 
categorized by age into decade (range, 20-89 years).
RESULTS: The life expectancy of patients after MVr matched the life expectancy 
of the general US population at any age between 40 and 89 years. Lower-bound 
one-sided 95% confidence intervals for additional life expectancy were not 
appreciably different from corresponding median additional life expectancy of 
the general population. There were few deaths in the 20- to 39-year-old group, 
limiting predictability, but survival also appeared normative.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that degenerative MVr restores anticipated 
life expectancy to that of the general population, regardless of age. Although 
our findings underscore the importance of repair for degenerative mitral 
disease, larger studies with longer term follow-up are needed to reinforce this 
finding, particularly for younger patients.

BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of Russian economic evaluation studies 
in oncology, the scope and quality of which are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the scope and quality of economic 
evaluations in oncology, with the goal of elucidating implications for improving 
their use in Russia.
METHODS: Online databases were searched for oncologic economic evaluations 
written in Russian. Data were extracted and assessed with the Quality of Health 
Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. In addition, the QHES was modified to 
overcome double-barreled items in a single criterion.
RESULTS: Of 29 articles identified, 15 met study criteria and were included in 
the review. Most studies analyzed cost-effectiveness of first- and second-line 
therapies for lung and kidney cancer. The others analyzed prostate, breast, and 
colorectal cancers and lymphoma. The QHES mean quality score for the reviewed 
studies was 74 (and 69 with the modified tool). Comparison of the quality of 
different study types revealed that cost utility studies and studies that used 
decision trees and Markov models had the highest mean quality score. Clear 
statements regarding bias, study limitations, uncertainty, study perspectives, 
and funding source were commonly absent in the reviewed studies.
CONCLUSION: Our review indicates that oncologic economic evaluations published 
in Russian are limited in scope and number. In addition, they demonstrate 
opportunities for improvement in several important technical areas.

Gums are a class of naturally occurring polysaccharides/carbohydrate polymers 
derived from renewable sources, which have the capacity to hydrate in water 
either by forming a gel or stabilizing emulsion systems. Among the substitutes 
recently considered to replace the application of petroleum-derived polymers 
against postharvest diseases and shelf life extension, gums and their 
derivatives have been considered as promising biocontrol products. 
Polysaccharide gum coatings provide a semipermeable barrier on the surface of 
produce to reduce respiration rate, weight loss and maintain the nutritional 
value. Gums have been used as excellent vehicles for active substances, also 
controlling the speed of diffusion of these, and improving the control of the 
maturation of fruit and vegetable. Additionally, plant extracts, essential oils, 
phenolic compounds, and vitamins can be incorporated into polysaccharides edible 
coatings in order to improve their mechanical barrier, antioxidant and 
antimicrobial properties. Gums have many advantages over the synthetic polymers, 
because they have been approved as GRAS by FAO, and their use is safe for the 
consumer and eco-friendly. This review aims to highlight the most relevant and 
current information in the use of polysaccharides in postharvest shelf life 
extension and preservation of overall quality of fruits and vegetables.

Food loss is a global concern nowadays. Fresh produce has the highest rate of 
loss among food products. In this study, nanocellulose suspensions were employed 
to coat on a perishable vegetable (spinach) for extending its shelf life during 
postharvest storage. Two mechanical defibrillation methods were studied to 
obtain a suitable preparation of nanocellulose suspension. A method of stock gel 
dilutions was selected since it provided longer stability of nanocellulose 
suspension. Then, physiological changes of spinach leaves coated with 
nanocellulose were measured compared with uncoated leaves. The results revealed 
that the coated leaves with 0.3 and 0.5% w/v nanocellulose concentrations 
displayed the significant retentions of appearance, chlorophyll, color, and 
moisture content after 3-day storage at 25 °C. Moreover, all of the coated 
samples exhibited the significant reduction of respiration rate in the range of 
54-70%. These finding suggested that the nanocellulose coating improves the 
storage capacity of spinach.

Case Report of Nursing Care for a Pregnant Woman With Cystic Fibrosis.

Stayer DL, Culver ED, Brosius HM, Stamm JA.

Life expectancy for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) has significantly 
increased during the last few decades, and subsequently, more women with CF are 
considering pregnancy. A detailed understanding of the management of pregnancy, 
specific pulmonary treatments, and necessary medications is essential to provide 
specialized care for women with CF. In this article, we present the physical and 
psychosocial aspects of care for pregnant women with CF and describe a case 
involving the planned pregnancy of a nulliparous woman with CF. We suggest 
vigilant monitoring for adequate nutrition, weight gain, and pulmonary function 
throughout pregnancy as implications for nursing care.

BACKGROUND: The pentavalent antimonial compounds are the first drug of choice 
for leishmania infection, but have several side effects that cause some 
restriction for use. Extension of nanoparticle use in biological research and 
proven effectiveness of manganese nanoparticles on fungi and bacteria, along 
with the lack of information about its antileishmanial effects, have motivated 
this study. Manganese can induce cell apoptosis by increasing FOXO3a-Bim/PUMA 
mRNA activation and activating of caspase-3 pathway.
METHODS: This study was aimed to examine the efficacy of manganese oxide 
nanoparticles againstLeishmania major (MRHO/IR/75/ER) in vitro and in vivo. To 
evaluate the antileishmanial activity of NPs, light microscopic observation was 
used to determine the number of remaining parasites in each well. The MTT test 
was used to determine the cytotoxicity effects of Mn2O3 NPs against L. major 
promastigotes and macrophage cells. The effect of nanoparticles on cultured 
amastigotes under in vitro conditions was also investigated. The possible 
apoptosis of L. major by Mn2O3 NPs was evaluated with flow cytometry assay. 
Additionally, the preventive and therapeutic effects of Mn2O3 NPs in BALB/c mice 
following cutaneous L. major infection was tested. The effect of Mn2O3 NPs on 
promastigotes and amastigotes were proven by MTT assay and amastigote assay, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The IC50 value of Mn2O3 NPs against L. major promastigotes and 
macrophages was 15 and 40 μg ml-1 respectively. The results of flow cytometry 
showed about 57% of the promastigotes were induced to apoptosis with Mn2O3 NPs. 
In in vivo studies, the size of the ulcers were significantly reduced, and the 
survival rate of the mice, in comparison with the control group, was increased.
CONCLUSION: Mn2O3 NPs has a beneficial effect on L. major promastigotes in vitro 
and in vivo and could be considered as a candidate for the treatment of this 
infection.

PURPOSE: Tibial plateau fractures with the involvement of the posterior column 
are an important prognostic factor towards poor functional outcome. We aimed to 
assess the sporting abilities postoperatively with special emphasis on the type 
of sports and sport-specific movements, as well as time needed to resume sports, 
restricting factors in sports engagement, and patient satisfaction. We aimed to 
provide prognostic information on return to sports.
METHODS: Demographic, clinical and radiological variables were retrospectively 
collected from 82 multicentric patients between 2014 and 2016. Prospectively, 
sporting abilities before and after surgery were determined using questionnaires 
at a mean follow-up of 33 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Involvement in sports significantly decreased, with only 68.4% of 
patients resuming sports (p < 0.001). The mean time needed to partially or fully 
resume sports was 6-9 and 9-12 months, respectively. The ability to resume at 
the pre-injury level of effort and performance was 22% and 12%, respectively. 
Restricting factors were pain (66%), fear of re-injury (37%), limited range of 
motion (26%), and instability (21%). The majority (59%) of patients were 
unsatisfied with their physical abilities. Significantly worse outcomes were 
observed in patients playing high-impact sports, experiencing knee pain during 
physical activity, suffering from extension/valgus or flexion/varus trauma.
CONCLUSIONS: Tibial plateau fractures with the involvement of the posterior 
column significantly hamper the patients' sporting abilities, leaving the 
majority of patients unsatisfied. Preoperative counseling about prognosis, 
setting realistic expectations, optimizing rehabilitation and pain management 
postoperatively, and advising low-impact sports might improve engagement in 
physical activities and emotional impact on patients.

OBJECTIVES: The ability to translate increases in life expectancy into 
additional years in good health is a crucial challenge for public health 
policies. We question the success of these policies in Switzerland, a forerunner 
of longevity, through the evolution of healthy life expectancy (HLE) across 
socioeconomic groups.
METHODS: Education-specific HLE conditioning on surviving to age 30 was computed 
for 5-year periods from the Swiss National Cohort, a mortality follow-up of the 
entire resident population, and the Swiss Health Interview Survey, reporting 
self-rated health. We compare time trends and decompose them into health, 
mortality and education components.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2015, comparable gains in LE (males: 5.02 years; 
females: 3.09 years) and HLE (males: 4.52 years; females: 3.09 years) were 
observed. People with compulsory education, however, experienced morbidity 
expansion, while those with middle and high education experienced morbidity 
compression.
CONCLUSIONS: Divergence of morbid years by educational levels may reflect 
unequal access to preventive care due to high out-of-pockets contributions in 
the healthcare system. This growing gap and the exhaustion of the educational 
dividend jeopardize future increases in HLE.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric patients often suffer from a long history of pain and have 
a limited life expectancy. Cannabinoid receptor agonists like dronabinol may be 
an effective, low-risk treatment option for geriatric patients with chronic 
pain.
OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness and side effects of dronabinol therapy in 
geriatric patients are analyzed. The effects of the approval requirement are 
presented.
METHODS: In our retrospective monocentric cohort study, the study population 
comprised all geriatric patients over the age of 80 years who were treated in 
our office since the cannabis law came into effect on 10 March 2017 until 
17 July 2018 (evaluation date). Geriatric, nonpalliative pain patients (group A) 
and geriatric palliative patients (group B) were investigated. The basis of the 
evaluation was a questionnaire sheet that we use in our office with details of 
dosages, pain intensity, treatment effects and side effects from dronabinol 
therapy.
RESULTS: By using dronabinol, 21 of the 40 geriatric patients (52.5%) achieved 
pain relief of more than 30%, 10% of the patients of more than 50%. On average, 
about four symptoms or side effects related to previous treatment were 
positively influenced. 26% of patients reported side effects. The rejection 
rates on the part of the health insurances were 38.7% (group A) and 10.3% 
(group B).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the few analyses of the use of Dronabinol in 
geriatric patients. We show that cannabis-based drugs (in this case dronabinol) 
are an effective, low-risk treatment option that should be considered early in 
therapy. Regarding the indication spectrum, further clinical studies and an 
approval-free test phase are necessary.

BACKGROUND: With the changes in environmental, medical technique, population 
structure and national health projects, human mortality rates have undergone 
great changes all over the world. According to "World Health Statistics 2016: 
Monitoring Health for the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)", we can draw a 
globally vision about life expectancy and cause of death; also, significant 
inequality still persists within and among countries. This study was designed to 
research into the trend of mortality pattern in China, evaluate the disparities 
of age-specific and disease-specific mortality rates between male and female, 
and provides a scientific basis for further prevention strategies and policies 
design.
METHODS: Data from the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points system were used to 
calculate crude and age-adjusted death rates, annual percent changes (APC) for 
men and women during 2004 to 2016. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) were 
performed through the direct method with the World Health Organization's World 
Standard Population. APC, according to log linear model, was adopted to describe 
the mortality rate trend. The χ2 test was used to compare differences between 
age-specific and cause-specific mortality rates of men and women. Data analysis 
and figures were completed by R software.
RESULTS: The mortality rates of men and women have decreased significantly 
(P < 0.05) during 2004-2016, and the APC were1.98 and 2.45%, respectively. In 
2016, the crude mortality rate (CMR) and ASMR in all causes of death were 658.50 
and 490.28 per 100,000 per year, respectively. The 5 leading causes of death 
were malignant neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, COPD, and 
accidental injury. The mortality rates of men were higher than that of women in 
all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: There are severe health gaps and disparities between male and 
female, and the chronic non-communicable diseases continue to be a serious 
health threat to Chinese residents.

BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality 
after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) based solely on their age. 
The aim of our study was to evaluate survival of nonagenarians with severe 
aortic valve stenosis (AS) after TAVR as compared to an age- and sex-matched 
general population.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2017, 1052 consecutive patients ≥80 years scheduled for 
TAVR were included. Patients were divided into three groups depending on their 
age at the time of the procedure: 80-84 (Group 1), 85-89 (Group 2) and ≥90 years 
(Group 3). Survival of patients treated with TAVR was compared to the life 
expectancy of an age- and sex-matched cohort in the general population.
RESULTS: Nonagenarians were more likely to experience major access-site 
complications than their younger counterparts (7.6% Group 1 vs. 10.1% Group 2 
vs. 17.6% Group 3, p=0.016). One-year mortality in nonagenarians was higher as 
compared to the general population (27.8% vs. 20.0%). After two years, the 
mortality curves between the TAVR patients and the general population converged 
(39.2% vs. 37.5%) and were lower after five years.
CONCLUSIONS: During the observation period of five years, carefully selected 
nonagenarians treated with TAVR had at least the same mortality rate as an age- 
and sex-matched general population after two years despite procedure-associated 
complications. The negative prognostic impact of the severe AS was completely 
eliminated by TAVR.

    Lancet Haematol. 2019 Nov;6(11):e543-e544.

BACKGROUND: Aplastic anaemia is a rare, life-threatening condition, 
characterised by pancytopenia with hypocellular bone marrow. Haematopoietic stem 
cells and most progenitor cells express thrombopoietin receptor (c-MPL). 
Romiplostim is a peptibody with c-MPL agonist activity that stimulates 
endogenous thrombopoietin production and leads to promoting the proliferation 
and differentiation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. In this phase 2 trial 
we aimed to assess the activity and safety of romiplostim in patients with 
aplastic anaemia who were previously treated with immunosuppressive therapy.
METHODS: We did an open-label, phase 2 study including a randomised, parallel, 
dose-finding part followed by an extension part to evaluate long-term treatment 
at two clinical centres in Seoul, South Korea. Eligible patients were aged 19 
years or older, and had aplastic anaemia confirmed by bone marrow and 
cytogenetic studies and thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤30 × 109/L), an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 2 or lower, and 
were previously treated with immunosuppressive therapy, including at least one 
course of antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporin. In the dose-finding part, 
patients were randomly assigned to fixed dose cohorts (1, 3, 6, or 10 μg/kg) of 
subcutaneous romiplostim once weekly for 8 weeks, according to a static 
allocation procedure after stratification by platelet count. In the extension 
part of the study, patients continued romiplostim titrated every 4 weeks in 
single steps (1, 3, 6, 10, 13, 16, and 20 μg/kg once weekly), depending on 
platelet response and safety up to 1 year (weeks 9-52). Patients who had a 
platelet response during weeks 46-53 continued dose titration in single steps 
(3, 6, 10, 13, 16, and 20 μg/kg once weekly) for an additional 2 years (weeks 
53-156). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 
platelet response at week 9 (after completion of the dose-finding part). 
Activity was assessed per-protocol in all patients evaluable for response at 
week 9 and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of 
romiplostim. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02094417.
FINDINGS: Between April 14 and Nov 24, 2014, 35 patients were enrolled and 
randomly assigned to one of four dose cohorts: romiplostim 1 μg/kg (n=7), 3 
μg/kg (n=9), 6 μg/kg (n=9), and 10 μg/kg (n=10). Data cutoff for this final 
analysis was on April 14, 2018. The median duration of treatment for all 
patients was 53 weeks (IQR 35-155). Ten (30%) of 33 evaluable patients achieved 
a platelet response at week 9, including seven (70%) of ten patients in the 10 
μg/kg cohort, three (33%) of nine patients in the 6 μg/kg cohort, and no 
patients in both the 3 μg/kg and 1 μg/kg cohorts. During the extension study, 18 
(55%) of 33 evaluable patients had a platelet response during weeks 46-53 and 
were eligible for continued treatment. Ten (30%) patients maintained a platelet 
response at 2 and 3 years, of whom nine had an erythroid response and five a 
neutrophil response, and completed protocol treatment. Treatment-related adverse 
events occurred in three (9%) of 35 patients, including grade 1 or 2 myalgia, 
fatigue, and dizziness. 17 (49%) of 35 patients had adverse events of grade 3 or 
higher; seven (20%) had serious adverse events (one event of febrile 
neutropenia, cataract, retinal detachment, macular fibrosis, inguinal hernia, 
appendicitis, cellulitis, tendon injury, and transfusion reaction); and one 
patient died from sepsis during treatment; none of these events were related to 
treatment. No patients developed clonal evolution.
INTERPRETATION: Romiplostim seems to be active and has a favourable safety 
profile in patients with refractory aplastic anaemia. 10 μg/kg once weekly might 
be used as a recommended starting dose in future studies. These findings warrant 
further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the key metric for monitoring progress towards 
sustainable development goal target 3.4 that is measuring premature 
noncommunicable disease mortality (deaths among people aged 30-69 years), is 
ageist.
METHODS: To examine the relationship between premature noncommunicable disease 
mortality and noncommunicable disease mortality in older people, a database of 
mortality rates for cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and diabetes in people aged 30 to 69 years and 70 to 89 years 
was compiled using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. The 
data covered 195 countries, six time-points and both sexes, giving 2340 
instances. The World Health Organization's (WHO's) life-table method for the 
premature noncommunicable disease mortality metric was applied to the data.
FINDINGS: There was a strong correlation between noncommunicable disease 
mortality patterns in the premature and older age groups, which suggests that 
measuring premature noncommunicable disease mortality is informative about such 
mortality in later life. Neither time nor geographical location had a 
substantial effect on this correlation. However, there were female-to-male 
differences in age-specific probabilities of death due to noncommunicable 
disease, implying that noncommunicable disease mortality should be assessed 
using a sex-disaggregated approach.
CONCLUSION: As the established WHO metric for premature noncommunicable disease 
mortality was predictive of noncommunicable disease mortality in older people, 
the metric should not be construed as ageist. Focusing resources on measuring 
premature noncommunicable disease mortality will be appropriate, particularly in 
settings without universal civil death registration. This approach should not 
prejudice the provision of health services throughout the life-course.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Rechercher si l'indicateur clé permettant de suivre la 
progression par rapport à la cible 3.4 des Objectifs de développement durable, 
qui mesure la mortalité prématurée due à des maladies non transmissibles (décès 
parmi les personnes de 30 à 69 ans), fait preuve d'âgisme.
MÉTHODES: Afin d'examiner la relation entre la mortalité prématurée due à des 
maladies non transmissibles et la mortalité de personnes plus âgées due à ce 
même type de maladies, nous avons établi une base de données répertoriant les 
taux de mortalité due à des maladies cardiovasculaires, au cancer, à la 
bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive et au diabète chez les personnes âgées 
de 30 à 69 ans et de 70 à 89 ans, à l'aide d'estimations de l'étude 2017 sur la 
charge mondiale de morbidité (Global Burden of Disease Study). Les données 
portaient sur 195 pays, six points temporels ainsi que sur les deux sexes, et 
donnaient 2340 exemples. La méthode des tables de mortalité de l'Organisation 
mondiale de la Santé (OMS), employée pour l'indicateur de la mortalité 
prématurée due à des maladies non transmissibles, a été appliquée à ces données.
RÉSULTATS: Il est apparu une forte corrélation entre les schémas de mortalité 
due à des maladies non transmissibles des deux groupes d'âge, ce qui suggère que 
la mesure de la mortalité prématurée due à des maladies non transmissibles 
renseigne sur la mortalité pour les mêmes causes à un âge plus avancé. Ni le 
temps ni le lieu géographique n'avaient d'effet notable sur cette corrélation. 
En revanche, on a observé des différences entre hommes et femmes dans les 
probabilités de décès dû à des maladies non transmissibles selon l'âge, ce qui 
implique qu'il faudrait évaluer la mortalité due à des maladies non 
transmissibles en différenciant les sexes.
CONCLUSION: Étant donné que l'indicateur établi par l'OMS pour la mortalité 
prématurée due à des maladies non transmissibles permettait de prédire la 
mortalité des personnes plus âgées due à ce même type de maladies, il 
conviendrait de ne pas interpréter cet indicateur comme faisant preuve d'âgisme. 
Il sera judicieux de concentrer les ressources sur la mesure de la mortalité 
prématurée due à des maladies non transmissibles, en particulier dans les 
régions qui n'ont pas de système universel d'enregistrement des décès. Cette 
démarche ne doit pas nuire à la fourniture de services de soins tout au long de 
la vie.

en las personas mayores, se compiló una base de datos de las tasas de mortalidad 
por enfermedades cardiovasculares, cáncer, enfermedades pulmonares obstructivas 
crónicas y diabetes en personas de 30 a 69 años y de 70 a 89 años de edad, 
utilizando las estimaciones del Estudio sobre la Carga Mundial de las 
Enfermedades 2017. Los datos abarcaban 195 países, seis puntos temporales y 
ambos sexos, lo que representaba 2 340 casos. Se aplicó a los datos el método de 
la tabla de mortalidad prematura por enfermedades no transmisibles de la 
Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).
RESULTADOS: Hubo una fuerte correlación entre las pautas de mortalidad por 
enfermedades no transmisibles en los grupos de edad prematura y de edad 
avanzada, lo que indica que la medición de la mortalidad prematura por 
enfermedades no transmisibles es informativa sobre esa mortalidad en etapas 
posteriores de la vida. Ni el tiempo ni la ubicación geográfica tuvieron un 
efecto sustancial en esta correlación. Sin embargo, existen diferencias entre 
las mujeres y los hombres en cuanto a las probabilidades específicas de muerte 
por enfermedades no transmisibles, lo que implica que la mortalidad por 
enfermedades no transmisibles debe evaluarse mediante un enfoque desagregado por 
sexo.
