IMPORTANCE: Many cost-utility analyses rely on generic utility measures for 
estimates of disease impact. Commonly used generic preference-based indexes may 
generate different absolute estimates of disease burden despite sharing anchors 
of dead at 0 and full health at 1.0.
OBJECTIVE: We compare the impact of 16 prevalent chronic health conditions using 
6 utility-based indexes of health and a visual analog scale.
DESIGN: Data were from the National Health Measurement Study (NHMS), a 
cross-sectional telephone survey of 3844 adults aged 35 to 89 years in the 
United States.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The NHMS included the EuroQol-5D-3L, Health and 
Activities Limitation Index (HALex), Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and 
Mark 3 (HUI3), preference-based scoring for the SF-36v2 (SF-6D), Quality of 
Well-Being Scale, and visual analog scale. Respondents self-reported 16 chronic 
conditions. Survey-weighted regression analyses for each index with all health 
conditions, age, and sex were used to estimate health condition impact estimates 
in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost over 10 years. All analyses 
were stratified by ages 35 to 69 and 70 to 89 years.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between the indexes for estimates of 
the absolute impact of most conditions. On average, condition impacts were the 
smallest with the SF-6D and EQ-5D-3L and the largest with the HALex and HUI3. 
Likewise, the estimated loss of QALYs varied across indexes. Condition impact 
estimates for EQ-5D-3L, HUI2, HUI3, and SF-6D generally had strong Spearman 
correlations across conditions (i.e., >0.69).
LIMITATIONS: This analysis uses cross-sectional data and lacks health condition 
severity information.
CONCLUSIONS: Health condition impact estimates vary substantially across the 
indexes. These results imply that it is difficult to standardize results across 
cost-utility analyses that use different utility measures.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related death. 
Increasing incidence and mortality indicates a lack of detection and post 
diagnostic management of this disease. Recent evidences suggest that, miRNAs are 
very attractive target molecules that can serve as biomarkers for predicting 
development and progression of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, miRNAs are also 
promising therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer. The objective of the 
present review is to discuss the significance of miRNA in pancreatic cancer 
development, diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. We extracted and compiled the 
useful information from PubMed database, which satisfied our criteria for 
analysis of miRNAs in pancreatic cancer diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. A 
summary of the most important miRNAs known to regulate pancreatic tumorigenesis 
is provided. The review also provides a collection of evidence that show miRNA 
profiles of biofluids hold much promise for use as biomarkers to predict and 
detect development of pancreatic cancer in its early stages. Identification of 
key miRNA networks in pancreatic cancer will provide long-awaited 
diagnostic/therapeutic/prognostic tools for early detection, better treatment 
options, and extended life expectancy and quality of life in PDAC patients.

Differences in social advantage significantly influence health conditions and 
life expectancy within any population. Such factors reproduce historic class, 
race, and ethnic disparities in community success. Few populations in the United 
States face more social and economic disadvantage than farmworkers, and 
farmworker housing has significant potential to ameliorate or amplify the health 
impact of those disadvantages. Drawing on the limited direct research on 
farmworkers, and on additional research about poor, isolated, and immigrant 
societies, we propose four mechanisms through which housing can be expected to 
affect farmworker health: quality of social capital within farmworker 
communities, stress effects of poor housing situations, effects of housing on 
social support for healthy behaviors, and interactions among these factors, 
especially effects on children that can last for generations. Policy and 
planning definitions of "adequate" farmworker housing should take a more 
holistic view of housing needs to support specific social and community benefits 
in design decisions.

PURPOSE: To determine whether screening for age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) during a diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program would be cost 
effective in Hong Kong.
DESIGN: We compared and evaluated the impacts of screening, grading, and vitamin 
treatment for intermediate AMD compared with no screening using a Markov model. 
It was based on the natural history of AMD in a cohort with a mean age of 62 
years, followed up until 100 years of age or death.
PARTICIPANTS: Subjects attending a DR screening program were recruited.
METHOD: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken from a public provider 
perspective. It included grading for AMD using the photographs obtained for DR 
screening and treatment with vitamin therapy for those with intermediate AMD. 
The measures of effectiveness were obtained largely from a local study, but the 
transition probabilities and utility values were from overseas data. Costs were 
all from local sources. The main assumptions and estimates were tested in 
sensitivity analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. Both costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. All costs are 
reported in United States dollars ($).
RESULTS: The cost per QALY gained through screening for AMD and vitamin 
treatment for appropriate cases was $12,712 after discounting. This would be 
considered highly cost effective based on the World Health Organization's 
threshold of willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY, that is, less than the annual 
per capita gross domestic product of $29,889. Because of uncertainty regarding 
the utility value for those with advanced AMD, we also tested an extreme, 
conservative value for utility under which screening remained cost effective. 
One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that, besides utility values, the cost per 
QALY was most sensitive to the progression rate from intermediate to advanced 
AMD. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed a WTP for a QALY of 
$29,000 or more has a more than 86% probability of being cost effective compared 
with no screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that AMD screening carried out 
simultaneously with DR screening for patients with diabetes would be cost 
effective in a Hong Kong public healthcare setting.

Medical care of the geriatric patient is an important area of focus as the 
population ages and life expectancy increases. In particular, critical care of 
the geriatric patient will be especially affected, because geriatric patients 
will consume most critical care beds in the future and subsequently require 
increased use of resources. This review focuses on the physiologic effects of 
aging on all body systems. Focus on frailty and its effect on recovery from 
critical illness and its potential to modify the course of patient care will be 
important areas of research in the future.

The mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates critical immune 
processes that remain incompletely defined. Interest in mTOR inhibitor drugs is 
heightened by recent demonstrations that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin extends 
lifespan and healthspan in mice. Rapamycin or related analogues (rapalogues) 
also mitigate age-related debilities including increasing antigen-specific 
immunity, improving vaccine responses in elderly humans, and treating cancers 
and autoimmunity, suggesting important new clinical applications. Nonetheless, 
immune toxicity concerns for long-term mTOR inhibition, particularly 
immunosuppression, persist. Although mTOR is pivotal to fundamental, important 
immune pathways, little is reported on immune effects of mTOR inhibition in 
lifespan or healthspan extension, or with chronic mTOR inhibitor use. We 
comprehensively analyzed immune effects of rapamycin as used in lifespan 
extension studies. Gene expression profiling found many and novel changes in 
genes affecting differentiation, function, homeostasis, exhaustion, cell death, 
and inflammation in distinct T- and B-lymphocyte and myeloid cell 
subpopulations. Immune functions relevant to aging and inflammation, and to 
cancer and infections, and innate lymphoid cell effects were validated in vitro 
and in vivo. Rapamycin markedly prolonged lifespan and healthspan in cancer- and 
infection-prone mice supporting disease mitigation as a mechanism for mTOR 
suppression-mediated longevity extension. It modestly altered gut metagenomes, 
and some metagenomic effects were linked to immune outcomes. Our data show novel 
mTOR inhibitor immune effects meriting further studies in relation to longevity 
and healthspan extension.

OBJECTIVE: While dating is critical in the formation of a lifelong romantic 
relationship, women with breast cancer or a genetic susceptibility to developing 
this disease report a myriad of dating concerns. This review synthesises and 
discusses the perceived dating barriers and concerns in this population.
METHOD: A systematic search of CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed was 
undertaken and yielded 19 published qualitative studies. Papers were subjected 
to critical appraisal to ensure the integrity of findings.
RESULTS: Six areas of concern were identified: Feeling unattractive due to 
treatment side effects; perceiving limited dating partners available; 
determining how, when and what to disclose; fear of cancer recurrence and 
reduced life expectancy; apprehension about entering into a new sexual 
relationship; and dating urgency and not wanting to 'waste time' on partners 
without long-term potential.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a valuable synthesis of the complex issues, 
concerns and decisions that single women face at different stages of 
relationship formation following their breast cancer experience. Future research 
is warranted to explore the perceptions, appraisals and beliefs underlying these 
concerns, to help guide the future design and development of appropriate 
informational and supportive care offered to breast cancer patients.

PURPOSE: Trend-based analyses examining rates of visual field (VF) loss in 
glaucoma are useful for predicting risk of vision-related morbidity. Although 
patients with faster losses are likely to require treatment escalation, little 
is known about rates that might trigger a decision to intervene surgically. The 
aims of this study were to investigate prior rates of VF loss in patients 
attending for trabeculectomy and to estimate, in the absence of surgical 
intervention, lifetime risk of visual impairment, and blindness.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 117 eyes of 86 consecutive 
patients with glaucoma attending for trabeculectomy, including 53 patients 
referred from general ophthalmology clinics and 33 patients from specialist 
glaucoma clinics. Rates of change in standard automated perimetry mean deviation 
were examined using linear regression and random coefficient models. Risk of 
lifetime visual impairment and blindness was calculated using life expectancy 
data.
RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 71.0±9.7 years. Patients were followed for 
10.7±7.5 years prior to surgery with an average of seven useable fields per eye. 
On average patients referred from general clinics lost 1.04 dB/year compared 
with 0.77 dB/year in those referred from glaucoma clinics (P=0.070). Patients 
referred from general clinics had more medication changes prior to surgery (3.4 
and 2.6 changes, respectively; P=0.004). Given Scottish life expectancy data, 
untreated, 61 eyes (52%) would have passed the threshold for visual impairment, 
whereas 40 (34%) would have passed the threshold demarcating blindness.
CONCLUSION: Patients attending for trabeculectomy had faster average rates of 
field loss prior to surgery than published values for the general glaucoma 
population with over one-third of eyes studied predicted to have become blind 
without intervention. Those managed by glaucoma specialists had fewer changes in 
medication and tended to slower rates of VF loss, although the latter did not 
reach statistical significance.

    Eye (Lond). 2016 Aug;30(8):1150-2.

BACKGROUND: Keratoconus is a progressive degenerative corneal disorder of 
children and young adults that is traditionally managed by refractive error 
correction, with corneal transplantation reserved for the most severe cases. UVA 
collagen crosslinking is a novel procedure that aims to prevent disease 
progression, currently being considered for use in the UK NHS. We assess whether 
it might be a cost-effective alternative to standard management for patients 
with progressive keratoconus.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model in which we estimated disease progression 
from prospective follow-up studies, derived costs derived from the NHS National 
Tariff, and calculated utilities from linear regression models of visual acuity 
in the better-seeing eye. We performed deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of possible variations in the model 
parameters.
RESULTS: Collagen crosslinking is cost effective compared with standard 
management at an incremental cost of £ 3174 per QALY in the base case. 
Deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that this could rise above £ 33,263 per 
QALY if the duration of treatment efficacy is limited to 5 years. Other model 
parameters are not decision significant. Collagen crosslinking is cost effective 
in 85% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 30,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: UVA collagen crosslinking is very likely to be cost effective, 
compared with standard management, for the treatment of progressive keratoconus. 
However, further research to explore its efficacy beyond 5 years is desirable.

OBJECT: Cervical stenosis is a defining feature of cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy (CSM). Matsunaga et al. proposed that elements of stenosis are both 
static and dynamic, where the dynamic elements magnify the canal deformation of 
the static state. For the current study, the authors hypothesized that dynamic 
changes may be associated with myelopathy severity and neck disability. This 
goal of this study was to present novel methods of dynamic motion analysis in 
CSM.
METHODS: A post hoc analysis was performed of a prospective, multicenter 
database of patients with CSM from the AOSpine North American study. One hundred 
ten patients (34%) met inclusion criteria, which were symptomatic CSM, age over 
18 years, baseline flexion/extension radiographs, and health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) questionnaires (modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association [mJOA] 
score, Neck Disability Index [NDI], the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 
Physical Component Score [SF-36 PCS], and Nurick grade). The mean age was 56.9 ± 
12 years, and 42% of patients were women (n = 46). Correlations with HRQOL 
measures were analyzed for regional (cervical lordosis and cervical sagittal 
vertical axis) and focal parameters (kyphosis and spondylolisthesis between 
adjacent vertebrae) in flexion and extension. Baseline dynamic parameters 
(flexion/extension cone relative to a fixed C-7, center of rotation [COR], and 
range of motion arc relative to the COR) were also analyzed for correlations 
with HRQOL measures.
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean HRQOL measures demonstrated disability and the 
mean radiographic parameters demonstrated sagittal malalignment. Among regional 
parameters, there was a significant correlation between decreased neck flexion 
(increased C2-7 angle in flexion) and worse Nurick grade (R = 0.189, p = 0.048), 
with no significant correlations in extension. Focal parameters, including 
increased C-7 sagittal translation overT-1 (slip), were significantly correlated 
with greater myelopathy severity (mJOA score, Flexion R = -0.377, p = 0.003; 
mJOA score, Extension R = -0.261, p = 0.027). Sagittal slip at C-2 and C-4 also 
correlated with worse HRQOL measures. Reduced flexion/extension motion cones, a 
more posterior COR, and smaller range of motion correlated with worse general 
health SF-36 PCS and Nurick grade.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic motion analysis may play an important role in understanding 
CSM. Focal parameters demonstrated a significant correlation with worse HRQOL 
measures, especially increased C-7 sagittal slip in flexion and extension. Novel 
methods of motion analysis demonstrating reduced motion cones correlated with 
worse myelopathy grades. More posterior COR and smaller range of motion were 
both correlated with worse general health scores (SF-36 PCS and Nurick grade). 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate correlation of dynamic 
motion and listhesis with disability and myelopathy in CSM.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge on disability's impact among older women and men in 
Ecuador is limited. This paper provides gender-specific estimates of disability 
prevalence, life expectancy with and without disability, and the factors 
associated with gender differences in disability at older age in Ecuador 
(2009-2010).
METHODS: Data from the Health, Well-Being, and Aging Survey (SABE) Ecuador 2009 
was used. Participants were 4480 men and women aged 60 and over. Life expectancy 
with and without disability was calculated using the Sullivan method. Logistic 
regression analyses were used to explore gender differences in disability 
prevalence. Two disability measures, indicating limitations in activities of 
daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), were 
used.
RESULTS: 60-year-old women in Ecuador can expect to live 16.3 years without ADL 
limitations compared to 16.9 years for men. Life expectancy without IADL 
limitations was 12.5 years for women and 15.5 years for men. At age 60, women's 
length of life with ADL and IADL disability was higher (7.9 years for women vs. 
4.9 years for men with ADL, and 11.7 years for women vs. 6.3 years for men with 
IADL). After controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, chronic conditions 
and lifestyle factors, gender differences in ADL disability were not 
statistically significant. However, older women were 58% more likely (OR=1.58, 
95% CI 1.27, 1.95) to report having IADL limitations than men, even after 
including control variables.
CONCLUSION: Interventions should tackle chronic disease, physical inactivity, 
and socioeconomic differences to reduce women's vulnerability to disability in 
older age.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety of repeated 
courses of epratuzumab therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe systemic 
lupus erythematosus. Secondary objectives were to assess long-term efficacy and 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
METHODS: Eligible patients from the 12-week, phase IIb, randomized, 
placebo-controlled EMBLEM study enrolled into the open-label extension (OLE) 
study, SL0008. In the SL0008 study, patients received 1,200 mg epratuzumab 
infusions at weeks 0 and 2 of repeating 12-week cycles, plus standard of care. 
Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious 
TEAEs. Efficacy measures included combined treatment response, the British Isles 
Lupus Assessment Group score, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity 
Index score, and the physician's and patient's global assessment of disease 
activity. Total daily corticosteroid dose and HRQOL (by the Short Form 36 health 
survey) were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 113 of the 203 patients (55.7%) who entered the SL0008 study 
continued epratuzumab therapy until study closure (total cumulative exposure: 
381.3 patient-years, median exposure: 845 days, and maximum exposure: 1,185 
days/approximately 3.2 years). TEAEs were reported in 192 patients (94.6%); most 
common were infections and infestations (68.0%, 138 patients). Serious TEAEs 
were reported in 51 patients (25.1%), and 14 patients (6.9%) had serious 
infections. In patients treated for 108 weeks (n = 116), the median 
corticosteroid dose was reduced from 10.0 mg/day at OLE screening to 5.0 mg/day 
at week 108. Improvements in efficacy and HRQOL measures in EMBLEM were 
maintained in the OLE, while placebo patients exhibited similar improvements in 
disease activity upon a switch to epratuzumab.
CONCLUSION: Open-label epratuzumab treatment was well tolerated for up to 3.2 
years, and associated with sustained improvements in disease activity and HRQOL, 
while steroids were reduced.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although recommended by guidelines, the benefits of 
treating patients with atrial fibrillation with a low-stroke risk score, with 
aspirin or anticoagulants, have not been clearly established. With advent of 
safer non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, we assessed the clinical and 
economic implications of 5 mg BID of apixaban versus aspirin among patients with 
a relative low risk of stroke as assessed using the CHADS2 (congestive heart 
failure, hypertension, age>75, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic 
attack) and CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes 
mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease) stroke risk 
classification.
METHODS: A previously developed and validated Markov model was adapted. A 
secondary analysis of the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke 
in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K 
Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) study was conducted to estimate event rates in 
different low-risk cohorts by treatment. Three cohorts (n=1000) with a CHADS2 
score of 1, CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, and CHA2DS2-VASc of score 2 to 4 were 
simulated to assess the number of clinical events avoided in terms of strokes 
and major bleeds, as well as life years gained, quality-adjusted life years 
gained, costs, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained.
RESULTS: Apixaban was associated with fewer strokes and systemic embolism versus 
aspirin across all subgroups; however, it caused more major bleeding events. The 
reduction in systemic embolism offset the increase in major bleeding events 
leading to increased life expectancy and quality-adjusted life year gains, 
achieved at an increased cost that was lower than the UK threshold of $44,400 
(ie, £30,000) per quality-adjusted life year gained across the 3 cohorts 
examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant treatment with apixaban versus aspirin in low-risk 
patients, as identified using CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc, is projected to increase 
life expectancy and provide clinical benefits that are cost effective.

Inferring Speciation Processes from Patterns of Natural Variation in Microbial 
Genomes.

Microbial species concepts have long been the focus of contentious debate, 
fueled by technological limitations to the genetic resolution of species, by the 
daunting task of investigating phenotypic variation among individual microscopic 
organisms, and by a lack of understanding of gene flow in reproductively asexual 
organisms that are prone to promiscuous horizontal gene transfer. Population 
genomics, the emerging approach of analyzing the complete genomes of a multitude 
of closely related organisms, is poised to overcome these limitations by 
providing a window into patterns of genome variation revealing the evolutionary 
processes through which species diverge. This new approach is more than just an 
extension of previous multilocus sequencing technologies, in that it provides a 
comprehensive view of interacting evolutionary processes. Here we argue that the 
application of population genomic tools in a rigorous population genetic 
framework will help to identify the processes of microbial speciation and 
ultimately lead to a general species concept based on the unique biology and 
ecology of microorganisms.

Perampanel in the management of partial-onset seizures: a review of safety, 
efficacy, and patient acceptability.

Schulze-Bonhage A(1), Hintz M(1).

Perampanel (PER) is a novel antiepileptic drug recently introduced for the 
adjunctive treatment in epilepsy patients aged 12 years or older with 
partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in the US and 
Europe. Its antiepileptic action is based on noncompetitive inhibition of 
postsynaptic AMPA receptors, decreasing excitatory synaptic transmission. 
Evaluation of efficacy in three placebo-controlled randomized Phase III studies 
showed that add-on therapy of PER decreased seizure frequencies significantly 
compared to placebo at daily doses between 4 mg/day and 12 mg/day. PER's long 
half-life of 105 hours allows for once-daily dosing that is favorable for 
patient compliance with intake. Long-term extension studies showed a 62.5%-69.6% 
adherence of patients after 1 year of treatment, comparing favorably with other 
second-generation antiepileptic drugs. Whereas these trials demonstrated an 
overall favorable tolerability profile of PER, nonspecific central nervous 
system adverse effects like somnolence, dizziness, headache, and fatigue may 
occur. In addition, neuropsychiatric disturbances ranging from irritability to 
suicidality were reported in several case reports; both placebo-controlled and 
prospective long-term extension trials showed a low incidence of such behavioral 
and psychiatric complaints. For early recognition of neuropsychiatric symptoms 
like depression, anxiety, and aggression, slow titration and close monitoring 
during drug introduction are mandatory. This allows on the one hand to recognize 
patients particularly susceptible to adverse effects of the drug, and on the 
other hand to render the drug's full potential of seizure control available for 
the vast majority of patient groups tolerating the drug well.

BACKGROUND: Since its introduction in 1996, highly active antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART), which involves the combination of antiretroviral drugs, has resulted in 
significant improvements in the morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy of 
HIV-infected patients. Numerous studies of the cost-effectiveness of HAART from 
different perspectives in HIV have been reported.
AIM: To investigate the economic outcomes and relevance of HAART for people 
living with HIV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted on 22 
peer-reviewed full economic evaluations of people living with HIV treated with 
different HAART regimens and published in English between January 2005 and 
December 2014. Information regarding study details, such as interventions, 
outcomes, and modeling methods, was extracted. The high heterogeneity of the 
included studies rendered a meta-analysis inappropriate; therefore, we conducted 
a comparative analysis of studies grouped according to the similarity of the 
different intervention types and outcomes.
RESULTS: Most of the economic evaluations of HAART focused on comparisons 
between the specific HAART regimens and others from the following perspectives: 
injecting drug users versus noninjecting drug users, HIV-infected adults without 
AIDS versus those with AIDS, regimens based on developed world guidelines versus 
those based on developing world guidelines, self-administered HAART versus 
directly observed HAART, and "ideal" versus "typical" regimens.
CONCLUSION: In general, HAART is more cost-effective than other therapeutic 
regimens adopted so far. Further investigations, especially head-to-head 
comparisons of "ideal" and "typical" trials of different regimen combinations, 
are required to identify the optimal HAART regimens.

This paper discusses the transformations undergone by Mexican families in the 
20th century and how some internal dynamics unfolded with the increase in the 
individual life expectancy and the presence of functional incapacities in the 
older family members. It reflects on social and demographic changes in the 
families and on support and care strategies directed at elderly people who are 
ill and have functional limitations, based on calculations obtained from the 
Encuesta Nacional sobre Salud y Envejecimiento (2001). Although there are 
efforts on the part of health institutions and family arrangements to deal with 
this situation, this paper shows the strength and the weakness of the social 
protection systems regarding care and support for aged people with functional 
incapacity. It presents challenges and relevant action areas for public and 
non-public institutions. It proposes, based on this analysis, that institutions, 
families and the society should take active actions to support the elderly 
individual who undergoes the progressive deterioration of physical and mental 
faculties.

El presente documento se inscribe en la discusión sobre las transformaciones que 
han experimentado las familias en México en el siglo XX, y como se asoman 
algunas dinámicas al interior que son resultado del alargamiento en la esperanza 
de vida individual y de la presencia de limitaciones funcionales en los miembros 
en edad avanzada. Se reflexiona sobre los cambios sociales y demográficos en los 
hogares, las estrategias de apoyo y cuidado hacia las personas adultas mayores 
con presencia de enfermedades y limitaciones funcionales a partir de cálculos 
realizados con base en la Encuesta Nacional sobre Salud y Envejecimiento (2001). 
Si bien hay un esfuerzo de las instituciones de salud y de los arreglos 
familiares para atender esta situación, este artículo permite mostrar la fuerza 
y debilidad del sistema de protección social en la procuración de cuidados y 
apoyos hacia las personas en la vejez con limitaciones funcionales. Presenta 
algunos retos y áreas de acción relevantes para las instituciones 
gubernamentales y no gubernamentales. La idea que se propone, con base en este 
análisis, es reaccionar activamente entre instituciones, familias y sociedad 
para apoyar a la vejez que experimenta el deterioro progresivo de sus facultades 
físicas y mentales.

PURPOSE: The best treatment of distal radius fractures (DRFs) in the elderly is 
uncertain. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the outcomes of 
surgical and nonsurgical management of DRFs in persons 65 years of age or older.
METHODS: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched 
until April 27, 2015 using the following search terms: distal radius fracture, 
conservative treatment, nonoperative treatment, nonsurgical treatment, surgical 
treatment, operative, elderly, and older. The primary outcome measure was DASH 
score, and secondary outcomes were functional and radiological assessments. The 
standard difference in post-treatment means was calculated for the outcomes to 
compare the two groups.
RESULTS: Of 59 articles identified, eight studies with a total of 440 patients 
in the surgical groups and 449 in the control groups were included in the 
analysis. No significant differences in DASH score, VAS pain score, grip 
strength, wrist extension, pronation, or supination, and ulnar deviation were 
noted between the groups. The nonsurgical group had significantly greater wrist 
flexion, radial deviation, and ulnar variance and less radial inclination than 
the surgical group.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical and nonsurgical methods produce similar results in the 
treatment of DRFS in the elderly, and minor objective functional differences did 
not result an impact on subjective function outcome and quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: Rupture is the worst outcome of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). 
The decision to operate should include counterbalancing the risk of aneurysm 
rupture against the risk of aneurysm repair, within the context of a patient's 
overall life expectancy. Current surgical guidelines are based on population 
studies, and important variables are missed in predicting individual risk of 
rupture.
METHODS: In this literature review, we focused on the contribution of 
biomechanical and mathematical models in predicting risk of AAA rupture.
RESULTS: Anatomical features as diameter asymmetry and lack of tortuosity are 
shown to be anatomical risk factors of rupture. Wall stiffness (due to 
modifications of elastin and collagen composition) and increased inflammatory 
response are also factors that affect the structural integrity of the AAA wall. 
Biomechanical studies showed that wall strength is lower in ruptured than 
non-ruptured AAA. Intra-luminal thrombus also has a big role to play in the 
occurrence of rupture. Current mathematical models allow more variables to be 
included in predicting individual risk of rupture.
CONCLUSION: Moving away from using maximal transverse diameter of the AAA as a 
unique predictive factor and instead including biological, structural and 
biomechanical variables in predicting individual risk of rupture will be 
essential in the future and will help gain precision and accuracy in surgical 
indications.

BACKGROUND: Treatment for patients with breast cancer (BC) is guided by human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. The patient's HER2 status is 
assessed using US Food and Drug Administration-approved in vitro diagnostic 
(IVD) immunohistochemical (IHC) tests and laboratory-developed IVD tests. We 
analysed HER2 testing accuracy using data from the Nordic Immunohistochemistry 
Quality Control (NordiQC) HER2 IHC programme; results were used in an economic
