Newly emerging experimental techniques such as nano-ARPES are expected to 
provide an opportunity to measure the electronic properties of nano-materials 
directly. However, the interpretation of the spectra is not simple because it 
must consider quantum mechanical effects related to the measurement process 
itself. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach that can overcome this problem by 
using an adequate simulation to corroborate the experimental results. Ab initio 
calculation on arbitrarily-shaped or chemically ornamented nano-structures is 
elaborately correlated to photoemission theory. This correlation can be directly 
exploited to interpret the experimental results. To test this method, a direct 
comparison was made between the calculation results and experimental results on 
highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). As a general extension, the unique 
electronic structures of nano-sized graphene oxide and features from the 
experimental result of black phosphorous (BP) are disclosed for the first time 
as supportive evidence of the usefulness of this method. This work pioneers an 
approach to intuitive and practical understanding of the electronic properties 
of nano-materials.

OBJECTIVE: Mental and substance use disorders are responsible for significant 
health loss across the globe. In this review, the burden of disease attributable 
to mental and substance use disorders in Indigenous Australians and Pacific 
Island countries was described and compared.
METHODS: For Indigenous Australians, findings from the burden of disease and 
injury study by Begg and colleagues were summarised. These were then compared to 
the findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, which reported results 
for Oceania, a region consisting of Pacific Island countries. Results for mental 
and substance use disorder burden were described in terms of disability-adjusted 
life years, years lived with disability and years of life lost to due to 
premature mortality.
RESULTS: Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of non-fatal 
burden (i.e. disability) in both Indigenous Australia and Oceania. Furthermore, 
in Oceania mental and substance use disorders are projected to cause more 
disability than all communicable diseases combined by 2050.
CONCLUSION: Mental and substance use disorders contribute significantly to 
health loss for both Indigenous Australians and Pacific Island populations. 
These findings indicate a substantial need to prioritise these disorders in 
terms of policy, services and research.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk Factors 
study used the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) to quantify the burden of 
diseases, injuries, and risk factors. This paper provides an overview of injury 
estimates from the 2013 update of GBD, with detailed information on incidence, 
mortality, DALYs and rates of change from 1990 to 2013 for 26 causes of injury, 
globally, by region and by country.
METHODS: Injury mortality was estimated using the extensive GBD mortality 
database, corrections for ill-defined cause of death and the cause of death 
ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on inpatient and 
outpatient data sets, 26 cause-of-injury and 47 nature-of-injury categories, and 
seven follow-up studies with patient-reported long-term outcome measures.
RESULTS: In 2013, 973 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 942 to 993) people 
sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare and 4.8 million (UI 
4.5 to 5.1) people died from injuries. Between 1990 and 2013 the global 
age-standardised injury DALY rate decreased by 31% (UI 26% to 35%). The rate of 
decline in DALY rates was significant for 22 cause-of-injury categories, 
including all the major injuries.
CONCLUSIONS: Injuries continue to be an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in the developed and developing world. The decline in rates for almost 
all injuries is so prominent that it warrants a general statement that the world 
is becoming a safer place to live in. However, the patterns vary widely by 
cause, age, sex, region and time and there are still large improvements that 
need to be made.

Voltage gated ion channels play a major role in determining a neuron's firing 
behavior, resulting in the specific processing of synaptic input patterns. 
Drosophila and other invertebrates provide valuable model systems for 
investigating ion channel kinetics and their impact on firing properties. 
Despite the increasing importance of Drosophila as a model system, few 
computational models of its ion channel kinetics have been developed. In this 
study, experimentally observed biophysical properties of voltage gated ion 
channels from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster are used to develop a 
minimal, conductance based neuron model. We investigate the impact of the 
densities of these channels on the excitability of the model neuron. Changing 
the channel densities reproduces different in situ observed firing patterns and 
induces a switch from integrator to resonator properties. Further, we analyze 
the preference to input frequency and how it depends on the channel densities 
and the resulting bifurcation type the system undergoes. An extension to a three 
dimensional model demonstrates that the inactivation kinetics of the sodium 
channels play an important role, allowing for firing patterns with a delayed 
first spike and subsequent high frequency firing as often observed in 
invertebrates, without altering the kinetics of the delayed rectifier current.

Social Expectancy in ERPs During Social Feedback Processing.

Previous studies on social anxiety have demonstrated negative-expectancy bias in 
social contexts. In this study, we used a paradigm that employed self-relevant 
positive or negative social feedback, in order to test whether this negative 
expectancy manifests in event-related potentials (ERPs) during social evaluation 
among socially anxious individuals. Behavioral data revealed that individuals 
with social anxiety disorder (SAD) showed more negative expectancy of peer 
acceptance both in the experiment and in daily life than did the healthy control 
participants. Regarding ERP results, we found a overally larger P2 for positive 
social feedback and also a group main effect, such that the P2 was smaller in 
SAD group. SAD participants demonstrated a larger feedback-related negativity 
(FRN) to positive feedback than to negative feedback. In addition, SAD 
participants showed a more positive ΔFRN (ΔFRN = negative - positive). 
Furthermore, acceptance expectancy in daily life correlated negatively with ΔFRN 
amplitude, while the Interaction Anxiousness Scale (IAS) score correlated 
positively with the ΔFRN amplitude. Finally, the acceptance expectancy in daily 
life fully mediated the relationship between the IAS and ΔFRN. These results 
indicated that both groups could differentiate between positive and negative 
social feedback in the early stage of social feedback processing (reflected on 
the P2). However, the SAD group exhibited a larger FRN to positive social 
feedback than to negative social feedback, demonstrating their dysfunction in 
the late stage of social feedback processing. In our opinion, such dysfunction 
is due to their greater negative social feedback expectancy.

Targeted therapy and immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma have led to a marked 
improvement in patients' survival and their quality of life. Although there are 
data on anti-programmed-death-receptor-1 (anti-PD1) after ipilimumab, only few 
data are available on ipilimumab following anti-PD1 as the first-line treatment. 
The aim of our study was to evaluate tolerance and survival of patients treated 
with ipilimumab as the second-line immunotherapy among metastatic melanoma 
patients following anti-PD1 treatment. Retrospective and descriptive 
epidemiological studies were carried out at the Dermatology Department of the 
University Hospital of Lille. We describe a case series of patients treated with 
ipilimumab after anti-PD1 failure for metastatic melanomas. For each patient, we 
assessed disease extension since ipilimumab introduction using RECIST 1.1. The 
time between ipilimumab introduction and other systemic treatment and overall 
survival (between ipilimumab introduction and last patient visit) was assessed. 
The effect of ipilimumab after anti-PD1 treatment was evaluated in eight 
patients. Four patients responded to ipilimumab: three showed a complete 
response and one showed a partial response. For these patients, the time period 
between the first ipilimumab injection and another systemic treatment ranged 
from 209 to 391 days and the overall survival ranged from 314 to 581 days. One 
patient showed grade 3 chorioretinitis, an unusual toxicity with ipilimumab or 
anti-PD1 to our knowledge. We have described the efficacy of ipilimumab 
following anti-PD1 in metastatic melanoma in eight patients. Several comparative 
studies are still in progress, and their results will be important to develop an 
optimal therapeutic strategy for our patients.

OBJECT: This study sought to make a biomechanical comparison of 3 different 
posterior fixation techniques for 2-level lumbar spinal disorders.
METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen human cadaver lumbar spines (4 from L-1 to L-5, 4 
from L-1 to S-1) were tested by applying pure moments of ± 8 Nm. Each specimen 
was first tested intact, and then the left facetectomies of L3-4 and L4-5 were 
performed to establish an unstable condition without removal of discs. Three 
instrumentation systems were then tested randomly: unilateral pedicle screw 
(UPS), UPS with contralateral translaminar facet screw (UPSFS), and bilateral 
pedicle screw (BPS). The range of motion (ROM) and the neutral zone (NZ) of L3-5 
were measured.
RESULTS: All fixation types could reduce the ROM of L3-5 significantly in 
flexion, extension, and lateral bending, compared with the intact state. In 
axial torsion, only BPS reduced the ROM significantly, compared with the intact 
state. The UPSFS technique provided intermediate stability, which was superior 
to the UPS in flexion-extension and lateral bending, and inferior to the BPS in 
lateral bending. Compared with the intact state, the NZs decreased significantly 
for UPS, UPSFS, and BPS in flexion-extension, while not significantly in lateral 
bending and axial torsion.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, among the 3 fixation techniques, BPS offered the 
highest stability, UPSFS provided intermediate stability, and UPS was the least 
stable for 2-level lumbar spinal disorders. UPSFS appeared to be able to offer a 
less invasive choice than BPS in well-selected patients with 2-level lumbar 
spinal disorders.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most frequent monogenic disease in the 
Caucasian population, inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This is a 
multiple organ disease and its main manifestations include pulmonary and 
gastrointestinal dysfunction. The exocrine pancreatic deficiency results in 
impaired digestion and absorption what may lead to malnutrition and vitamins and 
minerals deficiencies. The life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients has been 
increasing over the past years, so there is a need to verify usefulness of 
existing or create new methods of nutritional status assessment. The aim of this 
paper was presentation current data on the methods of assessment and monitoring 
of nutritional status. Particular attention has been paid to appropriate 
nutritional support in prevention and treatment of malnutrition patients with 
cystic fibrosis. On the basis of recent literature we can conclude that the 
advanced nutritional status assessment is recommended in patient with CF by 
using anthropometrical methods, body composition analysis and biochemical data. 
Good nutritional status is connected with pulmonary functions, quality and life 
length.

Low Cloud Cover-Adjusted Ultraviolet B Irradiance Is Associated with High 
Incidence Rates of Leukemia: Study of 172 Countries.

There are 52,380 cases of leukemia and 24,090 deaths from it in the US annually. 
Its causes are unknown and no preventive strategies have been implemented. We 
hypothesized that leukemia is due mainly to vitamin D deficiency, which is due 
mainly to low solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance. To test this hypothesis, we 
estimated age-standardized cloud-cover-adjusted winter UVB irradiance using 
cloud cover data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, 
latitudes of population centroids, and standard astronomical calculations. 
Incidence rates for 172 countries, available from the International Agency for 
Cancer Research, were plotted according to cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance. We 
used multiple regression to account for national differences in elevation and 
average life expectancy. Leukemia incidence rates were inversely associated with 
cloud-adjusted UVB irradiance in males (p ≤ 0.01) and females (p ≤ 0.01) in both 
hemispheres. There were few departures from the trend line, which was parabolic 
when plotted with the equator at the center of the display, northern hemisphere 
countries on the right side and southern hemisphere countries on the left. The 
bivariate association displayed by the polynomial trend line indicated that 
populations at higher latitudes had at least two times the risk of leukemia 
compared to equatorial populations. The association persisted in males (p ≤ 
0.05) and females (p ≤ 0.01) after controlling for elevation and life 
expectancy. Incidence rates of leukemia were inversely associated with solar UVB 
irradiance. It is plausible that the association is due to vitamin D deficiency. 
This would be consistent with laboratory studies and a previous epidemiological 
study. Consideration should be given to prudent use of vitamin D for prevention 
of leukemia.

Humans age at different rates and families with exceptional survival provide the 
opportunity to understand why some people age slower than others. Unique 
features exhibited by centenarians include a family history of longevity, 
compression of morbidity with resultant extension of health span, and biomarkers 
such as low-circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and elevated 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Given the rarity of the 
centenarian phenotype, it has not been surprising that the use of discovery 
methods that relied on common population single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
to unlock the genetic determinants of exceptional longevity have not yielded 
significant results. Conversely, gene sequencing has resulted in discoveries of 
functional gene variants that support several of the centenarian phenotypes. 
These discoveries have led to the strategic developments of drugs that may delay 
aging and prolong health span.

Game of clones: the genomic evolution of severe congenital neutropenia.

Netherlands.

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a genetically heterogeneous condition of 
bone marrow failure usually diagnosed in early childhood and characterized by a 
chronic and severe shortage of neutrophils. It is now well-established that 
mutations in HAX1 and ELANE (and more rarely in other genes) are the genetic 
cause of SCN. In contrast, it has remained unclear how these mutations affect 
neutrophil development. Innovative models based on induced pluripotent stem cell 
technology are being explored to address this issue. These days, most SCN 
patients receive life-long treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(G-CSF, CSF3). CSF3 therapy has greatly improved the life expectancy of SCN 
patients, but also unveiled a high frequency of progression toward 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and therapy refractory acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). Expansion of hematopoietic clones with acquired mutations in the gene 
encoding the G-CSF receptor (CSF3R) is regularly seen in SCN patients and AML 
usually descends from one of these CSF3R mutant clones. These findings raised 
the questions how CSF3R mutations affect CSF3 responses of myeloid progenitors, 
how they contribute to the pre-leukemic state of SCN, and which additional 
events are responsible for progression to leukemia. The vast (sub)clonal 
heterogeneity of AML and the presence of AML-associated mutations in normally 
aged hematopoietic clones make it often difficult to determine which mutations 
are responsible for the leukemic process. Leukemia predisposition syndromes such 
as SCN are unique disease models to identify the sequential acquisition of these 
mutations and to interrogate how they contribute to clonal selection and 
leukemic evolution.

Managing older patients with hemophilia.

Angelini D(1), Sood SL(1).

Author information:
(1)Hemophilia and Coagulation Disorders Program, University of Michigan, Ann 
Arbor, MI.

With access to safe factor products, the life expectancy of persons with 
hemophilia (PWHs) has increased almost 10-fold over the past 7 decades. 
Unfortunately, hand in hand with this success comes the burden of aging. As PWHs 
age, they are subject to develop many of the same risk factors as the general 
population, including increasing rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. 
Such comorbidities predispose them to chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular 
disease and chronic kidney disease, although how their coagulopathy affects the 
expression of these conditions remains unclear. The older hemophilia population 
faces additional challenges, such as chronic joint arthropathy, which provokes 
falls and fractures, and complications related to HIV and hepatitis C 
infections, which greatly affect the incidence of cancer and liver disease. In 
light of the paucity of evidence-based guidelines to direct therapy, a new 
challenge has arisen for hematologists to optimally manage these complex 
age-related issues. In general, elderly PWHs should be treated similarly to 
their peers without hemophilia, with the addition of factor replacement therapy 
as appropriate. Primary prevention of risk factors should be emphasized, and 
close coordination between specialties is essential. This review will focus on 
common complications affecting the older hemophilia population, including 
cardiovascular disease, malignancy, liver disease, renal insufficiency, and 
joint disease.

BACKGROUND: The significant increase in the average life expectancy has 
increased the societal challenge of managing serious age-related diseases, 
especially cancer and cardiovascular diseases. A routine check by a general 
practitioner is not sufficient to detect incipient cardiovascular disease.
DESIGN: Population-based randomized clinically controlled screening trial.
PARTICIPANTS: 45,000 Danish men aged 65-74 years living on the Island of Funen, 
or in the surrounding communities of Vejle and Silkeborg. No exclusion criteria 
are used.
INTERVENTIONS: One-third will be invited to cardiovascular seven-faceted 
screening examinations at one of four locations. The screening will include: (1) 
low-dose non-contrast CT scan to detect coronary artery calcification and 
aortic/iliac aneurysms, (2) brachial and ankle blood pressure index to detect 
peripheral arterial disease and hypertension, (3) a telemetric assessment of the 
heart rhythm, and (4) a measurement of the cholesterol and plasma glucose 
levels. Up-to-date cardiovascular preventive treatment is recommended in case of 
positive findings.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether advanced cardiovascular screening will prevent 
death and cardiovascular events, and whether the possible health benefits are 
cost effective.
OUTCOME: Registry-based follow-up on all cause death (primary outcome), and 
costs after 3, 5 and 10 years (secondary outcome).
RANDOMIZATION: Each of the 45,000 individuals is, by EPIDATA, given a random 
number from 1-100. Those numbered 67+ will be offered screening; the others will 
act as a control group.
BLINDING: Only those randomized to the screening will be invited to the 
examination;the remaining participants will not. Numbers randomized: A total of 
45,000 men will be randomized 1:2. Recruitment: Enrollment started October 2014.
OUTCOME: A 5% reduction in overall mortality (HR=0.95), with the risk for a type 
1 error=5% and the risk for a type II error=80%, is expected. We expect a 2-year 
enrollment, a 10-year follow-up, and a median survival of 15 years among the 
controls. The attendance to screening is assumed to be 70%.
DISCUSSION: The primary aim of this so far stand-alone population-based, 
randomized trial will be to evaluate the health benefits and costeffectiveness 
of using non-contrast full truncus computer tomography (CT) scans (to measure 
coronary artery calcification (CAC) and identify aortic/iliac aneurysms) and 
measurements of the ankle brachial blood pressure index (ABI) as part of a 
multifocal screening and intervention program for CVD in men aged 65-74. 
Attendance rate and compliance to initiated preventive actions must be expected 
to become of major importance.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN12157806 (21 March 2015).

In the last decade, cardiac computed tomography (CT) has gained mainstream 
acceptance for the noninvasive exclusion of significant coronary disease in a 
selected population. Improvements in electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered imaging 
techniques also allow, by extension, a proper evaluation of the complete heart 
anatomy. Given the increasing worldwide clinical implementation of cardiac CT 
for coronary artery evaluation, radiologists can, incidentally, be confronted 
with unfamiliar and previously unsuspected non-coronary cardiac pathologies, 
including congenital morphological defects. This presence of congenital heart 
disease (CHD) should not be overlooked, being the most common form of birth 
defect, with a total birth prevalence of 9.1 per 1000 live births worldwide [1]. 
The prevalence of adult patients with CHD is estimated to be 3000 per million 
adults [2]. Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most frequent subtypes of 
CHD, accounting together with atrial septal defects (ASDs) for nearly half of 
all CHD cases [1]. While some small defects are rarely symptomatic and can go 
undetected for life, others are clinically significant and require adequate and 
timely medical intervention. In this article, we present the CT imaging features 
of atrioventricular (AV) shunts, highlighting both their embryological origins 
and associated relevant clinical features.
TEACHING POINTS: • Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth 
defect. • Ventricular and atrial septal defects account for nearly half of CHD 
cases. • Atrioventricular defects can frequently be detected on a cardiac CT. • 
Radiologists must be able to identify clinically significant atrioventricular 
defects.

INTRODUCTION: So far, the latest survey which used the EQ-5D questionnaire to 
measure the health status of the Hungarian population was carried out in 2000.
AIM: To explore the health state of the Hungarian population by 
socio-demographic characteristics, and to compare it with the results from 2000.
METHOD: As part of an international research project, a cross-sectional, online 
survey was carried out among the general population in 2010 using the EQ-5D-3L 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: In total, 2281 respondents (female: 62.3%) completed the questionnaire 
with an average age of 40.8 years. The EQ-5D score ranged from 0.902 (in 
age-group 18-24) to 0.795 (65+). The authors found significant association 
between the EQ-5D score and all the socio-demographic variables (gender, age, 
education, income) included in the regression model (F(4,1967)=35.12, p=0.000). 
The results did not differ significantly from the health survey in 2000, except 
for the youngest population group (age 18-24), where significantly lower scores 
were found in the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: While life expectance increased by 3 years between 2000 and 2010, 
the health status of the Hungarian population did not change significantly, and 
might even decreased among young adults in fact. Inequalities in health status 
by income and education remain significant. In international comparison, the 
health status of the Hungarian population remains among the worst ones.

A 66-year-old female presented with the main complaint of defecation trouble and 
abdominal distention. With diagnosis of rectal cancer, cSS, cN0, cH0, cP0, cM0 
cStage II, Hartmann's operation with D3 lymph node dissection was performed and 
a para-aortic lymph node and a disseminated node near the primary tumor were 
resected. Histological examination showed moderately differentiated 
adenocarcinoma, pSS, pN3, pH0, pP1, pM1 (para-aortic lymph node, dissemination) 
fStage IV. After the operation, the patient received chemotherapy with FOLFIRI 
regimen. After 12 cycles of FOLFIRI regimen, computed tomography (CT) detected 
an 11 mm of liver metastasis in the postero-inferior segment of right hepatic 
lobe. With diagnosis of liver metastatic recurrence, we performed partial 
hepatectomy. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated 
adenocarcinoma as a metastatic rectal cancer with cut end microscopically 
positive. After the second operation, the patient received chemotherapy with TS1 
alone for 2 years. Ten months after the break, CT detected a 20 mm of 
para-aortic lymph node metastasis and a 10 mm of lymph node metastasis at the 
hepato-duodenal ligament. With diagnosis of lymph node metastatic recurrences, 
we performed lymph node dissection. Histological examination revealed moderately 
differentiated adenocarcinoma as metastatic rectal cancer in para-aortic and 
hepato-duodenal ligament areas. After the third operation, we started 
chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen. After 2 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 
regimen, due to the onset of neutropenia and liver dysfunction, we switched to 
capecitabine alone and continued it for 6 mo and then stopped. Eleven months 
after the break, CT detected two swelling 12 mm of lymph nodes at the left 
supraclavicular region. With diagnosis of Virchow lymph node metastatic 
recurrence, we started chemotherapy with capecitabine plus bevacizumab regimen. 
Due to the onset of neutropenia and hand foot syndrome (Grade 3), we managed to 
continue capecitabine administration with extension of interval period and dose 
reduction. After 2 years and 2 mo from starting capecitabine plus bevacizumab 
regimen, Virchow lymph nodes had slowly grown up to 17 mm. Because no recurrence 
had been detected besides Virchow lymph nodes for this follow up period, 
considering the side effects and quality of life, surgical resection was 
selected. We performed left supraclavicular lymph node dissection. Histological 
examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma as a metastatic 
rectal cancer. After the fourth operation, the patient selected follow up 
without chemotherapy. Now we follow up her without recurrence and keep her 
quality of life high.

BACKGROUND: Cervical and lumbar range of motion limitations are usually 
associated with musculoskeletal pain in the neck and lower back, and are a major 
health problem among nurses. Physical exercise has been evaluated as an 
effective intervention method for improving cervical and lumbar range of motion, 
and for preventing and reducing musculoskeletal pain. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the effects of a home-exercise therapy programme on cervical 
and lumbar range of motion among intensive care unit nurses who had experienced 
mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain in the neck and or lower back during the 
previous six months.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted among intensive care unit 
nurses at Tartu University Hospital (Estonia) between May and July 2011. 
Thirteen nurses who had suffered musculoskeletal pain episodes in the neck and 
or lower back during the previous six months underwent an 8-week home-exercise 
therapy programme. Eleven nurses without musculoskeletal pain formed a control 
group. Questions from the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and the 11-point 
Visual Analogue Scale were used to select potential participants for the 
experimental group via an assessment of the prevalence and intensity of 
musculoskeletal pain. Cervical range of motion and lumbar range of motion in 
flexion, extension, lateral flexion and (cervical range of motion only) rotation 
were measured with a digital goniometer. A paired t-test was used to compare the 
measured parameters before and after the home-exercise therapy programme. A 
Student's t-test was used to analyse any differences between the experimental 
and control groups.
RESULTS: After the home-exercise therapy, there was a significant increase 
(p < 0.05) in cervical range of motion in flexion, extension, lateral flexion 
and rotation, and in lumbar range of motion in lateral flexion. Cervical range 
of motion in flexion was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the experimental 
group compared to the control group after therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an 8-week intensive home-exercise therapy 
programme may improve cervical and lumbar range of motion among intensive care 
nurses. Further studies are needed to develop this simple but effective 
home-exercise therapy programme to help motivate nurses to perform such 
exercises regularly.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of vortioxetine versus venlafaxine 
XR (extended-release) in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in South 
Korea.
METHODS: A 1-year cost-effectiveness analysis from a limited societal 
perspective was performed using a combined model consisting of a decision-tree 
and a Markov model. Patients entered the model when initiating or switching 
antidepressant treatment following inadequate response to previous treatment. 
Remission, relapse and recovery were the main health states.
RESULTS: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR, with quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gains of 0.0131 and cost savings of KRW 623,229/year [US$530/year] from a 
limited societal perspective. Safety contributed more than efficacy to the 
incremental QALY gains. More patients were in recovery after initial treatment 
and after 1 year with vortioxetine (31%, 40%) compared to venlafaxine XR (23%, 
36%). Vortioxetine remained dominant in 98% of probabilistic simulations.
CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR in South Korea and is a 
relevant treatment option for MDD patients initiating or switching therapy.

"Healthy Men" and High Mortality: Contributions from a Population-Based Study 
for the Gender Paradox Discussion.

Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Inequalities between men and women in morbidity and mortality show a 
contrast, which has been called gender paradox. Most studies evaluating this 
paradox were conducted in high-income countries and, until now, few 
investigations have been performed in Brazil. This study aims to estimate the 
magnitude of inequalities between adult men and women in several dimensions: 
demographic and socioeconomic, health behaviors, morbidity, use of health 
services and mortality.
METHODS: The data were obtained from population-based household survey carried
