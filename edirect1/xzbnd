the spring of 2012. They were approached in writing and requested to answer a 
few questions about the possibility of immediate discharge home for ICU patients 
with a short life expectancy and receiving palliative care.
RESULTS: A total of 46 surveys (52%) was returned from the 89 ICUs approached. 
Of these, 21 (46%) had discharged patients home at the request of the patient or 
their family so that the anticipated death could take place at home. Of the 
respondents, 39 (85%), supported discharge home for these patients, and 7 (15%) 
were opposed to it. These opinions were equally divided across all three ICU 
levels in the Netherlands. Higher-level ICUs had discharged patients home more 
often in comparison with lower-level ICUs (19%, 43% and 75% for levels 1, 2 and 
3, respectively). The preconditions for transfer can be subdivided into patient 
conditions, care conditions and general conditions.
CONCLUSION: ICU patients do sometimes want to die at home. It does not happen 
every day, but the wish is often granted in the Netherlands. There are certain 
general and patient-related conditions that have to be fulfilled. This article 
suggests a national guideline that could provide support on this subject.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors experience uncertainty about the future, which can 
be distressing. A prognostication tool is available for uveal melanoma 
survivors, which can provide accurate estimates of life expectancy - a key 
source of uncertainty. Accurate prognostic information has not previously been 
available for healthy cancer survivors. The aims of this study were to identify 
how patients experience prognostic information and how it affects their 
experience of uncertainty.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 healthy survivors of 
uveal melanoma 6-60 months after treatment (approximately 8-62 months after 
receiving prognostic information). Data were analysed qualitatively.
RESULTS: Patients did not feel that the prognostic information relieved 
uncertainty, which still overshadowed their lives. Different prognoses 
engendered different experiences of uncertainty. Those receiving poor life 
expectancy estimates reported uncertainties regarding the timing and form of 
metastases that they were likely to experience, but they also used uncertainty 
to justify feeling hopeful. Those receiving good prognoses were often unable 
wholly to accept these. Patients whose test results failed or were intermediate 
retained their original uncertainties. Patients managed their uncertainties by 
suppressing thoughts about them and by trusting in the care of clinicians and 
the health-care system.
CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty in the context of uveal melanoma is a complex and 
multifaceted experience that is not easily resolved by prognostication. 
Additional approaches are needed to help patients with the uncertainty that 
persists despite prognostication.

OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment reduces quality of life and is related to 
vascular and neurodegenerative disorders. However, there is also a close 
relationship between these diseases and oxidative stress. Thus, the purpose of 
this study was to assess whether inflammation and oxidative damage are 
associated with low cognitive performance in the elderly with different housing 
conditions.
METHODS: The study groups consisted of 32 institutionalized and 25 
noninstitutionalized Brazilian elderly subjects. Oxidative damage, inflammation 
markers, and cognitive function were evaluated.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated pronounced oxidative stress in the 
institutionalized elderly group, which also had a lower antioxidant status 
compared to noninstitutionalized subjects. High levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines were also observed in the institutionalized elderly. Furthermore, the 
raised levels of inflammatory markers were correlated with increased oxidative 
stress, and both were associated with low cognitive performance. However, based 
on multiple linear regression analysis, oxidative stress appears to be the main 
factor responsible for the cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that individuals with lower antioxidant status 
are more vulnerable to oxidative stress, which is associated with cognitive 
function, leading to reduced life quality and expectancy.

BACKGROUND: To increase the survival span after dialysis in patients with 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), identifying specific cancer risks is crucial in 
the cancer screening of these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the risks of various cancers in an incident dialysis group in comparison with a 
non-dialysis group.
METHOD: We conducted a nationwide cohort study by using data from the Taiwan 
National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who initially received 
long-term dialysis between January 1997 and December 2004, were selected and 
defined as the dialysis group and were matched with the non-dialysis patients 
(control group) according to age, sex, and index year. Competing risk analysis 
was used to estimate cumulative incidence and subdistribution hazard ratios 
(SHRs) of the first cancer occurrence.
RESULTS: After consideration for the competing risk of mortality, the dialysis 
group showed a significantly higher 7-year cancer incidence rate than did the 
control group (6.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0%-6.7% vs 1.7%; 95% CI, 
1.4%-2.1%; P <0.001).The modified Cox proportional hazard model revealed that 
the dialysis group had significantly association with increased risks for all 
cancers (SHR, 3.43; 95% CI, 3.02-3.88). The risk of cancers was dominated in 
younger and female patients. Specific cancer risks were significantly higher in 
the dialysis group particularly in the development of oral, colorectal, liver, 
blood, breast, renal, upper urinary tract, and bladder cancer than in the 
control group. Multivariable stratified analyses confirmed the association 
between long-term dialysis and cancer in all subgroups of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis is associated with a higher risk of cancer in patients 
with ESRD. However, cancer screening in ESRD population should be a selective 
approach, based on individual patient health condition and life expectancy.

The life and significance of Charles Lucas (1713-1771).

JAMES.KELLY@SPD.DCU.IE.

Charles Lucas (1713-1771) was one of the most controversial popular politicians 
to stride the Irish political stage in the eighteenth century. Though the 
descendant of a beneficiary of the Cromwellian plantation, Lucas's personal 
inheritance was small, and he was apprenticed in his teens to an apothecary in 
Dublin. Lucas prospered in that capacity, both as an advocate of higher 
standards within the profession, and as a representative on the lower house (the 
common council) of Dublin Corporation. Predisposed to challenge what he 
perceived as abuses by vested and established interests, Lucas made a name for 
himself as an outspoken critic of the oligarchical pretensions of the lord mayor 
and aldermen, which comprised the upper chamber of the Corporation. His 
successes were few, but he was possessed of a fluent pen, and a precocious 
awareness that he could best communicate with his natural audience through the 
use of print. As a result, he became the darling of an emerging popular 
political interest, which shared his vision of a reformed Protestant 
constitution. Encouraged by this positive response, Lucas offered himself to the 
electorate of Dublin in 1749, but though he campaigned vigorously, and polled 
well, he was not elected. More consequently for Lucas personally, his extension 
of his critical gaze from the municipality to the larger canvas of national and 
Anglo-Irish politics elicited the hostile notice of the most powerful figures in 
the land, which prompted him to flee the country to avoid imprisonment. Lucas 
was not inactive during his eleven-year 'exile', but these were comparatively 
quiet years by comparison with his final decade when, following his return to 
Ireland in 1761, he acquired a national profile as MP for Dublin City, a 
vigorous advocate, and a tireless proponent of Patriot policies.

BACKGROUND: Oral ulcers, the hallmark of Behçet's syndrome, can be resistant to 
conventional treatment; therefore, alternative agents are needed. Apremilast is 
an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that modulates several inflammatory 
pathways.
METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in which 
111 patients with Behçet's syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were 
randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for 12 
weeks. This regimen was followed by a 12-week extension phase in which the 
placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28-day post-treatment 
observational follow-up phase. The patients and clinicians were unaware of the 
study assignments throughout the trial. The primary end point was the number of 
oral ulcers at week 12. Secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers 
(measured on a 100-mm visual-analogue scale, with higher scores indicating worse 
pain), the number of genital ulcers, overall disease activity, and quality of 
life.
RESULTS: The mean (±SD) number of oral ulcers per patient at week 12 was 
significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group (0.5±1.0 
vs. 2.1±2.6) (P<0.001). The mean decline in pain from oral ulcers from baseline 
to week 12 was greater with apremilast than with placebo (-44.7±24.3 mm vs. 
-16.0±32.5 mm) (P<0.001). Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were more common in the 
apremilast group (with 22, 9, and 12 incidents, respectively, among 55 patients) 
than in the placebo group (with 10, 1, and 2 incidents, respectively, among 56 
patients), findings that were similar to those in previous studies of 
apremilast. There were two serious adverse events in patients receiving 
apremilast.
CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast was effective in treating oral ulcers, which are the 
cardinal manifestation of Behçet's syndrome. This preliminary study was neither 
large enough nor long enough to assess long-term efficacy, the effect on other 
manifestations of Behçet's syndrome, or the risk of uncommon serious adverse 
events. (Funded by Celgene; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00866359.).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease that can 
cause painful swelling in the joint lining, morning stiffness, and joint 
deformation/destruction. These symptoms decrease both quality of life and life 
expectancy. However, if RA can be diagnosed in the early stages, it can be 
controlled with pharmacotherapy. Although many studies have examined the 
possibility of early assessment and diagnosis, few have considered the 
relationship between significant risk factors and the early assessment of RA. In 
this paper, we present a novel framework for early RA assessment that utilizes 
data preprocessing, risk pattern mining, validation, and analysis. Under our 
proposed framework, two risk patterns can be discovered. Type I refers to 
well-known risk patterns that have been identified by existing studies, whereas 
Type II denotes unknown relationship risk patterns that have rarely or never 
been reported in the literature. These Type II patterns are very valuable in 
supporting novel hypotheses in clinical trials of RA, and constitute the main 
contribution of this work. To ensure the robustness of our experimental 
evaluation, we use a nationwide clinical database containing information on 
1,314 RA-diagnosed patients over a 12-year follow-up period (1997-2008) and 
965,279 non-RA patients. Our proposed framework is employed on this large-scale 
population-based dataset, and is shown to effectively discover rich RA risk 
patterns. These patterns may assist physicians in patient assessment, and 
enhance opportunities for early detection of RA. The proposed framework is 
broadly applicable to the mining of risk patterns for major disease assessments. 
This enables the identification of early risk patterns that are significantly 
associated with a target disease.

Women's health, HIV/AIDS and the workplace in South Africa.

Sprague C.

This work explores the connections between gender inequality, HIV/AIDS and 
women's health in the world of work in South Africa. These connections are 
located within a context of significant reversals in development, specifically 
declining life expectancy and premature mortality for South Africans - 
particularly for women. By relying on the existing literature and interviews 
with 33 key informants, the paper examines the extent to which South African 
workplaces are recognising women's social and biological vulnerability to HIV. 
In particular, the paper considers the potential role of the workplace in 
responding to growing evidence that links gender and health by establishing 
targeted HIV/AIDS interventions. The findings suggest that the vast majority of 
company representatives do not recognise women's social and biological 
vulnerability and related social norms vis-à-vis HIV and AIDS. Importantly, most 
workplaces are not initiating programmes that specifically address women's or 
men's health. The author briefly identifies factors that may help explain the 
current state of knowledge and practice in the realm of HIV and women's health 
in the workplace, and puts forward suggestions for future research.

Ministry of Education, Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the gender difference in life expectancy in Chinese urban 
people and explore the age-specific and cause-specific contributions to the 
changing gender differences in life expectancy.
METHODS: Data of life expectancy and mortality were obtained from "Annual 
statistics of public health in China." The gender difference was analyzed by 
decomposition method, including age-specific decomposition and cause-specific 
decomposition.
RESULTS: Women lived much longer than men in Chinese urban areas, with 
remarkable gains in life expectancy since 2005, respectively. The gender 
difference reached a peak in 2007. Mortality difference between men and women in 
the 60-79 age group made the largest contributions to the gender gap in life 
expectancy in all 6 years. Among causes of death, cancers, circulatory diseases 
and respiratory diseases made the largest contributions to the gender gap. 
33-38% of the gender gap were caused by cancers, among which lung cancer 
contributed 0.6 years of the overall gap. The contribution of cancers to the 
gender gap reduced over time, mostly influenced by the narrowing effect of liver 
cancer on gender gap. Traffic accidents and suicide were the external causes 
influencing the gender gap, contributing 10-16% of the overall difference.
CONCLUSION: Public health efforts to reduce excess mortalities for cancers, 
circulatory disease, respiratory diseases, and suicide among men in particular 
might further narrow the gender gap in life expectancy in Chinese cities.

Recently a few vocal health experts have suggested that some of the billions of 
dollars currently used to prevent and treat HIV and AIDS be reallocated to 
address more basic problems such as malnutrition, tuberculosis, malaria, and 
enteric and diarrheal disease caused by lack of access to clean water. While not 
universally agreed upon, this reassessment of policy priorities acknowledges 
that there are multiple other health problems that deserve renewed attention 
from the international community. It also highlights the fact that the impacts 
of the HIV pandemic are exacerbated by widespread poverty, food insecurity and 
malnutrition, and gender inequality. Nowhere is this more evident than in 
sub-Saharan Africa, where multiple epidemics conflate and seriously compromise 
the survival of individuals and communities. Given the widespread occurrence of 
famine in sub-Saharan Africa, issues of food and economic security become of 
paramount importance in efforts to address the region's HIV epidemics. This 
paper examines the historical, political-economic, and cultural dimensions of 
the HIV epidemic in the context of the growing problem of food and economic 
insecurity. Furthermore, using theoretical frameworks that emphasize the dynamic 
interrelation between HIV/AIDS and food insecurity, we present suggestions for 
combining traditional HIV-prevention strategies with food production and 
nutritioneducation programming. In light of the complex interactions between 
HIV/AIDS and food insecurity and the lack of accessible treatment modalities, 
such programming could potentially reduce the risk for transmission of HIV 
through behavioural changes and improved nutritional and immune status, and 
increase the life expectancy of people living with HIV or AIDS.

Counterintuitively, faster increases in human life expectancy could lead to 
slower population aging. The conventional view that faster increases in human 
life expectancy would lead to faster population aging is based on the assumption 
that people become old at a fixed chronological age. A preferable alternative is 
to base measures of aging on people's time left to death, because this is more 
closely related to the characteristics that are associated with old age. Using 
this alternative interpretation, we show that faster increases in life 
expectancy would lead to slower population aging. Among other things, this 
finding affects the assessment of the speed at which countries will age.

BACKGROUND: The first estimates of Healthy Life Years at age 50 (HLY50) across 
the EU25 countries in 2005 showed substantial variation in healthy ageing. We 
investigate whether factors contributing to HLY50 inequalities have changed 
between 2005 and 2010.
METHODS: HLY50 for each country and year were calculated using Sullivan's 
method, applying the age-specific prevalence of activity limitation from the 
European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey to 
life tables. Inequalities in life expectancy at age 50 (LE50) and HLY50 between 
countries were defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum LE50 or 
HLY50. Relationships between HLY50 and macro-level socio-economic indicators 
were investigated using meta-regression. Men and women were analysed separately.
RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2010 HLY50 inequalities for both men and women in 
Europe increased. In 2005 and 2010 HLY50 inequalities exceeded LE50 
inequalities, particularly in the established EU15 countries in 2010 where HLY50 
inequalities (men: 10.7 years; women: 12.5 years) were four times greater for 
men and three times for women than LE50 inequalities (men: 2.4 years; women: 4.1 
years). Only material deprivation significantly explained variation in EU25 
HLY50 in both years with, additionally, long-term unemployment in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that inequalities in HLY50 across Europe are 
large, increasing and partly explained by levels of material deprivation. 
Moreover long-term unemployment has become more influential in explaining 
variation in HLY50 between 2005 and 2010.

Current Trends in Health Insurance Systems: OECD Countries vs. Japan.

Sasaki T, Izawa M, Okada Y.

Republished from
    Neurol Med Chir (Tokyo). 2015;55(4):267-75.

Over the past few decades, the longest extension in life expectancy in the world 
has been observed in Japan. However, the sophistication of medical care and the 
expansion of the aging society, leads to continuous increase in health-care 
costs. Medical expenses as a part of gross domestic product (GDP) in Japan are 
exceeding the current Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) average, challenging the universally, equally provided low cost health 
care existing in the past. A universal health insurance system is becoming a 
common system currently in developed countries, currently a similar system is 
being introduced in the United States. Medical care in Japan is under a social 
insurance system, but the injection of public funds for medical costs becomes 
very expensive for the Japanese society. In spite of some urgently decided 
measures to cover the high cost of advanced medical treatment, declining 
birthrate and aging population and the tendency to reduce hospital and 
outpatients’ visits numbers and shorten hospital stays, medical expenses of 
Japan continue to be increasing.

BACKGROUND: In clinical studies, treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 
(IFNβ-1a) has been shown to reduce relapse rates and slow the progression of 
physical disability in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). 
A formulation of subcutaneous IFNβ-1a has been developed that is free of fetal 
bovine serum and human serum albumin.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate (a) the impact on quality of life (QoL) and treatment 
satisfaction of transitioning from the original formulation of subcutaneous 
IFNβ-1a to the serum-free formulation in patients with relapsing forms of MS; 
and (b) the impact of dose titration versus non-titration during the transition 
on tolerability and patterns of analgesic use. QoL was measured by the Multiple 
Sclerosis Treatment Concerns Questionnaire Global Side Effects (GSE) score.
METHODS: Patients who had received the original formulation of IFNβ-1a 
subcutaneously for ≥24 weeks were randomized to receive the serum-free 
formulation of IFNβ-1a 44μg subcutaneously three times weekly for 12 weeks, with 
or without a dose titration over a 4-week period. After week 12, patients 
continued to receive serum-free subcutaneous IFNβ-1a during a safety extension 
phase until they completed between 84 and 112 weeks of treatment. The primary 
endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to week 12 in GSE score in all 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 232 patients were randomized (titrated n=113; non-titrated 
n=119). The mean percent change (improvement) from baseline to week 12 in the 
GSE score was 5.0% (p<0.001 for mean change in GSE score from baseline); this 
change was similar between titrated and non-titrated patients and met criteria 
for non-inferiority to the original formulation. Adverse event (AE) incidence 
and use of analgesics for the treatment of flu-like symptoms (FLS) were less 
common in the titrated group. Few patients (<2%) discontinued due to AEs during 
weeks 0 to 12.
CONCLUSION: Patients with relapsing forms of MS who transitioned from 
original-formulation subcutaneous IFNβ-1a to serum-free subcutaneous IFNβ-1a had 
overall improved QoL scores at 12 weeks of treatment. Titration during the 
transition resulted in a lower requirement for analgesic treatment of FLS and 
fewer AEs.

Frontline rituximab monotherapy induction versus a watch and wait approach for 
asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: A watch and wait (WW) strategy is the standard of care for patients 
with asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma. Recent data have 
demonstrated an improvement in the time to progression with rituximab induction 
(RI) with or without rituximab maintenance (RM) in comparison with a WW strategy 
wait in such patients. It remains unclear whether this is a cost-effective 
strategy.
METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare the clinical 
outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of RI (4 weekly doses) plus RM (12 doses 
every 2 months), RI (4 weekly doses), and a WW strategy for patients newly 
diagnosed with low-burden, asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular lymphoma over 
a lifetime horizon. Baseline probabilities and utilities were derived from a 
systematic review of published studies, and they were evaluated on a 6-month 
cycle. A Canadian public health payer's perspective was adopted, and costs were 
presented in 2012 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: RI was the cheapest strategy. It was less costly at $59,953 versus 
$67,489 for the RM arm and $75,895 for the WW arm. It was also associated with a 
slightly lower quality-adjusted life expectancy at 6.16 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) versus 6.28 QALYs for the RM strategy but was superior to WW (5.71 
QALYs). In sensitivity analyses of key variables, this effectiveness was 
sensitive to the probability of first and second progression in the RI arm, and 
this indicated relatively neutral effectiveness between the 2 rituximab arms.
CONCLUSIONS: RI without maintenance for asymptomatic advanced-stage follicular 
lymphoma is the preferred strategy: it minimizes costs per patient over a 
lifetime horizon.

Our recent Accretion Model of ribosomal evolution uses insertion fingerprints 
and a "trunk-branch" formalism to recapitulate the building up of common core 
rRNA of the Large Ribosomal Subunit. The Accretion Model is a conservative and 
natural extension of a method developed by Bokov and Steinberg (Nature 
457:977-80, 2009), which confirms the correctness of lower resolution models by 
Fox and others. In each of these models, the LSU originates with the peptidyl 
transferase center (PTC), consistent with expectations that the ribosome is the 
source of defined-sequence functional proteins. In an adjacent note, 
Caetano-Anolles (J Mol Evol 80:162-165, 2015) disparages the Accretion Model, 
because it controverts the 'Growth Inferred by Genothermal Ordering' 
(GIGO) model. GIGO analyzes secondary structures, assigns the origin of the 
ribosome to a region outside of the PTC, and assumes or deduces that (i) large 
protein enzymes of defined amino acid sequence predate ribosomal synthesis of 
proteins, (ii) proteins directly replicate by non-ribosomal mechanisms, (iii) 
rRNA unfailingly increases in thermodynamic stability over time, and (iv) the 
Woese and Fox canonical tree of life is mis-rooted. Much of the specific GIGO 
critique of the Accretion Model is based on confusion about the 
three-dimensional nature of RNA and trunk-branch polymorphism; the Accretion 
Model incorporates several types of trunk-branch relationships.

OBJECTIVE: The multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) blood test has been 
clinically validated as a measure of disease activity in patients with RA. We 
aimed to estimate the effect of the MBDA test on physical function for patients 
with RA (based on HAQ), quality-adjusted life years and costs over 10 years.
METHODS: A decision analysis was conducted to quantify the effect of using the 
MBDA test on RA-related outcomes and costs to private payers and employers. 
Results of a clinical management study reporting changes to anti-rheumatic drug 
recommendations after use of the MBDA test informed clinical utility. The effect 
of treatment changes on HAQ was derived from 5 tight-control and 13 
treatment-switch trials. Baseline HAQ scores and the HAQ score relationship with 
medical costs and quality of life were derived from published National Data Bank 
for Rheumatic Diseases data.
RESULTS: Use of the MBDA test is projected to improve HAQ scores by 0.09 units 
in year 1, declining to 0.02 units after 10 years. Over the 10 year time 
horizon, quality-adjusted life years increased by 0.08 years and costs decreased 
by US$457 (cost savings in disability-related medical costs, US$659; in 
productivity costs, US$2137). The most influential variable in the analysis was 
the effect of the MBDA test on clinician treatment recommendations and 
subsequent HAQ changes.
CONCLUSION: The MBDA test aids in the assessment of disease activity in patients 
with RA by changing treatment decisions, improving the functional status of 
patients and cost savings. Further validation is ongoing and future longitudinal 
studies are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: There is increasing interest in the survival of multiple sclerosis 
(MS). MS itself may decrease life expectancy; however, several other comorbid 
diseases may also influence survival. We aimed to evaluate frequency of other 
neurological conditions and survival in the population-based Finnish Northern 
Ostrobothnia MS cohort.
METHODS: The frequencies of neurological comorbid diseases and their 
associations with gender, clinical course, disability level (EDSS) and duration 
of MS were evaluated in population based cohort of 491 patients with clinically 
definite MS that was diagnosed between 1990 and 2010. The survival rate of the 
patients was also analysed.
RESULTS: One or more neurological comorbid disease was present in 17.1% of 
patients (n=84). The prevalence of epilepsy in MS patients was 4.7%, which is 
greater than that in the general population. Migraine was significantly more 
common in women with a benign MS course when compared to other types of MS 
(p=0.046). A significant association between peripheral nervous system disorders 
and primary progressive MS was found (p=0.027). The 21-year survival rate from 
time of diagnosis was 90.5%. Stroke decreased the 21-year survival rate of the 
patients (p=0.003). An association between stroke prevalence and the duration of 
MS disease was also detected (p=0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of multifaceted neurological comorbidities 
in MS patients. Neurological comorbidity is rather common in MS. However, only 
the prevalence of epilepsy was increased in MS patients compared to the general 
population. An association between peripheral nervous system disorders and 
primary progressive MS was also found. The 21-year survival rate was greater in 
the present population based cohort compared in other studies, but stroke seems 
to decrease the survival rate in MS patients.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Chloroplast development and structure are highly conserved 
in vascular plants, but the bizonoplast of Selaginella is a notable exception. 
In the shade plant S. erythropus, each dorsal epidermal cell contains one 
bizonoplast, while other cells have normal chloroplasts. Our quest was to (1) 
determine the origin of bizonoplasts, (2) explore developmental plasticity, and 
(3) correlate developmental changes with photosynthetic activity to provide 
insights unavailable in other green plants with more constrained development.•
METHODS: Bizonoplast development was studied in juvenile prostrate and older 
erect shoots of S. erythropus. Plastid plasticity was studied in plants 
cultivated under different light conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence was 
measured and correlated with photosynthetic activity.•
KEY RESULTS: The bizonoplast originates from a proplastid, forming a distinctive 
upper zone rapidly after exposure to low light. In the prostrate shoots, the 
proplastid develops through early stages only. When the shoot becomes erect, the 
proplastid soon develops into a mature bizonoplast. Erect shoots have 
significantly higher photosynthetic efficiency than prostrate shoots. No 
bizonoplasts were found in the plants growing in high light, where 2-4 
spheroidal chloroplasts formed, or with light from below.•
CONCLUSIONS: The upper zone develops above a normal-looking chloroplast 
structure to produce a bizonoplast. Bizonoplast developmental plasticity 
suggests that regular lamellar structure and monoplastidy are adaptations to 
deep shade environments. Such novel variation in S. erythropus is in stark 
contrast to known plastid development in other vascular plants, possibly 
reflecting retention of developmental flexibility in the basal clade, Lycophyta, 
to which it belongs.

Age trajectories of mortality from all diseases in five countries of central 
Europe during the last decades.

Králové , Hradec Králové , Czech Republic.

Age trajectories of total mortality represent an irreplaceable source of 
information about the relationship between mortality and age. Total mortality 
includes death from external causes. Age affects mortality from all diseases 
differently than it affects mortality from external causes. This study examines 
mortality with external causes excluded. The resulting category of all-diseases 
is examined as a helpful tool to better understand the relationship between 
mortality and age. Age trajectories of all-diseases mortality are studied in 
Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. Resulting age 
trajectories of all-diseases mortality show a strong minimum that is hidden in 
all-causes mortality. Two deterministic models fit the resulting age 
trajectories of mortality on either side of the strong mortality minimum. The 
inverse proportion between mortality and age is used from birth to the age when 
all-diseases mortality reaches the minimum value. The Gompertz relationship fits 
age trajectories of all-diseases mortality in 93 out of 183 cases. When extended 
with a small quadratic element, the Gompertz model is used to fit the remaining 
90 cases.

Genetic studies indicate that aging is modulated by a great number of genetic 
pathways. We have used Drosophila longevity and stress assays to test a 
multipath intervention strategy. To carry out this strategy, we supplemented the 
flies with herbal extracts (SC100) that are predicted to modulate the expression 
of many genes involved in aging and stress resistance, such as mTOR, NOS, 
NF-KappaB, and VEGF. When flies were housed in large cages with SC100 added, 
daily mortality rates of both male and female flies were greatly diminished in 
mid to late life. Surprisingly, SC100 also stabilized midlife mortality rate 
increases so as to extend the maximum life span substantially beyond the limits 
previously reported for D. melanogaster. Under these conditions, SC100 also 
promoted robust resistance to partial starvation stress and to heat stress. 
Fertility was the same initially in both treated and control flies, but it 
became significantly higher in treated flies at older ages as the fertility of 
control flies declined. Mean and maximum life spans of flies in vials at the 
same test site were also extended by SC100, but the life spans were short in 
absolute terms. In contrast, at an independent test site where stress was 
minimized, the flies exhibited much longer mean life spans, but the survival 
curves became highly rectangular and the effects of SC100 on both mean and 
maximum life spans declined greatly or were abolished. The data indicate that 
SC100 is a novel herbal mix with striking effects on enhancing Drosophila stress 
resistance and life span in some environments, while minimizing mid to late life 
mortality rates. They also show that the environment and other factors can have 
transformative effects on both the length and distribution of survivorship, and 
on the ability of SC100 to extend the life span.
