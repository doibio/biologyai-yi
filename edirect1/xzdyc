Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) are rare heterogenous genetic conditions. 
Advanced technology and novel therapeutic developments have led to the improved 
life expectancy of patients with IMDs. Long-term, they require close 
surveillance from specialist adult metabolic providers. Healthcare transition 
(HCT) is the planned, purposeful process of preparing adolescents for 
adult-centered medical care and has been recognized globally as a necessary 
component of care for IMDs. Two recent surveys outlined barriers to the HCT in 
the US and the UK. The limited knowledge of IMDs among adult physicians was one 
of the barriers. Some work on specialty curriculum has started and aims to 
improve the structured training and awareness of rare diseases. Other barriers 
included social and legal aspects of adulthood, social, vocational and 
educational support for young adults, care fragmentation and insurance coverage. 
Although various HCT tools are available, they cannot always be standardized for 
IMDs. Despite the remarkable differences in the healthcare systems and 
physicians' training, collaboration among metabolic centers is possible. 
International rare disease alliance may enhance the patients' management via 
guidelines development and standardized training for adult metabolic providers.

Aging is characterized by an imbalance between damage inflicted by reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidative defenses of the organism. As a 
significant nutritional factor, the trace element selenium (Se) may remodel 
gradual and spontaneous physiological changes caused by oxidative stress, 
potentially leading to disease prevention and healthy aging. Se is involved in 
improving antioxidant defense, immune functions, and metabolic homeostasis. An 
inadequate Se status may reduce human life expectancy by accelerating the aging 
process or increasing vulnerability to various disorders, including immunity 
dysfunction, and cancer risk. This review highlights the available studies on 
the effective role of Se in aging mechanisms and shows the potential clinical 
implications related to its consumption. The main sources of organic Se and the 
advantages of its nanoformulations were also discussed.

Although branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are known to stimulate myofibrillar 
protein synthesis and affect insulin signaling and kynurenine metabolism (the 
latter being a metabolite of tryptophan associated with depression and 
dementia), the effects of BCAA supplementation on type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not 
clear. Therefore, a 24-week, prospective randomized open blinded-endpoint trial 
was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplementation of 8 g of BCAA or 7.5 g 
of soy protein on skeletal muscle and glycemic control as well as adverse events 
in elderly individuals with T2D. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned 
to the BCAA group (n = 21) and the soy protein group (n = 15). Skeletal muscle 
mass and HbA1c, which were primary endpoints, did not change over time or differ 
between groups. However, knee extension muscle strength was significantly 
increased in the soy protein group and showed a tendency to increase in the BCAA 
group. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance did not significantly 
change during the trial. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved in the 
BCAA group but the difference between groups was not significant. Results 
suggested that BCAA supplementation may not affect skeletal muscle mass and 
glycemic control and may improve depressive symptoms in elderly individuals with 
T2D.

From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate of nutritional 
deficiencies in China remained stable. However, the age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) rate of nutritional deficiencies decreased 
from 1990 to 2019. Data were extracted from the GBD 2019 datasets. Estimated 
annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess the incidence rate, 
and DALY trends of nutritional deficiencies. Measures were stratified by 
subtypes, regions, and age groups. In 2019, the age-standardized DALY rates of 
dietary iron deficiency and protein-energy malnutrition reached their highest 
levels. The main population groups with protein-energy malnutrition and dietary 
iron deficiency were adults over the age of 70 and children under the age of 
five. The latter group also had a greater burden of vitamin A deficiency. 
Zhejiang, Beijing, and Guangdong reported the highest age-standardized incidence 
rates of nutritional deficiencies, which mainly pertained to protein-energy 
malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hainan had the 
highest age-standardized DALY rates of nutritional deficiencies, which mainly 
pertained to dietary iron deficiency and protein-energy malnutrition.

Queen bee larva (QBL) is one kind of important edible insect that is harvested 
during royal jelly production process. QBL has many physiological functions; 
however, limited information is available regarding its antiaging effects. In 
this study, the antiaging function of freeze-dried QBL powder (QBLP) was 
investigated by combining the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model and 
transcriptomics. The administration of QBLP to C. elegans was shown to improve 
lifespan parameters. Additionally, QBLP improved the mobility of nematodes. 
Transcriptome analysis showed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
significantly enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms that were almost all related 
to the biological functions of cell metabolism and stress, which are associated 
with lifespan. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis 
suggested that the lifespan of C. elegans was related to the longevity 
regulating pathway-worm. The expression levels of the key genes sod-3, gst-6, 
hsp-12.6, lips-7, ins-8, and lips-17 were upregulated. sod-3, hsp-12.6, lips-7, 
and lips-17 are downstream targets of DAF-16, which is an important 
transcription factor related to lifespan extension. CF1038 (daf-16(mu86)) 
supplemented with QBLP did not show a life-prolonging. This indicates that the 
antiaging function of QBLP is closely related to daf-16. Thus, QBLP is a 
component that could potentially be used as a functional material to ameliorate 
aging and aging-related symptoms.

Recent activities in the oil and gas industry have shown an increasing need for 
monitoring engagements, such as in shipping, logistics, exploration, drilling, 
or production. Hence, there is a need to have asset management of these offshore 
assets (or facilities). Much of the offshore infrastructure is currently 
approaching or past its operational life expectancy. The study presents an 
overview on asset management of offshore facilities towards monitoring, safe 
practices, maintenance, and sustainability. This study outlines the major 
considerations and the steps to take when evaluating asset life extensions for 
an aging offshore structure (or asset). The design and construction of offshore 
structures require some materials that are used to make the structural units, 
such as offshore platform rigs, ships, and boats. Maintaining existing assets in 
the field and developing new platforms that are capable of extracting future oil 
and gas resources are the two key issues facing the offshore sector. This paper 
also discusses fault diagnosis using sensors in the offshore facilities. The 
ocean environment is constantly corrosive, and the production activities demand 
extremely high levels of safety and reliability. Due to the limited space and 
remote location of most offshore operations, producing cost-effective, 
efficient, and long-lasting equipment necessitates a high level of competence. 
This paper presents the guidelines on asset monitoring, sustainable maintenance, 
and safety practices for offshore structures. In this study, the management of 
offshore structures were also presented with some discussions on fault 
monitoring using sensors. It also proposes sustainable asset management 
approaches as guidelines that are advised, with policy implications.

Acromegaly is described as the oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) and, 
subsequently, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), ascribed in most cases to a 
pituitary adenoma. This disease presents a progressive disfigurement, along with 
other systemic manifestations, which altogether diminishes the quality of life 
in the patients. Prolonged exposure to abnormally high levels of GH and IGF-1 
levels results in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and pulmonary dysfunction 
which overall produces a fall in life expectancy. Timely diagnosis and further 
treatment decreased the mortality rate of the patients and showed an improvement 
in the quality of life. Surgical procedures, advanced radiation therapy tools, 
and the availability of pharmacological compounds that act on pituitary growth 
hormone-producing cells have enabled an improved approach to treating the 
disease. Pharmacological treatment is currently an important management option, 
and it may also be the first-line treatment in patients with acromegaly who do 
not benefit from or are ineligible for first-line surgical procedures. From its 
inception until 2021, we used a comprehensive search strategy on Medline/PubMed, 
Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library electronic databases. 
All human research articles and review articles published in English were 
considered for the review. In this review, we describe the clinical implications 
and management of patients with acromegaly, consisting of scientific 
improvements underlying the developing understanding of pathogenesis and 
diagnosis, associated comorbidities and mortality rate with the disease, and 
major improvements in the treatment of the disease, along with novel strategies 
including quality of life and patient-reported outcomes.

Phosphoinositide metabolism is critically involved in human cancer cell 
migration and metastatic growth. The formation of lamellipodia at the leading 
edge of migrating cells is regulated by metabolism of the inositol phospholipid 
PI(4,5)P2 into PI(3,4,5)P3. The synthesized PI(3,4,5)P3 promotes the 
translocation of WASP family verprolin homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to the 
plasma membrane and regulates guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rac-mediated 
actin filament remodeling. Here, we investigated if VIPR2, a receptor for 
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), has a potential role in regulating cell 
migration via this pathway. We found that silencing of VIPR2 in MDA-MB-231 and 
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells inhibited VIP-induced cell migration. In 
contrast, stable expression of exogenous VIPR2 promoted VIP-induced tumor cell 
migration, an effect that was inhibited by the addition of a PI3-kinase (PI3K)Œ≥ 
inhibitor or a VIPR2-selective antagonist. VIPR2 stably-expressing cells 
exhibited increased PI3K activity. Membrane localization of PI(3,4,5)P3 was 
significantly attenuated by VIPR2-silencing. VIPR2-silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells 
suppressed lamellipodium extension; in VIPR2-overexpressing cells, VIPR2 
accumulated in the cell membrane on lamellipodia and co-localized with WAVE2. 
Conversely, VIPR2-silencing reduced WAVE2 level on the cell membrane and 
inhibited the interaction between WAVE2, actin-related protein 3, and actin. 
These findings suggest that VIP-VIPR2 signaling controls cancer migration by 
regulating WAVE2-mediated actin nucleation and elongation for lamellipodium 
formation through the synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P3.

Because of the scarcity of caregivers and the high cost of medical devices, it 
is difficult to keep track of the aging population and provide assistance. To 
avoid deterioration of health issues, continuous monitoring of personal health 
should be done prior to the intervention. If a problem is discovered, the IoT 
platform collects and presents the caretaker with graphical data. The death 
rates of older patients are reduced when projections are made ahead of time. 
Patients can die as a result of minor abnormalities in their ECG. The cardiac 
dysrhythmia/irregular heart rate is classified with several multilayer 
parameters using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach in this 
paper. The key benefit of utilizing this CNN approach is that it can handle 
databases that have been purposefully oversampled. Using the XGBoost approach, 
these are oversampled to deal with difficulties like minority class and 
imbalance. XGBoost is a decision tree-based ensemble learning algorithm that 
uses a gradient boosting framework. It uses an artificial neural network and 
predicts the unstructured data in a structured manner. This CNN-based supervised 
learning model is tested and simulated on a real-time elderly heart patient IoT 
dataset. The proposed methodology has a recall value of 100%, an F1-Score of 
94.8%, a precision of 98%, and an accuracy of 98%, which is higher than existing 
approaches like decision trees, random forests, and Support Vector Machine. The 
results reveal that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art 
methodologies and improves elderly heart disease patient monitoring with a low 
error rate.

Detrimental effects of physical inactivity on peripheral and brain vasculature 
in humans: Insights into mechanisms, long-term health consequences and 
protective strategies.

The growing prevalence of physical inactivity in the population highlights the 
urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of how sedentary behaviour 
affects health, the mechanisms involved and what strategies are effective in 
counteracting its negative effects. Physical inactivity is an independent risk 
factor for different pathologies including atherosclerosis, hypertension and 
cardiovascular disease. It is known to progressively lead to reduced life 
expectancy and quality of life, and it is the fourth leading risk factor for 
mortality worldwide. Recent evidence indicates that uninterrupted prolonged 
sitting and short-term inactivity periods impair endothelial function (measured 
by flow-mediated dilation) and induce arterial structural alterations, 
predominantly in the lower body vasculature. Similar effects may occur in the 
cerebral vasculature, with recent evidence showing impairments in cerebral blood 
flow following prolonged sitting. The precise molecular and physiological 
mechanisms underlying inactivity-induced vascular dysfunction in humans are yet 
to be fully established, although evidence to date indicates that it may involve 
modulation of shear stress, inflammatory and vascular biomarkers. Despite the 
steady increase in sedentarism in our societies, only a few intervention 
strategies have been investigated for their efficacy in counteracting the 
associated vascular impairments. The current review provides a comprehensive 
overview of the evidence linking acute and short-term physical inactivity to 
detrimental effects on peripheral, central and cerebral vascular health in 
humans. We further examine the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms 
and attempt to link these to long-term consequences for cardiovascular health. 
Finally, we summarize and discuss the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in 
offsetting the negative consequences of physical inactivity.

The RASopathies are a group of genetic conditions resulting from mutations 
within the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS-MAPK) pathway. Lymphatic 
abnormalities are commonly associated with these conditions, however central 
conducting lymphatic abnormalities (CCLA) have only recently been described. 
CCLAs may be progressive and can result in devastating systemic sequelae, such 
as recurrent chylothoraces, chylopericardium and chylous ascites which can cause 
significant morbidity and even mortality. Improvements in imaging modalities of 
the central lymphatics have enhanced our understanding of these complex 
abnormalities. Management is challenging and have mainly consisted of diuretics 
and invasive mechanical drainages. We describe two adult males with Noonan 
syndrome with a severe and progressive CCLA. In one patient we report the 
therapeutic role of targeted molecular therapy with the MEK inhibitor 
'Trametinib', which has resulted in dramatic, and sustained, clinical 
improvement. The successful use of MEK inhibition highlights the importance of 
understanding the molecular cause of lymphatic abnormalities and utilising 
targeted therapies to improve quality of life and potentially life expectancy.

Computer Coded Verbal Autopsy (CCVA) algorithms are commonly used to determine 
the cause of death (CoD) from questionnaire responses extracted from verbal 
autopsies (VAs). However, they can only operate on structured data and cannot 
effectively harness information from unstructured VA narratives. Machine 
Learning (ML) algorithms have also been applied successfully in determining the 
CoD from VA narratives, allowing the use of auxiliary information that CCVA 
algorithms cannot directly utilize. However, most ML-based studies only use 
responses from the structured questionnaire, and the results lack 
generalisability and comparability across studies. We present a comparative 
performance evaluation of ML methods and CCVA algorithms on South African VA 
narratives data, using data from Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance 
Site (HDSS) with physicians' classifications as the gold standard. The data were 
collected from 1993 to 2015 and have 16,338 cases. The random forest and extreme 
gradient boosting classifiers outperformed the other classifiers on the combined 
dataset, attaining accuracy of 96% respectively, with significant statistical 
differences in algorithmic performance (p < 0.0001). All our models attained 
Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of greater than 0.884. The 
InterVA CCVA attained 83% Cause Specific Mortality Fraction accuracy and an 
Overall Chance-Corrected Concordance of 0.36. We demonstrate that ML models 
could accurately determine the cause of death from VA narratives. Additionally, 
through mortality trends and pattern analysis, we discovered that in the first 
decade of the civil registration system in South Africa, the average life 
expectancy was approximately 50 years. However, in the second decade, life 
expectancy significantly dropped, and the population was dying at a much younger 
average age of 40 years, mostly from the leading HIV related causes. 
Interestingly, in the third decade, we see a gradual improvement in life 
expectancy, possibly attributed to effective health intervention programmes. 
Through a structure and semantic analysis of narratives where experts disagree, 
we also demonstrate the most frequent terms of traditional healer consultations 
and visits. The comparative approach also makes this study a baseline that can 
be used for future research enforcing generalization and comparability. Future 
study will entail exploring deep learning models for CoD classification.

Background : In order to make informed COVID-19 related decisions, individuals 
need information about their personal risks and how those risks may vary with 
specific demographic and health characteristics. The Fight COVID MKE web=based 
risk assessment tool allows for assessment of COVID-19 mortality risk as a 
function of personal and neighborhood characteristics. The purpose of this study 
is to explore public understanding of this risk assessment tool and risk 
perception through community focus groups. Methods : Individuals were recruited 
from Milwaukee County to participate in nine online focus groups where the risk 
assessment tool was presented for feedback. Focus group transcripts were then 
analyzed qualitatively for common themes using MAXQDA. Results : Three main 
themes were identified in the focus groups regarding the web-based risk 
assessment tool: access, understanding, and usefulness. Conclusions : This paper 
explores how members of the community interpret individual risk assessments and 
life expectancy estimations, and how these vary with age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing comorbidities. 
Understanding COVID-19 infection and progression rates, and how they vary with a 
full set of patient-specific characteristics is critical for effective policy 
and practice responses to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as for future infection 
outbreaks.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluate cost-effectiveness of primary treatments for localised 
prostate cancer by uniquely combining prospectively collected real-world 
outcomes and costs from UCSF Cancer of Prostate Strategic Urologic Research 
Endeavor (CaPSURE‚Ñ¢).
METHODS: Markov models assessed cost-effectiveness of radical prostatectomy 
(RP), brachytherapy, electron beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy 
with EBRT by risk from US payers perspective over 8‚Äâyears. Treatment costs 
included office visits, hospitalisation, procedures, medication and long-term 
care. Patients' surveyed HRQoL were mapped into utilities. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) used cost per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and willingness-to-pay of $150,000/QALY.
RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) showed for low-risk prostate cancer, 
EBRT dominated the lowest cost brachytherapy, but RPns and brachytherapy plus 
EBRT were cost-effective compared to brachytherapy with ICERs of $18,926 and 
$41,662 per QALY. In medium-risk patients, RP, EBRT and brachytherapy plus EBRT 
all were cost-effective compared with brachytherapy, with ICERs of $30,604, 
$22,588 and $21,627/QALY. In high-risk, brachytherapy dominated all treatments. 
Procedure cost and utility are driving ICER, but probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed the model was robust across variables.
CONCLUSION: This first CEA combining prospective real-world evidence for HRQOL 
outcomes with costs shows cost-effectiveness of treatments vary by risk groups, 
providing new evidence for treatment decisions.

Flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP) is a well-known phenomenon in spinal 
extensor muscles. According to the literature, prolonged flexed posture leads to 
creep phenomenon and affects the active and passive neuromuscular control of the 
spinal column. The purpose of this study was to investigate FRP occurrence in 
elite cyclists that prolonged flexion posture is an integral part of their 
professional life. Their muscles' contraction pattern during forward bending was 
also compared. Electromyography (EMG) was recorded during flexion and extension 
from standing position in thoracic erector spinae (TES), lumbar erector spinae 
(LES) and gluteus maximus (Gluteus max) in 15 healthy male elite cyclists. In 
addition, the kinematic data related to the trunk angles were simultaneously 
recorded by a motion analysis system. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess the 
effects of muscle group and direction of movement on maximum amplitude of EMG 
activity. Among 15 cyclists, FRP was detectable in 60%, 87% and 73% of the 
participants in TES, LES and Gluteus max, respectively, and happened between 74% 
and 82% of the trunk flexion. There was no statistically significant difference 
in onset and offset of muscles FRP. Despite prolong hyper kyphotic posture, FRP 
was identifiable in TES, LES and Gluteus max muscles of elite cyclists.

AIM: The health benefits of "going out-of-home" frequently among older adults 
are well known. A hilly environment would inhibit this habit. This study 
examined (i) longitudinal associations between a hilly environment and the 
frequency of going out-of-home, and (ii) the moderating effect of driving status 
on their association among older adults.
METHODS: This study involved a longitudinal study design. Data on 856 older 
adults in Nada Ward, Kobe, Japan, was obtained from a three-wave questionnaire 
survey (Wave 1: December 2017 to January 2018; Wave 2: after 1 year; Wave 3: 
after 3‚Äâyears). In each survey, the frequency of going out-of-home time was 
measured. The average land slope within 500‚Äâm network buffers of each 
participant's home was calculated as the index of the hilly environment. Driving 
status was also measured.
RESULTS: The latent growth model revealed that while a higher value of average 
land slope was not significantly associated with changes in the frequency of 
going out-of-home over time, it was significantly associated with a lower 
frequency of going out-of-home at the initial level. The interaction term in the 
latent growth model showed that driving status did not moderate the associations 
of the average land slope with the initial level of, and changes in, the 
frequency of going out-of-home.
CONCLUSIONS: Although it remains unclear whether a hilly environment would 
accelerate a decline in the frequency of going out-of-home over time, this study 
found that older adults living in a hilly environment were less likely to leave 
their homes. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 961-967.

As living standards rise, the demand for high-quality chilled meat among 
consumers also grows. Researchers and enterprises have been interested in 
ensuring the quality of chilled meat in all links of the downstream industry. 
Nanozyme has shown the potential to address the aforementioned requirements. 
Reasons and approaches for the application of nanozymes in the freshness 
assessment or shelf life extension of chilled meat were discussed. The 
challenges for applying these nanozymes to ensure the quality of chilled meat 
were also summarized. Finally, this review examined the safety, regulatory 
status, and consumer attitudes toward nanozymes. This review revealed that the 
freshness assessment of chilled meat is closely related to mimicking the enzyme 
activities of nanozymes, whereas the shelf life changes of chilled meat are 
mostly dependent on the photothermal activities and pseudophotodynamic 
activities of nanozymes. In contrast, studies regarding the shelf life of 
chilled meat are more challenging to develop, as excessive heat or reactive 
oxygen species impair its quality. Notably, meat contains a complex matrix 
composition that may interact with the nanozyme, reducing its effectiveness. 
Nanopollution and mass manufacturing are additional obstacles that must be 
overcome. Therefore, it is vital to choose suitable approaches to ensure meat 
quality. Furthermore, the safety of nanozymes in meat applications still needs 
careful consideration owing to their widespread usage.

"Frailty" is a term used to refer to a state characterized by enhanced 
vulnerability to, and impaired recovery from, stressors compared with a nonfrail 
state, which is increasingly viewed as a loss of resilience. With increasing 
life expectancy and the associated rise in years spent with physical frailty, 
there is a need to understand the clinical and physiological features of frailty 
and the factors driving it. We describe the clinical definitions of age-related 
frailty and their limitations in allowing us to understand the pathogenesis of 
this prevalent condition. Given that age-related frailty manifests in the form 
of functional declines such as poor balance, falls, and immobility, as an 
alternative we view frailty from a physiological viewpoint and describe what is 
known of the organ-based components of frailty, including adiposity, the brain, 
and neuromuscular, skeletal muscle, immune, and cardiovascular systems, as 
individual systems and as components in multisystem dysregulation. By doing so 
we aim to highlight current understanding of the physiological phenotype of 
frailty and reveal key knowledge gaps and potential mechanistic drivers of the 
trajectory to frailty. We also review the studies in humans that have intervened 
with exercise to reduce frailty. We conclude that more longitudinal and 
interventional clinical studies are required in older adults. Such observational 
studies should interrogate the progression from a nonfrail to a frail state, 
assessing individual elements of frailty to produce a deep physiological 
phenotype of the syndrome. The findings will identify mechanistic drivers of 
frailty and allow targeted interventions to diminish frailty progression.

Diabetes mellitus, defined as long-standing hyperglycemic conditions caused by a 
defect in insulin production and activity, has become a major healthcare burden 
as the number of catastrophic and life-threatening complications rises. 
Microvascular complications (neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy), and also 
diabetes-related macrovascular complications are common problems that arise as 
the life expectancy of diabetic patients has increased despite improved 
treatment options. While it is impossible to pinpoint the specific crucial 
timing when the complications become fully entrenched, looking for novel 
sensitive biomarkers to identify physiological changes in the initial stages 
would be needed. An increasing amount of data shows that miRNAs, particularly 
miRNA146a, are stable in a range of body fluids and can be used to identify 
pathogenic changes at the cellular or tissue level. In this brief review, we 
highlight the important functioning of miRNA146a and its putative target of 
action in diabetic microvascular and cardiovascular complications. A decrease in 
miRNA146a levels may play a critical role in the onset and development of 
diabetes complications, whereas its anti-inflammatory properties were revealed 
to be associated with the pathogenesis of numerous diabetic complications, 
including diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and diabetes-related 
cardiovascular disorders, even tending to be a potential biomarker of the 
disease's inflammatory status.

Determining the amount of medication used is essential for correctly managing 
treatment systems. The unauthorized use of drugs and the importance of 
determining the absorbed and required dose of drugs in target organs are 
essential factors that justify the design of new drug monitoring systems. 
Electrochemical sensors and biosensors based on nanomaterials have been 
developed for drug monitoring in the past few years. The use of nanomaterials to 
optimize the analyte detection process and facilitate electron transfer in 
electrochemical processes has enhanced intermolecular interactions and increased 
diagnostic sensitivity. Considering this review, in the first part, the 
evaluation of cancer drugs is examined, which can be used to determine the exact 
dose of the drug required in different stages of cancer. Accurate monitoring of 
cancer drugs can increase patient life expectancy, reduce side effects, and 
increase economic savings. In the next section, sensors and biosensors designed 
for antibiotics are examined. Accurate measurement of antibiotics for 
determining the effectiveness of the dose in controlling infections and 
preventing antibiotic resistance is possible with the help of these drug 
diagnostic platforms. In the next part, the diagnosis of different hormones is 
considered. Abnormal amounts (low/high) of hormones cause multiple physiological 
complications and various disabilities. Therefore, accurate determination of 
hormone levels can effectively treat hormonal changes. In the last section, 
other drugs, including drugs and analgesics for which the use of electrochemical 
diagnostic platforms can significantly help drug distribution and social health 
systems, are also discussed.
