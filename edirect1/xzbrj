Chronic pancreatitis is a disease of the pancreas in which recurrent 
inflammatory episodes result in replacement of pancreatic parenchyma by fibrous 
connective tissue. This fibrotic reorganization of the pancreas leads to a 
progressive exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In addition, 
characteristic complications arise, such as pseudocysts, pancreatic duct 
obstructions, duodenal obstruction, vascular complications, obstruction of the 
bile ducts, malnutrition and pain syndrome. Pain presents as the main symptom of 
patients with chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for 
pancreatic carcinoma. Chronic pancreatitis significantly reduces the quality of 
life and the life expectancy of affected patients. These guidelines were 
researched and compiled by 74 representatives from 11 learned societies and 
their intention is to serve evidence-based professional training as well as 
continuing education. On this basis they shall improve the medical care of 
affected patients in both the inpatient and outpatient sector. Chronic 
pancreatitis requires an adequate diagnostic workup and systematic management, 
given its severity, frequency, chronicity, and negative impact on the quality of 
life and life expectancy.

The development of new or direct oral anticoagulants was triggered by the 
disadvantages of classic oral anticoagulation, which was isolated in Link's 
laboratory in 1940. Some of these limitations are the individual variation in 
response to these drugs, drug interaction and the need for regular laboratory 
monitoring. With increasing comorbidity and life expectancy in populations these 
limitations led to interruption of treatment or even underuse of treatment in 
light of potential side effects. With the introduction of novel oral 
anticoagulants some of these drawbacks are targeted whereas even these drugs 
also have some limitations and should be given with cautions and not to all 
patients having an indication for anticoagulation.

BACKGROUND: The recently launched nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir 
represents a significant turn in the treatment paradigm of chronic hepatitis C. 
While effective, sofosbuvir is also associated with a considerable cost.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
sofosbuvir-containing regimens in treatment-naive patients with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 5 (HCV-G5) mono-infection in South Africa (SA).
DESIGN: We constructed a lifetime horizon decision-analytic Markov model of the 
natural history of HCV infection to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
sofosbuvir-ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) monotherapy against sofosbuvir triple therapy 
(SOF-TT) (sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon and ribavirin [peg-INF/RBV]) and the 
current standard of care (SOC) (peg-INF/RBV) for patients with chronic HCV-G5 in 
the South African context. The model was populated with data from published 
literature, expert opinion and South African private sector cost data. The price 
modelled for sofosbuvir was the predicted South African private sector price of 
82,129.32 South African rand (R) (US$7000) for 12 weeks. The analysis was 
conducted from a third-party payer perspective.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were discounted and undiscounted costs 
(in 2015 South African rand and US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Outcomes from the cost-effectiveness model show that SOF/LDV yields the 
most favourable future health economic outcomes compared with SOF-TT and the 
current SOC in SA. Findings relating to the lifetime incremental cost per QALY 
gained for patients infected with HCV-G5 indicate that SOF/LDV dominated both 
SOF-TT and SOC, i.e. SOF/LDV is less costly and more effective.
CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this analysis suggest that at a price of R123,190 
($US10,500) for 12 weeks of SOF/LDV might be cost effective for South African 
patients infected with HCV-G5.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether being elected to head of government is 
associated with accelerated mortality by studying survival differences between 
people elected to office and unelected runner-up candidates who never served.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Historical survival data on elected and runner-up candidates in 
parliamentary or presidential elections in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, 
Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States, from 1722 to 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: Elected and runner-up political candidates.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Observed number of years alive after each candidate's last 
election, relative to what would be expected for an average person of the same 
age and sex as the candidate during the year of the election, based on 
historical French and British life tables. Observed post-election life years 
were compared between elected candidates and runners-up, adjusting for life 
expectancy at time of election. A Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted for 
candidate's life expectancy at the time of election) considered years until 
death (or years until end of study period for those not yet deceased by 9 
September 2015) for elected candidates versus runners-up.
RESULTS: The sample included 540 candidates: 279 winners and 261 runners-up who 
never served. A total of 380 candidates were deceased by 9 September 2015. 
Candidates who served as a head of government lived 4.4 (95% confidence interval 
2.1 to 6.6) fewer years after their last election than did candidates who never 
served (17.8 v 13.4 years after last election; adjusted difference 2.7 (0.6 to 
4.8) years). In Cox proportional hazards analysis, which considered all 
candidates (alive or deceased), the mortality hazard for elected candidates 
relative to runners-up was 1.23 (1.00 to 1.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Election to head of government is associated with a substantial 
increase in mortality risk compared with candidates in national elections who 
never served.

Approximately 70.000 people are infected with hepatitis C virus in Hungary, more 
than half of whom are not aware of their infection. From the point of infected 
individuals early recognition and effective treatment of related liver injury 
may prevent consequent advanced liver diseases and complications (liver 
cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer) and can increase work productivity 
and life expectancy on one hand. From socioeconomic aspect, this could also 
prevent further spread of the virus as well as reduce substantially long term 
financial burden of related morbidity. Available since 2003 in Hungary, 
pegylated interferon + ribavirin dual therapy can clear the virus in 40-45% of 
previously not treated (naïve), and in 5-21% of previous treatment-failure 
patients. Addition of a direct acting first generation protease inhibitor drug 
(boceprevir or telaprevir) to the dual therapy increases the chance of sustained 
virologic response to 63-75% and 59-66%, respectively. These two protease 
inhibitors are available and financed for a segment of Hungarian patients since 
May 2013. Between 2013 and February 2015, other direct acting antiviral 
interferon-free combination therapies have been registered for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C, with a potential efficacy over 90% and typical short 
duration of 8-12 weeks. Indication of therapy includes exclusion of 
contraindications to the drugs and demonstration of viral replication with 
consequent liver injury, i.e., inflammation and or fibrosis in the liver. 
Non-invasive methods (eleastography and biochemical methods) are accepted and 
preferred for staging liver damage (fibrosis). For initiation of treatment 
accurate and timely molecular biology tests are mandatory. Eligibility for 
treatment is a subject of individual central medical review. Due to budget 
limitations tharpy is covered only for a proportion of patients by the National 
Health Insurance Fund. Priority is given to those with urgent need based on a 
Hungarian Priority Index system reflecting primarily the stage of liver disease, 
and considering also additional factors, i.e., activity and progression of liver 
disease, predictive factors of treatment and other special issues. Approved 
treatments are restricted to the most cost-effective combinations based on the 
cost per sustained virologic response value in different patient categories with 
consensus between professional organizations, National Health Insurance Fund and 
patient organizations. More expensive therapies might be available upon 
co-financing by the patient or a third party. Interferon-free treatments and 
shorter therapy durations preferred as much as financially feasible. A separate 
budget is allocated to cover interferon-free treatments for the most-in-need 
interferon ineligible/intolerant patients, and for those who have no more 
interferon-based therapy option. Orv. Hetil., 2015, 156(Suppl. 2), 3-24.

Diagnosis and treatment of HBV/HDV infection means for the patient to be able to 
maintain working capacity, to increase quality of life, to prevent cancer, and 
to prolong life expectancy, while society benefits from eliminating the chances 
of further transmission of the viruses, and decreasing the overall costs of 
serious complications. The guideline delineates the treatment algorithms for 
2016 set by a consensus meeting of physicians involved in the treatment of these 
diseases. The prevalence of HBV infection in the Hungarian general population is 
0.5-0.7%. The indications of treatment is based upon viral examinations 
(including viral nucleic acid determination), determinations of disease activity 
and stage (including biochemical, pathologic, and/or non-invasive methods), and 
excluding contraindications. To avoid unnecessary side effects and for 
cost-effective approach the guideline stresses the importance of quick and 
detailed virologic evaluations, the applicability of elastography as an 
acceptable alternative of liver biopsy in this regard, as well as the relevance 
of appropriate consistent follow up schedule for viral response during therapy. 
The first choice of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection can be pegylated 
interferon for 48 weeks or continuous ente- cavir or tenofovir therapy. The 
latter two must be continued for at least 12 months after hepatitis B surface 
antigen seroconversion. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended mainly in combination 
therapy. Lamivudine is no longer a first choice; patients currently taking 
lamivudine must switch if response is inadequate. Appropriate treatment of 
patients taking immunosuppressive medications is highly recommended. Pegylated 
interferon based therapy is recommended for the treatment of concomitant 
hepatitis D infection. Orv. Hetil., 2015, 156(Suppl. 2) 25-36.

BACKGROUND: Few reports have thus far discussed the influence of economic 
factors on treatment decision-making by patients. The objective of the present 
study was to clarify the awareness among oncologists of health economics in 
cancer treatment.
METHODS: The present study was based on the questionnaire regarding health 
economics in cancer treatment carried out by the Japan Society of Clinical 
Oncology (JSCO) in July 2013. The subjects were trustees registered with JSCO. 
The survey investigated the influence of medical expenses on patient access to 
and selection of medical treatment in order to clarify the primary attributes of 
the respondents and their awareness of economics. The study also investigated 
the maximum allowable public medical expenses to prolong the life expectancy of 
a cancer patient by 1 year and the factors that can influence treatment 
selection.
RESULTS: The 172 respondents had completed a mean of 30.3 ± 6.2 postgraduate 
years, and the mean number of patients they treated annually was 1323 ± 1963. 
The degree of treatment accessibility among patients was perceived positively by 
112 (71.3 %) and negatively by 49 (28.7 %) of the respondents, irrespective of 
medical expenses. Of the 172 respondents, 66 (41.0 %) believed that the maximum 
allowable medical expenses for cancer treatment should be ≤4 million yen/LY, 
with 62 (39.8 %) reporting a value of 4.01-8 million yen/LY.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that a certain range of medical 
expenses has come to be regarded as the standard range of medical expenses for 
cancer treatment among oncologists, with answers based on the premise that 
patients should have access to effective medical treatment.

OBJECTIVE: to show reviewed information of published studies relating to 
Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), nutrition, and genes involved in the 
development of this pathology.
RESULTS: an analysis showing familial hypercholesterolemia as a disorder 
occuring due to mutations in gene encoding of the LDL receptor, which can be 
transmitted as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. It's diagnosis is 
important for those with a greater likelihood of premature coronary disease, and 
can significantly reduce life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: there are no specific clinical criteria with absolute predictive 
value for the diagnosis of HF, Genetic diagnosis can prove functional defects in 
the LDL receptor gene, constituting definitive confirmation of the diagnosis, 
thus the importance of presenting a genetic vision of development of this 
disease, which can be treated adequately through diet therapy affecting future 
generations in the family concerned.

Publisher: Objetivo: mostrar información revisada de manera sistemática de 
estudios publicados relacionados con la hipercolesterolemia familiar (HF), la 
nutrición y los genes que intervienen en el desarrollo de esta patología. 
Resultados: el análisis de los resultados de investigación consultados pone de 
manifiesto que la hipercolesterolemia familiar es un trastorno que se produce 
debido a mutaciones en genes que codifican el receptor de LDL, que se puede 
transmitir de forma autosómica dominante o bien autosómica recesiva. La 
importancia de su diagnóstico radica en que las personas afectas presentan una 
elevada frecuencia de enfermedad coronaria prematura, reduciéndose de forma 
importante su expectativa de vida. Conclusiones: no existen criterios clínicos 
específicos con un valor predictivo absoluto para el diagnóstico de HF; el 
diagnóstico genético permite demostrar defectos funcionales en el gen del 
receptor LDL, constituyendo la confirmación definitiva del diagnóstico, de ahí 
la importancia de presentar una visión genética del desarrollo de esta 
patología, que puede ser tratada para generaciones futuras de manera adecuada a 
través de la dietoterapia en la familia afectada.

INTRODUCTION: metabolic syndrome is a group of metabolic abnormalities that 
increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
There are several criteria for diagnosis; the most used are the International 
Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). An early 
treatment may prevent its associated complications and improve the quality and 
life expectancy of the person; it must be focused on changes in lifestyle such 
as healthy eating and regular physical activity.
OBJECTIVE: to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to the 
diagnostic criteria of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the Adult 
Treatment Panel III (ATP III) Methodology: it was a cross-sectional study in 
which participate 128 people (55 women and 73 men) aged between 18 and 75 years, 
who were given a nutritional history, anthropometric measures and biochemical 
tests.
RESULTS: the prevalence of overweight was 63% (48% overweight and 15% obese). 
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to IDF was 15.6% and 14.8% 
according ATPIII.
CONCLUSIONS: among the employees is clear the high prevalence of overweight and 
metabolic syndrome. So it is a priority to work on the implementation of 
preventive measures to stop this trend and cardiometabolic disorders.

en el estilo de vida, como una alimentación saludable y actividad física 
regular. Objetivo: determinar la prevalencia de síndrome metabólico según los 
criterios de diagnóstico de la Federación Internacional de Diabetes (IDF) y del 
Panel de Tratamiento de Adultos III (ATP III). Metodología: es un estudio de 
corte transversal en el cual participaron 128 personas (55 mujeres y 73 hombres) 
de entre 18 y 75 años de edad, a quienes se les realizó una historia 
nutricional, medidas antropométricas y exámenes bioquímicos. Resultados: la 
prevalencia de exceso de peso fue del 63% (sobrepeso 48% y obesidad 15%). La 
prevalencia de síndrome metabólico según IDF fue 15,6% y según ATPIII 14,8%. 
Conclusiones: en el personal evaluado, es evidente la alta prevalencia de exceso 
de peso y síndrome metabólico, por lo que es prioritario trabajar en la 
implementación de medidas preventivas para detener su progresión y el desarrollo 
de complicaciones cardiometabólicas.

INTRODUCTION: Small bowel capsule endoscopy is currently the first line 
diagnostic examination for many diseases affecting the small bowel. This article 
aims to review and critically address the current indications of small bowel 
capsule endoscopy in clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bibliographic review of relevant and recent papers indexed 
in PubMed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Small bowel capsule endoscopy enables a non-invasive 
full-assessment of the small bowel mucosa, with high diagnostic yield even for 
subtle lesions. In patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, diagnostic 
yield is higher when performed early after the onset of bleeding. Endoscopic 
treatment of angioectasias using balloon-assisted enteroscopy may contribute to 
reduce rebleeding, while the risk of rebleeding in patients with 'negative' 
small bowel capsule endoscopy is debatable. Cross-sectional imaging may be more 
accurate than small bowel capsule endoscopy for the diagnosis of large small 
bowel tumors. The Smooth Protruding Index on Capsule Endoscopy (SPICE score) may 
help to differentiate submucosal tumors from innocent bulges. Small bowel 
capsule endoscopy is also a key diagnostic instrument in patients with suspected 
Crohn's disease and non-diagnostic ileocolonoscopy; it may also influence 
prognosis and therapeutic management, by determining disease extent and activity 
in patients with known Crohn's disease. The role of small bowel capsule 
endoscopy to investigate possible complications in patients with non-responsive 
coeliac disease is evolving.
CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel capsule endoscopy is a valuable diagnostic instrument 
for patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and/or suspected small bowel 
tumors; it may also be a key examination in patients with suspected Crohn's 
disease, or patients with known Crohn's disease to fully assess disease 
extension and activity; finally, it may contribute for the diagnosis of 
complications of non-responsive coeliac disease.

Publisher: Introdução: A enteroscopia por cápsula é o exame de primeira linha no 
diagnóstico de diversas patologias do intestino delgado. Este artigo tem por 
objectivo rever e analisar criticamente as indicações actuais para enteroscopia 
por cápsula na prática clínica. Material e Métodos: Revisão bibliográfica 
suportada em artigos indexados na PubMed. Resultados e Discussão: A enteroscopia 
por cápsula permite a avaliação não invasiva da mucosa do intestino delgado, com 
elevado rendimento diagnóstico. Em doentes com hemorragia digestiva de causa 
obscura, o rendimento da enteroscopia por cápsula aumenta quando realizada 
precocemente após o evento hemorrágico. O tratamento das angiectasias com 
enteroscopia assistida por balão permite diminuir a recidiva hemorrágica, 
enquanto o risco de recidiva em doentes com enteroscopia por cápsula 'negativa' 
é controverso. A entero-TC/entero-RM podem superiorizar-se à enteroscopia por 
cápsula no diagnóstico de alguns tumores. O 'Smooth Protruding Index on Capsule 
Endoscopy' (score SPICE) auxilia na diferenciação entre verdadeiros tumores 
submucosos e abaulamentos não patológicos. A enteroscopia por cápsula é valiosa 
em doentes com suspeita de doença de Crohn quando a ileocolonoscopia não é 
diagnóstica, permitindo também estadiar a extensão e actividade das lesões em 
doentes com diagnóstico prévio de doença de Crohn, com potenciais implicações 
prognósticas e terapêuticas. A enteroscopia por cápsula permite ainda o 
diagnóstico de complicações em doentes com doença celíaca refractária. 
Conclusões: Actualmente, a importãncia da enteroscopia por cápsula é reconhecida 
no contexto da hemorragia digestiva de causa obscura e/ou suspeita de tumores do 
intestino delgado, bem como na suspeita de doença de Crohn ou em doentes com 
doença de Crohn conhecida para determinar a localização, extensão e actividade 
da doença, e ainda para a investigação de doentes com doença celíaca 
refractária.

Power.

We tested a hypothesis that low-load squat training with slow movement and tonic 
force generation (LST) would increase muscle size and strength but not 
necessarily power. Healthy young men were assigned to LST [50% one-repetition 
maximum (1-RM) load, 3 s for lowering/lifting without pause: n=9] or low-load 
normal speed (LN: 50% 1-RM load, 1 s for lowering/lifting with 1-s pause; n=7) 
groups. Both groups underwent an 8-week squat training program (10 
repetitions/set, 3 sets/day, and 3 days/week) using the assigned methods. Before 
and after the intervention, quadriceps femoris muscle thickness, maximal torque 
during isometric hip extension and knee extension, 1-RM squat, lifting power 
from squatting position and rate of electromyography rise (RER) in knee 
extensors during the task, leg extension power and vertical jump height were 
measured. After the intervention, the LN group showed no changes in all the 
variables. The LST group significantly (P<0.05) increased muscle thickness 
(6-10%), isometric hip extension torque (18%) and 1-RM squat (10%), but not 
isometric knee extension torque, lifting power and RER, leg extension power and 
vertical jump height. These results suggest that LST can increase muscle size 
and task-related strength, but has little effect on power production during 
dynamic explosive movements.

The positive benefit-risk ratio of most drugs is decreasing in correlation to 
very old age, the extent of comorbidity, dementia, frailty and limited life 
expectancy (VOCODFLEX). First, we review the extent of inappropriate medication 
use and polypharmacy (IMUP) globally and highlight its negative medical, 
nursing, social and economic consequences. Second, we expose the main 
clinical/practical and perceptual obstacles that combine to create the negative 
vicious circle that eventually makes us feel frustrated and hopeless in treating 
VOCODFLEX in general, and in our 'war against IMUP' in particular. Third, we 
summarize the main international approaches/methods suggested and tried in 
different countries in an attempt to improve the ominous clinical and economic 
outcomes of IMUP; these include a variety of clinical, pharmacological, 
computer-assisted and educational programs. Lastly, we suggest a new 
comprehensive perception for providing good medical practice to VOCODFLEX in the 
21st century. This includes new principles for research, education and clinical 
practice guidelines completely different from the 'single disease model' 
research and clinical rules we were raised upon and somehow 'fanatically' 
adopted in the 20th century. This new perception, based on palliative, geriatric 
and ethical principle, may provide fresh tools for treating VOCODFLEX in general 
and reducing IMUP in particular.

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder involving excess genetic material from 
chromosome 21. The incidence of DS is increasing, and the life expectancy for 
individuals with DS has increased to a median age of 55 years. Adults with DS 
are at increased risk of several conditions, including significant neurologic, 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, endocrine, 
psychiatric, hematologic, and social comorbidities, and additional screening or 
monitoring may be needed. Additional preventive measures for patients with DS 
include regular screening for thyroid dysfunction, hearing loss, eye disorders, 
heart disease, osteoporosis, and dementia, and one-time vaccination with the 
polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). Quality of life should 
be the main focus of treatment, with patients being involved in medical 
decisions as much as possible.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that primarily affect motor 
function. This developmental disability is becoming more common in adults as 
life expectancy increases for individuals with CP. Many physical, medical, 
mental, and behavioral health conditions are associated with CP, and assistance 
should be provided to patients with CP to optimize function, when available. 
These comorbidities include intellectual disabilities, seizures, muscle 
contractures, abnormal gait, osteoporosis, communication disorders, 
malnutrition, sleep disorders, and mental health disorders, such as depression 
and anxiety. The physician should be familiar with screening for and assisting 
patients with these issues. Optimizing quality of life requires individualized 
care plans that may include physical therapy, muscle relaxants, surgery, and 
nutritional support. Other issues to be addressed include methods to facilitate 
employment; sexual concerns; and support through local and national 
organizations for patients, families, and caregivers.

Effects of hamstring stretching on passive muscle stiffness vary between hip 
flexion and knee extension maneuvers.

Sports in Kanoya, Kagoshima, Japan.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the effects of hamstring 
stretching on the passive stiffness of each of the long head of the biceps 
femoris (BFl), semitendinosus (ST), and semimembranosus (SM) vary between 
passive knee extension and hip flexion stretching maneuvers. In 12 male 
subjects, before and after five sets of 90 s static stretching, passive 
lengthening measurements where knee or hip joint was passively rotated to the 
maximal range of motion (ROM) were performed. During the passive lengthening, 
shear modulus of each muscle was measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. 
Both stretching maneuvers significantly increased maximal ROM and decreased 
passive torque at a given joint angle. Passive knee extension stretching 
maneuver significantly reduced shear modulus at a given knee joint angle in all 
of BFl, ST, and SM. In contrast, the stretching effect by passive hip flexion 
maneuver was significant only in ST and SM. The present findings indicate that 
the effects of hamstring stretching on individual passive muscles' stiffness 
vary between passive knee extension and hip flexion stretching maneuvers. In 
terms of reducing the muscle stiffness of BFl, stretching of the hamstring 
should be performed by passive knee extension rather than hip flexion.

BACKGROUND: This study attempts to quantify the burden of disease averted 
through the global surgical work of a large cleft charity, and estimate the 
economic impact of this effort over a 10-year period.
METHODS: Anonymized data of all primary cleft lip and cleft palate procedures in 
the Smile Train database were analyzed and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) calculated using country-specific life expectancy tables, established 
disability weights, and estimated success of surgery and residual disability 
probabilities; multiple age weighting and discounting permutations were 
included. Averted DALYs were calculated and gross national income (GNI) per 
capita was then multiplied by averted DALYs to estimate economic gains.
RESULTS: 548,147 primary cleft procedures were performed in 83 countries between 
2001 and 2011. 547,769 records contained complete data available for the study; 
58 % were cleft lip and 42 % cleft palate. Averted DALYs ranged between 1.46 and 
4.95 M. The mean economic impact ranged between USD 5510 and 50,634 per person. 
This corresponded to a global economic impact of between USD 3.0B and 27.7B USD, 
depending on the DALY and GNI values used. The estimated cost of providing these 
procedures based on an average reimbursement rate was USD 197M (0.7-6.6 % of the 
estimated impact).
CONCLUSIONS: The immense economic gain realized through procedures focused on a 
small proportion of the surgical burden of disease highlights the importance and 
cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment globally. This methodology can be 
applied to evaluate interventions for other conditions, and for evidence-based 
health care resource allocation.

[Air Entrapment Caused by Valve Mechanisms in Chronic Wounds, a Benign 
Phenomenon? A Series of Three Cases].

[Article in German]

BACKGROUND: Benign subcutaneous emphysema caused by a valve mechanism and 
subsequent air entrapment is rare. Less invasive treatment can be performed, but 
acute life-threatening infectious diseases should be ruled out before treatment; 
these include gas gangrene or other infections caused by gas producing bacteria.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively report on three patients with chronic 
wounds who developed benign subcutaneous extremity emphysema caused by valve 
mechanisms with subsequent air entrapment. Patient 1 had a chronic wound at his 
stump after a lower leg amputation years ago. Due to weight loading and 
unloading of the lower leg prosthesis while walking, air was sucked in and 
triggered subcutaneous emphysema. Patient 2 had a persistent fistula at his 
lateral thigh due to a chronic osteomyelitis and Girdlestone hip. Caused by the 
up-and-down movements of the femur during walking air was entrapped and led to 
emphysema. Patient 3 had a drain in his knee for development of a chronic 
fistula because of a persistent infection of his knee prosthesis. In extension 
of the knee, the drain was clamped in and air was entrapped during knee flexion 
and then seeped into the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. No signs of infection 
in the blood samples were present in two of the patients. None of the patients 
had fever and no gas producing bacteria were identified in the microbiological 
cultures. Only multisensitive Staphylococcus aureus was present in the wounds of 
patients 1 and 2.
RESULTS: Two patients were treated surgically. One patient was treated by 
fasciotomy plus debridement and irrigation of the wound. A second patient was 
treated by debridement of the Girdlestone hip, air evacuation and insertion of a 
drain. No sign of infection - such as necrosis or gangreneous tissue - was seen 
during these operations. In patient 3, the drain was removed in flexion of the 
knee and air was removed from the subcutaneous tissue through a separate, 
sterile needle punction.
CONCLUSION: There have been few published reports on benign subcutaneous 
emphysema caused by a valve mechanism. No standardised treatments exist, as it 
is initially difficult to distinguish this condition from an acute 
life-threatening infection. If a patient has a chronic wound at the location of 
the endoprosthesis or stump prosthesis after amputation, the possibility of 
benign air entrapment should be routinely considered.

The reservoir competence and long life expectancy of edible dormice, Glis glis, 
suggest that they serve as efficient reservoir hosts for Lyme disease (LD) 
spirochetes. Their arboreality, however, may reduce the probability to encounter 
sufficient questing Ixodes ricinus ticks to acquire and perpetuate LD 
spirochetes. To define the potential role of this small arboreal hibernator in 
the transmission cycle of LD spirochetes, we examined their rate and density of 
infestation with subadult ticks throughout the season of activity. Of the 1081 
edible dormice that we captured at five study sites in Southern Germany and 
inspected for ticks at 2946 capture occasions, 26 % were infested with at least 
one and as many as 26 subadult ticks on their ear pinnae. The distribution of 
ticks feeding on edible dormice was highly aggregated. Although only few 
individuals harbored nymphal ticks soon after their emergence from hibernation, 
the rate of nymphal infestation increased steadily throughout the season and 
reached about 35 % in September. Dormice inhabiting a site with few conspecifics 
seemed more likely to be infested by numerous ticks, particularly nymphs, than 
those individuals living in densely populated sites. Male dormice were more 
likely to be parasitized by numerous nymphs than were females, independent of 
their age and body mass. Our observation that season, population density, and 
sex affect the rates of ticks feeding on edible dormice suggests that the 
contribution of edible dormice to the transmission cycle of LD spirochetes 
depends mainly on their ranging behavior and level of activity.

OBJECTIVES: Health Impact Assessments (HIA) approach can be executed by 
calculating the attributable burden of disease. The most common indicators used 
in the HIA methodology are: premature mortality, morbidity, life-expectancy, and 
Disability Adjusted Life-Year (DALY). The term Disability Adjusted Life-Years 
(DALYs) indicates months/years lost due to a premature death or disability. The 
aim of the study was to present health benefits, expressed in terms of lower 
total mortality and cardio-respiratory hospitalization rates, due to a decreased 
particulate matter (PM) concentration in ambient air, in Silesian voivodeship.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper, results obtained from the APHEKOM 
(Improving Knowledge and Communication for Decision Making on Air Pollution and 
Health in Europe) project, which provided specialized HIA tools, useful for 
assessing health benefits resulting from reducing air pollution, were used. Both 
short-term and long-term exposure HIA tools were applied with regard to the 
appropriate data for Silesian voivodeship. Exposure data were obtained from the 
Regional Environmental Inspectorate in Katowice, while population and health 
data were obtained from the Central Statistical Office of Poland or from the 
Silesian Voivodeship Office, respectively.
RESULTS: Health benefits that are related to an improvement of ambient air 
quality in Silesia region are similar to previous estimates obtained for Kraków 
city. The reduction of short-term exposure to PM10 by 5 μg/m3 results in a lower 
number of yearly non-external deaths (2.6-2.75 per 100 000 inhabitants). This 
effect was also shown to be similar in the city of Zabrze, as well as in the 
whole Silesia region.
CONCLUSIONS: The Health Impact Assessments tools developed by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) can help public health experts make decisions in order to 
improve the health of populations living in particular regions of Europe.

Kingdom.

OBJECTIVES: . Recent proposals for value-based assessment, made by the National 
Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, 
recommended that burden of illness (BOI) should replace end of life (EOL) as a 
factor for consideration when deciding on new health technologies. This article 
reports on a study eliciting societal preferences for 1) BOI from a medical 
condition, defined as quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss due to premature 
mortality and prospective morbidity, and 2) EOL, defined as expected life 
expectancy of less than 2 years and expected life expectancy gain from new 
treatment of 3 months or more.
METHODS: . A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted with an online UK 
general population sample. Respondents chose whether they thought the health 
service should treat patient group A or B: life expectancy and health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) with current treatment or life expectancy and HRQOL 
gains from new treatment, respectively. These attributes were used to derive 
BOI, QALY gain, and EOL. The respondents' choices were analyzed using 
conditional logistic regression with a range of specifications examined, 
including BOI or EOL, QALY gain and QALY gain squared, and robustness. QALY 
weights were estimated.
RESULTS: . The sample of 3669 respondents was representative of the UK 
population for age and sex. QALY gain had a positive and significant coefficient 
across all models. QALY gain squared term was negative and significant across 
all models, indicating a diminishing marginal social value from QALY gains. When 
included, the BOI coefficient was generally small, positive, and significant, 
but this was not consistent across the different life expectancy variants. EOL 
was always positive and significant.
CONCLUSIONS: . The social value of a QALY gain is not equal between recipients 
but depends on whether they are end of life, and it may depend on the 
prospective burden of illness.
