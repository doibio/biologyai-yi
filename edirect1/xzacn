Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2005 Feb 15;142(4):I53.

BACKGROUND: Although clopidogrel plus aspirin is more effective than aspirin 
alone in preventing subsequent vascular events in patients with unstable angina, 
the cost-effectiveness of this combination has yet to be examined in this 
high-risk population.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel plus aspirin 
compared with aspirin alone.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients with unstable angina and electrocardiographic 
changes or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. time horizon: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Combination therapy with clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, plus aspirin, 325 
mg/d, for 1 year, followed by aspirin monotherapy, was compared with lifelong 
aspirin therapy, 325 mg/d.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs, life expectancy in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Patients treated with aspirin alone lived 9.51 
QALYs after their initial event and incurred expenses of 127,700 dollars; the 
addition of clopidogrel increased life expectancy to 9.61 QALYs and costs to 
129,300 dollars. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for clopidogrel plus 
aspirin compared with aspirin alone was 15,400 dollars per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The analysis of 1 year of therapy was robust to 
all sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, fewer than 
3% of simulations resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios over 50,000 dollars per 
QALY. The cost-effectiveness of longer combination therapy depends critically on 
the balance of thrombotic event rates, durable efficacy, and the increased 
bleeding rate in patients taking clopidogrel.
LIMITATIONS: This analysis may not apply to patients with severe heart failure, 
those undergoing long-term anticoagulant therapy, those recently managed with 
revascularization, or those undergoing short-term treatment with glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with high-risk acute coronary syndromes, 1 year of 
therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin results in greater life expectancy than 
aspirin alone, at a cost within the traditional limits of cost-effectiveness. 
The durable efficacy of clopidogrel relative to the risk for hemorrhage should 
be further explored before more protracted therapy can be recommended.

The unfortunate influence of the weather on the rate of ageing: why human 
caloric restriction or its emulation may only extend life expectancy by 2-3 
years.

Much research interest, and recently even commercial interest, has been 
predicated on the assumption that reasonably closely-related species--humans and 
mice, for example--should, in principle, respond to ageing-retarding 
interventions with an increase in maximum lifespan roughly proportional to their 
control lifespan (that without the intervention). Here, it is argued that the 
best-studied life-extending manipulations of mice are examples of a category 
that is highly unlikely to follow this rule, and more likely to exhibit only a 
similar absolute increase in maximum lifespan from one species to the next, 
independent of the species' control lifespan. That category--reduction in 
dietary calories or in the organism's ability to metabolize or sense them--is 
widely recognized to extend lifespan as an evolutionary adaptation to transient 
starvation in the wild, a situation which alters the organism's optimal 
partitioning of resources between maintenance and reproduction. What has been 
generally overlooked is that the extent of the evolutionary pressure to maintain 
adaptability to a given duration of starvation varies with the frequency of that 
duration, something which is--certainly for terrestrial animals and less 
directly for others--determined principally by the weather. The pattern of 
starvation that the weather imposes is suggested here to be of a sort that will 
tend to cause all terrestrial animals, even those as far apart phylogenetically 
as nematodes and mice, to possess the ability to live a similar maximum absolute 
(rather than proportional) amount longer when food is short than when it is 
plentiful. This generalization is strikingly in line with available data, 
leading (given the increasing implausibility of further extending human mean but 
not maximum lifespan in the industrialized world) to the biomedically and 
commercially sobering conclusion that interventions which manipulate caloric 
intake or its sensing are unlikely ever to confer more than 2 or 3 years' 
increase in human mean or maximum lifespan at the most.

Improved physical performance in older adults undertaking a short-term programme 
of high-velocity resistance training.

Henwood TR(1), Taaffe DR.

Author information:
(1)School of Human Movement Studies, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of 
Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

BACKGROUND: The age-related loss of muscle power in older adults is greater than 
that of muscle strength and is associated with a decline in physical 
performance.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a short-term high-velocity varied 
resistance training programme on physical performance in healthy 
community-dwelling adults aged 60-80 years.
METHODS: Subjects undertook exercise (EX; n=15) or maintained customary activity 
(controls, CON; n=10) for 8 weeks. The EX group trained 2 days/week using 
machine weights for three sets of eight repetitions at 35, 55, and 75% of their 
one-repetition maximum (the maximal weight that an individual can lift once with 
acceptable form) for seven upper- and lower-body exercises using explosive 
concentric movements.
RESULTS: Fourteen EX and 10 CON subjects completed the study. Dynamic muscle 
strength significantly increased (p=0.001) in the EX group for all exercises 
(from 21.4 +/- 9.6 to 82.0 +/- 59.2%, mean +/- SD) following training, as did 
knee extension power (p <0.01). Significant improvement occurred for the EX 
group in the floor rise to standing (10.4 +/- 11.5%, p=0.004), usual 6-metre 
walk (6.6 +/- 8.2%, p=0.010), repeated chair rise (10.4 +/- 15.6%, p=0.013), and 
lift and reach (25.6 +/- 12.1%, p=0.002) performance tasks but not in the CON 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Progressive resistance training that incorporates rapid 
rate-of-force development movements may be safely undertaken in healthy older 
adults and results in significant gains in muscle strength, muscle power, and 
physical performance. Such improvements could prolong functional independence 
and improve the quality of life.

[HIV infection and AIDS in advanced age. Epidemiological and clinical issues, 
and therapeutic and management problems].

[Article in Italian]

Manfredi R(1), Calza L.

Malattie Infettive, Universita degli Studi Alma Mater, Policlinico 
S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.

The life expectancy of HIV-infected patients treated with highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has increased and now approaches that of the 
general population, while also the definition of AIDS has lost most of its 
epidemiological and clinical significance, due to the immune recovery obtained 
by large-scale administration of potent antiretroviral combinations. The 
prolonged survival of subjects with HIV infection, and the late recognition of 
patients with occult disease, will contribute to a progressive increase in 
disease incidence in patients aged 50-60 years or more in the near future. 
Unfortunately, the large majority of therapeutic trials addressed to assess and 
compare novel antiretroviral molecules and associations, as well as studies 
regarding antimicrobial chemotherapy of prophylaxis of AIDS-related 
opportunistic infections, have just advanced age and/or underlying chronic 
disorders (i.e. liver or kidney failure) among main exclusion criteria, or do 
not allow the extrapolation of data regarding older subjects, compared with 
younger ones. The limited data available until now show that antiretroviral 
therapy has a similar virological efficacy in the elderly compared with younger 
patients. However, immune reconstitution is often slower and blunted according 
to age progression, although some well-designed studies have shown that the 
thymic function (which controls most quantitative and functional immune 
recovery) can be preserved in adults and even in advanced age. When facing older 
subjects, the Infectious Disease specialist has to pay careful attention to any 
chronic end-organ disorders, all possible pharmacological interactions, and 
overwhelming toxicity due to underlying drug therapies: all these issues may 
significantly interfere with HAART efficacy, patients' adherence to prescribed 
treatments, and frequency and severity of untoward events. Guidelines for 
antiretroviral therapy and treatment and prophylaxis of AIDS-associated 
illnesses should be appropriately updated, given the novel features due to the 
emerging increase in the mean age of the HIV-infected patient population.

[Evidence nursing of menopausal women: telephone intervention services].

[Article in Chinese]

With rapid innovation in medical techniques and continuous improvements in 
public sanitation, people now live much longer than they used to. According to 
the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, the average life expectancy of women 
increased from 60.26 years in 1952 to 78.48 years in 2002. As the average life 
expectancy of women increases, the population of menopausal women also tends to 
increase year by year. For that reason, the government sees the health care of 
menopausal women as an important aspect of healthcare policy. With the health 
care environment constantly changing, it appears that simply relying on 
traditional experiences and subjective beliefs to do such nursing work cannot 
satisfy the needs of patients. Consequently, effective methods to apply research 
results to clinical practice has become a crucial goal of current evidence 
nursing. Rosswurn and Larrabee (1999) proposed six steps of change in the 
clinical nursing model. In this paper, we used this model to evaluate the 
effects of telephone intervention services for menopausal women.

Increasing socio-economic inequalities in life expectancy and QALYs in Sweden 
1980-1997.

Institutet, Sweden. kristina.burstrom@sll.se

The aim of this study was to estimate the change in socio-economic differences 
in life expectancy and in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for men and women 
at different ages, in Sweden 1980 to 1997. We used data from the Swedish Survey 
of Living Conditions (the ULF survey), which is linked to mortality data, to 
estimate the life expectancy in different socio-economic groups in 1980 and 1997 
(n=100 868). Health state scores were obtained by mapping responses to selected 
ULF survey interview questions into the generic health-related quality of life 
measure EQ-5D, using the UK EQ-5D index tariff (n=34 447). For 20-year-old men 
the difference in life expectancy between the highest (higher non-manual) and 
the lowest socio-economic group (unskilled manual) was 2.11 years in 1980 and 
3.79 years in 1997. The corresponding figures for 20-year-old women were 1.56 in 
1980 and 2.15 in 1997. The difference in QALYs between the highest and the 
lowest socio-economic group increased from 5.76 QALYs in 1980 to 7.06 QALYs in 
1997 for 20-year-old men, and from 4.14 QALYs in 1980 to 5.66 QALYs in 1997 for 
20-year-old women. The widening socio-economic inequalities over time were more 
stable for men than for women. We conclude that our results suggest that the 
socio-economic inequality in health has increased between 1980 and 1997 in 
Sweden.

Empirical investigation of experimental design properties of discrete choice 
experiments in health care.

University of Technology, Sydney, Australia. rosalie.viney@chere.uts.edu.au

Experimental design is critical to valid inference from the results of discrete 
choice experiments (DCEs). In health economics, DCEs have placed limited 
emphasis on experimental design, typically employing relatively small fractional 
factorial designs, which allow only strictly linear additive utility functions 
to be estimated. The extensive literature on optimal experimental design outside 
health economics has proposed potentially desirable design properties, such as 
orthogonality, utility balance and level balance. However, there are trade-offs 
between these properties and emphasis on some properties may increase the random 
variability in responses, potentially biasing parameter estimates.This study 
investigates empirically the design properties of DCEs, in particular, the 
optimal method of combining alternatives in the choice set. The study involves a 
forced choice between two alternatives (treatment and non-treatment for a 
hypothetical health care condition), each with three, four-level, 
alternative-specific attributes. Three experimental design approaches are 
investigated: a standard six-attribute, orthogonal main effects design; a design 
that combines alternatives to achieve utility balance, ensuring no alternatives 
are dominated; and a design that combines alternatives randomly. The different 
experimental designs did not impact on the underlying parameter estimates, but 
imposing utility balance increases the random variability of responses.

Oslo, Norway.

PIK3CA belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) family, which play 
an important role in proliferation, adherence, transformation and cell survival 
through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Somatic activating mutations of this 
gene have recently been detected in several types of cancers. In the present 
study, 109 advanced ovarian carcinomas were analyzed for PIK3CA mutations in 
exon 9 and exon 20 by direct sequencing. Activating missense mutations were 
observed in 4 of the 109 tumors in addition to one variant leading no change of 
the PIK3CA protein. Two of the cases with mutations were mucinous and clear cell 
tumors, suggesting that PIK3CA mutations are more common in these rare 
histological types.

PURPOSE: To review different types of economic analyses commonly found in 
healthcare literature, discuss methodologic considerations in framing economic 
analyses, identify useful resources for economic evaluations, and describe the 
current and potential roles of standardized nursing terminologies in providing 
cost and outcome data for economic analysis.
DATA SOURCES: The Advanced Billing Concepts Code Resource-based Relative Value 
Scale and Nursing Outcomes Classification.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Using case studies, the applicability of standardized nursing 
terminologies in cost-effectiveness analysis is demonstrated. While there is 
potential to inform specific questions, comparisons across analyses are limited 
because of the many outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Including a standardized quality-of-life measure in nursing 
terminologies would allow for the calculation of accepted outcome measures and 
dollars per quality adjusted life years gained.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The nurse's ability to assess and contribute to all 
aspects of rigorous economic evidence is an essential competency for responsible 
practice.

Several recent important studies have clearly shown that a low physical fitness 
represents a potent risk factor and even a predictor of both cardiovascular and 
all-causes morbidity and mortality. As a consequence, physical fitness 
assessment should be performed at the clinical level since, when properly 
assessed, it is a highly valuable health and life expectancy indicator. Based on 
the results of fitness assessment in a particular person and knowing his/her 
life style and daily physical activity, an individually adapted training program 
can be prescribed. This training program will allow that person to develop 
his/her maximal physical potential while improving his/her physical and mental 
health and attenuating the deleterious consequences of aging. In fact, physical 
exercise is today proposed as a highly effective means to treat and prevent 
major morbidity and mortality causes in industrialized countries. Most of these 
causes are associated with the aging process. In order to be effective, this 
type of intervention should be directed to improve the aerobic capacity and 
strength. In addition, it should be complemented with work directed to improve 
the general coordination and flexibility. Finally, diet optimization and use of 
nutritional supplements and legal ergogenic aids are key elements to improve the 
functional capacity and health, all of which is synonymous of anti-aging 
interventions.

We perform an econometric analysis of the effect of new drug launches on 
longevity, using data from the IMS Health Drug Launches database and the WHO 
Mortality Database. Under conservative assumptions, our estimates imply that the 
average annual increase in life expectancy of the entire population resulting 
from new drug launches is about one week, and that the incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (new drug expenditure per person per year divided by the 
increase in life-years per person per year attributable to new drug launches) is 
about $6750--far lower than most estimates of the value of a statistical 
life-year.

Shuttling between species for pathways of lifespan regulation: a central role 
for the vitellogenin gene family?

Studies to find genes that affect maximum lifespan aim at identifying important 
determinants of ageing that may be universal across species. Model organisms 
show insulin signalling can play an important role in ageing. In view of insulin 
resistance, such loci can also be important in human ageing and health. The 
study of long-lived humans and their children points to the relevance of 
lipoprotein profiles and particle size for longevity. If ageing pathways are 
conserved, then the genes mediating such pathways may also be conserved. 
Cross-species sequence comparisons of potential longevity loci may reveal 
whether the pathways that they represent are central themes in lifespan 
regulation. Using bioinformatic tools, we performed a sequence comparison of the 
genes involved in lipid metabolism identified in humans as potential longevity 
loci. This analysis revealed that lipid storage and transport may be a common 
theme related to longevity in humans, honeybees and nematodes. Here, the 
vitellogenin family emerges as a potential key connection between lipid 
metabolism and the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway.

[Effective treatment strategy in elderly breast cancer patients].

[Article in Hungarian]

Boér K(1).

Author information:
(1)Szent Margit Kórház Onkológiai Osztály, Budapest. katalin.boer@oncology.hu

INTRODUCTION: High frequency of cancer in older people and the improvements in 
life expectancy do not allow older age to be a barrier to treatment. The age is 
one of the risk factors for breast cancer development, one third of all cases 
occur in women older than 70 years.
AIM: To provide an overview of the available information on the main issues in 
the field of surgery, radiotherapy and medical approaches to the treatment of 
breast cancer in the elderly.
METHOD: The author discusses the treatment of breast cancer in the elderly, 
based on the data of literature.
RESULTS: The assessment of any patient is the first step in the treatment 
process, performance status is more important than age. In older women a correct 
evaluation includes not only the basic medical history and the cancer staging, 
but also a detailed assessment of health and environment that may interfere with 
the therapeutic approach of the patient. Age is not a limitation for surgery, 
without any comorbidity it is safe, and operative mortality is low. The body 
self-image is important for most old women, they also wish to keep their 
breasts, so a conservative surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy should be offered 
to all, as long as the stage permits it. The selection of patients who are 
candidates for axillary dissection is based on selective lymph sentinel node 
technique which provides an optimal nodal staging with a minimal morbidity. The 
results of radiotherapy are as good as in younger patients, elderly women 
tolerate radiotherapy well. The inability to travel to the radiation facility is 
often the reason for omitting the radiation treatment and to choose a modified 
mastectomy. A promising alternative to the standard radiation treatment is the 
concept of intraoperative radiotherapy. Breast cancer in the elderly women is 
more likely to be well differentiated tumour, containing oestrogen and 
progesterone receptors. Based on these favourable prognostic factors, endocrine 
therapy is the standard treatment in adjuvant and metastatic setting for older 
women. When all hormonal options have been exhausted, elderly women should be 
treated with chemotherapy. Older patients often use several drugs concomitantly, 
and this polypharmacy may lead to possible clinically significant changes in the 
cytotoxic agent pharmacology. Supportive care can improve compliance of patients 
to chemotherapy. The introduction of oral and weekly applied cytotoxic 
treatments will allow a broader spectrum of patients to benefit from 
chemotherapy, particularly those with a poorer performance status.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multidimensional geriatric evaluation permits a better 
selection of the best and individualized therapeutic decision for each patient. 
The growing number of treatment options in the elderly breast cancer patients 
will lead to an increase in survival and contribute to an improvement in their 
quality of life.

Microbiological, biochemical and sensory assessment of mussels (Mytilus 
galloprovincialis) stored under modified atmosphere packaging.

University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.

AIMS: To determine the microbiological, biochemical and sensory changes of 
mussels during storage under aerobic, vacuum packaging (VP) and modified 
atmosphere packaging (MAP) conditions at 4 degrees C, and to determine 
shelf-life of mussels under the same packaging conditions using the above 
assessment parameters.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Aqua-cultured mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were 
obtained from a local culture farm, packaged aerobically under VP and MAP 
(50%/50% CO2/N2: M1, 80%/20% CO2/N2: M2, 40%/30%/30% CO2/N2/O2: M3), and stored 
at 4 degrees C. Quality evaluation was carried out using microbiological, 
chemical and sensory analyses. Microbiological results revealed that the M2 and 
VP delayed microbial growth compared with that of air-packaged samples. The 
effect was more pronounced for total viable count (TVC), Pseudomonas spp., 
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and H2S-producing bacteria. TVC was reduced by 
0.9-1.0, Pseudomonas spp. by 0.7-0.8, LAB by 1.0-2.2, H2S-producing bacteria by 
0.7-1.2. Enterobacteriaceae were not significantly affected by MAP conditions. 
Of the chemical indices determined, the total volatile basic nitrogen and 
trimethylamine nitrogen values remained lower than the proposed acceptability 
limits of 35 mg N 100 g(-1) and 12 mg N 100 g(-1), respectively, after 15 days 
of storage. Both the VP and air-packaged mussel samples exceeded these limits. 
The thiobarbituric acid value of all MAP and VP mussels remained lower than the 
proposed acceptability limit of 1 mg malondialdehyde kg(-1). The air-packaged 
samples exceeded this limit. All samples retained desirable sensory 
characteristics during the first 8 days of storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on odour and taste evaluation, the M1 and M3 samples remained 
acceptable until ca day 11-12, the M2 samples remained acceptable until ca day 
14-15 days while the VP and air-packaged mussel samples remained acceptable 
until ca days 10-11 and 8-9 of storage respectively. Based primarily on sensory, 
but also on biochemical and microbiological parameters determined, M2 gas 
mixture was the most effective for mussel preservation achieving a shelf-life of 
ca 14-15 days.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: MAP (M2) can be used to increase the

OBJECTIVE: To examine safety and tolerability findings as primary endpoints, and 
efficacy outcomes as secondary endpoints, of solifenacin treatment over a period 
of up to 1 year. Long-term efficacy in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) 
syndrome depends in part on the patient's persistence with pharmacologic 
therapy. Agents with a favourable therapeutic index supporting high levels of 
patient satisfaction and persistence are needed.
METHODS: The present study was a 40-week open-label extension of two 12-week, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of solifenacin treatment in patients 
with OAB. Patients who completed the 12-week studies were offered participation 
in the open-label extension study. All patients who entered the open-label 
extension study initially received solifenacin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks, after 
which a flexible dosing regimen allowed patients to individualise their 
treatment (5 mg or 10 mg) at each of the 3 study visits. Safety and tolerability 
assessments (the primary variable) included adverse event reporting. Efficacy 
data were collected from micturition diaries completed at weeks 16, 28, 40, and 
52.
RESULTS: Ninety-one percent (1637/1802) of patients who completed the two 
12-week randomised studies chose to participate in the long-term open-label 
extension study. A total of 81% of patients completed 40 weeks of open-label 
treatment. Solifenacin treatment was safe and well tolerated, and rates of 
anticholinergic side effects were relatively low. Only 4.7% of patients 
discontinued treatment owing to adverse events. Improvements in major symptoms 
of OAB were noted for all patients for up to 52 weeks of treatment. In patients 
randomised to solifenacin in the double-blind studies, there were small 
incremental improvements in all efficacy parameters (reductions in episodes per 
24 hours of urgency, reductions in frequency and urge incontinence, and 
increases in volume voided per micturition) over the course of the extension 
study. Efficacy was confirmed when outcomes were assessed as a function of total 
solifenacin exposure. Patient satisfaction with solifenacin tolerability (85%) 
and efficacy (74%) were high. These results indicate that long-term treatment 
with solifenacin was well tolerated and associated with improvements in efficacy 
parameters based on patient diary data recorded over the 12-month treatment 
period. Moreover, the high level of patient satisfaction reported appeared to 
correlate well with the quantified improvements in key symptoms demonstrated in 
this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term therapy with solifenacin resulted in a favourable 
tolerability profile, and was associated with improvements in efficacy 
parameters based on diary data recorded over a 12-month period. This balance of 
tolerability and efficacy with solifenacin was associated with excellent 
persistence with therapy. These results suggest that solifenacin may be useful 
for the long-term treatment of the chronic symptoms associated with OAB.

SIRT1 functionally interacts with the metabolic regulator and transcriptional 
coactivator PGC-1{alpha}.

In lower organisms, increased expression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2 
augments lifespan. The mechanism through which this life extension is mediated 
remains incompletely understood. Here we have examined the cellular effects of 
overexpression of SIRT1, the closest mammalian ortholog of Sir2. In PC12 cells, 
increased expression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 reduces cellular 
oxygen consumption by approximately 25%. We further demonstrate that SIRT1 
expression can alter the transcriptional activity of the mitochondrial 
biogenesis coactivator PGC-1alpha. In addition, SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha directly 
interact and can be co-immunoprecipitated as a molecular complex. A single amino 
acid mutation in the putative ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of SIRT1 inhibits 
the interaction of SIRT1 with PGC-1alpha but does not effect the interaction of 
SIRT1 with either p53 or Foxo3a. We further show that PGC-1alpha is acetylated 
in vivo. This acetylation is augmented by treatment with the SIRT1 inhibitor 
nicotinamide or by expression of the transcriptional coactivator p300. Finally 
we demonstrate that SIRT1 catalyzes PGC-1alpha deacetylation both in vitro and 
in vivo. These results provide a direct link between the sirtuins, a family of 
proteins linked to lifespan determination and PGC-1alpha, a coactivator that 
regulates cellular metabolism.

    Evid Based Cardiovasc Med. 2005 Sep;9(3):230-3.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the cost effectiveness of nurse led secondary prevention 
clinics for coronary heart disease based on four years' follow up of a 
randomised controlled trial.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: 19 general practices in north east Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: 1343 patients (673 in intervention group and 670 in control group, 
as originally randomised) aged under 80 years with a diagnosis of coronary heart 
disease but without terminal illness or dementia and not housebound.
INTERVENTION: Nurse led clinics to promote medical and lifestyle components of 
secondary prevention.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of clinics; overall costs to health service; and 
cost per life year and per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, expressed 
as incremental gain in intervention group compared with control group.
RESULTS: The cost of the intervention (clinics and drugs) was 136 pounds 
sterling (254 dollars; 195 euros) per patient higher (1998-9 prices) in the 
intervention group, but the difference in other NHS costs, although lower for 
the intervention group, was not statistically significant. Overall, 28 fewer 
deaths occurred in the intervention group leading to a gain in mean life years 
per patient of 0.110 and of 0.124 QALYs. The incremental cost per life year 
saved was 1236 pounds sterling and that per QALY was 1097 pounds sterling.
CONCLUSION: Nurse led clinics for the secondary prevention of coronary heart 
disease in primary care seem to be cost effective compared with most 
interventions in health care, with the main gains in life years saved.

Incidence and evolution of inferior alveolar nerve lesions following lower third 
molar extraction.

Queral-Godoy E(1), Valmaseda-Castellón E, Berini-Aytés L, Gay-Escoda C.

(1)School of Dentistry of the University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

OBJECTIVES: To calculate the incidence of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) damage 
due to lower third molar extraction and to describe the evolution of IAN 
sensitivity and the prognosis of IAN damage based on preoperative data.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 4995 lower third molar extractions in 
3513 outpatients.
RESULTS: Fifty-five extractions (1.1%) resulted in IAN impairment. Cox 
regression analysis showed age to be a risk factor for the persistence of IAN 
injury due to lower third molar extraction. The sensation recovery rate was 
higher in the first 3 months. Fifty percent of the patients showed full recovery 
after 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of IAN impairment following lower third molar extraction 
recover within 6 months, though in some cases recovery takes more than 1 year. 
Older patients are at an increased risk of incomplete recovery of chin and lip 
sensibility after third molar extraction.

AIMS: To determine the economic benefit of losartan versus atenolol in patients 
with essential hypertension from the perspective of the Swiss healthcare system.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of losartan versus atenolol in the 
treatment of hypertension was analyzed by applying the results of the LIFE study 
to the Swiss healthcare system using a decision analysis framework. The 
cost-effectiveness shows the losartan cohort to provide an additional life 
expectancy of 0.05 years per patient compared to the atenolol cohort, over a 
mean follow-up period of 4.8 years. Losartan therapy in hypertensive patients 
produced net cost savings of CHF 24 per patient and per 4.8 years compared to 
atenolol from the perspective of the Swiss health care system. This result was 
robust after varying costs of medication, stroke, myocardial infarction and life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The use of a losartan-based regimen in hypertensive patients with 
left ventricular hypertrophy in Switzerland is net cost-saving compared with a 
atenolol-based regimen.

[Geriatric problems in the perioperative management of surgical interventions].

Improved healthcare and longer life expectancy have led to more and overall, 
healthier older patients. As a consequence, we now see more surgical 
complications attributable to an ever-increasing spectrum of the physiologic 
changes of aging. These include functional decline, psychiatric as well as 
medical co-morbidities, medication effects and peri-operative environmental 
changes. To maintain high patient care standards in geriatric operative 
patients, surgeons face challenges in peri-operative care (co-morbidities), 
anesthesia (intra-operative circulatory depression, cardiac insufficiency and 
limited organ reserve), and intensive care (cardiopulmonary surveillance and 
delirium). In contrast to the normally temporary surgical period, 
interdisciplinary approaches are essential during extended peri-operative, 
convalescent, rehabilitation and follow-up phases of care in the geriatric 
patient. This will require competency in the realm of geriatrics, on behalf of 
the treating surgeon who, as a result, will become increasingly more specialized 
in the future. This article addresses current epidemiology and symptomatology of 
particular diseases, and as well, offers treatment suggestions with explanations 
of geriatric pathophysiology and functional decline from a clinically relevant 
perspective. This review highlights the increased difficulty in treatment of 
multiple disease processes in the elderly as a result of natural decline in 
function of all organ systems.

A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of the cost-effectiveness of palliative 
therapies for patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer.

Shenfine J(1), McNamee P, Steen N, Bond J, Griffin SM.

Author information:
(1)Northern Oesophago-Gastric Unit, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon 
Tyne, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To compare whether treatment with self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) 
is more cost-effective than treatment with conventional modalities in patients 
with inoperable oesophageal cancer. Quality of life effects were also 
considered.
DESIGN: A multicentre pragmatic, randomised controlled trial with health 
economic analysis.
SETTING: Seven NHS hospitals selected to represent a cross-section of UK 
hospitals in terms of facilities and staffing.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients attending the centres with oesophageal cancer deemed 
unsuitable for surgery were assessed for inclusion in the main trial; 217 
patients were randomised. A health state utilities substudy was also performed 
in 71 patients who had previously received curative surgery for oesophageal 
cancer.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomised to one of four treatment groups 
within two study arms. Assessments were performed at enrolment, 1 week following 
treatment and thereafter at 6-weekly intervals until death, with prospective 
data collection on complications and survival. Structured interviews to elicit 
patient preferences to health states and treatments were performed in a 
substudy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dysphagia grade and quality of life were examined at 6 
weeks. Survival, resources consumed from randomisation to death and 
quality-adjusted life-years were also considered.
RESULTS: There was no difference in cost or effectiveness between SEMS and 
non-SEMS therapies, and 18-mm SEMS had equal effectiveness to, but less 
associated pain than, 24-mm SEMS. Rigid intubation was associated with a worse 
quality of swallowing and increased late morbidity. Bipolar electrocoagulation 
and ethanol tumour necrosis were poor in primary palliation. A survival 
advantage was found for non-stent therapies, but there was a significant delay 
to treatment. The length of stay accounts for the majority of the cost to the 
NHS. Patients were found to have distinct individual treatment preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: It was suggested that rigid tubes and 24-mm SEMS should no longer 
be recommended and bipolar electrocoagulation and ethanol tumour necrosis should 
not be used for primary palliation. The choice in palliation would between 
non-stent and 18-mm SEMS treatments, with non-stent therapies being made more 
available and accessible to reduce delay. A multidisciplinary team approach to 
palliation is also suggested. A randomised controlled clinical trial of 18-mm 
SEMS versus non-stent therapies with survival and quality of life end-points 
would be helpful, as would an audit of palliative patient admissions to 
determine the reasons and need for inpatient hospital care, with a view to 
implementing cycle-associated change to reduce inpatient stay. A study of delays 
in palliative radiotherapy treatment is also suggested, with a view to 
implementing cycle-associated change to reduce waiting time.

When is concomitant aortic valve replacement indicated in patients with mild to 
moderate stenosis undergoing coronary revascularization?

Foundation/F24, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. gillinom@ccf.org

Mild to moderate aortic stenosis is a common finding in patients presenting for 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and its management is controversial. 
However, review of available data suggests a surgical strategy for these 
patients. Recent data demonstrate that 1) progression of aortic stenosis is more 
rapid in those with leaflet calcification; 2) the addition of aortic valve 
replacement to CABG in patients with mild to moderate stenosis does not increase 
hospital mortality when compared with bypass surgery alone; 3) hospital 
mortality for aortic valve replacement after previous bypass surgery has 
declined in recent years; 4) aortic valve replacement places the patient at risk 
for prosthesis-related complications; 5) the limited 10-year survival (competing 
risk of death) leaves only a minority of individuals with mild aortic stenosis 
alive and eligible for aortic valve replacement 10 years after bypass surgery; 
and 6) combined aortic valve replacement and CABG confers a survival benefit in 
those with moderate aortic stenosis but not in those with mild aortic stenosis. 
Therefore, in the coronary artery bypass patient with moderate aortic stenosis, 
leaflet calcification, and life expectancy greater than 5 years, concomitant 
aortic valve replacement is advised. In contrast, aortic valve replacement is 
rarely indicated in those with mild aortic stenosis.

Local expression of GH and IGF-1 in the hippocampus of GH-deficient long-lived 
mice.

Springfield, IL 62794, USA.

Beneficial effects of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) on the development and function of the central nervous system are well 
documented. In spite of primary deficiency of GH and secondary IGF-1 deficiency, 
Ames dwarf mice live considerably longer than normal animals, exhibit apparently 
normal cognitive functions and maintain them into advanced age. In an attempt to 
reconcile these findings, we have examined local expression of GH and IGF-1 in 
the hippocampus of normal and Ames dwarf mice. We found that both hippocampal GH 
and IGF-1 protein levels are increased and the corresponding mRNAs are normal in 
Ames dwarf as compared with normal mice. Increased phosphorylation of Akt and 
cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) were detected in the 
hippocampus of Ames dwarf mice. Our results suggest that increase in hippocampal 
GH and IGF-1 protein expression and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt-CREB 
signal transduction cascade might contribute to the maintenance of cognitive 
function and is likely to be responsible for the integrity of neuronal 
structure, and maintenance of youthful levels of cognitive function in these 
long-lived mice during aging.

Quality-adjusted life years was a poor predictor of women's willingness to pay 
in acute and chronic conditions: results of a survey.

Athens, GA 30602-2354, USA. dfranic@rx.uga.edu

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and willingness to pay (WTP) in acute and chronic conditions.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Face-to-face interviews were used to collect data in a 
convenience sample of women. Participants completed one interview evaluating 
preferences for an acute condition, post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting 
(PCNV), and the other interview for a chronic condition (breast cancer). 
Preferences were elicited for QALYs using visual analogue scale (VAS), and 
standard gamble in addition to WTP. Because QALYs and WTP are purportedly based 
on the same underlying theoretical foundations, WTP was regressed onto change in 
QALYs, age, income, and health status.
RESULTS: Regression analysis reported statistically significant models for all 
breast cancer (P < .001) and PCNV (P < .05) conditions tested. However, QALY was 
not a significant predictor of WTP.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate QALYs was a poor predictor of WTP 
for the conditions tested. Linear combinations of change in QALYs, age, income, 
and health status were a better predictor of WTP for chronic than acute 
conditions. This can be attributed to violations of underlying assumptions in 
measurement of QALYs with acute conditions and to problems with the use of WTP 
with chronic conditions.

Author information:
(1)Hohenstein Research Institute, Germany. d.hoefer@hohenstein.de

The background of the development of i-wear for health care and wellness are two 
actual trends: The wellness trend with its expectation to stay fit and healthy 
and the increasing life expectancy of the Europeans and the challenges, which 
are resulting thereof for the medicine and the technology that goes with it. 
Already in 2040 the amount of people over 60 years in Europe will amount to 40% 
of the entire population [1,2]. In recent years the co-operation of physicians, 
biologists, physiologists, engineers for electronics and information 
technologies and textile scientists has produced a multitude of innovative 
applications for textiles, especially in the medical and wellness field. This 
presentation will cover the state of the art and some future aspects of 
textile-integrated solutions for health and wellness services, with intelligent 
application forms or integrated electronics (i-wear), which are an increasing 
market for textiles.
