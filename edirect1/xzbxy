Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with chronic bacterial airway infections 
leading to lung insufficiency and decreased life expectancy. Staphylococcus 
aureus is one of the most prevalent pathogens isolated from the airways of CF 
patients. Mucoid colony morphology has been described for Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, the most common pathogen in CF, but not for S. aureus. From the 
airways of 8 of 313 CF patients (2.5%) mucoid S. aureus isolates (n = 115) were 
cultured with a mean persistence of 29 months (range 1 month, 126 months). In 
contrast to non-mucoid S. aureus, mucoid isolates were strong biofilm formers. 
The upstream region of the ica operon, which encodes the proteins responsible 
for the synthesis of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), of mucoid 
isolates was sequenced. Spa-types of mucoid and non-mucoid strains were 
identical, but differed between patients. Mucoid isolates carried a 5 bp 
deletion in the intergenic region between icaR and icaA. During long-term 
persistence, from two patients subsequent non-mucoid isolates (n = 12) with 5 bp 
deletions were cultured, which did not produce biofilm. Sequencing of the entire 
ica operon identified compensatory mutations in various ica-genes including icaA 
(n = 7), icaD (n = 3) and icaC (n = 2). Six sequential isolates of each of these 
two patients with non-mucoid and mucoid phenotypes were subjected to whole 
genome sequencing revealing a very close relationship of the individual 
patient's isolates. Transformation of strains with vectors expressing the 
respective wild-type genes restored mucoidy. In contrast to the non-mucoid 
phenotype, mucoid strains were protected against neutrophilic killing and 
survived better under starvation conditions. In conclusion, the special 
conditions present in CF airways seem to facilitate ongoing mutations in the ica 
operon during S. aureus persistence.

[ESC guidelines 2015 pulmonary hypertension: diagnosis and treatment].

[Article in German]

Opitz C, Rosenkranz S, Ghofrani HA, Grünig E, Klose H, Olschewski H, Hoeper M.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by an increase in PAPmean > 25 mmHg 
associated with a reduced life expectancy. Recent advances in the management of 
these patients provided the basis for the updated recommendations of the 2015 
joint guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European 
Respiratory Society (ERS) on the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary 
hypertension. The updated version includes important modifications with regards 
to hemodynamic definitions, clinical classification and diagnostic assessment of 
patients with PH. In addition, risk stratification and PH treatment were 
profoundly modified, introducing novel drugs and improved treatment strategies 
such as early combination therapy. Finally, the new ESC /ERS guidelines provide 
formal recommendations for the management of PH due to left heart or chronic 
lung disease and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and define 
criteria for specialized PH expert centers.

[Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with kidney disease].

[Article in German]

Quack I, Westenfeld R.

Patients with kidney disease have a significantly increased cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality. Especially diabetics have an increased risk to develop 
renal insufficiency and cardiovascular events. Two recent studies show that the 
SGLT2 inhibitor Empagliflozin and the GLP1 agonist Liraglutid are able to lower 
the cardiovascular risk of type2 diabetics with renal insufficiency. Recent 
observations suggest that bradycardia and asystole are main triggers for sudden 
cardiac death in patients with chronic kidney disease. In line with these 
results registry data failed to confirm benefits of cardioverters/defibrillators 
in hemodialysis patients. Whether cardiac resynchronization therapy may slower 
pathomechanisms of cardiomyopathy in patients with chronic kidney disease still 
needs to be confirmed in prospective trials. Taken together implementation of 
device therapy in hemodialysis patients should integrate indications of current 
guidelines with individual patient risks and life expectancy. Everolimus-eluting 
stents have shown superior results compared to bare metal stents in terms of 
ischemia-driven target-lesion-revascularization in patients with chronic kidney 
disease in a prospective trial. These results were corroborated by registry data 
reporting survival benefit associated with the use of drug-eluting stents in 
patients with chronic renal disease.

OBJECTIVE: To describe current patterns in initiation and cessation of proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in intensive care 
units, and to assess the costs associated with inappropriate 
(non-evidence-based) SUP.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective observational study in five ICUs 
in Western Australia. We assessed the medical records of consecutive patients 
admitted to the ICUs between September 2013 and January 2015. Patients aged < 18 
years were excluded.
RESULTS: We included 531 patients in the study. Of the 184 patients in whom PPIs 
were initiated for SUP in the ICU, 90 (48.9%) were still taking the therapy at 
the time of discharge from hospital. A documented indication for ongoing therapy 
was present in only nine patients (10%). We assumed a 10-year life expectancy 
after ICU discharge and that most patients continued taking a PPI, and 
calculated an additional cost of $180.20 per patient admitted to the ICU. This 
was based only on unnecessary PPI costs (ignoring costs of managing additional 
adverse events). The direct cumulative annual cost to the WA health system of 
PPIs continued unnecessarily for patients at discharge from hospital is 
estimated to be $250 800 for each year they continue to receive them.
CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of patients prescribed SUP in the ICU 
continue receiving this therapy at hospital discharge despite no clear 
indication. In addition to potential adverse clinical effects, this is 
associated with major direct and indirect cost implications.

BACKGROUND: Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is rare inflammatory disease of 
unknown etiology that usually affects young adults. The more common clinical 
manifestations are spiking fevers, arthritis, evanescent rash, elevated liver 
enzymes, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and serositis. The multi-visceral 
involvement of the disease and the different complications, such as macrophage 
activation syndrome, may strongly decrease the life expectancy of AOSD patients.
METHODS: This study aimed to identify the positive and negative features 
correlated with the outcome of patients. A retrospective analysis of AOSD 
patients prospectively admitted to three rheumatologic centers was performed to 
identify the clinical features present at the time of diagnosis and to predict 
the possible outcome. Furthermore, we investigated the as yet to be validated 
prognostic value of the systemic score previously proposed.
RESULTS: One hundred consecutive AOSD patients were enrolled. The mean systemic 
score showed that the majority of patients had a multi-organ involvement. 
Sixteen patients showed different complications, mainly the macrophage 
activation syndrome. A strong increase of inflammatory markers was observed. All 
patients received steroids at different dosages, 55 patients in association with 
immunosuppressive drugs and 32 in association with biologic agents. Sixteen 
patients died during the follow-up. Regression analysis showed that the higher 
values of the systemic score and the presence of AOSD-related complications, 
assessed at the time of diagnosis, were significantly correlated with patient 
mortality. A prognostic impact of the systemic score of ≥ 7.0 was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that a higher systemic score and the presence of 
AOSD-related complications at the time of diagnosis were significantly 
associated with mortality. Of note, a cut-off at 7.0 of the systemic score 
showed a strong prognostic impact in identifying patients at risk of 
AOSD-related death.

Mitophagy is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial quality control. 
Mitochondrial division is believed to occur first, and autophagosome formation 
subsequently occurs to enwrap mitochondria as a process of mitophagy. However, 
there has not been any temporal analysis of mitochondrial division and 
autophagosome formation in mitophagy. Therefore, the relationships among these 
processes remain unclear. We show that the mitochondrial division factor Dnm1 in 
yeast or Drp1 in mammalian cells is dispensable for mitophagy. Autophagosome 
formation factors, such as FIP200, ATG14, and WIPIs, were essential for the 
mitochondrial division for mitophagy. Live-cell imaging showed that isolation 
membranes formed on the mitochondria. A small portion of the mitochondria then 
divided from parental mitochondria simultaneously with the extension of 
isolation membranes and autophagosome formation. These findings suggest the 
presence of a mitophagy process in which mitochondrial division for mitophagy is 
accomplished together with autophagosome formation.

The Fontan operation is performed as a palliative procedure to improve survival 
in infants born with a functionally univentricular circulation. The success of 
the operation is demonstrated by a growing adult Fontan population that exists 
with this unique physiology. Late follow-up has demonstrated expected and 
unexpected sequelae, and has shown multisystem effects of this circulation. This 
review discusses the challenges of managing the late complications in terms of 
understanding this unique physiology and the innovative therapeutic 
interventions that are being investigated. The challenge remains to maintain 
quality of life for adult survivors, as well as extending life expectancy.

PURPOSE: Recently, the number of elderly patients has increased due to a longer 
life expectancy. Among these elderly patients, more octogenarians will be 
diagnosed with major hepatobiliary pancreatic (HBP) diseases. Therefore, we need 
to evaluate the safety and risk factors of major HBP surgery in patients older 
than 80 years.
METHODS: From January 2000 to April 2015, patients who underwent major HBP 
surgery were identified. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to 
their age at the time of surgery: Group O (≥80 years) and group Y (<80 years). 
The patient characteristics and intra- and postoperative outcomes were 
retrospectively investigated in the 2 groups.
RESULTS: The median age was 84 years (range, 80-95 years) in group O and 61 
years (range, 27-79 years) in group Y. group O had worse American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status (ASA ≥ III: 23% vs. 7%, P = 0.002) and 
was associated with a higher rate of hypertension and heart problems as 
comorbidities. There were significant differences in albumin and BUN, favoring 
group Y. The length of intensive care unit stay was longer in group O, whereas 
the overall complication and mortality rates did not show statistical 
difference. But, there was a significant difference in systemic complication of 
both Clavien-Dindo classification grade ≥II and ≥III as complications were 
divided into surgical site complication and systemic complication.
CONCLUSION: Major HBP surgery can be performed safely in patients older than 80 
years if postoperative management is appropriately provided.

Surgery in metastatic bone disease is currently the most frequent type of 
surgery in orthopedic oncology. Improved survival rates and an increasing 
incidence of bone metastasis have led to an increase in complications caused by 
metastatic disease, such as pathological fractures or hardware failure after 
operative treatment. Although surgery of metastatic lesions remains a palliative 
therapy concept, because of sufficient therapy for the primary carcinomas, 
tumor-specific-oriented follow-up protocols and a variation in the prognosis for 
the individual entities, an individually adapted treatment strategy is 
necessary. Depending on the life expectancy, more aggressive surgical procedures 
with the goal of adequate local tumor control have come into focus. Therefore, 
prognosis-tailored treatment requires an experienced team and should be 
performed in a multidisciplinary tumor center. The current article provides an 
overview of recent therapy concepts for the surgical treatment including 
endoprosthetic reconstruction, internal fixation with either intramedullary 
nailing or plate fixation devices, often augmented with bone cement.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is first-line treatment for 
uncomplicated gallstone disease in high-income countries due to benefits such as 
shorter hospital stays, reduced morbidity, more rapid return to work, and lower 
mortality as well-being considered cost-effective. However, there persists a 
lack of uptake in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, there is a need to 
evaluate laparoscopic cholecystectomy in comparison with an open approach in 
these settings.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate laparoscopic 
and open cholecystectomies at Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH), a tertiary care 
referral hospital in Rwanda. Sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed 
to determine the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy costs and effectiveness 
values were $2664.47 with 0.87 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $2058.72 
with 0.75 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
laparoscopic over open cholecystectomy was $4946.18. Results are sensitive to 
the initial laparoscopic equipment investment and number of cases performed 
annually but robust to other parameters. The laparoscopic intervention is more 
cost-effective with investment costs less than $91,979, greater than 65 cases 
annually, or at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds greater than $3975/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: At RMH, while laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be a more effective 
approach, it is also more expensive given the low caseload and high investment 
costs. At commonly accepted WTP thresholds, it is not cost-effective. However, 
as investment costs decrease and/or case volume increases, the laparoscopic 
approach may become favorable. Countries and hospitals should aspire to develop 
innovative, low-cost options in high volume to combat these barriers and provide 
laparoscopic surgery.

BACKGROUND: Health economic analyses based on randomized trials have shown that 
screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) cost-effectively decreases 
AAA-related, as well as all- cause mortality. However, follow-up from 
implemented screening programmes now reveal substantially changed conditions in 
terms of prevalence, attendance rate, costs and mortality after intervention. 
Our aim was to evaluate whether screening for AAA among 65-year-old men is 
cost-effective based on contemporary data on prevalence and attendance rates 
from an ongoing AAA screening programme.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model, previously used to analyse the 
cost-effectiveness of an AAA screening programme prior to implementation in 
clinical practice, was updated using data collected from an implemented 
screening programme as well as data from contemporary published data and the 
Swedish register for vascular surgery (Swedvasc).
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that the cost per life-year gained and 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were €4832 and €6325, respectively. 
Based on conventional threshold values of cost-effectiveness, the probability of 
screening being cost-effective was high.
CONCLUSION: Despite the reduction of AAA-prevalence and changes in 
AAA-management over time, screening 65-year-old men for AAA still appears to 
yield health outcomes at a cost below conventional thresholds of 
cost-effectiveness.

The aim of the project reported here was to investigate whether publications of 
RCTs on patients with advanced cancer take into account aspects of the end of 
life, the corresponding terminology and the relevance of palliative care needs 
of these patients. Based on the publications of treatment studies, the specific 
aims were to investigate if: the phase of the disease (progressive terminal 
disease) was specified correctly (subgoal 1); the superior patient-relevant 
treatment goal (prolongation of life expectancy, improvement of quality of 
life/best possible maintenance of quality of life or symptom control) was 
specifically named (the superior treatment goal must not be confused with the 
study outcomes, but describes the overall goal for the patient that the 
intervention is clinically intended or hoped to achieve, subgoal 2); 
patient-relevant outcomes (outcomes on overall survival and/or patient-reported 
outcomes [PROs]) were assessed under particular consideration of the superior 
treatment goals identified in subgoal 2 (subgoal 3); terms such as curation, 
palliation, palliative medicine/palliative care, best supportive care, 
supportive therapy and palliative therapy were used and how they were defined 
(subgoal 4); a critical reflection of the benefit-harm profile was conducted 
(subgoal 5).

More than 30 million people are infected with HIV, and HIV remains the fifth 
leading cause of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. Antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) dramatically decreases mortality rate, but there are side effects, 
long-term toxicities, expenses, stigmas, and inconveniences associated with 
chronic treatment, and HIV-infected individuals on ART have an increased risk of 
malignancies, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, and shortened life 
expectancy. Therefore, a cure for HIV remains an important goal. Combining new 
cell and gene therapy technology is an exciting approach that appears promising 
in vitro. Animal testing and careful clinical trials will be needed to determine 
if these strategies are clinically useful.

BACKGROUND: A decrease in mortality across all ages causes a shift of the age 
pattern of mortality, or mortality delay, while differences in the rate of 
decrease across ages cause a change in the shape of the age-at-death 
distribution, mortality compression or expansion. Evidence exists for both 
compression and delay of mortality. Existing parametric models to describe the 
full age pattern of mortality are not able to capture mortality delay versus 
mortality compression. More recent models that assess delay versus compression 
mostly focused on the adult or old ages alone and did not distinguish mortality 
compression below and above the modal age at death, although they represent 
different mechanisms.
METHODS: This paper presents a new parametric model that describes the full age 
pattern of mortality and assesses compression - at different stages of life - 
and delay of mortality: the CoDe model. The model includes 10 parameters, of 
which five are constant over time. The five time-varying parameters reflect 
delay of mortality and compression of mortality in infancy, adolescence, young 
adulthood, late adulthood, and old age. The model describes infant and 
background mortality by two simple functions, uses a mixed logistic model with 
different slopes in adult, middle, and old age, and includes the modal age at 
death as a parameter to account for the delay in mortality.
RESULTS: Applying the CoDe model to age-specific probabilities of death for 
Japanese, French, American, and Danish men and women between 1950 and 2010 
showed a very good fit of the full age pattern of mortality. Delay of mortality 
explained about two-thirds of the increase in life expectancy at birth, whereas 
compression of mortality due to mortality declines in young age explained about 
one-third. No strong compression of mortality in late adulthood age was 
observed. Mortality compression in old age has had a small negative impact on 
life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The CoDe model proved a valid instrument for describing the full 
age pattern of mortality and for disentangling the effects of mortality delay 
and compression - at different stages of life - on the increase in life 
expectancy.

The availability of oral direct-acting antivirals has altered the hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) treatment paradigm for both pre-liver transplant (LT) and post-LT 
patients. There is a perceived trade-off between pre-LT versus post-LT treatment 
of HCV-treatment may improve liver function but potentially decrease the 
likelihood of a necessary LT. Our objective was to identify LT-eligible patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis who would benefit (and not benefit) from pre-LT 
treatment based on their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. We 
simulated a virtual trial comparing long-term outcomes of pre-LT versus post-LT 
HCV treatment with oral direct-acting antivirals for patients with MELD scores 
between 10 and 40. We developed a Markov-based microsimulation model, which 
simulated the life course of patients on the transplant waiting list and after 
LT. Simulation of LT integrated data from recent trials of oral direct-acting 
antivirals (SOLAR 1 and 2), the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and 
other studies. The outcomes of the model included life expectancy, 1-year and 
5-year patient survival, and mortality. Model-predicted patient survival was 
validated with UNOS data. We found that, at the national level, treating HCV 
before LT increased life expectancy if MELD was ≤27 but could decrease life 
expectancy at higher MELD scores. Depending on the UNOS region, the threshold 
MELD score to treat HCV pre-LT varied between 23 and 27 and was lower for UNOS 
regions 3, 10, and 11 and higher for regions 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Sensitivity 
analysis showed that the thresholds were stable.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the optimal MELD threshold below which 
decompensated cirrhosis patients should receive HCV treatment while awaiting LT 
is between 23 and 27, depending on the UNOS region. (Hepatology

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune liver 
disease that mainly affects middle-aged women. Obeticholic acid (OCA), which was 
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for PBC treatment, has 
demonstrated positive effects on biochemical markers of liver function. Our 
objective was to evaluate the long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness 
of OCA as a second-line treatment for PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic 
acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA. We developed a 
mathematical model to simulate the lifetime course of PBC patients treated with 
OCA+UDCA versus UDCA alone. Efficacy data were derived from the phase 3 PBC OCA 
International Study of Efficacy trial, and the natural history of PBC was 
informed by published clinical studies. Model outcomes were validated using the 
PBC Global Study. We found that in comparison with UDCA, OCA+UDCA could decrease 
the 15-year cumulative incidences of decompensated cirrhosis from 12.2% to 4.5%, 
hepatocellular carcinoma from 9.1% to 4.0%, liver transplants from 4.5% to 1.2%, 
and liver-related deaths from 16.2% to 5.7% and increase 15-year transplant-free 
survival from 61.1% to 72.9%. The lifetime cost of PBC treatment would increase 
from $63,000 to $902,000 (1,330% increment). The discounted quality-adjusted 
life years with UDCA and OCA+UDCA were 10.74 and 11.78, respectively, and the 
corresponding costs were $142,300 and $633,900, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $473,400/quality-adjusted life year gained. The 
results were most sensitive to the cost of OCA.
CONCLUSION: OCA is a promising new therapy to substantially improve the 
long-term outcomes of PBC patients, but at its current annual price of $69,350, 
it is not cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year; pricing below $18,450/year is needed to 
make OCA cost-effective. (Hepatology 2017;65:920-928).

United States Life Tables, 2012.

Arias E, Heron M, Xu J.

Objectives-This report presents complete period life tables for the United 
States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on agespecific death rates in 
2012. Methods-Data used to prepare the 2012 life tables are 2012 final mortality 
statistics; July 1, 2012, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial 
census; and 2012 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to 
estimate the 2012 life tables was first implemented with data year 2008. The 
methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains 
unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic 
origin for data year 2006. Results-In 2012, the overall expectation of life at 
birth was 78.8 years, increasing from 78.7 years in 2011. From 2011 to 2012, 
life expectancy at birth increased for both males (from 76.3 to 76.4) and 
females (81.1 to 81.2), for the white population (79.0 to 79.1), the black 
population (75.3 to 75.5), the Hispanic population (81.8 to 81.9), the 
non-Hispanic white population (78.7 to 78.9), and the non- Hispanic black 
population (75.0 to 75.1).

Individual dose estimates calculated by Dosimetry System 2002 (DS02) for the 
Life Span Study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors are based on input data that 
specify location and shielding at the time of the bombing (ATB). A multi-year 
effort to improve information on survivors' locations ATB has recently been 
completed, along with comprehensive improvements in their terrain shielding 
input data and several improvements to computational algorithms used in 
combination with DS02 at RERF. Improvements began with a thorough review and 
prioritization of original questionnaire data on location and shielding that 
were taken from survivors or their proxies in the period 1949-1963. Related 
source documents varied in level of detail, from relatively simple lists to 
carefully-constructed technical drawings of structural and other shielding and 
surrounding neighborhoods. Systematic errors were reduced in this work by 
restoring the original precision of map coordinates that had been truncated due 
to limitations in early data processing equipment and by correcting distortions 
in the old (WWII-era) maps originally used to specify survivors' positions, 
among other improvements. Distortion errors were corrected by aligning the old 
maps and neighborhood drawings to orthophotographic mosaics of the cities that 
were newly constructed from pre-bombing aerial photographs. Random errors that 
were reduced included simple transcription errors and mistakes in identifying 
survivors' locations on the old maps. Terrain shielding input data that had been 
originally estimated for limited groups of survivors using older methods and 
data sources were completely re-estimated for all survivors using new digital 
terrain elevation data. Improvements to algorithms included a fix to an error in 
the DS02 code for coupling house and terrain shielding, a correction for 
elevation at the survivor's location in calculating angles to the horizon used 
for terrain shielding input, an improved method for truncating high dose 
estimates to 4 Gy to reduce the effect of dose error, and improved methods for 
calculating averaged shielding transmission factors that are used to calculate 
doses for survivors without detailed shielding input data. Input data changes 
are summarized and described here in some detail, along with the resulting 
changes in dose estimates and a simple description of changes in risk estimates 
for solid cancer mortality. This and future RERF publications will refer to the 
new dose estimates described herein as "DS02R1 doses."

STUDY QUESTION: What is the cost-effectiveness of elective single embryo 
transfer (eSET) versus double embryo transfer (DET) strategies from a societal 
perspective, when applying a time horizon of 1, 5 and 18 years?
SUMMARY ANSWER: From a short-term perspective (1 year) it is cost-effective to 
replace DET with single embryo transfer; however when intermediate- (5 years) 
and long-term (18 years) costs and consequences are incorporated, DET becomes 
the most cost-effective strategy, given a ceiling ratio of €20 000 per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: According to previous cost-effectiveness research into 
embryo transfer strategies, DET is considered cost-effective if society is 
willing to pay around €20 000 for an extra live birth. However, interpretation 
of those studies is complicated, as those studies fail to incorporate long-term 
costs and outcomes and used live birth as a measure of effectiveness instead of 
QALYs. With this outcome, both multiple and singletons were valued as one live 
birth, whereas costs of all children of a multiple were incorporated.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A Markov model (cycle length: 1 year; time 
horizon: 1, 5 and 18 years) was developed comparing a maximum of: (i) three 
cycles of eSET in all patients; (ii) four cycles of eSET in all patients; (iii) 
five cycles of eSET in all patients; (iv) three cycles of standard treatment 
policy (STP), i.e. eSET in women <38 years with a good quality embryo, and DET 
in all other women; and (v) three cycles of DET in all patients.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Expected life years (LYs), child QALYs 
and costs were estimated for all comparators. Input parameters were derived from 
a retrospective cohort study, in which hospital resource data were collected 
(n=580) and a parental questionnaire was sent out (431 respondents). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (5000 iterations) was performed.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: With a time horizon of 18 years, DETx3 is 
most effective (0.54 live births, 10.2 LYs and 9.8 QALYs) and expensive (€37 
871) per couple starting IVF. Three cycles of eSET are least effective (0.43 
live births, 7.1 LYs and 6.8 QALYs) and expensive (€25 563). We assumed that 
society is willing to pay €20 000 per QALY gained. With a time horizon of 1 
year, eSETx3 was the most cost-effective embryo transfer strategy with a 
probability of being cost-effective of 99.9%. With a time horizon of 5 or 18 
years, DETx3 was most cost-effective, with probabilities of being cost-effective 
of 77.3 and 93.2%, respectively.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is the first study to use QALYs generated 
by the children in the economic evaluation of embryo transfer strategies. There 
remains some disagreement on whether QALYs generated by new life should be used 
in economic evaluations of fertility treatment. A further limitation is that 
treatment ends when it results in live birth and that only child QALYs were 
considered as measure of effectiveness. The results for the time horizon of 18 
years might be less solid, as the data beyond the age of 8 years are based on 
extrapolation.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The current Markov model indicates that when 
child QALYs are used as measure of outcome it is not cost-effective on the long 
term to replace DET with single embryo transfer strategies. However, for a 
balanced approach, a family-planning perspective would be preferable, including 
additional treatment cycles for couples who wish to have another child. 
Furthermore, the analysis should be extended to include QALYs of family members.

Meta-analyses of randomized trials using individual-participant data, which 
represent the highest level of evidence for the evaluation of a treatment 
effect, are now used in different contexts in clinical research. This article 
aims at reviewing some of these new applications. Meta-analyses are increasingly 
used in economic evaluation, which implies new measure outcomes of the treatment 
effect, as well as in biomarkers evaluations thanks to their higher statistical 
power and the possibility to validate findings on independent data. This article 
also considers the perspectives opened up by new data sources, such as 
randomized trials registers, and data sharing policies.

AIMS: A trial-based comparison of the use of resources, costs and quality of 
life outcomes of arthroscopic and open surgical management for rotator cuff 
tears in the United Kingdom NHS was performed using data from the United Kingdom 
Rotator Cuff Study (UKUFF) randomised controlled trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from 273 patients, healthcare-related use of 
resources, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated at 12 
months and 24 months after surgery on an intention-to-treat basis with 
adjustment for covariates. Uncertainty about the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for arthroscopic versus open management at 24 months of follow-up was 
incorporated using bootstrapping. Multiple imputation methods were used to deal 
with missing data.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the arthroscopic and open 
groups in terms of total mean use and cost of resources or QALYs at any time 
post-operatively. Open management dominated arthroscopic management in 59.8% of 
bootstrapped cost and effect differences. The probability that arthroscopic 
management was cost-effective compared with open management at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained was 20.9%.
CONCLUSION: There was no significant overall difference in the use or cost of 
resources or quality of life between arthroscopic and open management in the 
trial. There was uncertainty about which strategy was most cost-effective. Cite
