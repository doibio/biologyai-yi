p=0.00). On the other hand, the increase of the standardized disability-adjusted 
life year rate was related to musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, kidney 
disorders and substance use disorders with a significant annual percentage 
change of 0.1%, 0.2% and 1.3% (p=0.00) respectively. Conclusion: the 
implementation of the national strategy is the key solution to mitigate the 
impact of non-communicable diseases in Tunisia.

A lack of social relations appears to impact on health and life expectancy among 
the older persons. The quality and diversity of social relations are correlated 
with good health and well-being in later life. Chronic pain is a crucial issue 
in aging population. Effective communication between the older persons with 
chronic pain, their relatives and the actors of the healthcare system 
facilitates the management of this condition. Studies on communication in later 
life generally do not consider the older persons' social network as a whole, 
focusing only a specific segment (e.g., family or medical staff). This lack of 
scientific data prevents the actors of the healthcare system from offering 
solutions to bridge clinically relevant communication gaps. As a consequence, 
our study has three objectives: (1) to identify how the older persons perceive 
communication about chronic pain with their social network; (2) to identify 
their unmet communication needs; (3) to develop recommendations that improve 
communication about chronic pain in later life. The study will be divided into 
two phases. The first phase will meet objectives 1 and 2. It will involve 
individual interviews with about 50 people over 75 years old suffering from 
chronic pain and without major cognitive or auditory troubles. In this phase, we 
will apply a multi-layered analysis. We will map the older persons' personal 
network and identify their communication practices and needs, by combining 
content and discourse analysis with social network theories. The second phase of 
the study will aim at recommendations based on the results of the first phase 
(objective 3). It will require focus groups with different sets of stakeholders 
(older persons, relative caregivers, health professionals, decision-makers). In 
the second phase, we will use content analysis to pinpoint the concerns and 
suggestions for action. The results will be disseminated on three levels: (1) to 
the scientific world (specialists in the field of health and aging and health 
communication); (2) to health practitioners working with older persons; (3) to 
society at large, with a focus on institutions and groups directly concerned by 
the issue.

What is the relationship between mortality and satellite images as elucidated 
through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks? Background: Following a 
century of increase, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated and 
begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite images and street view 
images, prior work has demonstrated associations of the built environment with 
income, education, access to care, and health factors such as obesity. However, 
assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude 
mortality rate across the United States has been lacking. Objective: We sought 
to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted 
from satellite images. Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding 
schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming 
interface for 430 counties representing ~68.9% of the US population. A 
convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each 
county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted 
using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to 
mortality and its associated covariate predictors. Results: Predicted mortality 
from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated 
to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of 
mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. 
counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, 
and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were 
clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, 
income, geographical region, race, and age. Conclusions: The application of deep 
learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can 
serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we 
identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, 
future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with 
health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health 
interventions.

The impact of an unequal distribution of education on inequalities in life 
expectancy.

Prior research has found socio-economic determinants such as education to affect 
health outcomes. Yet, education is not distributed equally among the population. 
This article attempts to quantify the impact of unequal distribution of 
education on inequalities in life expectancy. We calculate a Gini coefficient of 
longevity from the life tables provided by the Human Mortality Database and a 
Gini coefficient of education using data on educational attainment from Barro 
and Lee (2013). We estimate linear regression models to examine the relationship 
between inequality in education and inequality in life expectancy at the country 
level for up to 31 European countries between 1970 and 2010. Results provide 
empirical evidence for a statistically significant positive association between 
educational inequality and inequalities of longevity. Confounding factors 
reflecting individual health behaviour such as cigarette or alcohol consumption 
do not exert a separate statistically significant effect on inequality in life 
expectancy. Findings are robust to alternative calculation of key variables, 
dropping a potential outlier, and an alternative estimation approach. These 
findings suggest that not only education, but also equality in education is a 
crucial factor for health outcomes. Continuing efforts should be directed 
towards the reduction of educational inequality in order to reduce inequality in 
longevity within a country.

INTRODUCTION: Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is rare in elderly patients. 
As the population ages and life expectancy increases, the frequency of this 
injury will increase, while the treatment and outcomes remain unclear.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the collected data of patients >60 years 
old with BTAI to investigate the mechanism of trauma; time interval from injury 
to diagnosis; type and timing of surgical intervention; aortic arch pattern; 
choice of left subclavian artery reconstruction; endograft to treat BTAI; length 
of the endovascular procedure; endoleaks; complications including stroke, 
paraplegia, and renal failure; length of hospital stay (LOS) and intensive care 
unit stay (L.ICUS); and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Five elderly trauma patients were found to have BTAI. Four (80%) were 
males, the cohort mean age was 68 years, the major mechanism of trauma was fall 
injury, and the associated injury was thoracic trauma. All patients were 
transferred to our hospital, and emergency computed tomography angiography 
showed BTAI in each patient. The average time interval from injury to diagnosis 
was 2.7 days. Two patients suddenly showed signs of instability in their vital 
signs and underwent immediate endovascular repair, while 3 patients underwent 
delayed endovascular repair. The injury site was located in the aortic isthmus 
just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery; the aortic arch pattern 
was II (80.0%) in 4 cases and III in 1 case (20.0%). The choice of left 
subclavian artery reconstruction included chimney, double chimney, 
prefenestration, and chimney combined with in situ fenestration. Endografts to 
treat BTAI included the Ankura (Lifetech Scientific, Shenzhen, China) and the 
C-TAG (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ USA).The length of the endovascular 
procedure was 75.4 min; there were no endoleaks and no complications including 
stroke, paraplegia, or renal failure. The average LOS was 25 days, and the 
average L.ICUS of 2 patients was 15 days, with no 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with fall injury should promptly exclude BTAI. 
Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a left subclavian artery 
reconstruction technique provided good results without procedure-related or 
neurological complications. Because of the low incidence of this type of injury, 
we are unable to provide any evidence to guide the treatment option for this 
life-threatening condition.

OBJECTIVES: We provide a brief introduction to the objectives, data, methods and 
results of the World Health Organization (WHO)/International Labor Organization 
(ILO) Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury (WHO/ILO 
Joint Estimates), which estimated the burden attributable to 19 selected 
occupational risk factors.
METHODS: The WHO/ILO Joint Estimates were produced within the global Comparative 
Risk Assessment framework, which attributes the burden of one specific health 
outcome (ie, disease/injury) to a specific occupational risk factor. For 39 
established occupational risk factor-health outcome pairs, estimates are 
produced using population attributable fractions (PAF) from recent burden of 
disease estimates. For two additional pairs, PAF are calculated from new 
databases of exposure and risk ratios produced in WHO/ILO systematic reviews. 
Attributable disease burdens were estimated by applying the PAF to total disease 
burdens.
RESULTS: Globally in 2016, it is estimated that 1.88 [95% uncertainty range (UR) 
1.84-1.92] million deaths and 89.72 (95% UR 88.61-90.83) million 
disability-adjusted life years were attributable to the 19 selected occupational 
risk factors and their health outcomes. A disproportionately large work-related 
burden of disease is observed in the WHO African Region (for disability-adjusted 
life years), South-East Asia Region, and Western Pacific Region (for deaths), 
males and older age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The WHO/ILO Joint Estimates can be used for global monitoring of 
exposure to occupational risk factors and work-related burden of disease and to 
identify, plan, cost, implement and evaluate policies, programs and actions to 
prevent exposure to occupational risk factors and their associated burden.

AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of professional-mode flash glucose 
monitoring in adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice compared with 
usual clinical care.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted as a component of the GP-OSMOTIC 
trial, a pragmatic multicentre 12-month randomised controlled trial enrolling 
299 adults with type 2 diabetes in Victoria, Australia. The economic evaluation 
was conducted from an Australian healthcare sector perspective with a lifetime 
horizon. Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) and total healthcare costs were 
compared between the intervention and the usual care group within the trial 
period. The 'UKPDS Outcomes Model 2' was used to simulate post-trial lifetime 
costs, life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: No significant difference in health-related quality of life and costs 
was found between the two groups within the trial period. Professional-mode 
flash glucose monitoring yielded greater QALYs (0.03 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.04]) and a 
higher cost (A$3807 [95% CI: 3604, 4007]) compared with usual clinical care 
using a lifetime horizon under the trial-based monitoring frequency, considered 
not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = A$120,228). The 
intervention becomes cost-effective if sensor price is reduced to lower than 
50%, or monitoring frequency is decreased to once per year while maintaining the 
same treatment effect on HbA1c .
CONCLUSIONS: Including professional-mode flash glucose monitoring every 3 months 
as part of a management plan for people with type 2 diabetes in general practice 
is not cost-effective, but could be if the sensor price or monitoring frequency 
can be reduced.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is the 10th most common cause of frailty in 
young individuals and has triggered morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients 
with BD have a life expectancy 9 to 17 years lower than that of normal people. 
BD is a predominant mental disorder, but it can be misdiagnosed as depressive 
disorder, which leads to difficulties in treating affected patients. 
Approximately 60% of patients with BD are treated for depression. However, 
machine learning provides advanced skills and techniques for better diagnosis of 
BD.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to explore the machine learning algorithms used for 
the detection and diagnosis of bipolar disorder and its subtypes.
METHODS: The study protocol adopted the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) 
guidelines. We explored 3 databases, namely Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and 
PubMed. To enhance the search, we performed backward screening of all the 
references of the included studies. Based on the predefined selection criteria, 
2 levels of screening were performed: title and abstract review, and full review 
of the articles that met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed 
independently by all investigators. To synthesize the extracted data, a 
narrative synthesis approach was followed.
RESULTS: We retrieved 573 potential articles were from the 3 databases. After 
preprocessing and screening, only 33 articles that met our inclusion criteria 
were identified. The most commonly used data belonged to the clinical category 
(19, 58%). We identified different machine learning models used in the selected 
studies, including classification models (18, 55%), regression models (5, 16%), 
model-based clustering methods (2, 6%), natural language processing (1, 3%), 
clustering algorithms (1, 3%), and deep learning-based models (3, 9%). Magnetic 
resonance imaging data were most commonly used for classifying bipolar patients 
compared to other groups (11, 34%), whereas microarray expression data sets and 
genomic data were the least commonly used. The maximum ratio of accuracy was 
98%, whereas the minimum accuracy range was 64%.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review provides an overview of recent studies based on 
machine learning models used to diagnose patients with BD regardless of their 
demographics or if they were compared to patients with psychiatric diagnoses. 
Further research can be conducted to provide clinical decision support in the 
health industry.

Pain is a significant problem worldwide that affects the quality of life of 
patients. Dezocine is a non-addictive analgesic drug with kappa-opioid 
antagonist activity and has been successfully used to alleviate of postoperative 
pain. In addition, dezocine has an analgesic effect similar to that of morphine, 
alleviating moderate to severe pain. Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 
(RAPGEF3) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for GTPases Rap1 and Rap2, 
which could enhance the activity of Rap1 to promote cell adhesion and axon 
regeneration, as well as promote neurite extension by interacting with nerve 
growth factors. Here, we first observed that overexpression of RAPGEF3 increased 
cell viability, as shown by a CCK-8 assay, and recovered brain function in rats. 
The expression of inflammation-related factors at the mRNA level was detected 
using qPCR, and the concentration of these factors in a cultured cell medium and 
rat serum samples were decreased as shown by ELISA after RAPGEF3 overexpression. 
Through western blotting, we further found that pro-inflammatory proteins were 
decreased, and these effects might be mediated by inhibition of the Ras/p-38 
MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, we speculated that RAPGEF3overexpression 
enhances the therapeutic effect of dezocine on neuropathic pain by inhibiting 
the inflammatory response through inhibition of the Ras/p-38 MAPK signaling 
pathway.

Time to Benefit of Bisphosphonate Therapy for the Prevention of Fractures Among 
Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical 
Trials.

IMPORTANCE: The clinical decision to initiate bisphosphonate therapy for the 
treatment of osteoporosis requires balancing shorter-term harms and burdens (eg, 
gastroesophageal irritation or severe musculoskeletal pain) with longer-term 
benefits in reducing potential fractures.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the time to benefit (TTB) of bisphosphonate therapy for the 
prevention of nonvertebral and other fractures among postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis.
DATA SOURCES: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified from systematic 
reviews commissioned by the US Preventive Services Task Force (1 review), the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1 review), the Cochrane Library (2 
reviews), and the Endocrine Society (1 review).
STUDY SELECTION: Studies selected were RCTs involving postmenopausal women with 
a diagnosis of osteoporosis based on existing vertebral fractures or bone 
mineral density T scores of -2.5 or lower. The selection process was focused on 
studies of alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid because they are 
guideline-recommended first-line agents for reducing nonvertebral fractures. 
Studies were excluded if they did not focus on women with a primary diagnosis of 
osteoporosis, had no placebo arm, or had a lack of data on time to fracture.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Random-effects Weibull survival curves were 
fitted and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the absolute 
risk reduction (ARR) and TTB for each study. These estimates were pooled using a 
random-effects meta-analysis model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the time to 3 different ARR 
thresholds (0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for the first nonvertebral fracture. 
Secondary outcomes included the time to 4 ARR thresholds (0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 
and 0.010) for hip fracture, any clinical fracture, and clinical vertebral 
fracture.
RESULTS: Of 67 full-text articles identified, 10 RCTs comprising 23 384 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were included either as the original RCT 
or part of subsequently published pooled analyses. Among the studies, the number 
of participants ranged from 994 to 7765, with mean (SD) age ranging from 63 (7) 
years to 74 (3) years and follow-up duration ranging from 12 to 48 months. The 
pooled meta-analysis found that 12.4 months (95% CI, 6.3-18.4 months) were 
needed to avoid 1 nonvertebral fracture per 100 postmenopausal women receiving 
bisphosphonate therapy at an ARR of 0.010. To prevent 1 hip fracture, 200 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis would need to receive bisphosphonate 
therapy for 20.3 months (95% CI, 11.0-29.7 months) at an ARR of 0.005. In 
addition, 200 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis would need to receive 
bisphosphonate therapy for 12.1 months (95% CI, 6.4-17.8 months) to avoid 1 
clinical vertebral fracture at an ARR of 0.005.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis found that the TTB of 
bisphosphonate therapy was 12.4 months to prevent 1 nonvertebral fracture per 
100 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. These results suggest that 
bisphosphonate therapy is most likely to benefit postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis who have a life expectancy greater than 12.4 months.

INTRODUCTION: Baricitinib-remdesivir (BARI-REM) combination is superior to 
remdesivir (REM) in reducing recovery time and accelerating clinical improvement 
among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
specifically those receiving high-flow oxygen/noninvasive ventilation. Here we 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of BARI-REM versus REM in hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19 in the USA.
METHODS: A three-state model was developed addressing costs and patient utility 
associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, immediate post hospital care, and 
subsequent lifetime medical care. Analysis was performed from the perspective of 
a payer and a hospital. Both perspectives evaluated two subgroups: all patients 
and patients who required oxygen. The primary measures of benefit in the model 
were patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued during and after 
hospitalization, cost per life years gained, cost per death avoided, and cost 
per use of mechanical ventilation avoided.
RESULTS: In the base-case payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, treatment 
with BARI-REM versus REM resulted in an incremental total cost of $7962, a gain 
of 0.446 life years and gain of 0.3565 QALYs over REM. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of using BARI-REM were estimated as $22,334 per QALY 
and $17,858 per life year. The base-case and sensitivity analyses showed that 
the total incremental cost per QALY falls within the reduced willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000/QALY applied under health emergencies. In all hospitalized 
patients, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM reduced total hospital expenditures 
per patient by $1778 and total reimbursement payments by $1526, resulting in a 
$252 reduction in net costs per patient; it also resulted in a net gain of 
0.0018 QALYs and increased survival of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 2.7%.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that BARI-REM is cost-effective compared to using 
REM for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The base-case results of this 
cost-effectiveness model were most sensitive to average annual medical costs for 
recovered patients.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a worldwide disease, and also the main cause of 
pain and disability in the motor system. Due to the aging population in China, 
extension of life expectancy and increased number of obese people, the number of 
people affected by KOA continues to surge. Neither surgical nor non-surgical 
treatment can change the disease process, but these interventions can reduce 
pain and disability. The treatment principle of KOA is to start with 
non-surgical treatment, which has been considered as the first choice for KOA 
patients due to its advantages of less complications, minimal invasiveness, and 
low medical cost. This article describes the non-surgical treatment of KOA, 
aiming to provide new insights into the clinical treatment of KOA.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the economic burden expressed in costs and quality of 
life of the post-surgical treatment of peri‑ and/or intra-articular fractures in 
the lower extremity from a societal perspective.
DESIGN: This is a quantitative study as it aims to find averages and generalize 
results to wider populations. The design is a cost-of-illness and quality of 
life study focusing on costs (in euros), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and 
Quality of Life (Qol) in patients with peri‑ and/or intra-articular fractures of 
the lower extremities.
SETTING: Surgically treated trauma patients with peri‑ and/or intra-articular 
fractures of the lower extremities during 26 weeks follow-up. Patients were 
included from 4 hospitals in the Netherlands.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, ADL and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY).
METHODS: Cost of illness was estimated through a bottom-up method. The Dutch 
Eq-5D-5 L questionnaire was used to calculate utilities while Lower Extremity 
Functional Scale (LEFS) scores were used as a measure of ADL. Non-parametric 
bootstrapping was used to test for statistical differences in costs. Subgroup 
analyses were performed to determine the influence of work status and further 
sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Total average societal costs were € 9836.96 over six months. 
Unexpectedly, total societal and healthcare costs were lower for patients with a 
paid job relative to patients without. Sensitivity analyses showed that our 
choice of a societal perspective and the EuroQol as our primary utility 
measurement tool had a significant effect on the outcomes. The ADL at baseline 
was respectively; 10.4 and at 26 weeks post-surgery treatment 49.5. The QoL was 
at baseline respectively; 0.3 and at 26 weeks post-surgery treatment 0.7. These 
findings are indicative of a significantly improved ADL and QoL (p ≤ 0.05) over 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveal a substantial economic burden in monetary terms 
and effect on QoL of patients with peri‑ and/or intra-articular fractures of the 
lower extremities during 26 weeks follow-up.
REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NTR6077).

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumour, 
with the least favourable prognosis. Despite numerous studies and medical 
advances, it continues to be lethal, with an average life expectancy of 15 
months after chemo-radiotherapy.
DEVELOPMENT: Recent research has addressed several factors associated with the 
diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma; one significant factor is tumour 
localisation, particularly the subventricular zone, which represents one of the 
most active neurogenic niches of the adult human brain. Glioblastomas in this 
area are generally more aggressive, resulting in unfavourable prognosis and a 
shorter life expectancy. Currently, the research into microRNAs (miRNA) has 
intensified, revealing different expression patterns under physiological and 
pathophysiological conditions. It has been reported that the expression levels 
of certain miRNAs, mainly those related to neurogenic processes, are 
dysregulated in oncogenic events, thus favouring gliomagenesis and greater 
tumour aggressiveness. This review discusses some of the most important miRNAs 
involved in subventricular neurogenic processes and their association with 
glioblastoma aggressiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA regulation and function play an important role in the 
development and progression of glioblastoma; understanding the alterations of 
certain miRNAs involved in both differentiation and neural and glial maturation 
could help us to better understand the malignant characteristics of 
glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION: The Community Ageing Research 75+ (CARE75+) study is a 
longitudinal cohort study collecting extensive health and social data, with a 
focus on frailty, independence and quality of life in older age. CARE75+ was the 
first international experimental frailty research cohort designed using trial 
within cohorts (TwiCs) methodology, aligning epidemiological research with 
clinical trial evaluation of interventions to improve the health and well-being 
of older people. CARE75+ REMOTE is an extension of CARE75+ using a remote model 
that does not require face-to-face interactions for data collection in the 
current circumstances of a global pandemic and will provide an efficient, 
sustainable data collection model.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective cohort study using TwiCs. One thousand 
community-dwelling older people (≥75 years) will be recruited from UK general 
practices by telephone. Exclusions include: nursing home/care home residents; 
those with an estimated life expectancy of 3 months or less; and people 
receiving palliative care.
DATA COLLECTION: Assessments will be conducted by telephone, web-submission or 
postal questionnaire: baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 
months and 36 months. Measures include activities of daily living, mood, 
health-related quality of life, comorbidities, medications, frailty, informal 
care, healthcare and social care service use. Consent will be sought for data 
linkage and invitations to additional studies (sub-studies).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: CARE75+ was approved by the National Research Ethics 
Service (NRES) Committee Yorkshire and the Humber-Bradford Leeds 10 October 2014 
(14/YH/1120). CARE75+ REMOTE (amendment 13) was approved on the 18th November 
2020. Consent is sought if an individual is willing to participate and has 
capacity to provide informed consent. Consultee assent is sought if an 
individual lacks capacity. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed 
scientific journals and conferences. Results will be summarised and disseminated 
to study participants via newsletters, local engagement events and on a bespoke 
website.

BACKGROUND: Although routine NHS data potentially include all patients, 
confounding limits their use for causal inference. Methods to minimise 
confounding in observational studies of implantable devices are required to 
enable the evaluation of patients with severe systemic morbidity who are 
excluded from many randomised controlled trials.
OBJECTIVES: Stage 1 - replicate the Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial 
(TOPKAT), a surgical randomised controlled trial comparing unicompartmental knee 
replacement with total knee replacement using propensity score and instrumental 
variable methods. Stage 2 - compare the risk benefits and cost-effectiveness of 
unicompartmental knee replacement with total knee replacement surgery in 
patients with severe systemic morbidity who would have been ineligible for 
TOPKAT using the validated methods from stage 1.
DESIGN: This was a cohort study.
SETTING: Data were obtained from the National Joint Registry database and linked 
to hospital inpatient (Hospital Episode Statistics) and patient-reported outcome 
data.
PARTICIPANTS: Stage 1 - people undergoing unicompartmental knee replacement 
surgery or total knee replacement surgery who met the TOPKAT eligibility 
criteria. Stage 2 - participants with an American Society of Anesthesiologists 
grade of ≥ 3.
INTERVENTION: The patients were exposed to either unicompartmental knee 
replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the postoperative Oxford 
Knee Score. The secondary outcome measures were 90-day postoperative 
complications (venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and prosthetic 
joint infection) and 5-year revision risk and mortality. The main outcome 
measures for the health economic analysis were health-related quality of life 
(EuroQol-5 Dimensions) and NHS hospital costs.
RESULTS: In stage 1, propensity score stratification and inverse probability 
weighting replicated the results of TOPKAT. Propensity score adjustment, 
propensity score matching and instrumental variables did not. Stage 2 included 
2256 unicompartmental knee replacement patients and 57,682 total knee 
replacement patients who had severe comorbidities, of whom 145 and 23,344 had 
linked Oxford Knee Scores, respectively. A statistically significant but 
clinically irrelevant difference favouring unicompartmental knee replacement was 
observed, with a mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score difference of < 2 points 
using propensity score stratification; no significant difference was observed 
using inverse probability weighting. Unicompartmental knee replacement more than 
halved the risk of venous thromboembolism [relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence 
interval 0.15 to 0.74) using propensity score stratification; relative risk 0.39 
(95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.96) using inverse probability weighting]. 
Unicompartmental knee replacement was not associated with myocardial infarction 
or prosthetic joint infection using either method. In the long term, 
unicompartmental knee replacement had double the revision risk of total knee 
replacement [hazard ratio 2.70 (95% confidence interval 2.15 to 3.38) using 
propensity score stratification; hazard ratio 2.60 (95% confidence interval 1.94 
to 3.47) using inverse probability weighting], but half of the mortality [hazard 
ratio 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.74) using propensity score 
stratification; insignificant effect using inverse probability weighting]. 
Unicompartmental knee replacement had lower costs and higher quality-adjusted 
life-year gains than total knee replacement for stage 2 participants.
LIMITATIONS: Although some propensity score methods successfully replicated 
TOPKAT, unresolved confounding may have affected stage 2. Missing Oxford Knee 
Scores may have led to information bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Propensity score stratification and inverse probability weighting 
successfully replicated TOPKAT, implying that some (but not all) propensity 
score methods can be used to evaluate surgical innovations and implantable 
medical devices using routine NHS data. Unicompartmental knee replacement was 
safer and more cost-effective than total knee replacement for patients with 
severe comorbidity and should be considered the first option for suitable 
patients.
FUTURE WORK: Further research is required to understand the performance of 
propensity score methods for evaluating surgical innovations and implantable 
devices.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as EUPAS17435.

(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in

website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: We compared the risks and benefits of partial and total 
knee replacements in NHS patients with a complex medical history who would 
normally be excluded from randomised trials on this topic. We used information 
that was collected during hospital appointments for people who had a knee 
replacement between 2009 and 2016. It is difficult to directly compare the two 
groups because each individual patient has a different medical history. We 
tested advanced statistical methods to account for these differences. In stage 
1, we showed that some of these advanced statistical methods could replicate the 
results of a recently published surgical trial using routine data from the NHS. 
We compared patients in the trial with similar patients who were operated on in 
the NHS. Three of the proposed methods showed results similar to those obtained 
from the Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT). In stage 2, we used 
the successful methods from stage 1 to study the risks, benefits and costs of 
partial and total knee replacement surgery in patients with complex medical 
histories. Two of the statistical methods found that patients who had a partial 
knee replacement had less self-reported pain and better function after surgery 
than patients who had a total knee replacement. All three methods found that 
partial knee replacement was safer, was associated with a lower risk of blood 
clots (a known complication of knee surgery) and had lower mortality over 5 
years. However, patients who had a partial knee replacement were twice as likely 
as those with a total knee replacement to need a second surgery within 5 years. 
We found that partial knee replacements were less costly to the NHS and were 
associated with better overall quality of life for patients than total knee 
replacement.

STUDY DESIGN: General population utility valuation study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a technique for calculating 
utilities from the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) Score.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The ability to calculate quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) would enhance treatment 
decision making and facilitate economic analysis. QALYs are calculated using 
utilities.
METHODS: We recruited a sample of 760 adults from a market research panel. Using 
an online discrete choice experiment, participants rated eight choice sets based 
on mJOA health states. A multiattribute utility function was estimated using a 
mixed multinomial-logit regression model. The sample was partitioned into a 
training set used for model fitting and validation set used for model 
evaluation.
RESULTS: The regression model demonstrated good predictive performance on the 
validation set with an area under the curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 
0.80-0.82)). The regression model was used to develop a utility scoring rubric 
for the mJOA. Regression results revealed that participants did not regard all 
mJOA domains as equally important. The rank order of importance was (in 
decreasing order): lower extremity motor function, upper extremity motor 
function, sphincter dysfunction, upper extremity sensation.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a simple technique for converting the mJOA score 
to utilities and quantify the importance of mJOA domains. The ability to 
evaluate QALYs for DCM will facilitate economic analysis and patient counseling. 
Clinicians should heed these findings and offer treatments that maximize 
function in the attributes viewed most important by patients.Level of Evidence:
