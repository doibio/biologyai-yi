care center. Forty-five adults (Mage = 30.73 years) completed measures of lung 
function, depression, anxiety, pain, breathlessness catastrophizing, and HRQoL 
at one time point.
RESULTS: Results of a hierarchical multiple regression indicate that increased 
breathlessness catastrophizing was related to poorer HRQoL, after controlling 
for lung function, depression, anxiety, and pain (p < .05). Depression, pain, 
and breathlessness catastrophizing all emerged as significant unique predictors 
of HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Breathlessness catastrophizing is a potential target for clinical 
intervention and might impact HRQoL. Further research on breathlessness 
catastrophizing in CF is warranted including longitudinal studies to examine the 
mechanisms by which breathlessness catastrophizing relates to HRQoL and 
treatment outcomes in CF.

INTRODUCTION: E-cigarette dependence measures largely focus on e-cigarette use 
("vaping") that is linked to nicotine use, and measures assessing sensory 
aspects of vaping that may influence use (e.g., taste) are limited in scope. 
Thus, we developed the novel Sensory E-cigarette Expectancies Scale (SEES).
METHODS: In Summer 2017, 610 adult e-cigarette users (48.7% male, 84.9% White, 
37.41[±12.15] years old) completed an online survey that included 23 SEES items. 
Psychometric analyses included evaluating latent structure, internal 
consistency, measurement invariance, mean differences, and test-criterion 
relationships.
RESULTS: Factor analyses supported a 9-item, 3-subscale structure (taste/smell, 
pleasure/satisfaction, vapor cloud production). Subscales evidenced internal 
consistency and scalar invariance by sex, race, smoking status (current/not), 
vaping status (daily/not), e-liquid nicotine content (yes/no), and device type 
(cig-a-likes/vape-pens/Advanced Personal Vaporizers [APVs]/Mods). Women and 
daily e-cigarette users reported stronger SEEs for taste/smell and pleasure than 
their counterparts. Non-white participants reported stronger SEEs for cloud 
production than White participants. Cig-a-like users reported the weakest SEEs 
for taste/smell and weaker SEEs linked to cloud production than APV/mod users. 
SEES scores evidenced convergence with nicotine dependence (mean r = .36). 
Finally, SEES scores predicted vaping frequency and habitual vaping concurrently 
and incrementally beyond nicotine dependence.
CONCLUSIONS: The SEES evidenced good psychometric properties, suggesting that 
the measure can be used to assess sensory vaping expectancies in adults. 
Importantly, SEES scores indicated that sensory expectancies are related, yet 
distinct, from nicotine dependence. Future research should evaluate how SEEs 
relate to product characteristic preferences and patterns of vaping including 
the development and maintenance of addiction.

Health, Sharq, Kuwait, dr.s.aldallal@outlook.com.

Acromegaly is an uncommon, chronic disease, characterized by hypersecretion of a 
pituitary growth hormone by somatotroph adenomas, along with increased levels of 
insulin-like growth factor-1. Although acromegaly presents a wide array of 
clinical manifestations, the salient symptoms include acral and soft tissue 
enlargement, joint pain, heart and respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, and 
hypertension, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Hence, early 
diagnosis of the disease is critical to enhance life expectancy and quality of 
life. New approaches are being developed for diagnosis and surveillance (both 
screening and follow-up), including sensitive biochemical assays and the use of 
MRI to visualize extremely small tumors, and are helpful in the early diagnosis 
of acromegaly, subsequent treatment, and disease control. This mini-review 
summarizes the most common and effective tools used in the diagnosis of 
acromegaly.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy has improved the life expectancy of 
patients living with HIV. However, lipodystrophy syndrome (LD) remains 
prevalent, affecting mostly patients treated with first-generation 
antiretroviral drugs. This syndrome is characterized by changes in body fat 
distribution with or without associated metabolic changes. Here, we studied 
whether clinically evaluated LD is independently associated with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) development (sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) in HIV-positive patients.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study (the LIPOKID Study) among all 
the patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with an eGFR >60 ml/min per 
1.73 m2 upon their entry into the cohort with more than 3 months of follow-up 
from January 2002 to August 2016. Cox regression models were used to estimate 
the association between LD and CKD development.
RESULTS: Among the 5384 patients included, 1341 (24.9%) developed LD during the 
follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 72.3 months (SD ±48.4). In total, 252 
patients (4.7%) reached the primary endpoint after a median time of 51.3 months 
(±SD 39.9 months) from inclusion. A diagnosis of LD significantly increased the 
risk of an eGFR on univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.72; 95% confidence 
interval [95% CI] = 2.07-3.58; P < 0.001) and remained significantly higher 
after adjustment for known HIV and non-HIV risk factors for CKD (HR = 2.37; 95% 
CI = 1.67-3.36; P < 0.001). The effect of LD on CKD was not mediated through the 
use of nephrotoxic antiretroviral drugs.
CONCLUSION: Lipodystrophy syndrome is independently associated with CKD after 
adjustment for previously reported risk factors.

Mutations in the clk-1 gene impair mitochondrial ubiquinone biosynthesis and 
extend lifespan in C. elegans. We demonstrate here that this life extension is 
linked to the repression of cytoplasmic mRNA translation, independent of the 
alleged nuclear form of CLK-1. Clk-1 mutations inhibit polyribosome formation 
similarly to daf-2 mutations that dampen insulin signaling. Comparisons of total 
versus polysomal RNAs in clk-1(qm30) mutants reveal a reduction in the 
translational efficiencies of mRNAs coding for elements of the translation 
machinery and an increase in those coding for the oxidative phosphorylation and 
autophagy pathways. Knocking down the transcription initiation factor TAF-4, a 
protein that becomes sequestered in the cytoplasm during early embryogenesis to 
induce transcriptional silencing, ameliorates the clk-1 inhibition of 
polyribosome formation. These results underscore a prominent role for the 
repression of cytoplasmic protein synthesis in eukaryotic lifespan extension and 
suggest that mutations impairing mitochondrial function are able to exploit this 
repression similarly to reductions of insulin signaling. Moreover, this report 
reveals an unexpected role for TAF-4 as a repressor of polyribosome formation 
when ubiquinone biosynthesis is compromised.

INTRODUCTION: Sexual activity is often an important component of life. To date, 
no studies have examined sexual activity before and after total hip arthroplasty 
(THA) in male patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The purpose of the 
current study was to evaluate the effect of THA on sexual activity and to 
explore the most commonly reported and comfortable coital position for male AS 
patients with hip involvement.
METHODS: Data from 31 male AS patients who underwent THA for hip involvement 
were retrospectively reviewed. Information from the International Index of 
Erectile Function (IIEF), the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and other clinical 
parameters was collected and monitored over time. We compared the 
above-mentioned parameters before surgery and 2 years after surgery and analysed 
the correlation between changes on the IIEF and changes in clinical parameters.
RESULTS: The domain and total scores of the IIEF, except EF, were significantly 
higher after surgery than were those before surgery ( p < 0.05). There was a 
significant positive correlation between changes on the IIEF and improvement in 
flexion-extension range of motion (ROM), adduction-abduction ROM and HHS ( p < 
0.05). Most patients (26/31, 83.9%) resumed sexual activity 5-12 weeks after 
surgery. The pre- and postoperative distributions of the most commonly reported 
and comfortable position were not significantly different (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Successful THA may improve sexual activity in male AS patients with 
hip involvement. Changes in hip ROM show the most significant correlation with 
improvement in sexual activity. Resumption of sexual activity occurs within 5-12 
postoperative weeks.

Survival after lung transplantation lags behind outcomes of other solid organ 
transplants, and complications from lung transplant are the second most common 
cause of death in cystic fibrosis. Evolving surgical techniques, therapeutics, 
and perioperative management have improved short-term survival after lung 
transplantation, yet have not translated into significant improvement in 
long-term mortality. Areas covered: We review risk factors for poor long-term 
outcomes among patients with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation to 
highlight areas for improvement. This includes reasons for organ dysfunction, 
complications of immunosuppression, further exacerbation of extrapulmonary 
complications of cystic fibrosis, and quality of life. A literature search was 
performed using PubMed-indexed journals. Expert commentary: There are multiple 
medical and socioeconomic barriers that threaten long-term survival following 
lung transplant for patients with cystic fibrosis. An understanding of the 
causes of each could elucidate treatment options. There is a lack of 
prospective, multicenter, randomized control trials due to cost, complexity, and 
feasibility. Ongoing prospective studies should be reserved for the most 
promising interventions identified in retrospective studies in order to improve 
long-term outcomes.

The world is aging and we must face the challenges that this brings. One of the 
reasons for the increasing aging of the world's population is the increase in 
life expectancy and, since we live longer, it is of paramount importance to live 
well and to prevent age-associated diseases. In this way, it is crucial to 
improve knowledge of the aging process and of the mechanisms that contribute to 
it. Ideally it would be of great interest to have a panel of biomarkers of 
healthy aging that would allow an estimate of the biological age of an 
individual. One of the changes that greatly contribute to aging is the loss of 
protein homeostasis, also called proteostasis. To ensure the proper function of 
cells and to maintain cellular proteostasis, organisms have developed systems to 
control protein synthesis, folding and degradation. Loss or dysfunction of 
proteostasis is at the root of many well-studied human neurological diseases, 
such as Alzheimer's disease and, more recently, it has been implicated in the 
aging process with some reports showing long-lived animals to have improved 
proteostasis. Growing evidence suggests a strong link between modifications in 
the quantity and/or activity of several players involved in proteostasis and 
longevity. In this review, we give an overview of the main characteristics of 
aging with focus on proteostasis. We present how changes in components of 
proteostasis, during aging, impact the lifespan of model organisms. We also 
briefly review the current state of aging biomarkers and discuss the potential 
of proteostasis network components as markers of healthy aging.

Ang1 is a soluble ligand to receptor Tie2, and increasing the circulating Ang1 
level may improve vascular stabilization under certain disease conditions. Here, 
we found that the circulating Ang1 level was significantly increased in 
cynomolgus monkeys treated with non-neutralizing anti-Ang1 antibodies. Improving 
the antibodies' pharmacokinetic properties by IgG Fc mutations further increased 
the circulating Ang1 level. However, the mutations decreased the thermal 
stability of the molecules, which may limit their use as therapeutic antibodies. 
Nevertheless, we showed that non-neutralizing antibodies may have therapeutic 
potential by increasing the level of a target molecule in the circulation.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by a qualitative alteration in social 
interaction and communication associated with restricted interests and 
stereotyped behaviors. This condition will accompany people throughout their 
lives, with variations in their evolution. Our objectives were to know the 
evolutionary characteristics of people with autistic spectrum disorder, 
analyzing cognitive, behavioral, health, mortality and their needs in the aging 
stage, which will guide the planning of specific support resources. We analyze 
studies related to the evolution in adult life in people with this disorder, 
with or without identified entities, and socio-health conditions that should be 
considered in the aging process. The knowledge about aging in people with autism 
is still scarce and it is difficult to define a specific pattern because this 
will depend, among other factors, on the etiology, the degree, the presence of 
intellectual disability and/or epilepsy, and the scope in where live, which can 
even condition the life expectancy. Aging has been associated with mood 
disorders, depression, deterioration in executive functions and episodic memory, 
although it is difficult to differentiate it from natural aging in people with 
typical development. The identification of a specific entity will allow to know 
the possible evolution and prevent complications in syndromes that may be 
associated with autism: fragile X, Down, Angelman, Rett and Williams, for that 
reason we rank the genetic and neurological consultation.

In Rwanda, as in other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, life expectancy of 
people living with HIV (PLWH) has increased dramatically as a result of combined 
antiretroviral therapy (cART). People living with HIV can now live longer but 
with increasing rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Thus, prevention of 
NCD comorbidities in PWLHI is crucial to maintain and gain health-related 
benefits and to maximise the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the 
long-term management of PLWH. This study determines the association between 
physical and mental health-related dimensions of quality of life (QOL) with 
behavioural and biological risk factors, after controlling socio-demographic and 
HIV-related factors in adults living with HIV in Rwanda. A cross-sectional study 
using the WHO STEPwise approach and Kinyarwanda version of the MOS-HIV Health 
Survey, risk factors for NCDs and HRQOL were analysed for 794 PLWH, both HIV+ on 
ART and ART-naïve. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the 
relationship between CMD risk factors and physical health and mental health 
summary scores. A total of 794 participants were interviewed. The mean age of 
the sample was 37.9 (±10.8) years and the majority of the participants were 
women (n = 513; 64.6%). About 16.2% reported daily smoking, 31.4% reported 
harmful alcohol use and 95% reported insufficient consumption of vegetables and 
fruits while 26.1% reported being physically inactive. 18.4% were overweight 
43.4% had abdominal obesity, i.e. waist-hip-ratio (WHR) ≥0.95 in males and 0.85 
in females. High blood pressure (HBP), i.e. systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 
≥140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg was 24.4%. The results 
reveal that mean physical health summary and mental health summary score values 
were 63.96 ± 11.68 and 53.43 ± 10.89, respectively. While participants indicated 
that tobacco users and those who had abdominal obesity reported poor mental 
HRQOL, physical inactivity and hypertension have a negative impact on physical 
HRQOL. In addition, certain socio-demographic and HIV-related variables - 
specifically being unmarried, lack of HIV disclosure and low CD4 count (less 350 
cell counts /mm3) - were associated with significantly lower mental and physical 
dimensions of quality of life. The results of this study reveal that behavioural 
and biological risk factors for NCDs were significantly associated with a lower 
HRQOL. These research findings also suggest that the assessment of the 
association between behavioural and biological risk factors for NCDs and a HRQOL 
provides opportunities for targeted counselling and secondary prevention 
efforts, so that health care providers can implement strategies that have a 
significant impact on the HRQOL.

BACKGROUND: A multi-centre field trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 
afoxolaner based chewables (NexGard® or NexGard Spectra®) for the treatment of 
generalised demodicosis caused by Demodex canis in dogs under field conditions 
in France, Italy and Poland.
METHODS: Client-owned dogs, diagnosed positive for Demodex mites by 
pre-treatment skin scrapings and presenting clinical signs of generalised 
demodicosis were included. Dogs were orally treated with afoxolaner three times 
at monthly intervals. Of the 50 dogs enrolled, 48 completed the whole study. 
Efficacy of the treatments was assessed monthly by Demodex mite counts and 
physical examination with special regard to the severity and extension of skin 
lesions.
RESULTS: Treatments were well tolerated in all dogs and resulted in a rapid 
reduction of mites, with all post-treatment mite counts significantly lower than 
baseline. The number of mites was reduced by 87.6%, 96.5% and 98.1% on Days 28, 
56 and 84, respectively. In addition, the skin lesion severity and extent scores 
as well as the pruritus were all significantly lower at all post-treatment 
visits compared to the pre-treatment assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: This clinical field study demonstrated that monthly administrations 
of afoxolaner in NexGard® or NexGard Spectra®, offered a convenient and reliable 
solution for the treatment of canine generalised demodicosis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most persons infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the 
United States were born from 1945 through 1965; testing is recommended for this 
cohort. However, HCV incidence is increasing among younger persons in many parts 
of the country and treatment is recommended for all adults with HCV infection. 
We aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of universal 1-time screening for 
HCV infection in all adults living in the United States and to determine the 
prevalence of HCV antibody above which HCV testing is cost effective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov state transition model to estimate the effects of 
universal 1-time screening of adults 18 years or older in the United States, 
compared with the current guideline-based strategy of screening adults born from 
1945 through 1965. We compared potential outcomes of 1-time universal screening 
of adults or birth cohort screening followed by antiviral treatment of those 
with HCV infection vs no screening. We measured effectiveness with 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and costs with 2017 US dollars.
RESULTS: Based on our model, universal 1-time screening of US residents with a 
general population prevalence of HCV antibody greater than 0.07% cost less than 
$50,000/QALY compared with a strategy of no screening. Compared with 1-time 
birth cohort screening, universal 1-time screening and treatment cost 
$11,378/QALY gained. Universal screening was cost effective compared with birth 
cohort screening when the prevalence of HCV antibody positivity was greater than 
0.07% among adults not in the cohort born from 1945 through 1965.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a Markov state transition model, we found a strategy of 
universal 1-time screening for chronic HCV infection to be cost effective 
compared with either no screening or birth cohort-based screening alone.

PURPOSE: The ability to locate and remove all malignant lesions during radical 
prostatectomy leads not only to prevent biochemical recurrence (BCR) and 
possible side effects but also to improve the life expectancy of patients with 
prostate cancer. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has emerged as a technique 
that uses fluorescence to highlight cancerous cells and guide surgeons to resect 
tumors in real time. Thus, development of tumor-specific near-infrared (NIR) 
agents that target biomarkers solely expressed on prostate cancer cells will 
enable to assess negative tumor margins and affected lymph nodes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because PSMA is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in 
>90% of the prostate cancer patient population, a prostate-specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA)-targeted NIR agent (OTL78) was designed and synthesized. Optical 
properties, in vitro and in vivo specificity, tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), 
accomplishment of negative surgical tumor margins using FGS, pharmacokinetics 
(PKs) properties, and preclinical toxicology of OTL78 were then evaluated in 
requisite models.
RESULTS: OTL78 binds to PSMA-expressing cells with high affinity, concentrates 
selectively to PSMA-positive cancer tissues, and clears rapidly from healthy 
tissues with a half-time of 17 minutes. It also exhibits an excellent TBR (5:1) 
as well as safety profile in animals.
CONCLUSIONS: OTL78 is an excellent tumor-specific NIR agent for use in 
fluorescence-guided radical prostatectomy and FGS of other cancers.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of three 
multipathogen point-of-care (POC) testing strategies for detecting common 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with standard laboratory 
testing.
DESIGN: Modelling study.
SETTING: Genitourinary medicine (GUM) services in England.
POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of 965 988 people, representing the annual 
number attending GUM services symptomatic of lower genitourinary tract 
infection.
INTERVENTIONS: The decision tree model considered costs and reimbursement to GUM 
services associated with diagnosing and managing STIs. Three strategies using 
hypothetical point-of-care tests (POCTs) were compared with standard care (SC) 
using laboratory-based testing. The strategies were: A) dual POCT for Chlamydia 
trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG); B) triplex POCT for CT-NG and 
Mycoplasma genitalium (MG); C) quadruplex POCT for CT-NG-MG and Trichomonas 
vaginalis (TV). Data came from published literature and unpublished estimates.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were total costs and 
benefits (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) for each strategy (2016 GB, £) 
and associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between each of the 
POC strategies and SC. Secondary outcomes were inappropriate treatment of STIs, 
onward STI transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease in women, time to cure and 
total attendances.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, POC strategy C, a quadruplex POCT, was the 
most cost-effective relative to the other strategies, with an ICER of £36 585 
per QALY gained compared with SC when using microcosting, and cost-savings of 
£26 451 382 when using tariff costing. POC strategy C also generated the most 
benefits, with 240 467 fewer clinic attendances, 808 fewer onward STI 
transmissions and 235 135 averted inappropriate treatments compared with SC.
CONCLUSIONS: Many benefits can be achieved by using multipathogen POCTs to 
improve STI diagnosis and management. Further evidence is needed on the 
underlying prevalence of STIs and SC delivery in the UK to reduce uncertainty in 
economic analyses.

Oriented smooth muscle layers in the intestine contract rhythmically due to the 
action of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) that serve as pacemakers of the 
intestine. Disruption of ICC networks has been reported in various intestinal 
motility disorders, which limit the quality and expectancy of life. A 
significant challenge in intestinal smooth muscle engineering is the rapid loss 
of function in cultured ICC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Here we demonstrate a 
novel approach to maintain the function of both ICC and SMC in vitro. Primary 
intestinal SMC mixtures cultured on feeder cells seeded electrospun 
poly(3-caprolactone) scaffolds exhibited rhythmic contractions with 
directionality for over 10 weeks in vitro. The simplicity of this system should 
allow for wide usage in research on intestinal motility disorders and tissue 
engineering, and may prove to be a versatile platform for generating other types 
of functional SMC in vitro.

Health Benefits of Exercise for People Living With HIV: A Review of the 
Literature.

With life expectancy increasing and the symptomatology of HIV being altered 
since the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), we now have begun to see 
metabolic changes with negative implications among people living with HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA). Some of these changes include increased blood lipids, central fat 
accumulation, lipodystrophy, and decreased aerobic capacity. All of which are 
known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. 
A common practice among healthy and other clinical populations to help modify 
these risk factors is some form of aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or a 
combination of both. It has been demonstrated that PLWHA could respond in a 
similar manner, which in turn may enhance life expectancy and/or quality of 
life. The purpose of this literature review was to examine the evidence of 
health benefits of routine exercise training among PLWHA since the advent of 
ART. Although limited in strength because of small sample sizes and limited 
intervention durations, there is overall consistency in the general findings. An 
overview of the findings would indicate that physical activity and exercise are 
both safe and effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness, metabolic 
profile, and quality of life among PLWHA.

Blue Zones: Lessons From the World's Longest Lived.

Buettner D(1), Skemp S(1).

Author information:

What began as a National Geographic expedition, lead by Dan Buettner, to uncover 
the secrets of longevity, evolved into the discovery of the 5 places around the 
world where people consistently live over 100 years old, dubbed the Blue Zones. 
Dan and his team of demographers, scientist and anthropologists were able to 
distill the evidence-based common denominators of these Blue Zones into 9 
commonalities that they call the Power 9. They have since taken these principles 
into communities across the United States working with policy makers, local 
businesses, schools and individuals to shape the environments of the Blue Zones 
Project Communities. What has been found is that putting the responsibility of 
curating a healthy environment on an individual does not work, but through 
policy and environmental changes the Blue Zones Project Communities have been 
able to increase life expectancy, reduce obesity and make the healthy choice the 
easy choice for millions of Americans.

As the number of people living with chronic diseases climbs upward, novel 
methods to address the root causes of these disease are necessary to transform 
the state of our nation's health and our health care system. Interventions 
directed at making lasting lifestyle changes can have a major impact on the 
overall health of patients. In this pilot study, 4 obese patients, with 
unhealthy habits and abnormal blood profiles and biometrics, were able to 
significantly improve their lifestyles and their lab values with the 3-month 
intervention of a lifestyle medicine team, including a physician trained in 
lifestyle medicine, a certified wellness coach, a licensed nutrition specialist, 
a physical therapist, and a licensed mental health professional. Two patients 
had type 2 diabetes, and all 4 were hypertensive (blood pressure > 120/80 mm 
Hg). After the intervention, all improved their nutrition and increased their 
physical activity. In addition, all experienced improvements in lipid counts, 
blood pressure, weight loss, and cholesterol. The diabetic patients' levels of 
hemoglobin A1C dropped to normal. These successes show the benefits of a 
lifestyle medicine team approach.

Cardiovascular outcomes and safety with antidiabetic drugs.

Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia.

Type 2 diabetes is a debilitating disease that impacts the life expectancy, 
quality of life, and health of an individual. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a 
common diabetes-associated complication and a principal cause for death in 
diabetic patients. This review aims to investigate and summarize the effect of 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) medications on CVD issues. A comprehensive 
literature review mainly from level 1 evidence was performed. Thirty-seven 
articles were extracted from Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and PubMed 
Database using a combination of keywords. The findings suggest that different 
glucose-lowering agents have been tested for their efficacy and safety in T2DM 
with CVD. Some of the recent trials such as the "United Kingdom Prospective 
Diabetes Study," "Empagliflozin (EMPA) Cardiovascular (CV) Outcome Event Trial 
in T2DM Patients-Removing Excess Glucose" (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), "Liraglutide 
Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of CV Outcome Results," and "Trial to 
Evaluate CV and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 
2 Diabetes" (SUSTAIN6) have shed important light on this vital clinical concern, 
thus demonstrating a convincing effect of liraglutide, semaglutide, and EMPA on 
CVD outcomes, while metformin is thought to be the first-line optimal oral agent 
to manage Type 2 diabetics. Some classes of drugs demonstrate CV protection, 
some of them may be a result of a class effect, and some differences might be 
based on the population enrolled individually. Most of the trials failed to show 
a significant benefit with regard to mortality and morbidity in spite of 
intensive glycemic control. This study, therefore, enabled us to develop a guide 
of potential antidiabetic medication that can influence or promote CV health. 
Health professionals in future should weigh the CV risk against possible 
advantages while prescribing antidiabetic medications.

Work related injuries (WRIs) are a growing public health concern that remains 
under-recognized, inadequately addressed and largely unmeasured in low and 
middle-income countries (LMIC's). However, even in high-income countries, such 
as those in Gulf Cooperating Council (GCC) like Qatar, there are challenges in 
assuring the health and safety of its labor population. Countries in the GCC 
have been rapidly developing as a result of the economic boom from the 
petrochemical industry during the early seventies. Economic prosperity has 
propelled the migration of workers from less developed countries to make up for 
the human resource deficiency to develop its infrastructure, service and 
hospitality industries. Although these countries have gradually made huge gains 
in health, economy and human development index, including improvements in life 
expectancy, education, and standard of living, there remains a high incidence of 
work-related injuries especially in jobs in the construction and petrochemical 
sector. Currently, there is scarcity of literature on work-related injuries, 
especially empirical studies documenting the burden, characteristics and risk 
factors of work injuries and the work injured population, which includes large 
numbers of migrant workers in many GCC countries. This paper will focus on the 
current understanding of WRIs in those countries and identify the gaps in 
current approaches to workplace injury prevention, outlining current status of 
WRI prevention efforts in Qatar, and propose a framework of concerted action by 
multi-sectoral engagement.

Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is an 
infantile autosomal recessive disease caused by the loss of the ubiquitously 
expressed IGHMBP2 gene. SMARD1 causes degeneration of alpha-motor neurons, 
resulting in distal muscle weakness, diaphragm paralysis, and respiratory 
malfunction. We have reported that delivery of a low dose of AAV9-IGHMBP2 to the 
CNS results in a significant rescue of the SMARD1 mouse model (nmd). To examine 
how a delivery route can impact efficacy, a direct comparison of intravenous 
(IV) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of AAV9-IGHMBP2 was performed. 
Using a low-dose, both IV and ICV delivery routes led to a significant extension 
in survival and increased body weight. Conversely, only ICV-treated animals 
demonstrated improvements in the hindlimb muscle, neuromuscular junction, and 
motor function. The hindlimb phenotype of IV-treated mice resembled the 
untreated nmd mice. We investigated whether the increased survival of IV-treated 
nmd mice was the result of a positive impact on the cardiac function. Our 
results revealed that cardiac function and pathology were similarly improved in 
IV- and ICV-treated mice. We concluded that while IV delivery of a low dose does 
not improve the hindlimb phenotype and motor function, partial restoration of 
cardiac performance is sufficient to significantly extend survival.
