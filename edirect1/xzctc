Lactic acid bacteria are the main bacterial group associated to meat spoilage. 
Herbal essential oils are promising alternatives that can be used to retard 
lactic acid bacterial growth and extend shelf life of meat products. In this 
study, the influence of oregano and rosemary essential oils on the growth of 
lactic acid bacteria and the physicochemical properties of refrigerated 
vacuum-packed Tuscan sausage was evaluated. In addition to the control (without 
the addition of oil), the sausage samples were separately treated with different 
concentrations of each essential oil (0.05 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.2 wt%, and 0.4 wt%). 
The shelf life was evaluated as the time to the lactic acid bacteria population 
to reach the levels of 106 and 107 CFU/g. After the addition of 0.05 wt% and 
0.1 wt% of essential oil to the sausage, the rosemary essential oil provided a 
higher extension of the shelf life of the sausages (approximately 3 and 5 days, 
respectively) than the oregano essential oil (approximately 1 and 3 days, 
respectively). After adding 0.2 wt% and 0.4 wt% of essential oil, the oregano 
essential oil resulted in a larger increase of the shelf life of the samples 
(about 8 and 14 days, respectively) when compared with the rosemary essential 
oil (about 7 to 11 days, respectively). All the treatments slowed the growth of 
the lactic acid bacteria but they did not change the maximum bacterial 
population. New empirical models that relate the shelf life of the sausage and 
the maximum specific growth rate of the lactic acid bacteria with the oil 
concentration were obtained. These results can be applied to model the influence 
of essential oils on the shelf life of different meat products.

Aims: The Biventricular vs Right Ventricular Pacing in Heart Failure Patients 
with Atrioventricular Block (BLOCK-HF) demonstrated that biventricular (BiV) 
pacing resulted in better clinical and structural outcomes compared to right 
ventricular (RV) pacing in patients with atrioventricular (AV) block and reduced 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ≤50%). This study investigated the 
cost-effectiveness of BiV vs RV pacing in the patient population enrolled in the 
BLOCK-HF trial. Methods: All-cause mortality, New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
Class distribution over time, and NYHA-specific heart failure (HF)-related 
healthcare utilization rates were predicted using statistical models based on 
BLOCK-HF patient data. A proportion-in-state model calculated cost-effectiveness 
from the Medicare payer perspective. Results: The predicted patient survival was 
6.78 years with RV and 7.52 years with BiV pacing, a 10.9% increase over 
lifetime. BiV pacing resulted in 0.41 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
compared to RV pacing, at an additional cost of $12,537. The "base-case" 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $30,860/QALY gained. Within the 
clinical sub-groups, the highest observed ICER was $43,687 (NYHA Class I). 
Patients receiving combined BiV pacing and defibrillation (BiV-D) devices were 
projected to benefit more (0.84 years gained) than BiV pacemaker (BiV-P) 
recipients (0.49 years gained), compared to dual-chamber pacemakers. 
Conclusions: BiV pacing in AV block patients improves survival and attenuates HF 
progression compared to RV pacing. ICERs were consistently below the US 
acceptability threshold ($50,000/QALY). From a US Medicare perspective, the 
additional up-front cost associated with offering BiV pacing to the BLOCK-HF 
patient population appears justified.

BACKGROUND: Demand for gastrointestinal endoscopy in Australia is increasing as 
a result of the expanding national bowel cancer screening program and a growing, 
ageing population. More services are required to meet demand and ensure patients 
are seen within clinically recommended timeframes.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to project endoscopy 
waiting list outcomes for two large metropolitan health services encompassing 8 
public hospitals in Australia. The model applied routinely collected health 
service data to forecast the impacts of future endoscopic demand over 5 years 
and to identify the level of service activity required to address patient 
waiting times and meet key policy targets. The approach incorporated evidence 
from the literature to produce estimates of cost-effectiveness by showing longer 
term costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) associated with service 
expansion.
RESULTS: The modelling revealed that doing nothing would lead to the number of 
patients waiting longer than clinically recommended doubling across each health 
service within 5 years. A 38% overall increase in the number of monthly 
procedures available was required to meet and maintain a target of 95-98% of 
patients being seen within clinically recommended timeframes to the year 2021. 
This was projected to cost the funder approximately $140 million in additional 
activity over a 5 year period. Due to improved patient outcomes associated with 
timely intervention, it was estimated that the increased activity would generate 
over 22,000 additional QALYs across the two health services. This translated to 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6467 and $5974 per QALY for each 
health service respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Discrete event simulation modelling provided a rational, data based 
approach that allowed decision makers to quantify the future demand for 
endoscopy services and identify cost-effective strategies to meet community 
needs.

Denmark experienced major socioeconomic changes, including overall population 
growth, during the Viking, medieval and post-medieval periods from ca. AD 800 to 
1800. Archaeological skeletons provide a unique perspective on the population 
structure of Ribe, a Danish town in Jutland, during the millennium that 
immediately precedes the industrialization of northern Europe. This skeletal 
study adds temporal depth to our understanding of an overall trend toward longer 
life as seen from historical records and in modern studies. Adult male and 
female mean age at death and mortality profiles during three time periods are 
based on 943 adult skeletons from three urban cemeteries that collectively 
represent a cross-section of this urban community. For both males and females, 
the mean age at death decreased slightly from the Viking (males 38.5 years, 
females 38.6 years) to the medieval (males 37.4 years, females 36.9 years) 
periods. This decline was followed by an increase in mean age at death for both 
sexes from the medieval to post-medieval (males 40.4 years, females 43.2 years) 
periods, a notable gain of 3.0 and 6.3 years for men and women, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is commonly treated with vascular 
endothelial growth factor or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. As new 
therapies emerge, interest grows in gaining a deeper understanding of treatment 
sequences. Recently, we developed a patient-level, discretely integrated 
condition event (DICE) simulation to estimate survival and lifetime costs for 
various cancer therapies, using a US payer perspective. Using this model, we 
explored the impact of treatments such as nivolumab and cabozantinib, and 
compared the clinical outcomes and cost consequences of commonly used treatment 
algorithms for patients with advanced RCC.
METHODS: Included treatment sequences were pazopanib or sunitinib as first-line 
treatment, followed by nivolumab, cabozantinib, axitinib, pazopanib or 
everolimus. Efficacy inputs were derived from the CheckMate 025 trial and a 
network meta-analysis based on available literature. Safety and cost data were 
obtained from publicly available sources or literature.
RESULTS: Based on our analysis, the average cost per life-year (LY) was lowest 
for sequences including nivolumab (sunitinib → nivolumab, $75,268/LY; pazopanib 
→ nivolumab, $84,459/LY) versus axitinib, pazopanib, everolimus and cabozantinib 
as second-line treatments. Incremental costs per LY gained were $49,592, $73,927 
and $30,534 for nivolumab versus axitinib, pazopanib and everolimus-containing 
sequences, respectively. The model suggests that nivolumab offers marginally 
higher life expectancy at a lower cost versus cabozantinib-including sequences.
CONCLUSION: Treatment sequences using nivolumab in the second-line setting are 
less costly compared with sequential use of targeted agents. In addition to 
efficacy and safety data, cost considerations may be taken into account when 
considering treatment algorithms for patients with advanced RCC.

BACKGROUND: We undertook this study to assess the incremental cost per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the use of pan-genotypic sofosbuvir (SOF) 
+ velpatasvir (VEL) for HCV patients, as compared to the current treatment 
regimen under the universal free treatment scheme in Punjab state.
METHODOLOGY: A Markov model depicting natural history of HCV was developed to 
simulate the progression of disease. Three scenarios were compared: I (Current 
Regimen)-use of SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) for non-cirrhotic patients and 
ledipasvir (LDV) or DCV with SOF ± ribavirin (RBV) according to the genotype for 
cirrhotic patients; II-use of SOF + DCV for non-cirrhotic patients and use of 
SOF+VEL for compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis 
patients) and III-use of SOF+VEL for both non-cirrhotic and compensated 
cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients). The lifetime 
costs, life-years and QALYs were assessed for each scenario, using a societal 
perspective. All the future costs and health outcomes were discounted at an 
annual rate of 3%. Finally, the incremental cost per QALY gained was computed 
for each of scenario II and III, as compared to scenario I and for scenario III 
as compared to II. In addition, we evaluated the lifetime costs and QALYs among 
HCV patients for each of scenario I, II and III against the counterfactual of 
'no universal free treatment scheme' scenario which involves patients purchasing 
care in routine setting of from public and private sector.
RESULTS: Each of the scenarios I, II and III dominate over the no universal free 
treatment scheme scenario, i.e. have greater QALYs and lesser costs. The use of 
SOF+VEL only for cirrhotic patients (scenario II) increases QALYs by 0.28 (0.03 
to 0.71) per person, and decreases the cost by ₹ 5,946 (₹ 1,198 to ₹ 14,174) per 
patient, when compared to scenario I. Compared to scenario I, scenario III leads 
to an increase in QALYs by 0.44 (0.14 to 1.01) per person, and is cost-neutral. 
While the mean cost difference between scenario III and I is-₹ 2,676 per 
patient, it ranges from a cost saving of ₹ 14,835 to incurring an extra cost of 
₹ 3,456 per patient. For scenario III as compared II, QALYs increase by 0.16 
(0.03 to 0.36) per person as well as costs by ₹ 3,086 per patient which ranges 
from a cost saving of ₹ 1,264 to incurring an extra cost of ₹ 6,344. Shift to 
scenario II and III increases the program budget by 5.5% and 60% respectively.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of SOF+VEL is highly recommended for the treatment 
of HCV infection. In comparison to the current practice (scenario I), scenario 
II is a dominant option. Scenario III is cost-effective as compared to scenario 
II at a threshold of one-time GDP per capita. If budget is an important 
constraint, velpatasvir should be given to HCV infected cirrhotic patients. 
However, if no budget constraint, universal use of velpatasvir for HCV treatment 
is recommended.

We investigated the effects of sling-based, suspended push-up training on muscle 
size and function of upper limb and abdominal muscles. Eight men conducted 
suspended push-ups to failure 3 sets/session, 3 sessions/week, for 8 weeks. The 
maximum number of push-ups during training gradually and significantly increased 
from the first to last training session (+92%), suggesting improved muscle 
endurance. After the training, muscle thickness of the elbow extensors (+16%) 
and flexors (+3%), as well as abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis: RA,+27%; 
external oblique: EO,+14%) significantly increased. No changes occurred in 
maximum isometric strength of elbow extension or flexion, nor in 1-repetition 
maximum bench press. In a follow-up experiment, electromyograms (EMGs) of RA, EO 
and internal oblique (IO) during suspended push-ups to failure were measured and 
normalized to those during maximum voluntary contraction of each muscle (% 
EMGmvc) in six men. EMG significantly increased when reaching failure in all 
muscles (RA: 46-88%, EO: 32-50%, IO: 19-52%, start-end), and was particularly 
high in RA. These results suggest that suspended push-up training can augment 
size of not only upper limb but also abdominal muscles, likely attributable to 
high muscle activities during exercise; however, this does not necessarily 
improve maximum strength after training thus warrants careful 
interpretation/application.

Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the 
United States. Surgery is considered the gold standard treatment. Techniques 
include curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, and Mohs 
micrographic surgery. While each is effective, there are relative advantages and 
disadvantages with respect to cost, time, quality of life, and role in patients 
with limited life expectancy. Preventing local tumor recurrence is the primary 
objective; however, recurrence rates are based on retrospective data, and 
high-quality comparator studies assessing effectiveness are scarce. Prospective 
and randomized controlled trials are imperative to create comprehensive, 
evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of NMSC.

The number of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgeries is expected to soar, and 
an effective nonoperative rehabilitation program is needed. We began treating 
patients with knee osteoarthritis with a range-of-motion (ROM) -based 
rehabilitation program that was delivered systematically, starting with ROM 
exercises for knee extension, followed by exercises for flexion and swelling 
reduction, before starting a strengthening program. In a group of 396 patients, 
significant improvements were made in knee extension, flexion, and KOOS 
subjective scores for pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport, and 
quality of life. Furthermore, the program prevented 76% of patients from 
undergoing TKA surgery.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the quality of end-of-life care 
for patients with advanced CKD. We describe the relationship between patterns of 
end-of-life care and dialysis treatment with family-reported quality of 
end-of-life care in this population.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed a retrospective 
observational study among a national cohort of 9993 veterans with advanced CKD 
who died in Department of Veterans Affairs facilities between 2009 and 2015. We 
used logistic regression to evaluate associations between patterns of 
end-of-life care and receipt of dialysis (no dialysis, acute dialysis, 
maintenance dialysis) with family-reported quality of end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Overall, 52% of cohort members spent ≥2 weeks in the hospital in the 
last 90 days of life, 34% received an intensive procedure, and 47% were admitted 
to the intensive care unit, in the last 30 days, 31% died in the intensive care 
unit, 38% received a palliative care consultation in the last 90 days, and 36% 
were receiving hospice services at the time of death. Most (55%) did not receive 
dialysis, 12% received acute dialysis, and 34% received maintenance dialysis. 
Patients treated with acute or maintenance dialysis had more intensive patterns 
of end-of-life care than those not treated with dialysis. After adjustment for 
patient and facility characteristics, receipt of maintenance (but not acute) 
dialysis and more intensive patterns of end-of-life care were associated with 
lower overall family ratings of end-of-life care, whereas receipt of palliative 
care and hospice services were associated with higher overall ratings. The 
association between maintenance dialysis and overall quality of care was 
attenuated after additional adjustment for end-of-life treatment patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CKD, care focused on life extension 
rather than comfort was associated with lower family ratings of end-of-life care 
regardless of whether patients had received dialysis.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has increased the life expectancy of 
HIV patients. However, the incidence of non-AIDS associated lung comorbidities, 
such as COPD and asthma, and that of opportunistic lung infections have become 
more common among this population. HIV proteins secreted by the anatomical HIV 
reservoirs can have both autocrine and paracrine effects contributing to the 
HIV-associated comorbidities. HIV has been recovered from cell-free 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, alveolar macrophages, and intrapulmonary 
lymphocytes. We have recently shown that ex-vivo cultured primary bronchial 
epithelial cells and the bronchial brushings from human subjects express 
canonical HIV receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 and can be infected with HIV. 
Together these studies suggest that the lung tissue can serve as an important 
reservoir for HIV. In this report, we show that TGF-β1 promotes HIV latency by 
upregulating a transcriptional repressor BLIMP-1. Furthermore, we identify 
miR-9-5p as an important intermediate in TGF-β-mediated BLIMP-1 upregulation and 
consequent HIV latency. The transcriptionally suppressed HIV can be reactivated 
by common latency reactivating agents. Together our data suggest that in 
patients with chronic airway diseases, TGF-β can elevate the HIV viral reservoir 
load that could further exacerbate the HIV associated lung comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of urinary lithiasis has been increasing in recent 
decades at all ages, including the elderly. In parallel, the world population is 
aging and there is a paucity of data on treatment of urinary stones in very 
elderly people. Our main objective was to evaluate the effects of extracorporeal 
shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) in patients older than 75 years, and the 
characteristics of this population. Complications and mortality rates after this 
procedure in octogenarians were also described.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated very elderly patients who underwent ESWL 
at our institution from 1998 to 2015, through chart review, telephone 
interviews, and consultation with the municipal mortality information program. 
Measured outcomes included demographic and clinical data, ESWL characteristics 
and complications, interval between ESWL and death, and cause of death.
RESULTS: Demographic and treatment characteristics were similar between very 
elderly and younger patients who underwent ESWL during the same period. No 
severe complications occurred among older patients. Octogenarians treated in our 
cohort had a significant life expectancy when ESWL procedures were performed. 
Even though 38.9% of the patients passed away during the studied period, 
mortality occurred on average 4.38 years after the ESWL session.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, ESWL has been used by urologists as a first-line 
treatment for uncomplicated urinary calculi in very elderly patients. Despite 
changes associated with aging, and the high prevalence of comorbidities, this 
procedure seems to be safe and well tolerated in elderly people.

This study examined if imagery ability (i.e., vividness and temporal congruence 
between imagined and executed knee extensions) and imagery perspective 
preference were affected by ageing and gender. Ninety-four participants, 31 
young, 43 intermediate, and 20 older adults completed the Vividness of Movement 
Imagery Questionnaire-2 and a knee extension temporal congruence test to reflect 
on their imagery ability and an imagery perspective preference test. Male 
participants had a better imagery ability than the female participants (F (4, 
85) = 2.84, p = .029, η 2 = .118). However, significant age-related changes in 
imagery ability were not found in the three age groups. Change in imagery 
perspective preference with a trend towards an external imagery perspective was 
observed with ageing (F (3, 89) = 3.16, p = .028, η 2 = .096) but not between 
male and female. The results suggest that imagery ability may be preserved with 
ageing. As individuals age, their preference for using an imagery perspective 
shifts from a more internal to a more external perspective. This understanding 
is important when designing future imagery research and real-life application or 
clinical intervention.

Introduction: The key important factor influencing the outcomes following 
rehabilitation is the surgical approach involved in Total Knee Replacement 
(TKR). Most studies have analysed the functional outcome in comparing the 
approaches on surgical perspective rather on post-operative therapeutic 
interventions. The current study was to analyse the effects of structured TKR 
rehabilitation programme on the quality of life and joint specific outcomes 
between two different surgical approaches. Materials and Methods: In this 
double-blind randomised controlled trial, participants were randomly allocated 
to one of two groups: Group 1- those who underwent medial parapatellar approach 
and Group 2- those who underwent mid-vastus approach. Both groups received 
three-phase structured rehabilitation protocol for 12 weeks. The outcome 
measures of SF-36, knee mobility, isometric knee musculature strength and 
six-minute walk distance were measured at baseline, on discharge and at review 
after three months. Results: The quality of life and joint specific outcome 
scores were better in mid-vastus approach than the popular medial parapatellar 
approach. The outcomes of knee flexion mobility (p=0.04), knee extension 
mobility (p=0.03), isometric muscle strength of quadriceps (p=0.001), isometric 
muscle strength of hamstrings (p=0.03), six-minute walk distance (p=0.001) and 
Physical Cumulative Scores (PCS) (p=0.03) were found to exhibit significant 
improvements at three months follow up. Conclusion: The mid-vastus approach was 
found to exhibit better improvements following structured rehabilitation care, 
in physical summary scores of quality of life and joint specific outcomes than 
medial parapatellar approach.

The aims of this study were to provide life expectancy (LE) estimates of cancer 
patients at diagnosis and LE changes over time since diagnosis to describe the 
impact of cancer during patients' entire lives. Cancer patients' LE was 
calculated by standard period life table methodology using the relative survival 
of Italian patients diagnosed in population-based cancer registries in 1985-2011 
with follow-up to 2013. Data were smoothed using a polynomial model and years of 
life lost (YLL) were calculated as the difference between patients' LE and that 
of the age- and sex-matched general population. The YLL at diagnosis was highest 
at the youngest age at diagnosis, steadily decreasing thereafter. For patients 
diagnosed at age 45 years, the YLL was above 20 for lung and ovarian cancers and 
below 6 for thyroid cancer in women and melanoma in men. LE progressively 
increased in patients surviving the first years, decreasing thereafter, to 
approach that of the general population. YLL in the long run mainly depends on 
attained age. Providing quantitative data is essential to better define clinical 
follow-up and plan health care resource allocation. These results help assess 
when the excess risk of death from tumour becomes negligible in cancer 
survivors.

Preventing the negative impact of maltreatment on children's mental health 
requires interventions to be contextually sensitive, grounded in theory and 
research, and effective in reaching and retaining children and families. This 
study replicates and extends previous findings of the Fostering Healthy Futures 
(FHF) program, a 30-week mentoring and skills group intervention for 
preadolescent maltreated children in foster care. Participants included 426 
children recently placed in out-of-home care who were randomized to intervention 
or control conditions. Outcomes measured 6-10 months postintervention included a 
multi-informant (child, caregiver, teacher) index of mental health problems as 
well as measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, dissociative symptoms, 
quality of life, and use of mental health services and psychotropic medications. 
There were high rates of program initiation, retention, and engagement; 95% of 
those randomized to FHF started the program, 92% completed it, and over 85% of 
the mentoring visits and skills groups were attended. The FHF program 
demonstrated significant impact in reducing mental health symptomatology, 
especially trauma symptoms, and mental health service utilization. These program 
effects were consistent across almost all subgroups, suggesting that FHF confers 
benefit for diverse children. Results indicate that positive youth development 
programming is highly acceptable to children and families and that it can 
positively impact trauma and its sequelae.

HIV-infected patients have increased risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). 
HIV+ patients in Africa are experiencing growing comorbidities due to increase 
in life expectancy and long-time antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV prevalence in 
Malawi is one of highest in the world (10.8% in women and 6.4% in men); few data 
are available about NCDs epidemiology in HIV+ elderly patients in Malawi. A 
retrospective analysis of routine medical records in 14 health centers run by 
Disease Relief through Excellent and Advanced Means (DREAM) program in Malawi 
was carried out. All HIV+ patients aged >40 years in care in the period January 
01, 2017-December 31, 2018 were included. Clinical and laboratory features were 
collected in the last visit of the study period. Files from 7,071 patients 
(62.1% women) in ART were analyzed, 362 (5.1%) were aged >65 years. Median time 
on ART was 98.9 (64.8-118.0) months; median body mass index, haemoglobin (HB), 
and CD4 count were, respectively, 21.63 kg/m2 (19.5-24.5), 13 mg/dL (12-14), and 
457 cell/mm3 (328-613). Elderly patients >65 years were more likely to be 
malnourished (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-2.59), 
diagnosed with arterial hypertension (OR = 2.5, CI: 1.94-3.43), affected with 
diabetes (OR = 2.7, CI: 1.25-6.22), have macrocytic anemia (OR = 2.5, CI: 
2.00-3.35), and increased serum creatinine (OR = 1.5, CI: 1.03-2.43]). Other 
factors were associated with NCD burden, but age remained always independently 
related. Two concomitant chronic conditions in addition to HIV were present in 
19.2% (66/343) of elderly people and 5.2% (338/6.454) of patients aged <65 years 
(OR = 4.3, CI: 3.22-5.76). Some associations were observed: nevirapine (NVP) was 
associated with kidney disease (OR = 1.5, CI: 1.22-2.06), NVP and protease 
inhibitor (PI) with hypertension (OR = 2.79, CI: 2.16-3.35 and OR = 2.15, CI: 
1.52-3.02), azidothymidine (AZT) with macrocytic anemia (OR = 15.6, CI: 
13.18-18.68). NVP, AZT, and duration of any ART >3 years were associated with 
the presence of two or more comorbidities (OR = 2.1 1.54-2.96, OR = 2.6 
1.87-3.71, and OR = 1.7 1.12-2.84). Our data show the burden of NCDs in aging 
HIV+ patients in Malawi. The expansion of HIV treatment programs will require 
special attention to such comorbidities in elderly patients.

New technologies may displace existing, higher-value care under a fixed budget. 
Countries aim to curtail adoption of low-value technologies, for example, by 
installing cost-effectiveness thresholds. Our objective is to estimate the 
opportunity cost of hospital care to identify a threshold value for the 
Netherlands. To this aim, we combine claims data, mortality data and quality of 
life questionnaires from 2012 to 2014 for 11,000 patient groups to obtain 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) outcomes and spending. Using a fixed effects 
translog model, we estimate that a 1% increase in hospital spending on average 
increases QALY outcomes by 0.2%. This implies a threshold of €73,600 per QALY, 
with 95% confidence intervals ranging from €53,000 to €94,000 per QALY. The 
results stipulate that new technologies with incremental cost effectiveness 
ratios exceeding the Dutch upper reference value of €80,000 may indeed displace 
more valuable care.

Exploring Students' Descriptions of Mutation from a Cognitive Perspective 
Suggests How to Modify Instructional Approaches.

Prior studies have shown that students have difficulty understanding the role of 
mutation in evolution and genetics. However, little is known about unifying 
themes underlying students' difficulty with mutation. In this study, we examined 
students' written explanations about mutation from a cognitive science 
perspective. According to one cognitive perspective, scientific phenomena can be 
perceived as entities or processes, and the miscategorization of processes as 
entities can lead to noncanonical ideas about scientific phenomena that are 
difficult to change. Students' incorrect categorization of processes as entities 
is well documented in physics but has not been studied in biology. Unlike other 
scientific phenomena that have been studied, the word "mutation" refers to both 
the process causing a change in the DNA and the entity, the altered DNA, making 
mutation a relevant concept for exploration and extension of this theory. In 
this study, we show that, even after instruction on mutation, the majority of 
students provided entity-focused descriptions of mutation in response to a 
question that prompted for a process-focused description in a lizard or a 
bacterial population. Students' noncanonical ideas about mutation occurred in 
both entity- and process-focused descriptions. Implications for conceptual 
understanding and instruction are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by 
constitutional pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, 
leading to increased risk of colorectal, endometrial and other cancers. The 
study aimed to identify the incremental costs and consequences of strategies to 
identify Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the relative 
cost-effectiveness of reflex testing strategies for identifying Lynch syndrome 
in women with endometrial cancer taking the NHS perspective and a lifetime 
horizon. Model input parameters were sourced from various published sources. 
Consequences were measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000/QALY was used.
RESULTS: Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome using MMR immunohistochemistry and 
MLH1 methylation testing was cost-effective versus no testing, costing £14 200 
per QALY gained. There was uncertainty due to parameter imprecision, with an 
estimated 42% chance this strategy is not cost-effective compared with no 
testing. Age had a significant impact on cost-effectiveness, with testing not 
predicted to be cost-effective in patients aged 65 years and over.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing for Lynch syndrome in younger women with endometrial cancer 
using MMR immunohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation testing may be 
cost-effective. Age cut-offs may be controversial and adversely affect 
implementation.
