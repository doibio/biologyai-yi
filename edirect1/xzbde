20.8% between 1990 and 2010, mainly due to population growth and aging. While 
DALYs due to severe periodontitis and untreated caries increased, those due to 
severe tooth loss decreased. DALYs differed by age groups and regions, but not 
by genders. The findings highlight the challenge in responding to the diversity 
of urgent oral health needs worldwide, particularly in developing communities.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric oncology guidelines state that fit older men with prostate 
cancer should receive curative treatment. In a population-based study, we 
investigated associations between age and non-receipt of curative treatment in 
men with localised prostate cancer, and the effect of clinical variables on this 
in different age groups.
METHODS: Clinically localised prostate cancers (T1-T2N0M0) diagnosed from 2002 
to 2008 among men aged ≥ 40 years, with hospital in-patient episode(s) within 1 
year post-diagnosis, were included (n=5456). Clinical and socio-demographic 
variables were obtained from cancer registrations. Comorbidity was determined 
from hospital episode data. Logistic regression was used to investigate 
associations between age and non-receipt of treatment, adjusting for 
confounders; the outcome was non-receipt of curative treatment (radical 
prostatectomy or radiotherapy).
RESULTS: The percentage who did not receive curative treatment was 9.2%, 14.3%, 
48.2% and 91.7% for men aged 40-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+ years, respectively. 
After adjusting for clinical and socio-demographic factors, age remained the 
main determinant of treatment non-receipt. Men aged 70-79 had a significant 
five-fold increased risk of not having curative treatment compared with men aged 
60-69 (odds ratio (OR)=5.5; 95% confidence interval 4.7, 6.5). In age-stratified 
analyses, clinical factors had a higher weight for men aged 60-69 than in other 
age strata. Over time, non-receipt of curative treatment increased among men 
aged 40-59 and decreased among men aged 70-79.
CONCLUSION: Age remains the dominant factor in determining non-receipt of 
curative treatment. There have been some changes in clinical practice over time, 
but whether these will impact on prostate cancer mortality remains to be 
established.

India.

BACKGROUND: The reduction in fertility level, reinforced by steady increase in 
the life expectancy has produced fundamental changes in the age structure of the 
population, which in turn leads to the aging population.
OBJECTIVES: To know the psycho-social problems of the elderly in urban 
population of Mysore; to determine the extent of functional impairment among the 
elderly and to know the psychological distress of the elderly using GHQ score.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This community-based cross-sectional study was carried 
out at the field practice area of Urban Health Center, JSS Medical College, 
Mysore. The study population comprises of all geriatric population aged 60 years 
or above who were residing in the study area for atleast one year. 526 study 
subjects were recruited for the study. Data collection was done from May 2011 to 
December 2011 using a preformed semi-structured schedule. Data was entered into 
Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis is carried out using SPSS-17 version.
RESULTS: 162 out of 207 elderly men (78.3%) were more functional than 240 out of 
319 aged women (75.2%). Severe functional impairment was almost same in both 
gender (4%) while moderate imparement was noted slightly more among aged women. 
The functional score was significantly higher for young old, for literates, for 
middle class and for employed. Anxiety and insomnia were found in 3.4% of the 
aged (males 2.4% and females 4.1%) followed by somatic symptoms 2.9%, social 
dysfunction 1.5% and severe depression 1.1%. All psychological distress were 
found more among elderly women. The prevalence of mental illnesses were found to 
be significantly higher for age more than 75 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness among the elderly population should be created for 
regular medical check-ups to ensure prevention and early detection of the 
chronic diseases. There is a need to have geriatric wards having specialized 
professionals with psychiatric and medical social workers along with subsidized 
health care services.

The genetic theory of infectious diseases: a brief history and selected 
illustrations.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, life expectancy at birth averaged 20 years 
worldwide, owing mostly to childhood fevers. The germ theory of diseases then 
gradually overcame the belief that diseases were intrinsic. However, around the 
turn of the twentieth century, asymptomatic infection was discovered to be much 
more common than clinical disease. Paradoxically, this observation barely 
challenged the newly developed notion that infectious diseases were 
fundamentally extrinsic. Moreover, interindividual variability in the course of 
infection was typically explained by the emerging immunological (or somatic) 
theory of infectious diseases, best illustrated by the impact of vaccination. 
This powerful explanation is, however, best applicable to reactivation and 
secondary infections, particularly in adults; it can less easily account for 
interindividual variability in the course of primary infection during childhood. 
Population and clinical geneticists soon proposed a complementary hypothesis, a 
germline genetic theory of infectious diseases. Over the past century, this idea 
has gained some support, particularly among clinicians and geneticists, but has 
also encountered resistance, particularly among microbiologists and 
immunologists. We present here the genetic theory of infectious diseases and 
briefly discuss its history and the challenges encountered during its emergence 
in the context of the apparently competing but actually complementary 
microbiological and immunological theories. We also illustrate its recent 
achievements by highlighting inborn errors of immunity underlying eight 
life-threatening infectious diseases of children and young adults. Finally, we 
consider the far-reaching biological and clinical implications of the ongoing 
human genetic dissection of severe infectious diseases.

Disease control priorities for neglected tropical diseases: lessons from 
priority ranking based on the quality of evidence, cost effectiveness, severity 
of disease, catastrophic health expenditures, and loss of productivity.

Strømme EM, Baerøe K, Norheim OF.

BACKGROUND: In the context of limited health care budgets in countries where 
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are endemic, scaling up disease control 
interventions entails the setting of priorities. However, solutions based solely 
on cost-effectiveness analyses may lead to biased and insufficiently justified 
priorities.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper are to 1) demonstrate how a range of 
equity concerns can be used to identify feasible priority setting criteria, 2) 
show how these criteria can be fed into a multi-criteria decision-making matrix, 
and 3) discuss the conditions under which this decision-making procedure should 
be carried out in a real-world decision-making context.
METHODS: This paper draws on elements from theories of decision analysis and 
ethical theories of fair resource allocation. We explore six typical NTD 
interventions by employing a modified multi-criteria decision analysis model 
with predefined criteria, drawn from a priority setting guide under development 
by the WHO. To identify relevant evidence for the six chosen interventions, we 
searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases.
DISCUSSION: Our in vitro multi-criteria decision analysis suggested that case 
management for visceral leishmaniasis should be given a higher priority than 
mass campaigns to prevent soil-transmitted helminthic infections. This seems to 
contradict current health care priorities and recommendations in the literature. 
We also consider procedural conditions that should be met in a contextualised 
decision-making process and we stress the limitations of this study exercise.
CONCLUSION: By exploring how several criteria relevant to the multi-facetted 
characteristics of NTDs can be taken into account simultaneously, we are able to 
suggest how improved priority settings among NTDs can be realised.

Cost-effectiveness outcomes of the national gastric cancer screening program in 
South Korea.

BACKGROUND: Although screening is necessary where gastric cancer is particularly 
common in Asia, the performance outcomes of mass screening programs have 
remained unclear. This study was conducted to evaluate cost-effectiveness 
outcomes of the national cancer screening program (NCSP) for gastric cancer in 
South Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: People aged 40 years or over during 2002-2003 (baseline) 
were the target population. Screening recipients and patients diagnosed with 
gastric cancers were identified using the NCSP and Korea Central Cancer Registry 
databases. Clinical outcomes were measured in terms of mortality and life-years 
saved (LYS) of gastric cancer patients during 7 years based on merged data from 
the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation and National Statistical 
Office. We considered direct, indirect, and productivity-loss costs associated 
with screening attendance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimates 
were produced according to screening method, sex, and age group compared to 
non-screening.
RESULTS: The age-adjusted ICER for survival was 260,201,000-371,011,000 Korean 
Won (KW; 1USD=1,088 KW) for the upper-gastrointestinal (UGI) tract over 
non-screening. Endoscopy ICERs were lower (119,099,000-178,700,000 KW/survival) 
than UGI. To increase 1 life-year, additional costs of approximately 
14,466,000-15,014,000 KW and 8,817,000-9,755,000 KW were required for UGI and 
endoscopy, respectively. Endoscopy was the most cost-effective strategy for 
males and females. With regard to sensitivity analyses varying based on the 
upper age limit, endoscopy NCSP was dominant for both males and females. For 
males, an upper limit of age 75 or 80 years could be considered. ICER estimates 
for LYS indicate that the gastric cancer screening program in Korea is 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopy should be recommended as a first-line method in Korea 
because it is beneficial among the Korean population.

OBJECTIVES: To apply the most recent evidence from randomised trials of 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and explore the potential value of 
risk assessments to guide the use of PSA screening in practice.
DESIGN: A decision model that incorporated a Markov process was developed in 
2012 to estimate the net benefit and cost of PSA screening versus no screening 
as a function of baseline risk.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-2013s (QALYs) and costs.
RESULTS: The harms of screening outweighed the benefits under a number of 
plausible scenarios. Conclusions were sensitive to the estimated quality-of-life 
impacts of prostate cancer treatment as well as the incidence of cancers not 
detected by screening tests (poorer prognosis) and those that were detected by 
screening tests (better prognosis). The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of PSA screening was $168,611 per QALY for men with average risk, $73,452 
per QALY for men with two times the average risk, and $22,938 [corrected] per 
QALY for men with five times the average risk.
CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening was not found to be cost-effective for men at an 
average-to-high risk of prostate cancer, but may be cost-effective for men at 
very high risk. Inexpensive approaches for identifying men at very high risk are 
needed, as is further research on the size of clinical benefit of early 
detection in this population. The potential for the costs of risk assessment to 
be offset by reduced costs of PSA screening also warrants investigation.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the long-term comparative effectiveness of first-line 
treatment in patients negative for anti-JC virus (JCV) antibodies with 
glatiramer acetate (GA), fingolimod, or natalizumab for relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a simulation model to estimate the average 20-year 
clinical risks and benefits of GA, fingolimod, and natalizumab for RRMS patients 
initially negative for anti-JCV antibodies.
METHODS: Model inputs included published natural history progressions of the 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), treatment effects from randomized 
controlled trials on slowing disease progression and reducing relapse rates, 
risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and utility preference 
scores. Outputs were long-term risks (PML risk and other non-PML risks), 
benefits (average relapse rate and time to disability [EDSS >7]), and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Compared with GA, natalizumab resulted in 4.6 fewer relapses, 0.6 more 
years of disability free time, 0.0165 more cases of PML per treated patient, and 
an incremental 1.2 QALYs gained. Compared with fingolimod, natalizumab resulted 
in 1.7 fewer relapses, 0.1 more years of disability free time, 0.0165 more cases 
of PML per treated patient, and an incremental 0.4 QALYs gained. The probability 
that incremental QALYs favored natalizumab over GA was 0.963 and natalizumab 
over fingolimod was 0.720.
CONCLUSIONS: Average QALYs, a measure that aggregates across risks and benefits, 
favored natalizumab, suggesting more aggressive early intervention with 
natalizumab in the negative anti-JCV population. For certain decision makers, 
more evidence may be needed to further reduce the uncertainty in these 
comparative projections prior to making population-based adoption decisions.

Advances in the development of vaccines for Alzheimer's disease.

One of the challenges of our society is to find a treatment or cure for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the leading form of age-related dementia and 
with the increase of life expectancy worldwide, the social and economic burden 
from this disease will increase dramatically. It is a progressive and, in regard 
to clinical scores, a highly variable disease. AD pathogenesis has been 
associated with the accumulation, aggregation, and deposition of amyloid beta 
(Abeta) peptides in the brain. Hallmarks of AD are the amyloid plaques 
consisting of fibrillar Abeta and neurofibrillary tangles which are 
intracellular fibrils of hyperphosphorylated tau protein that develop later in 
this disease. The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that Abeta deposition is 
an initial event in the multifactorial pathogenesis and Abeta deposition may 
precede AD symptoms in some patients by at least 20 years. Amyloid beta therapy 
with active and passive immunizations against Abeta has a high possibility to be 
effective in removing Abeta from brain and might thus prevent the downstream 
pathology. Since 2000 a number of clinical trials for AD immunotherapy have 
started, have failed, and are continuing to be pursued. This article will review 
these clinical trials and ongoing research in this regard.

[Specificities of heart failure in the elderly].

Heart failure (HF) is frequent in the elderly population and is associated with 
high mortality, prolonged and frequent hospitalisations. In old patients with 
multiple comorbid diseases, clinical symptoms of HF are less typical and the 
prognosis is poorer. Comprehensive geriatric assessment, using simple tests to 
evaluate cognitive function, falls, depression, malnutrition, dependency, 
comorbidities, context of life and social conditions, is needed in order to 
screen concomitant diseases and loss of autonomy. Because of lack of specific 
studies on octogenarians, most recommendations for HF treatment in this 
population have been extrapolated from data based on younger populations. 
Epidemiological studies show that recommended HF therapies as angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers are underused in elderly patients 
with HF. Reasons for this under prescription are various and include the absence 
of well-defined therapeutic strategy especially in case of preserved ejection 
fraction, the existence of comorbidities and the fear of adverse events. Special 
precautions for the use of HF drugs must be followed because of the 
comorbidities and age-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics. Increase of drug dose must be closely monitored for adverse 
reactions. Overall, the therapeutic strategy must not be based on the subject's 
age, but rather on the individual analysis taking into account the severity of 
the heart disease, the geriatric assessment, the life expectancy and the quality 
of life. Clinical and laboratory monitoring should be intensified, especially in 
case of acute episode (infection, dehydration, introduction of a new treatment, 
fall…). Therefore, monitoring of heart failure in the elderly, involves 
multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiologists, geriatricians, general 
practitioners, pharmacists and paramedical team.

Since the first description of the association between chronic kidney disease 
and heart disease, many epidemiological studies have confirmed and extended this 
finding. As chronic kidney disease progresses, kidney-specific risk factors for 
cardiovascular events and disease come into play. As a result, the risk for 
cardiovascular disease is notably increased in individuals with chronic kidney 
disease. When adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, impaired 
kidney function and raised concentrations of albumin in urine increase the risk 
of cardiovascular disease by two to four times. Yet, cardiovascular disease is 
frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with chronic kidney 
disease. This group of patients should, therefore, be acknowledged as having 
high cardiovascular risk that needs particular medical attention at an 
individual level. This view should be incorporated in the development of 
guidelines and when defining research priorities. Here, we discuss the 
epidemiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiovascular risk in 
patients with chronic kidney disease, and discuss methods of prevention.

  Although progesterone vaginal suppositories (hospital-formulated) are used for 
the treatment of infertility, their half-life is so short that multiple doses 
are required. In this study, we aimed to develop sustained-release vaginal 
suppositories suitable for clinical use which maintain an effective blood 
concentration by once-a-day treatment, and prepared 7 types of suppository 
containing the sustained-release progesterone tablets to characterize their 
sustained-release performance. We selected one candidate suppository among them, 
taking recovery rate, reproducibility, and hardness, as well as the 
sustained-release performance into consideration. The shell of the selected 
suppository is composed of VOSCO S-55 and progesterone for rapid release. The 
molded progesterone tablets for sustained release were embedded inside. The 
distribution of the weight and content of the suppository was limited, and the 
release rate of progesterone was significantly slower than that of a 
conventional progesterone suppository prepared in our hospital. The single-dose 
administration of the selected suppository to five healthy volunteers led to 
significant extension of the blood concentration. We also confirmed the rise of 
the basic value by multiple administration. The simulation comparison suggested 
that the blood progesterone concentration is controlled by once-a-day 
administration of the selected suppository better than twice-a-day 
administration of the conventional suppository. In conclusion, the 
sustained-release vaginal suppository prepared in this study was considered to 
be useful for clinical treatment.

Duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy in people with cystic fibrosis.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(1):CD006682.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory disease is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in 
cystic fibrosis (CF). Life expectancy of people with CF has increased 
dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the major reasons for this increase is 
the mounting use of antibiotics to treat chest exacerbations caused by bacterial 
infections. The optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is not 
clearly defined. Individuals usually receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 
days, but treatment may range from 10 to 21 days. A shorter duration of 
antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance of infection which could lead to 
further lung damage. Prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics are expensive 
and inconvenient and the incidence of allergic reactions to antibiotics also 
increases with prolonged courses. The use of aminoglycosides requires frequent 
monitoring to avoid some of their side effects. However, some organisms which 
infect people with CF are known to be multi-resistant to antibiotics, and may 
require a longer course of treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for 
treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive 
electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books 
and conference proceedings.Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis 
Trials Register: 15 November 2012.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing 
different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory 
exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, 
the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics 
altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No eligible trials were identified.
MAIN RESULTS: No eligible trials were identified.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of 
intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on 
unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should 
improve quality of life and compliance; result in a reduced incidence of drug 
reactions; and be less costly. However, this may not be sufficient to clear a 
chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of an exacerbation. This 
systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, randomised controlled 
trial comparing different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment as it 
has important clinical and financial implications.

care standards. Intervention costs and cost-effectiveness were examined and 
costs to the Niger Health Ministry (MoH) were estimated if they were to scale-up 
the intervention to additional sites.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Facility-based maternal care outcomes and costs 
from pre-quality improvement collaborative baseline monitoring data in 
participating facilities from January to May 2006 were compared with outcomes 
and costs from the same facilities from June 2008 to September 2008. Cost data 
were collected from project accounting records. The MoH costs were determined 
from interviews with clinic managers and quality improvement teams. 
Effectiveness data were obtained from facilities' records.
FINDINGS: The average delivery-cost decreased from $35 before to $28 after the 
collaborative. The USAID/HCI project's incremental cost was $2.43/delivery. The 
collaborative incremental cost-effectiveness was $147/disability-adjusted life 
year averted. If the MoH spread the intervention to other facilities, 
substantive cost-savings and improved health outcomes can be predicted.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The intervention achieved significant positive health 
benefits for a low cost. The Niger MoH can expect approximately 50 per cent 
return on its investment if it implements the collaborative in new facilities. 
The improvement collaborative approach can improve health and save health care 
resources.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This is one of the first studies known to examine 
collaborative quality improvement and economic efficiency in a developing 
country.

The hypothesis tested in this study was that single-gene mutations found 
previously to extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster could do so 
consistently in both long-lived y w and standard w (1118) genetic backgrounds. 
GAL4 drivers were used to express upstream activation sequence (UAS)-responder 
transgenes globally or in the nervous system. Transgenes associated with 
oxidative damage prevention (UAS-hSOD1 and UAS-GCLc) or removal (EP-UAS-Atg8a 
and UAS-dTOR (FRB) ) failed to increase mean life spans in any expression 
pattern in either genetic background. Flies containing a UAS-EGFP-bMSRA (C) 
transgene associated with protein repair were found not to exhibit life 
extension or detectable enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) activity. The 
presence of UAS-responder transgenes was confirmed by PCR amplification and 
sequencing at the 5' and 3' end of each insertion. These results cast doubt on 
the robustness of life extension in flies carrying single-gene mutations and 
suggest that the effects of all such mutations should be tested independently in 
multiple genetic backgrounds and laboratory environments.

The extension of long slender axons is a key process of neuronal circuit 
formation, both during brain development and regeneration. For this, growth 
cones at the tips of axons are guided towards their correct target cells by 
signals. Growth cone behaviour downstream of these signals is implemented by 
their actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. In the first part of this Commentary, 
we discuss the fundamental roles of the cytoskeleton during axon growth. We 
present the various classes of actin- and microtubule-binding proteins that 
regulate the cytoskeleton, and highlight the important gaps in our understanding 
of how these proteins functionally integrate into the complex machinery that 
implements growth cone behaviour. Deciphering such machinery requires 
multidisciplinary approaches, including genetics and the use of simple model 
organisms. In the second part of this Commentary, we discuss how the application 
of combinatorial genetics in the versatile genetic model organism Drosophila 
melanogaster has started to contribute to the understanding of actin and 
microtubule regulation during axon growth. Using the example of dystonin-linked 
neuron degeneration, we explain how knowledge acquired by studying axonal growth 
in flies can also deliver new understanding in other aspects of neuron biology, 
such as axon maintenance in higher animals and humans.

Cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to heroin users for lay overdose 
reversal in Russian cities.

Francisco, CA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to 
illicit opioid users for lay overdose reversal in Russian cities.
METHOD: This study adapted an integrated Markov and decision analytic model to 
Russian cities. The model took a lifetime, societal perspective, relied on 
published literature, and was calibrated to epidemiologic findings.
RESULTS: For each 20% of heroin users reached with naloxone distribution, the 
model predicted a 13.4% reduction in overdose deaths in the first 5 years and 
7.6% over a lifetime; on probabilistic analysis, one death would be prevented 
for every 89 naloxone kits distributed (95% CI = 32-260). Naloxone distribution 
was cost-effective in all deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
and cost-saving if resulting in a reduction in overdose events. Naloxone 
distribution increased costs by US$13 (95% CI = US$3-US$32) and QALYs by 0.137 
(95% CI = 0.022-0.389) for an incremental cost of US$94 per QALY gained (95% 
CI = US$40-US$325). In a worst-case scenario where overdose was rarely witnessed 
and naloxone was rarely used, minimally effective, and expensive, the 
incremental cost was US$1987 per QALY gained. If national expenditures on 
drug-related HIV, tuberculosis, and criminal justice were applied to heroin 
users, the incremental cost was US$928 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Naloxone distribution to heroin users for lay overdose reversal is 
highly likely to reduce overdose deaths in target communities and is robustly 
cost-effective, even within the constraints of this conservative model.

and its relevance for ethnic disparities.

AIM: Cancer burden measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) captures 
survival and disability impacts of incident cancers. In this paper, we estimate 
the prospective burden of disease arising from 27 cancer sites diagnosed in 
2006, by sex and ethnicity; and determine how its distribution differs from that 
for incidence rates alone.
METHODS: Using a prospective approach, Markov and cancer disease models were 
used to estimate DALYs with inputs of population counts, incidence and excess 
mortality rates, disability weights, and background mortality. DALYs were 
discounted at 3.5% per year.
RESULTS: The age standardised Māori:non-Māori incidence rate ratios were 1.00 
for males and 1.19 for females, whereas for DALYs they were greater at 1.42 for 
males and 1.68 for females. The total burden of cancer for 2006 incident cases 
(i.e. not age standardised) was estimated to be approximately 127,000 DALYs. 
Breast (27%), lung (14%) and colorectal (13%) cancers for females and lung 
(16%), colorectal (14%), and prostate (16%) cancers for males were the top 
contributors. By ethnicity, Māori experienced a substantially higher burden from 
lung cancer (around 25% for both sexes).
CONCLUSIONS: Due to Māori both having higher rates of cancers with a worse 
survival (e.g. lung cancer), and tending to have worse survival for each cancer 
site, ethnic disparities in the age-standardised DALY burden were greater than 
those for incidence (rate ratios of 1.52 and 1.07 respectively, sexes pooled).

BACKGROUND: Hypoglycaemic events, particularly nocturnal, affect health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) via acute symptoms, altered behaviour and fear of future 
events. We examined the respective disutility associated with a single event of 
daytime, nocturnal, severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia.
METHODS: Representative samples were taken from Canada, Germany, Sweden, the 
United States and the United Kingdom. Individuals completed an internet-based 
questionnaire designed to quantify the HRQoL associated with different diabetes- 
and/or hypoglycaemia-related health states. HRQoL was measured on a utility 
scale: 1 (perfect health) to 0 (death) using the time trade-off method. Three 
populations were studied: 8286 respondents from the general population; 551 
people with type 1 diabetes; and 1603 with type 2 diabetes. Respondents traded 
life expectancy for improved health states and evaluated the health states of 
well-controlled diabetes and diabetes with non-severe/severe and 
daytime/nocturnal hypoglycaemic events.
RESULTS: In the general population, non-severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic events 
were associated with a 0.007 disutility compared with 0.004 for non-severe 
daytime episodes, equivalent to a significant 63% increase in negative impact. 
Severe daytime and nocturnal events were associated with a 0.057 and a 0.062 
disutility, respectively, which were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: This study applies an established health economic methodology to 
derive disutilities associated with hypoglycaemia stratified by onset time and 
severity using a large multinational population. It reveals substantial 
individual and cumulative detrimental effects of hypoglycaemic events - 
particularly nocturnal - on HRQoL, reinforcing the clinical imperative of 
avoiding hypoglycaemia.

BACKGROUND: The effect of physical activity on mental health has been the 
subject of research for several decades. However, there is a lack of studies 
investigating the association between physical fitness, including both 
cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and depressive symptoms among general 
population. The aim of this study was to determine the association between 
physical fitness and depressive symptoms among young adults.
METHODS: The study population consists of 5497 males and females, members of the 
Northern Finland birth cohort of 1966, who at age 31 completed fitness tests and 
filled in a questionnaire including questions about depressive symptoms 
(Hopkins' Symptom Checklist-25) and physical activity. Cardiorespiratory fitness 
was measured by a 4-min step test and muscular fitness by tests of maximal 
isometric handgrip and isometric trunk extension. The odds ratios (OR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) for having depressive symptoms were calculated for 
quintiles groups of physical fitness using the third, median quintile as 
reference group, and the results were adjusted for potential confounding 
variables.
RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were most common among males and females in the 
lowest quintile group of trunk extension test (OR 1.58 and 95% CI 1.07-2.32 in 
males and OR 1.43 and 95% CI 1.03-2.0 in females) and among males in the lowest 
quintile group of handgrip strength (OR 1.64 95% CI 1.11-2.42) compared to the 
reference group. Level of self-reported physical activity was inversely 
associated with depressive symptoms both in males (OR 1.74 95% CI 1.25-2.36) and 
females (OR 1.36 95% CI 1.05-1.75). The cardiorespiratory fitness was not 
associated with depressive symptoms (OR 1.01 95% CI 0.68-1.49 in males and 0.82 
95% CI 0.57-1.16 in females).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that low level of isometric endurance capacity 
of trunk extensor muscles is associated with high level of depressive symptoms 
in both sexes. In males, also poor handgrip strength is associated with 
increased levels of depressive symptoms. The physical activity level is 
inversely associated with the prevalence of depressive symptoms among young 
adults.

CHEST Investigators; Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical 
Trials Group: Hydroxyethyl starch or saline for fluid resuscitation in intensive 
care. N Engl J Med 2012, 367:1901-1911.
BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) for fluid 
resuscitation have not been fully evaluated, and adverse effects of HES on 
survival and renal function have been reported.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 7,000 patients who had been admitted to an 
intensive care unit (ICU) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 6% HES with a 
molecular weight of 130 kDa and a molar substitution ratio of 0.4 (130/0.4, 
Voluven; Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany) in 0.9% sodium 
chloride or 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) for all fluid resuscitation until ICU 
discharge, death, or 90 days after randomization. The primary outcome was death 
within 90 days. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and failure and 
treatment with renal replacement therapy.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a large-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of 6% HES(130/0.4) in 0.9% saline as compared with 0.9% 
saline alone for fluid resuscitation in a heterogeneous population of adult 
patients in the ICU.
DESIGN: The Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST) was an 
investigator-initiated, multicenter,prospective, blinded, parallel-group, 
randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: The study was set at 32 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand.
SUBJECTS: The subjects were adult patients (>18 years) who were admitted to the 
ICU and who required intravenous fluid above maintenance requirements determined 
by the treating clinician and supported by at least one objective physiological 
criterion. Patients were excluded if they received more than 1 L of 6% HES 
within 24 hours of screening or had one of the following:dialysis-dependent or 
impending dialysis renal failure,computed tomography evidence of non-traumatic 
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or severe traumatic ICH, creatinine of more than 
3.9 mg/dL or urine output of less than 10 mL/hour for 12 hours, sodium of more 
than 160 meq/L, or chloride of more than 130 meq/L. Also excluded were females 
of childbearing age (unless proven not to be pregnant) and patients who had 
post-cardiac surgery status, liver transplant, or burns and those whose death 
was judged to be imminent or whose underlying disease process indicated a life 
expectancy of less than 90 days.
INTERVENTION: If fluid was deemed necessary by the treating clinician by the 
parameters described above, the patient received ‘study’ fluid with identical 
packaging and appearance. The fluid was either 6% HES (130/0.4) in saline 
(Voluven) or 0.9% saline.
OUTCOMES: Th e primary outcome was death within 90 days. Secondary outcomes were 
acute kidney injury (AKI) and failure and treatment with renal replacement 
therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 597 (18.0%) of 3,315 patients in the HES group and 566 
(17.0%) of 3,336 in the saline group died (relative risk (RR) in the HES group 
1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.18; P=0.26). There was no 
significant difference in mortality in six predefined subgroups. AKI--defined by 
RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) 
criteria--occurred in few patients receiving HES (34.6%) compared with saline 
(38%) (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97). However, renal replacement therapy was 
used in 235 (7.0%) of 3,352 patients in the HES group and 196 (5.8%) of 3,375 in 
the saline group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.45; P=0.04). HES was significantly 
associated with more adverse events (5.3% versus 2.8%; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients in the ICU, there was no significant difference in 
90-day mortality between patients resuscitated with 6% HES (130/0.4) or saline. 
However, despite a lower overall rate of AKI, more patients who received 
resuscitation with HES were given renal replacement therapy. (The study was

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an anion channel. In the human 
lung CFTR loss causes abnormal ion transport across airway epithelial cells. As 
a result CF individuals produce thick mucus, suffer persistent bacterial 
infections and have a much reduced life expectancy. Trans-epithelial potential 
difference (Vt) measurements are routinely carried out on nasal epithelia of CF 
patients in the clinic. CF epithelia exhibit a hyperpolarised basal Vt and a 
larger Vt change in response to amiloride (a blocker of the epithelial Na(+) 
channel, ENaC). Are these altered bioelectric properties solely a result of 
electrical coupling between the ENaC and CFTR currents, or are they due to an 
increased ENaC permeability associated with CFTR loss? To examine these issues 
we have developed a quantitative mathematical model of human nasal epithelial 
ion transport. We find that while the loss of CFTR permeability hyperpolarises 
Vt and also increases amiloride-sensitive Vt, these effects are too small to 
account for the magnitude of change observed in CF epithelia. Instead, a 
parallel increase in ENaC permeability is required to adequately fit observed 
experimental data. Our study provides quantitative predictions for the complex 
relationships between ionic permeabilities and nasal Vt, giving insights into 
the physiology of CF disease that have important implications for CF therapy.
