BACKGROUND: Population-based BRCA1/BRCA2 founder-mutation testing has been 
demonstrated as cost effective compared with family history based testing in 
Ashkenazi Jewish women. However, only 1 of the 3 Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/BRCA2 
founder mutations (185delAG[c.68_69delAG]), 5382insC[c.5266dupC]), and 
6174delT[c.5946delT]) is found in the Sephardi Jewish population 
(185delAG[c.68_69delAG]), and the overall prevalence of BRCA mutations in the 
Sephardi Jewish population is accordingly lower (0.7% compared with 2.5% in the 
Ashkenazi Jewish population). Cost-effectiveness analyses of BRCA testing have 
not previously been performed at these lower BRCA prevalence levels seen in the 
Sephardi Jewish population. Here we present a cost-effectiveness analysis for UK 
and US populations comparing population testing with clinical criteria/family 
history-based testing in Sephardi Jewish women.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was built comparing the lifetime costs and effects 
of population-based BRCA1 testing, with testing using family history-based 
clinical criteria in Sephardi Jewish women aged ≥30 years. BRCA1 carriers 
identified were offered magnetic resonance imaging/mammograms and risk-reducing 
surgery. Costs are reported at 2015 prices. Outcomes include breast cancer, 
ovarian cancer, and excess deaths from heart disease. All costs and outcomes are 
discounted at 3.5%. The time horizon is lifetime, and perspective is payer. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year was 
calculated. Parameter uncertainty was evaluated through 1-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Population testing resulted in gain in life expectancy of 12 months 
(quality-adjusted life-year = 1.00). The baseline discounted incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for UK population-based testing was 
£67.04/quality-adjusted life-year and for US population was 
$308.42/quality-adjusted life-year. Results were robust in the 1-way sensitivity 
analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 100% of simulations were 
cost effective at £20,000/quality-adjusted life-year UK and the 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year US willingness-to-pay thresholds. Scenario 
analysis showed that population testing remains cost effective in UK and US 
populations, even if premenopausal oophorectomy does not reduce breast cancer 
risk or if hormone replacement therapy compliance is nil.
CONCLUSION: Population-based BRCA1 testing is highly cost effective compared 
with clinical criteria-driven approach in Sephardi Jewish women. This supports 
changing the paradigm to population-based BRCA testing in the Jewish population, 
regardless of Ashkenazi/Sephardi ancestry.

BACKGROUND: There is controversy regarding treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC) in very elderly individuals, with some suggesting that this population 
may not live long enough to benefit from invasive treatments. Tools to assess 
limited life expectancy (LLE) exist, but performance in the population of very 
elderly individuals with NMSC has not been well defined.
OBJECTIVE: Define comorbidity scores associated with LLE in very elderly 
individuals presenting for management of NMSC.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 488 patients age 85 or older presenting for 
NMSC management between July 1999 through December 2014 was performed. 
Comorbidities were scored by using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) 
and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI). Dates of death, follow-up, 
and overall survival were determined.
RESULTS: ACE-27 and ACCI scores were associated with overall survival; at scores 
of 3 and 7+, respectively, both were associated with less than 50% survival at 
4 years. Patients who underwent Mohs micrographic surgery survived a median of 
20 months longer than patients who did not.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design and referral bias.
CONCLUSIONS: ACE-27 and ACCI scores predicted LLE. The cohort presenting for 
Mohs micrographic surgery had improved survival, despite similar intercohort 
comorbidity. This suggests that additional factors contributed to survival and 
that age and comorbidities alone are inadequate for making NMSC treatment 
decisions in very elderly individuals.

Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions for risk factors correlate weakly 
with global risk factor burden: a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Systematic reviews (SRs) are important for 
health-care decision-makers requiring evidence for interventions that target 
modifiable risk factors to prevent disease. We investigated whether Cochrane SR 
output correlated with risk factor burden as assessed by the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2015.
METHODS: We screened and extracted data from Cochrane reviews and protocols 
published since January 2011 investigating modifiable risk factors as outcomes. 
We calculated Spearman's rank correlation between number of occasions a risk 
factor was an SR outcome and that risk factor's global disease burden in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We also calculated standardized Pearson 
residuals (SPRs) of the variance between the observed and expected frequency of 
a risk factor featuring as an outcome.
RESULTS: We obtained 400 unique SRs and 174 unique protocols from 6,392 Cochrane 
publications. Risk factors were an outcome a total of 965 times. The number of 
SR outcomes and DALYs per risk factor shared a weak-positive correlation 
(r = 0.45) for all risk factors, but was high (r = 0.83) for metabolic risks, 
similar for behavioral risks (r = 0.46), and weak negative for occupational and 
environmental risks (r = -0.40). SPRs for "high total cholesterol", "low bone 
mineral density", "alcohol and drug use" , and "child and maternal malnutrition" 
inferred a higher than expected frequency of outcomes, and for "air pollution", 
"dietary risk", and "unsafe water, sanitation, and hand-washing", fewer than 
expected.
CONCLUSION: Our study investigated whether Cochrane risk factor SRs align with 
global risk factor burden, demonstrating a weak-positive correlation. 
Interventions modifying air pollution and dietary risks were sparsely studied, 
given disease burden.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to the general population, and risk is higher 
among those who received an organ transplant. We performed a cost-effectiveness 
analysis to determine optimal CRC screening strategies for patients with cystic 
fibrosis.
METHODS: We adjusted the existing Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon 
microsimulation model to reflect increased CRC risk and lower life expectancy in 
patients with cystic fibrosis. Modeling was performed separately for individuals 
who never received an organ transplant and patients who had received an organ 
transplant. We modeled 76 colonoscopy screening strategies that varied the age 
range and screening interval. The optimal screening strategy was determined 
based on a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per life-year gained. 
Sensitivity and supplementary analyses were performed, including fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) as an alternative test, earlier ages of 
transplantation, and increased rates of colonoscopy complications, to assess 
whether optimal screening strategies would change.
RESULTS: Colonoscopy every 5 years, starting at age 40 years, was the optimal 
colonoscopy strategy for patients with cystic fibrosis who never received an 
organ transplant; this strategy prevented 79% of deaths from CRC. Among patients 
with cystic fibrosis who had received an organ transplant, optimal colonoscopy 
screening should start at an age of 30 or 35 years, depending on the patient's 
age at time of transplantation. Annual FIT screening was predicted to be 
cost-effective for patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the level of accuracy 
of the FIT in population is not clear.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon microsimulation 
model, we found screening of patients with cystic fibrosis for CRC to be 
cost-effective. Due to the higher risk in these patients for CRC, screening 
should start at an earlier age with a shorter screening interval. The findings 
of this study (especially those on FIT screening) may be limited by restricted 
evidence available for patients with cystic fibrosis.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a 
disabling consequence of disease progression. Surgery can restore or preserve 
physical function, improving access to treatments that increase duration of 
survival; however, advanced patient age may deter oncologists and surgeons from 
considering surgical management.
PURPOSE: Evaluate the duration of ambulation and survival in elderly patients 
following surgical decompression of MESCC.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective file review of a prospective database, under 
institutional review board (IRB) waiver of informed consent, of consecutive 
patients treated in an academic tertiary care medical center from August 2008 to 
March 2015.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients ≥65 years presenting neurological and/or radiological 
signs of cord compression because of metastatic disease, who underwent surgical 
decompression.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of ambulation and survival.
METHODS: Patients underwent urgent multidisciplinary evaluation and surgery. 
Ambulation and survival were compared with age, pre-, and postoperative 
neurological (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] Impairment Scale [AIS]) 
and performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS]), and Tokuhashi Score 
using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, Pearson correlation 
coefficient, Cox regression model, log-rank analysis, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Forty patients were included (21 male, 54%; mean age 74 years, range 
65-87). Surgery was performed a mean 3.8 days after onset of motor symptoms. 
Mean duration of ambulation and survival were 474 (range 0-1662) and 525 days 
(range 11-1662), respectively; 53% of patients (21 of 40) survived and 43% (17 
of 40) retained ambulation for ≥1 year. There was no significant relationship 
between survival and ambulation for patients aged 65-69, 70-79, or 80-89 years, 
although Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested stratification. There was a significant 
relationship between duration of ambulation and pre- and postoperative AIS 
(p=.0342, p=.0358, respectively) and postoperative KPS (p=.0221). Tokuhashi 
score was not significantly related to duration of survival or ambulation, and 
greatly underestimated life expectancy in 22 of 37 (59%) patients with scores 
0-11.
CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive surgery led to marked improvement in neurological 
function and performance status. More than 50% of patients survived for >1 year, 
some for 3 years or more after surgery.

BACKGROUND Overall, life expectancy at the age of 80 has significantly increased 
in the industrialized world and the proportion of this age class undergoing 
cardiac surgery has also grown. In this context, we have analyzed a contemporary 
series of octogenarians undergoing mitral valve surgery at our institution. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 138 consecutive 
octogenarians receiving mitral valve surgery between January 2006 and April 
2017. Preoperative comorbidities, early mortality, postoperative clinical 
course, and predictors of mortality were examined. RESULTS The mean age was 
82.4±2.0 years and 50% (n=69) were male. Preoperative comorbidities included 
history of heart infarction (24.6%, n=34), chronic renal failure (37.7%, n=52), 
and COPD (27.5%, n=38). A total of 52.9% (n=73) had a history of previous 
cardiac decompensation, while 20 (14.5%) presented with cardiogenic shock or 
cardiac arrest. In all, 33 patients (23.9%) underwent emergency surgery. There 
were only 39 isolated mitral valve procedures, while 99 patients (71.7%) 
underwent various concomitant procedures. The intensive care unit average length 
of stay was 5.3±7.5 days. Respiratory complications and sepsis were the most 
frequent postoperative complications. Emergency surgery and concomitant coronary 
artery bypass grafting were the most important predictors of early mortality. 
The overall 30-day mortality was 18.1% (n=25). The mean follow-up time was 
1.7±2.3 years. CONCLUSIONS Octogenarians are increasingly represented in cardiac 
surgery and combined procedures. Prudent patient selection is necessary for 
optimizing postoperative outcomes among the elderly. In our seriously ill 
octogenarian cohort, mitral valve surgery was associated with moderate but 
acceptable mid-term survival.

BACKGROUND: New 3-drug regimens have been developed and approved to treat 
multiple myeloma (MM). The absence of direct comparative data and the high cost 
of treatment support the need to assess the relative clinical and economic 
outcomes across all approved regimens.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatments for relapsed and/or 
refractory MM from a U.S. health system perspective.
METHODS: We developed a partition survival model with 3 health states 
(progression-free, progression, and death) to evaluate the following regimens: 
carfilzomib (CFZ), elotuzumab (ELO), ixazomib (IX), daratumumab (DAR), and 
panobinostat (PAN) in combination with lenalidomide (LEN) or bortezomib (BOR) 
plus dexamethasone (DEX) in the second and/or third line of therapy. To estimate 
relative treatment effects, we developed a network meta-analysis and applied 
progression-free survival hazard ratios to baseline parametric progression-free 
survival functions derived from pooled data on LEN+DEX. We estimated overall 
survival using data on the relationship between progression-free survival and 
overall survival from a large meta-analysis of MM patients. Modeled costs 
included those related to drug treatment, administration, monitoring, adverse 
events, and progression. Utilities were from publicly available data and 
manufacturer data, if published sources were unavailable.
RESULTS: Model results showed that regimens containing DAR yielded the highest 
expected life years (DAR range: 6.71-7.38 vs. non-DAR range: 3.25-5.27) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY; DAR range: 4.38-5.44 vs. non-DAR range: 
2.04-3.46), with DAR+BOR+DEX (second line) and PAN+BOR+DEX (third line) as the 
most cost-effective options (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $50,700 and 
cost saving, respectively). The applicability of the PAN+BOR+DEX result may be 
challenging, however, because of ongoing toxicity concerns. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, second-line DAR+BOR+DEX and third-line PAN+BOR+DEX had an 
89% and 87% probability of being cost-effective at the $150,000 per QALY 
threshold, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of newer drugs and regimens to treat second- and 
third-line relapsed/refractory MM appears to provide clinical benefits by 
lengthening progression-free and overall survival and improving quality of life. 
However, only the addition of DAR or PAN may be considered cost-effective 
options according to commonly cited thresholds, and PAN+BOR+DEX results require 
cautious interpretation. Achieving levels of value more closely aligned with 
patient benefit would require substantial discounts from the remaining agents 
evaluated.

Despite Gains, the War on HIV Is Far From Over: With No Cure in Sight, Experts 
Urge Early Diagnosis and Prompt Treatment With Better Adherence.

Worley SL.

Although a significant increase in life expectancy for people with human 
immunodeficiency virus was reported last spring, experts in the U.S. caution 
that the results are not a cause for complacency. Efforts to develop a vaccine 
and a cure remain essential, as do efforts to develop interventions that may 
improve adherence.

Toy trains, loaded dice and the origin of life: dimerization on mineral surfaces 
under periodic drive with Gaussian inputs.

In a major extension of previous work, we model the putative hydrothermal rock 
pore setting for the origin of life on Earth as a series of coupled continuous 
flow units (the toy train). Perfusing through this train are reactants that set 
up thermochemical and pH oscillations, and an activated nucleotide that produces 
monomer and dimer monophosphates. The dynamical equations that model this system 
are thermally self-consistent. In an innovative step that breaks some new 
ground, we build stochasticity of the inputs into the model. The computational 
results infer various constraints and conditions on, and insights into, chemical 
evolution and the origin of life and its physical setting: long, interconnected 
porous structures with longitudinal non-uniformity would have been favourable, 
and the ubiquitous pH dependences of biology may have been established in the 
prebiotic era. We demonstrate the important role of Gaussian fluctuations of the 
inputs in driving polymerization, evolution and diversification. In particular, 
we find that the probability distribution of the resulting output fluctuations 
is left-skewed and right-weighted (the loaded dice), which could favour chemical 
evolution towards a living RNA world. We tentatively name this distribution 
'Goldilocks'. These results also vindicate the general approach of constructing 
and running a simple model to learn important new information about a complex 
system.

The limited application of stem cells in medicine: a review.

Poulos J(1).

Author information:

The history of stem cell therapies is one of a limited number of clinical 
applications despite a vast therapeutic potential. Major breakthroughs in stem 
cell research have not yet enjoyed clinical success-all stem cell therapies bar 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantations remain experimental. With the increased 
risk of organ failure and neurodegenerative disease associated with our ability 
to push the boundaries of life expectancy comes an increased pressure to pioneer 
novel stem cell-based therapeutic approaches. We conclude that the failure of 
such therapies to achieve clinical translation stems from the polarising effect 
of the ethical debate around their use. The intractability of the ethical debate 
is double edged: legislators not only have placed tighter restrictions on 
certain stem cell therapies, but do so in favour of less controversial cells 
which will have worse outcomes for patients. It is by considering this 
relationship between the politics, ethics and science of stem cells that the 
reasons for the currently limited clinical significance of stem cell therapies 
be realised.

BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduce sudden cardiac death and all-cause 
mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 
Current guidelines do not suggest any upper age limit for ICD and CRT but 
recommend avoidance of ICD and CRT in frail patients with a life expectancy of 
less than 1 year. It remains unclear whether elderly patients undergoing CRT 
derive the same additional benefit from ICDs as younger patients. We aimed to 
assess the use of ICDs in elderly compared to younger patients receiving CRT.
METHODS: We searched electronic databases, up to April 11, 2016, for all studies 
reporting on ICD use stratified by age in patients who received CRT. We used 
random-effects meta-analysis models to calculate the summarized baseline 
characteristics and rates of implantation of ICD among patients enrolled in the 
studies.
RESULTS: We retained six observational studies enrolling 613 patients ≥75 years 
old and 2810 patients <75 years old. The aggregate mean age was 82.7 years for 
the elderly patients compared to 66.3 years in the younger patients. There was a 
significantly lower use of ICDs in elderly patients compared to that in younger 
patients (37.9% versus 64.3%) (odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence intervals: 
0.14-0.46; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, ICD was less frequently used in patients ≥75 years 
old receiving CRT compared to younger patients receiving CRT. Future studies 
that evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of ICDs in elderly patients with 
indications for CRT are needed to guide management of this increasing 
population.

OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating diseases in the United 
Arab Emirates. Oral antipsychotics (OA) are commonly used in terms of 
pharmacotherapy; however, these treatments can be rendered ineffective by poor 
patient adherence. Paliperidone palmitate once monthly (PP1M) is a long acting 
antipsychotic which can offer an adherence advantage when compared to oral 
treatments. The study objective is to estimate the cost effectiveness of PP1M in 
the UAE setting.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 1-year validated decision-tree model was adapted 
to the UAE setting using published literature and expert opinion. Patients on 
PP1M were compared with or without oral supplementation to patients on any oral 
antipsychotic. Patient outcomes studied were incremental cost per quality 
adjusted life years gained, incremental cost per hospitalizations, relapses, and 
emergency room visits averted.
RESULTS: After 1 year, patients on PP1M monotherapy when compared to oral 
antipsychotics had better outcomes (0.840 vs 0.811 QALYs; 31 relapse days 
averted as well as 9 and 24 percentage points of ER and hospitalizations 
averted, respectively), and better healthcare savings (AED 1405). PP1M 
economically dominated oral antipsychotics. The results were stable across a 
broad range of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. PP1M plus 
oral antipsychotics could not be evaluated due to the absence of clinical data 
that would provide insight into the clinical value of combination therapy.
CONCLUSION: PP1M is estimated to save the UAE healthcare system money, while at 
the same time improving patient outcomes.

Tackling Health Disparities for People Who Are Homeless? Start with Social 
Determinants.

BACKGROUND: Homelessness is associated with enormous health inequalities, 
including shorter life expectancy, higher morbidity and greater usage of acute 
hospital services. Viewed through the lens of social determinants, homelessness 
is a key driver of poor health, but homelessness itself results from accumulated 
adverse social and economic conditions. Indeed, in people who are homeless, the 
social determinants of homelessness and health inequities are often intertwined, 
and long term homelessness further exacerbates poor health. Aggregated health 
service data can mask this, and case histories thus provide important insights.
METHODS: This paper presents three case histories of homeless patients seen at 
an inner city public hospital in Perth, Western Australia. The case histories 
draw on several data sources: hospital data, information collected from rough 
sleepers and clinical observations. Estimates of the cost to the health system 
of the observed hospital usage by the three patients are included.
FINDINGS: The case histories illustrate the interplay of social determinants of 
health in homelessness that help explain the high level of hospital usage by 
rough sleepers. The cumulative healthcare costs for the three individuals over a 
33 months period were substantial. Hospital attendance plummeted even in the 
short term when housing needs were addressed.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating homelessness as a combined health and social issue is 
critical to improving the abysmal health outcomes of people experiencing 
homelessness. In addition, the enormous economic costs of hospital care for 
people who are homeless can be reduced when housing and other social 
determinants are taken into account.

The growth of the post-retirement population, which has occurred as a result of 
rapid growth in life expectancy coupled with the ageing of the baby boomer 
cohort, has led to significant concern. This concern, however, typically 
neglects the heterogeneity of later life experiences and how these are patterned 
by inequalities that reflect how process of social stratification continue to 
operate into later life. This paper draws on a programme of work, based on 
analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, to empirically examine 
questions of inequality in later life. It begins by illustrating the patterning 
of health inequality. It then investigates the importance of later life contexts 
and events in shaping inequality through and after the retirement process. In 
doing so it examines the extent to which later life continues to reflect stable 
social structures that shape inequalities and, consequently, health and 
wellbeing in later life. The paper then illustrates how the effects of 
socioeconomic position on health in later life can be theorised as a product of 
class processes, borrowing in part from Bourdieu. Other dimensions of 
inequality, such as gender, ethnicity, area and sexuality, are not discussed 
here. The paper concludes with a discussion of the need for a close focus on 
inequalities in later life in research, policy and practice.

Cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), is 
related to functional capacity and human performance and has been shown to be a 
strong and independent predictor of all-cause and disease-specific mortality. 
The purpose of this review is to emphasize age-related physiological adaptations 
occurring with regular exercise training, with specific reference to the main 
organs (lung, heart, skeletal muscles) involved in oxygen delivery and 
utilization as well as the importance of exercise training for promoting life 
expectancy in clinically referred populations. As yet, it is not possible to 
extend the genetically fixed lifespan with regular exercise training, but to 
give the years more life. This is where physical fitness plays an important 
role.

BACKGROUND: Our previously published CUDA-only application PaSWAS for 
Smith-Waterman (SW) sequence alignment of any type of sequence on NVIDIA-based 
GPUs is platform-specific and therefore adopted less than could be. The OpenCL 
language is supported more widely and allows use on a variety of hardware 
platforms. Moreover, there is a need to promote the adoption of parallel 
computing in bioinformatics by making its use and extension more simple through 
more and better application of high-level languages commonly used in 
bioinformatics, such as Python.
RESULTS: The novel application pyPaSWAS presents the parallel SW sequence 
alignment code fully packed in Python. It is a generic SW implementation running 
on several hardware platforms with multi-core systems and/or GPUs that provides 
accurate sequence alignments that also can be inspected for alignment details. 
Additionally, pyPaSWAS support the affine gap penalty. Python libraries are used 
for automated system configuration, I/O and logging. This way, the Python 
environment will stimulate further extension and use of pyPaSWAS.
CONCLUSIONS: pyPaSWAS presents an easy Python-based environment for accurate and 
retrievable parallel SW sequence alignments on GPUs and multi-core systems. The 
strategy of integrating Python with high-performance parallel compute languages 
to create a developer- and user-friendly environment should be considered for 
other computationally intensive bioinformatics algorithms.

retirement.

BACKGROUND: To assess the contribution of disability retirement on lost working 
years, we calculated the length of time spent on disability pension in various 
diagnostic groups by the level of education over the past 10 years, during which 
time the incidence of disability retirement has sharply decreased in Finland.
METHODS: The expectancy for time on disability pension due to mental disorders, 
musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and other diseases at age 
groups 25-63 was calculated using the Sullivan method based on nationwide 
register data for 2005-2014. The effect of the rise in overall education levels 
was estimated using counterfactual analysis.
RESULTS: Time spent on disability pension differed widely between educational 
groups. People in lower educational groups spent more time on disability pension 
due to all diagnoses and musculoskeletal diseases in particular. Time spent on 
disability pension decreased in all educational groups over time. In 2014, 
primary educated men were expected to spend 2.67 years on disability pension, 
compared to 0.57 years for higher tertiary educated men. The figures for women 
were closely similar. Educational differences in time spent on disability 
pension due to somatic diseases decreased over time, whereas the opposite was 
true for mental disorders. The reduced amount of time spent on disability 
pension was explained in part by the rise in overall education levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Time spent on disability pension due to somatic conditions has 
decreased in all educational groups. Educational differences in time spent on 
disability pension are increasingly attributable to mental disorders.

Sec2 activates Sec4 Rab GTPase as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the 
recruitment of downstream effectors to facilitate tethering and fusion of 
post-Golgi vesicles at the plasma membrane. During the meiosis and sporulation 
of budding yeast, post-Golgi vesicles are transported to and fused at the 
spindle pole body (SPB) to form a de novo membrane, called the prospore 
membrane. Previous studies have revealed the role of the SPB outer surface 
called the meiotic outer plaque (MOP) in docking and fusion of post-Golgi 
vesicles. However, the upstream molecular machinery for post-Golgi vesicular 
fusion that facilitates prospore membrane formation remains enigmatic. Here, we 
demonstrate that the GTP exchange factor for Sec4, Sec2, participates in the 
formation of the prospore membrane. A conditional mutant in which the SEC2 
expression is shut off during sporulation showed sporulation defects. 
Inactivation of Sec2 caused Sec4 targeting defects along the prospore membranes, 
thereby causing insufficient targeting of downstream effectors and cargo 
proteins to the prospore membrane. These results suggest that the activation of 
Sec4 by Sec2 is required for the efficient supply of post-Golgi vesicles to the 
prospore membrane and thus for prospore membrane formation/extension and 
subsequent deposition of spore wall materials.

Objective: To determine the most cost-effective modality for breast cancer 
screening in women living in Shanghai. Methods: A Markov model for breast cancer 
was redeveloped based on true effect which was derived from a project for 
detection of women at high risk of breast cancer and an organized breast cancer 
screening program conducted simultaneously in Minhang district, Shanghai, during 
2008 to 2012. Parameters of the model were derived from literatures. General 
principles related to cost-effectiveness analysis were used to compare the costs 
and effects of 12 different screening modalities in a simulated cohort involving 
100 000 women aged 45 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
used to determine the most cost-effective modality. Sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to evaluate how these factors affected the estimated 
cost-effectiveness. Results: The modality of biennial CBE followed by ultrasonic 
and mammography among those with positive CBE was observed as the most 
cost-effective one. The costs appeared as 182 526 Yuan RMB per life year gained 
and 144 386 Yuan RMB per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, which were 
within the threshold of 2-3 times of local per capita Gross Domestic Product. 
Results from sensitivity analysis showed that, due to higher incidence rate of 
breast cancer in Shanghai, the cost per QALY would be 64 836 Yuan RMB lower in 
Shanghai than the average level in China. Conclusion: Our research findings 
showed that the biennial CBE program followed by ultrasonic and mammography for 
those with positive CBE results might serve as the optimal breast cancer 
screening modality for Chinese women living in Shanghai, and thus be widely 
promoted in this population elsewhere.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the inequalities in life expectancy in the Spanish 
population over the age of 65 according to educational level.
METHOD: Cross sectional study on the Spanish population aged 65 years and over. 
Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were calculated combining mortality, 
health and population data.
RESULTS: People aged 65 and over with a lower educational level had shorter 
lives, with fewer years of good health and more years of poor health. Women 
lived longer, but with proportionally more years of poor health.
DISCUSSION: Social inequalities in health must be considered in the current 
debate on delaying the age of retirement.

BACKGROUND: Diabetics have increased risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
mortality, reducing their life expectancy by up to 15 years. Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus specifically increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality nearly 
fivefold. When hypertension is combined with diabetes, the risk of CVD is even 
greater.
OBJECTIVE: Identify non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes and renal function 
impairment in a cohort of hypertensive patients in regular treatment in a 
reference treatment center, over 11 years of follow-up.
METHODS: Historical cohort of hypertensive patients in regular treatment for at 
least 11 years in a specialized service for hypertension treatment. The exposed
