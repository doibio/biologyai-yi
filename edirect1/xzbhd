(CF). It is aimed at patients with the G551D (glycine to aspartate change in 
nucleotide 1784 in exon 11) mutation; 5.7% of patients with CF in the UK have 
this mutation.
OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in patients aged ≥ 6 years who have the G551D 
mutation.
METHODS: Ten databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched from 
inception to July 2012. Studies that evaluated ivacaftor for the treatment of 
adults and children (≥ 6 years) with at least one G551D mutation were eligible. 
There were insufficient data to conduct a formal meta-analysis. The manufacturer 
of ivacaftor, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted a deterministic patient-level 
simulation model for the assessment of the lifetime cost-effectiveness of 
ivacaftor. We modified the model where values were not UK-specific or not 
recent, or where better estimates could be found. The only change to the model 
structure was the addition of lung transplantations. We changed utility values, 
annual decline in percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1), and the baseline exacerbation rate, and used data from the CF Registry 
to estimate the relation between costs, age and percentage predicted FEV1. 
Estimates of treatment effect of ivacaftor came from the clinical effectiveness 
review. We modelled three scenarios for the longer-term effects of ivacaftor. We 
also modelled an 'optimistic' scenario for patients aged < 12 years with little 
lung damage. We conducted a budget impact analysis to estimate the total cost to 
the NHS of introducing ivacaftor in England.
RESULTS: Three studies were included: a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 
adults (n = 167) (≥ 12 years), a RCT in children (n = 26) (6-11 years), and an 
open-label extension study of the two RCTs. Both RCTs reported significantly 
greater changes from baseline in all measures of lung function in patients 
receiving ivacaftor than in those receiving placebo. The mean difference in 
change in percentage predicted FEV1 was 10.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.5 
to 12.5] percentage points in the adults' study and 10.0 (95% CI 4.5 to 15.5) 
percentage points in the children's study at 48 weeks. Improvements in lung 
function were seen across all subgroups investigated (age, sex, study region and 
lung function). There were significantly greater improvements in the ivacaftor 
group than in the placebo group for all outcomes assessed (exacerbations, 
quality of life, sweat chloride and weight) with the exception of quality of 
life in children. Improvements were maintained in the open-label trial. Adverse 
events were mainly minor and comparable across treatment groups. Both RCTs 
reported more withdrawals in the placebo group than in the ivacaftor group. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied between £335,000 and £1,274,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. The total additional lifetime costs for all 
eligible CF patients in England ranged from £438M to £479M; the lifetime cost 
for standard care only was £72M.
CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that ivacaftor is a clinically 
effective treatment for patients with CF and the G551D mutation; the high cost 
of ivacaftor may prove an obstacle in the uptake of this treatment. The main 
priority for further research is the long-term effectiveness of ivacaftor.

PURPOSE: Hyperkalemia during renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition 
(RAAS-I) may prevent optimum dosing. Treatment options include sodium 
polystyrene sulfonate potassium binding resins, but safety and efficacy concerns 
exist, including associated colonic necrosis (CN). Alternative agents have been 
studied, but cost-utility has not been estimated.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis of outpatients ≥ 18 years of age 
receiving chronic RAAS-I, with a history of hyperkalemia or chronic kidney 
disease, prescribed either sodium polystyrene sulfonate or a theoretical "drug 
X" binding resin for chronic hyperkalemia. Data were obtained from existing 
literature. We used a decision analytic model with Monte Carlo probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, from a health care payer perspective and a 12-month time 
horizon. Costs were measured in US dollars. Effectiveness was measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs).
RESULTS: Drug X could cost no more than $ 10.77 per daily dose to be 
cost-effective, at a willingness-to- pay (WTP) threshold of $ 50,000/QALY. At $ 
40.00 per daily dose, drug X achieved an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 
$26,088,369.00 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed sodium 
polystyrene sulfonate to be the cost-effective option for CN incidences ≤ 19.9%. 
Limitations include incomplete information on outpatient outcomes and lack of 
data directly comparing sodium polystyrene sulfonate to potential alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Alternatives may not be cost-effective unless priced similarly to 
sodium polystyrene sulfonate. This analysis may guide decisions regarding 
adoption of alternative agents for chronic hyperkalemia control, and suggests 
that sodium polystyrene sulfonate be employed as an active control in clinical 
trials of these agents.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with 
marginal life expectancy. Based on the assumption that GBM cells gain functions 
not necessarily involved in the cancerous process, patient-derived glioblastoma 
cells (GCs) were screened to identify cellular processes amenable for 
development of targeted treatments. The quinine-derivative NSC13316 reliably and 
selectively compromised viability. Synthetic chemical expansion reveals delicate 
structure-activity relationship and analogs with increased potency, termed 
Vacquinols. Vacquinols stimulate death by membrane ruffling, cell rounding, 
massive macropinocytic vacuole accumulation, ATP depletion, and cytoplasmic 
membrane rupture of GCs. The MAP kinase MKK4, identified by a shRNA screen, 
represents a critical signaling node. Vacquinol-1 displays excellent in vivo 
pharmacokinetics and brain exposure, attenuates disease progression, and 
prolongs survival in a GBM animal model. These results identify a vulnerability 
to massive vacuolization that can be targeted by small molecules and point to 
the possible exploitation of this process in the design of anticancer therapies.

BACKGROUND: Aicardi syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterized by the triad of corpus callosum agenesis, chorioretinal lacunae, 
and infantile spasms. Most patients with AS also have intractable epilepsy, 
moderate to severe learning disability, and a reduced life expectancy. An 
X-linked dominant inheritance caused by de novo mutations pattern, lethal in 
males, is postulated, but the gene has not yet been isolated. There are three 
case reports of 47 XXY males with classic features of AS who all had severe 
developmental disability.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 3.5-year old 47 XXY male with the classic 
triad of Aicardi syndrome but with good seizure control and mild learning 
disability.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) or 
secondary prophylaxis (SP) with pegfilgrastim, filgrastim (6-day and 11-day), or 
no prophylaxis to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with 
recurrent ovarian cancer receiving docetaxel or topotecan.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PP vs SP 
from a US payer perspective. Model inputs, including the efficacy of each 
strategy (relative risk of FN with prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis) and 
mortality, costs, and utility values were estimated from public sources and 
peer-reviewed publications. Incremental cost-effectiveness was evaluated in 
terms of net cost per FN event avoided, incremental cost per life-year saved 
(LYS), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a 
lifetime horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and 
PSA) were conducted.
RESULTS: For patients receiving docetaxel, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) for PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim was $7900 per QALY gained, and PP 
with pegfilgrastim dominated all other comparators. For patients receiving 
topotecan, PP with pegfilgrastim dominated all comparators. Model results were 
most sensitive to baseline FN risk. PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim was cost 
effective in 68% and 83% of simulations for docetaxel and in >99% of simulations 
for topotecan at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: PP with pegfilgrastim should be considered cost effective compared 
to other prophylaxis strategies in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer 
receiving docetaxel or topotecan with a high risk of FN.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the net impact on U.S. longevity of the decision to commute 
by bicycle rather than automobile.
METHODS: We construct fatality rates per distance traveled using official 
statistics and denominators from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. We 
model the life-table impact of switching from auto to bicycle commuting. Key 
factors are increased risks from road accidents and reduced risks from enhanced 
cardiovascular health.
RESULTS: Bicycling fatality rates in the U.S. are an order of magnitude higher 
than in Western Europe. Risks punish both young and old, while the health 
benefits guard against causes of mortality that rise rapidly with age. Although 
the protective effects of bicycling appear significant, it may be optimal to 
wait until later ages to initiate regular bicycle commuting in the current U.S. 
risk environment, especially if individuals discount future life years.
CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime health benefits of bicycle commuting appear to 
outweigh the risks in the U.S., but individuals who sufficiently discount or 
disbelieve the health benefits may delay or avoid bicycling. Bicycling in middle 
age avoids much fatality risk while capturing health benefits. Significant 
cross-state variations in bicycling mortality suggest that improvements in the 
built environment might spur changes in transit mode.

Small GTPases, RacA and Cdc42, act as molecular switches in fungi, regulating 
cell signaling, cytoskeletal organization, polar growth and reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) generation, the latter by influencing the activity of the NADPH 
oxidase complex. In this study, the racA and cdc42 genes from Nomuraea rileyi 
were cloned and shown to encode 218 and 184 amino acid proteins, respectively. 
To determine the functions of racA and cdc42, gene-silencing mutants (racARM, 
cdc42RM and racA&cdc42RM, respectively) were generated using RNA silencing 
technology. In racARM and cdc42RM, the conidial and microsclerotium (MS) yields, 
ROS production and virulence were reduced, the hyphal extension rate was 
decreased and the dimorphic switch was delayed. On the other hand, the 
double-silencing mutants showed growth retardation and virtually no conidia, MS 
or ROS production. The transcription levels of the noxA and noxR genes that 
regulate ROS generation were reduced in the three RNAi-silenced strains. 
Interestingly, when compared with the controls, racARM exhibited thicker hyphae 
and bigger conidia; moreover, the MS produced by racARM were bigger than those 
of the control and smaller than those of cdc42RM. Thus RacA and Cdc42 appear to 
share some essential functions in N. rileyi, including hyphal growth, 
conidiation, MS formation, ROS generation and virulence. Yet RacA appears to 
play a more pivotal role in the polar growth of N. rileyi.

Lymphoma and leukemia represent a serious threat to human health and life 
expectancy. Resveratrol is, among the natural-derived chemopreventive molecules, 
one of the most effective and better studied. In this paper the main mechanisms 
of cell death triggered by- or linked to- resveratrol are reviewed and 
discussed. The main focus is on lymphoma and leukemia experimental models where 
resveratrol has been tested and investigated at the cellular, molecular or 
physiological levels. The most relevant in vivo challenges involving resveratrol 
are also reported and analyzed in order to define the key features of this 
polyphenol and the potential for the treatment of hematologic tumors.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) form a superfamily defined by their ability to 
catalyze the conjugation of glutathione with electrophilic substrates. These 
enzymes are proposed to play a critical role in protection of cellular 
components from damage mediated by reactive metabolites. Twenty-two cytosolic 
GSTs, grouped into seven families, are recognized in mice. This complexity 
hinders the assignment of function to a subset or family of these genes. We 
report generation of a mouse line in which the locus encoding three GST gene 
families is deleted. This includes the four Gstt genes spanning 65 kb on 
chromosome 10 and the seven Gstm genes found on a 150 kb segment of DNA 
chromosome 3. In addition, we delete two Gstp genes on chromosome 19 as well as 
a third related gene located 15 kb telomeric to Gstp1 and Gstp2, which we 
identify as a potential new member of this gene family. We show that, despite 
the loss of up to 75% of total GST activity in some tissues from these animals, 
the mice are healthy and fertile, with normal life expectancy. The normal 
development and health of these animals make them an appropriate model for 
defining the role of these families in redox homeostasis and metabolism of drugs 
and environmental pollutants.

Transforming EQ-5D utilities for use in cost–value analysis of health programs.

Nord E, Johansen R.

In a number of jurisdictions there is increasing interest in incorporating 
concerns for fairness in models for economic evaluation of health interventions. 
Cost–value analysis is a name for evaluations with such a broader aim. The most 
widely held concern for fairness is a concern for the worse off, i.e. the idea 
that severity of illness should count in determining priorities. In economic 
evaluations of improvements in health-related quality of life this concern may 
be taken into account by replacing conventional health state utilities with 
societal values for health states that are characterised by strong upper end 
compression and decreasing marginal value of utility gains. We review evidence 
on the strength of concerns for the worse off--measured at the cardinal 
level--in 15 articles published in peer-reviewed journals in the time period 
1978–2010, with reports from altogether 20 individual studies in nine different 
countries. We report 116 individual observations of paired comparisons of 
utility improvements with different start levels. Concerns for severity show up 
quite strongly across countries, sample types and question framings. By means of 
regression analyses we fit a societal value function to the data that has the 
property of decreasing marginal value of utility gains. Using the central 
tendency in the data we present two plausible transformations of EQ-5D utilities 
into societal values that reflect concerns for the worse off.

Inappropriate prescribing in patients accessing specialist palliative day care 
services.

Todd A, Nazar H, Pearson H, Andrew L, Baker L, Husband A.

BACKGROUND: For patients accessing specialist palliative care day services, 
medication is prescribed routinely to manage acute symptoms, treat long-term 
conditions or prevent adverse events associated with these conditions. As such, 
the pharmacotherapeutic burden for these patients is high and polypharmacy is 
common. Consequently, the risk of these patients developing drug-related 
toxicities through drug–drug interactions is exacerbated. Medication use in this 
group should, therefore, be evaluated regularly to align with achievable 
therapeutic outcomes considering remaining life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To (1) assess the prevalence of inappropriate medication use; (2) 
identify potential drug–drug interactions; and, (3) determine how many potential 
drug– drug interactions could be prevented by discontinuing inappropriate 
medication.
SETTING: A specialist tertiary care palliative care centre in Northern England 
serving a population of 330,000.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prescribing of inappropriate medication.
METHOD: Medication histories for patients accessing a specialist palliative day 
care centre were established and a modified Delphi method was used to reach 
consensus of medication appropriateness. The Delphi method utilized a framework 
considering the following factors: remaining life expectancy of the patient, 
time until benefit of the treatment, goals of care and treatment targets. 
Potential drug interactions were established using drug interaction recognition 
software and categorised by their ability to cause harm.
RESULTS: A total number of 132 patients were assessed during the study period 
who were prescribed 1,532 (mean = 12/patient) medications; 238 (16 %) were 
considered inappropriate in the context of limited life expectancy. The most 
common class of medications considered inappropriate were the statins, observed 
in 35 (27 %) patients. A total of 267 potential drug–drug interactions were 
identified; 112 were clinically significant and 155 were not considered 
clinically significant. Discontinuation of inappropriate medication would reduce 
the total number of medications taken to 1,294 (mean = 10/patient) and prevent 
31 clinically significant potential drug–drug interactions.
CONCLUSION: Patients accessing specialist palliative day care services take many 
inappropriate medications. These medications not only increase the 
pharmacotherapeutic burden for the patient but they also contribute to potential 
drug–drug interactions. These patients should have their medication reviewed in 
the context of life limiting illness aligned with achievable therapeutic 
outcomes.

Listening to the voices of native Hawaiian elders and ‘ohana caregivers: 
discussions on aging, health, and care preferences.

Browne CV, Mokuau N, Ka'opua LS, Kim BJ, Higuchi P, Braun KL.

Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawai’i, are affected by varying 
social and health disparities that result in high prevalence of chronic disease, 
early onset of disability, and shorter life expectancy compared to other ethnic 
groups in Hawai’i. Six listening meetings were conducted, involving 41 
community-dwelling kūpuna (Native Hawaiian elders) and ‘ohana (family) 
caregivers to investigate health and care preferences that offer the potential 
for improving well-being in later life for Native Hawaiian elders. As 
background, we provide three explanatory perspectives and theories—life course 
perspective, minority stress theory, and historical trauma—that guided the 
design of this study and provided the study’s context. A number of overarching 
themes and subthemes were identified, some of which point to universal concerns 
with age and caregiving (such as challenges and costs associated with growing 
old and caregiving) and others that are culturally specific (such as influence 
of culture and social stressors, including discrimination, on health needs and 
care preferences). Results give further support to the urgency of affordable,

The number of patients with end-stage renal disease has steadily increased and 
improvements in hemodialysis techniques have lead to extended life expectancy. 
Pseudoaneurysm is a relatively rare complication of autogenous vascular access. 
We have reported a case in which an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm developed in a 
patient on hemodialysis treatment.

Short-, Intermediate-, and Long-term Quality of Life Outcomes Following Radical 
Prostatectomy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.

Many clinically localized prostate cancers that are diagnosed today are low 
risk, and prevention of disease-specific mortality may only be realized decades 
after treatment. Radical prostatectomy (RP) may adversely impact health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) by causing both transient or permanent urinary 
incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In contrast, RP may also improve HRQOL 
via relief of lower urinary tract symptoms in men suffering from these symptoms 
prior to surgery. Because the average man treated for prostate cancer has a life 
expectancy of approximately 14 years, it is imperative to consider the long-term 
impact of RP on both survival and HRQOL in treatment decision making. This 
comprehensive literature review examines short-, intermediate-, and long-term 
HRQOL following RP. In addition, the long-term results of RP are compared with 
other treatment modalities for treating clinically localized prostate cancer.

[Overall logarithmic index for the characterization of adaptation and regulatory 
systems straining under chronic action of extreme environmental factors].

[Article in Russian]

Shafirkin AV, Vasin AL, Shtemberg AS.

The article advertizes some optional capabilities of the overall logarithmic 
index as an integral parameter for quantifying adaptation processes triggered by 
chronic exposure to stress factors of varying intensity. Consideration is given 
to the principles of damage formation in different systems of organism with time 
and subsequent compensatory processes depending on the level of regulation 
system straining, rate of functional potential depletion, probability of remote 
consequences such as early aging, increased risk of lethality and reduction of 
the mean remaining life expectancy. The overall logarithmic index will be used 
to analyze the transition from normal to active insufficient adaptation, and 
possible adaptation failure because of a drastic decline of organism resistance. 
In fact, an attempt was made to use the index to quantify adaptation cost, loss 
of resistance, and possible increase of the risk of remote consequences.

Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: reframing inequities experienced by 
people with severe mental illness.

Whitley R(1), Henwood BF(2).

Author information:
(1)Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University.
(2)School of Social Work, University of Southern California.

TOPIC: In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson stated that citizens 
of the new republic had fundamental and inalienable rights to "life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness."
PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to reframe inequities experienced by 
people living with severe mental illnesses in terms of violations of 
Jeffersonian rights to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." We 
simultaneously consider governmental and clinical efforts to address identified 
inequities and uphold these rights.
SOURCES USED: The broad research literature on severe mental illnesses was 
examined.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: People with severe mental illnesses 
experience numerous inequities regarding "life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness." These inequities include diminished life expectancy, excessive 
involuntary commitment and elevated rates of unemployment and homelessness. 
Governmental and clinical responses to such inequities include the Affordable 
Care Act and the Olmstead Decision, as well as recovery-oriented interventions 
such as Supported Employment and Supported Housing.

Sydney, NSW, Australia; Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, 
University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic., Australia; Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

AIMS: To estimate the prevalence and burden of disease attributable to opioid 
dependence globally, regionally and at country level.
METHODS: Multiple search strategies: (i) peer-reviewed literature searches; (ii) 
systematic searches of online databases; (iii) internet searches; (iv) 
consultation and feedback from experts. Culling and data extraction followed 
protocols. DisMod-MR, the latest version of the generic disease modelling 
system, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, imputed prevalence by age, year and sex 
for 187 countries and 21 regions. Disability weight for opioid dependence was 
estimated through population surveys and multiplied by prevalence data to 
calculate the years of life lived with disability (YLDs). Opioid dependence 
premature mortality was computed as years of life lost (YLLs) and summed with 
YLDs to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: There were 15.5 million opioid-dependent people globally in 2010 
[0.22%, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) = 0.20-0.25%]. Age-standardized prevalence 
was higher in males (0.30%, 95% UI = 0.27-0.35%) than females (0.14%, 95% 
UI = 0.12-0.16%), and peaked at 25-29 years. Prevalence was higher than the 
global pooled prevalence in Australasia (0.46%, 95% UI = 0.41-0.53%), western 
Europe (0.35%, 95% UI = 0.32-0.39) and North America (0.30%, 95% 
UI = 0.25-0.36). Opioid dependence was estimated to account for 9.2 million 
DALYs globally (0.37% of global DALYs) in 2010, a 73% increase on DALYs 
estimated in 1990. Regions with the highest opioid dependence DALY rates were 
North America (292.1 per 100,000), eastern Europe (288.4 per 100,000), 
Australasia (278.6 per 100,000) and southern sub-Saharan Africa (263.5 per 
100,000). The contribution of YLLs to opioid dependence burden was particularly 
high in North America, eastern Europe and southern sub-Saharan Africa.
CONCLUSION: Opioid dependence is a substantial contributor to the global disease 
burden; its contribution to premature mortality (relative to prevalence) varies 
geographically, with North America, eastern Europe and southern sub-Saharan 
Africa most strongly affected.

Changes in the oral-health-related quality of life of Brazilian children after 
an educational preventive programme: an 1-month longitudinal evaluation.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Piracicaba Dental School, University of 
Campinas, Piracicaba, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: This 1-month longitudinal study assessed whether the oral status and 
the oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children changed after four 
sessions of an educational preventive programme.
STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS: Fifty Brazilian students (11-12 year old) were 
examined for signs and symptoms of gingivitis using the Community Periodontal 
Index and two questions about gingival bleeding. The OHRQoL was measured using 
the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Child Oral Impacts on Daily Performances 
(Child-OIDP). Higher scores indicated worse OHRQoL. The results were analysed 
using the Shapiro-Wilk, Chi-square, Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney tests. 
The magnitude of the mean change was calculated using the effect size.
RESULTS: Twenty-four percentage of children had more than six sites with 
bleeding at follow-up compared with 58% at baseline. There was a significant 
decline in the intensity and extension of impacts at follow-up. A significant 
improvement in the clinical status and oral hygiene was observed for both 
transitional categories. There was a significant decline in the Child-OIDP 
scores of those reporting 'much improved'. A significant improvement in the 
global ratings of oral health was observed at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In the studied sample, an improvement occurred with respect to the 
severity of disease, intensity and extension of impacts and global ratings of 
oral health after 1-month follow-up. These results suggest that improving the 
global transition in health by enhancing coping and management skills while 
inducing slight changes in the clinical status and the specific aspects of 
health compromised by the disease is possible.

OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer (BC) in the elderly population is by far the most 
frequent malignancy in Western countries; however, little evidence is available 
regarding the specific management of this group. The purpose of this study was 
to identify how the biological and clinical characteristics of cancer have 
changed over the past 20years by comparing two groups of elderly patients with 
breast cancer operated on 20years apart. The secondary endpoint was to underline 
potential changes in surgical strategy over the past 20years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One group of consecutive elderly patients undergoing 
surgery for BC between January 1990 and December 1993 (Group A), and one group 
undergoing surgery between January 2008 and December 2011 (Group B) were 
identified and analyzed. Data regarding surgical treatment, stage, tumor 
grading, hormonal and HER2/neu receptors, and Ki-67 were collected and compared.
RESULTS: A total of 422 elderly patients underwent surgical treatment, 142 in 
Group A and 280 in Group B. An earlier stage at presentation was detected in 
Group B, T1 (57.5% B vs. 31.6% A) and N0 (64.6% B vs. 54.2% A). Surgical 
treatment in the first group was more extensive while conservative procedures 
were more frequently performed in the second group. Despite the earlier 
presentation, tumor grade was higher in Group B (G3 10.6% A vs. 32.1% B, 
p<0.05). Overexpression of Ki-67 was again more frequent in Group B (56.2% B vs. 
32.5% A, p<0.05). Hormonal and HER2/neu receptor expression was comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: Nowadays, elderly patients with BC are more likely to present at an 
early stage; therefore, conservative surgery is a feasible option. Despite 
potential bias related to changes of pathology and immunohistochemistry 
examination techniques over the decades, the biological characteristics of 
recent patients with BC seem to be consistent with more aggressive tumors. 
Tailored treatment should be offered with regard to biological age, the 
cancer-specific profile and active life expectancy.

UK Renal Registry 16th annual report: chapter 8 survival and cause of death of 
UK adult patients on renal replacement therapy in 2012: national and 
centre-specific analyses.

Pruthi R(1), Steenkamp R, Feest T.

Author information:
(1)UK Renal Registry, Bristol, UK.

INTRODUCTION: These analyses examine: a) survival from the start of renal 
replacement therapy (RRT); b) survival amongst all prevalent dialysis patients 
alive on 31st December 2011; c) the cause of death for incident and prevalent 
patients and d) the projected life years remaining for patients starting RRT. 
Changes in survival between the 1997 and 2011 cohort are also reported.
METHODS: Survival was calculated for both incident and prevalent patients on 
RRT. Survival of incident patients (starting RRT during 2011) was calculated 
both from the start of RRT and from 90 days after starting RRT, both with and 
without censoring at transplantation. Prevalent dialysis patients were censored 
at transplantation. Both Kaplan-Meier and Cox adjusted models were used to 
calculate survival. The relative risk of death was calculated and compared with 
the UK general population.
RESULTS: The unadjusted 1 year after 90 day survival for patients starting RRT 
in 2011 was 87.5%, representing an increase from the previous year (87.3%). The 
age-adjusted one year survival (adjusted to age 60) of prevalent dialysis 
patients increased from 88.2% in the 2002 cohort to 89.7% in the 2011 cohort. 
Prevalent diabetic patient one year survival rose from 81.6% in the 2002 cohort 
to 84.9% in the 2011 cohort. The age-standardised mortality ratio for prevalent 
RRT patients compared with the general population was 16.6 for age group 35-39 
and 2.7 at age 85+ years. In the prevalent RRT dialysis population, 
cardiovascular disease accounted for 22% of deaths, infection 17% and treatment 
withdrawal 19%. The median life years remaining for a 25-29 year old on RRT was 
18.5 years and approximately 2.5 for a 75+ year old.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients starting RRT has improved in the 2011 incident 
cohort. The relative risk of death on RRT compared with the general population 
has fallen since 2001.

The Cost Effectiveness of Polyetheretheketone (PEEK) Cages for Anterior Cervical 
Discectomy and Fusion.

New York, NY.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model with inputs from 
published literature.
OBJECTIVE: To learn which graft or hardware option used in a single-level 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is most beneficial in terms of 
cost, quality of life, and overall cost effectiveness. Options studied were 
autograft, allograft, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cages for cervical fusion.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ACDF is commonly used to treat cervical myelopathy 
and/or radiculopathy. No study has compared the cost effectiveness of autograft, 
allograft, and PEEK in 1-level ACDF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review provided inputs into a Markov 
decision model to determine the most effective graft or hardware option for 
1-level ACDF. Data regarding rate of complications, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained, and cost for each procedure type was collected. The Markov model 
was first run in a base case, using all currently available data. The model was 
then tested using 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses to determine the validity 
of the model's conclusions if specific aspects of model were changed. This model 
was run for 10 years postoperatively.
RESULTS: The cost per QALY for each option in the base case analysis was 
$3328/QALY for PEEK, $2492/QALY for autograft, and $2492/QALY for allograft. All 
graft/hardware options are cost effective ways to improve outcomes for patients 
living with chronic neck pain. For graft/hardware options the most 
cost-effective option was allograft. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for PEEK compared with autograft or allograft was >$100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Allograft is the most cost-effective graft/hardware option for 
ACDF. Compared with living with cervical myelopathy and/or radiculopathy, ACDF 
using any graft or hardware option is a cost-effective method of improving the 
quality of life of patients. PEEK is not a cost-effective option compared with 
allograft or autograft for use in ACDF.

The changes in clinical features of multiple sclerosis (MS) are noted worldwide 
which can be explained by diagnosis improvement and DMT implementation. 
Epidemiological studies of 2008-2012 in the North-West Administrative District 
of Moscow noted the higher proportion of women among patients of MS 
(M:F=1:2.61), longer duration of the disease (mean 14.3±10.6 years, maximum - 53 
years) and life expectancy of patients (44.3±12.7 years, the maximum age - 77 
years). The percentage of patients with secondary progressive course of MS 
increased (35%). In addition, MS onset before 16 years old was diagnosed more 
often (5.66% of cases) and late onset MS was identified in 4.04% of the cases. 
Up to 45.9% of MS patients have moderate and expressed disability (group 1 and 2 
disability).

Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: Adherence with bisphosphonates therapy is generally low. Enhancing 
adherence with bisphosphonates would be effective in achieving the full benefits 
of therapy albeit a growth in the expenditure for supporting incremented drug 
use is expected. The cost-effectiveness of enhancing adherence with oral 
bisphosphonates in a large population of osteoporotic women has been assessed in 
the current study.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Healthcare utilisation databases of Lombardy Region, Italy.
PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 28 558 women aged 45 years or more, resident in the 
Italian Region of Lombardy, who were newly treated with oral bisphosphonates 
during 2003-2004, was followed for 6 years after index prescription.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Fracture-free survival time, healthcare cost and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of enhancing adherence, that is, the additional 
cost that would be spent every year for gaining one fracture-free year as a 
consequence of enhancing adherence at a certain level.
RESULTS: Enhanced adherence from 33% (baseline) to 80%, increased both 
fracture-free survivals from 970 to 973 years and healthcare costs from €118 000 
to €265 000 every 1000 woman-years, with ICER value of €53 000 (95% CI €49 000 
to €58 000). ICER values were lower for older women (€50 000; 95% CI €42 000 to 
€58 000) and for those suffering from at least a chronic comorbidity (€25000; 
95% CI 95% CI €7000 to €47 000).
CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing adherence with oral bisphosphonates offers important 
benefits in reducing the risk of fracture, although at a substantial cost.

BACKGROUND: The number of hip and knee arthroplasty procedures is steadily 
increasing as life expectancy increases. Coxiella burnetii may be responsible 
for culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis and is associated with 
antibiotic failure and repeated surgeries. We report the first case series of C. 
burnetii-related culture-negative prosthetic joint arthritis.
METHODS: Cases were retrieved from the French National Referral center for Q 
fever. Diagnosis was based on (18)fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography, serology, broad-range polymerase chain reaction, and C. 
burnetii-specific polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Four cases of C. burnetii-related culture-negative prosthetic joint 
arthritis were found. Standard bacteriologic procedures would have missed the 
diagnosis in all cases. Etiologic diagnosis improved the outcome in all but 1 
case.
CONCLUSIONS: A systematic, comprehensive diagnostic strategy should be used in
