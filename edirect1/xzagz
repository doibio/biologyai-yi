major vascular events of 42% and 12% at start of treatment gained 2.49 and 1.67 
life years, respectively. Treatment with statins remained cost saving or cost 
less than 2500 pounds sterling per life year gained in people as young as 35 
years or as old as 85 with 5 year risks of a major vascular event as low as 5% 
at the start of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with statins is cost effective in a wider population than 
is routinely treated at present.

A significant increase of the elderly in populations of developed countries is 
followed by increase morbidity and mortality from main age-related 
diseases--cardiovascular and neuro-degenerative, cancer, diabetes mellitus, 
declining in a resistance to infections. Obviously, the development of means of 
the prevention of the premature ageing and these diseases in humans are crucial 
at present. However, data on such type means rather scarce, contradictory and 
often not reliable from the points of view of the adequacy of the experiments to 
current scientific requirements, as well as the interpretation of the results 
and safety. Available data on the life span extension and adverse effects of 
chemical compounds and drugs suggested as geroprotectors are critically 
analyzed: antidiabetic drugs, growth and thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, 
DHEA, sex steroids and contraceptives, melatonin and peptide preparations 
modulating the pineal gland, antioxidants, chelate agents and lathyrogens, 
adaptogens and herbs, neurotropic drugs, inhibitors of monoamine oxidase, 
immunomodulators and some other. Most of the results could not convincingly 
evidence the life span extension and safety of the suggested geroprotectors. We 
believe that it is necessary to establish an international program for the 
expert evaluation of the life span extension potential of pharmacological 
interventions for humans. The scope of the program should be to evaluate 
chemical, immunological, dietary and behavioural interventions that may lead to 
life span extension or retard premature ageing and the objective--preparation of 
critical reviews and evaluations on evidence of the life span extending 
properties of a wide range of potential geroprotectors and strategies by 
international groups of working experts. The program may assist national and 
international authorities in devising programs of health promotion and premature 
ageing prevention.

Selegiline inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase B, enhances the release of 
dopamine, blocks the uptake of dopamine, acts as a calmodulin antagonist, and 
enhances the level of cyclic AMP, which in turn protects dopaminergic neurons. 
It possesses cognition-enhancing functions, rejuvenates serum insulin-like 
growth factor I in aged rats, and enhances life expectancy in rodents. 
Selegiline possesses neurotrophic-like actions, and rescues axotomized 
motorneurons independent of monoamine oxidase B inhibition. It enhances the 
synthesis of nerve growth factor, protects dopaminergic neurons from 
glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity, and protects dopaminergic neurons from toxic 
factors present in the spinal fluid of parkinsonian patients, and the said 
effect may be mediated via elaborating brain derived neurotrophic factor. 
Selegiline increases the striatal superoxide dismutase, protects against 
peroxynitrite- and nitric oxide-induced apoptosis, and guards dopaminergic 
neurons from toxicity induced by glutathione depletion. It stimulates the 
biosynthesis of interleukin 1-beta and interleukin-6, is an immunoenhancing 
substance, possesses antiapoptotic actions, and is neuroprotectant in nature. 
Selegiline has been shown to be efficacious in Parkinson's disease, global 
ischemia, Gille de la Tourette syndrome, and narcolepsy. Its therapeutic 
efficacy in Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain. In Alzheimer's disease, short 
term studies of selegiline suggest a beneficial effect; whereas long term 
studies are less convincing.

While at present there is no scientific consensus on the reasons for cellular 
and organismal ageing--or indeed on a comprehensive definition for 
ageing--scientific efforts to unravel the complex biochemistry behind the ageing 
process have recently met with considerable success. Despite a still somewhat 
fragmented understanding of the phenomenon of ageing, a distinction has 
therefore become possible between those biochemical and physiological events 
that are causal to ageing, and those that merely accompany the process. Such a 
distinction is an important prerequisite for the selection of targets for 
pharmacological intervention, and for the design of "anti-ageing drugs" directed 
against these targets. This review looks from a chemical viewpoint at currently 
used model systems for the ageing process, at small molecules showing 
anti-ageing properties in these screens, and at their mechanisms of action.

Clinical experiences with laser-welded titanium frameworks supported by implants 
in the edentulous mandible: a 10-year follow-up study.

BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up studies for more than 5 years are not available 
on laser-welded titanium frameworks.
PURPOSE: To report and compare 10-year data on implant-supported prostheses in 
the edentulous mandible provided with laser-welded titanium frameworks and 
conventional gold alloy frameworks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Altogether, 155 patients were consecutively treated with 
prostheses at abutment level with two generations of fixed laser-welded titanium 
frameworks (test groups). A control group of 53 randomly selected patients with 
conventional gold alloy castings was used for comparison. Clinical and 
radiographic 10-year data were collected for the three groups.
RESULTS: All patients followed-up for 10 years (n=112) still had fixed 
prostheses in the mandible (cumulative success rate [CSR] 100%). The overall 
10-year cumulative success rate (CSR) was 92.8 and 100.0% for titanium and gold 
alloy frameworks, respectively. Ten-year implant cumulative survival rate (CSR) 
was 99.4 and 99.6% for the test and control groups, respectively. Average 
10-year bone loss was 0.56 (SD 0.45) mm for the titanium group and 0.77 (SD 
0.36) mm for the control group (p < 0.05). The most common complications for 
titanium frameworks were resin or veneer fractures, soft tissue inflammation, 
and fractures (12.9%) of the metal frame. Loose and fractured implant screw 
components were below 3%.
CONCLUSION: Excellent overall long-term results with 100% CSR could be achieved 
with the present treatment modality. Fractures of the metal frames and remade 
prostheses were more common for the laser-welded titanium frameworks, and the 
first generation of titanium frameworks worked poorly when compared with gold 
alloy frameworks during 10 years (p < 0.05). However, on average more bone loss 
was observed for implants supporting gold alloy frameworks during 10 years. The 
reasons for this difference are not clear.

A pilot study of complete edentulous rehabilitation with immediate function 
using a new implant design: case series.

Maló P(1), Nobre Mde A, Petersson U, Wigren S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Implantology, Maló Clinic, Lisbon, Portugal.

BACKGROUND: The current investigation focuses on new implant designs for 
increased predictability in clinically demanding situations. Microtextured 
implant surfaces create favorable conditions for enhanced osseointegration of 
dental implants compared to implants with a smooth surface, and the macroscopic 
implant design may influence implant stability.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the 
clinical performance of a novel implant design in the rehabilitation of 
completely edentulous jaws and in combination with an immediate function 
protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients received 189 study 
implants (NobelSpeedy concept implant, Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) 
supporting 53 full-arch all-acrylic prostheses (44 maxilla, 9 mandible). The 
majority (66%) of the reconstructions were supported by four implants, of which 
the two posterior implants were tilted. All patients were followed for a minimum 
of 1 year. Radiographic assessment of the marginal bone level was performed.
RESULTS: Two implants were lost in two patients, rendering a 1-year cumulative 
clinical survival rate of 98.9%. The marginal bone level was, on average, 
situated 1.2 +/- 0.7 mm below the implant-abutment interface after 1 year of 
loading. Good soft tissue health and overall esthetic outcome was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present pilot study indicate that fully 
edentulous jaws with various types of bone can be treated with high success and 
good esthetics using immediately loaded implants with the presented design, and 
that favorable marginal bone levels can be maintained.

Age-related macular degeneration--emerging pathogenetic and therapeutic 
concepts.

City, IA 52240, USA.

Today, the average life expectancy in developed nations is over 80 years and 
climbing. And yet, the quality of life during those additional years is often 
significantly diminished by the effects of age-related, degenerative diseases, 
including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness 
in the elderly worldwide. AMD is characterized by a progressive loss of central 
vision attributable to degenerative and neovascular changes in the macula, a 
highly specialized region of the ocular retina responsible for fine visual 
acuity. Estimates gathered from the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) 
global eye disease survey conservatively indicate that 14 million persons are 
blind or severely visually impaired because of AMD. The disease has a tremendous 
impact on the physical and mental health of the geriatric population and their 
families and is becoming a major public health burden. Currently, there is 
neither a cure nor a means to prevent AMD. Palliative treatment options for the 
less prevalent, late-stage 'wet' form of the disease include anti-neovascular 
agents, photodynamic therapy and thermal laser. There are no current therapies 
for the more common 'dry' AMD, except for the use of antioxidants that delay 
progression in 20%-25% of eyes. New discoveries, however, are beginning to 
provide a much clearer picture of the relevant cellular events, genetic factors, 
and biochemical processes associated with early AMD. Recently, compelling 
evidence has emerged that the innate immune system and, more specifically, 
uncontrolled regulation of the complement alternative pathway plays a central 
role in the pathobiology of AMD. The complement Factor H gene--which encodes the 
major inhibitor of the complement alternative pathway--is the first gene 
identified in multiple independent studies that confers a significant genetic 
risk for the development of AMD. The emergence of this new paradigm of AMD 
pathogenesis should hasten the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches for this disease that will dramatically improve the quality of our 
prolonged lifespan.

Colorectal cancer screening in young patients with poor health and severe 
comorbidity.

Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA. shahnaz.sultan@medicine.ufl.edu

BACKGROUND: Young patients with poor health and a high risk of mortality from 
comorbid diseases have less chance of deriving a survival benefit from 
colorectal cancer screening. The aim of this study was to examine the 
relationship between colorectal cancer screening, self-reported health status, 
and comorbidity in a cohort of young patients, defined as patients between the 
ages of 50 and 64 years.
METHODS: This was a single-center study conducted at a Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center from October 1, 1996, to March 30, 2004. Colorectal cancer screening 
information was obtained from 861 outpatients who completed the 36-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey (measure of health status) and the Kaplan-Feinstein 
Index (comorbidity score). Rates of screening were examined by age, physical 
component summary score, and severity of comorbid illnesses.
RESULTS: Of the veterans, 45.9% had undergone screening within 5 years of their 
index visit. Screening rates were high among patients with moderate (44.9%) and 
severe (45.8%) comorbidities. When stratified by age group and physical 
component summary quartile, there was a trend toward increasing screening rates 
with better health status in the 50- to 54- and 55- to 59-year age groups. In 
the 60- to 64-year age group, high screening rates for patients with poorer 
health were observed: physical component summary quartiles 1 and 2, 55.7% and 
54.2%, respectively. Fifty-two patients died during the 5-year follow-up; 37 
(71.2%) had undergone screening for colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Young patients with potentially reduced life expectancy are being 
screened for colorectal cancer at relatively high rates. Comprehensive 
assessment of health status and comorbidity should guide cancer screening 
decisions, especially in individuals with reduced life expectancy who may obtain 
the least benefit from screening.

Quality-adjusted health status in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.

Author information:

the Division of Health Services Research, University of Arkansas for Medical 
Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA.

This study evaluated the quality-adjusted health status in veterans with 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a cross-sectional study veterans 
diagnosed with PTSD completed a quality-adjusted health status measure (Quality 
of Well-Being Self-Administered [QWB-SA] scale), PTSD symptom severity measures 
(Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD and Clinician-Administered PTSD 
Scale), and a depression severity measure (Beck Depression Inventory). 
Significant inverse relationships were identified between the QWB-SA and PTSD 
severity measures as well as between the QWB-SA and depression severity measures 
in this sample. Demonstration of these relationships suggests that greater 
symptom severity is associated with lower quality-adjusted health status in 
veterans with PTSD. More importantly, the QWB-SA was designed for use in 
cost-effectiveness analyses and may be useful in assessing the relative value of 
PTSD interventions compared with other mental and physical health interventions.

Superoxide dismutase activities in long-lived Drosophila melanogaster females: 
chico1 genotypes and dietary dilution.

Kabil H(1), Partridge L, Harshman LG.

Author information:
(1)School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, 
68588, USA.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined for dietary dilution 
conditions that extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster. The hypothesis 
motivating this research was that elevated SOD activity is associated with 
increased life span resulting from flies being held on a restricted diet. SOD 
activities were also measured for chico (1) which is a mutation in the insulin 
receptor substrate protein gene associated with life span extension. This 
allowed us to confirm the results of (Clancy et al. 2001) and extend the results 
by measuring CuZn SOD and Mn SOD activities in addition to the previously 
determined overall SOD activity. If the same form of SOD activity (CuZn SOD or 
Mn SOD) was elevated on the dilute diet that extends life span and in the long 
lived chico (1) homozygotes, then it would suggest that life span extension by 
dietary restriction and by insulin signaling mutations has a similar underlying 
mechanism. However, overall SOD activity, and CuZn SOD or Mn SOD activities did 
not differ among the diets tested. As observed previously (Clancy et al. 2001), 
overall SOD activity was elevated in chico (1) homozygotes compared to the 
heterozygote or wild type. Results from the present study indicate that elevated 
CuZn SOD activity, not Mn SOD, is the basis for the relatively high level of SOD 
activity in the chico (1) homozygotes.

Is SENS a farrago?

de Grey AD(1).

Author information:
(1)Methuselah Foundation, Cambridge, United Kingdom. aubrey@sens.org

SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) is a panel of proposed 
interventions in mammalian aging that I have suggested may be sufficiently 
feasible, comprehensive, and amenable to subsequent incremental refinement that 
it could prevent death from old age (at any age) within a time frame of decades, 
leading to four-digit lifespans of many people alive today. This extreme 
conclusion has drawn sharp criticism from some colleagues, especially because 
the methodology of SENS departs radically from approaches generally considered 
the most promising ways to combat aging and because it is perceived as 
endangering biogerontology's respectability. Here I briefly respond to these 
criticisms.

The goal of biogerontological research is to elucidate the biological factors 
underlying adverse age-related changes in structure and function of molecules, 
cells, tissues, and organisms. In spite of the considerable progress achieved so 
far, it is still too early to predict what strategies will be both safe and 
effective at preventing, delaying, or reversing these changes in humans, and 
whether such strategies will also increase longevity.

Site-specific integration into the human genome: ready for clinical application?

Recchia A(1), Mavilio F.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 
Modena, Italy.

Inserting genetic information at precise locations into the human genome has 
been the goal of the gene therapy community for almost two decades. Despite 
their spectacular progress in many fields of mammalian genetics, genome editing 
and homologous recombination are still too inefficient to be applied to human 
primary cells and tissues, the targets of any medical application. Site-specific 
integration, or the insertion of genes at known locations by enzymes that target 
recognition capacity, has progressed slowly but steadily in recent years, and 
could very well be the basis of the next generation of gene transfer technology.

Assessing dementia in people with learning disabilities: the relationship 
between two screening measures.

Kirk LJ(1), Hick R, Laraway A.

Author information:
(1)Lancaster University, UK.

As life expectancy increases for people with learning disabilities, the impact 
of dementia on people with learning disabilities and their families, carers and 
services is becoming more apparent. Psychological services for learning 
disabilities are receiving an increasing number of referrals requesting dementia 
assessment. Health and social care services are adapting to the diverse needs of 
an ageing population with learning disabilities. This article describes a study 
investigating the relationship between two assessments for dementia in people 
with learning disabilities. Carers of people with learning disabilities over the 
age of 50 (or 40 if the individual had Down syndrome) completed the Dementia 
Questionnaire for Mentally Retarded People and the Adaptive Behaviour 
Scale--Residential and Community. Overall, the two questionnaire measures showed 
significant relationships. However, results suggested that both assessments have 
clinical value in informing individual needs and aiding diagnosis. Implications 
for both clinical and social care services are discussed.

CONTEXT: Most guidelines do not recommend prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
screening in elderly men who have limited life expectancies because the known 
harms of screening outweigh potential benefits. However, there are no 
large-scale studies of actual PSA screening practices in elderly men, according 
to life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the extent of PSA screening among elderly men, 
including those with limited life expectancies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study of 597 642 male veterans aged 70 
years and older who were seen at 104 US Department of Veterans Affairs 
facilities during both 2002 and 2003, without a history of prostate cancer, 
elevated PSA, or prostate cancer symptoms. Charlson comorbidity scores were used 
to stratify men into 3 groups ranging from best health (score = 0) to worst 
health (score >or= 4).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Receipt of PSA testing during 2003 was based on US 
Department of Veterans Affairs data and Medicare claims.
RESULTS: In 2003, 56% of elderly men had a PSA test performed. Although PSA 
screening rates decreased with advancing age, within each 5-year age group the 
percentage of men who underwent a PSA test did not substantially decline with 
worsening health. For example, among men aged 85 years and older, 34% in best 
health had a PSA test compared with 36% in worst health. In multivariate 
analyses, many nonclinical factors, such as marital status and region of the 
country, had a greater effect on PSA screening than health, and screening rates 
exceeded 60% for some subgroups of men in worst health.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate-specific antigen screening rates among elderly veterans 
with limited life expectancies should be much lower than current practice given 
the known harms of screening. More attention to prognosis is needed when making 
screening PSA recommendations to elderly men.

CONTEXT: Healthy survival has no clear phenotypic definition, and little is 
known about its attributes, particularly in men.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether midlife biological, lifestyle, and sociodemographic 
risk factors are associated with overall survival and exceptional survival (free 
of a set of major diseases and impairments).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study within the Honolulu 
Heart Program/Honolulu Asia Aging Study. A total of 5820 Japanese American 
middle-aged men (mean age, 54 [range, 45-68] years) free of morbidity and 
functional impairments were followed for up to 40 years (1965-2005) to assess 
overall and exceptional survival. Exceptional survival was defined as survival 
to a specified age (75, 80, 85, or 90 years) without incidence of 6 major 
chronic diseases and without physical and cognitive impairment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Overall survival and exceptional survival.
RESULTS: Of 5820 original participants, 2451 participants (42%) survived to age 
85 years and 655 participants (11%) met the criteria for exceptional survival to 
age 85 years. High grip strength and avoidance of overweight, hyperglycemia, 
hypertension, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption were associated with 
both overall and exceptional survival. In addition, high education and avoidance 
of hypertriglyceridemia were associated with exceptional survival, and lack of a 
marital partner was associated with mortality before age 85 years. Risk factor 
models based on cumulative risk factors (survival risk score) suggest that the 
probability of survival to oldest age is as high as 69% with no risk factors and 
as low as 22% with 6 or more risk factors. The probability of exceptional 
survival to age 85 years was 55% with no risk factors but decreased to 9% with 6 
or more risk factors.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that avoidance of certain risk factors in midlife 
is associated with the probability of a long and healthy life among men.

Mitral valve repair for severe mitral regurgitation: the way forward?

Severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) has a poor outcome if left uncorrected. 
Successful mitral valve repair has the unique potential to restore normal life 
expectancy and is superior to valve replacement. Despite this, mitral repair is 
performed relatively infrequently and many patients with potentially reparable 
valves have a replacement instead, subjecting them to unnecessary risk. Surgery 
in asymptomatic patients is a particularly difficult issue with some units 
advocating surgery irrespective of symptoms, based purely on the severity of 
regurgitation. This strategy cannot be widely adopted with the current patchy 
provision of high-quality valve repair surgery. Misplaced enthusiasm for early 
operation runs the risk of a failed repair and the hazards of a mechanical 
prosthesis. To ensure optimal treatment for patients with MR, cardiologists must 
be aware of the indications for valve repair and ensure that patients with 
potentially reparable valves are referred to surgeons with proven expertise, 
even if this means a shift from established practice. Surgical units need to 
promote subspecialization and rigorously audit their outcomes. There are 
currently no agreed standards for best practice in mitral valve repair and this 
is an area where professional societies may wish to take a role.

Science, University of Edinburgh, Medical Quad, Teviot Place, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, 
Scotland, UK. rachael.wood@ed.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate healthy life expectancy (HLE) as a measure of health 
inequalities by comparing geographical and area-based deprivation-related 
inequalities in healthy and total life expectancy (TLE).
DESIGN: Life table analysis based on ecological cross-sectional data.
SETTING AND POPULATION: Council area quarters and postcode sector-based 
deprivation fifths in Scotland.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expectation of life in good self-assessed general health, 
or free from limiting long-term illness, and TLE, for females and males at 
birth.
RESULTS: Women in Scotland have a life expectation of 70.3 years in good health, 
61.6 years free from limiting long-term illness, and a TLE of 78.9 years. 
Comparable figures for men are 66.3, 58.6 and 73.5 years. TLE and HLE decrease 
with increasing area deprivation. Differences are substantially wider for HLE. A 
4.7-year difference is seen in TLE between women living in the most and least 
deprived fifth of areas. The difference in HLE is 10.7 years in good health and 
11.6 years free from limiting long-term illness. The degree of 
deprivation-related inequality in HLE is 2.5 times wider for women and 1.8 times 
wider for men than in TLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in TLE underestimate health inequalities substantially. 
By including morbidity and mortality, HLE reflects the excess burden of ill 
health experienced by disadvantaged populations better. Inequalities in length 
of life and health status during life should be taken into account while 
monitoring inequalities in population health.

Health and Cliniques Universitaires St Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain.

Ubiquitous informatics in health care can be seen as its pervasively presence 
everywhere, at home as well as in office and patient room, for various purposes 
such as patient follow up, health care professional training, aid to decision 
making and to public health management. Its worldwide rapid extension could only 
happen in relation to major progresses such as overall availability of personal 
computers, diffusion through the worldwide web as well as coverage of almost all 
fields of medicine. Challenges include a profound change in patient-physician 
relationship, a reform in health care management and financial methods, as well 
as the need to identify uniquely all healthcare partners, while respecting 
confidentiality and private life.

The emerging amalgamation of informatics, communication technologies, and 
entertainment electronics in the field of Biomedical Technology combined to, 
first, the increase in length of the mean life expectancy, and, second, the 
hospitalization cost avalanche, will facilitate gradually the development of a 
new Hi-Tec home-care environment. We have developed a home-computer based 
system, addressing crucial aspects of the development of contemporary home-care 
that comprises of: First, the employment of low-cost commercially available 
components, supporting home-care patient's well-being observation, including 
eventually vital-signs monitoring. Second, software means for the processing, 
the evaluation, and the targeted transmission of the acquired health-data. 
Third, software tools for the planning, the documentation, and the management of 
the corresponding home-care case. The present paper constitutes a progress 
report of the ongoing development efforts.

Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. vgocha@mindspring.com

PURPOSE: The study was designed to examine relationships between range of motion 
(ROM), functional mobility, and quality of life (QL) in patients with 
lower-extremity sarcoma (LES) after limb-sparing surgery
METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with LES (age, 10-26 years) participated. The 
patients performed hip flexion, hip extension, knee flexion, and knee extension, 
Timed Up and Down Stairs (TUDS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), nine-minute run-walk 
(9-min), and completed the QL measure, Short-Form-36 version two (SF-36v2).
RESULTS: Significant correlations (p < 0.01) were found between hip extension 
and SF-36v2 physical component scale (PCS; r = 0.33), TUDS (r = -0.32), TUG (r = 
-0.33); hip flexion and TUDS (r = -0.31), TUG (r = -0.39), 9-min (r = 0.44); 
knee flexion and TUDS (r = -0.52), TUG (r = -0.40), 9-min (r = 0.37); SF-36v2 
PCS and TUDS (r = -0.56), TUG (r = -0.51), 9-min (r = 0.60).
CONCLUSION: ROM correlates with functional mobility and QL in patients with LES 
after limb-sparing surgery. ROM exercises are important component of a physical 
therapy program for children and adolescents with LES.

Columbia, Canada.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess Health-Related Quality of Life outcomes in patients 
undergoing surgery for spinal metastases.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Increasing life expectancy of patients with spinal 
metastases has resulted in greater interest in overall quality of life, 
including pain and neurologic impairment. To assess the overall risks and 
benefits of surgical intervention, the overall impact of each on the overall 
health status must be assessed.
METHODS: All patients who presented to a single institution with bony spinal 
metastases requiring surgical intervention were eligible.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: previous surgery for spinal metastases, primary tumors of 
the spine, and inability to fill out the questionnaires. Patients completed an 
EORTC QLQ-C30, the HUI-3, the EQ-5D, visual analog pain, and an ECOG functional 
assessment. at five points: before surgery and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 
and 1 year post surgery.
RESULTS: Of 96 patients who presented to the hospital, 85 were enrolled in the 
study. Average age was 58.6 years (range, 20.3-80.7 years) with 47 male 
patients; 50% survival as 39.1 weeks. Maximal and average VAS pain levels showed 
a statistically significant (P < 0.00001) improvement from preoperative to all 
postoperative time points. Only the QLQ-C30 global health status showed a 
statistically significant improvement from preoperative to the 6-week (P = 
0.017), 3-month (P = 0.039), and 6-month (P = 0.013) time points. There was a 
statistically significant correlation between baseline global health status and 
survival time (P = 0.041). Overall distribution of HUI-3 utility calculated 
Quality of Life Adjusted Years (QALY) during the 1-year postoperative period 
showed a bimodal distribution with peaks at 0.1 and 0.7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for patients with spinal metastases offers decreased pain 
and improved quality of life with low rates of surgical complications.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy remains an untreatable genetic disease that severely 
limits motility and life expectancy in affected children. The only animal model 
specifically reproducing the alterations in the dystrophin gene and the full 
spectrum of human pathology is the golden retriever dog model. Affected animals 
present a single mutation in intron 6, resulting in complete absence of the 
dystrophin protein, and early and severe muscle degeneration with nearly 
complete loss of motility and walking ability. Death usually occurs at about 1 
year of age as a result of failure of respiratory muscles. Here we report that 
intra-arterial delivery of wild-type canine mesoangioblasts (vessel-associated 
stem cells) results in an extensive recovery of dystrophin expression, normal 
muscle morphology and function (confirmed by measurement of contraction force on 
single fibres). The outcome is a remarkable clinical amelioration and 
preservation of active motility. These data qualify mesoangioblasts as 
candidates for future stem cell therapy for Duchenne patients.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis. A 
substantial proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C eventually develop 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the leading causes of death 
worldwide. Therefore, efficient antiviral treatments for HCV have long been 
needed. A recently developed combination therapy of pegylated interferon and 
ribavirin has dramatically improved the outcome of antiviral therapy for HCV 
infection. In genotype 1b HCV infection, 48 weeks of the combination therapy 
achieved eradication of the virus in 50% of patients, and in genotype 2 HCV 
infection, 24 weeks of the therapy resulted in viral eradication in 80%-90% of 
patients. By this eradication, an improvement in the hepatic fibrosis, an 
inhibition of HCC development, and an improvement in life expectancy were 
attained. Patients who did not respond to the combination therapy may be treated 
with long-term interferon monotherapy, which is not intended to eradicate HCV, 
but will lower the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. Thus, the 
treatment for HCV infection has progressed significantly, but therapies with new 
modalities, such as inhibitors of viral protease or RNA polymerase, are still 
being awaited.

The long-term cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or 
without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P) is an effective treatment for 
patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony with moderate or severe 
symptoms despite pharmacological therapy. The addition of an implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function may further reduce the risk of sudden 
death. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with medical therapy 
(MT) alone, and the cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD + MT compared with CRT-P + MT, 
on incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and life year using 
data from two landmark clinical trials.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess costs, 
life years, and QALYs associated with CRT (+/- ICD) and MT in patients with 
heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony, on the basis of a UK healthcare 
perspective was constructed. NYHA class distribution and transitions, associated 
health utilities, rates and cause of hospitalization and death were estimated 
from individual patient data from the CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure 
(CARE-HF trial). The estimated additional benefit on survival of an ICD was 
based on results from COMPANION. The base case analysis used 10 000 individual 
life-time simulations assuming a battery life of 6 years for CRT-P and 7 years 
for CRT-ICD. From a life-time perspective in a 65-year-old patient, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with MT is 7538 euros (95% CI 
5325-11,784 euros) per QALY gained and 7011euros (95% CI 5346-10,003 euros) per 
life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD compared with 
CRT-P is 47,909 euros (95% CI 35,703-79,438 euros) per QALY gained, and 35,864 
euros (95% CI 26,709-56,353 euros) per life year gained.
CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with CRT-P appears cost-effective compared with 
MT alone. From a life-time perspective, assuming a reasonable life expectancy 
when receiving effective treatment for heart failure, CRT-ICD may also be 
considered cost-effective when compared with CRT-P + MT.

Acute aortic dissection is gaining recognition in Western societies, and is 
being diagnosed with increasing frequency. New diagnostic imaging modalities, 
longer life expectancy in general, as well as the increase in the number of 
hypertension patients have all contributed to the growing awareness of aortic 
dissections. Compared with acute coronary syndrome and lung embolism, aortic 
dissection is among the most frequently diagnosed life-threatening conditions 
involving chest pain. Here we report the case of a 59 year old patient suffering 
from hypertension and discuss the latest diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 
in the setting of acute chest pain.

[Changes in the transplantation world--from altruism to a utilitarian approach].

[Article in Hebrew]

Mor E(1).

Author information:

The lack of organs for transplantation is a worldwide problem that has created a 
moral conflict between the traditional altruistic basis of organ donation and 
alternative solutions based on utilitarian grounds. Survival of grafts achieved 
in recent decades after unrelated living-donor kidney transplantation between 
spouses is longer than with deceased donor transplantation. This experience 
justified the extension of kidney donation beyond the traditional close family 
relationships including: anonymous donors and paired exchange programs. However, 
unrelated donation of kidneys within altruistic norms could not provide an 
ultimate solution for the lack of organs for transplantation. On the other hand, 
globalization and development of advanced medical technology in developing 
countries that do not provide transplantation for all their citizens, created an 
opportunity for a worldwide flourish of transplant tourism as an alternative 
solution for transplant candidates. Transplant tourism functions according to 
market laws and is profit-driven, as opposed to the legal organ exchange 
programs in Europe and the U.S.A., which are non-profit and patient-oriented. 
The transition from trade in kidneys from unrelated living-donors to the use of 
other organs (heart, lung and liver) from death penalty prisoners in China was 
only a matter of deciding where to lay the moral border when justifying the act 
for the sake of life-saving. Considering the inability of current legal 
altruistic transplantation practice to supply the growing need for organs,
