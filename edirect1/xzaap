Histone deacetylases (HDACs) such as HDAC1 and HSIR2 have been known to be 
involved in the regulation of life-span extension. However, its underlying 
mechanism remains unclear in human. Using the primary human gingival fibroblasts 
(HGFs) derived from donors of different ages, which exhibit clear features of 
senescence in aged HGFs, we demonstrated that histone deacetylase, HDAC1 and 
HSIR2, repressed the ageing through the transcriptional inactivation of p53 and 
p21 promoters. These results suggest that primary HGFs can be a useful human 
ageing model, and HDAC1, HSIR2, p53 and p21 may play an important role in ageing 
process of human beings.

Body weight, hormones and T cell subsets as predictors of life span in 
genetically heterogeneous mice.

Arbor, MI, USA.

Previous studies have shown that T cell subset levels, early life body weight, 
and levels of leptin and thyroid hormones can each serve, independently, as 
predictors of life span in populations of genetically heterogeneous mice. New 
data now confirm, in a replicate cohort, that T cell subset patterns predict 
longevity, and show that they can do so when measured in mice as young as 8 
months of age. Individual T cell subsets, as well as composite indices that 
combine data from two or more T cell measures at 8 or 18 months, can be combined 
with 3- and 9-month body weight data to provide better prediction of life span 
than either immune or weight measures alone. Mice whose immune and weight 
measures are both in the lowest quartile have mean and maximal life spans that 
are 18% and 16-25% higher, respectively, than mice in the opposite quartiles for 
both traits. Thyroxine levels measured at 4 months lead to further improvement 
over models that combine weight and immune data only. A genome scan provided 
evidence for loci on chromosomes 2, 12, 13, and 17 that modulate age-sensitive T 
cell subset patterns at both 8 and 18 months of age. These data show that 
late-life mortality risks are influenced to a measurable degree by factors that 
modulate growth trajectory and hormone and immune status in the first third of 
the life span, and provide clues as to which early life systems deserve further 
scrutiny as potential mediators of late life disease risk.

SE5 8AF.

BACKGROUND: Training care givers reduces their burden and improves psychosocial 
outcomes in care givers and patients at one year. However, the cost 
effectiveness of this approach has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of caregiver training by examining 
health and social care costs, informal care costs, and quality adjusted life 
years in care givers.
DESIGN: A single, blind, randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Stroke rehabilitation unit.
SUBJECTS: 300 stroke patients and their care givers.
INTERVENTIONS: Caregiver training in basic nursing and facilitation of personal 
care techniques compared with no care giver training.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health and social care costs, informal care costs, and 
quality adjusted life years in care givers over one year after stroke.
RESULTS: Total health and social care costs over one year for patients whose 
care givers received training were significantly lower (mean difference -4043 
pounds sterling (7249 dollars; 6072 euros), 95% confidence interval -6544 pounds 
sterling to -595 pounds sterling). Inclusion of informal care costs, which were 
similar between the two groups, did not alter this conclusion. The cost 
difference was largely due to differences in length of hospital stay. The EQ-5D 
did not detect changes in quality adjusted life years in care givers.
CONCLUSION: Compared with no training, caregiver training during rehabilitation 
of patients reduced costs of care while improving overall quality of life in 
care givers at one year.

    J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004 Jul;114(1):127-30.

BACKGROUND: Beta-blocker therapy postmyocardial infarction is generally 
recommended because it reduces mortality. However, beta-blockers may increase 
anaphylaxis mortality in the growing population of patients with peanut-induced 
anaphylaxis.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the risks and benefits of beta-blocker therapy 
among patients with peanut allergy and heart disease.
METHODS: We created a Markov model for patients with heart disease at risk for 
peanut-induced anaphylaxis to compare life expectancy with the following 
strategies: (1) beta-blocker and (2) no beta-blocker. Meta-analysis and a 
literature review were used to estimate model parameters. We performed 
sensitivity analysis to explore parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: For peanut-allergic patients who are postmyocardial infarction or who 
have congestive heart failure, the heart disease benefit of beta-blockers 
outweighs the increased likelihood of dying from anaphylaxis, increasing life 
expectancy by 9.4 and 17.4 months, respectively. Beta-blocker was preferred 
unless (1) the annual rate of moderate to severe anaphylaxis exceeded 6.0% for 
postmyocardial infarction and 15% for congestive heart failure patients; (2) 
beta-blocker therapy increased the incidence of moderate to severe anaphylaxis 
>2.5-fold for postmyocardial infarction and >5.8-fold for congestive heart 
failure patients; (3) anaphylaxis case fatality exceeded 6.5% postmyocardial 
infarction; or (4) beta-blocker therapy increased anaphylaxis case fatality 
>25-fold postmyocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that for patients postmyocardial infarction or 
with congestive heart failure who are at risk for peanut-induced anaphylaxis, 
beta-blocker use should still improve survival. However, the epidemiology of 
anaphylaxis and effects of beta-blocker therapy on anaphylaxis incidence and 
mortality require further study.

Fecal DNA testing compared with conventional colorectal cancer screening 
methods: a decision analysis.

California-San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94143-0538, 
USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal DNA testing is an emerging tool to detect colorectal 
cancer (CRC). Our aims were to estimate the clinical and economic consequences 
of fecal DNA testing vs. conventional CRC screening.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated CRC incidence, CRC mortality, and 
discounted cost/life-year gained for screening by fecal DNA testing (F-DNA), 
fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and/or sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy (COLO) in 
persons at average CRC risk from age 50 to 80 years.
RESULTS: Compared with no screening, F-DNA at a screening interval of 5 years 
decreased CRC incidence by 35% and CRC mortality by 54% and gained 4560 
life-years per 100,000 persons at USD $47,700/life-year gained in the base case. 
However, F-DNA gained fewer life-years and was more costly than conventional 
screening. The average number of colonoscopies per person was 3.8 with COLO and 
0.8 with F-DNA. In most 1-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation 
iterations, F-DNA remained reasonably cost-effective compared with no screening, 
but COLO and FOBT dominated F-DNA. Assuming fecal DNA testing sensitivities of 
65% for CRC and 40% for large polyp, and 95% specificity, a screening interval 
of 2 years and a test cost of USD $195 would be required to make F-DNA 
comparable with COLO.
CONCLUSIONS: Fecal DNA testing every 5 years appears effective and 
cost-effective compared with no screening, but inferior to other strategies such 
as FOBT and COLO. Fecal DNA testing could decrease the national CRC burden if it 
could improve adherence with screening, particularly where the capacity to 
perform screening colonoscopy is limited.

Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the elderly.

Italy. raffaele_antonelli@rm.unicatt.it

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of death and 
disability in the elderly, is frequently unrecognized or misinterpreted as heart 
disease. Comorbidity plays a primary role, both as a determinant of health 
status and as a prognostic marker in older populations with COPD. 
Multidimensional assessment tailored to the distinctive needs of respiratory 
patients and thus including selected respiratory function indexes, is mandatory 
for proper staging COPD and monitoring of its course and response to therapy. In 
stable COPD, a mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures may 
improve health, but only by stopping smoking and, in the event of respiratory 
insufficiency, applying continuous oxygen therapy can the progression of the 
disease be delayed and life expectancy prolonged. In exacerbated COPD, age per 
se is a negative prognostic marker and, while many very old patients can 
successfully recover, they will experience some decline in personal 
independence. Thus, older patients with COPD should ideally be the object of a 
continuum of care throughout all the stages of their disease, in order to 
minimize the decline in personal independence and worsening health. In this 
perspective, COPD patients qualify as optimal candidates for dedicated programs 
of continuous geriatric care.

Life-threatening idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis in elderly patients.

Agranulocytosis is a life-threatening disorder in any age, but particularly so 
in elderly patients who are receiving, on average, a larger number of drugs than 
younger patients. Drug-induced agranulocytosis still remains a rare event, with 
an annual incidence rate of approximately 3-12 cases per million population. 
This disorder frequently occurs as an adverse reaction to drugs, particularly 
antibacterials, antiplatelet agents, antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics or 
antiepileptic drugs, and NSAIDs. Although patients experiencing drug-induced 
agranulocytosis may initially be asymptomatic, the severity of the neutropenia 
usually translates into the onset of severe sepsis that requires intravenous 
broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. In this setting, haematopoietic growth 
factors have been shown to shorten the duration of neutropenia. Thus, with 
appropriate management, the mortality rate of idiosyncratic drug-induced 
agranulocytosis is now 5-10%. However, given the increased life expectancy and 
subsequent longer exposure to drugs, as well as the development of new agents, 
physicians should be aware of this complication and its management.

Science, Department of Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and

The use of bicistronic vectors, which contain two target genes under one 
promoter, has been the most common practice for the heterologous production of 
binary protein complexes. The major problem of this method is the much lower 
expression of the second gene compared with that of the first gene next to the 
promoter. We tested a simple idea of whether inclusion of an additional promoter 
in front of the second gene may remove the problem. Compared with bicistronic 
vectors, corresponding two-promoter vectors yielded four to nine times larger 
amounts of the complexes between BCL-2 family proteins, BCL-X(L):BAD, 
BCL-X(L):BIM-S, and CED-9:EGL-1 in bacterial cells as a result of significantly 
increased expression of the second genes in a manner independent of the order of 
the target genes. With the two-promoter system, we produced two other complexes 
in large quantity suitable for extensive crystallization trial. The method does 
not accompany any technical disadvantages, and represents a significant 
improvement from the conventional method, which should enjoy wide application 
for the coexpression of binary or higher order protein complexes by extension.

Lung transplantation is indicated for patients with cystic fibrosis, emphysema, 
pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension whose life expectancy is less than 
two years. Criteria of severity are detailed. Three types of transplantation can 
be proposed: single lung transplant for fibrosis and dry emphysema; bilateral 
lung transplant for cystic fibrosis, and certain types of emphysema and 
pulmonary hypertension; heart-lung transplant for pulmonary hypertension and 
Eisenmenger syndrome. Due to insufficient supply of donor organs, one quarter of 
the candidates die on the waiting list and the limit for inscription is often 60 
years. Postoperative mortality at two months is about 15% and is related to 
graft dysfunction, infection, bronchial complications,... Acute rejection 
usually occurs during the first year. Chronic rejection is expressed by 
obliterating bronchiolitis, the leading cause of death after one year. There is 
a risk of cancer (EBV-induced lymphoproliferative syndromes and skin cancer). 
Five-year survival is still only about 50%. Immunosuppressor treatments still 
cause numerous adverse effects (hypertension, renal toxicity...); function and 
quality-of-life have however greatly improved.

Hip fracture patients are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolic 
events (VTEs) postoperatively. Efficacy and safety data from a clinical trial 
comparing fondaparinux and enoxaparin as VTE prophylaxis were used to perform a 
cost assessment of these 2 agents. Incremental cost calculations demonstrate 
that enoxaparin offers advantages over fondaparinux when dosed for 7 days 
postoperatively in this patient population. Sensitivity analyses support this 
finding at the lower extreme; however, fondaparinux provides cost savings at the 
upper extreme. Cost per death averted and cost per life year gained are similar 
for these 2 agents in these patients.

Sudden cardiac death in hereditary hemochromatosis: an underestimated cause of 
death?

Klintschar M(1), Stiller D.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a frequent autosomal recessive disease which 
causes iron-overload of various organs. Of all northern European affected 
individuals, 90-95% show 1 of 3 known point mutations in the HFE gene. Symptoms 
and organs involved can vary considerably: Only a small fraction of the 
200,000-400,000 persons affected in Germany develop the classical picture of 
liver cirrhosis and/or pancreatic fibrosis. Nevertheless, the life expectancy of 
persons with moderate or even subclinical symptoms is reduced, in many cases due 
to myocardial damage leading to cardiomyopathy with greatly increased risk of 
sudden cardiac death. Although the high prevalence of HH suggests that sudden 
cardiac death due to cardiac HH is a relatively common cause of death, the 
forensic literature lacks such reports. We present the case of sudden cardiac 
death in a young man with histological findings of massive cardial 
hemochromatosis which is characterized by the fact that none of the three known 
mutations for HH were found. This case demonstrates that genetic screening alone 
might not be sufficient to identify all persons at risk to developing HH.

Age influences resistance of Caenorhabditis elegans to killing by pathogenic 
bacteria.

Caenorhabditis elegans has previously been proposed as an alternative host for 
models of infectious disease caused by human pathogens. When exposed to some 
human pathogenic bacteria, the life span of nematodes is significantly reduced. 
We have shown that mutations in the age-1, and/or age-2 genes of C. elegans, 
that normally enhance life expectancy, can also increase resistance to killing 
by the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica var. 
Typhimurium, Burkholderia cepacia or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We also found 
that the rate at which wild-type C. elegans was killed by the bacterial 
pathogens tested increased as nematodes aged. In the case of P. aeruginosa 
infection, the difference in life span of wild type and age-1 mutants of C. 
elegans was not due to differences in the level of bacterial colonisation of the 
gut.

Induction of calcium-activated potassium channel activity by hemin in human 
erythroleukemia cells.

The agent hemin has been demonstrated to be able to initiate a coordinated 
differentiation program in several cell types. In the present study, we examined 
the ability of hemin on inducing cell differentiation and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) 
channel activity in erythroleukemic K562 cells. Treating undifferentiated K562 
cells with hemin (0.1 mM) for five days caused these cells to display 
differentiation-like characteristics including chromatin aggregation, nuclear 
degradation, pseudopod extension of the membrane and increased hemoglobin 
production. However, overall cell viability was not significantly changed by the 
presence of hemin. After hemin treatment for different periods, the 
Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel was activated by the addition of ionomycin (1 
microM), and was inhibited by either clotrimazole, charybdotoxin, or EGTA. 
Before hemin treatment there was no significant Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel 
activity present in undifferentiated K562 cells. After hemin treatment for 5 
days, a significant Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity was detected. This 
increasing Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity may be contributed from a 
subtype of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel, KCNN4. These results suggest that the 
ability of hemin to induce increasing Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity may 
contribute to the mechanism of hemin-induced K562 cell differentiation.

Author information:
(1)Vascular Institute of the Northwest, 1600 E. Jefferson St., Suite 101, 
Seattle, WA 98122, USA. kaj.johansen@swedish.org

PURPOSE: To evaluate prosthetic femoral-popliteal (FP) grafts as bypass conduits 
in favorable patients with refractory calf claudication.
SETTING: University-affiliated urban teaching hospital.
METHODS: Cohort study of patency of 6-mm Dacron FP grafts used to treat patients 
with medically refractory calf claudication meeting the following criteria: 
nonsmoker; above-knee popliteal artery as an appropriate target vessel; > or 
=2-vessel tibial outflow; and postoperative anticoagulation and antiplatelet 
therapy. End points included primary and secondary FP graft patency, need for 
and outcome of subsequent intervention, limb amputation, and survival.
RESULTS: From January 1998 through March 2001, 92 patients underwent 100 Dacron 
bypass grafts for medically refractory claudication. All underwent serial 
postoperative graft surveillance using duplex ultrasound. Using the Society for 
Vascular Surgery/International Society of Cardiovascular Surgery criteria 
life-table, primary patency was 84%, assisted primary patency was 88%, and 
secondary patency was 90% at 5 years. Two patients (2%) died during a mean 
follow-up period of 49 months (range 30 to 68). No limbs required amputation. 
Among 9 limbs in which Dacron FP bypass failed, 8 underwent subsequent 
successful autogenous bypass to the popliteal artery.
CONCLUSION: In highly selected subjects with favorable features known to 
increase the likelihood of prosthetic graft patency, prosthetic FP grafts 
function well. Such patients undergo a simpler, more straightforward procedure 
than when autogenous FP bypass is performed. Subsequent success of autogenous FP 
repeat bypass suggests that previous prosthetic FP bypass does not threaten 
lower-extremity arterial outflow.

Turner's syndrome (TS) is a genetic anomaly that results from complete or 
partial absence of one X chromosome and is the most commonly occurring 
chromosomal abnormality in females. While most females with TS present at birth 
or in early childhood, nearly one quarter present at adult services with primary 
or secondary amenorrhoea. It is only with the advent of clinics dedicated to 
adults with TS that we have realised the degree of occult pathology present in 
this group. Adults with TS are thought to have a reduced life expectancy, mainly 
due to excess cardiovascular risk, but they may also have multiple comorbidities 
including hypothyroidism, deafness, osteoporosis and the attendant problems of 
oestrogen deficiency and infertility. Many of these features may be affected by 
the timing of treatments in paediatrics - particularly the timing of growth 
hormone (GH) and oestrogen use. It is the role of adult TS services to audit the 
outcome of TS and to inform their paediatric colleagues of the long-term effects 
of childhood treatments. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach to focused adult 
care is needed, with consideration of how to optimise surveillance strategies in 
these women.

The place of pegvisomant in the acromegaly treatment algorithm.

Paisley AN(1), Trainer PJ, Drake WM.

The disfiguring disease acromegaly results from hypersecretion of growth hormone 
(GH). The main goals of treatment for acromegaly include normalisation of 
biochemical markers of disease activity to restore normal life expectancy, 
amelioration of signs and symptoms of the disease, removal of the pituitary 
tumour without damaging the optic chiasm and other peripituitary structures, and 
preservation of pituitary function. Conventional options for treatment of 
acromegaly include surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and medical therapy with either 
dopamine agonists or somatostatin (SMS) analogues. The advent of the genetically 
engineered growth hormone analogue pegvisomant is unlikely to alter 
significantly the place of surgery and RT in the treatment algorithm for 
acromegaly biochemical control as determined based on serum IGF-I concentrations 
is achievable with pegvisomant in virtually all patients, and it will clearly 
become the drug of choice in patients partially or completely unresponsive to 
SMS analogues. Preliminary studies suggest improved insulin sensitivity for a 
given IGF-I with pegvisomant compared with SMS analogues; if these results are 
confirmed by results of future studies, such a metabolic advantage may encourage 
the use of pegvisomant.

The case for negative senescence.

Negative senescence is characterized by a decline in mortality with age after 
reproductive maturity, generally accompanied by an increase in fecundity. 
Hamilton (1966) ruled out negative senescence: we adumbrate the deficiencies of 
his model. We review empirical studies of various plants and some kinds of 
animals that may experience negative senescence and conclude that negative 
senescence may be widespread, especially in indeterminate-growth species for 
which size and fertility increase with age. We develop optimization models of 
life-history strategies that demonstrate that negative senescence is 
theoretically possible. More generally, our models contribute to understanding 
of the evolutionary and demographic forces that mold the age-trajectories of 
mortality, fertility and growth.

Estimating national disability risk.

CA 94305-5020, USA. nli@demogr.mpg.de

In this article, I provide a method to rebuild the active and disabled life 
expectancy (ALE and DLE) on the basis of 'current' death and disability risks, 
and to measure disability risk. This method uses national-level data, and is 
based on two main assumptions. The first is the Gompertz assumption that death 
rate rises with age exponentially, and the second is the Cox assumption that 
death rates of active status are proportional to those of disabled status across 
age. Applying this method to the US data, I find that the disability risk has 
increased between 1970 and 1990 for both men and women aged 40 and older. 
Situations in which above assumptions could be removed are also discussed.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with intact or highly restrictive atrial septum: 
outcome after neonatal transcatheter atrial septostomy.

Medical School, Boston, Mass, USA.

BACKGROUND: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with intact or very 
restrictive atrial septum is a highly lethal combination. We review our 13-year 
institutional experience treating this high-risk subgroup of patients with 
emergent catheter therapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Infants with HLHS requiring catheter septostomy within the 
first 2 days of life were compared with a matched control group with adequate 
interatrial communication. Preoperative, early postoperative, and medium-term 
survival were evaluated. Earlier experience was compared with recent results to 
assess the effect of changes in catheterization and surgical and intensive care 
unit management strategies over the study period. From 1990 to 2002, 33 newborns 
with HLHS (11% of newborns with HLHS managed during this period) underwent 
urgent/semiurgent catheterization to create or enlarge an interatrial 
communication before surgical palliation. Preoperative and early postoperative 
mortality were high (48%) compared with control HLHS patients, regardless of 
prenatal diagnosis and despite successful catheter-based atrial septostomy with 
clinical stabilization. Mortality trended down during the later part of the 
study period. Those who survived the neonatal period had late survival, 
pulmonary artery pressure, and resistance similar to those of control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal mortality in the subgroup of HLHS patients with intact or 
highly restrictive atrial septum remains high despite successful urgent 
septostomy. Persistently poor outcomes for these patients have prompted efforts 
at our center to develop techniques for fetal intervention for this condition, 
in the hope that prenatal relief of left atrial and pulmonary venous 
hypertension may promote normal pulmonary vascular and parenchymal development 
and improve both short- and long-term outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have a reduced life 
expectancy mainly as the result of cardiovascular diseases. Relaxin has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. We analyzed the 
impact of relaxin on death in patients with ESKD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n =245; 122 women, 123 men) on long-term 
hemodialysis were followed for 1140 days for death. Blood samples for analysis 
of relaxin, C-reactive protein, Troponin T, cholesterol, HDL, brain natriuretic 
peptide, and albumin were taken at study entry. Survival was compared by the 
Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. One hundred seven patients died 
during the observation period; 66 died of cardiovascular diseases and 28 died of 
infectious diseases. Elevated serum relaxin concentrations (greater than median) 
predicted death in male but not in female patients with ESKD: All-cause death 
(men: relative risk, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.34 to 5.12; P=0.005; women: relative risk, 
0.671; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.35; P=0.262) and cardiovascular death (men: relative 
risk, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.20 to 7.21; P=0.018; women: relative risk, 0.639; 95% CI, 
0.26 to 1.56; P=0.324).
CONCLUSIONS: Relaxin is an independent risk factor predicting death in male 
patients with ESKD on chronic hemodialysis.

[Health promotion in traditional Chinese medicine: preventive treatment of a 
disease].

[Article in Chinese]

Chang SH(1), Wang HH.

Taiwan, ROC.

Preventive treatment is the highest form of traditional Chinese medicine. 
Ancient physicians believed that prevention was better than cure and health 
preservation was the best method for prolonging one's own life. At the same time 
as medical technology advances constantly and average life expectancy increases 
every few years, chronic diseases are also becoming more common. Ever since the 
World Health Organization proclaimed the year 2000 the year of "Health for all," 
the term has been a watchword for all developed countries. In traditional 
medicine, from the concept of preventive treatment to the method and practice of 
health preservation, there is much for nursing professionals involved in health 
promotion to tap into.

Importance of establishing quality control in health care system was given in 
this paper. It is necessary to standardize the protocols in any kind of medical 
treatment. Only main protocols and guidelines allow us to compare its usefulness 
in everyday practice doctors, medical teams and medical institutions. First, it 
is necessary to calculate life expectancy tables for population to whom health 
care system is established. Than, collecting of the data should be 
systematically performed by health care providers. So, if we use guidelines and 
standardized protocols in everyday practice we could compare medical work and 
with other countries which are in our interest.

bzhang@specialtylabs.com

Several relatively rare genetic diseases are found at greater frequencies in 
Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Most of these conditions are untreatable and 
shorten life expectancy. Genetic screening using molecular detection of a few 
common mutations for each of these diseases facilitates their prevention by 
identification of carrier couples. Conversely, couples with negative results are 
reassured by reduced carrier risks. Using a standardized format, a brief 
overview for each of the nine genetic diseases is presented. Known mutations, a 
short clinical summary, clinical and laboratory diagnostic methods and 
information on supportive treatments is provided for each. Finally, a brief 
discussion of available DNA testing technologies and a review of platforms for 
expanded testing options for Ashkenazi Jewish diseases under development are 
presented.

The aim of this paper is to compare a service offering genetic testing and 
presymptomatic surveillance to women at increased risk of developing breast 
cancer with its predecessor of no service at all in terms of survival and 
quality-adjusted survival (QALYs) by means of a Markov cohort chain simulation 
model. Genetic assessment and presymptomatic care provided between 0.07-1.61 
mean additional life years and 0.05-1.67 mean QALYs over no services. 
Prophylactic surgery and surveillance extended mean life expectancy by 0.41-1.61 
and 0.32-0.99 years, respectively over no services for high-risk women. Model 
outcomes were sensitive to all the parameters varied in the sensitivity 
analysis. Providing cancer genetic services increase survival and as long as 
services do not induce adverse psychological effects they also provide more 
QALYs. The greatest survival and QALY benefits were found for women with 
identified mutations. As more cancer genes are identified, the survival and 
cost-effectiveness of genetic services will improve. Although mastectomy 
provided most additional life years, when quality of life was accounted for 
oophorectomy was the optimal strategy. Delayed entry into coordinated genetic 
services was found to diminish the average survival and QALY gains for a woman 
utilising these services.

Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M4 N 3M5, Canada. toni.barnes@tsrcc.on.ca

GOALS: The rapid response radiotherapy program (RRRP) at Toronto-Sunnybrook 
Regional Cancer Center (TSRCC) provides quick access to palliative radiotherapy 
for patients with a life expectancy of less than 12 months. Patients then return 
to their referring physician for continued oncologic management. After the 
initial RRRP consultation, we fax an interim consultation report to the 
referring physician. The purpose of this study was to assess how useful 
referring physicians perceive this interim report and whether this report needs 
to be modified to meet their information needs.
METHODS: Physicians who referred patients to the RRRP and who were faxed an 
interim consultation report were identified over a 4-month period. These 
physicians were then faxed a questionnaire that asked how useful the interim 
report was in patient management, about their satisfaction with the information 
provided, to critique the report format, and whether the RRRP physician and 
nurse were easily accessible by telephone.
MAIN RESULTS: Forty physicians referred patients to the RRRP clinic over the 
4-month study period. The response rate to our survey was 58% (23/40). The vast 
majority of physicians (95%) stated that the interim consultation report was 
useful in patient management. They felt that treatment details were adequately 
discussed in the report. The report format was perceived to be clear and 
concise. Referring physicians wished to be informed about any medication 
changes. RRRP physicians and nurse were perceived to be easily accessible by 
telephone if needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that referring physicians found the faxed interim 
consultation report useful in patient management. Suggestions were made on how 
to improve the report, and they will be used to further enhance physician 
communication and ultimately patient care.

Comparison of health-related quality of life preferences between physicians and 
cirrhotic patients: implications for cost-utility analyses in chronic liver 
disease.

Wells CD(1), Murrill WB, Arguedas MR.

Alabama, USA.

Accurate assessment of utilities to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy 
for medical interventions is needed in cirrhosis. To date, limited data exist in 
cirrhotics and are generally physician-assigned. Therefore, our aim was to 
determine utilities for six clinical scenarios in cirrhosis and to define if 
differences exist in utilities assigned by physicians versus patients. We 
administered a questionnaire to 83 physicians and 114 cirrhotics to obtain 
utilities using the time trade-off method for (1) compensated cirrhosis, (2) 
decompensated cirrhosis, (3) encephalopathy, (4) spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis, (5) variceal bleeding, and (5) hepatocellular carcinoma. On a scale 
from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health), mean utilities of physicians and patients 
were compared using the Student t test. One-way analysis of variance was used to 
compare the utilities between patients according to Child-Pugh class. 
Statistical significance was defined as a P value <0.05. The mean age of the 
physicians was 42 +/- 11, with 52% being male. The mean age of the patients was 
52 +/- 9; with 59% male. The mean Child-Pugh score was 8 +/- 2 and HCV was the 
most common etiology (54%). The mean utilities for physicians and patients were 
as follows: CC, 0.78 vs. 0.88; DC, 0.55 vs. 0.74; E, 0.38 vs. 0.55; SBP, 0.33 
vs. 0.45; VB, 0.27 vs. 0.40; and HCC, 0.19 vs. 0.30. All comparisons were 
statistically significant. Although physicians and patients assigned similar 
relative rankings to each health state, physicians assigned utilities were 
significantly different from those assigned by patients. These results suggest 
that studies that have used physician-assigned utilities do not accurately 
reflect patient preferences.

Regularized autoregressive analysis of intravascular ultrasound backscatter: 
improvement in spatial accuracy of tissue maps.

Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

Autoregressive (AR) models are qualified for analysis of stochastic, short-time 
data, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) backscatter. Regularization is 
required for AR analysis of short data lengths with an aim to increase spatial 
accuracy of predicted plaque composition and was achieved by determining 
suitable AR orders for short data records. Conventional methods of determining 
order were compared to the use of trend in the mean square error for determining 
order. Radio-frequency data from 101 fibrous, 56 fibro-lipidic, 50 calcified, 
and 70 lipid-core regions of interest (ROIs) were collected ex vivo from 51 
human coronary arteries with 30 MHz unfocused IVUS transducers. Spectra were 
computed for AR model orders between 3-20 for data representing ROIs of two 
sizes (32 and 16 samples at 100 MHz sampling frequency) and were analyzed in the 
17-42 MHz bandwidth. These spectra were characterized based on eight previously 
identified parameters. Statistical classification schemes were computed from 75% 
of the data and cross-validated with the remaining 25% using matched histology. 
The results determined the suitable AR order numbers for the two ROI sizes. 
Conventional methods of determining order did not perform well. Trend in the 
mean square error was identified as the most suitable factor for regularization 
of short record lengths.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of disease and injury for the Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal populations in the Northern Territory.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of Northern Territory data for 1 January 1994 to 30 
December 1998 from multiple sources.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age, sex, 
cause and Aboriginality.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular disease was the leading contributor (14.9%) to the total 
burden of disease and injury in the NT, followed by mental disorders (14.5%) and 
malignant neoplasms (11.2%). There was also a substantial contribution from 
unintentional injury (10.4%) and intentional injury (4.9%). Overall, the NT
