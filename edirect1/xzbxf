BACKGROUND: Current US cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate 
recommendations based on a woman's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination 
status. Changes to cervical cancer screening policies in HPV-vaccinated women 
should be evaluated.
METHODS: We utilized an individual-based mathematical model of HPV and cervical 
cancer in US women to project the health benefits, costs, and harms associated 
with screening strategies in women vaccinated with the bivalent, quadrivalent, 
or nonavalent vaccine. Strategies varied by the primary screening test, 
including cytology, HPV, and combined cytology and HPV "cotesting"; age of 
screening initiation and/or switching to a new test; and interval between 
routine screens. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal 
perspective to identify screening strategies that would be considered good value 
for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Among women fully vaccinated with the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, 
optimal screening strategies involved either cytology or HPV testing alone every 
five years starting at age 25 or 30 years, with cost-effectiveness ratios 
ranging from $34 680 to $138 560 per QALY gained. Screening earlier or more 
frequently was either not cost-effective or associated with exceedingly high 
cost-effectiveness ratios. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine, only 
primary HPV testing was efficient, involving decreased frequency (ie, every 10 
years) starting at either age 35 years ($40 210 per QALY) or age 30 years ($127 
010 per QALY); with lower nonavalent vaccine efficacy, 10-year HPV testing 
starting at earlier ages of 25 or 30 years was optimal. Importantly, current US 
guidelines for screening were inefficient in HPV-vaccinated women.
CONCLUSIONS: This model-based analysis suggests screening can be modified to 
start at later ages, occur at decreased frequency, and involve primary HPV 
testing in HPV-vaccinated women, providing more health benefit at lower harms 
and costs than current screening guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) 
compared to other communicable diseases is an ongoing challenge given the need 
for good quality data on the incidence of these infections and the involved 
comorbidities. Based on the methodology of the Burden of Communicable Diseases 
in Europe (BCoDE) project and 2011-2012 data from the European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) point prevalence survey (PPS) of HAIs and 
antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals, we estimated the burden of 
six common HAIs.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The included HAIs were healthcare-associated pneumonia 
(HAP), healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (HA UTI), surgical site 
infection (SSI), healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection (HA CDI), 
healthcare-associated neonatal sepsis, and healthcare-associated primary 
bloodstream infection (HA primary BSI). The burden of these HAIs was measured in 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Evidence relating to the disease 
progression pathway of each type of HAI was collected through systematic 
literature reviews, in order to estimate the risks attributable to HAIs. For 
each of the six HAIs, gender and age group prevalence from the ECDC PPS was 
converted into incidence rates by applying the Rhame and Sudderth formula. We 
adjusted for reduced life expectancy within the hospital population using three 
severity groups based on McCabe score data from the ECDC PPS. We estimated that 
2,609,911 new cases of HAI occur every year in the European Union and European 
Economic Area (EU/EEA). The cumulative burden of the six HAIs was estimated at 
501 DALYs per 100,000 general population each year in EU/EEA. HAP and HA primary 
BSI were associated with the highest burden and represented more than 60% of the 
total burden, with 169 and 145 DALYs per 100,000 total population, respectively. 
HA UTI, SSI, HA CDI, and HA primary BSI ranked as the third to sixth syndromes 
in terms of burden of disease. HAP and HA primary BSI were associated with the 
highest burden because of their high severity. The cumulative burden of the six 
HAIs was higher than the total burden of all other 32 communicable diseases 
included in the BCoDE 2009-2013 study. The main limitations of the study are the 
variability in the parameter estimates, in particular the disease models' case 
fatalities, and the use of the Rhame and Sudderth formula for estimating 
incident number of cases from prevalence data.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated the EU/EEA burden of HAIs in DALYs in 2011-2012 using 
a transparent and evidence-based approach that allows for combining estimates of 
morbidity and of mortality in order to compare with other diseases and to inform 
a comprehensive ranking suitable for prioritization. Our results highlight the 
high burden of HAIs and the need for increased efforts for their prevention and 
control. Furthermore, our model should allow for estimations of the potential 
benefit of preventive measures on the burden of HAIs in the EU/EEA.

BACKGROUND: Timely initiation of breastfeeding within one hour after birth and 
exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of infant life 
along with continuation of breastfeeding up to two years. Timely initiation of 
breastfeeding has the potential to prevent 22 % of neonatal deaths. The 
objective of this study was to assess timely initiation of breastfeeding and 
associated factors among mothers who have infants less than six months of age in 
Motta town, East Gojjam, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.
METHOD: Community based quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted from 
April 7, 2015 to May 7, 2015. Simple random sampling technique was applied after 
taking all registered mothers who have infants less than 6 months old from local 
health extension workers of each kebele. A total of 423 mothers with infant less 
than six month old were included in this study. The data was collected from all 
four Kebeles using interviewer administered questionnaire. Descriptive and 
inferential statistics were used to present the data. Both bivariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors 
associated with timely initiation breastfeeding.
RESULT: Prevalence of timely initiation of breastfeeding was78.8 % [95 % CL: 
74.88 %, 82.72 %]. Mothers who gave birth to their infant in a health 
institution [AOR = 3.486(1.253, 9.700)], birthed vaginally [AOR = 5.722(3.134, 
11.246)] and didn't give prelacteal food [AOR = 4.627(2.095, 10.220)] were more 
likely to initiate breastfeeding early than their counterparts.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of timely initiation of breastfeeding in the study area 
was 78.8 %. Place of delivery, mode of delivery and prelactal feeding were the 
independent predictors of timely initiation of breastfeeding. Recommendations to 
increase timely initiation of breastfeeding were: encouraging mothers to deliver 
their child in a health institution, minimizing caesarean delivery as much as 
possible and educating mothers and community as a whole to avoid traditional 
prelactal feeding practice.

BACKGROUND: Mental illness is a substantial and rising contributor to the global 
burden of disease. Access to and utilization of mental health care, however, is 
limited by structural barriers such as specialist availability, time, 
out-of-pocket costs, and attitudinal barriers including stigma. Innovative 
solutions like virtual care are rapidly entering the health care domain. The 
advancement and adoption of virtual care for mental health, however, often 
occurs in the absence of rigorous evaluation and adequate planning for 
sustainability and spread.
METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a nested comparative 
effectiveness arm, and concurrent realist process evaluation to examine 
acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the Big White Wall (BWW) 
online platform for mental health self-management and peer support among 
individuals aged 16 and older who are accessing mental health services in 
Ontario, Canada. Participants will be randomized to 3 months of BWW or treatment 
as usual. At the end of the 3 months, participants in the intervention group 
will have the opportunity to opt-in to an intervention extension arm. Those who 
opt-in will be randomized to receive an additional 3 months of BWW or no 
additional intervention. The primary outcome is recovery at 3 months as measured 
by the Recovery Assessment Scale-revised (RAS-r). Secondary outcomes include 
symptoms of depression and anxiety measured with the Personal Health 
Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
Questionnaire-7 item (GAD-7) respectively, quality of life measured with the 
EQ-5D-5L, and community integration assessed with the Community Integration 
Questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness evaluations will account for the cost of the 
intervention and direct health care costs. Qualitative interviews with 
participants and stakeholders will be conducted throughout.
DISCUSSION: Understanding the impact of virtual strategies, such as BWW, on 
patient outcomes and experience, and health system costs is essential for 
informing whether and how health system decision-makers can support these 
strategies system-wide. This requires clear evidence of effectiveness and an 
understanding of how the intervention works, for whom, and under what 
circumstances. This study will produce such effectiveness data for BWW, while 
simultaneously exploring the characteristics and experiences of users for whom 
this and similar online interventions could be helpful.

HIV and aging.

    Int J Infect Dis. 2016 Dec;53:59-60.

With the wider availability of antiretrovirals, the world's HIV population is 
aging. More than 10% of the 34.5 million HIV-positive individuals worldwide are 
over the age of 50 years and the average age continues to increase. In the USA 
more than 50% of the 1.3 million people with HIV are over 50 years old and by 
the year 2030 it is estimated that 70% will be over the age of 50 years. 
Although the life expectancy of HIV-positive people has increased dramatically, 
it still lags behind that of HIV-negative individuals. There is controversy 
about whether HIV itself accelerates the aging process. Elevated rates of 
inflammation seen in people with HIV, even if their viral loads are suppressed 
and their CD4 counts are preserved, are associated with greater rates of 
cardiovascular, renal, neurocognitive, oncological, and osteoporotic disease. 
These conditions increase exponentially in the elderly and will represent a 
major challenge for HIV patients. In addition, conditions such as geriatric 
syndromes including frailty are also seen at higher rates. Management of the 
aging HIV patient includes an emphasis on early diagnosis and treatment, 
preventative measures for co-morbidities, and avoiding polypharmacy. Finally, 
the issue of quality of life, prioritization of medical issues, and end of life 
care become increasingly important as the patient grows older.

Background: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has extended the life 
expectancy of patients with HIV/AIDS to approach that of the general population. 
However, it remains unclear whether HIV infection affects the survival of 
patients with lymphoma in the HAART era.Methods: Patients diagnosed with Hodgkin 
lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma, peripheral 
T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), or follicular lymphoma during 2004-2011 were identified 
from the National Cancer Database. Survival analyses were conducted, where each 
HIV-infected patient was propensity score matched to a HIV-uninfected patient on 
the basis of demographic factors, clinical features, and treatment 
characteristics.Results: Among 179,520 patients, the prevalence of HIV-infection 
ranged from 1.0% for follicular lymphoma, 3.3% for PTCL, 4.7% for Hodgkin 
lymphoma, 5.4% for DLBCL, to 29% for Burkitt lymphoma. HIV infection was 
significantly associated with inferior overall survival for patients with each 
lymphoma subtype: Hodgkin lymphoma [HR, 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.25-1.74], DLBCL (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.80-2.11), Burkitt lymphoma (HR, 1.46; 95% 
CI, 1.24-1.73), PTCL (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14-1.79), and follicular lymphoma (HR, 
1.44; 95% CI, 1.04-2.00).Conclusions: HIV/AIDS continues to be independently 
associated with increased risk of death among patients with lymphoma in the 
HAART era in the United States, and the association varies by lymphoma 
histologic subtype.Impact: Examination of effective management strategies for 
patients with HIV/AIDS-associated lymphoma and enrollment of patients in 
prospective clinical trials are needed to improve patient outcomes. Cancer

BACKGROUND: Rising life expectancy means an increase in the number of elderly 
people with hearing loss in the population. Many elderly people live in nursing 
homes, with varying care needs. A substantial proportion of these people will 
need help with their hearing aids and other hearing devices.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study has been to assess the knowledge, 
experience, skills, competence, and need for information of staff at nursing 
homes in relation to residents' hearing loss and hearing aids.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five employees at seven nursing 
homes participated in the study. The main approach was a descriptive study, 
using questionnaires.
RESULTS: The main findings are that 73% of informants found that many residents 
need help with their hearing aids. Only one-tenth report that they know enough 
about the residents' hearing aids. Almost four out of five informants find that 
the residents become socially isolated as a result of hearing loss. 
Seventy-eight percent agree to some extent that more residents would benefit 
from hearing aids.
CONCLUSION: Staff at nursing homes have insufficient knowledge about hearing 
loss and hearing aids. Increased focus on the elderly with hearing impairment in 
nursing homes is needed. Contact between nursing homes and audiological 
specialists should be improved to best followup hearing loss and hearing aids.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects 1 % of the 
world's population, including 600,000 people in France. Persons with 
schizophrenia (PWS) have excess mortality (their life expectancy is reduced by 
20 %) and excess morbidity. In addition, such persons may have a large number of 
missing or decayed teeth. Dental caries and periodontal measurement indexes are 
often twice as high as the level found in the general population. Poor oral 
health can also affect quality of life and oral health is inseparable from 
general health. The management of oral health problems needs a multidisciplinary 
approach. According to the World Health Organization, the aim of therapeutic 
education (TE) is to help patients take care of themselves and to improve 
empowerment and recovery. In this educational approach, it is important to take 
into account the patient's personal experience. Though rarely investigated, the 
personal experience of PWS in oral health quality of life (OHRQoL) must be used 
to build a therapeutic educational programme in oral health (TEPOH) in a 
multidisciplinary approach, and the effectiveness of this program must be 
evaluated.
METHODS/DESIGN: We report the protocol of a randomized controlled cluster study. 
This study will be conducted in twelve hospitals in France. We hypothesized that 
a decrease of 20 % in the proportion of patients with CPI ≥ 3 would establish 
the effectiveness of TEPOH. Therefore, 12 hospitals will be randomly allocated 
to either TEPOH or no TEPOH. Altogether, they will have to recruit 230 PWS, who 
will be randomly allocated with a ratio of 1:1 to one of two conditions: control 
without intervention versus the group benefitting from TEPOH.
DISCUSSION: If successful, the study will generate methodologically sound 
results that provide knowledge on the effectiveness of a TEP in oral health for 
PWS. The results can be used to promote OHRQoL in a global health approach and 
develop appropriate strategies to encourage and facilitate financial support for 
healthcare, the multidisciplinary treatment of dental disorders, and the 
development of training in oral and mental health for caregivers. Trial

We present a case report of a successful pregnancy outcome in a woman diagnosed 
with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) hypermobility type or type III. EDS is a group 
of connective tissue disorders that has a common genotypic defect, but 
heterogeneous phenotypic presentations. The variation in EDS manifestations can 
result in moderate to severe effects on life-expectancy for some types. A number 
of studies and a review of the literature indicate that generally in pregnant 
women with EDS, maternal and neonatal outcomes are favourable. However, in EDS 
type IV, pregnancy can be associated with serious maternal complications. 
Therefore, obstetrical management should be individualized. This paper discusses 
the obstetric management of a patient with EDS hypermobility type and compares 
it to other studies in the literature.

The recommended intake of vitamin D-fortified dairy products can substantially 
decrease the burden of osteoporotic fractures and seems an economically 
beneficial strategy in the general French population aged over 60 years.
INTRODUCTION: This study aims to assess the public health and economic impact of 
vitamin D-fortified dairy products in the general French population aged over 
60 years.
METHODS: We estimated the lifetime health impacts expressed in number of 
fractures prevented, life years gained, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
gained of the recommended intake of dairy products in the general French 
population over 60 years for 1 year (2015). A validated microsimulation model 
was used to simulate three age cohorts for both women and men (60-69, 70-79, and 
>80 years). The incremental cost per QALY gained of vitamin D-fortified dairy 
products compared to the absence of appropriate intake was estimated in 
different populations, assuming the cost of two dairy products per day in base 
case.
RESULTS: The total lifetime number of fractures decreased by 64,932 for the 
recommended intake of dairy products in the general population over 60 years, of 
which 46,472 and 18,460 occurred in women and men, respectively. In particular, 
15,087 and 4413 hip fractures could be prevented in women and men. Vitamin 
D-fortified dairy products also resulted in 32,569 QALYs and 29,169 life years 
gained. The cost per QALY gained of appropriate dairy intake was estimated at 
€58,244 and fall below a threshold of €30,000 per QALY gained in women over 
70 years and in men over 80 years.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D-fortified dairy products have the potential to 
substantially reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures in France and seem an 
economically beneficial strategy, especially in the general population aged 
above 70 years.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Göteborg randomised population-based prostate 
cancer screening trial demonstrated that prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based 
screening reduces prostate cancer deaths compared with an age-matched control 
group. Utilising the prostate cancer detection rates from this study, we 
investigated the clinical and cost effectiveness of a similar PSA-based 
screening strategy for an Australian population of men aged 50-69 years.
METHODS: A decision model that incorporated Markov processes was developed from 
a health system perspective. The base-case scenario compared a population-based 
screening programme with current opportunistic screening practices. Costs, 
utility values, treatment patterns and background mortality rates were derived 
from Australian data. All costs were adjusted to reflect July 2015 Australian 
dollars (A$). An alternative scenario compared systematic with opportunistic 
screening but with optimisation of active surveillance (AS) uptake in both 
groups. A discount rate of 5 % for costs and benefits was utilised. Univariate 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of 
variable uncertainty on model outcomes.
RESULTS: Our model very closely replicated the number of deaths from both 
prostate cancer and background mortality in the Göteborg study. The incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for PSA screening was A$147,528. 
However, for years of life gained (LYGs), PSA-based screening (A$45,890/LYG) 
appeared more favourable. Our alternative scenario with optimised AS improved 
cost utility to A$45,881/QALY, with screening becoming cost effective at a 92 % 
AS uptake rate. Both modelled scenarios were most sensitive to the utility of 
patients before and after intervention, and the discount rate used.
CONCLUSION: PSA-based screening is not cost effective compared with Australia's 
assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY. It appears more cost 
effective if LYGs are used as the relevant outcome, and is more cost effective 
than the established Australian breast cancer screening programme on this basis. 
Optimised utilisation of AS increases the cost effectiveness of prostate cancer 
screening dramatically.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular therapy in addition to standard care 
(EVT+SC) has been demonstrated to be more effective than SC in acute ischemic 
large vessel occlusion stroke. Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness 
of EVT+SC depending on patients' initial National Institutes of Health Stroke 
Scale (NIHSS) score, time from symptom onset, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT 
Score (ASPECTS), and occlusion location.
METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with both strategies applied 
in a US setting. Model input parameters were obtained from the literature, 
including recently pooled outcome data of 5 randomized controlled trials (ESCAPE 
[Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Proximal Occlusion Ischemic Stroke], 
EXTEND-IA [Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological 
Deficits-Intra-Arterial], MR CLEAN [Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of 
Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands], REVASCAT 
[Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best 
Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation 
Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within 8 Hours of Symptom Onset], and SWIFT 
PRIME [Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular 
Treatment]). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate 
uncertainty of the model results. Net monetary benefits, incremental costs, 
incremental effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
derived from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The willingness-to-pay was 
set to $50 000/QALY.
RESULTS: Overall, EVT+SC was cost-effective compared with SC (incremental cost: 
$4938, incremental effectiveness: 1.59 QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio: $3110/QALY) in 100% of simulations. In all patient subgroups, EVT+SC led 
to gained QALYs (range: 0.47-2.12), and mean incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were considered cost-effective. However, subgroups with ASPECTS ≤5 or 
with M2 occlusions showed considerably higher incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios ($14 273/QALY and $28 812/QALY, respectively) and only reached suboptimal 
acceptability in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (75.5% and 59.4%, 
respectively). All other subgroups had acceptability rates of 90% to 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: EVT+SC is cost-effective in most subgroups. In patients with 
ASPECTS ≤5 or with M2 occlusions, cost-effectiveness remains uncertain based on 
current data.

BACKGROUND: Combined idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and emphysema (CPFE) 
has been reported to be more common in male smokers. A number of studies 
comparing CPFE patients with fibrosis-only patients have reported a similar 
prognosis while others have reported a significantly shorter survival.
OBJECTIVES: In present study, we aimed to compare baseline characteristics of 
patients with IPF according to emphysema presence. We asssessed the prognostic 
value of emphysema along with each other parameter.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, baseline radiological, 
laboratory and physiological parameters of 92 patients who were diagnosed with 
IPF. The patients were divided into two groups: those without emphysema (Group 
1) and with emphysema (Group 2). All-cause mortality was recorded, and the 
impact of the variables on survival was evaluated.
RESULTS: Emphysema was recorded in 23 patients, all of whom were male. While 
ever-smoker rate was higher in Group 2 laboratory and physiologic parameters 
were similar. Radiologically, the presence of honeycombing, ground glass 
opacity, the extension and symmetry of involvement did not differ between the 
Groups. The median survival time was 29±4 months. Patients in Group 1 and 2 had 
a median survival of 34 and 9 months, respectively. In univariate analysis; 
radiological presence of emphysema and honeycombing, male gender, lower baseline 
levels of albumin and oxygen saturation, forced vital capacity and carbon 
monoxide diffusing capacity were detected as predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: In present study, IPF with emphysema was more common in male 
smokers. When emphysema accompanies IPF, life expectancy is remarkably worse, 
but not independently so.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the needs for specialised rehabilitation provision in a 
cohort of neurosurgical patients; to determine if these were met, and to 
estimate the potential cost implications and cost-benefits of meeting any unmet 
rehabilitation needs.
METHODS: A prospective study of in-patient admissions to a regional 
neurosurgical ward. Assessment of needs for specialised rehabilitation (Category 
A or B needs) was made with the Patient Categorisation Tool. The number of 
patients who were referred and admitted for specialised rehabilitation was 
calculated. Data from the unit's submission to the UK Rehabilitation Outcomes 
Collaborative (UKROC) national clinical database 2012-2015 were used to estimate 
the potential mean lifetime savings generated through reduction in the costs of 
on-going care in the community.
RESULTS: Of 223 neurosurgical in-patients over 3 months, 156 (70%) had Category 
A or B needs. Out of the 105 patients who were eligible for admission to the 
local specialised rehabilitation service, only 20 (19%) were referred and just 
11 (10%) were actually admitted. The mean transfer time was 70.2 (range 28-127) 
days, compared with the national standard of 42 days. In the 3-year sample, mean 
savings in the cost of on-going care were £568 per week. Assuming a 10-year 
reduction in life expectancy, the approximate net lifetime saving for 
post-neurosurgical patients was estimated as at least £600K per patient. We 
calculated that provision of additional bed capacity in the specialist 
rehabilitation unit could generate net savings of £3.6M/bed-year.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary single-centre study identified a considerable gap 
in provision of specialised rehabilitation for neurosurgical patients, which 
must be addressed if patients are to fulfil their potential for recovery. A 
5-fold increase in bed capacity would cost £9.3m/year, but could lead to 
potential net savings of £24m/year. Our findings now require confirmation on a 
wider scale through prospective multi-centre studies.

Chromatin structure orchestrates the accessibility to the genetic material. 
Replication-independent histone variants control transcriptional plasticity in 
postmitotic cells. The life-long accumulation of these histones has been 
described, yet the implications on organismal aging remain elusive. Here, we 
study the importance of the histone variant H3.3 in Caenorhabditis elegans 
longevity pathways. We show that H3.3-deficient nematodes have negligible 
lifespan differences compared to wild-type animals. However, H3.3 is essential 
for the lifespan extension of C. elegans mutants in which pronounced 
transcriptional changes control longevity programs. Notably, H3.3 loss 
critically affects the expression of a very large number of genes in long-lived 
nematodes, resulting in transcriptional profiles similar to wild-type animals. 
We conclude that H3.3 positively contributes to diverse lifespan-extending 
signaling pathways, with potential implications on age-related processes in 
multicellular organisms.

BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of tobacco and the aging of the population, the 
incidence of lung cancer in the elderly rises. However, few elderly patients 
(older than 70 years old) with lung squamous cell carcinoma were involved into 
the clinical trials, which offered insufficient clinical evidence for these 
patients. Lung squamous cell carcinoma patients older than 80 years old were 
included in our study to analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment and 
prognostic factors, and to explore the optimal treatment choices for these 
patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of 38 elderly 
patients with lung squamous carcinoma and summarized the treatment under the 
clear diagnosis and clinical staging.
RESULTS: Elderly patients with squamous cell carcinoma can choose surgery, 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy based on diagnosis and clinical staging when their 
physical condition is permitted.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the short life expectancy of patients more than 80 years 
old, fewer of them could receive completed and effective treatment, comparing 
with patients between 70 and 80 years old.

BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is aggressive cancer, especially 
in adults as only 20-40% is cured with current treatment regimens.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate prognostic factors and their 
effects on survival in ALL patients in the Northeast of Iran.
METHODS: In a descriptive and retrospective study from 2009 to 2015, 48 ALL 
patients referred to hematology-oncology clinic. Age, sex, fever, blood group, 
type of ALL and consumption of amphotericin B, forms of cytogenetic, survival in 
the patients, WBC, hemoglobin, and platelet were checked in the first referral 
for every patient. The mean follow-up was 27.3 months in which 28 patients 
(59.3%) died. overall survival (OS) was plotted by GraphPad Prism 5 and the 
Log-rank test was used for analysis of survival with risk factors.
RESULTS: The mean age for all the ALL patients at diagnosis was 32.3 years 
(range, 15-71 years), and 81.3% were male. Of all patients, 62.5% had fever and 
25% consumed amphotericin B. 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year OS rates were 62.2%, 52.7%, 
40.6%, 39.1%, 22.2%, respectively. 75%, 29.2% and 39.6% of patients had WBC < 20 
× 103/μl, Hb < 7 g/dL and platelet < 30 × 103/μL, respectively. There was a 
significant difference in survival based on age (P = 0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, age > 35 years is the most prognostic factor 
in ALL patients. Also, patients who received amphotericin B had lower life 
expectancy because these patients were suffering from fungal infection or due to 
lack of response to antibacterial drugs, they have been treated with 
amphotericin B.

PURPOSE: We aim to evaluate the current beliefs and practice patterns of 
urologists in regard to use of cryosurgery for management of PCa.
METHODS: An anonymous 13-point survey was designed and sent out to members of 
the Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), Endourological Society (ES) and American 
College of Cryosurgery (ACC). Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses 
were used to determine variables associated with the use of cryosurgery.
RESULTS: Of the 206 responses received [81 (39.2 %) SUO; 106 (51.5 %) ES; 19 
(9.2 %) ACC], 83 (40.3 %) performed cryosurgery. The majority of respondents who 
utilize cryosurgery do so in unilateral (80.3 %) and bilateral (77.6 %) 
intermediate-risk PCa. Also, users of this technology indicated significant use 
in primary treatment (>72 %), salvage treatment (>83 %), in patients who prefer 
cryosurgery (89.9 %) have a life expectancy ≥10 years (65.8 %) and poor 
erections (74.7 %). The main reason for not utilizing cryosurgery was the lack 
of technical expertise (56.7 %). A urologist in a non-academic practice setting 
was 3.2 times more likely to perform cryosurgery compared to a urologist in an 
academic setting, p = 0.0001.
CONCLUSION: Cryosurgery is increasingly being accepted among urologists. 
However, the need for large-scale studies as well as randomized clinical trials 
to further delineate the benefits of cryosurgery and convince the non-users and 
institutions cannot be overemphasized.

Despite technological advances, the mortality rate for critically ill oldest old 
patients remains high. The intensive caring should be able to combine technology 
and a deep humanity considering that the patients are living the last part of 
their lives. In addition to the traditional goals of ICU of reducing morbidity 
and mortality, of maintaining organ functions and restoring health, caring for 
seriously oldest old patients should take into account their end-of-life 
preferences, the advance or proxy directives if available, the prognosis, the 
communication, their life expectancy and the impact of multimorbidity. The aim 
of this review was to focus on all these aspects with an emphasis on some 
intensive procedures such as mechanical ventilation, noninvasive mechanical 
ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, renal replacement therapy, 
hemodynamic support, evaluation of delirium and malnutrition in this 
heterogeneous frail ICU population.
