OBJECTIVES: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of 
connective tissue. The vascular complications of Marfan syndrome have the 
biggest impact on life expectancy. The aorta of Marfan patients reveals 
degradation of elastin layers caused by increased proteolytic activity of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we performed adenoviral gene transfer 
of human tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (hTIMP-1) in aortic 
grafts of fibrillin-1 deficient Marfan mice (mgR/mgR) in order to reduce 
elastolysis.
METHODS: We performed heterotopic infrarenal transplantation of the thoracic 
aorta in female mice (n = 7 per group). Before implantation, mgR/mgR and 
wild-type aortas (WT, C57BL/6) were transduced ex vivo with an adenoviral vector 
coding for human TIMP-1 (Ad.hTIMP-1) or β-galactosidase (Ad.β-Gal). As control 
mgR/mgR and wild-type aortas received no gene therapy. Thirty days after 
surgery, overexpression of the transgene was assessed by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and collagen in situ zymography. Histologic staining was performed to 
investigate inflammation, the neointimal index (NI), and elastin breaks. 
Endothelial barrier function of native not virus-exposed aortas was evaluated by 
perfusion of fluorescent albumin and examinations of virus-exposed tissue were 
performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
RESULTS: IHC and ISZ revealed sufficient expression of the transgene. Severe 
cellular inflammation and intima hyperplasia were seen only in adenovirus 
treated mgR/mgR aortas (Ad.β-Gal, Ad.hTIMP-1 NI: 0.23; 0.43), but not in native 
and Ad.hTIMP-1 treated WT (NI: 0.01; 0.00). Compared to native mgR/mgR and 
Ad.hTIMP-1 treated WT aorta, the NI is highly significant greater in Ad.hTIMP-1 
transduced mgR/mgR aorta (p = 0.001; p = 0.001). As expected, untreated Marfan 
grafts showed significant more elastolysis compared to WT (p = 0.001). However, 
elastolysis in Marfan aortas was not reduced by adenoviral overexpression of 
hTIMP-1 (compared to untreated Marfan aorta: Ad.hTIMP-1 p = 0.902; control 
Ad.β-Gal. p = 0.165). The virus-untreated and not transplanted mgR/mgR aorta 
revealed a significant increase of albumin diffusion through the endothelial 
barrier (p = 0.037). TEM analysis of adenovirus-exposed mgR/mgR aortas displayed 
disruption of the basement membrane and basolateral space.
CONCLUSIONS: Murine Marfan aortic grafts developed severe inflammation after 
adenoviral contact. We demonstrated that fibrillin-1 deficiency is associated 
with relevant dysfunction of the endothelial barrier that enables adenovirus to 
induce vessel-harming inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction may play a pivotal 
role in the development of the vascular phenotype of Marfan syndrome.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the USA. Moreover, 
hypertension affects approximately 78 million people in the USA and is a major 
modifiable risk factor. Therefore, elevated blood pressure is listed as the 
primary contributory cause of death in 15 % of the 2.4 million deaths in 2009. 
Nonetheless, 44 % of the hypertensive population in the USA did not have it 
under control in 2014. Hypertension cost was averaged to be 40-50 billion 
dollars yearly including medications and services and currently rising. New 
hypertension guidelines recommend treating individuals between ages 35 and 74 
with different stages of hypertension. Furthermore, individuals with existing 
co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes should have increased 
medication adherence and different blood pressure goal compared to those without 
co-morbidities. Studies utilizing quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs) were 
conducted to asses the cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated 
adults with hypertension. On average, treating adults between ages 35 to 74 
years could prevent about 50,000 and 13,000 cardiovascular events and deaths, 
respectively. Overall, treating stage 1 and 2 hypertension adults including 
emphasis on medication adherence could be effective and cost saving. The purpose 
of this article is to review different methods and assess cost-effectiveness for 
hypertension therapy based on the 2014 guidelines.

Enteral versus parenteral nutrition in cancer patients: evidences and 
controversies.

The debate over the use of enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) 
is an old but evergreen and hot topic. Since many years, studies comparing EN 
and PN have been a pivotal 'leitmotif' in the published literature on artificial 
nutrition (AN). Actually, there is a background misunderstanding in this debate; 
specifically, that EN and PN are competitors in the choice of the route for 
delivering nutrition support in cancer patients. Conversely, EN and PN have 
specific indications and contraindications. This review has the purpose to 
discuss the indications and complications as well as pros and cons of EN and PN 
in cancer patients, the crucial role of nutrition support in oncology patients 
during anticancer treatments and throughout the course of disease, and, finally, 
the role of AN in advanced cancer patients. In summary, we have no 
evidence-based data able to definitively indicate the optimal method for 
delivering AN in cancer patients. EN and PN have to be considered equally 
effective in maintaining or improving nutritional status in cancer patients. 
Besides, this review strongly supports the recommendation that a baseline 
nutritional assessment should be carried out by a healthcare professional expert 
in AN for all cancer patients at the time of diagnosis or anticancer treatment 
plan, taking the nutritional status, estimated duration of AN, AN-related 
potential benefits and possible complications into consideration on an 
individual basis. Moreover, the patient symptoms, performance status, estimated 
life expectancy, and mainly, will or preferences have to be evaluated and 
incorporated into the nutrition support plan before the definitive choice of the 
route for delivering nutrients is decided. Finally, applying a decision-making 
process tailored to patient needs-regardless of whether receiving or not 
anticancer treatment-allows to choose reasonably the optimal nutritional support 
strategy.

Recent scholarship offers different theories on how macrosocial determinants 
affect the population health of East and Southeast Asian nations. Dominant 
theories emphasize the effects of welfare regimes, welfare generosity, and labor 
market institutions. In this article, we conduct exploratory time-series 
cross-sectional analyses to generate new evidence on these theories while 
advancing a political explanation. Using unbalanced data of 7 East Asian 
countries and 11 Southeast Asian nations from 1960 to 2012, primary findings are 
3-fold. First, welfare generosity measured as education and health spending has 
a positive impact on life expectancy, net of GDP. Second, life expectancy varies 
significantly by labor markets; however, these differences are explained by 
differences in welfare generosity. Third, as East and Southeast Asian countries 
become more democratic, welfare generosity increases, and population health 
improves. This study provides new evidence on the value of considering politics, 
welfare states, and labor markets within the same conceptual framework.

The aim of this European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) survey was to collect 
data on the use of wearable cardioverter-defibrillators (WCDs) among members of 
the EHRA electrophysiology research network. Of the 50 responding centres, 23 
(47%) reported WCD use. Devices were fully reimbursed in 17 (43.6%) of 39 
respondents, and partially reimbursed in 3 centres (7.7%). Eleven out of 20 
centres (55%) reported acceptable patients' compliance (WCD worn for >90% of 
time). The most common indications for WCD (8 out of 10 centres; 80%) were 
covering the period until re-implantation of ICD explanted due to infection, in 
patients with left ventricular impairment due to myocarditis or recent 
myocardial infarction and those awaiting heart transplantation. Patient life 
expectancy of <12 months and poor compliance were the most commonly reported 
contraindications for WCD (24 of 46 centres, 52.2%). The major problems 
encountered by physicians managing patients with WCD were costs (8 of 18 
centres, 44.4%), non-compliance, and incorrect use of WCD. Four of 17 centres 
(23.5%) reported inappropriate WCD activations in <5% of patients. The first 
shock success rate in terminating ventricular arrhythmias was 95-100% in 6 of 15 
centres (40%), 85-95% in 4 (26.7%), 75-85% in 2 (13.3%), and <75% in 3 centres 
(20%). The survey has shown that the use of WCD in Europe is still restricted 
and depends on reimbursement. Patients' compliance remains low. Heterogeneity of 
indications for WCD among centres underscores the need for further research and 
a better definition of indications for WCD in specific patient groups.

Following considerable debate, the practice of euthanasia was legalized in 
Belgium in 2002, thereby making Belgium one of the few places in the world where 
this practice is legal. In 2014 the law was amended for the first time. The 2014 
amendment makes euthanasia legally possible for all minors who repeatedly and 
voluntarily request euthanasia and who are judged to possess "capacity of 
discernment" (regardless of their biological age), as well as fulfil a number of 
other criteria of due care. This extension of the 2002 euthanasia law generated 
a lot of national and international debate and has been applauded by many and 
heavily criticized by others. This evolution is clearly of interest to 
end-of-life debates in the entire world. This paper will therefore describe how 
this amendment came to get passed using official documents from Belgium's Senate 
and Chamber of Representatives where this amendment was discussed and 
subsequently passed. Next, some of the most commonly given arguments in favour 
of the law are identified, as well as the arguments most often voiced against 
the amendment. All these arguments will be expanded upon and it will be examined 
whether they hold up to ethical scrutiny. Analysing the official documents and 
identifying the most commonly voiced arguments gives valuable insight into how 
Belgium came to amend its euthanasia law and why it did so in 2014. It also 
becomes clear that although the current amendment is often seen as far-reaching, 
more radical ideas were proposed during the drafting of the law. Also, in 
analysing those arguments in favour of the amendment and those against, it is 
clear that the validity of some of these is questionable.

The improvement of life expectancy created more surgical candidates with severe 
symptomatic aortic stenosis and age >80. Therefore, the main objective of this 
observational, retrospective single-centre study is to compare the long-term 
survival of octogenarians that have undergone surgical aortic valve replacement 
(AVR) to the survival of the general population of the same age and to establish 
whether any perioperative characteristics can anticipate a poor long-term 
result, limiting the prognostic advantage of the procedure at this age. From 
2000 to 2014, 264 octogenarians underwent AVR at our institution. Perioperative 
data were retrieved from our institutional database and patients were followed 
up by telephonic interviews. The follow-up ranged between 2 months and 
14.9 years (mean 4.1 ± 3.1 years) and the completeness was 99.2 %. Logistic 
multivariate analysis and Cox regression were respectively applied to identify 
the risk factors of in-hospital mortality and follow-up survival. Our patient 
population ages ranged between 80 and 88 years. Isolated AVR (I-AVR) was 
performed in 136 patients (51.5 %) whereas combined AVR (C-AVR) in 128 patients 
(48.5 %). Elective procedures were 93.1 %. Logistic EuroSCORE was 15.4 ± 10.6. 
In-hospital mortality was 4.5 %. Predictive factors of in-hospital mortality 
were the non-elective priority of the procedure (OR 5.7, CI 1.28-25.7, 
p = 0.02), cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR 1.02, CI 1.01-1.03, p = 0.004) and 
age (OR 1.36, CI 1.01-1.84, p = 0.04). Follow-up survival at 1, 4, 8 and 
12 years was 93.4 % ± 1.6 %, 72.1 % ± 3.3 %, 39.1 % ± 4.8 % and 20.1 % ± 5.7 %, 
respectively. The long-term survival of these patients was not statistically 
different from the survival of an age/gender-matched general population living 
in the same geographic region (p = 0.52). Predictive factors of poor long-term 
survival were diabetes mellitus (HR 1.55, CI 1.01-2.46, p = 0.05), preoperative 
creatinine >200 μmol/L (HR 2.07, CI 1.21-3.53, p = 0.007) and preoperative 
atrial fibrillation (HR 1.79, CI 1.14-2.80, p = 0.01). In our experience, AVR 
can be safely performed in octogenarians. After a successful operation, the 
survival of these patients returns similar to the general population. 
Nevertheless, the preoperative presence of major comorbidities such as diabetes 
mellitus, renal dysfunction and atrial fibrillation significantly impact on 
long-term results.

The effects of asymmetric interactions on population dynamics has been widely 
investigated, but there has been little work aimed at understanding how life 
history parameters like generation time, life expectancy and the variance in 
lifetime reproductive success are impacted by different types of competition. We 
develop a new framework for incorporating trait-mediated density-dependence into 
size-structured models and use Trinidadian guppies to show how different types 
of competitive interactions impact life history parameters. Our results show the 
degree of symmetry in competitive interactions can have dramatic effects on the 
speed of the life history. For some vital rates, shifting the competitive 
superiority from small to large individuals resulted in a doubling of the 
generation time. Such large influences of competitive symmetry on the timescale 
of demographic processes, and hence evolution, highlights the interwoven nature 
of ecological and evolutionary processes and the importance of 
density-dependence in understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics.

BACKGROUND: This analysis models the cost-effectiveness of real-time continuous 
glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) using evidence from a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) that demonstrated RT-CGM reduced A1C, for up to 9 months after using the 
technology, among patients with type 2 diabetes not on prandial insulin. RT-CGM 
was offered short-term and intermittently as a self-care tool to inform 
patients' behavior.
METHOD: The analyses projected lifetime clinical and economic outcomes for 
RT-CGM versus self-monitoring of blood glucose by fingerstick only. The 
base-case analysis was consistent with the RCT (RT-CGM for 2 weeks on/1 week off 
over 3 months). A scenario analysis simulated outcomes of an RT-CGM "refresher" 
after the active intervention of the RCT. Analyses used the IMS CORE Diabetes 
Model and were conducted from a US third-party payer perspective, including 
direct costs obtained from published sources and inflated to 2011 US dollars. 
Costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum.
RESULTS: Life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) from 
RT-CGM were 0.10 and 0.07, with a cost of $653/patient over a lifetime. 
Incremental LE and QALE from a "refresher" were 0.14 and 0.10, with a cost of 
$1312/patient over a lifetime, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
$9319 and $13 030 per LY and QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: RT-CGM, as a self-care tool, is a cost-effective disease management 
option in the US for people with type 2 diabetes not on prandial insulin. 
Repeated use of RT-CGM may result in additional cost-effectiveness.

Population-Based Estimates of Decreases in Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy 
Associated with Unhealthy Body Mass Index.

OBJECTIVE: Being classified as outside the normal range for body mass index 
(BMI) has been associated with increased risk for chronic health conditions, 
poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and premature death. To assess the 
impact of BMI on HRQOL and mortality, we compared quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) by BMI levels.
METHODS: We obtained HRQOL data from the 1993-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System and life table estimates from the National Center for Health 
Statistics national mortality files to estimate QALE among U.S. adults by BMI 
categories: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m(2)), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 
kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)), obese (BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2)), and 
severely obese (BMI ≥35.0 kg/m(2)).
RESULTS: In 2010 in the United States, the highest estimated QALE for adults at 
18 years of age was 54.1 years for individuals classified as normal weight. The 
two lowest QALE estimates were for those classified as either underweight (48.9 
years) or severely obese (48.2 years). For individuals who were overweight or 
obese, the QALE estimates fell between those classified as either normal weight 
(54.1 years) or severely obese (48.2 years). The difference in QALE between 
adults classified as normal weight and those classified as either overweight or 
obese was significantly higher among women than among men, irrespective of 
race/ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Using population-based data, we found significant differences in 
QALE loss by BMI category. These findings are valuable for setting national and 
state targets to reduce health risks associated with severe obesity, and could 
be used for cost-effectiveness evaluations of weight-reduction interventions.

Rupture of distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysm presenting only subdural 
hemorrhage without subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report.

School, 42, Jebong-ro, Donggu, Gwangju, 501-757 Republic of Korea.

Intracranial aneurysm rupture usually manifests with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
often combined with intracerebral hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage 
extension. In rare cases, however, these aneurysms present only as subdural 
hematomas. Recently, we treated a 48-years-old female patient who presented only 
with subdural hematoma. Interestingly, she did not have a history of trauma. 
Computed tomography angiography and digital subtraction angiography revealed a 
5 × 3 mm sized aneurysm at the A3-A4 junction of the left anterior cerebral 
artery. On admission, emergency operation (clipping and hematoma evacuation) was 
performed to protect against re-bleeding. Along with postoperative intensive 
care, the patient returned to normal daily life with only a mild headache. Given 
that patients may present with atraumatic acute subdural hematoma, the clinician 
must bear in mind the possibility of intracranial vascular pathology and obtain 
angiographic scans to evaluate for any underlying conditions to prevent patient 
deaths.

BACKGROUND: BRCA2 mutation carriers are at increased risk for multiple cancers 
including pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC). Our goal was to compare the 
effectiveness of different PAC screening strategies in BRCA2 mutation carriers, 
from the standpoint of life expectancy.
METHODS: A previously published Markov model of PAC was updated and extended to 
incorporate key aspects of BRCA2 mutation carrier status, including competing 
risks of breast- and ovarian-cancer specific mortality. BRCA2 mutation carriers 
were modeled and analyzed as the primary cohort for the analysis. Additional 
higher risk BRCA2 cohorts that were stratified according to the number of 
first-degree relatives (FDRs) with PAC were also analyzed. For each cohort, 
one-time screening and annual screening were evaluated, with screening starting 
at age 50 in both strategies. The primary outcome was net gain in life 
expectancy (LE) compared to no screening. Sensitivity analysis was performed on 
key model parameters, including surgical mortality and MRI test performance.
FINDINGS: One-time screening at age 50 resulted in a LE gain of 3.9 days for the 
primary BRCA2 cohort, and a gain of 5.8 days for those with BRCA2 and one FDR. 
Annual screening resulted in LE loss of 12.9 days for the primary cohort and 1.3 
days for BRCA2 carriers with 1 FDR, but resulted in 20.6 days gained for 
carriers with 2 FDRs and 260 days gained for those with 3 FDRs. For patients 
with ≥ 3 FDRs, annual screening starting at an earlier age (i.e. 35-40) was 
optimal.
INTERPRETATION: Among BRCA2 mutation carriers, aggressive screening regimens may 
be ineffective unless additional indicators of elevated risk (e.g., 2 or more 
FDRs) are present. More clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings.

INTRODUCTION: Acute coronary syndrome is one of the most frequent medical 
emergencies in developing countries.
OBJECTIVE: To determine, from the perspective of the Colombian health system, 
the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel for the treatment 
of patients with acute coronary syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the 
perspective of the Colombian health system comparing ticagrelor and clopidogrel 
for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. To estimate the 
expected costs and outcomes, a Markov model was constructed in which patients 
could remain stable without experiencing new cardiovascular events, suffer from 
a new event, or die. For the baseline case, a 10-year time horizon and a 
discount ratio of 3% for costs and benefits were adopted. The transition 
probabilities were extracted from the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient 
Outcomes) clinical trial. Vital statistics were drawn from the Departmento 
Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) and additional information from 
Colombian patients included in the Access registry. To identify and measure 
resource use, a standard case was built by consulting guidelines and protocols. 
Unit costs were obtained from Colombian rate lists. A probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was conducted in which costs were represented by a triangular 
distribution, and the effectiveness through a beta distribution.
RESULTS: In the base case, the additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained with ticagrelor was COP$ 28,411,503. The results were sensitive to 
changes in the time horizon and the unit cost of clopidogrel. For a 
willingness-to-pay equivalent to three times the Colombian per capita gross 
domestic product, the probability of ticagrelor being cost-effective was 75%.
CONCLUSIONS: Ticagrelor is a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of 
patients with acute coronary syndrome in Colombia.

An increase in the exposure and predisposition of civilian populations to 
disasters has been recorded in the last decades. In major disasters, as 
demonstrated recently in Nepal (2015) and previously in Haiti (2010), external 
aid is vital, yet in the first hours after a disaster, communities must usually 
cope alone with the challenge of providing emergent lifesaving care. Communities 
therefore need to be prepared to handle emergency situations. Mapping the needs 
of the populations within their purview is a trying task for decision makers and 
community leaders. In this context, the elderly are traditionally treated as a 
susceptible population with special needs. The current study aimed to explore 
variations in the level of community resilience along the lifespan. The study 
was conducted in nine small to mid-size towns in Israel between August and 
November 2011 (N = 885). The Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment Measure 
(CCRAM), a validated instrument for community resilience assessment, was used to 
examine the association between age and community resilience score. Statistical 
analysis included spline and logistic regression models that explored community 
resiliency over the lifespan in a way that allowed flexible modeling of the 
curve without prior constraints. This innovative statistical approach 
facilitated identification of the ages at which trend changes occurred. The 
study found a significant rise in community resiliency scores in the age groups 
of 61-75 years as compared with younger age bands, suggesting that older people 
in good health may contribute positively to building community resiliency for 
crisis. Rather than focusing on the growing medical needs and years of 
dependency associated with increased life expectancy and the resulting climb in 
the proportion of elders in the population, this paper proposes that active 
"young at heart" older people can be a valuable resource for their community.

This research was aimed at estimating possible Coal workers' pneumoconiosis 
(CWP) cases as of 2012, and predicting future CWP cases among redeployed coal 
workers from the Fuxin Mining Industry Group. This study provided the scientific 
basis for regulations on CWP screening and diagnosis and labor insurance 
policies for redeployed coal workers of resource-exhausted mines. The study 
cohort included 19,116 coal workers. The cumulative incidence of CWP was 
calculated by the life-table method. Possible CWP cases by occupational category 
were estimated through the average annual incidence rate of CWP and males' life 
expectancy. It was estimated that 141 redeployed coal workers might have 
suffered from CWP as of 2012, and 221 redeployed coal workers could suffer from 
CWP in the future. It is crucial to establish a set of feasible and affordable 
regulations on CWP screening and diagnosis as well as labor insurance policies 
for redeployed coal workers of resource-exhausted coal mines in China.

BACKGROUND: In developed countries there are significant gender differences in 
lifetime expectancy that can be explained by behavioral risk factors (RF).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to estimate gender features of behavioral RF 
in general population of Saint-Petersburg, Russia.
METHODS: As a part of all-Russian epidemiology survey ESSE-RF a random sampling 
of 1600 Saint-Petersburg inhabitants (25-64 y.o.) stratified by age and sex was 
performed. All participants filled in the questionnaire. Anthropometry (weight, 
height, body-mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and fasting blood-tests 
(lipids, glucose by Abbott Architect 8000 (USA)) were performed.
RESULTS: There were examined 573 (36%) men and 1027 (64%) women. No gender 
differences in obesity were found according to BMI criteria--in 178 (31.2%) 
women and 352 (35.1%) men. Obesity was more often detected in females according 
to WC criteria: ATPIII--44.1 vs 30.3%; IDF 51.2 vs 66.4% (p < 0.001 for both). 
Linear regression analysis was performed and age was associated with BMI--1.6 
kg/m2/decade, WC in women--5.2 cm/decade and WC in men--2.8 cm/decade, p < 0.001 
for all anthropometric parameters. Optimal level of physical activity was 
equally documented in both genders--540 (61.2%) women and 286 (58.9%) men. Daily 
intake of sweets was lower in men--228 (39.8%) vs 539 (52.5%) in women (p < 
0.001). 810 (50.6%) of trial subjects were non-smokers, 395 (24.7%) were former 
smokers, and 395 (24.7%) were smokers at the moment of trial. The higher number 
of female smokers was observed--194 (19.1%).
CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of obesity is observed in sample of 
Saint-Petersburg inhabitants--it is higher among women according to WC criteria 
regardless of menopause, possibly due to bigger sweets consumption. Males smoke 
more often and consume less fresh fruits and vegetables which is accompanied by 
a higher prevalence of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

PURPOSE: People with severe mental illnesses (SMI) experience a 17- to 20-year 
reduction in life expectancy. One-third of deaths are due to cardiovascular 
disease. This study will establish the relationship of SMI with cardiovascular 
disease in ethnic minority groups (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black 
Caribbean, black African and Irish), in the UK.
METHODS: E-CHASM is a mixed methods study utilising data from 1.25 million 
electronic patient records. Secondary analysis of routine patient records will 
establish if differences in cause-specific mortality, cardiovascular disease 
prevalence and disparities in accessing healthcare for ethnic minority people 
living with SMI exist. A nested qualitative study will be used to assess 
barriers to accessing healthcare, both from the perspectives of service users 
and providers.
RESULTS: In primary care, 993,116 individuals, aged 18+, provided data from 
186/189 (98 %) practices in four inner-city boroughs (local government areas) in 
London. Prevalence of SMI according to primary care records, ranged from 1.3-1.7 
%, across boroughs. The primary care sample included Bangladeshi [n = 94,643 (10 
%)], Indian [n = 6086 (6 %)], Pakistani [n = 35,596 (4 %)], black Caribbean [n = 
45,013 (5 %)], black African [n = 75,454 (8 %)] and Irish people [n = 13,745 (1 
%)]. In the secondary care database, 12,432 individuals with SMI over 2007-2013 
contributed information; prevalent diagnoses were schizophrenia [n = 6805 (55 
%)], schizoaffective disorders [n = 1438 (12 %)] and bipolar affective disorder 
[n = 4112 (33 %)]. Largest ethnic minority groups in this sample were black 
Caribbean [1432 (12 %)] and black African (1393 (11 %)).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of research examining cardiovascular disease in 
minority ethnic groups with severe mental illnesses. The E-CHASM study will 
address this knowledge gap.

The introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has had a 
remarkable impact on the natural history of HIV infection, leading to a dramatic 
decline in the mortality rate and a considerable increase in the life expectancy 
of HIV-positive people. However, cART use is frequently associated with several 
metabolic complications, mostly represented by lipid metabolism alterations, 
which are reported very frequently among persons treated with antiretroviral 
agents. In particular, hyperlipidaemia occurs in up to 70%-80% of HIV-positive 
subjects receiving cART and is mainly associated with specific antiretroviral 
drugs belonging to three classes of antiretroviral agents: NRTIs, NNRTIs and 
PIs. The potential long-term consequences of cART-associated dyslipidaemia are 
not completely understood, but an increased risk of premature coronary heart 
disease has been reported in HIV-infected patients on cART, so prompt correction 
of lipid metabolism abnormalities is mandatory in this population. Dietary 
changes, regular aerobic exercise and switching to a different antiretroviral 
regimen associated with a more favourable metabolic profile are the first steps 
in clinical management, but lipid-lowering therapy with fibrates or statins is 
often required. In this case, the choice of hypolipidaemic drugs should take 
into account the potential pharmacokinetic interactions with many antiretroviral 
agents.

Obesity has become a major public health problem. Given the current increase in 
life expectancy, the prevalence of obesity also raises steadily among older age 
groups. The increase in life expectancy is often accompanied with additional 
years of susceptibility to chronic ill health associated with obesity in the 
elderly. Both obesity and ageing are conditions leading to serious health 
problems and increased risk for disease and death. Ageing is associated with an 
increase in abdominal obesity, a major contributor to insulin resistance and the 
metabolic syndrome. Obesity in the elderly is thus a serious concern and 
comprehension of the key mechanisms of ageing and age-related diseases has 
become a necessary matter. Here, we aimed to identify similarities underlying 
mechanisms related to both obesity and ageing. We bring together evidence that 
age-related changes in body fat distribution and metabolism might be key factors 
of a vicious cycle that can accelerate the ageing process and onset of 
age-related diseases.

Some studies indicate that calcium supplementation increases cardiovascular 
risk. We assessed whether such effects could counterbalance the fracture 
benefits from supplementation. Accounting for cardiovascular outcomes, calcium 
may cause net harm and would not be cost-effective. Clinicians may do well 
considering cardiovascular effects when prescribing calcium supplementation.
INTRODUCTION: Accounting for possible cardiovascular effect of calcium and 
vitamin D supplementation (CaD), the aims of this study were to assess whether 
CaD on balance would improve population health and to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of such supplementation.
METHODS: We created a probabilistic Markov simulation model that was analysed at 
the individual patient level. We analysed 65-year-old Norwegian women with a 
2.3 % 10-year risk of hip fracture and a 9.3 % risk of any major fracture 
according to the WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX®). Consistent with a 
recent Cochrane review, we assumed that CaD reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, 
and wrist fractures by 16, 11, and 5 %, respectively. We included the increased 
risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke under a no-, medium-, and 
high-risk scenario.
RESULTS: Assuming no cardiovascular effects, CaD supplementation produces 
improved health outcomes resulting in an incremental gain of 0.0223 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and increases costs by €322 compared with no 
treatment (cost-effectiveness ratio €14,453 per QALY gained). Assuming a 
Norwegian cost-effectiveness threshold of €60,000 per QALY, CaD is likely to be 
considered a cost-effective treatment alternative. In a scenario with a medium 
or high increased risk of cardiovascular events, CaD produces net health losses, 
respectively, -0.0572 and -0.0784 QALY at additional costs of €481 and €1033.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the magnitude of potential cardiovascular side 
effects is crucial for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CaD 
supplementation in elderly women.

PURPOSE: The moving rectangle method is used to disentangle the contributions of 
rectangularization and life span extension to the increase in life expectancy. 
It requires the choice of an endpoint of the survival curve that approaches the 
maximum age at death. We examined the effect of choosing different end points on 
the outcomes of this method.
METHODS: For five developed countries, survival curves from age 50 years were 
constructed per calendar year from 1922 onward. Survival values of 0.1, 0.01, 
and 0.001 were chosen as end points of the survival curve, and the contributions 
of rectangularization and life span extension to the increase in life expectancy 
were calculated using the moving rectangle method.
RESULTS: The choice of different survival values as end points profoundly 
influenced the estimated contributions of rectangularization and life span 
extension to the increase in life expectancy. When choosing 0.001, 
rectangularization contributed most years, whereas when choosing 0.1, life span 
extension contributed most years.
CONCLUSIONS: When the moving rectangle method is used to estimate the 
contributions of rectangularization and life span extension to the increase in 
life expectancy, its outcomes depend on the choice of the endpoint of the 
survival curve.
