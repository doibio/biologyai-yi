BACKGROUND: Patients with persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria have a high 
risk of kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular events. Recently, the maintenance 
of proteinuria remission has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidney 
endpoint. However, the effect of remission duration on cardiovascular outcomes 
remains unclear.
METHODS: This study enrolled 982 patients with primary nephrotic syndrome who 
had achieved clinical remission. Remission duration was defined as the 
maintenance time (months) of the first remission. Arteriosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and kidney dysfunction (ESKD or eGFR reduction 
>50%) were the endpoints. Survival curves, Cox regression models, restricted 
cubic spline analysis were used and the cutoff time points were determined.
RESULTS: During the 38.3 months of follow-up, 161 (16.4%) patients developed 
ASCVD (51.3 per 1000 patient-years) and 52 (5.3%) patients developed kidney 
dysfunction (15.3 per 1000 patient-years). Multivariate analysis showed that 
remission duration was an independently protective factor to ASCVD, in which 
each one-year extension associated with a 15% reduction of the risk (HR, 0.854; 
95% CI, 0.776 ∼ 0.940, p = .001). The initial time point was seven months for 
remission to present the protective effect to ASCVD and the maximum time point 
was 36 months. Remission duration was also an independently protective factor to 
kidney dysfunction. This effect was shown from the beginning of remission and 
reached the maximum at 26 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The maintenance of proteinuria remission was crucial for the 
improvement of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in nephrotic syndrome 
patients.

Synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores have been reported for their singlet 
state fluorescence properties and applications in bioimaging, but rarely for the 
triplet state chemistries. Herein, we enabled their photo-sensitizing and 
photo-crosslinking properties through rational modulations. Extension of 
molecular conjugation and introduction of heavy atoms promoted the generation of 
reactive oxygen species. Unlike other photosensitizers, these chromophores 
selectively photo-crosslinked aggregated proteins and uncovered the interactome 
profiles. We also exemplified their general applications in chromophore-assisted 
light inactivation, photodynamic therapy and photo induced polymerization. 
Theoretical calculation, pathway analysis and transient absorption spectroscopy 
provided mechanistic insights for this triplet state chemistry. Overall, this 
work expands the function and application of synthetic fluorescent protein 
chromophores by enabling their triplet excited state properties.

In the recent era, economic growth is not enough to represent sustainable 
development. Sustainable development has three dimensions (i.e., economic, 
social, and environment). This study estimated the economic, social, and 
environmental efficiency using data from 2000 to 2021. Input-oriented data 
envelopment analysis shows strong heterogeneity across developed (G-8) and 
developing countries (SAARC). There is a potential to increase economic and 
environmental efficiency in the G-8 and SAARC countries. The average economic 
efficiencies are 0.682 and 0.414, which implies the possibility of the same 
output (GDP/capita) by using 31.8% and 58.6% fewer inputs in G-8 and SAARC 
countries, respectively. The social efficiency score is more than 0.980 in both 
panels. The average environmental efficiencies are 0.712 and 0.724, which 
implies that selected countries can obtain the same output (CO2 emission 
reduction) by using 28.8% and 27.6% fewer inputs in G-8 and SAARC countries, 
respectively. The top three economically efficient countries are (a) the USA, 
the UK, and Japan in the G-8 panel and (b) Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan in 
the SAARC panel. The top three environmentally efficient countries are (a) 
France, the UK, and Italy in the G-8 panel and (b) Afghanistan, Nepal, and 
Bangladesh in the SAARC panel. It is recommended to adopt suitable policies to 
reduce emission, minimize waste, efficient utilization of resources, increase 
forest cover, and incentive for clean technologies. It is suggested to promote 
renewable energy through the provision of micro-credit to the poor, subsidizing 
renewable energy technologies, implementation of stringent environmental 
policies, and increasing awareness. It is essential to invest in eco-friendly 
and innovative technologies; thus, the government should encourage green 
practices in production. Human development is recommended to increase the living 
standard and healthy life. The government should invest in the health system and 
conduct seminars on general health awareness. Investment in basic infrastructure 
(drinking water, sanitation, and clean fuel) is essential to increase the living 
standard. The G-8 countries should provide financial and technological help to 
the SAARC countries.

Is life expectancy higher in countries and territories with publicly funded 
health care? Global analysis of health care access and the social determinants 
of health.

BACKGROUND: To better understand factors influencing life expectancy, this paper 
examines how the availability of publicly funded health care in a country and 
multiple social determinants of health impact longevity of life.
METHODS: In this descriptive statistical analysis, data regarding publicly 
funded health care, life expectancy, and social determinants of health were 
obtained for 196 countries and 4 territories. Social determinants included 10 
indicators detailing country-level information to represent 5 key categories: 
economic stability, education, health & health care, neighbourhood & built 
environment, and social & community context. Analyses consisted of: 1) 
comparison of mean life expectancy among countries and territories with- and 
without- publicly funded health care; 2) correlations in life expectancy across 
social determinants by health care access and level of burden; and 3) 
correlations in life expectancy within social determinants for health care 
access by level of burden.
RESULTS: Overall, life expectancy in countries and territories with- publicly 
funded health care (Mean (m) = 76.7 years) was significantly longer compared to 
countries and territories without- publicly funded health care (m = 66.8 years, 
P < 0.0001). For each social determinant, we observed longer life expectancy 
continued to be associated with publicly funded health care access across 
stratum (P < 0.0001), but difference in years of life expectancy existed both by 
burden of social determinant, as well as access to health care within quartiles 
of burden (Publicly funded care (yes): 68.12-80.88 years, (no): 62.39-77.33 
years, all P < 0.05). Both social determinants as well as the availability of 
publicly funded health care were individually and simultaneously associated with 
mean longevity of life between countries and territories worldwide.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate how, if made widely available, publicly 
funded health care could extend longevity of life. If combined with programs to 
reduce the burden of social determinants, a substantial impact can be made to 
promote more equitable distribution of life expectancies across the world. 
Ultimately, both access to publicly funded care and reducing inequalities in 
social determinants are needed in order to promote longer and healthier aging in 
populations worldwide.

PURPOSE: Contributions of neural and muscular factors to muscle strength change 
with growth, but such changes remain unclear in young populations. This study 
aimed to clarify the association between muscle strength and neural and muscular 
factors in youth athletes.
METHODS: Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) during isometric knee extension, 
the motor unit firing rate (MUFR), and muscle thickness (MT) of the vastus 
lateralis were measured in 70 youth male soccer players (mean [SD]; 
chronological age = 16.3 [0.6] y, peak height velocity age = 13.1 [1.0] y). MUFR 
and MT were measured with high-density surface electromyography and 
ultrasonography, respectively.
RESULTS: For MUFR and MT, correlations with MVC were calculated and the values 
of different MVC groups were compared. A significant correlation between MVC and 
MT (r = .49, P < .01) was noted, but not MUFR (r = .03, P > .05). There was also 
no significant correlation between MT and MUFR (r = -.33, P > .05). In addition, 
comparison among groups (higher-/middle-/lower-strength groups) revealed that MT 
in the lower-strength group was significantly lower than in middle-and 
higher-strength groups (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: In youth athletes, muscle strength is associated with muscular 
factors, rather than neural factors, and muscular and neural factors may 
independently contribute to muscle strength.

BACKGROUND: To describe the relationship between longevity and local access to 
preventive healthcare at the county level.
METHODS: We used Medicare outpatient reimbursement data from the 2010 Dartmouth 
Health Atlas and longevity data from Chetty et al. (2016) to identify the 
cross-sectional associations between county longevity, access to outpatient 
care, and the quality of primary care.
RESULTS: We find that the cost of outpatient care is inversely correlated with 
area life expectancy for individuals in the bottom income quartile. Much of this 
correlation is driven by men in the bottom income quartile. We also find that 
disaggregating a preventive care index produces significant relationships 
between components of the index and longevity where none were previously found.
CONCLUSIONS: These results counter prior assertions that local health costs are 
not associated with life expectancy. Additionally, the results also suggest that 
the local cost of outpatient care and the quality of that care may influence the 
longevity of low-income populations, especially for low-income men.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome of age-related physiological 
decline, which is associated with higher mortality and decreased healthy life 
expectancy, and muscle weakness is one of the presentations of frailty. We 
investigated an association between lifetime oral corticosteroid (OCS) exposure 
with frailty and muscle weakness among elderly patients with asthma.
METHODS: We studied 203 consecutive elderly outpatients with asthma aged ≥60 
years old. They were classified into three groups according to their cumulative 
lifetime OCS dose (lifetime non-users, lower-dose users, and higher-dose users), 
which was retrospectively estimated from the response to a structured 
questionnaire. The prevalence of frailty determined by the Kihon Checklist was 
compared between the three groups. Hand-grip strength, and lean mass index were 
also measured as markers of muscle strength.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent of the patients studied were considered frail. 
Higher cumulative lifetime OCS exposure was associated with a significantly 
higher prevalence of frailty (33% in lifetime non-users, 59% in lower-dose 
users, and 68% in higher-dose users; P for trend <0.005). This was also 
associated with lower hand-grip strength in both sexes (P for trend; 0.012 in 
men, and 0.020 in women), and lower lean mass index in men (P for trend 0.002). 
However, current doses of OCS were not significantly associated with these 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative lifetime OCS exposure was associated with a higher 
prevalence of frailty and muscle weakness. These findings emphasize the 
importance of minimizing lifetime OCS exposure for the prolongation of healthy 
life expectancy in patients with asthma.

INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the use of 
Souvenaid for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been previously evidenced. To 
complete the economic analysis, there is a need to assess whether society can 
afford it. The objective of this study was to carry out a budget impact analysis 
of the use of Souvenaid in Spain under the conditions of the LipiDidiet clinical 
trial from a societal perspective.
METHODS: We built a population model that took into account all the cohorts of 
individuals with AD, their individual progression, and the potential impact of 
Souvenaid treatment on their trajectories. Patient progression data were 
obtained from mixed models. The target population was estimated based on the 
population forecast for 2020-2035 and the incidence of dementia. Individual 
progression to dementia measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes 
was reproduced using mixed models. Besides the costs of treatment and diagnosis, 
direct costs of medical and non-medical care and indirect costs were included.
RESULTS: The epidemiological indicators and the distribution of life expectancy 
by stages validated the model. From the third year (2022), the differences in 
the cost of dementia offset the incremental cost of diagnosis and treatment. The 
costs of dependency reached €500 million/year while those of the intervention 
were limited to €40 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Souvenaid, with modest effectiveness in delaying dementia 
associated with AD, achieved a positive economic balance between costs and 
savings. Its use in the treatment of prodromal AD would imply an initial cost 
that would be ongoing, but this would be offset by savings in the care system 
for dependency associated with dementia from the third year. These results were 
based on adopting a societal perspective taking into account the effect of 
treatment on the use of health, social, and family resources.

INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of evolocumab with statins versus 
placebo combined with statins in the treatment of adult patients with 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > 70 mg/dl after the maximum tolerable dose of statin 
therapy in China.
METHODS: A Markov model, based on data from the FOURIER trial, claims databases, 
and published literature, was used to compare the health outcomes of the two 
therapies from the perspective of Chinese healthcare system. The time horizon in 
the model was a lifetime, the cycle length was a year, and the discount rate was 
5%. The output indicators of the model included direct medical costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on critical parameters such as 
cost, utility, and incidence of cardiovascular events to evaluate the effect of 
uncertainty in parameters and the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: In Chinese adult patients with ASCVD and LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dl, 
evolocumab was associated with incremental QALYs of 1.25 and incremental costs 
of 18,714 CNY versus placebo, both with a statin therapy, resulting in an ICER 
of 14,969 CNY/QALY gained, which was less than the willingness to pay (WTP) 
threshold (80,976 CNY/QALY, a capita GDP of China, 2021). The result of one-way 
sensitivity analysis indicated that when the effect of evolocumab on myocardial 
infarction (MI) rate after the first year varied, ICER changed the most. The 
results of probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of 
evolocumab added to statins being cost-effective at a threshold of 80,976 
CNY/QALY was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Compared with placebo and statin therapy combination, evolocumab 
added to statin therapy for adult patients with ASCVD and LDL-C > 70 mg/dl in 
China is cost-effective.

AIM: To perform a model-based analysis of the short- and long-term health 
benefits and costs of further increased implementation of empagliflozin for 
people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eCVD) in 
Sweden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The validated Institute for Health Economics Diabetes 
Cohort Model (IHE-DCM) was used to estimate health benefits and a 3-year budget 
impact, and lifetime costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained of 
increased implementation of adding empagliflozin to standard of care (SoC) for 
people with type 2 diabetes and eCVD in a Swedish setting. Scenarios with 
100%/75%/50% implementation were explored. Analyses were based on 30 model 
cohorts with type 2 diabetes and eCVD (n = 131 412 at baseline) from national 
health data registers. Sensitivity analyses explored the robustness of results.
RESULTS: Over 3 years, SoC with empagliflozin (100% implementation) versus SoC 
before empagliflozin resulted in 7700 total life years gained and reductions in 
cumulative incidence of cardiovascular deaths by 30% and heart failures by 28%. 
Annual costs increased by 15% from higher treatment costs and increased 
survival. Half of these benefits and costs are not yet reached with current 
implementation below 50%. SoC with empagliflozin yielded 0.37 QALYs per person, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 16 000 EUR per QALY versus SoC 
before empagliflozin.
CONCLUSIONS: Model simulations using real-world data and trial treatment effects 
indicated that a broader implementation of empagliflozin, in line with current 
guidelines for treatment of people with type 2 diabetes and eCVD, would lead to 
further benefits even from a short-term perspective.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients develop a 
drug-refractory epilepsy, that is, seizures cannot be controlled with 
antiepileptic drugs. Surgery has been evaluated as an effective but costly form 
of treatment. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the available 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment compared to medical 
treatment for these patients.
METHOD: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, 
PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation 
Database until September 2022. Title, abstract and full-text screening were 
conducted by two researchers. Original studies published in English or German 
analyzing the cost-effectiveness of surgical compared to medical treatment were 
included. Study characteristics, effectiveness measures, costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. The quality of studies was 
assessed using the Drummond checklist.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. Most studies evaluated surgery as 
cost-effective. The ICER per patient seizure free ranged from dominant to 
purchasing power parity US dollars (PPP-USD) 479,275. The ICER per 1% seizure 
reduction ranged from PPP-USD 227 to PPP-USD 342. The ICER per year without 
seizures was PPP-USD 4202 and the ICER per quality-adjusted life-year ranged 
from dominant to PPP-USD 90,874. The studies varied greatly in their methodology 
and time horizon.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment is cost-effective compared to medical treatment, 
especially when a lifetime horizon is adopted. It is concluded that all 
disease-specific costs should be considered over a long period when assessing 
the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. From an economic perspective, 
efforts should be made to improve access to surgical treatment for patients with 
drug-refractory epilepsy.

Diapause in insects is akin to dauer in Caenorhabditis elegans and hibernation 
in vertebrates, characterized by metabolic depression and lifespan extension. 
Previous studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in brains of diapause-destined pupae are 
more abundant than those in nondiapause-destined pupae in Helicoverpa armigera, 
but the ROS regulating HIF-1α activity remain unknown. Here, we showed that high 
ROS levels in brains of diapause-destined pupae resulted in low casein kinase 2 
(CK2) activity and that downregulation of CK2 caused low expression of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), which is an inhibitor of 
p-p38. Thus, high p-p38 levels accumulate to improve HIF-1α activity via 
activating HIF-1α phosphorylation at the S732 residue to regulate insect 
diapause. This is the first report showing that a new pathway, ROS-CK2-MKP3-p38, 
regulates HIF-1α activity for lifespan in insects.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly men are underrepresented in prostate cancer (PCa) 
literature, with management based on individualized care pathways and life 
expectancy. Reports have shown survival benefit with radiation (XRT), surgery, 
and hormone (ADT) in localized disease. The objective of this study was to 
assess treatment trends and overall survival (OS) among men 75 years of age and 
older with cT1c PCa.
METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried to identify patients with cT1c 
PCa, aged 75 years and older, between 2004 and 2016. We excluded individuals 
with N1/NX or M1/MX disease, unknown treatment, treatment with both XRT and 
surgery, surgery other than radical prostatectomy (RP), or PSA > 10 ng/ml. We 
described 4 treatment cohorts: observation, XRT, surgery, and ADT alone. 
Treatment trends and OS were analyzed using SPSS.
RESULTS: Among 49,843 patients, 7% had surgery, 66% had XRT, 5% had ADT alone, 
and 22% were observed. From 2004-2016, a large decline in XRT was noted, with an 
increase in surgery and observation. Men receiving ADT alone were significantly 
older, with higher Gleason's score, and lower incomes. Cox regression revealed 
survival benefit for surgery and XRT (HR 0.44 and 0.69, P < .001 respectively); 
ADT had worse survival than observation (HR 1.23, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Fewer men 75 years of age and older with cT1c PCa are being 
diagnosed and treated. Rates of XRT have declined, with rises in surgery and 
observation. Survival benefit was seen for surgery and XRT among elderly men, 
which highlights the importance of proper patient selection for improved 
outcomes in a highly individualized sphere.

There is a growing interest in the neuroscience community on the advantages of 
multilayer functional brain networks. Researchers usually treated different 
frequencies separately at distinct functional brain networks. However, there is 
strong evidence that these networks share complementary information while their 
interdependencies could reveal novel findings. For this purpose, neuroscientists 
adopt multilayer networks, which can be described mathematically as an extension 
of trivial single-layer networks. Multilayer networks have become popular in 
neuroscience due to their advantage to integrate different sources of 
information. Here, Ι will focus on the multi-frequency multilayer functional 
connectivity analysis on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) recordings. However, 
constructing a multilayer network depends on selecting multiple pre-processing 
steps that can affect the final network topology. Here, I analyzed the rs-fMRI 
dataset from a single human performing scanning over a period of 18 months (84 
scans in total), and the rs-fMRI dataset containing 25 subjects with 3 repeat 
scans. I focused on assessing the reproducibility of multi-frequency multilayer 
topologies exploring the effect of two filtering methods for extracting 
frequencies from BOLD activity, three connectivity estimators, with or without a 
topological filtering scheme, and two spatial scales. Finally, I untangled 
specific combinations of researchers' choices that yield consistently brain 
networks with repeatable topologies, giving me the chance to recommend best 
practices over consistent topologies.

BACKGROUND: One-third of peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) fail from 
inflammatory or infectious complications, causing substantial treatment 
interruption and replacement procedures.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare complications between integrated PIVCs (inbuilt 
extension sets, wings, and flattened bases) and traditional nonintegrated PIVCs.
DESIGNS, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A centrally randomized, controlled, 
superiority trial (with allocation concealment until study entry) was conducted 
in three Australian hospitals. Medical-surgical patients (one PIVC each) 
requiring intravenous therapy for >24 h were studied.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was device failure (composite: 
occlusion, infiltration, phlebitis, dislodgement, local, or bloodstream 
infection). Infection endpoints were assessor-masked. The secondary outcomes 
were: failure type, first-time insertion success, tip colonization, insertion 
pain, dwell time, mortality, costs, health-related quality of life, clinician, 
and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Out of 1759 patients randomized (integrated PIVC, n = 881; 
nonintegrated PIVC, n = 878), 1710 (97%) received a PIVC and were in the 
modified intention-to-treat analysis (2269 PIVC-days integrated; 2073 PIVC-days 
nonintegrated). Device failure incidence was 35% (145 per 1000 device-days) 
nonintegrated, and 33% (124 per 1000 device-days) integrated PIVCs.
INTERVENTION: Integrated PIVCs had a significantly lower failure risk (adjusted 
[sex, infection, setting, site, gauge] hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82 [95% confidence 
interval, CI: 0.69-0.96], p = .015). The per-protocol analysis was consistent 
(adjusted HR: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.68-0.95], p = .010). Integrated PIVCs had 
significantly longer dwell (top quartile ≥ 95 vs. ≥84 h). Mean per-patient costs 
were not statistically different.
CONCLUSIONS: PIVC failure is common and complex. Significant risk factors 
include sex, infection at baseline, care setting, insertion site, catheter 
gauge, and catheter type. Integrated PIVCs can significantly reduce the burden 
of PIVC failure on patients and the health system.

Background: Sensitive and patient-centred discussion about life expectancy has 
clear benefits for patients with advanced cancer and their families. The 
perceptions of oncology nurses about disclosure of life expectancy, and the 
barriers to disclosure, have rarely been explored. Objectives/Aims/Hypotheses: 
To examine oncology nurses' perceptions of the: (1) proportion of patients with 
advanced cancer who want, receive and understand estimates of life expectancy; 
(2) reasons why doctors may not provide estimates of life expectancy. Design: 
Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Australian oncology nurses who were members of 
a professional society or worked at a participating metropolitan cancer centre 
were emailed a link to an anonymous online survey. Participants provided 
socio-demographic characteristics and their perceptions about the proportion of 
patients with advanced cancer who (a) want, (b) are provided with, (c) receive 
and (d) understand estimates of life expectancy, as well as the reasons 
estimates of life expectancy may not be provided. Results: A total of 104 nurses 
participated. While 51% of nurses perceived that most patients (>75%) want to be 
provided with an estimate of their life expectancy, 63% of nurses reported that 
<50% of patients were provided with an estimate. Further, 85% of nurses 
indicated that <50% of patients understand the estimate. The most frequent 
reason nurses perceived doctors did not provide an estimate of life expectancy 
was because the doctor didn't have an accurate idea of life expectancy (80.8%). 
Almost one-fifth of nurses (18.3%) thought that doctors did not provide 
estimates because they felt it was not their responsibility to do so. 
Conclusions: Strategies to ensure a patient-centred approach to life expectancy 
discussions with patients with advanced cancer are urgently needed. Impact 
statement: Oncology nurses perceive that many patients with advanced cancer are 
not provided with an accurate estimate of their life expectancy and few 
understand the information provided to them.

Insufficient bone regeneration is a common issue for patients with extensive 
bone damage, therefore the use of allografts is required. With increasing life 
expectancy, there is a higher risk of bone repair issues after fractures or 
orthopedic surgical intervention. We studied incorporation and remodeling of 
structural allografts in critical size metaphyseal femur defects in 52 rats aged 
3-month-old and 12-month-old who underwent surgeries creating a bone defect, 
which was either filled with a structural allograft (3-month-old - 3moAllo; 
12-month-old - 12moAllo) or left empty (3-month-old - 3moE; 12-month-old - 
12moE). Histological analyses were performed 14, 28 and 90 days after the 
surgery. The percentage of bone and fibrous tissues, and allograft relative to 
the defect area was evaluated. The transmission electron microscopy was carried 
out 14 days after allograft implantation. When the defect was empty, slower bone 
regeneration was observed in 12moE rats versus 3moE, leading to sufficient 
irregularities in the anatomic structure of the femur 90 days after the surgery. 
When a structural allograft was used, the area of the fibrous tissue was larger 
in the defects of 12moAllo compared with 3moAllo rats 90 days after surgery. No 
age-related differences were found in the allograft remodeling and structures of 
the osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts over the observation period. 
Evident issues with bone regeneration were found in critical size defects both 
of 12moE and 12moAllo rats. However, the allograft use allowed the bone 
maintaining anatomic structure 90 days after the surgery.

In time, osteoarthritis (OA) generates the misalignment of the affected joint 
structures. However, due to the nature of bipedal gait, OA in the lower limb can 
also cause pathological gait patterns, which can generate instability and falls, 
with great consequence, especially in the aged population. With goniometry used 
to evaluate the range of motion (ROM) of joints, we wanted to evaluate how 
gender impacts gait dynamics in OA patients. For this study, we have compared 
106 OA patients (74 females and 32 males) to age matched controls. All 
participants had their right leg as dominant. Video recording of normal gait was 
analyzed with a digital goniometry tool phone application, and the knee's ROM 
was measured in midstance and midswing moment of the gait. During midstance, 
significant extension and flexion of the knee excursion have been observed in 
both males and females. During midswing, knee OA presents more differences, 
whereas subjects with hip and knee OA present changes on the dominant knee. 
Midstance changes suggest that the knee's joint degenerative changes, such as 
synovitis, can be linked to hip OA secondary changes. Midswing changes in lower 
limb OA suggest a connection to the activities of daily life. Gender differences 
generated by OA must furthermore be studied in both lower limbs so that the best 
therapeutic approach can be chosen.

The Impact of Social Influence on the Intention to Use Physician Rating 
Websites: Moderated Mediation Analysis Using a Mixed Methods Approach.

    J Med Internet Res. 2023 Nov 22;25:e45570.

BACKGROUND: Physician rating websites (PRWs) have become increasingly important 
in the cross-section between health and digitalization. Social influence plays a 
crucial role in human behavior in many domains of life, as can be demonstrated 
by the increase in high-profile influential individuals such as social media 
influencers (SMIs). Particularly in the health-specific environment, the opinion 
of family and friends has a significant influence on health-related decisions. 
However, so far, there has been little discussion about the role of social 
influence as an antecedent of behavioral intention to use PRWs.
OBJECTIVE: On the basis of theories of social psychology and technology 
acceptance and theories from the economic perspective, this study aimed to 
evaluate the impact of social influence on the behavioral intention to use PRWs.
METHODS: We conducted 2 studies by applying a mixed methods approach including a 
total of 712 participants from the Austrian population. The impact of social 
influence on the behavioral intention to use PRWs was investigated through 
linear regression and mediation and moderated mediation analysis using the 
PROCESS macro 4.0 in SPSS 27 (IBM Corp).
RESULTS: The 2 studies show similar results. In study 1, an experiment, no 
direct effect of social influence on the behavioral intention to use PRWs could 
be detected. However, an indirect effect of social influence on the behavioral 
intention to use PRWs via credibility (b=0.572; P=.005) and performance 
expectancy (b=0.340; P<.001) could be confirmed. The results of study 2, a 
cross-sectional study, demonstrate that social influence seems to have a direct 
impact on the behavioral intention to use PRWs (b=0.410; P<.001). However, when 
calculating the proposed mediation model, it becomes clear that this impact may 
partly be explained through the 2 mediator variables-credibility (b=0.208; 
P<.001) and performance expectancy (b=0.312; P<.001). In contrast to the 
observed direct and indirect effect, neither demographic nor psychographic 
variables have a significant moderating impact on the influencing chain in study 
2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an indication that social influence has at 
least an indirect impact on the behavioral intention to use PRWs. It was 
observed that this impact is exerted through credibility and performance 
expectancy. According to the findings of both studies, social influence has the 
potential to boost the use of PRWs. As a result, these web-based networks might 
be a promising future interface between health care and digitalization, allowing 
health care practitioners to gain a beneficial external impact while also 
learning from feedback. Social influence nowadays is not just limited to friends 
and family but can also be exerted by SMIs in the domain of PRW use. Thus, from 
a marketing perspective, PRW providers could think of collaborating with SMIs,
