The demographic transition from high to low levels of mortality and fertility 
brings about changes that stretch the “arc of life,” making each stage of life 
longer and creating new ones—a phenomenon we call “the demographic stretch.” 
This stretch can transform societal structure, for example, by extending 
childhood, shifting working ages up, delaying marriage and childbearing, 
improving women’s status and equity, and pushing the burden of chronic disease 
and disability to older ages. Global health efforts must address the resultant 
economic and social changes.

To better understand the predator-prey relationship and to compare predation 
rates, we studied the life table and predation rate of the predator Eocanthecona 
furcellata Wolff (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) when reared on two major crucifer 
pests, Spodoptera litura (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Plutella xylostella 
L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). The net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of 
increase, finite rate, and net predation rates of E. furcellata reared on P. 
xylostella were 292.4 offspring, 0.1389 d(-1), 1.1490 d(-1), and 644.1 third 
instars of P. xylostella, respectively. These values are significantly higher 
than those reared on S. litura, i.e., 272.3 offspring, 0.1220 d(-1), 1.1298 
d(-1), and 863.1 third instars of S. litura. To evaluate the predation potential 
of E. furcellata fed on P. xylostella and S. litura, we combined both the growth 
rate and predation rate to calculate the finite predation rate (ω); our results 
showed that E. furcellata is an effective predator of both S. litura (ω = 
1.6029) and P. xylostella (ω = 1.4277).

Present and future of cervical cancer prevention in Spain: a cost-effectiveness 
analysis.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination within a nonorganized setting creates a 
poor cost-effectiveness scenario. However, framed within an organized screening 
including primary HPV DNA testing with lengthening intervals may provide the 
best health value for invested money. To compare the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of different cervical cancer (CC) prevention strategies, 
including current status and new proposed screening practices, to inform health 
decision-makers in Spain, a Markov model was developed to simulate the natural 
history of HPV and CC. Outcomes included cases averted, life expectancy, 
reduction in the lifetime risk of CC, life years saved, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), net health benefits, lifetime costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. The willingness-to-pay threshold is defined at 
20 000&OV0556;/QALY. Both costs and health outcomes were discounted at an annual 
rate of 3%. A strategy of 5-year organized HPV testing has similar 
effectiveness, but higher efficiency than 3-year cytology. Screening alone and 
vaccination combined with cytology are dominated by vaccination followed by 
5-year HPV testing with cytology triage (12 214&OV0556;/QALY). The optimal age 
for both ending screening and switching age from cytology to HPV testing in 
older women is 5 years later for unvaccinated than for vaccinated women. Net 
health benefits decrease faster with diminishing vaccination coverage than 
screening coverage. Primary HPV DNA testing is more effective and cost-effective 
than current cytological screening. Vaccination uptake improvements and a 
gradual change toward an organized screening practice are critical components 
for achieving higher effectiveness and efficiency in the prevention of CC in 
Spain.

Longevity and Education: A Demographic Perspective.

Jasilionis D(1), Shkolnikov VM.

Author information:
(1)Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany.

In the second half of the 20th century, the advances in human longevity observed 
have been accompanied by an increase in the disparities between countries and 
regions. Education is one of the strongest predictors of life expectancy. 
Studies have shown that both relative and absolute mortality differences by 
education within countries have been increasing, even in the most developed and 
egalitarian countries. It is possible to assume that groups of highly educated 
people who systematically display life expectancy levels which are higher than 
the observed best practice (record) life expectancy at the national level are 
vanguards who are leading the way toward a lengthening of life for the remaining 
population groups. This evidence based on population-level statistics and 
exploring an important single factor could inspire further discussion about the 
possibilities for extending human length of life at the national level. However, 
more comprehensive and reliable data covering a larger number of countries and 
more covariates are needed for understanding health effects of education and 
prospects of human longevity.

[Pancreas transplantation: State of the art and future prospects].

[Article in Czech]

Saudek F, Girman P, Lipár K, Bouček P, Kožnarová R, Kočík M.

During the past 30 years pancreas transplantation evolved into a routine 
procedure especially suitable for type 1 diabetic recipients undergoing 
simultaneously kidney transplantation significantly improving quality of life 
and life expectancy as compared with kidney only recipients. It provides insulin 
independence with near-normal glucose control without special dietary 
restriction, freedom from hypoglycemia and chance for halting or regression of 
microangiopathic diabetes complications. As a separate procedure, pancreas 
transplantation is carried out mainly in selected subjects suffering from severe 
hypoglycemic episodes and impaired hypoglycemia awareness or as a subsequent 
procedure in type 1 diabetic kidney recipients from both cadaveric or living 
donors. Five-year insulin independence rate following combined pancreas and 
kidney, pancreas only and pancreas after kidney procedures currently exceed 75, 
50 and 62 %, respectively. Though the outcomes still continue to improve, the 
rate of pancreas transplants has reached a plateau in several European countries 
or even declines in the United States. Main reasons for that include fewer 
referrals from diabetes specialist, decreased donor quality, introduction of 
islet transplantation as a less invasive procedure but probably most of all 
probably insufficient information on the latest progress and trends achieved in 
this area. In the area of transplant therapy of diabetes Czech Republic 
traditionally ranks to the most active countries providing different transplant 
options according to individual clinical needs including islet transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-utility analysis on the treatment of attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with methylphenidate immediate-release 
(MPH-IR) in children and adolescents from Brazil.
METHOD: A Markov model was constructed to compare MPH-IR vs. no treatment. A 
24-week naturalistic study was conducted to collect transition probabilities and 
utility data. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), 
and costs reported in 2014 international dollars (I$). The perspective was the 
Brazilian Unified Health System as payer, and the time horizon was 6 years.
RESULTS: Of 171 patients, 73 provided information at baseline, and 56 at week 
24. Considering the MPH-IR monthly cost of I$ 38, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of treatment was I$ 9,103/QALY for children and 
I$ 11,883/QALY for adolescents. In two-way sensitivity analysis, considering one 
Gross National Product per capita (I$ 11,530) as willingness-to-pay, a cost of 
no-treatment lower than I$ 45/month would render MPH-IR a cost-saving strategy.
DISCUSSION: MPH-IR treatment of children and adolescents is cost-effective for 
ADHD patients from the Brazilian public health system perspective. Both patients 
and the healthcare system might benefit from such a strategy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of 20 weeks of resistance and concurrent 
training on psychotic and depressive symptoms, quality of life outcomes, and 
serum IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
concentrations in patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: In this blind, randomized controlled clinical trial, 34 patients with 
schizophrenia were assigned to one of three groups: control (CTRL, n=13), 
resistance exercise (RESEX, n=12), or concurrent exercise (CONCEX, n=9). 
Symptoms, quality of life, strength, and other variables were assessed.
RESULTS: A significant time-by-group interaction was found for the RESEX and 
CONCEX groups on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score 
for disease symptoms (p = 0.007), positive symptoms (p = 0.003), and on the arm 
extension one-repetition maximum (1RM) test (p = 0.016). In addition, 
significant improvements on negative symptoms (p = 0.027), on the role-physical 
domain of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (p = 0.019), and on the chest press 
1RM test (p = 0.040) were observed in the RESEX group. No changes were observed 
for the other variables investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of patients with schizophrenia, 20 weeks of 
resistance or concurrent exercise program improved disease symptoms, strength, 
and quality of life. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01674543.

The Huge Reduction in Adult Male Mortality in Belarus and Russia: Is It 
Attributable to Anti-Alcohol Measures?

Grigoriev P(1), Andreev EM(2).

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Harmful alcohol consumption has long been recognized as 
being the major determinant of male premature mortality in the European 
countries of the former USSR. Our focus here is on Belarus and Russia, two 
Slavic countries which continue to suffer enormously from the burden of the 
harmful consumption of alcohol. However, after a long period of deterioration, 
mortality trends in these countries have been improving over the past decade. We 
aim to investigate to what extent the recent declines in adult mortality in 
Belarus and Russia are attributable to the anti-alcohol measures introduced in 
these two countries in the 2000s.
DATA AND METHODS: We rely on the detailed cause-specific mortality series for 
the period 1980-2013. Our analysis focuses on the male population, and considers 
only a limited number of causes of death which we label as being 
alcohol-related: accidental poisoning by alcohol, liver cirrhosis, ischemic 
heart diseases, stroke, transportation accidents, and other external causes. For 
each of these causes we computed age-standardized death rates. The life table 
decomposition method was used to determine the age groups and the causes of 
death responsible for changes in life expectancy over time.
CONCLUSION: Our results do not lead us to conclude that the schedule of 
anti-alcohol measures corresponds to the schedule of mortality changes. The 
continuous reduction in adult male mortality seen in Belarus and Russia cannot 
be fully explained by the anti-alcohol policies implemented in these countries, 
although these policies likely contributed to the large mortality reductions 
observed in Belarus and Russia in 2005-2006 and in Belarus in 2012. Thus, the 
effects of these policies appear to have been modest. We argue that the 
anti-alcohol measures implemented in Belarus and Russia simply coincided with 
fluctuations in alcohol-related mortality which originated in the past. If these 
trends had not been underway already, these huge mortality effects would not 
have occurred.

Dementia is becoming a major health burden, which is mainly due to the 
increasing life expectancy in many developed countries. To describe the disease 
progression of individuals, multistate models are generally appropriate tools. 
These models allow the individuals to move along a path consisting of a finite 
number of disease states. We consider a simplifying illness-death model in which 
the subjects progress through the states healthy, diseased and dead. We use this 
model to study analytic relationships between the prevalence, incidence and 
mortality rates of irreversible diseases that have been applied in the past. One 
of these approaches is a rather recently proposed technique based on an ordinary 
differential equation (ODE). We conduct a simulation study to compare the 
performance of two suggested numerical approximations of this ODE with three 
alternative techniques, the common goal of which is to estimate age-specific 
incidence from cross-sectional information. The quality of the estimation 
methods is further explored using data on dementia in Germany. In the simulation 
scenarios as well as in the dementia data setting, the ODE method turns out to 
be the predominant technique with regard to the quality of the estimation of the 
known incidence regimes.

In the last decade, an increasing number of patients over 75 years of age are 
starting renal replacement therapy. Frailty is highly prevalent in elderly 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the context of the increased 
prevalence of some ESRD-associated conditions: protein-energy wasting, 
inflammation, anaemia, acidosis or hormonal disturbances. There are currently no 
hard data to support guidance on the optimal duration of dialysis for 
frail/elderly ESRD patients. The current debate is not about starting dialysis 
or managing conservatory frail ESRD patients, but whether a more intensive 
regimen once dialysis is initiated (for whatever reasons and circumstances) 
would improve patients' outcome. The most important issue is that all studies 
performed with extended/alternative dialysis regimens do not specifically 
address this particular type of patients and therefore all the inferences are 
derived from the general ESRD population. Care planning should be responsive to 
end-of-life needs whatever the treatment modality. Care in this setting should 
focus on symptom control and quality of life rather than life extension. We 
conclude that, similar to the general dialysed population, extensive application 
of more intensive dialysis schedules is not based on solid evidence. However, 
after a thorough clinical evaluation, a limited period of a trial of intensive 
dialysis could be prescribed in more problematic patients.

There is unmet need in patients suffering from chronic pain, yet innovation may 
be impeded by the difficulty of justifying economic value in a field beset by 
data limitations and methodological variability. A systematic review was 
conducted to identify and summarise the key areas of variability and limitations 
in modelling approaches in the economic evaluation of treatments for chronic 
pain. The results of the literature review were then used to support the 
development of a fully flexible open-source economic model structure, designed 
to test structural and data assumptions and act as a reference for future 
modelling practice. The key model design themes identified from the systematic 
review included: time horizon; titration and stabilisation; number of treatment 
lines; choice/ordering of treatment; and the impact of parameter uncertainty 
(given reliance on expert opinion). Exploratory analyses using the model to 
compare a hypothetical novel therapy versus morphine as first-line treatments 
showed cost-effectiveness results to be sensitive to structural and data 
assumptions. Assumptions about the treatment pathway and choice of time horizon 
were key model drivers. Our results suggest structural model design and data 
assumptions may have driven previous cost-effectiveness results and ultimately 
decisions based on economic value. We therefore conclude that it is vital that 
future economic models in chronic pain are designed to be fully transparent and 
hope our open-source code is useful in order to aspire to a common approach to 
modelling pain that includes robust sensitivity analyses to test structural and 
parameter uncertainty.

780. Exploring Opportunities for Collaboration Between Health and Education to 
Improve Population Health: Workshop Summary.

Roundtable on Population Health Improvement; Board on Population Health and 
Public Health Practice; Institute of Medicine.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2015 Aug 27.

Research based on decades of experience in the developing world has identified 
educational status, especially the status of the mother, as a major predictor of 
health outcomes and that the literature indicates that the gradient in health 
outcomes by educational attainment has steepened over the last four decades 
across the United States. Since the 1990s, while the average life expectancy in 
the United States has been steadily increasing, life expectancy has actually 
decreased for people without a high school education, especially white women. To 
understand the complex relationship between education and health and how this 
understanding could inform our nation's investments and policies, the Institute 
of Medicine Roundtable on Population Health Improvement held a public workshop 
in Washington, DC, on June 5, 2014. This workshop, which featured presentations 
and extensive discussion periods, also explored how the health and education 
sectors can work together more effectively to achieve improvements in both 
health status and educational achievement. This report summarizes the 
presentations and discussion of the workshop.

The global population is currently undergoing an upward shift in its age 
structure due to decreasing fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. As a 
result, clinicians worldwide will be required to manage an increasing number of 
spinal disorders specific to the elderly and the aging of the spine. Elderly 
individuals pose unique challenges to health care systems and to spinal 
physicians as these patients typically have an increased number of medical 
comorbidities, reduced bone density mass, more severe spinal degeneration and a 
greater propensity to falls. In anticipation of the aging of the population, we 
undertook this project to heighten physicians' awareness of age-related spinal

BACKGROUND: Value-based purchasing is rapidly being implemented to rein in the 
unsustainably rising costs of the US healthcare system. With a growing elderly 
population, it is vital to understand the value of spinal surgery in this group 
of individuals.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of lumbar decompression with and 
without fusion for degenerative spine disease in elderly vs nonelderly patients.
METHODS: A total of 221 patients undergoing elective primary surgery for 
degenerative lumbar pathology who were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal 
registry were analyzed. Patient-reported outcomes of Oswestry Disability Index, 
numeric rating scale for back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores 
(EuroQol-5D) were recorded. Two-year back-related medical resource use, missed 
work, and health-state values (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) were 
assessed. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare 
national allowable payment amounts (direct cost). Patient and caregiver workday 
losses were multiplied by gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Patients were 
divided into age groups <70 and ≥70 years.
RESULTS: Mean cumulative 2-year QALYs gained were statistically similar between 
younger and older patients for both decompression alone (0.67 ± 0.65 vs 0.56 ± 
0.65; P = .47) and decompression with fusion (0.56 ± 0.55 vs 0.59 ± 0.55; P = 
.26). Mean 2-year cost per QALY gained between younger and older patients was 
similar for both decompression alone ($24,365 vs $31,750 per QALY; P = .11) and 
decompression with fusion ($64,228 vs $60,183 per QALY; P = .09).
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment provided significant improvements in pain, 
disability, and quality of life for elderly patients with degenerative lumbar 
disease. Observed costs per QALY gained for lumbar decompression with and 
without fusion were similar for younger and older patients, demonstrating that 
lumbar spine surgery in the elderly is an equally cost-effective and valuable 
intervention.

The proportion of the population over age 65 in the United States continues to 
increase over time, from 12% in 2000 to a projected 20% by 2030. There is an 
associated rise in the prevalence of degenerative spinal disorders with this 
aging population. This will lead to an increase in demand for both nonsurgical 
and surgical treatment for these disabling conditions, which will stress an 
already overburdened healthcare system. Utilization of spinal procedures and 
services has grown considerably. Comparing 1999 to 2009, lumbar epidural steroid 
injections have increased by nearly 900,000 procedures performed per year, while 
physical therapy evaluations have increased by nearly 1.4 million visits per 
year. We review the literature regarding the cost-effectiveness of spinal 
surgery compared to conservative treatment. Decompressive lumbar spinal surgery 
has been shown to be cost-effective in several studies, while adult spinal 
deformity surgery has higher total cost per quality-adjusted life year gained in 
the short term. With an aging population and unsustainable healthcare costs, we 
may be faced with a shortfall of beneficial spine care as demand for spinal 
surgery in our elderly population continues to rise.

BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse 
epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural 
subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis is a 
life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary 
haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality 
has contributed to its neglected disease status.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of published 
morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease 
incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling 
were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for 
countries and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO regions. We estimated 
mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease 
morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease 
incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such 
as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, 
which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life 
expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and 
urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R(2) = 0.60) of the 
variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 
1.03 million cases (95% CI 434,000-1,750,000) and 58,900 deaths (95% CI 
23,800-95,900) due to leptospirosis worldwide. A large proportion of cases (48%, 
95% CI 40-61%) and deaths (42%, 95% CI 34-53%) were estimated to occur in adult 
males with age of 20-49 years. Highest estimates of disease morbidity and 
mortality were observed in GBD regions of South and Southeast Asia, Oceania, 
Caribbean, Andean, Central, and Tropical Latin America, and East Sub-Saharan 
Africa.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of 
morbidity worldwide and accounts for numbers of deaths, which approach or exceed 
those for other causes of haemorrhagic fever. Highest morbidity and mortality 
were estimated to occur in resource-poor countries, which include regions where 
the burden of leptospirosis has been underappreciated.

International guidelines for the management of pancreatic intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms.

The management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) is presently 
evolving as a result of the improved understanding of the natural history and 
biological behavior of the different pancreatic cystic neoplasms; and better 
preoperative diagnosis of these neoplasms due to advancement in preoperative 
diagnostic tools. International consensus guidelines for the management of IPMN 
were first formulated in 2006 and subsequently revised in 2012. Both these 
guidelines were constructed based on expert opinion and not on robust clinical 
data. The main limitation of the original Sendai guidelines was that it had a 
low positive predictive value resulting in many benign neoplasms being resected. 
Hence, these guidelines were revised in 2012. However, although the updated 
guidelines resulted in an improvement in the positive predictive value over the 
Sendai Guidelines, the results of several studies validating these guidelines 
demonstrated that its positive predictive value remained low. Furthermore, 
although both guidelines were associated with high negative predictive values, 
several investigators have demonstrated that some malignant IPMNs may be missed. 
Finally, it is imperative to emphasize that major considerations when managing a 
patient with IPMN including the patient's surgical risk, life-expectancy and 
even cost of investigations are not taken into account in current guidelines. 
The management of a patient with IPMN should be individualized and tailored 
according to a patient's risk benefit profile for resection vs surveillance.

Microglia are specialized phagocytes in the vertebrate central nervous system 
(CNS). As the resident immune cells of the CNS they play an important role in 
the removal of dying neurons during both development and in several neuronal 
pathologies. Microglia have been shown to prevent the diffusion of damaging 
degradation products of dying neurons by engulfment and ingestion. Here we 
describe a live imaging approach that uses UV laser ablation to selectively 
stress and kill spinal neurons and visualize the clearance of neuronal remnants 
by microglia in the zebrafish spinal cord. In vivo imaging confirmed the motile 
nature of microglia within the uninjured spinal cord. However, selective 
neuronal ablation triggered rapid activation of microglia, leading to phagocytic 
uptake of neuronal debris by microglia within 20-30 min. This process of 
microglial engulfment is highly dynamic, involving the extension of processes 
toward the lesion site and consequently the ingestion of the dying neuron. 3D 
rendering analysis of time-lapse recordings revealed the formation of 
phagosome-like structures in the activated microglia located at the site of 
neuronal ablation. This real-time representation of microglial phagocytosis in 
the living zebrafish spinal cord provides novel opportunities to study the 
mechanisms of microglia-mediated neuronal clearance.

With the demographic shift of the global population toward longer life 
expectancy, the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
rapidly expanded and is projected to triple by the year 2050. Current treatments 
provide symptomatic relief but do not affect the underlying pathology of the 
disease. Therapies that prevent or slow the progression of the disease are 
urgently needed to avoid this growing public health emergency. Insights gained 
from decades of research have begun to unlock the pathophysiology of this 
complex disease and have provided targets for disease-modifying therapies. In 
the last decade, few therapeutic agents designed to modify the underlying 
disease process have progressed to clinical trials and none have been brought to 
market. With the focus on disease modification, biomarkers promise to play an 
increasingly important role in clinical trials. Six biomarkers have now been 
included in diagnostic criteria for AD and are regularly incorporated into 
clinical trials. Three biomarkers are neuroimaging measures - hippocampal 
atrophy measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid uptake as measured 
by Pittsburg compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), and decreased 
fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) uptake as measured by PET (FDG-PET) - and three are 
sampled from fluid sources - cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid β42 (Aβ42), 
total tau, and phosphorylated tau. Fluid biomarkers are important because they 
can provide information regarding the underlying biochemical processes that are 
occurring in the brain. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature 
regarding the existing and emerging fluid biomarkers and to examine how fluid 
biomarkers have been incorporated into clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Average life expectancy is rising, resulting in increasing numbers 
of elderly, frail individuals presenting with coronary artery disease and 
requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI can be of value for this 
population, but little is known about the balance of benefit versus risk, 
particularly in the frail.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between frailty and clinical outcomes 
in patients undergoing PCI.
METHODS: Patients undergoing PCI, for either stable angina or acute coronary 
syndrome, were prospectively assessed for frailty using the Canadian Study of 
Health and Ageing Clinical Frailty Scale. Demographics, clinical and 
angiographic data were extracted from the hospital database. Mortality was 
obtained from the Office of National Statistics.
RESULTS: Frailty was assessed in 745 patients undergoing PCI. The mean age of 
patients was 62±12 years and 70% were males. The median frailty score was 3 (IQR 
2-4). A frailty score ≥5, indicating significant frailty, was present in 81 
(11%) patients. Frail patients required longer hospitalisation after PCI. 
Frailty was also associated with increased 30-day (HR 4.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 16.3, 
p=0.013) and 1 year mortality (HR 5.9, 95% CI 2.5 to 13.8, p<0.001). Frailty was 
a predictor of length of hospital stay and mortality, independent of age, gender 
and comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple assessment of frailty can help predict mortality and the 
length of hospital stay, and may therefore guide healthcare providers to plan 
PCI and appropriate resources for frail patients.

PURPOSE: Many students in the Michigan State University College of Human 
Medicine (CHM) are non-traditional with unique needs and experiences. To meet 
these needs, in 1988 CHM developed a structured Extended Curriculum Program 
(ECP), which allows students to take longer than 2 years to complete the 
preclinical curriculum. This work examined the reasons why students extended 
their programs, their perceptions of that experience, and the outcome with 
respect to satisfaction and success in their careers after graduation.
METHODS: The analysis used data from the college database, follow-up surveys of 
residency directors and graduates, surveys of graduates who extended, and the 
AMA Physician Masterfile.
RESULTS: Graduates who responded to the survey were evenly split between those 
who extended for academic reasons and those who extended for other reasons. 
Although feelings about extending were mixed at the time of extension, nearly 
all respondents agreed that extending was the right decision in the long run. 
Extended students continued to face academic challenges having lower basic 
science averages, lower USMLE Step 1 and 2 first attempt pass rates, and more 
instances of repeated clerkships compared to those who did not extend, however, 
most were able to secure a residency in the specialty they desired and had 
comparable career satisfaction ratings.
CONCLUSIONS: The ECP allows some students to complete medical school who 
otherwise may not have been able to do so. This analysis has provided valuable 
information that was used to improve the program, allowing CHM to continue its 
mission of training a diverse set of students to be exemplary physicians.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is defined as the accumulation of abnormal mast cells 
(MC) in 1 or more extracutaneous tissues. Symptoms are due to either MC 
activation or organ infiltration and vary depending on disease subtype. More 
benign forms of SM, such as indolent SM, result in a life expectancy similar to 
the general population, while more aggressive subtypes, such as MC leukemia 
(MCL), have a median survival measured on the order of months. Treatment of 
indolent SM is directed at controlling the symptoms associated with MC 
activation. In advanced forms, such as aggressive SM and MCL, agents targeting 
MC proliferation such as KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cladribine, and 
thalidomide may be provided. Newer agents based on preclinical rationale are 
also being actively investigated. However, the only potentially curative therapy 
for aggressive SM/MCL remains hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given 
that SM is a relatively rare disease, clinicians are often underprepared to 
evaluate, diagnose, and effectively treat this clinically heterogeneous 
condition. Here we seek to familiarize clinicians with this orphan disease and 
review current and future treatment approaches.
