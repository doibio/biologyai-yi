racial differences. We then create life tables and apply a newly-developed 
demographic method to determine whether Asians have longer life expectancy 
because they are less likely than whites to die of causes of death that strike 
at younger ages, or because they tend to outlive whites regardless of cause of 
death.
RESULTS: Nearly 90% of the Asian-white life expectancy gap is attributable to 
the fact that Asians tend to outlive whites regardless of the cause of death. 
The causes that contribute the most to the gap are heart disease (24%) and 
cancers (18%). Men contribute somewhat more to the gap than women do (55% vs 
45%), primarily because Asian-white differences in mortality are greater among 
men than among women with respect to suicide, traffic accidents and accidental 
poisoning.
CONCLUSIONS: For almost all causes of death, Asian victims tend to be older than 
white victims. The greatest potential for raising the life expectancy of whites 
to that of Asians, then, resides in efforts that effectively increase whites' 
average age at death for the most common causes of death.

An ethological approach to attention predicts that organisms orient 
preferentially to valuable sources of information in the environment. For many 
gregarious species, orienting to other individuals provides valuable social 
information but competes with food acquisition, water consumption and predator 
avoidance. Individual variation in vigilance behaviour in humans spans a 
continuum from inattentive to pathological levels of interest in others. To 
assess the comparative biology of this behavioural variation, we probed 
vigilance rates in free-ranging macaques during water drinking, a behaviour 
incompatible with the gaze and postural demands of vigilance. Males were 
significantly more vigilant than females. Moreover, vigilance showed a clear 
genetic component, with an estimated heritability of 12%. Monkeys carrying a 
relatively infrequent 'long' allele of TPH2, a regulatory gene that influences 
serotonin production in the brain, were significantly less vigilant compared to 
monkeys that did not carry the allele. These findings resonate with the 
hypothesis that the serotonin pathway regulates vigilance in primates and by 
extension provoke the idea that individual variation in vigilance and its 
underlying biology may be adaptive rather than pathological.

BACKGROUND: Foodborne diseases are considered as major health problems in 
different countries. Concerns over the safety of some chemical preservatives and 
negative consumer reactions to them have prompted interest in natural 
alternatives for the maintenance or extension of food shelf life. In this 
respect, the combination of a plant essential oil and nisin has used for 
controlling the growth of foodborne pathogens as natural food preservative using 
the mathematical model.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different 
concentrations of Cuminum cyminum L. essential oil (0, 15, 30 and 45 µL/100 mL) 
and nisin (0, 0.5 and 1.5 µg/mL) combination at different temperatures (10, 25 
and 35°C) on growth of Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in the 
Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) broth model. The concentrations of 0 µL/100 mL for 
essential oil and 0 µg/mL for nisin imply the negative control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multivariate variance experiment was performed. To 
assess the effect of essential oil, nisin and the incubation temperature on 
growth probability (log P%) of S. typhimurium and S. aureus, four concentrations 
of C. cyminum L. essential oil (0, 15, 30 and 45 µL/100 mL), three 
concentrations of nisin (0, 0.5 and 1.5 µg/mL) and three storage temperatures 
(10, 25 and 35°C) were considered.
RESULTS: The growth of S. typhimurium was significantly decreased by the 
concentration of essential oil ≥ 30 µL/100 mL in combination with nisin ≥ 0.5 
µg/mL at temperature = 10°C (P < 0.05). Also, in combination of the essential 
oil ≥ 15 µL/100 mL and nisin ≥ 0.5 µg/mL at temperature ≤ 25°C, the growth of S. 
aureus was significantly reduced (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the combination of essential oil and 
nisin inhibits the growth of S. typhimurium and S. aureus bacteria and there is 
the possibility of using them as substitutes for chemical food preservatives. 
Moreover, the model (log P%) in this study can be a good tool for the reduction 
of microbiological hazards in food industry.

BACKGROUND: Brain tumor patients are quite different from other populations of 
cancer patients due to the complexity of supportive care needs, the trajectory 
of disease, the very short life expectancy, and resulting need for a specific 
palliative approach.
METHODS: A pilot program of comprehensive palliative care for brain tumor 
patients was started in the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute of Rome in 
October 2000, supported by the Lazio Regional Health System. The aim of this 
model of assistance was to meet patient's needs for care in all stages of 
disease, support the families, and reduce the rehospitalization rate. The 
efficacy of the model of care was evaluated analyzing the place of death, 
caregiver satisfaction, rehospitalization rate, and the impact on costs to the 
health system.
RESULTS: From October 2000 to December 2012, 848 patients affected by brain 
tumor were enrolled in a comprehensive program of neuro-oncological home care. 
Out of 529 patients who died, 323 (61%) were assisted at home until death, 117 
(22.2%) died in hospital, and 89 (16.8%) died in hospice. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in hospital readmission rates in 
the last 2 months of life compared with the control group (16.7% vs 38%; P < 
.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings concerning death at home, rehospitalization rate, 
quality of life, and satisfaction of patients and their relatives with the care 
received suggest that a neuro-oncologic palliative home-care program has a 
positive impact on the quality of care for brain tumor patients, particularly at 
the end of life.

Biological invaders have long been hypothesized to exhibit the fast end of the 
life-history spectrum, with early reproduction and a short lifespan. Here, we 
examine the rapid evolution of life history within the harlequin ladybird 
Harmonia axyridis. The species, once used as a biological control agent, is now 
a worldwide invader. We show that biocontrol populations have evolved a classic 
fast life history during their maintenance in laboratories. Invasive populations 
also reproduce earlier than native populations, but later than biocontrol ones. 
Invaders allocate more resources to reproduction than native and biocontrol 
individuals, and their reproduction is spread over a longer lifespan. This life 
history is best described as a bet-hedging strategy. We assert that invasiveness 
cannot be explained only by invoking faster life histories. Instead, the 
evolution of life history within invasive populations can progress rapidly and 
converge to a fine-tuned evolutionary match between the invaded environment and 
the invader.

Self-perceived health in the czech population: recent evidence.

Kurtinová O.

This article considers developing trends in self-perceptions of health among the 
Czech population. Its conclusions are based on data from the European Union 
Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) conducted from 2005-2011. 
The data analysis suggests that the compression of morbidity is present, but the 
Czech Republic continues to lag behind Western Europe. In addition, among males 
the difference in health expectancies between the Czech Republic and the EU-15 
is due to a change in mortality at higher ages, rather than in self-perceived 
health. Among females the opposite is true. Demographic categories, such as 
"attained education" and "age-group" proved to be significant factors in 
influencing self-perceived health in the Czech population for the year 2011. 
Gender and marital status seem to be less important.

AIM: To determine the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection, 
physiotherapy and a combination of these interventions, compared to a reference 
group receiving a blinded placebo injection.
METHODS: 165 adults with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia of longer than 
6 weeks duration from Brisbane, Australia, were randomised for concealed 
allocation to saline injection (placebo), corticosteroid injection, saline 
injection plus physiotherapy (eight sessions of elbow manipulation and exercise) 
or corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy. Costs to society and 
health-related quality of life (estimated by EuroQol-5D) over the 1 year 
follow-up were used to generate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) ratios for each intervention relative to placebo.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis was possible for 154 (93%) of trial 
participants. Physiotherapy was more costly, but was the only intervention that 
produced a statistically significant improvement in quality of life relative to 
placebo (MD, 95% CI 0.035, 0.003 to 0.068). Similar cost/QALY ratios were found 
for physiotherapy ($A29 343; GBP18 962) and corticosteroid injection ($A31 750; 
GBP20 518); however, the probability of being more cost-effective than placebo 
at values above $A50 000 per quality-adjusted life year was 81% for 
physiotherapy and 53% for corticosteroid injection. Cost/QALY was far greater 
for a combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy ($A228 000; 
GBP147 340).
SUMMARY: Physiotherapy was a cost-effective treatment for lateral 
epicondylalgia. Corticosteroid injection was associated with greater 
variability, and a lower probability of being cost-effective if a willingness to 
pay threshold of $A50 000 is assumed. A combination of corticosteroid injection 
and physiotherapy was ineffective and cost-ineffective. Physiotherapy, not 
corticosteroid injection, should be considered as a first-line intervention for 
lateral epicondylalgia.

Surgery: A Cross-Sectional Comparison of a Pediatric Surgical Unit in Kenya and 
Canada.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric surgical practice is different in low- and middle-income 
countries as compared to North America. While resources are limited, the impact 
of pediatric surgical procedures is significant. The objective of this study was 
to calculate and compare disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted in a 
Kenyan and Canadian surgical unit for a subset of pediatric congenital 
anomalies.
METHODS: Medical records of children having undergone surgical procedures for 13 
congenital conditions in both surgical units were collected over 12 months. 
DALYs for each condition were calculated using previously obtained disability 
weights derived in each country. Age-adjusted life expectancy rates from the WHO 
were used to determine years of life lost. Risk of permanent disability without 
surgery and probability of successful treatment values were obtained from the 
literature and included in the DALY calculation.
RESULTS: The conditions accounting for the largest total number of averted DALYs 
in Kenya were hydrocephalus (60.8%) and spina bifida (18.1%), whereas in Canada 
they were hydrocephalus (24.2%) and undescended testes (19.2%). A total of 
23,169 DALYs were averted through 1042 surgical procedures (22.2 DALYs per 
procedure) during the study period in Kenya, compared to 5497 DALYs through 373 
procedures (14.7 DALYs per procedure) in Canada.
CONCLUSIONS: Using recent developments in burden of disease measurement, the 
results point to the significant impact of pediatric surgical centers in 
addressing the global burden of congenital surgical disease. The study carries 
significant implications for resource allocation and training.

Overweight and obesity are associated to increased risk of developing 
non-communicable diseases that might dramatically affect life expectancy 
according World Health Organization. Overweight, obesity, and decline in 
physical activity are correlated to a significant propensity to lose skeletal 
muscle mass as a result of prolonged inflammation and oxidative stress whereas 
cohort surveys and clinical investigations have demonstrated health benefits of 
Citrus-based polyphenols to reverse such regression. Overweight men were 
included in a double-blind, randomized, parallel pilot trial where they received 
daily for a 12-week period 900 mg of a Citrus-based polyphenol extract, 
Sinetrol® XPur. Body composition, anthropometric, and blood parameters were 
assessed before and at the end of the intervention period. After 12 weeks, while 
the silhouette slimmed down, metabolic parameters were significantly improved 
and skeletal muscle catabolism held back. These data suggest that over a 12-week 
period, the efficacy of the supplement improve both overweight process and 
correlated skeletal muscle mass metabolism.

PURPOSE: To examine the long-term outcome after intramedullary nailing of 
femoral diaphysial fractures measured as disease-specific patient reported 
function, walking ability, muscle strength, pain and quality of life (QOL).
METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Retrospective review and follow-up with clinical 
examination of 48 patients treated with intramedullary nailing after femoral 
shaft fracture between 2007 and 2010. The patients underwent a clinical 
examination and assessment of walking ability, maximal muscle strength during 
knee flexion and extension and hip abduction. Hip disability and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (HOOS) and questionnaire evaluating QOL (Eq5D-5L) were completed 
by patients.
RESULTS: Fourty-eight patients agreed to participate. Mean time for follow-up 
was 4.7 years. The mean HOOS scores were 84.9 (Pain), 86.6 (ADL), 85.0 
(Symptoms), 72.6 (QOL), and 69.1 (Sport). The mean muscle strength of knee 
flexion with the injured leg (226.0 N) was significantly lower then knee flexion 
with the non-injured leg (259.5 N, P < 0.0001). Likewise for knee extension 
(335.2 vs 406.4 N, P < 0.001) and hip abduction (129.2 vs 156.0 N, P < 0.001). 
Significant association between HOOS and an increase in the difference in muscle 
strength were observed as well as between worse HOOS outcome and increasing body 
mass index.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that decreased muscle strength for knee flexion, 
knee extension and hip abduction was associated with worse long-term functional 
outcome measured with a disease-specific questionnaire (HOOS) after 
intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fracture.

Trapping quaternary structures of hemoglobin in single crystals or by 
encapsulation in silica gels has provided a demanding set of data to test 
statistical mechanical models of allostery. In this work, we compare the results 
of those experiments with predictions of the four major allosteric models for 
hemoglobin: the quaternary two-state model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux; the 
tertiary two-state model of Henry et al., which is the simplest extension of the 
Monod-Wyman-Changeux model to include pre-equilibria of tertiary as well as 
quaternary conformations; the structure-based model of Szabo and Karplus; and 
the modification of the latter model by Lee and Karplus. We show that only the 
tertiary two-state model can provide a near quantitative explanation of the 
single-crystal and gel experimental results.

PURPOSE: Too little is understood about the quality of life (QoL) concerns of 
patients diagnosed with advanced disease. While body image has been found to be 
consistently important for women with early-stage breast cancer, the impact of 
body image on women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is less frequently 
studied. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify factors affecting QoL in a 
sample of patients diagnosed with MBC, with particular attention to body image, 
disease site, and time since diagnosis.
METHODS: In total, 113 women diagnosed with MBC completed two QoL scales (EORTC 
QLQ30; EORTC BR23) as part of a larger study. Clinical characteristics were 
obtained via medical record review. Demographics, disease characteristics, and 
clinical factors were examined.
RESULTS: Time since diagnosis and location of metastases were found to affect 
patients' QoL, and most strikingly, this effect often differed for those with 
higher and lower body image. Body image appears to remain highly influential 
even for those living with a shortened life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the development of QoL support should 
more carefully consider patients diagnosed with MBC and the unique sets of body 
concerns that affect this population.

OBJECTIVE: Problems in pre-cancer diagnosis complicate cancer theragnosis as 
well as life expectancy. There is uncertainty regarding malignant transformation 
of oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), an oral pre-cancer with dysplastic (OSFWD) and 
non-dysplastic (OSFWT) subtypes. Understanding the structural, molecular and 
physical aspects of epithelial homeostasis may be useful.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histopathological grading of biopsy sections was 
performed using H&E staining. Alterations in epithelial surface architecture in 
different groups was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The 
expression of crucial epithelial genes (p63, CK-5/6, CK-10, E-cadherin and 
β-catenin) was studied by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-PCR 
analysis.
RESULTS: SEM observations revealed that the surface epithelial ridge pattern 
became thick and dense, and pit pattern gradually decreased in OSFWD and oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). p63, ΔNp63 and CK-5/6 were up-regulated in OSFWD 
and OSCC but down-regulated in OSFWT. CK-10 was down-regulated in OSFWD compared 
to OSFWT. Cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin was elevated in 
dysplastic and cancerous conditions. Moreover, statistical correlation between 
SEM features (ridges and pits) and molecular attributes demonstrated a 
significant positive relationship between the ridge-to-pit ratio and p63 
population density (r=0.85) and the ridge-to-pit ratio and CK-5/6 intensity 
(r=0.63).
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular changes related to epithelial progressive maturation and 
cellular proliferation are correlated with concomitant alteration of epithelial 
surface architecture which helps to predict the malignant potentiality of OSF.

OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a cost-effective strategy for the 
treatment of different neurologic disorders. However, DBS procedures are 
associated with high costs of implantation and replacement of the internal pulse 
generator (IPG). Different manufacturers propose the use of rechargeable IPGs. 
The objective of this study is to compare the implantation costs of 
nonrechargeable IPGs versus the estimated costs of rechargeable IPGs in 
different categories of patients to evaluate if an economic advantage for the 
health care system could be derived.
METHODS: The study looked at 149 patients who underwent a surgical procedure for 
IPG replacement. In a hypothetical scenario, rechargeable IPGs were implanted 
instead of nonrechargeable IPGs at the time of DBS system implantation. Another 
scenario was outlined in a perspective period of time, corresponding to the 
patients' life expectancy. Costs were calculated, and inferential analysis was 
performed.
RESULTS: A savings of €234,194, including the cost of management of 
complications, was calculated during a follow-up period of 7.9 years. In a 
comprehensive life expectancy period of 47 years, a savings of €5,918,188 would 
be obtained (P < 0.05). Long-term group data point out that a relevant savings 
would be expected from implantation of rechargeable IPGs in dystonic patients (P 
< 0.05) and patients with Parkinson disease (P < 0.05), and a savings 
is projected to occur in other categories of patients (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of rechargeable IPGs presents clinical advantages 
compared with nonrechargeable devices. A huge economic savings can be realized 
with the implantation of rechargeable IPGs in categories of patients implanted 
with IPGs for DBS.

BACKGROUND: There has been little research exploring the experience of dialysis 
therapy for people living in remote communities. Remote residence location has 
previously been associated with excess mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, 
suggesting that relocation to a referral center might improve outcomes. It is 
unknown whether patients view this approach as acceptable.
METHODS: We studied 121 remote-dwelling chronic HD patients using the time 
trade-off method applied to hypothetical scenarios.
RESULTS: Participants indicated that they would trade a median of 6 years of 
life in their current location (including current social supports) (95% CI 
2.25-7) for 10 years of life in a referral center without any of their existing 
social supports (meaning they would be willing to forgo 4 years of life to 
remain in their current residence location). When current social supports were 
assumed to continue in both locations, people were only willing to forego a 
median of 2 years of life (95% CI 1-4) to remain in their current location. 
Older participants were much less willing to accept relocation than younger 
participants; the median time trade-off associated with relocation and without 
social supports was 2 years for participants aged <50 years, 3 years for those 
aged 50-69.9 years and 9 years for those aged ≥70 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients currently living remotely were willing to 
forgo much of their remaining life expectancy rather than relocate-especially 
among older participants. These findings suggest that decisions about relocation 
should be accompanied by discussion of anticipated changes in quality of life 
and life expectancy.

The mevalonate pathway is responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol, coenzyme 
Q, and prenyl groups essential for small GTPase modification and function, and 
for the production of dolichols important for protein glycosylation. Statins, 
i.e., cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme in the 
mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, are lethal to Caenorhabditis elegans even 
though this animal lacks the branch of the mevalonate pathway that leads to 
cholesterol synthesis. To better understand the effects of statins that are not 
related to cholesterol, we have adopted the strategy of isolating 
statin-resistant C. elegans mutants. Previously, we showed that such mutants 
often have gain-of-function mutations in ATFS-1, a protein that activates the 
mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Here, we describe the isolation of a 
statin-resistant mutant allele of the NDUF-7 protein, which is a component of 
complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The novel nduf-7(et19) 
mutant also exhibits constitutive and ATFS-1-dependent activation of the 
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) and prolonged life span, both 
of which are mediated through production of ROS. Additionally, lifespan 
extension, but not activation, of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response 
was dependent on the pro-apoptotic gene ced-4. We conclude that the nduf-7(et19) 
mutant allele causes an increase in reactive oxygen species that activate 
ATFS-1, hence UPR(mt)-mediated statin resistance, and extends life span via 
CED-4.

[Financial burden of hepatitis C infection and its treatment].

[Article in Hungarian]

Makara M(1), Hunyady B.

The worldwide prevalence of hepatitis C infection is 2-3%. In addition to its 
individual consequences, it generates huge financial impact on national level. 
In particular, lack of recognition or late diagnosis of the disease is 
associated with high rate of liver cirrhosis related complications (hepatic 
encephalopathy, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma) and/or 
demands liver transplantation. Loss of quality assisted life years and/or those 
spent in employment, reduced work productivity, as well as costs of antiviral 
therapy also contribute to the financial burden. The costs of new 
interferon-free therapies may exceed the prices of previous pegylated interferon 
based therapies with or without protease inhibitors; however, shorter treatment 
durations and extremely low rates of severe side-effects with much less related 
expenses can reduce total costs of these treatments. In addition to the moral 
obligations, published cost-effectiveness analyses conclude that early diagnosis 
and treatment of this primarily iatrogenic infection through organized screening 
programs and wide access to effective therapies may lead to long term financial 
benefit.

Diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of hepatitis C virus related liver disease. 
Hungarian national consensus guideline.

[Article in Hungarian]

Approximately 70,000 people are infected with hepatitis C virus in Hungary, and 
more than half of them are not aware of their infection. From the point of 
infected individuals early recognition and effective treatment of related liver 
injury may prevent consequent advanced liver diseases and complications (liver 
cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer) and can increase work productivity 
and life expectancy. From a socioeconomic aspect, this could also prevent 
further spread of the virus as well as reduce substantially long term financial 
burden of related morbidity. Pegylated interferon + ribavirin dual therapy, 
which is available in Hungary since 2003, can clear the virus in 40-45% of 
previously not treated (naïve), and in 5-21% of previous treatment-failure 
patients. Addition of a direct acting first generation protease inhibitor drug 
(boceprevir or telaprevir) to the dual therapy increases the chance of sustained 
viral response to 63-75% and 59-66%, respectively. These two protease inhibitors 
are available and financed for a segment of Hungarian patients since May 2013. 
Between 2013 and February 2015, other direct acting antiviral interferon-free 
combination therapies have been registered for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis C, with a potential efficacy over 90% and typical short duration of 
8-12 weeks. Indication of therapy includes exclusion of contraindications to the 
drugs and demonstration of viral replication with consequent liver injury, i.e., 
inflammation and / or fibrosis in the liver. Non-invasive methods (elastography 
and biochemical methods) are accepted and preferred for staging liver damage 
(fibrosis). For initiation of treatment as well as for on-treatment decisions, 
accurate and timely molecular biology tests are mandatory. Eligibility for 
treatment is a subject of individual central medical review. Due to budget 
limitations therapy is covered only for a proportion of patients by the National 
Health Insurance Fund. Priority is given to those with urgent need based on a 
Hungarian Priority Index system reflecting primarily the stage of liver disease, 
and considering also additional factors, i.e., activity and progression of liver 
disease, predictive factors of treatment and other special issues. Approved 
treatments are restricted to the most cost-effective combinations based on the 
cost per sustained viral response value in different patient categories with 
consensus between professional organizations, National Health Insurance Fund and 
patient organizations. More expensive therapies might be available upon 
co-financing by the patient or a third party. Interferon-free treatments and 
shorter therapy durations preferred as much as financially feasible. A separate 
budget is allocated to cover interferon-free treatments for the most-in-need 
interferon ineligible/intolerant patients, and for those who have no more 
interferon-based therapy option. Orv. Hetil., 2015, 156(Suppl. 1), 3-23.

Diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis B and D. Hungarian national 
consensus guideline.

[Article in Hungarian]

Diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B and D virus infections mean that the 
patient is able to maintain working capacity, increase quality of life, prevent 
cancer, and prolong life expectancy, while the society benefits from eliminating 
the chances of further transmission of the viruses, and decreasing the overall 
costs of serious complications. The guideline delineates the treatment 
algorithms for 2015, which is agreed on a consensus meeting of specialists 
involved in the treatment of the above diseases. The prevalence of hepatitis B 
virus infection in the Hungarian general population is 0.5-0.7%. The indications 
of treatment is based upon viral examinations (including viral nucleic acid 
determination), determinations of disease activity and stage (including 
biochemical, pathologic, and/or non-invasive methods), and excluding 
contraindications. To avoid unnecessary side effects and for cost-effective 
approach the guideline emphasizes the importance of quick and detailed virologic 
evaluations, the applicability of transient elastography as an acceptable 
alternative of liver biopsy in this regard, as well as the relevance of 
appropriate consistent follow up schedule for viral response during therapy. The 
first choice of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection can be pegylated 
interferon for 48 weeks or continuous entecavir or tenofovir therapy. The latter 
two must be continued for at least 12 months after hepatitis B surface antigen 
seroconversion. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended mainly in combination therapy. 
Lamivudine is no longer a first choice; patients currently taking lamivudine 
must switch if response is inadequate. Appropriate treatment of patients taking 
immunosuppressive medications is highly recommended. Pegylated interferon based 
therapy is recommended for the treatment of concomitant hepatitis D infection.

Life expectancy and quality of life of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have been 
steadily increasing for many decades, due to intensified therapy and research. 
Correspondingly, the number of pregnancies in women with CF rises. Often it is 
not possible for the patients to assess the consequences of pregnancy in terms 
of their disease and the impact of their disease on the growing child. A 
pre-existing poor lung function, low body mass index, CF-related diabetes, 
chronic microbial colonisation, and transplanted lungs are the main risk factors 
for complications during pregnancy in CF. Generally, the best outcome for mother 
and child can be reached under exact planning and meshed multidisciplinary care. 
The purpose of this summary is to give a practical review of the risks and 
options associated with pregnancy in CF patients.

OBJECTIVE: Because most medical schools in the United States and Canada require 
no formal ophthalmology training, the authors queried medical student and 
ophthalmic patients to compare their perceptions of the quality of life (QOL) 
associated with vision loss.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study of consecutive medical students and 
patients with vision loss using a validated, reliable, time trade-off utility 
instrument.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive Jefferson Medical College medical students (cohort 1: 
145 second-year student; cohort 2: 112 third-year/fourth-year students) and 283 
patients with vision loss (patient cohort).
METHODS: Time trade-off vision utilities with anchors of 0.0 (death) to 1.0 
(normal vision permanently) were used to quantify the QOL associated with vision 
loss. Students were asked to assume they had: (i) mild vision loss (20/40 to 
20/50 vision in the better-seeing eye), (ii) legal blindness (20/200 in the 
better-seeing eye), and (iii) absolute blindness (no light perception 
bilaterally).
RESULTS: Mean utilities for cohort 1/cohort 2 were 0.96/0.95 (p = 0.20) for mild 
vision loss, 0.88/0.84 for legal blindness (p = 0.009), and 0.80/0.67 (p < 
0.0001) for absolute blindness. Medical student/patient mean utilities were 
0.96/0.79 (p < 0.0001) for mild vision loss, 0.85/0.62 for legal blindness (p < 
0.0001), and 0.74/0.26 (p < 0.0001) for absolute blindness. Overall, medical 
students underestimated the QOL associated with vision loss referent to patients 
with vision loss by 153%-425%.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical students dramatically underestimated the impact of vision 
loss on patient QOL. Clinical training slightly improved medical student 
perceptions. Trivialization of vision loss could result in systemic health harm, 
less ophthalmic research dollars, loss of the finest medical students entering 
ophthalmology, and overall adverse financial effects for the field.

BACKGROUND: The EQ-5D is one of the most frequently used, generic, 
preference-based instruments for measuring the health utilities of patients in 
economic evaluations. It is recommended for health technology assessment by the 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Because the EQ-5D plays 
such an important role in economic evaluations, useful information on its 
responsiveness to detect meaningful change in health status is required.
OBJECTIVE: This study systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on the 
responsiveness of the EQ-5D to detect meaningful change in health status for 
clinical research and economic evaluations.
METHODS: We searched the EuroQol website, PubMed, PsychINFO, and EconLit 
databases to identify studies published in English from the inception of the 
EQ-5D until August 15, 2014 using keywords that were related to responsiveness. 
Studies that used only the EQ-VAS were excluded from the final analysis. 
Narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize evidence on the responsiveness of 
the EQ-5D by conditions or physiological functions.
RESULTS: Of 1401 studies, 145 were included in the narrative synthesis and 
categorized into 19 categories for 56 conditions. The EQ-5D was found to be 
responsive in 25 conditions (45 %) with the magnitude of responsiveness varying 
from small to large depending on the condition. There was mixed evidence of 
responsiveness in 27 conditions (48 %). Only four conditions (7 %) (i.e., 
alcohol dependency, schizophrenia, limb reconstruction, and hearing impairment) 
were identified where the EQ-5D was not responsive.
CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D is an appropriate measure for economic evaluation and 
health technology assessment in conditions where it has demonstrated evidence of 
responsiveness. In conditions with mixed evidence of responsiveness, researchers 
should consider using the EQ-5D with other condition-specific measures to ensure 
appropriate estimates of effectiveness. These conditions should be a main focus 
for future research using the new EQ-5D version with five response levels.
