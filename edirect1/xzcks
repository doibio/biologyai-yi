among the most productive age group in West and Central Africa stood at 1.5%, 
3.4.0%, 2.5%, and 2.1% in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 respectively. This study 
examined the effect of HIV/AIDS on economic growth in West Africa with focus on 
11 countries. The augmented Solow model, rooted in the neoclassical growth 
theory, was used, which was operationalized using dynamic panel data modeling 
approach. Incidence, prevalence, number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), 
and AIDS-related deaths were used to measure HIV/AIDS. Estimations using system 
GMM returned statistically significant results while those of first difference 
and difference GMM were not. From the outcome of system GMM analysis, a 
percentage increase in incidence, prevalence, PLWHA, and AIDS deaths 
correspondingly reduced growth significantly through their effects on life 
expectancy by 0.15%, 0.02%, 0.004%, and 0.03%. Acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome deaths and PLWHA lowered economic growth through enrolment but not 
significantly. The import of the findings is that HIV/AIDS threatens growth 
through life expectancy in West Africa. Therefore, its spread in the subregion 
should be effectively contained while proper treatment should be provided for 
all infected persons.

This paper aims to improve the accuracy of parametric extrapolations of the 
death rates into old age by constraining the extrapolation model on presumed 
life expectancy at old age. Such a task is particularly important in cases where 
the data quality at old age, in particular the age exaggeration, is not 
sufficient for reliable mortality estimates. Our tests are based on period data 
from the Human Mortality Database and the use of the Horiuchi-Coale and Mitra 
formulas for reducing the bias of life expectancy in the open age interval. We 
show that extrapolation accuracy is substantially improved when the 
extrapolation is constrained by either the empirical life expectancy or the 
Horiuchi-Coale or Mitra estimates. Unconstrained extrapolations and those 
constrained by conventional life table estimates of life expectancy in the open 
age interval show substantial biases and should be avoided. Combining 
extrapolation with life expectancy estimates which are robust to the effects of 
age exaggeration appears to be a valuable way of improving mortality estimation.

factors, and mortality.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a sudden renal dysfunction with 
consequent increase of nitrogenous products, hydroelectrolytic and acid-base 
disorders. Its prevalence is high in hospitalized populations (4.9%-7.2%), 
especially in intensive care units (ICUs). Despite all the technical and 
therapeutic advances that have occurred in the last few decades, the overall 
mortality of AKI patients remains high, reaching 80% in ICU patients. Several 
conditions predispose a patient to progress with AKI, including age, sepsis, 
surgeries, and comorbidities, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, heart disease, neoplasia, and chronic renal disease. Among these risk 
factors, age is emphasized, since, due to advances in the health area, there has 
been an increase in life expectancy, hence an increase in the demand of the 
elderly population for health services. At the same time, the elderly present a 
greater predisposition to the development of AKI, either due to kidney senility, 
or because of the high prevalence of comorbidities present, and medical 
interventions such as the use of contrasts and medications, which can also 
trigger AKI. Considering the relevance of the social role of the elderly and the 
scarcity of studies on AKI in the elderly admitted to the ICU, further studies 
are needed. This review article was elaborated considering the purpose: to 
assess incidence, risk factors, and mortality of AKI in elderly patients 
admitted to ICUs. Published studies were collected using the following inclusion 
criteria: be accessible in online databases (Lilacs, Scielo, and PubMed), have 
been published since 2000 and written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. The 
descriptors used for the survey were "Acute Kidney Injury", "Aging", and 
"Elderly". All items that did not fit in the above inclusion criteria were 
discarded. We have also presented a synthesis of the knowledge acquired during 
this review.

Policy coherence to achieve the SDGs: using integrated simulation models to 
assess effective policies.

Coherently addressing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals requires planning 
tools that guide policy makers. Given the integrative nature of the SDGs, we 
believe that integrative modelling techniques are especially useful for this 
purpose. In this paper, we present and demonstrate the use of the new System 
Dynamics based iSDG family of models. We use a national model for Tanzania to 
analyse impacts of substantial investments in photovoltaic capacity. Our focus 
is on the impacts on three SDGs: SDG 3 on healthy lives and well-being, SDG 4 on 
education, and SDG 7 on energy. In our simulations, the investments in 
photovoltaics positively affect life expectancy, years of schooling and access 
to electricity. More importantly, the progress on these dimensions synergizes 
and leads to broader system-wide impacts. While this one national example 
illustrates the anticipated impact of an intervention in one specific area on 
several SDGs, the iSDG model can be used to support similar analyses for 
policies related to all the 17 SDGs, both individually and concurrently. We 
believe that integrated models such as the iSDG model can bring interlinks to 
the forefront and facilitate a shift to a discussion on development grounded in 
systems thinking.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been implanted recently, with 
increasing frequency, to treat advanced heart failure with good survival rates. 
Since heart failure is most prevalent in patients above 70 years of age, LVAD 
implantations are increasing particularly in this cohort. On the other hand, due 
to a higher incidence of malignant tumors in the elderly population, there is a 
significant cohort of patients having concurrent indications for LVAD 
implantation. Herein, we report a case of complicated gastric malignancy that 
was encountered soon after the implantation of an emergent LVAD with ensuing 
treatment difficulties and ethical considerations. Keeping in mind the fairly 
high life expectancy for both groups, there is a predisposition to the notion 
that simultaneous procedures can and should be applicable to a selected group of 
patients with end-stage heart failure.

The life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities (ID) has steadily 
increased, which has been accompanied by an increased risk of dementia. Staff 
and managers are key resources for safety diagnosis since they deliver 
information about people with ID behavior every day. The aim of the present 
study was to explore the identification process employed by staff and managers 
to detect signs of suspected dementia in people with an ID within intellectual 
disability services (ID-services). Twenty managers and 24 staff within an 
ID-service were interviewed and qualitative latent content analysis was applied. 
A model consisting of three themes on three levels of resources for the 
identification process of signs of suspected dementia emerged from the analysis. 
On the first level was the time and continuity in the care relationship, which 
is crucial for identifying and responding to changes in cognitive ability that 
indicate dementia. On the second level, the staff identify deficiencies in their 
own knowledge, seek support from colleagues and managers within their workplace 
and, on the third level, outside their workplace. Staff and managers expressed a 
need for early and continuous guidance and education from specialists in 
dementia and primary healthcare. This finding indicates an urgent need for 
intervention research and digital support for staff in dementia care.

Morchella is a popular edible fungus worldwide due to its rich nutrition and 
unique flavor. Many research efforts were made on the domestication and 
cultivation of Morchella all over the world. In recent years, the cultivation of 
Morchella was successfully commercialized in China. However, the biology is not 
well understood, which restricts the further development of the morel fungus 
cultivation industry. In this paper, we performed de novo sequencing and 
assembly of the genomes of two monospores with a different mating type (M04M24 
and M04M26) isolated from the commercially cultivated strain M04. Gene 
annotation and comparative genome analysis were performed to study differences 
in CAZyme (Carbohydrate-active enzyme) enzyme content, transcription factors, 
duplicated sequences, structure of mating type sites, and differences at the 
gene and functional levels between the two monospore strains of M. importuna. 
Results showed that the de novo assembled haploid M04M24 and M04M26 genomes were 
48.98 and 51.07 Mb, respectively. A complete fine physical map of M. importuna 
was obtained from genome coverage and gene completeness evaluation. A total of 
10,852 and 10,902 common genes and 667 and 868 endemic genes were identified 
from the two monospore strains, respectively. The Gene Ontology (GO) and KAAS 
(KEGG Automatic Annotation Serve) enrichment analyses showed that the endemic 
genes performed different functions. The two monospore strains had 99.22% 
collinearity with each other, accompanied with certain position and 
rearrangement events. Analysis of complete mating-type loci revealed that the 
two monospore M. importuna strains contained an independent mating-type 
structure and remained conserved in sequence and location. The phylogenetic and 
divergence time of M. importuna was analyzed at the whole-genome level for the 
first time. The bifurcation time of morel and tuber was estimated to be 201.14 
million years ago (Mya); the two monospore strains with a different mating type 
represented the evolution of different nuclei, and the single copy homologous 
genes between them were also different due to a genetic differentiation distance 
about 0.65 Mya. Compared with truffles, M. importuna had an extension of 28 
clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) and a contraction of two COGs. The two 
different polar nuclei with different degrees of contraction and expansion 
suggested that they might have undergone different evolutionary processes. The 
different mating-type structures, together with the functional clustering and 
enrichment analysis results of the endemic genes of the two different polar 
nuclei, imply that M. importuna might be a heterothallic fungus and the 
interaction between the endemic genes may be necessary for its complete life 
history. Studies on the genome of M. importuna facilitate a better understanding 
of morel biology and evolution.

In this work, the effect of the addition of olive leaf extracts on the quality 
of vacuum-packed salmon burgers stored at 4 ℃ during 16 days has been studied. 
Olive leaf extract and its hydrolysate were initially characterized and then 
incorporated to salmon burgers. A shelf life study was conducted in three 
different batches (control, olive leaf extract, and hydrolyzed olive leaf 
extract burgers). Among the chemical indices determined, total volatile base 
nitrogen values were lower in hydrolyzed olive leaf extract and olive leaf 
extract burgers than in control samples. Lipid oxidation was lower in salmon 
burger with olive leaf extract. Salmon mince treated with hydrolyzed olive leaf 
extract showed lower microbial counts during the whole study, which extended the 
shelf life of the fish product. Therefore, the potential of olive leaf extracts 
to preserve salmon burgers during cold storage has been demonstrated.

Masseter and temporalis muscle transfer is an effective technique for restoring 
facial symmetry and commissure excursion in flaccid facial paralysis. Adherence 
to the principles and biomechanics of muscle transfer is essential for achieving 
optimal results. Muscle transfer has the advantage of being single staged with 
fast recovery of function. It is particularly useful in patients with low life 
expectancy or multiple comorbidities where a more complex, multiple stage 
procedure may be detrimental.

With an expanding elderly population and median rectal cancer detection age of 
70 years, the prevalence of rectal cancer in elderly patients is increasing. 
Management is based on evidence from younger patients, resulting in substandard 
treatments and poor outcomes. Modern management of rectal cancer in the elderly 
demands patient-centered treatment, assessing frailty rather than chronological 
age. The heterogeneity of this group, combined with the limited available data, 
impedes drafting evidence-based guidelines. Therefore, a multidisciplinary task 
force convened experts from the European Society of Surgical Oncology, European 
Society of Coloproctology, International Society of Geriatric Oncology and the 
American College Surgeons Commission on Cancer, with the goal of identifying the 
best practice to promote personalized rectal cancer care in older patients. A 
crucial element for personalized care was recognized as the routine screening 
for frailty and geriatrician involvement and personalized care for frail 
patients. Careful patient selection and improved surgical and perioperative 
techniques are responsible for a substantial improvement in rectal cancer 
outcomes. Therefore, properly selected patients should be considered for 
surgical resection. Local excision can be utilized when balancing oncologic 
outcomes, frailty and life expectancy. Watch and wait protocols, in expert 
hands, are valuable for selected patients and adjuncts can be added to improve 
complete response rates. Functional recovery and patient-reported outcomes are 
as important as oncologic-specific outcomes in this age group. The above 
recommendations and others were made based on the best-available evidence to 
guide the personalized treatment of elderly patients with rectal cancer.

The viruses that infect bacteria, known as phages, play a critical role in 
controlling bacterial populations in many diverse environments, including the 
human body. This control stems not only from phages killing bacteria but also 
from the formation of lysogens. In this state, the phage replication cycle is 
suppressed, and the phage genome is maintained in the bacterial cell in a form 
known as a prophage. Prophages often carry genes that benefit the host bacterial 
cell, since increasing the survival of the host cell by extension also increases 
the fitness of the prophage. These highly diverse and beneficial phage genes, 
which are not required for the life cycle of the phage itself, have been 
referred to as "morons," as their presence adds "more on" the phage genome in 
which they are found. While individual phage morons have been shown to 
contribute to bacterial virulence by a number of different mechanisms, there 
have been no systematic investigations of their activities. Using a library of 
phages that infect two different clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, PAO1 and 
PA14, we compared the phenotypes imparted by the expression of individual phage 
morons. We identified morons that inhibit twitching and swimming motilities and 
observed an inhibition of the production of virulence factors such as 
rhamnolipids and elastase. This study demonstrates the scope of phage-mediated 
phenotypic changes and provides a framework for future studies of phage 
morons.IMPORTANCE Environmental and clinical isolates of the bacterium 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently contain viruses known as prophages. These 
prophages can alter the virulence of their bacterial hosts through the 
expression of nonessential genes known as "morons." In this study, we identified 
morons in a group of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and characterized the effects 
of their expression on bacterial behaviors. We found that many morons confer 
selective advantages for the bacterial host, some of which correlate with 
increased bacterial virulence. This work highlights the symbiotic relationship 
between bacteria and prophages and illustrates how phage morons can help 
bacteria adapt to different selective pressures and contribute to human

Convenience foods like chilled meat usually have a short shelf life. Modified 
atmosphere packaging (MAP) can be used together with refrigeration to retard 
meat degradation. This work evaluated the effect of MAP on the preservation and 
consumers acceptance of lamb meat. Lamb loins Longissimus lumborum were packed 
in five conditions: 15% O2 + 85% CO2 (O15), 30% O2 + 70% CO2 (O30), 45% O2 + 55% 
CO2 (O45), 60% O2 + 40% CO2 (O60), and Vacuum (control). Physicochemical, 
sensory, and microbiological analyses were carried out along 21 days of 
refrigerated (1 ± 1 °C) storage. Treatments O30, O45 and vacuum presented the 
lowest oxidation values: 0.60, 0.61 and 0.30 Malonaldehyde Kg-1 respectively. 
Treatment O45 showed the highest a* until the seventh day of storage (16.64). In 
the sensory preference ranking test, O30 and O45 received best scores in the 
first and second weeks of storage, respectively. Treatments O30 and O45 
delivered products with lower microbial counts than the other ones. Considering 
a balance between consumer preference and microbiological results, we propose 
the use of 45% O2 + 55% CO2 gas composition to extend the shelf life of lamb 
loin.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Fallopian tube cancer is very rare in the literature and so 
there are not enough data about the therapeutic approaches. The approaches are 
generally determined in accordance with the data obtained from ovarian cancer. 
Many prognostic factors have been investigated in an effort to better estimate 
patient outcome. Stage, age, and residual tumor after surgery are consistently 
important prognostic factors. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic 
factors and survival rates of primary fallopian tube cancer (PFTC), which is 
rare among gynecological cancers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with a diagnosis of PFTC were 
identified through the gynecologic oncology service database of our Research and 
Training Hospital in the period 1995-2013. Clinicopathological and surgical data 
were collected. All patients were evaluated for survival and disease-free 
survival between the dates specified.
RESULTS: A significant relationship and correlation was found between optimal 
surgery and life expectancy. Better results were obtained in patients treated 
with optimal surgery. The survival probability was found to be higher in 
patients with lower CA-125 levels and serous histologic type adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Stage is one of the factors affecting the survival probability. We 
determined that the pathological type of tumor, the diameter of residual tumor 
remaining after surgery, tumor grade, preoperative CA-125 levels and presence of 
ascites affect the survival probability.

BACKGROUND: The increasing age of the population and prolonged life expectancy 
result in a widening of age limit criteria for a variety of surgical procedures. 
Oesophagectomy and total gastrectomy are complex operations associated with 
significant risks of post-operative complications.
METHODS: This is a single-centre cohort study of patients operated with curative 
intent due to oesophageal or gastric cancer.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2017, 548 patients underwent surgery with curative intent, 
with 122 patients (22.3%) classified as elderly (≥75 years). There was no 
difference in total complication rates between the groups. The adjusted odds 
ratio for 90-day mortality after oesophageal resection in the elderly group was 
3.65 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-10.03) and after gastrectomy was 1.62 
(95% CI: 0.55-4.79). The adjusted hazard ratio for 1-year mortality after 
oesophagectomy was 2.29 (95% CI: 1.25-4.19), and after gastrectomy the adjusted 
hazard ratio was 1.48 (95% CI: 0.75-2.92). In the event of a complication with 
Clavien-Dindo score IIIb or higher, there was a statistically significant 
increase of 90-day mortality to over 50% among elderly patients both after 
oesophagectomy and gastrectomy (50.0% versus 19.8%; P = 0.005 and 57.1% versus 
17.4%; P = 0.012, respectively).
CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant increase in 90-day mortality 
after oesophageal and gastric cancer surgery in elderly compared with younger 
patients. Post-operative complications with high Clavien-Dindo score in patients 
undergoing oesophagectomy or gastrectomy, with age ≥75 years, are a dramatic 
risk factor for post-operative death.

BACKGROUND: Nutrition medical education training programs that are focused on 
home cooking are emerging.
OBJECTIVE: This short communication describes the first synchronous 
tele-nutrition medical education training program using a novel Culinary 
Coaching (CC) model.
DESIGN: Seven health coaches were trained and each coach delivered CC programs 
to four patients (28 total). Evaluations included:1) two questionnaires before, 
immediately after, and six months post training program; and 2) one 
questionnaire after each patient program.
RESULTS: CC training significantly improved coaches' attitudes about and 
confidence to deliver CC from pre-program means of 3.61 and 3.65 (out of 5), 
respectively, to post-program means, 3.77 (p<0.01) and 3.86 (p<0.05), 
respectively, and remained higher 6 months after the training program (3.93, 
p<0.01; 3.93, p<0.05). Health coaches described a high usage of CC principles 
and tools through the patient programs.
CONCLUSIONS: This early evidence suggests that the CC model can be successfully 
expanded to health coaches, thus improving nutritional care.

BACKGROUND: Remote patient management in patients with heart failure might help 
to detect early signs and symptoms of cardiac decompensation, thus enabling a 
prompt initiation of the appropriate treatment and care before a full 
manifestation of a heart failure decompensation. We aimed to investigate the 
efficacy of our remote patient management intervention on mortality and 
morbidity in a well defined heart failure population.
METHODS: The Telemedical Interventional Management in Heart Failure II (TIM-HF2) 
trial was a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel-group, unmasked (with 
randomisation concealment), multicentre trial with pragmatic elements introduced 
for data collection. The trial was done in Germany, and patients were recruited 
from hospitals and cardiology practices. Eligible patients had heart failure, 
were in New York Heart Association class II or III, had been admitted to 
hospital for heart failure within 12 months before randomisation, and had a left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% or lower (or if higher than 45%, 
oral diuretics were being prescribed). Patients with major depression were 
excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a secure web-based system 
to either remote patient management plus usual care or to usual care only and 
were followed up for a maximum of 393 days. The primary outcome was percentage 
of days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospital admissions or all-cause 
death, analysed in the full analysis set. Key secondary outcomes were all-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01878630, and has now been completed.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 13, 2013, and May 12, 2017, 1571 patients were randomly 
assigned to remote patient management (n=796) or usual care (n=775). Of these 
1571 patients, 765 in the remote patient management group and 773 in the usual 
care group started their assigned care, and were included in the full analysis 
set. The percentage of days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospital 
admissions and all-cause death was 4·88% (95% CI 4·55-5·23) in the remote 
patient management group and 6·64% (6·19-7·13) in the usual care group (ratio 
0·80, 95% CI 0·65-1·00; p=0·0460). Patients assigned to remote patient 
management lost a mean of 17·8 days (95% CI 16·6-19·1) per year compared with 
24·2 days (22·6-26·0) per year for patients assigned to usual care. The 
all-cause death rate was 7·86 (95% CI 6·14-10·10) per 100 person-years of 
follow-up in the remote patient management group compared with 11·34 
(9·21-13·95) per 100 person-years of follow-up in the usual care group (hazard 
ratio [HR] 0·70, 95% CI 0·50-0·96; p=0·0280). Cardiovascular mortality was not 
significantly different between the two groups (HR 0·671, 95% CI 0·45-1·01; 
p=0·0560).
INTERPRETATION: The TIM-HF2 trial suggests that a structured remote patient 
management intervention, when used in a well defined heart failure population, 
could reduce the percentage of days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular 
hospital admissions and all-cause mortality.

As long-term changes in life expectancy and fertility drive the emergence of 
aging societies across the globe, individual countries vary widely in the 
development of age-relevant policies and programs. While failure to adapt to the 
demographic transformation carries not only important financial risks but also 
social risks, most efforts to gauge countries' preparedness focus on economic 
indicators. Using data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) and other sources, we developed a multidimensional Aging 
Society Index that assesses the status of older populations across five specific 
domains, including productivity and engagement, well-being, equity, economic and 
physical security, and intergenerational cohesion. For 18 OECD countries, the 
results demonstrate substantial diversity in countries' progress in adapting to 
aging. For any given domain, there are wide differences across countries, and 
within most countries, there is substantial variation across domains. Overall, 
Norway and Sweden rank first in adaptation to aging, followed by the United 
States, The Netherlands, and Japan. Central and eastern European countries rank 
at the bottom, with huge untapped potential for successful aging. The United 
States ranks best in productivity and engagement, in the top half for cohesion, 
and in the middle in well-being, but it ranks third from the bottom in equity. 
Only well-being and security showed significant between-domain correlation (r = 
0.59, P = 0.011), strengthening the case for a multidimensional index. 
Examination of heterogeneity within and across domains of the index can be used 
to assess the need for, and effectiveness of, various programs and policies and 
facilitate successful adaptation to the demographic transition.

Over the past decade, remarkable breakthroughs in our understanding of 
epigenetic biology have coincided with an increased public interest in the 
impact of diet and lifestyle choices on health. It is well established that a 
balanced diet enhances life expectancy and helps to prevent or treat certain 
diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and mental disorders. However, the 
biological mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet well understood. In 
this commentary, we highlight several recent studies that report on a potential 
link between dietary factors and alterations in epigenetic pathways, providing 
compelling insight into the possible effects of environmental factors on 
fundamental biological processes.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is 10-20 years lower in patients with schizophrenia 
than in the general population. In addition, men with schizophrenia have an 
earlier age at onset, more pronounced deficit symptoms, poorer course, and 
poorer response to antipsychotic medications than women. Recent studies have 
indicated that loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in peripheral blood is associated with 
an increased risk of all-cause mortality. In order to elucidate the 
pathophysiology of male-specific features, we investigated the association 
between LOY and schizophrenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 360 Japanese men (146 patients 
with schizophrenia vs 214 controls). The relative amount of Y chromosome was 
defined as the ratio of chromosome Y to chromosome X (Y/X ratio) based on the 
fluorescent signal of co-amplified short sequences from the Y-X homologous 
amelogenin genes (AMELY and AMELX).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the frequency of LOY between the 
schizophrenia and control groups. However, longer duration of illness was 
associated with LOY after controlling for age and smoking status in the 
schizophrenia group (P=0.007, OR =1.11 [95% CI =1.03-1.19]).
CONCLUSION: According to our results, schizophrenia may not have a remarkable 
effect on blood LOY; however, LOY may be associated with disease course in 
patients with schizophrenia.
