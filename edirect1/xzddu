Scholarship on families in poverty, in the last decade, documented various 
struggles and challenges faced by low-income families and expanded our 
understanding of their complicated life circumstances embedded within the 
contexts of community, culture, and policies. The research articles published in 
the Journal of Family and Economic Issues during this time, that highlighted 
poverty, focused primarily on three topic areas: economic security, family life 
issues, and food security. Overall, findings conclude that family well-being and 
stability cannot be promoted without the consideration of environmental factors. 
They depend on the interaction among individual (e.g., increased human capital), 
family (e.g., positive co-parental relationship), community (e.g., affordable 
childcare), and policy changes (e.g., realistic welfare-to-work programs). 
Collectively, the articles have provided a road map for future research 
directions.

Thermotolerance of an organism is a complex trait that is influenced by a 
multitude of genetic and environmental factors. Many factors controlling 
thermotolerance in Caenorhabditis elegans are known to extend life. To 
understand the regulation of thermotolerance, we performed a genetic screen for 
mutants with better survival at warm temperature. Here we identified by dauer 
survival a tax-2 mutation and several mutations disrupting an insulin signaling 
pathway including the daf-2 gene. While the tax-2 mutant has improved 
thermotolerance and long life span, the newly identified daf-2 and other insulin 
signaling mutants, unlike the canonical daf-2(e1370), do not show improved 
thermotolerance despite being long-lived. Examination of tax-2 mutations and 
their mutant phenotypes suggest that the control of thermotolerance is not 
coupled with the control of life span or dauer survival. With genetic 
interaction studies, we concluded that tax-2 has complex roles in life span and 
dauer survival and that tax-2 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance 
independent of other known thermotolerance genes including those in the insulin 
signaling pathway. Moreover, cold growth temperature during development weakens 
the improved thermotolerance associated with tax-2 and other 
thermotolerance-inducing mutations. Together, this study reveals previously 
unknown genetic and environmental factors controlling thermotolerance and their 
complex relationship with life span regulation.

Blunt vascular trauma is rare and challenging in management. Trauma victims who 
are elderly and have medical comorbidities are still uncommon, but their 
proportion is expected to increase, as life expectancy has been rising 
worldwide. A case of blunt vascular trauma to the lower extremity in a 
70-year-old patient is reported. During the procedure, a contusion of the 
superficial femoral artery with thrombosis was identified. Besides, the artery 
was found to be affected by atherosclerosis. Thrombectomy with resection of the 
artery and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Good early clinical outcome was 
achieved. Nonsystematic review of the available literature is also presented.

The casting method was employed to prepare gelatin-based nanocomposite films 
containing different concentrations of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a 
reinforcement filler (2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% w/w of gelatin) as well as zinc oxide 
nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as an antimicrobial agent (1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% w/w of 
gelatin). The results showed that the incorporation of 5% CNFs (optimum 
concentration) significantly boosted the films' stiffness (YM; by 47%) and 
strength (TS; by 72%) but decreased its flexibility (EAB; by 28%), water vapor 
permeability, and moisture absorption. The best G/CNF film antibacterial 
activity was provided by the 5% concentration of ZnO NPs according to the disk 
diffusion assay; Gram-positive bacteria were inhibited significantly more than 
Gram-negative bacteria. The antimicrobial efficacy of the G/CNF/ZnO NPs film as 
a food packaging material was assessed via counts of Staphylococcus aureus and 
Pseudomonas fluorescens inoculated on chicken fillets (as a food model) in the 
treatment (G/5% CNF/5% ZnO) and control groups (plastic bag). The antibacterial 
film led to a significant reduction in the bacterial load of the chicken fillets 
(p < .05), especially against the Gram-positive strain. This study illustrated 
that G/CNF/ZnO NPs films can be utilized as active packaging to prolong the 
shelf life of different perishable foods such as meat.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency syndrome that 
results in increased risk for bacterial and fungal infections, as well as 
inflammatory/autoimmune complications. While CGD historically has been 
associated with early death in childhood, the life expectancy and morbidity of 
patients with CGD have greatly improved. Many patients with CGD now survive well 
into adulthood, and data on adult cohorts of patients with CGD have been 
published. However, reports of pregnancy management, complications, and outcomes 
for patients with CGD are sparse. In addition, management of invasive fungal 
infections, including use of newer triazole antifungals, during pregnancy has 
not been well described. We report a case of fungal lung infection in a pregnant 
woman with CGD, diagnosed during her second trimester, which was treated with 
multiple antifungal agents, including more than 12 weeks of isavuconazole 
therapy, resulting in resolution of infection and delivery of a healthy newborn 
at term.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about disparities in economic burden due to 
premature cancer deaths by race or ethnicity in the United States. This study 
aimed to compare person-years of life lost (PYLLs) and lost earnings due to 
premature cancer deaths by race/ethnicity.
METHODS: PYLLs were calculated using recent national cancer death and life 
expectancy data. PYLLs were combined with annual median earnings to generate 
lost earnings. We compared PYLLs and lost earnings among individuals who died at 
age 16-84 years due to cancer by racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic [NH] White, 
NH Black, NH Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic).
RESULTS: In 2015, PYLLs due to all premature cancer deaths were 6 512 810 for NH 
Whites, 1 196 709 for NH Blacks, 279 721 for NH Asian or Pacific Islanders, and 
665 968 for Hispanics, translating to age-standardized lost earning rates (per 
100 000 person-years) of $34.9 million, $43.5 million, $22.2 million, and $24.5 
million, respectively. NH Blacks had higher age-standardized PYLL and lost 
earning rates than NH Whites for 13 of 19 selected cancer sites. If age-specific 
PYLL and lost earning rates for NH Blacks were the same as those of NH Whites, 
241 334 PYLLs and $3.2 billion lost earnings (22.6% of the total lost earnings 
among NH Blacks) would have been avoided. Disparities were also observed for 
average PYLLs and lost earnings per cancer death for all cancers combined and 18 
of 19 cancer sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving equal access to effective cancer prevention, screening, 
and treatment will be important in reducing the disproportional economic burden 
associated with racial/ethnic disparities.

OBJECTIVES: The value of early detection and treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently unknown. We assessed the cost 
effectiveness of primary care-based case detection strategies for COPD.
METHODS: A previously validated discrete event simulation model of the general 
population of COPD patients in Canada was used to assess the cost effectiveness 
of 16 case detection strategies. In these strategies, eligible patients (based 
on age, smoking history, or symptoms) received the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire 
(CDQ) or screening spirometry, at 3- or 5-year intervals, during routine visits 
to a primary care physician. Newly diagnosed patients received treatment for 
smoking cessation and guideline-based inhaler pharmacotherapy. Analyses were 
conducted over a 20-year time horizon from the healthcare payer perspective. 
Costs are in 2019 Canadian dollars ($). Key treatment parameters were varied in 
one-way sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to no case detection, all 16 case detection scenarios had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below $50,000/QALY gained. In the 
most efficient scenario, all patients aged ≥ 40 years received the CDQ at 3-year 
intervals. This scenario was associated with an incremental cost of $287 and 
incremental effectiveness of 0.015 QALYs per eligible patient over the 20-year 
time horizon, resulting in an ICER of $19,632/QALY compared to no case 
detection. Results were most sensitive to the impact of treatment on the 
symptoms of newly diagnosed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care-based case detection programs for COPD are likely to 
be cost effective if there is adherence to best-practice recommendations for 
treatment, which can alleviate symptoms in newly diagnosed patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The routine use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage in 
patients undergoing operative repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA) has 
been associated with decreased rates of spinal cord ischemia. The use of CSF 
drains is not without consequence, however with complications including 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, meningitis, and, in 1% of cases, 
death. To date, a decision analysis tool to help clinicians decide when to use 
and not to use a CSF drain does not exist. In this analysis, we set out to 
develop a decision analysis tool for CSF drain placement in patients undergoing 
operative repair of TAAA.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition cohort model that compared TAAA repair with 
adjunctive CSF drain insertion to TAAA repair without drain insertion for the 
outcome of life expectancy was developed in TreeAge 2020. The cycle length was 1 
month and the time horizon was 60 months.
RESULTS: The use of a CSF drain was associated with improved 5-year life 
expectancy (3.21 ± 0.10 vs. 3.09 ± 0.11 life-years gained). In the sensitivity 
analysis that varied the effectiveness of a CSF drain (odds ratio closer to 
1 = less effective), the use of a CSF drain resulted in higher life expectancy 
in almost all scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of a CSF drain in patients undergoing TAAA repair 
is safe and effective, with few exceptions. This decision analysis tool can be 
used by clinicians to develop a personalized approach.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 12-week Exercise Physiology 
(EP) program for people living in a residential aged care facility.
METHODS: A within-study pre- and postintervention design to calculate 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life years gained. A 
health service provider perspective was used.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants enrolled in a 12-week program. The program cost 
was A$514.30 per resident. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of A$64 000, the 
likelihood of being cost-effective of the program is approximately 60%, due to a 
small increase in participants' quality of life, as reported by care staff. The 
model showed great variance, depending on who rated the participants' quality of 
life outcomes.
CONCLUSION: It is uncertain that a 12-week EP program is cost-effective based on 
the evidence of the current trial. However, it appears that a low-cost program 
can produce small improvements for residents in care facilities.

AIMS: This study aims to investigate the effects of posterior tibial slope (PTS) 
on knee kinematics involved in the post-cam mechanism in bi-cruciate stabilized 
(BCS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using computer simulation.
METHODS: In total, 11 different PTS (0° to 10°) values were simulated to 
evaluate the effect of PTS on anterior post-cam contact conditions and knee 
kinematics in BCS TKA during weight-bearing stair climbing (from 86° to 6° of 
knee flexion). Knee kinematics were expressed as the lowest points of the medial 
and lateral femoral condyles on the surface of the tibial insert, and the 
anteroposterior translation of the femoral component relative to the tibial 
insert.
RESULTS: Anterior post-cam contact in BCS TKA was observed with the knee near 
full extension if PTS was 6° or more. BCS TKA showed a bicondylar roll forward 
movement from 86° to mid-flexion, and two different patterns from mid-flexion to 
knee extension: screw home movement without anterior post-cam contact and 
bicondylar roll forward movement after anterior post-cam contact. Knee 
kinematics in the simulation showed similar trends to the clinical in vivo data 
and were almost within the range of inter-specimen variability.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative knee kinematics in BCS TKA differed according to PTS 
and anterior post-cam contact; in particular, anterior post-cam contact changed 
knee kinematics, which may affect the patient's perception of the knee during 
activities. Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2020;9(11):761-767.

IMPORTANCE: Accurate and up-to-date estimates on incidence, prevalence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (burden) of neurological disorders 
are the backbone of evidence-based health care planning and resource allocation 
for these disorders. It appears that no such estimates have been reported at the 
state level for the US.
OBJECTIVE: To present burden estimates of major neurological disorders in the US 
states by age and sex from 1990 to 2017.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a systematic analysis of the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of major neurological disorders were 
derived from the GBD 2017 study of the 48 contiguous US states, Alaska, and 
Hawaii. Fourteen major neurological disorders were analyzed: stroke, Alzheimer 
disease and other dementias, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, 
motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, traumatic brain injury, 
spinal cord injuries, brain and other nervous system cancers, meningitis, 
encephalitis, and tetanus.
EXPOSURES: Any of the 14 listed neurological diseases.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Absolute numbers in detail by age and sex and 
age-standardized rates (with 95% uncertainty intervals) were calculated.
RESULTS: The 3 most burdensome neurological disorders in the US in terms of 
absolute number of DALYs were stroke (3.58 [95% uncertainty interval [UI], 
3.25-3.92] million DALYs), Alzheimer disease and other dementias (2.55 [95% UI, 
2.43-2.68] million DALYs), and migraine (2.40 [95% UI, 1.53-3.44] million 
DALYs). The burden of almost all neurological disorders (in terms of absolute 
number of incident, prevalent, and fatal cases, as well as DALYs) increased from 
1990 to 2017, largely because of the aging of the population. Exceptions for 
this trend included traumatic brain injury incidence (-29.1% [95% UI, -32.4% to 
-25.8%]); spinal cord injury prevalence (-38.5% [95% UI, -43.1% to -34.0%]); 
meningitis prevalence (-44.8% [95% UI, -47.3% to -42.3%]), deaths (-64.4% [95% 
UI, -67.7% to -50.3%]), and DALYs (-66.9% [95% UI, -70.1% to -55.9%]); and 
encephalitis DALYs (-25.8% [95% UI, -30.7% to -5.8%]). The different metrics of 
age-standardized rates varied between the US states from a 1.2-fold difference 
for tension-type headache to 7.5-fold for tetanus; southeastern states and 
Arkansas had a relatively higher burden for stroke, while northern states had a 
relatively higher burden of multiple sclerosis and eastern states had higher 
rates of Parkinson disease, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine and tension-type 
headache, and meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is a large and increasing burden of 
noncommunicable neurological disorders in the US, with up to a 5-fold variation 
in the burden of and trends in particular neurological disorders across the US 
states. The information reported in this article can be used by health care 
professionals and policy makers at the national and state levels to advance 
their health care planning and resource allocation to prevent and reduce the 
burden of neurological disorders.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 2021 Jan;174(1):109-110.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important tool for informing 
treatment coverage and pricing decisions, yet no consensus exists about what 
threshold for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained indicates whether treatments are likely 
to be cost-effective in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate a U.S. cost-effectiveness threshold based on health 
opportunity costs.
DESIGN: Simulation of short-term mortality and morbidity attributable to persons 
dropping health insurance due to increased health care expenditures passed 
though as premium increases. Model inputs came from demographic data and the 
literature; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were constructed.
SETTING: Population-based.
PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohort of 100 000 individuals from the U.S. population 
with direct-purchase private health insurance.
MEASUREMENTS: Number of persons dropping insurance coverage, number of 
additional deaths, and QALYs lost from increased mortality and morbidity, all 
per increase of $10 000 000 (2019 U.S. dollars) in population treatment cost.
RESULTS: Per $10 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1860 persons (95% 
UI, 1080 to 2840 persons) were simulated to become uninsured, causing 5 deaths 
(UI, 3 to 11 deaths), 81 QALYs (UI, 40 to 170 QALYs) lost due to death, and 15 
QALYs (UI, 6 to 32 QALYs) lost due to illness; this implies a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of $104 000 per QALY (UI, $51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 U.S. 
dollars. Given available evidence, there is about 14% probability that the 
threshold exceeds $150 000 per QALY and about 48% probability that it lies below 
$100 000 per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Estimates were sensitive to inputs, most notably the effects of 
losing insurance on mortality and of premium increases on becoming uninsured. 
Health opportunity costs may vary by population. Nonhealth opportunity costs 
were excluded.
CONCLUSION: Given current evidence, treatments with ICERs above the range 
$100 000 to $150 000 per QALY are unlikely to be cost-effective in the United 
States.

OBJECTIVE: To compare direct costs and treatment utility associated with the 
second-line therapy with rituximab and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) 
(adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab) in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis 
(RA) using data from a prospective registry.
METHODS: Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores and 
RA-related healthcare resource utilization data (biologic agents and visits to 
rheumatologists) were extracted from a registry (Quebec, Canada) for patients 
with RA (n = 129) who had to discontinue a first-line TNFi and were treated with 
rituximab, adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab as the second-line therapy 
between January 2007 and May 2016. A decision analytic model followed patients 
for 1 and 6 years. Treatment utility was measured as quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained, which were calculated from HAQ-DI scores observed over the 
follow-up time. Quebec 2020 unit costs (Canadian Dollars, $) were used to value 
healthcare resource consumption. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess uncertainty around 
point-estimates of cost-utility.
RESULTS: Over 1-year, rituximab and etanercept resulted in the effectiveness of 
0.80 QALYs gained at the cost of $14,291and $18,880, respectively, and were 
dominant (i.e. associated with lower costs and more QALYs gained) compared to 
adalimumab (0.79 QALYs, $18,825) and infliximab (0.76 QALYs, $20,158). Over 
6-years, rituximab (4.42 QALYs, $82,402) was dominant compared to adalimumab 
(4.30 QALYs, $101,420), etanercept (4.02 QALYs, $99,191), and infliximab (3.71 
QALYs, $100,396). In the probabilistic analysis, rituximab was dominant over 
adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab with the probability of 0.51, 0.62, and 
0.65, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Real-world data revealed differences between alternative biologic 
agents used as the second-line therapy in terms of both treatment costs for the 
healthcare system and utility of treatment for patients. Therefore, new 
guidelines on the order of selecting and switching biologic agents should be 
explored.

BACKGROUND: trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are a well-known risk factor of ischemic 
heart disease (IHD). In Australia, the highest TFA intake is concentrated to the 
most socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Elimination of industrial TFA 
(iTFA) from the Australian food supply could result in reduced IHD mortality and 
morbidity while improving health equity. However, such legislation could lead to 
additional costs for both government and food industry. Thus, we assessed the 
potential cost-effectiveness, health gains, and effects on health equality of an 
iTFA ban from the Australian food supply.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Markov cohort models were used to estimate the impact on 
IHD burden and health equity, as well as the cost-effectiveness of a national 
ban of iTFA in Australia. Intake of TFA was assessed using the 2011-2012 
Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. The IHD burden 
attributable to TFA was calculated by comparing the current level of TFA intake 
to a counterfactual setting where consumption was lowered to a theoretical 
minimum distribution with a mean of 0.5% energy per day (corresponding to TFA 
intake only from nonindustrial sources, e.g., dairy foods). Policy costs, 
avoided IHD events and deaths, health-adjusted life years (HALYs) gained, and 
changes in IHD-related healthcare costs saved were estimated over 10 years and 
lifetime of the adult Australian population. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by 
calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using net policy 
cost and HALYs gained. Health benefits and healthcare cost changes were also 
assessed in subgroups based on socioeconomic status, defined by Socio-Economic 
Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) quintile, and remoteness. Compared to a base case of 
no ban and current TFA intakes, elimination of iTFA was estimated to prevent 
2,294 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 1,765; 2,851) IHD deaths and 9,931 (95% 
UI: 8,429; 11,532) IHD events over the first 10 years. The greatest health 
benefits were accrued to the most socioeconomically disadvantaged quintiles and 
among Australians living outside of major cities. The intervention was estimated 
to be cost saving (net cost <0 AUD) or cost-effective (i.e., ICER < AUD 
169,361/HALY) regardless of the time horizon, with ICERs of 1,073 (95% UI: 
dominant; 3,503) and 1,956 (95% UI: 1,010; 2,750) AUD/HALY over 10 years and 
lifetime, respectively. Findings were robust across several sensitivity 
analyses. Key limitations of the study include the lack of recent data of TFA 
intake and the small sample sizes used to estimate intakes in subgroups. As with 
all simulation models, our study does not prove that a ban of iTFA will prevent 
IHD, rather, it provides the best quantitative estimates and corresponding 
uncertainty of a potential effect in the absence of stronger direct evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model estimates that a ban of iTFAs could avert substantial 
numbers of IHD events and deaths in Australia and would likely be a highly 
cost-effective strategy to reduce social-economic and urban-rural inequalities 
in health. These findings suggest that elimination of iTFA can cost-effectively 
improve health and health equality even in countries with low iTFA intake.

PURPOSE: Geographic information systems (GIS) are widely used in public health 
research but rarely used in radiology research. GIS can be an impactful tool in 
radiology global health to locate medically underserved populations and poor 
transportation infrastructure, characterize medical needs, and design outreach 
programs. Using the example of aircraft-based outreach in Alaska, we demonstrate 
the utility of GIS in radiological program planning for global health.
METHODS: Multicriteria GIS evaluations were performed to create a health 
severity index, using life expectancy and percentage uninsured data, and an 
accessibility severity index, using distance from roads and health centers or 
hospitals. These indices were combined with population density to create a final 
health access severity index (HASI). A map presenting suitable hybrid airship 
operating areas was produced using land cover data. Alaskan health care 
facilities were georeferenced to create a coordinate data set. Infrastructure 
was obtained from OpenStreetMap. Health data were accessed from the 2017 
American Community Survey and CDC US Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates 
Project.
RESULTS: GIS analyzed 738,050 Alaskans. The health severity index identified 
decreased health outcomes (high or very high severity) in 285,446 (39%) 
Alaskans, and the accessibility severity index determined decreased access to 
care in 218,201 (30%). Combined, the HASI established 165,108 (22%) Alaskans as 
underserved with high or very high overall severity. Thirty-nine percent of 
Alaska land area is suitable for hybrid airship operations, including 27% of 
HASI high and very high severity areas.
CONCLUSIONS: GIS identified underserved populations for mobile radiology 
outreach in Alaska and may be useful for global health outreach planning and 
resource allocation.

Low-protein diets (LPDs) are the main treatment for urea cycle disorders (UCDs) 
and organic acidemias (OAs). In most cases, LPDs start in childhood and must be 
continued into adulthood. The improved life expectancy of patients with UCDs and 
OAs raises the question of their consequences on nutritional status in adult 
subjects. As this topic has so far received little attention, we conducted a 
review of scientific studies that investigated the nutrient intake and 
nutritional status in adult patients with UCDs and branched chain organic 
acidemias (BCOAs) on LPD.
METHODS: The literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE 
and Google Scholar from 1 January 2000 to 31 May 2020, focusing on nutrient 
intake and nutritional status in UCD and OA adult patients.
RESULTS: Despite protein restriction is recommended as the main treatment for 
UCDs and OAs, in these patients, protein intake ranges widely, with many 
patients who do not reach safety levels. When evaluated, micronutrient intake 
resulted below recommended values in some patients. Lean body mass resulted in 
most cases lower than normal range while fat body mass (FM) was often found 
normal or higher than the controls or reference values. Protein intake 
correlated inversely with FM both in adult and pediatric UCD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical management of adult patients with UCDs and BCOAs 
should include an accurate assessment of the nutritional status and body 
composition. However, as little data is still available on this topic, further 
studies are needed to better clarify the effects of LPDs on nutritional status 
in adult UCD and BCOA patients.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the impact of climate, socio-economic and 
demographic factors on the incidence of dengue in regions of the United States 
and Mexico. We select factors shown to predict dengue at a local level and test 
whether the association can be generalized to the regional or state level. In 
addition, we assess how different indicators perform compared to per capita 
gross domestic product (GDP), an indicator that is commonly used to predict the 
future distribution of dengue.
METHODS: A unique spatial-temporal dataset was created by collating information 
from a variety of data sources to perform empirical analyses at the regional 
level. Relevant regions for the analysis were selected based on their 
receptivity and vulnerability to dengue. A conceptual framework was elaborated 
to guide variable selection. The relationship between the incidence of dengue 
and the climate, socio-economic and demographic factors was modelled via a 
Generalized Additive Model (GAM), which also accounted for the spatial and 
temporal auto-correlation.
RESULTS: The socio-economic indicator (representing household income, education 
of the labour force, life expectancy at birth, and housing overcrowding), as 
well as more extensive access to broadband are associated with a drop in the 
incidence of dengue; by contrast, population growth and inter-regional migration 
are associated with higher incidence, after taking climate into account. An 
ageing population is also a predictor of higher incidence, but the relationship 
is concave and flattens at high rates. The rate of active physicians is 
associated with higher incidence, most likely because of more accurate 
reporting. If focusing on Mexico only, results remain broadly similar, however, 
workforce education was a better predictor of a drop in the incidence of dengue 
than household income.
CONCLUSIONS: Two lessons can be drawn from this study: first, while higher GDP 
is generally associated with a drop in the incidence of dengue, a more granular 
analysis reveals that the crucial factors are a rise in education (with fewer 
jobs in the primary sector) and better access to information or technological 
infrastructure. Secondly, factors that were shown to have an impact of dengue at 
the local level are also good predictors at the regional level. These indices 
may help us better understand factors responsible for the global distribution of 
dengue and also, given a warming climate, may help us to better predict 
vulnerable populations on a larger scale.
