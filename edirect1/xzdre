In this study, active biopolymer trays, being part of the biodegradable 
packaging, were developed and characterised. The aim of our research was to 
determine how active packaging (trays + films) affects the quality of salmon 
storage. The trays had high antioxidant potential and were biodegradable, 
however, they limited germination and seed growth, which may have been caused by 
the low pH of the material. Furthermore, the applied packaging demonstrated a 
potential possible inhibitory effect on the accumulation of biogenic amines and 
the growth of microorganisms responsible for the spoilage of salmon fillets. 
Compared to the control group, fillets stored in the tested pack had a 19% lower 
total bacteria count on the 6th day of storage. The innovative packing is easily 
biodegradable and prolongs the shelf-life of salmon fillets, therefore, it shows 
promise as a packaging material for perishable food products.

BACKGROUND: Providing a timely and accurate diagnosis of dementia and delivering 
appropriate support following a diagnosis are essential to allow individuals and 
their families to plan for the future. Recent studies suggest that provision of 
diagnosis and post-diagnosis support is suboptimal. This study explored 
geriatricians' views about strategies to improve quality of care across these 
domains.
METHODS: An anonymous online survey of geriatricians and advanced trainees in 
one Australian state was conducted. An Expert Advisory Group of geriatricians, 
behavioural scientists and consumers proposed strategies to improve quality of 
care in relation to diagnosis and post-diagnosis support for people with 
dementia, which formed the survey items. Potential strategies were guided by, 
but not limited to, dementia and chronic care guidelines. Participants were 
asked the extent to which they agreed that implementing each of the proposed 
strategies would improve the quality of dementia care.
RESULTS: Of 59 participants (response rate 42%), all agreed that improving 
accessibility of geriatricians would improve the accuracy and timeliness of 
diagnosis. Over 90% were supportive of strategies to improve capacity of general 
practitioners to accurately diagnose dementia. Between 97-100% agreed that 
information provided following diagnosis should encompass symptom progression, 
treatments, psychological supports, and advance care planning. Just over 
two-thirds thought that life expectancy should be discussed at this time. There 
were high levels of support for strategies already included in existing dementia 
care guidelines, however geriatricians also agreed with a range of possible 
strategies not currently included in guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatricians perceive that timeliness and accuracy of dementia 
diagnosis may be improved by increasing access to geriatricians and training 
general practitioners in diagnosing dementia. They also believe it is 
appropriate to provide information at the time of diagnosis across a 
comprehensive range of areas, including potentially sensitive topics such as 
advance care planning. Future studies should explore the views of other groups 
of health care providers and consumers about these approaches. The strategies 
proposed should be considered for inclusion in future dementia care guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal disorders (ND) are a significant global health issue. This 
article aimed to track the global trends of neonatal disorders in 204 
countries/territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data was explored from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019. 
Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and age-standardized rate (ASR) were 
calculated to quantify the trends of neonatal disorders and their specific 
causes, mainly included neonatal preterm birth (NPB), neonatal encephalopathy 
due to birth asphyxia and trauma (NE), neonatal sepsis and other neonatal 
infections (NS), and hemolytic disease and other neonatal jaundice (HD).
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 23,532.23 × 103 incident cases of ND, and caused 
1882.44 × 103 death worldwide. During 1990-2019, trends in the overall 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of ND was relatively stable, but that of 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR) declined (EAPC = -1.51, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: -1.66 to -1.36). Meanwhile, decreasing trends of ASDR were 
observed in most regions and countries, particularly Cook Islands and Estonia, 
in which the respective EAPCs were -9.04 (95%CI: -9.69 to -8.38) and -8.12 
(95%CI: -8.46 to -7.77). Among the specific four causes, only the NPB showed 
decreasing trends in the ASIR globally (EAPC = -0.19, 95%CI: -0.26 to -0.11). 
Decreasing trends of ASDR caused by ND underlying specific causes were observed 
in most regions, particularly the HD in Armenia, with the EAPC was -13.08 
(95%CI: -14.04 to -12.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing trends of death caused by neonatal disorders were 
observed worldwide from 1990 to 2019. However, the burden of neonatal disorders 
is still a considerable challenge, especially in low-resource settings, which 
need more effective health strategies.

The number of patients requiring heart valve surgery continues to increase with 
the growing life expectancy and expansion of both surgical and transcatheter 
valves. In patients with prosthetic heart valves (PHV), transthoracic 
echocardiography is the mainstay for initial assessment and serial surveillance. 
However, multimodality imaging, including three-dimensional transesophageal 
echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, 
fluoroscopy, and nuclear imaging, is becoming more commonly used clinically to 
aid in diagnosis and to identify the mechanism of PHV dysfunction. This review 
aims to provide an updated overview of the use of multimodality imaging in 
evaluation of PHVs, to illustrate the imaging appearance of different 
complications, and to highlight a practical approach to help clinical decision 
making in challenging cases of PHV dysfunction.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disorder in Caucasian 
populations, affecting roughly 70,000 individuals worldwide. This autosomal 
recessive disorder causes a wide spectrum of multisystemic manifestations, most 
of which are either directly or indirectly related to defective epithelial 
chloride secretion. The current median life expectancy is 44 years; however, a 
significant proportion of the CF population now live into the 5th decade and 
beyond due to advances in treatment. As life expectancy of CF patients 
increases, there is a newly emerging adult CF population with unique 
radiological manifestations spanning multiple organ systems, which often require 
follow-up imaging. The goal of this article is to review the multiple systemic 
manifestations and complications of CF on different imaging modalities and 
explore the appropriate radiological follow up recommended.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing research examining excess mortality in people 
with bipolar disorder using life expectancy and related measures, which quantify 
the disease impact on survival. However, there has been no meta-analysis to date 
summarising existing data on life expectancy in those with bipolar disorder.
AIMS: To systematically review and quantitatively synthesise estimates of life 
expectancy and years of potential life lost (YPLL) in people with bipolar 
disorder.
METHOD: We searched Embase, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases up to 
31 March 2021. We generated pooled life expectancy using random-effects models, 
and derived YPLL summary estimate by calculating averaged values weighted by 
sample size of individual studies. Subgroup analyses were conducted for gender, 
geographical region, study period, a given age (set-age) for lifespan estimation 
and causes of death. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021241705).
RESULTS: Eleven and 13 studies were included in the review for life expectancy 
(n = 96 601) and YPLL (n = 128 989), respectively. Pooled life expectancy was 
66.88 years (95% CI 64.47-69.28; I2 = 99.9%, P < 0.001), was higher in women 
than men (70.51 (95% CI 68.61-72.41) v. 64.59 (95% CI 61.16-68.03); z = 2.00, P 
= 0.003) and was lowest in Africa. Weighted average YPLL was 12.89 years (95% CI 
12.72-13.07), and was greatest in Africa. More YPLL was observed when lifespan 
was estimated at birth than at other set-age. YPLLs attributable to natural and 
unnatural deaths were 5.94 years (95% CI 5.81-6.07) and 5.69 years (95% CI 
5.59-5.79), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar disorder is associated with substantially shortened life 
expectancy. Implementation of multilevel, targeted interventions is urgently 
needed to reduce this mortality gap.

Research on quality adjusted life year (QALY) has been underway for just over 50 
years, which seems like a suitable milestone to review its history. The purpose 
of this study is to provide a historical overview of why the QALY was developed, 
the key theoretical work undertaken by Torrance, Bush and Fanshel and how two 
seminal papers shaped its subsequent development. Moving the QALY forward - 
there are several historical and reflective exercises. The historical interplay 
between politics, policy and the challenges facing the National Health Service 
(NHS) in formulating the QALY concept in the UK has been explored in some depth 
already, whilst the conceptualization and development of the methodological 
framework is relatively underexplored. We address this gap by viewing the QALY 
through the lens of the methodological debates, reflecting upon two key papers 
underpinning the QALY methodology and how these methods have been developed over 
time. In part the changes in technology e.g. Google Scholar, and the 
availability of tools to search for early uses of the QALY allow us to better 
understand the historical context in which the theoretical development of the 
QALY has taken place. Here we celebrate two seminal papers that shaped early 
QALY development. The first section provides a history of these papers, 
summaries their contributions and explores the uptake of these papers over time. 
The second section reviews the methodological debates that have surrounded the 
QALY over the last 50 years and looks at how the QALY has moved to address these 
challenges. The third section presents the voices of diverse commentators 
representing the field of health economics who have contributed to the 
subsequent development of the QALY in both theoretical and empirical capacities 
and captures their thoughts about future research and policy use of QALYS.

As a result of advances in healthcare, the worldwide average life expectancy is 
steadily increasing. However, this positive trend has societal and individual 
costs, not least because greater life expectancy is linked to higher incidence 
of age-related diseases, such as dementia. Over the past few decades, research 
has isolated various protective "healthy lifestyle" factors argued to contribute 
positively to cognitive aging, e.g., healthy diet, physical exercise and 
occupational attainment. The present article critically reviews neuroscientific 
evidence for another such factor, i.e., speaking multiple languages. Moreover, 
with multiple societal stakeholders in mind, we contextualize and stress the 
importance of the research program that seeks to uncover and understand 
potential connections between bilingual language experience and cognitive aging 
trajectories, inclusive of the socio-economic impact it can have. If on the 
right track, this is an important line of research because bilingualism has the 
potential to cross-over socio-economic divides to a degree other healthy 
lifestyle factors currently do not and likely cannot.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-induced weight gain is a contributing factor in the 
reduced life expectancy reported amongst people with psychotic disorders. CYP2D6 
is a liver enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used antipsychotic 
medications. We investigated if CYP2D6 genetic variation influenced weight or 
BMI among people taking antipsychotic treatment.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and a random effects meta-analysis of 
publications in Pubmed, Embase, PsychInfo, and CENTRAAL that had BMI and/or 
weight measurements of patients on long-term antipsychotics by their 
CYP2D6-defined metabolic groups (poor, intermediate, normal/extensive, and 
ultra-rapid metabolizers, UMs).
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the systematic review. All cohort 
studies suggested that the presence of reduced-function or non-functional 
alleles for CYP2D6 was associated with greater antipsychotic-induced weight 
gain, whereas most cross-sectional studies did not find any significant 
associations. Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis with clinical 
data of 2,041 patients, including 93 poor metabolizers (PMs), 633 intermediate 
metabolizers (IMs), 1,272 normal metabolizers (NMs), and 30 UMs. Overall, we did 
not find associations in any of the comparisons made. The estimated pooled 
standardized differences for the following comparisons were (i) PM versus NM; 
weight = -0.07 (95%CI: -0.49 to 0.35, p = 0.74), BMI = 0.40 (95%CI: -0.19 to 
0.99, p = 0.19). (ii) IM versus NM; weight = 0.09 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.22, p = 
0.16) and BMI = 0.09 (95% CI: -0.24 to 0.41, p = 0.60). (iii) UM versus EM; 
weight = 0.01 (95% CI: -0.37 to 0.40, p = 0.94) and BMI = -0.08 (95%CI: -0.57 to 
0.42, p = 0.77).
CONCLUSION: Our systematic review of cohort studies suggested that CYP2D6 poor 
metabolizers have higher BMI than normal metabolizers, but the data of 
cross-sectional studies and the meta-analysis did not show this association. 
Although our review and meta-analysis constitutes one of the largest studies 
with comprehensively genotyped samples, the literature is still limited by small 
numbers of participants with genetic variants resulting in poor or UMs status. 
We need further studies with larger numbers of extreme metabolizers to establish 
its clinical utility in antipsychotic treatment. CYP2D6 is a key gene for 
personalized prescribing in mental health.

BACKGROUND: Calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are a class of important 
calcium signal sensing response proteins, which play an important regulatory 
role in response to abiotic stress. However, researchers have not been excavated 
CDPKs' role in drought in sea-island cotton(Gossypium barbadense L. 'H7124').
RESULTS: Eighty-four CDPK genes have been identified in G. barbadense. These 
GbCDPK genes are unevenly distributed on 26 chromosomes, and segmental 
duplication is the significant way for the extension of CDPK family. Also, 
members within the same subfamily share a similar gene structure and motif 
composition. There are a large number of cis-elements involved in plant growth 
and response to stresses in the promoter regions of GbCDPKs. Additionally, these 
GbCDPKs show differential expression patterns in cotton tissues. The 
transcription levels of most genes were markedly altered in cotton under heat, 
cold, salt and PEG treatments, while the expressions of some GbCDPKs were 
induced in cotton under drought stress. Among these drought-induced genes, we 
selected GbCDPK32, GbCDPK68, GbCDPK74, GbCDPK80 and GbCDPK83 for further 
functional characterization by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the principal findings of this prospective study are 
that CDPKs were associated with drought. These findings provide a solid 
foundation for the development of future molecular mechanism in sea-island 
cotton.

Polarity, which refers to the molecular or structural asymmetry in cells, is 
essential for diverse cellular functions. Dictyostelium has proven to be a 
valuable system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cell polarity. 
Previous studies in Dictyostelium have revealed a range of signaling and 
cytoskeletal proteins that function at the leading edge to promote pseudopod 
extension and migration. In contrast, how proteins are localized to the trailing 
edge is not well understood. By screening for asymmetrically localized proteins, 
we identified a novel trailing-edge protein we named Teep1. We show that a 
charged surface formed by two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains in Teep1 is 
necessary and sufficient for targeting it to the rear of cells. Combining 
biochemical and imaging analyses, we demonstrate that Teep1 interacts 
preferentially with PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,5)P2 in vitro and simultaneous 
elimination of these lipid species in cells blocks the membrane association of 
Teep1. Furthermore, a leading-edge localized myotubularin phosphatase likely 
mediates the removal of PI(3,5)P2 from the front, as well as the formation of a 
back-to-front gradient of PI(3,5)P2. Together our data indicate that PI(4,5)P2 
and PI(3,5)P2 on the plasma membrane jointly participate in shaping the back 
state of Dictyostelium cells.

BACKGROUND: Many clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend exercise as an 
intervention for patients with sarcopenia. However, the significance of exercise 
on patient-important outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia is inconsistent 
when considering available minimal important differences. To synthesize current 
systematic review and meta-analyses evidence on the efficacy of exercise on 
patient-important outcomes in the treatment of sarcopenia in older adults.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (Cochrane database of 
systematic review, CDSR) via OvidSP and Web of science until April 2021 and 
reference lists. Two independent investigators performed abstracted and title 
screening, assessed the full text and quality of evidence. This umbrella review 
included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs). Eligible reviews aim to evaluate the effect of exercise on 
patient-important sarcopenic outcomes (muscle or physical function, mortality, 
and quality of life) in treating sarcopenia in older people. We used the 
minimally important differences (MIDs) of these outcomes to assess if the 
effects of exercise matter to patients.
RESULTS: This umbrella review provided a broad overview of the existing evidence 
and evaluated the systematic reviews' methodological quality and evidence for 
all these associations. In older patients with sarcopenia, moderate- to 
high-quality evidence showed that exercise intervention probably increases 
walking speed and improved physical performance (measured by TUG test); exercise 
may increase the muscle strength (grip strength, keen extension strength); but 
the effect size for grip strength probably too small to achieve patients 
important changes. Evidence for older people with sarcopenic obesity is limited, 
and we found the consistent effect of exercise interventions on grip strength 
and usual walking speed.
CONCLUSION: Exercise has a positive and important effect on physical performance 
for older adults with sarcopenia, which supports leaving the current 
recommendations unchanged. New systematic reviews to summarize the effect of 
exercise on the quality of life are warranted to fill the current evidence gap.

Background. Multi-criteria decision analysis can improve the legitimacy of 
health care reimbursement decisions by taking societal preferences into account 
when weighting decision criteria. This study measures the relative importance of 
health care coverage criteria according to the Belgian general public and policy 
makers. Criteria are structured into three domains: therapeutic need, societal 
need, and new treatments' added value. Methods. A sample of 4,288 citizens and 
161 policy makers performed a discrete choice experiment. Data were analyzed 
using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Level-independent criteria 
weights were determined using the log-likelihood method. Results. Both the 
general public and policy makers gave the highest weight to quality of life in 
the appraisal of therapeutic need (0.43 and 0.53, respectively). The general 
public judged life expectancy (0.14) as less important than inconvenience of 
current treatment (0.43), unlike decision makers (0.32 and 0.15). The general 
public gave more weight to "impact of a disease on public expenditures" (0.65) 
than to "prevalence of the disease" (0.56) when appraising societal need, 
whereas decision makers' weights were 0.44 and 0.56, respectively. When 
appraising added value, the general public gave similar weights to "impact on 
quality of life" and "impact on prevalence" (0.37 and 0.36), whereas decision 
makers judged "impact on quality of life" (0.39) more important than "impact on 
prevalence" (0.29). Both gave the lowest weight to impact on life expectancy 
(0.14 and 0.21). Limitations. Comparisons between the general public and policy 
makers should be treated with caution because the policy makers' sample size was 
small. Conclusion. Societal preferences can be measured and used as decision 
criteria weights in multi-criteria decision analysis. This cannot replace 
deliberation but can improve the transparency of health care coverage decision 
processes.

INTRODUCTION: Total population mortality rates have been falling and life 
expectancy increasing for more than 30 years. Diabetes remains a significant 
risk factor for premature death. Here we used the Oxford Royal College of 
General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RCGP RSC) practices to 
determine diabetes-related vs non-diabetes-related mortality rates.
METHODS: RCGP RSC data were provided on annual patient numbers and deaths, at 
practice level, for those with and without diabetes across four age groups 
(< 50, 50-64, 65-79, ≥ 80 years) over 15 years. Investment in diabetes control, 
as measured by the cost of primary care medication, was also taken from GP 
prescribing data.
RESULTS: We included 527 general practices. Over the period 2004-2019, there was 
no significant change in life years lost, which varied between 4.6 and 5.1 years 
over this period. The proportion of all diabetes deaths by age band was 
significantly higher in the 65-79 years age group for men and women with 
diabetes than for their non-diabetic counterparts. For the year 2019, 26.6% of 
deaths were of people with diabetes. Of this 26.6%, 18.5% would be expected from 
age group and non-diabetes status, while the other 8.1% would not have been 
expected-pro rata to nation, this approximates to approximately 40,000 excess 
deaths in people with diabetes vs the general population.
CONCLUSION: There remains a wide variation in mortality rate of people with 
diabetes between general practices in UK. The mortality rate and life years lost 
for people with diabetes vs non-diabetes individuals have remained stable in 
recent years, while mortality rates for the general population have fallen. 
Investment in diabetes management at a local and national level is enabling us 
to hold the ground regarding the life-shortening consequences of having diabetes 
as increasing numbers of people develop T2DM at a younger age.

BACKGROUND: Whether gastroparesis is associated with a shortened life expectancy 
remains uncertain as no systematic study has evaluated the impact of 
gastroparesis on mortality, based on gastric emptying (GE) tests.
AIM: This study aimed to assess whether delayed GE was predictive of mortality.
METHODS: GE was measured using a 13C-octanoic acid breath test in 1563 
consecutive patients. Delayed GE at baseline defined the gastroparesis group. 
Patients were followed up for a mean of 8.9 years, yielding 13 466 patients per 
year. Mortality was assessed using the French CepiDc database with data from 
local civil registries. The cause of death was determined from medical records. 
Mortality rates were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratio 
(HR) was calculated using the Cox regression model.
RESULTS: Age and symptoms severity were not different among patients with normal 
GE (n = 1179) and with delayed GE (n = 384) while diabetes mellitus was more 
frequent in the gastroparesis group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed increased 
mortality in the gastroparesis group compared to patients with normal GE. Cox 
regression model identified delayed GE as independently associated with 
increased mortality (HR = 1.63[1.09-2.42]; P = 0.02). Other independent factors 
associated with increased mortality included age, male sex, and diabetes. No 
difference was observed between groups for the cause of death, with cancer and 
cardiovascular disease being the leading causes.
CONCLUSION: This study has shown that gastroparesis, diagnosed on GE tests, was 
associated with increased mortality, independently of age, sex, BMI or diabetes 
status (NCT04918329).

This study examined the efficacy of the occupational health model of rational 
emotive behavioral on work-life balance (WLB) and burnout management (BOM) 
among public school teachers. The study was a pretest-posttest randomized 
control group design. The participants were 141 teachers in rural communities in 
Enugu state Nigeria drawn with emphasis on inclusion criteria. Two instruments 
were used for the data. Data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of 
variance. The result showed that rational emotive occupational health coaching 
(REOHC) led to a significant increase in the management of WLB and burnout among 
teachers compared to their counterparts in the control group. At the follow-up 
stage, REOHC proved to be effective over a period of 3 months. REOHC is a 
therapeutic intervention strategy that is valid and reliable over time in the 
management of WLB and BOM among teachers. The researchers are optimistic that 
the extension of REOHC to other related social and psychological-based 
self-defeating belief by social workers, psychologists, counselors, and 
employers of labors can enhance their productivity and emotionality in the home 
and workplace.

Causes of America's Lagging Life Expectancy: An International Comparative 
Perspective.

of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.

OBJECTIVES: This study assesses how American life expectancy compares to other 
high-income countries and identifies key age groups and causes of death 
responsible for the U.S. life expectancy shortfall.
METHODS: Data from the Human Mortality Database, World Health Organization 
Mortality Database, and vital statistics agencies for 18 high-income countries 
are used to examine trends in U.S. life expectancy gaps and how American 
age-specific death rates compare to other countries. Decomposition is used to 
estimate the contribution of 19 age groups and 16 causes to the U.S. life 
expectancy shortfall.
RESULTS: In 2018, life expectancy for American men and women was 5.18 and 5.82 
years lower than the world leaders and 3.60 and 3.48 years lower than the 
average of the comparison countries. Americans aged 25-29 experience death rates 
nearly 3 times higher than their counterparts. Together, injuries (drug 
overdose, firearm-related deaths, motor vehicle accidents, homicide), 
circulatory diseases, and mental disorders/nervous system diseases (including 
Alzheimer's disease) account for 86% and 67% of American men's and women's life 
expectancy shortfall, respectively.
DISCUSSION: American life expectancy has fallen far behind its peer countries. 
The U.S.'s worsening mortality at the prime adult ages and eroding old-age 
mortality advantage drive its deteriorating performance in international 
comparisons.

Increased life expectancy, focus on appearance, and readily available and 
accessible cosmetic procedures have served to drive an increase in the number of 
nonsurgical cosmetic procedures performed in the last 20 years. Demographic 
shifts in the United States, with increases in diverse populations that seek 
nonsurgical cosmetic procedures, have resulted in the need for a better 
understanding of cultural preferences as well as structural and biological 
differences in the skin of people of color (POC). Although many advances in the 
form of cosmeceuticals, cosmetics, and photoprotection have been made to address 
the aesthetic needs of and minimize complications in POC, nonsurgical cosmetic 
procedures are required to address common aesthetic concerns. Gaps remain in the 
education of dermatologists regarding the appropriate selection and execution of 
nonsurgical cosmetic procedures in POC. This educational initiative will 
facilitate a favorable outcome and optimal cosmetic results for POC.

BACKGROUND: Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest who have severe 
neurological or functional disability at discharge require high-intensity 
long-term support. However, few data describe the long-term survival and 
health-care utilization for these patients.
METHODS: We identified a cohort of cardiac arrest survivors ≥ 18 years of age, 
treated at a single center in Western Pennsylvania from January 2010 to December 
2019, with a modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 5 at hospital discharge. We recorded 
demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics, and neurological exam at hospital 
discharge. We characterized long term survival and mortality through December 
31, 2020 through National Death Index query. We described survival time overall 
and in subgroups using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using log-rank tests.We 
linked cases with administrative data to determine 30, 90 day, and one-year 
hospital readmission rate. For subjects unable to follow commands at discharge, 
we reviewed records from index hospitalization to the present to describe 
improvement in neurological status and return home.
RESULTS: We screened 2,687 patients of which 975 survived to discharge. We 
identified 190 subjects with mRS of 5 at hospital discharge who were sent to 
non-hospice settings. Of these, 43 (23%) did not follow commands at discharge. 
One-year mortality was 38% (n = 71) with a median survival time of 4.2 years 
(IQR 0.3-10.9). Duration of survival was shorter in older subjects but did not 
differ based on, sex, or ability to follow commands at hospital discharge. 
Within the first year of discharge, 58% (n = 111) of subjects had at least one 
hospitalization with a median length of stay of 8 days [IQR 3-19]. Of subjects 
who did not follow commands at hospital discharge, 5/43 (11%) followed commands 
and 9 (21%) were reportedly living at home on subsequent encounters.
CONCLUSIONS: Of survivors treated over a decade at our institution, 20% 
(n = 190) were discharged from the hospital with severe functional disability. 
One-year mortality was 38%, and hospital readmissions were frequent. Few 
patients discharged unable to follow commands regained the ability over the 
period of observation, but many did return to living at home. These data can 
help inform decision maker expectations for patient trajectory and life 
expectancy.
