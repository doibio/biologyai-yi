BACKGROUND: Immunochemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) is a standard front-line treatment for 
follicular lymphoma. The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab has shown 
high efficacy in relapsed or refractory and untreated follicular lymphoma. We 
aimed to evaluate the safety and activity of the combination of lenalidomide and 
R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) in previously untreated patients with high burden follicular 
lymphoma.
METHODS: This single-arm, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 16 
hospitals in France, all of which were Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) sites. 
Eligible patients were aged 18-70 years and had previously untreated 
CD20-positive follicular lymphoma of grade 1, 2, or 3a; at least one high tumour 
burden criterion according to Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires 
criteria; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 2 or 
less; and a minimum life expectancy of more than 3 months. Patients received 
induction therapy with six cycles of R2-CHOP every 3 weeks (one cycle involved 
standard R-CHOP on days 1-5, and 25 mg oral lenalidomide per day on days 1-14), 
followed by two rituximab infusions at 3-week intervals. The total treatment 
schedule was 24 weeks. Patients who achieved a complete or partial response to 
induction therapy received maintenance therapy consisting of one rituximab 
infusion every 8 weeks for 2 years. The primary outcome was the proportion of 
patients who achieved a complete response (complete response and complete 
response unconfirmed), according to International Workshop to Standardize 
Response Criteria, at the end of induction treatment. Safety was assessed in all 
patients who completed treatment. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01393756, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2010, and Jan 25, 2012, 80 patients were enrolled, and 
68 (85%) completed six cycles of R2-CHOP. At the end of the induction phase, 59 
patients achieved a complete response (74%, 95% CI 63-83). 55 patients achieved 
a complete response at 30 months from enrolment (69%, 57-78). The most frequent 
adverse event was grade 4 neutropenia in 52 (65%) patients. The most frequent 
non-haematological side-effects included grade 1-2 sensory neuropathy in 28 
(35%) patients and grade 1-2 transient rash in 27 (34%) patients. Four patients 
died during the study period; none of these deaths were judged to be related to 
treatment.
INTERPRETATIONS: Lenalidomide in combination with R-CHOP had an acceptable 
safety profile and showed anti-cancer activity in patients with previously 
untreated high burden follicular lymphoma. A future comparative study showing 
evidence of a survival advantage would be necessary for this combination to be 
proposed as a treatment for follicular lymphoma.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal failure (IF) is defined as "the reduction of gut 
function below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or 
water and electrolytes, such that intravenous supplementation is required to 
maintain health and/or growth". Functionally, it may be classified as type I 
acute intestinal failure (AIF), type II prolonged AIF and type III chronic 
intestinal failure (CIF) The ESPEN Workshop on IF was held in Bologna, Italy, on 
15-16 October 2017 and the aims of this document were to highlight the current 
state of the art and future directions for research in IF.
METHODS: This paper represents the opinion of experts in the field, based on 
current evidence. It is not a formal review, but encompasses the current 
evidence, with emphasis on epidemiology, classification, diagnosis and 
management.
RESULTS: IF is the rarest form of organ failure and can result from a variety of 
conditions that affect gastrointestinal anatomy and function adversely. 
Assessment, diagnosis, and short and long-term management involves a 
multidisciplinary team with diverse expertise in the field that aims to reduce 
complications, increase life expectancy and improve quality of life in patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Both AIF and CIF are relatively rare conditions and most of the 
published work presents evidence from small, single-centre studies. Much remains 
to be investigated to improve the diagnosis and management of IF and future 
studies should rely on multidisciplinary, multicentre and multinational 
collaborations that gather data from large cohorts of patients. Emphasis should 
also be placed on partnership with patients, carers and government agencies in 
order to improve the quality of research that focuses on patient-centred 
outcomes that will help to improve both outcomes and quality of life in patients 
with this devastating condition.

Patients with HER2-positive tumors often suffer resistance to therapy, 
warranting development of novel treatment modalities. Affibody molecules are 
small affinity proteins which can be engineered to bind to desired targets. They 
have in recent years been found to allow precise targeting of cancer specific 
molecular signatures such as the HER2 receptor. In this study, we have 
investigated the potential of an affibody molecule targeting HER2, ZHER2:2891, 
conjugated with the cytotoxic maytansine derivate MC-DM1, for targeted cancer 
therapy. ZHER2:2891 was expressed as a monomer (ZHER2:2891), dimer 
((ZHER2:2891)2) and dimer with an albumin binding domain (ABD) for half-life 
extension ((ZHER2:2891)2-ABD). All proteins had a unique C-terminal cysteine 
that could be used for efficient and site-specific conjugation with MC-DM1. The 
resulting affibody drug conjugates were potent cytotoxic molecules for human 
cells over-expressing HER2, with sub-nanomolar IC50-values similar to 
trastuzumab emtansine, and did not affect cells with low HER2 expression. A 
biodistribution study of a radiolabeled version of (ZHER2:2891)2-ABD-MC-DM1, 
showed that it was taken up by the tumor. The major site of off-target uptake 
was the kidneys and to some extent the liver. (ZHER2:2891)2-ABD-MC-DM1 was found 
to have a half-life in circulation of 14 h. The compound was tolerated well by 
mice at 8.5 mg/kg and was shown to extend survival of mice bearing HER2 
over-expressing tumors. The findings in this study show that affibody molecules 
are a promising class of engineered affinity proteins to specifically deliver 
small molecular drugs to cancer cells and that such conjugates are potential 
candidates for clinical evaluation on HER2-overexpressing cancers.

To investigate the relationship between the yield of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) 
and the flux variation in metabolic pathways of Klebsiella pneumoniae, an 
optimized calculation method was constructed on basis of dynamic flux balance 
analysis by combining genome-scale flux balance analysis with a kinetic model of 
extracellular metabolites. Through optimizing calculations, a more completely 
expanded metabolic pathway was obtained, which includes the previously reported 
metabolic pathway and additional three pathways or site: a pentose phosphate 
pathway (PPP) elicited at the dihydroxyacetone (DHA) node to provide more 
reducing equivalents; a branch of synthetic amino acids at the 
3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) node; and the α-ketoglutarate site in the tricarboxylic 
acid (TCA) cycle leading to anabolic pathways for glutamate and other amino 
acids. On this basis, the relationships between the dynamic flux distribution of 
the important nodes in the metabolic pathway and the yield of 1,3-propanediol 
were analyzed. First, dynamic flux change from DHA to the PPP is positively 
correlated with the yield. Second, variation in flux in the TCA cycle is also 
positively correlated with the yield of 1,3-propanediol. In addition, the 
influence of the feedback loop formed by the cofactor tetrahydrofolate on the 
flux change of TCA in the amino acid anabolic pathway was examined. These 
results are of important reference value and have guiding significance for the 
extension of the glycerol metabolism pathway in K. pneumoniae, the rational 
transformation of genetic engineering in bacteria, and the optimization of 
metabolic pathways for industrial production.

PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
reconstruction with meniscal repair to ACL reconstruction with partial 
meniscectomy.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov disease progression model with a 40-year 
horizon was created simulating outcomes after both meniscal repair and partial 
meniscectomy at the time of ACL reconstruction. Event probabilities, costs, and 
utilities were used for the index procedures. The development of osteoarthritis 
and subsequent knee replacement were either calculated or selected from 
published literature. Difference in cost, difference in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effective ratio were calculated to 
determine which index procedure is most cost-effective.
RESULTS: There is total direct cost from ACL reconstruction with meniscus repair 
of $17,898 compared with that with partial meniscectomy of $24,768 (cost savings 
of $6,870). There was an estimated gain of 18.00 QALYs after ACL reconstruction 
with meniscus repair compared with 17.16 QALYs with partial meniscectomy 
(increase of 0.84 QALYs). In this scenario, meniscus repair is the dominant 
index procedure at the time of ACL reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: Meniscal repair at the time of ACL reconstruction is more 
cost-effective than partial meniscectomy.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, economic and decision analysis.

BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, social and economic changes have had 
substantial effects on health and wellbeing in Russia. We aimed to use data from 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) 
to evaluate trends in mortality, causes of death, years lived with disability 
(YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and 
associated risk factors in Russia from 1980 to 2016.
METHODS: We estimated all-cause mortality by use of a multistage modelling 
process that synthesised data from vital registration systems, surveys, and 
censuses. A composite measure of health loss due to both fatal and non-fatal 
disease burden (DALYs) was calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs for each age, 
sex, year, and location. Health progress was evaluated in comparison with 
patterns of change in similar countries by use of the Socio-demographic Index 
that was developed for GBD 2016.
FINDINGS: Following rapid decreases in life expectancy after the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, life expectancy at birth in Russia improved between 2006 and 2016. 
The all-cause mortality rate decreased by 16·6% (95% uncertainty interval 
9·4-33·8) between 1980 and 2016. This overall decrease encompasses the cycles of 
sharp increases and plateaus in mortality that occurred before 2005. Child 
mortality decreased by 57·5% (53·5-61·1) between 2000 and 2016. However, 
compared with countries at similar Socio-demographic Index levels, rates of 
mortality and disability in Russia remain high and life expectancy is low. 
Russian men have a disproportionate burden of disease relative to women. In 
2016, 59·2% (55·3-62·6) of mortality in men aged 15-49 years and 46·8% 
(44·5-49·5) of mortality in women were attributable to behavioural risk factors, 
including alcohol use, drug use, and smoking.
INTERPRETATION: Trends in mortality in Russia from 1980 to 2016 might be related 
to complicated patterns of behavioural risk factors associated with economic and 
social change, to shifts in disease burden, and to changes in the capacity of 
and access to health care. Ongoing mortality and disability from causes and 
risks amenable to health-care interventions and behaviour modifications present 
opportunities to continue to improve the wellbeing of Russian citizens.

OBJECTIVES: Management of otogenic cerebral venous thrombosis (OCVT) is 
controversial. Despite the modern antibiotic era OCVT still represents a 
potential life-threatening condition. This study aims to report the clinical 
presentation and management in a series of children with OCTV. The coexisting 
intracranial complications (ICC), the extent of the surgical treatment and the 
role of hypocoagulation were the analysed outcomes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients aged less than 16 
years and consecutively treated for OCVT at a tertiary university hospital 
between January 2007 and March 2015.
RESULTS: Sixteen children with ages ranging between 25 months and 16 years (9 
girls/7 boys) with OCVT were identified. Acute otitis media was the causative 
factor in the majority of cases (n = 13). The remaining cases resulted from 
chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (COMC). Eleven patients were under 
antibiotic therapy prior to admission. Other ICC were simultaneously present: 
intracranial abscess (n = 6); otitic hydrocephalus (n = 3); and meningitis 
(n = 1). Thrombus extension correlated with the presence of additional ICC 
(p = 0.035). Treatment in all cases comprised of broad-spectrum antibiotics, 
mastoidectomy, and long-range hypocoagulation with warfarin. Transtympanic 
ventilation tubes were inserted in all cases but one with COMC. Perioperative 
sigmoid sinus exposure was performed in seven patients, with drainage of 
perisinus empyema in three cases. Five children underwent simultaneous 
craniotomy for intracranial abscess drainage. Follow-up imaging performed in 12 
cases revealed partial or complete recanalization in three and seven cases, 
respectively. After a mean hypocoagulation duration of nine months, no 
hemorrhagic or major neurologic complications were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of OCVT can be masked by previous antibiotic 
therapy. As such, a high suspicion index is needed for diagnosis. Simultaneous 
ICC appears to be more frequently found if an extensive thrombosis was present. 
The high recanalization rate in this series with low morbidity and no mortality 
can be obtained with a timely combination of antibiotics, mastoidectomy with 
transtympanic tube insertion and hypocoagulation. However, the decision to start 
hypocoagulation and its duration should be undertaken on an individual basis 
owing the possible adverse effects. Prospective and case-control studies are 
still needed to better clarify the role of the hypocoagulation treatment in 
OCVT.

BACKGROUND: Existing models for forecasting future care needs are limited in the 
risk factors included and in the assumptions made about incoming cohorts. We 
estimated the numbers of people aged 65 years or older in England and the years 
lived in older age requiring care at different intensities between 2015 and 2035 
from the Population Ageing and Care Simulation (PACSim) model.
METHODS: PACSim, a dynamic microsimulation model, combined three studies 
(Understanding Society, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and the 
Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II) to simulate individuals' 
sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, 12 chronic diseases and geriatric 
conditions, and dependency (categorised as high [24-h care], medium [daily 
care], or low [less than daily] dependency; or independent). Transition 
probabilities for each characteristic were estimated by modelling state changes 
from baseline to 2-year follow-up. Years in dependency states were calculated by 
Sullivan's method.
FINDINGS: Between 2015 and 2035 in England, both the prevalence of and numbers 
of people with dependency will fall for young-old adults (65-74 years). For very 
old adults (≥85 years), numbers with low dependency will increase by 148·0% 
(range from ten simulations 140·0-152·0) and with high dependency will almost 
double (increase of 91·8%, range 87·3-94·1) although prevalence will change 
little. Older adults with medium or high dependency and dementia will be more 
likely to have at least two other concurrent conditions (increasing from 58·8% 
in 2015 to 81·2% in 2035). Men aged 65 years will see a compression of 
dependency with 4·2 years (range 3·9-4·2) of independence gained compared with 
life expectancy gains of 3·5 years (3·1-4·1). Women aged 65 years will 
experience an expansion of mainly low dependency, with 3·0 years (3·0-3·6) 
gained in life expectancy compared with 1·4 years (1·2-1·4) with low dependency 
and 0·7 years (0·6-0·8) with high dependency.
INTERPRETATION: In the next 20 years, the English population aged 65 years or 
over will see increases in the number of individuals who are independent but 
also in those with complex care needs. This increase is due to more individuals 
reaching 85 years or older who have higher levels of dependency, dementia, and 
comorbidity. Health and social care services must adapt to the complex care 
needs of an increasing older population.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of an 
integrated system of stroke care on symptom to surgery times, 
cost-effectiveness, and quality of life measures in patients with symptomatic 
carotid stenosis.
METHODS: Patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a regional 
vascular centre between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2016, were identified from 
the National Vascular Registry (NVR). Risk of stroke on medical therapy for each 
patient was calculated using the Oxford stroke risk calculator. Symptom to 
surgery times were compared among patients referred from a stroke service 
providing an integrated stroke care and the stroke service in an adjacent NHS 
trust which provides standard urgent referral pathway. A decision analytic 
Markov process model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CEA 
versus medical treatment in patients who followed the standard and integrated 
pathways. This model examined the lifetime costs and health benefits of CEA 
through each pathway.
RESULTS: A total of 376 patients underwent CEA, of whom 243 were managed through 
the integrated stroke pathway and 133 through the standard urgent referral 
pathway. Median symptom to surgery time was 11 (0-66) days for the former and 15 
(3-90) days for the latter (p < .001). There was no significant difference in 
peri-operative stroke death rate between integrated (2.1%) and standard (1.5%) 
pathways (chi-square = 0.14, p = .73). CEA through the integrated pathway 
improved quality adjusted life expectancy by an additional 0.13 (0.64 QALYs 
[integrated pathway] to 0.51 QALYs [standard pathway]) and was associated with 
an incremental lifetime cost benefit of £2203.4.
CONCLUSIONS: An integrated stroke system of care is cost-effective and 
associated with significant improvements in quality adjusted life years.

The study aims to explore the main drivers influencing the economic appraisal of 
heat warning systems by integrating epidemiological modelling and benefit-cost 
analysis. To shed insights on heat wave mortality valuation, we consider three 
valuation schemes: (i) a traditional one, where the value of a statistical life 
(VSL) is applied to both displaced and premature mortality; (ii) an intermediate 
one, with VSL applied for premature mortality and value of a life year (VOLY) 
for displaced mortality; and (iii) a conservative one, where both premature and 
displaced mortality are quantified in terms of loss of life expectancy, and then 
valued using the VOLY approach. When applying these three schemes to Madrid 
(Spain), we obtain a benefit-cost ratio varying from 12 to 3700. We find that 
the choice of the valuation scheme has the largest influence, whereas other 
parameters such as attributable risk, displaced mortality ratio, or the 
comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the heat warning system are less 
influential. The results raise the question of which is the most appropriate 
approach to value mortality in the context of heat waves, given that the lower 
bound estimate for the benefit-cost ratio (option iii using VOLY) is up to two 
orders of magnitude lower than the value based on the traditional VSL approach 
(option i). The choice of the valuation methodology has significant implications 
for public health authorities at the local and regional scale, which becomes 
highly relevant for locations where the application of the VOLY approach could 
lead to benefit-cost ratios significantly lower than 1. We propose that specific 
metrics for premature and displaced VOLYs should be developed for the context of 
heat waves. Until such values are available, we suggest testing the economic 
viability of heat warning systems under the three proposed valuation schemes 
(i-iii) and using values for VOLY commonly applied in air pollution as the 
health end points are similar. Lastly, periodical reassessment of heat alert 
plans should be performed by public health authorities to monitor their 
long-term viability and cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA) of 
mediastinal lymph nodes is a minimally invasive and efficient tool for both 
diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. EBUS-FNA also permits tumor genotyping. 
However this critical datum for the therapeutic management is often long to 
obtain for metastatic patients with short life expectancy.
METHODS: From May 2011 to December 2017, 398 lung cancer patients underwent a 
genetic analysis based on EBUS-FNA samples. EBUS-FNAs were performed with rapid 
on-site evaluation. Mutations were studied with Sanger or new generation 
sequencing. Forty-three cases were also tested with a fully automated real-time 
PCR rapid technique. ALK abnormalities were assessed by immunohistochemistry 
and/or in situ hybridization.
RESULTS: A genotypic result could be obtained in 316 cases (79.4%) and in 180 of 
the 198 more recent cases (90.9%). Genetic abnormalities were observed in 191 
cases (48.0%). Using the rapid technique, EGFR/KRAS mutational status was 
obtained within a few hours following the histological diagnosis and on the same 
day of the EBUS-FNA by analyzing fresh specimens after intra-operative 
cytological diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In term of molecular diagnosis, EBUS-FNA provides high-quality 
biological material similar to that of other clinical sampling methods. 
Furthermore, our study suggests that a rapid molecular diagnostic method could 
lead to a prompt and appropriate therapeutic management for many advanced stage 
patients.

Account for These Statistically.

For farmed species, good health and welfare is a win-win situation: both the 
animals and producers can benefit. In recent years, animal welfare scientists 
have embraced cognitive sciences to rise to the challenge of determining an 
animal's internal state in order to better understand its welfare needs and by 
extension, the needs of larger groups of animals. A wide range of cognitive 
tests have been developed that can be applied in farmed species to assess a 
range of cognitive traits. However, this has also presented challenges. Whilst 
it may be expected to see cognitive variation at the species level, differences 
in cognitive ability between and within individuals of the same species have 
frequently been noted but left largely unexplained. Not accounting for 
individual variation may result in misleading conclusions when the results are 
applied both at an individual level and at higher levels of scale. This has 
implications both for our fundamental understanding of an individual's welfare 
needs, but also more broadly for experimental design and the justification for 
sample sizes in studies using animals. We urgently need to address this issue. 
In this review, we will consider the latest developments on the causes of 
individual variation in cognitive outcomes, such as the choice of cognitive 
test, sex, breed, age, early life environment, rearing conditions, personality, 
diet, and the animal's microbiome. We discuss the impact of each of these 
factors specifically in relation to recent work in farmed species, and explore 
the future directions for cognitive research in this field, particularly in 
relation to experimental design and analytical techniques that allow individual 
variation to be accounted for appropriately.

PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer refers to breast cancer that does not 
express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). This study aimed to identify the key pathways 
and genes and find the potential initiation and progression mechanism of 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
METHODS: We downloaded the gene expression profiles of GSE76275 from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. This microarray Super-Series sets are 
composed of gene expression data from 265 samples which included 67 non-TNBC and 
198 TNBC. Next, all the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with p<0.01 and 
fold change ≥1.5 or ≤-1.5 were identified.
RESULT: 56 upregulated and 151 downregulated genes were listed and the gene 
ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) 
enrichment analysis was performed. These significantly changed genes were mainly 
involved in the biological process termed prostate gland morphogenesis, inner 
ear morphogenesis, cell maturation, digestive tract morphogenesis, autonomic 
nervous system development, monovalent inorganic anion homeostasis, neural crest 
cell development, regulation of dendrite extension and glial cell proliferation, 
immune system process termed T cell differentiation, regulation of immune 
response, and macrophage activation. Genes are mainly involved in the KEGG 
pathway termed Oocyte meiosis. All DEGs underwent survival analysis using 
datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) integrated by cBioPortal, of which 
amplification of SRY-related HMG-box 8 (SOX8), androgen receptor (AR), and 
Chromosome 9 Open Reading Frame 152 (C9orf152) were significantly negative while 
Nik Related Kinase (NRK) and RAS oncogene family 30 (RAB30) were positively 
correlated to the life expectancy (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these pathways and genes identified could help 
understanding the mechanism of development of TNBC. Besides, SOX8, AR, C9orf152, 
NRK and RAB30, and other key genes and pathways might be promising targets for 
the TNBC treatment.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 
low-intensity resistance training with slow movement and tonic force generation 
(LST) on muscular function and glucose metabolism in older patients with type 2 
diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 
68.2 ± 9.7 years) engaged in LST training twice a week for 16 weeks. Before the 
long-term intervention, they were subjected to the measurement of acute changes 
in blood factors relating to glycemic control as a result of a bout of LST. Body 
composition, muscular size and strength, and glycated hemoglobin were measured 
before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: The magnitudes of the acute changes in the blood factors were all small 
and were not considered harmful for glucose metabolism. The 16-week LST training 
caused significant increases in thigh muscle thickness and strength, and 
decreases in body fat mass and glycated hemoglobin. The change in glycated 
hemoglobin showed a significant negative correlation with the change in the 
isokinetic knee extension peak torque measured at a high angular velocity 
(180°/s).
CONCLUSIONS: The LST training was shown to be effective for gaining muscular 
size and strength, and improving glycemic control in older patients with type 2 
diabetes. The mechanisms underlying this effect might involve the improvement of 
contractile function in fast glycolytic fibers.

The prevalence of degenerative retinal disease is ever increasing as life 
expectancy rises globally. The human retina fails to regenerate and the use of 
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells 
(hiPSCs) to engineer retinal tissue is of particular interest due to the limited 
availability of suitable allogeneic or autologous tissue. Retinal tissue and its 
development are well characterized, which have resulted in robust assays to 
assess the development of tissue-engineered retina. Retinal tissue can be 
generated in vitro from hESCs and hiPSCs without biomaterial scaffolds, but 
despite advancements, protocols remain slow, expensive, and fail to result in 
mature functional tissue. Several recent studies have demonstrated the potential 
of biomaterial scaffolds to enhance generation of hESC/hiPSC-derived retinal 
tissue, including synthetic polymers, silk, alginate, hyaluronic acid, and 
extracellular matrix molecules. This review outlines the advances that have been 
made toward tissue-engineered neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
for clinical application in recent years, including the success of clinical 
trials involving transplantation of cells and tissue to promote retinal repair; 
and the evidence from in vitro and animal studies that biomaterials can enhance 
development and integration of retinal tissue.

BACKGROUND: One of the fastest growing populations living with HIV is older 
adults especially those 65 years of age or older. Current antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) has prolonged life expectancy of persons with HIV. However, for therapy to 
be effective, patients need to be adherent. Over time, older persons with HIV 
may experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders or other factors that 
could affect ART adherence. The use of expedient cognitive tests that help 
measure medication adherence may be useful for the optimal care of these 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between cognitive tests and ART 
adherence.
METHODS: This was a prospective study evaluating patients 65 years of age or 
older with HIV. Cognitive tests used included the Executive Clock-Drawing Task 
(CLOX) 1 and 2, Trail Making Test parts A and B, and Grooved Pegboard Test 
(GPB). The medication event monitoring system cap over 1 month was used as the 
primary measure for adherence.
RESULTS: CLOX 1 and GPB were significantly related to adherence ( P < 0.05). 
Comparison of the magnitude of each measure's relation to adherence suggests 
that the GPB is a better indicator of ability to adhere ( R = 0.514 vs R = 
0.381). Conclusion and Relevance: CLOX 1 and GPB demonstrated an association 
with adherence in patients 65 years of age or older with HIV. Although the use 
of these tests to measure adherence in older persons with HIV seems promising, 
more research is needed to ascertain their ultimate utility.

Changes in working life expectancy with disability in the Netherlands, 
1992-2016.

Objectives Like other western countries, the Netherlands has abolished early 
retirement schemes and is currently increasing the statutory retirement age. It 
is likely that also older workers with disabilities will be required to work 
longer. We examine the change in working life expectancy (WLE) with disability 
of older workers by comparing data from three periods: 1992-1996, 2002-2006 and 
2012-2016. Methods Data are from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). 
Respondents aged 55-65 with a paid job at baseline were included (N=1074). 
Disability was measured using the Global Activity Limitations Indicator (GALI). 
First, a continuous-time three-state survival model was created. Second, WLE 
with and without disability were estimated using MSM and ELECT in R. The 
modifying effects of gender and educational level were examined. Results Among 
those initially in paid employment, total WLE increased over 20 years. For 
example at age 58, total WLE increased from 3.7 to 5.5 years. WLE with 
disability at age 58 increased from 0.8 to 1.5 years. There was no difference in 
WLE with disability between male and female workers or low- and highly educated 
workers. Conclusions Between the 1990s and the 2010s, subsequent generations of 
older workers with disabilities have extended their working lives. The findings 
emphasize the importance of workplace interventions that facilitate older 
workers with disabilities to maintain well-being and work ability. In addition, 
the question arises whether current exit routes out of the workforce are still 
adequate.

Wildlife on sandy beaches is often constrained by transformation of natural 
areas for human use, and opportunities for acquiring or restoring new habitat 
are rare. Storms can often force changes in land use naturally by re-shaping 
coastal landforms, thereby creating high quality habitat; yet, wildlife 
requirements are seldom considered in post-storm recovery planning, and 
conservation practitioners lack suitable evidence to argue for the protection of 
habitats freshly formed by storms. Here we used a maximum-likelihood spatial 
modeling approach to quantify impacts of Hurricane Sandy (mid-Atlantic United 
States, October 2012) on nesting habitat of four bird species of conservation 
concern: American oystercatchers, black skimmers, least terns and piping 
plovers. We calculated the immediate storm-created changes (loss, persisting, 
gained) in nesting habitat under two levels of conservation protections: the 
current regulatory framework, and a scenario in which all potential habitats 
were under conservation protection. Hurricane Sandy resulted in apparent large 
gains for least terns (+181 ha) and piping plovers (+289 ha). However, actual 
gains were reduced to 16 ha for plovers and reversed for least terns (net loss 
of 6.4 ha) because newly formed habitat occurred outside existing reserve 
boundaries. Similarly, under the current management framework, black skimmer 
nesting habitat decreased by ~164 ha. We also tested whether birds benefited 
from newly created nesting habitat by identifying nest and colony locations for 
three years following Hurricane Sandy. All species overwhelmingly nested in 
habitat that existed prior the storm (76-98% of all nests/colonies); only a 
small percentage (≤17% for all species) occupied newly created habitat. We 
conclude that static spatial conservation efforts fail to capitalize on 
potentially large gains resulting from storms for several species and recommend 
flexible spatial conservation investments as a key input in post-storm recovery 
planning.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy presents health systems with a 
growing challenge in the form of elderly obesity. Bariatric surgery has been 
shown to be a safe and effective treatment for obesity with reduction of excess 
weight and improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities. However, only recently 
have surgeons begun performing these operations on elderly patients on a larger 
scale, making data regarding mid- and long-term outcomes scarce. The objective 
of this study was to evaluate the safety and midterm efficacy of laparoscopic 
sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients aged ≥60 years.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥60 years who underwent LSG between 2008 and 2014 and 
achieved ≥24-month follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic 
characteristics and perioperative data were analyzed. Weight loss parameters and 
co-morbidity resolution rates were compared with preoperative data.
RESULTS: In total 55 patients aged ≥60 years underwent LSG. Mean patient age was 
63.9 ± 3.2 years (range, 60-75.2), and mean preoperative body mass index was 43 
± 6.0 kg/m2. Perioperative morbidity included 5 cases of hemorrhage 
necessitating operative exploration, 2 cases of reduced hemoglobin levels 
treated with blood transfusion, and 1 case of portal vein thrombosis managed 
with anticoagulation. There were no mortalities. Mean follow-up time was 48.6 
(range, 25.6-94.5) months. Mean percentage of excess weight loss was 66.4 ± 
19.7, 67.5 ±1 6.4, 61.4 ± 18.3, 66.7 ± 25.6, 50.7 ± 21.4 at 12, 24, 36, 37 to 
60, and 61 to 96 months, respectively. Statistically significant improvement of 
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were observed at the latest 
follow-up (P < .01).
CONCLUSION: LSG offers an effective treatment of obesity and its co-morbidities 
in patients aged ≥60 years, albeit with a high perioperative bleeding rate at 
our center; efficacy is maintained for at least 4.5 years.
