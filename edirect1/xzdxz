of tooth structures. The population was sedentary, agricultural type and the 
life expectancy was normal for the Late Iron Age. Besides, their socio-economic 
status was good. The age at the time of their death was between 30 and 40 years. 
Further studies should include more accurate and standardized methods for 
assessing the condition.

Lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration can induce bone hyperplasia, lumbar 
intervertebral disc herniation and other diseases, is one of the causes of low 
back pain, which seriously affects people's quality of life. And the causes of 
degeneration are very complex, so it is essential to understand the underlying 
mechanism of intervertebral disc degeneration and its influence. In this study, 
biomechanical effects of L4∼L5 lumbar degeneration with different degrees of 
degeneration were studied based on the numerical simulations. The 
three-dimensional finite element model of normal L2∼S1 lumbar vertebrae was 
established based on CT images of average adult male and verified. Several key 
parameters (intervertebral disc height, nucleus pulposus size, properties of 
different materials, etc.) of the model were modified to construct L4∼L5 models 
with different degrees of degeneration (grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4). 
The range of motion (ROM), the intradiscal pressure of the nucleus, and the 
maximum Von Mises stress were determined by applying torques in different 
directions to simulate the four postures of flexion, extension, lateral bending, 
and axial rotation under compression load (500 N) to simulate the upper body 
weight of the human body. In different postures, with the increase of L4∼L5 
degeneration degree, the ROM of the L4∼L5 degeneration segment showed a 
decreasing trend (Grade 4 had decrease of 41.9% to 65.2% compared to normal at 
different postures), while the ROM of its adjacent normal segments showed an 
increasing trend (L3∼L4: Grade 4 had increase of 21%-94% compared to normal at 
different postures; L5∼S1: Grade 4 had increase of 32%-66% compared to normal at 
different postures). With the increase in the degree of degeneration, nucleus 
pulposus pressure in the L4∼L5 degeneration segment decreased continuously under 
different postural conditions (Grade 4 had decrease of 25%-134.6% compared to 
normal at different postures), while the nucleus pulposus pressure in adjacent 
normal segments (L3∼L4 and L5∼S1) showed a gradually increasing trend. The 
maximum Von Mises stress of the three segments increased with the increasing 
degree of degeneration at different postures (L4∼L5: Grade 4 increased to 
1.75 ∼ 4 times compared to normal at different postures). In four different 
models of lumbar disc degeneration, the adjacent normal segment of the disc 
compensates for the movement and loading pattern of the degenerated segment. At 
the same time, the load pattern inside the degenerated segment also changes.

Mitral stenosis results from haemodynamic obstruction at the mitral valve level 
because of structural abnormalities of the valve apparatus, leading to increased 
resistance to the transmitral flow. Although rheumatic fever remains the 
predominant cause of mitral stenosis worldwide, other causes are increasingly 
relevant in the developed countries with degenerative mitral stenosis (DMS) 
because of mitral annulus calcification (MAC) becoming growingly prevalent in 
industrialized countries with higher life expectancy. Rheumatic mitral stenosis 
(RMS) and DMS display dramatic differences in pathophysiology, prognosis, and 
disease progression. Furthermore, to date, robust evidence regarding the 
management of DMS because of MAC is lacking. Nevertheless, new diagnostic 
techniques and catheter-based interventions are changing this landscape and 
paving the way to a significant reduction in DMS-related morbidity and 
mortality. Here we briefly review the current knowledge on the pathophysiology, 
diagnosis and treatment of DMS and RMS, underscoring the current diagnostic and 
therapeutic pathways, as well as persisting uncertainties and perspectives.

Cymbidium is an orchid genus that has undergone rapid radiation and has high 
ornamental, economic, ecological and cultural importance, but its classification 
based on morphology is controversial. The plastid genome (plastome), as an 
extension of plant standard DNA barcodes, has been widely used as a potential 
molecular marker for identifying recently diverged species or complicated plant 
groups. In this study, we newly generated 237 plastomes of 50 species (at least 
two individuals per species) by genome skimming, covering 71.4% of members of 
the genus Cymbidium. Sequence-based analyses (barcoding gaps and automatic 
barcode gap discovery) and tree-based analyses (maximum likelihood, Bayesian 
inference and multirate Poisson tree processes model) were conducted for species 
identification of Cymbidium. Our work provides a comprehensive DNA barcode 
reference library for Cymbidium species identification. The results show that 
compared with standard DNA barcodes (rbcL + matK) as well as the plastid 
trnH-psbA, the species identification rate of the plastome increased moderately 
from 58% to 68%. At the same time, we propose an optimized identification 
strategy for Cymbidium species. The plastome cannot completely resolve the 
species identification of Cymbidium, the main reasons being incomplete lineage 
sorting, artificial cultivation, natural hybridization and chloroplast capture. 
To further explore the potential use of nuclear data in identifying species, the 
Skmer method was adopted and the identification rate increased to 72%. It 
appears that nuclear genome data have a vital role in species identification and 
are expected to be used as next-generation nuclear barcodes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: While combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has 
dramatically increased the life expectancy of people with HIV (PWH), nearly 50% 
develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. This may be due to previously 
uncontrolled HIV viral replication, immune activation maintained by residual 
viral replication or activation from other sources, or cART-associated 
neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cART on 
cognition and neuroimaging biomarkers in PWH before and after initiation of cART 
compared with that in HIV-negative controls (HCs) and HIV elite controllers 
(ECs) who remain untreated.
METHODS: We recruited 3 groups of participants from the University of Rochester, 
McGovern Medical School, and SUNY Upstate Medical University: (1) ART 
treatment-naive PWH; (2) age-matched HCs; and (3) ECs. Participants underwent 
brain MRI and clinical and neuropsychological assessments at baseline, 1 year, 
and 2 years. PWH were also assessed 12 weeks after initiating cART. Volumetric 
analysis and fractal dimensionality (FD) were calculated for cortical and 
subcortical regions. Mixed effect regressions examined the effect of group and 
imaging variables on cognition.
RESULTS: We enrolled 47 PWH, 58 HCs, and 10 ECs. At baseline, PWH had worse 
cognition and lower cortical volumes than HCs. Cognition improved after 
initiation of cART and remained stable over time. Greater cortical thickness was 
associated with better cognition at baseline; greater FD of parietal, temporal, 
and occipital lobes was associated with better cognition at baseline and 
longitudinally. At baseline, ECs had worse cognition, lower cortical thickness, 
and lower FD in all 4 lobes and caudate than PWH and HCs. Greater cortical 
thickness, hippocampal volumes, and FD of frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes 
were associated with better cognition longitudinally.
DISCUSSION: Initiation of cART in PWH is associated with improvement in brain 
structure and cognition. However, significant differences persist over time when 
compared with HCs. Similar trends in ECs suggest that results are due to HIV 
infection rather than treatment. Stronger associations between cognition and FD 
suggest this imaging metric may be a more sensitive marker of neuronal injury 
than cortical thickness and volumetric measures.

INTRODUCTION: Demographic change in Germany is accompanied by a birth rate 
deficit and increasing life expectancy. One effect of the ageing population is 
an increase in people needing care, most of whom want to grow old in their homes 
and to be cared for there. At the same time, informal caregivers are a core 
resource in the German care system, but due to social changes, this resource is 
not endless. Processes of social change in German society will cause further 
erosion in the potential number of informal local caregivers. Therefore, it will 
be increasingly important to provide conditions so that individuals at a 
distance who support people needing care are actually able to do so. Distance 
caregiving is a broad field, posing questions of intergenerational and 
intragenerational solidarity and the balance between work, family and caring 
responsibilities. Systematic research is required into opportunities and 
limitations, including innovative technology, in the whole field of care 
arrangements over a distance. The demands of the different actors in the 
distance caregiving arrangement are not yet known and are the subject of our 
study.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will develop a model for distance caregiving. A 
qualitative multimethod research design (non-interventional study) will be 
adopted. The study will take place between September 2021 and August 2024. 
Participants will be selected by a purposeful sampling process. Phenomenological 
analysis will guide our data analysis. Data collected in this study will allow 
for triangulation, thereby increasing the trustworthiness of findings.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been granted by 
the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the Charité, 
Universitätsmedizin Berlin (ID: EA1/371/21). Dissemination of the results will 
take place among the scientific community. Results will also be disseminated 
among the public and actors involved in healthcare and nursing care.

Delirium commonly occurs in the palliative care setting and impacts many aspects 
of patient care, such as symptom assessment, patient-clinician communication, 
and medical decision-making. One controversial topic regarding the management of 
delirium in the palliative care setting is whether neuroleptics should be used. 
In this "Controversies in Palliative Care" article, 3 expert clinicians 
independently answer this question. Specifically, each group provides a synopsis 
of the key studies that inform their thought processes, share practical advice 
on their clinical approach, and highlight the opportunities for future research. 
Interestingly, all 3 experts arrived at similar conclusions-they underscored the 
importance of identification and treatment of any reversible causes of delirium 
and endorsed a trial of non-pharmacologic measures. They also agreed that 
neuroleptics should be considered for patients with hyperactive or mixed 
delirium when the conservative measures fail to control delirium symptoms and 
for delirious patients with days of life expectancy and thus limited time to try 
other measures. Risk of adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms and 
seizures should be considered as part of the treatment decision. There is also a 
need to conduct high quality research to examine both neuroleptics and 
neuroleptic-sparing strategies for the management of delirium.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in the United States has declined since 2014 but 
characterization of disparities within and across metropolitan areas of the 
country is lacking.
METHODS: Using census tract-level life expectancy from the 2010 to 2015 US 
Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, we calculate 10 measures of total 
and income-based disparities in life expectancy at birth, age 25, and age 65 
within and across 377 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of the United 
States.
RESULTS: We found wide heterogeneity in disparities in life expectancy at birth 
across MSAs and regions: MSAs in the West show the narrowest disparities 
(absolute disparity: 8.7 years, relative disparity: 1.1), while MSAs in the 
South (absolute disparity: 9.1 years, relative disparity: 1.1) and Midwest 
(absolute disparity: 9.8 years, relative disparity: 1.1) have the widest life 
expectancy disparities. We also observed greater variability in life expectancy 
across MSAs for lower income census tracts (coefficient of variation [CoV] 3.7 
for first vs. tenth decile of income) than for higher income census tracts (CoV 
2.3). Finally, we found that a series of MSA-level variables, including larger 
MSAs and greater proportion college graduates, predicted wider life expectancy 
disparities for all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic and policy factors likely help explain variation 
in life expectancy disparities within and across metro areas.

PURPOSE: The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC), which occurs 
in people under age 50, has been increasing annually. The aim of this study was 
to provide an up-to-date estimate of the global EO-CRC burden.
METHODS: We used Global Burden of Disease Study data and methodologies to 
describe changes in the EO-CRC burden from 1990 to 2019, including incidence, 
prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The driving 
factors for cancer burden variation were further analyzed using decomposition 
analysis. Frontier analysis was used to visually demonstrate the potential for 
burden reduction in each country or region based on their development levels.
RESULTS: The global EO-CRC incidence more than doubled, increasing from 95,737 
(95% uncertainty interval (UI): 90,838-101.042) /100,000 in 1990 to 226,782 (95% 
UI: 207,495-248,604) /100,000 in 2019. Additionally, related deaths increased 
from 50,997 (95% UI: 47,692-54,410) /100,000 to 87,014 (95% UI: 80,259-94,339) 
/100,000, and DALYs increased from 256,1842 (95% UI: 239,4962-2,735,823) 
/100,000 to 4,297,573 (95% UI: 3,965,485-4,650,790) /100,000. Regarding 
age-standardized rates, incidence and prevalence increased significantly, while 
mortality and DALYs rate were basically unchanged. Decomposition analysis showed 
a significant increase in DALYs in the middle sociodemographic index (SDI) 
quintile region, in which aging and population growth played a major driving 
role. Frontier analysis showed that countries or regions with a higher SDI 
quintile tend to have greater improvement potential.
CONCLUSION: The current EO-CRC burden was found to be the greatest in the 
high-middle SDI quintile region and East Asia, which may need to adjust 
screening guidelines accordingly and introduce more effective interventions.

Glutaric aciduria type 1 is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder of lysine 
metabolism caused by pathogenic gene variations in GCDH (cytogenic location: 
19p13.13), resulting in deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase 
(GCDH) and, consequently, accumulation of glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, 
glutaconic acid and glutarylcarnitine detectable by gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry (organic acids) and tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). 
Depending on residual GCDH activity, biochemical high and low excreting 
phenotypes have been defined. Most untreated individuals present with acute 
onset of striatal damage before age 3 (to 6) years, precipitated by infectious 
diseases, fever or surgery, resulting in irreversible, mostly dystonic movement 
disorder with limited life expectancy. In some patients, striatal damage 
develops insidiously. In recent years, the clinical phenotype has been extended 
by the finding of extrastriatal abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction, 
preferably in the high excreter group, as well as chronic kidney failure. 
Newborn screening is the prerequisite for pre-symptomatic start of metabolic 
treatment with low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation and intensified 
emergency treatment during catabolic episodes, which, in combination, have 
substantially improved neurologic outcome. In contrast, start of treatment after 
onset of symptoms cannot reverse existing motor dysfunction caused by striatal 
damage. Dietary treatment can be relaxed after the vulnerable period for 
striatal damage, that is, age 6 years. However, impact of dietary relaxation on 
long-term outcomes is still unclear. This third revision of evidence-based 
recommendations aims to re-evaluate previous recommendations (Boy et al., J 
Inherit Metab Dis, 2017;40(1):75-101; Kolker et al., J Inherit Metab Dis 
2011;34(3):677-694; Kolker et al., J Inherit Metab Dis, 2007;30(1):5-22) and to 
implement new research findings on the evolving phenotypic diversity as well as 
the impact of non-interventional variables and treatment quality on clinical 
outcomes.

In the latter part of the third stage, India is in demographic transition with 
declining fertility and mortality. This marked decline in death rates is driven 
by improvements in health conditions due to medical progress and better living 
conditions. The conventional measures of ageing do not account for the 
significant improvements in health and life expectancy, thus leading to a 
tendency to overestimate the impact of population ageing when these indicators 
are used. The old-age threshold in the conventional measures of ageing depends 
on chronological age. The present study estimated the multi-dimensional old-age 
thresholds (MOAT) based on the remaining life expectancy (RLE), self-rated 
health, activities of daily living (ADL), handgrip strength, and cognition in 
India and selected states. The standard population was derived for each 
dimension for 50 and over in states using the WHO Study on Global AGEing and 
Adult Health data. Keeping the dimensional characteristics as of the standard 
population, the estimated MOAT for India was 67 years where Maharashtra stands 
at the top (68.6), followed by, West Bengal (66.5) and Karnataka (66). A 64 year 
old woman was similar to 68.8 year old man, and a 66 year old rural person was 
equivalent to 68 year old urban person. The study suggests implications of MOATs 
on reducing the burden of ageing and increment in retirement age.

Is age-related sarcopenia a real concern for my developing country?

Gjakova, Gjakova, Kosovo.

Ageing is a distinctive feature of living organisms. With the modernization of 
human societies, including the development of science, technology and education, 
expected life expectancy at birth is being extended. This allows novel 
health-related conditions to gain particular interest amongst the field experts. 
Along comes sarcopenia, an age-related condition of global proportions that 
effects all populations, societies and countries. Several international working 
groups have been trying to identify the more appropriate and applicable 
sarcopenia definition and diagnostic criteria to follow. Contrary to the initial 
muscle mass-related context, the shift of attention to muscle strength by the 
revised European Working Group in Sarcopenia for Older People (EWGSOP2) was 
ground-breaking and potentially game-changing. The suggested diagnostic 
algorithm by the EWGSOP2 for case finding, diagnosing and quantifying the 
severity of cases further facilitated the applicability on clinical practices. 
Since being directly related to the ageing process, sarcopenia presents an issue 
of growing concern particularly within the high-income and developed world 
regions that are generally characterized with an increased life expectancy. In 
contrast, the developing world and their generally lower life expectancy do not 
always have sarcopenia amongst the top targeted health-related concerns. In such 
cases, the expected life expectancy and the populations' quality of life do not 
necessarily present an issue of major interest. Other serious medical concerns 
of acute state often eclipse the need for long-term health-related investments, 
shifting the interest towards only direct interventions and short-term planning. 
In conclusion, the emerging of sarcopenia as a serious age-related concern is 
finding care providers and healthcare systems from lower and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) unprepared. For the time being, it needs to be introduced and 
promoted in the developing world as a condition with direct life-threatening 
implications. Simple and creative forms of approach should be ideated and 
implemented in both scientific and clinical contexts (by researchers and care 
providers, respectively). The best practice to address this situation would be 
by empowering intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations, as well as 
facilitating interconnections between researches, healthcare practitioners and 
clients. This should help establish sarcopenia as a serious age-related 
condition that needs a multidisciplinary and multidimensional approach.

Optimal Cost-Effective Screening Strategy for Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms 
in Female Smokers.

Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of intracranial aneurysms among female cigarette 
smokers was shown to be high in previous studies, yet the cost-effectiveness of 
screening them has never been explored.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the most cost-effective screening strategy for female 
smokers.
METHODS: A decision analytical study was performed with a Markov model to 
compare different screening strategies with no screening and to explore the most 
optimal screening strategy for female smokers. Input data for the model were 
extracted from literature. A single screening at different ages and multiple 
screening every 15 years, 10 years, 5 years, and 2 years were performed for 
female smokers in different age ranges. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model. 
Finally, value of information analysis was performed to investigate the value of 
collecting additional data.
RESULTS: Screening female smokers for unruptured intracranial aneurysm is 
cost-effective. All screening strategies yield extra quality-adjusted life 
years. Screening at younger age brings more health benefit at lower cost. 
Frequent screening strategies decrease rupture rate of aneurysms more with 
higher costs per quality-adjusted life year. Screening after age 70 years and 
frequent screening (every 2 years) after age 60 years is not optimal. Among all 
the parameters in the model, collecting additional data on utility of the 
unscreened population would be most valuable.
CONCLUSION: Screening female smokers for intracranial aneurysms once at younger 
age is most optimal. However, in clinical practice, the duration and intensity 
of exposure to cigarettes should be taken into consideration.

BACKGROUND: The development of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has 
markedly prolonged the life expectancy of individuals with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The prevalence of age-related cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and arrhythmias is therefore expected to increase among the 
HIV-positive population.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the trends in prevalence, and inpatient outcomes 
among patients with HIV and atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: Using ICD-9-CM coding, we identified 38,252,858 HIV-negative and 31,224 
HIV-positive encounters with AF from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 
database from January 2005 to September 2015. Trends in prevalence of HIV in AF 
patients, length and cost of hospital stay, and inpatient mortality, were 
determined. t-Test was used for continuous variables and Chi-square test for 
categorical variables. Final multivariable logistic regression models were 
constructed to determine predictors of outcomes.
RESULTS: Among the 31,224 HIV-positive encounters, 78.6% were males. The median 
age was 56 years for HIV-positive patients and 78 years for HIV-negative 
patients. Black patients were markedly overrepresented among HIV-positive as 
compared to HIV-negative hospitalisations (48.6 vs. 7.6%). The prevalence of 
alcohol and drug use, smoking, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, 
and cancer was higher among HIV-positive as compared to HIV-negative patients. 
The prevalence of HIV among the AF hospitalisations increased from 2005 to 2015. 
As compared to HIV-negative patients, individuals with HIV demonstrated 
increased inpatient mortality (9.2 vs. 5.1%), longer length of stay (6 [3-11] 
vs. 4 [2-7] days), and increased cost of treatment ($12,464 vs. $8606).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HIV among patients with AF increased between 2005 
and 2015. As compared to HIV-negative individuals with AF, a diagnosis of HIV 
was associated with increased inpatient mortality, length of stay, and cost of 
care. Future research on the underlying mechanisms of these findings is 
warranted to inform the treatment of AF in patients with HIV.

Does Primary Care Availability Mediate the Relationship Between Rurality and 
Lower Life Expectancy in the United States?

INTRODUCTION: Rural counties in the United States have lower life expectancy 
than their urban counterparts and comprise the majority of primary care provider 
(PCP) shortage areas. We evaluated whether PCP availability mediates the 
relationship between rurality and lower life expectancy.
METHODS: We performed a mediation analysis on a panel dataset which included 
county-level estimates (N = 3103) for the years 2010, 2015, and 2017, and on a 
subset containing only rural counties (N = 1973), with life expectancy as the 
outcome variable, urbanity as the independent variable, and PCP density as the 
mediating variable. County-level socio-demographic data were included as 
covariates.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PCP density mediated 10.1% of the relationship between 
urbanity and life expectancy in rural counties. Increasing PCP density in rural 
counties with PCP shortages to the threshold of being a non-shortage county (>1 
physician/3500 population, as defined by the Health Resources and Services 
Administration) would be expected to increase mean life expectancy in the county 
by 26.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.4, 49.3) and increasing it to the 
standards recommended by a Secretarial Negotiated Rulemaking Committee would be 
expected to increase mean life expectancy by 65.3 days (95% CI: 42.6, 87.5). PCP 
density is a meaningful mediator of the relationship between urbanity and life 
expectancy. The mediation effect observed was higher in rural counties compared 
to all counties. Understanding how PCP density may be increased in rural areas 
may be of benefit to rural life expectancy.

Older Adults Living in Disadvantaged Areas: Protocol for a Mixed Methods 
Baseline Study on Homes, Quality of Life, and Participation in Transitioning 
Neighborhoods.

BACKGROUND: Swedish policy states that older adults should be able to age safely 
with continued independence and lead active lives. However, this plays out 
differently in different Swedish municipalities depending upon degree of 
demographic change, globalization, and urbanization. Internationally, older 
adults living in disadvantaged areas have worse physical and mental health, 
activity restrictions, and reduced life expectancy. In Sweden, research on how 
disadvantaged areas impact older adults' quality of life is virtually 
nonexistent. We argue that disadvantaged areas exist in both urban and rural 
contexts.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate how older adults' homes and neighborhoods 
influence their community participation, quality of life, identity, and 
belonging in urban and rural disadvantaged areas in Sweden, and how these 
person-context dynamics are experienced by older adults in transitioning 
neighborhoods.
METHODS: The study has a mixed methods design and includes 3 phases. Adults 65 
years and older living in certain urban and rural disadvantaged areas in the 
south of Sweden will be included. Phase 1 is an interview study in which 
qualitative data are collected on neighborhood attachment, identity, and 
belonging through semistructured interviews and photo-elicitation interviews 
with 40 subjects. A variety of qualitative data analysis procedures are used. In 
phase 2, a survey study will be conducted to explore associations between 
observable and self-rated aspects of housing and neighborhood (physical, social, 
and emotional), participation, and quality of life; 400 subjects will be 
recruited and added to the 40 phase-1 subjects for a total of 440. The survey 
will include standardized measures and study-specific questions. Survey data 
will be analyzed with mainstream statistical analyses and structural equation 
modeling to understand the interactions between quality of life, home and 
neighborhood factors, and sociodemographic factors. In phase 3, the integration 
study, survey data from the 40 participants who participated in both data 
collections will be analyzed together with qualitative data with a mixed methods 
analysis approach.
RESULTS: As of the submission of this protocol (August 2022), recruitment for 
the interview study is complete (N=39), and 267 participants have been recruited 
and have completed data collection in the survey study. We expect recruitment 
and data collection to be finalized by December 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: With an increasing proportion of older adults, an increasing number 
of disadvantaged areas, and an increasing dependency ratio in more than 50% of 
Swedish municipalities, these municipalities are transforming and becoming 
increasingly segregated. This study will add unique knowledge on what it is like 
to be older in a disadvantaged area and deepen knowledge on housing and health 
dynamics in later life. Further, the design of the current study will allow 
future follow-up studies to facilitate longitudinal analysis (if funding is 
granted) on aging in a transforming societal context.

PURPOSE: As the life expectancy of cancer survivors continues to improve, cancer 
survivors start or resume their life roles as caregivers themselves. We aim to 
assess the associations between caregiving, cancer diagnosis, and self-reported 
well-being.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) 2016, 2018, and 2020. Outcomes included self-reported general health, 
physical health, mental health, depression, physical inactivity, and poor sleep. 
Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate 
self-reported well-being's adjusted odds ratio (aOR).
RESULTS: Comparable to the proportion of caregivers in the general population, 
approximately 1 out of 5 cancer survivors were caregivers to others. Individuals 
with dual roles were significantly more likely to report poor general health 
(aOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.46-4.11), physical health (aOR = 2.17; 95%CI: 1.32-3.56), 
mental health (aOR = 2.47; 95%CI: 1.31-4.64), depression (aOR = 1.64; 95%CI: 
1.15-2.41), physical inactivity (aOR = 1.56; 95%CI: 1.05-2.31), and poor sleep 
(aOR = 1.48; 95%CI: 1.00-2.19) than the general population. Differential impacts 
of an additional cancer diagnosis on the well-being of caregivers were observed 
by sex, race, and time since cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly four million cancer survivors in the USA are concomitant 
caregivers. Individuals with dual roles reported diminished well-being across a 
variety of measures than caregivers only.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Significant unmet health and psychosocial 
needs exist among individuals with dual roles. Our findings urge for increased 
awareness of this additional role/responsibility in cancer survivors and provide 
direct evidence for healthcare providers and policymakers to develop substantial 
support from the structural level.

Adaptive Oscillator-Based Assistive Torque Control for Gait Asymmetry Correction 
With a nSEA-Driven Hip Exoskeleton.

Qian Y, Yu H, Fu C.

Gait asymmetry is an important clinical characteristic of the hemiplegic gait 
most stroke survivors suffered, leading to restricted functional mobility and 
long-term negative impact on their quality of life. In recent years, robot 
assistance has been proven able to improve stroke patients' functional walking, 
but few studies have been conducted to specifically correct gait asymmetry of 
stroke patients during the whole gait cycle. In this work, an adaptive 
oscillator-based assistive torque control was developed and implemented on a 
unilateral hip exoskeleton driven by a novel nonlinear series elastic actuator 
(nSEA), aiming at correcting gait asymmetry at hip joints during the whole gait 
cycle. The adaptive oscillator-based gait asymmetry detection method extracted 
continuous gait phase and gait asymmetry seamlessly, and then the proposed 
assistive control attempted to correct gait asymmetry by delivering precise 
assistive torques synchronized with the continuous gait phase of the patients' 
gait. An initial experimental study was conducted to evaluate the proposed 
assistive control on seven healthy subjects with artificial impairment. The 
participants walked on a treadmill with assistance from the hip exoskeleton, 
while artificial impairment was added to mimic the hemiplegic gait with both 
spacial and temporal asymmetry (such as reduced hip flexion in the impaired side 
and reduced hip extension in the healthy side). Experimental results suggested 
the effectiveness of the proposed assistive control in restoring gait symmetry 
to levels comparable to a normal gait of the participants ( ).

INTRODUCTION: Psychological disorders are strong predictors of life expectancy 
and have an impact on quality of life. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
disease (ADPKD) is frequently diagnosed before the onset of subjective symptoms. 
Similar to other disorders of genetic origin, ADPKD may be a source of 
remarkable psychological discomfort. One way of coping with emotional distress 
is its suppression, and this could be measured. Our study aimed to provide data 
on the acceptance of illness, the emotional suppression of anger, and both 
anxiety and depression as well as satisfaction with life in young patient 
population of early-stage ADPKD in comparison to healthy demographically matched 
individuals.
METHODS: Fifty patients in the asymptomatic stage of ADPKD with an eGFR >60 
mL/min (4p MDRD) and 50 healthy demographically matched individuals were 
included in this study. Participants filled out a set of psychological 
questionnaires: Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), Courtauld Emotional Control 
Scale (CECS), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS).
RESULTS: Asymptomatic patients with ADPKD had 80% scores indicative of disease 
acceptance in AIS. As compared to healthy individuals, they presented with 
significantly stronger suppression of both anxiety and depression but not anger. 
The ADPKD group had significantly lower satisfaction with life in comparison to 
the healthy group.
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic ADPKD patients had a high level of disease acceptance. 
Anger suppression in this group was comparable to healthy individuals, but 
anxiety and depression were controlled more intensively. Despite the 
asymptomatic course of the disease, ADPKD patients revealed lower satisfaction 
with life in comparison to healthy persons.
