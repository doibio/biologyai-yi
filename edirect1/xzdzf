IMPORTANCE: Glioblastoma is the most lethal primary brain cancer. Clinical 
outcomes for glioblastoma remain poor, and new treatments are needed.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether adding autologous tumor lysate-loaded 
dendritic cell vaccine (DCVax-L) to standard of care (SOC) extends survival 
among patients with glioblastoma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 3, prospective, externally 
controlled nonrandomized trial compared overall survival (OS) in patients with 
newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) and recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) treated 
with DCVax-L plus SOC vs contemporaneous matched external control patients 
treated with SOC. This international, multicenter trial was conducted at 94 
sites in 4 countries from August 2007 to November 2015. Data analysis was 
conducted from October 2020 to September 2021.
INTERVENTIONS: The active treatment was DCVax-L plus SOC temozolomide. The nGBM 
external control patients received SOC temozolomide and placebo; the rGBM 
external controls received approved rGBM therapies.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary and secondary end points compared 
overall survival (OS) in nGBM and rGBM, respectively, with contemporaneous 
matched external control populations from the control groups of other formal 
randomized clinical trials.
RESULTS: A total of 331 patients were enrolled in the trial, with 232 randomized 
to the DCVax-L group and 99 to the placebo group. Median OS (mOS) for the 232 
patients with nGBM receiving DCVax-L was 19.3 (95% CI, 17.5-21.3) months from 
randomization (22.4 months from surgery) vs 16.5 (95% CI, 16.0-17.5) months from 
randomization in control patients (HR = 0.80; 98% CI, 0.00-0.94; P = .002). 
Survival at 48 months from randomization was 15.7% vs 9.9%, and at 60 months, it 
was 13.0% vs 5.7%. For 64 patients with rGBM receiving DCVax-L, mOS was 13.2 
(95% CI, 9.7-16.8) months from relapse vs 7.8 (95% CI, 7.2-8.2) months among 
control patients (HR, 0.58; 98% CI, 0.00-0.76; P < .001). Survival at 24 and 30 
months after recurrence was 20.7% vs 9.6% and 11.1% vs 5.1%, respectively. 
Survival was improved in patients with nGBM with methylated MGMT receiving 
DCVax-L compared with external control patients (HR, 0.74; 98% CI, 0.55-1.00; 
P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, adding DCVax-L to SOC resulted in 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant extension of survival for 
patients with both nGBM and rGBM compared with contemporaneous, matched external 
controls who received SOC alone.

PURPOSE: The use of stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR) in 
advanced cancer care is increasing, yet the cost-effectiveness of 
single-fraction (SF) versus multifraction (MF) SABR in pulmonary oligometastases 
is unknown.
METHODS: A prespecified cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted of the Trans 
Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 13.01 - SAFRON II - randomized trial comparing 
SF with MF SABR in 87 patients with 133 pulmonary oligometastases. A partitioned 
survival model assessed costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over the 
within-trial period (4 years) and longer-term (10 years). Costs reflected a 
societal perspective, expressed in Australian dollars (A$) using 2020 prices and 
were estimated using patient level data on health care utilization for radiation 
therapy (including patient time), post-radiation systemic therapy and treatment 
of adverse effects. Quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was expressed as the cost per QALY 
gained for SF versus MF SABR, with uncertainty assessed using deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: SF cost less than MF for initial therapy (difference of 
A$1194/patient). Mean time to initiation of systemic drug therapy did not differ 
between arms (P = .94). Numerical differences in survival favoring SF resulted 
in greater overall health care use for the within-trial period. The within-trial 
ICER was A$15,821/QALY and A$23,265/QALY over the longer term. Results were most 
sensitive to the cost of postprogression therapies and utility values. The 
sensitivity analysis indicated that SF SABR has a 97% probability of being 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of A$50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: SF has lower initial costs and is highly likely to be 
cost-effective. Time to initiation of systemic therapy associated with disease 
progression is highly patient relevant and is a major driver of 
cost-effectiveness. Comparisons for SF SABR with nonradiation therapy approaches 
to the treatment of pulmonary oligometastases warrant further investigation.

The Class-II AP-endonuclease (XthA) is a mycobacterial DNA base excision repair 
(BER) pathway enzyme that functions in the initial steps. It acts on DNA 
substrates that contain abasic sites to create nicks with 3'-hydroxyl (OH) and 
5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) moieties. The NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) 
is the terminal player in mycobacterial BER and seals such nicks efficiently. 
Here, we demonstrate that the Mtbβ-clamp-MtbXthA complex that exists in the 
initial steps of BER engages with MtbLigA to form a novel tri-component BER 
complex. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments analysis show that the 
three proteins interact with equimolar stoichiometry. Small angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS) analysis and associated studies reveal that the apo 
tri-component BER-complex adopts an extended conformation where MtbXthA is 
sandwiched between the Mtbβ-clamp and MtbLigA. The studies support that in the 
apo-complex MtbXthA binds subsite-I of Mtbβ-clamp through 239QLRFPKK245 motif 
and to MtbLigA by 104DGQPSWSGKP113 motif simultaneously. However, the complex 
adopts a less-extended conformation in the presence of substrate DNA, where 
MtbXthA interactions switch from predominantly subsite-I to subsite-II of the 
Mtbβ-clamp. Overall, the novel tri-component complex prevents futile ligation 
activity of MtbLigA on the product of MtbXthA and ensures forward progression of 
the pathway and productive mycobacterial BER interactions.

PURPOSE: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of 4 radiotherapy modalities to 
treat early breast cancer in the UK. In a subgroup of patients eligible for all 
modalities, we compared whole-breast (WB) and partial breast (PB) radiotherapy 
delivered in either 15 (WB15F, PB15F) or 5 fractions (WB5F, PB5F). In a subgroup 
ineligible for PB radiotherapy, we compared WB15F to WB5F.
METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model to simulate lifetime healthcare 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each modality. This was 
informed by the clinical analysis of two non-inferiority trials (FAST Forward 
and IMPORT LOW) and supplemented with external literature. The primary analysis 
assumed that radiotherapy modality influences health only through its impact on 
locoregional recurrence and radiotherapy-related adverse events.
RESULTS: In the primary analysis, PB5F had the least cost and greatest expected 
QALYs. WB5F had the least cost and the greatest expected QALYs in those only 
eligible for WB radiotherapy. Applying a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
£15,000/QALY, there was a 62% chance that PB5F was the cost-effective 
alternative in the PB eligible group, and there was a 100% chance that WB5F was 
cost-effective in the subgroup ineligible for PB radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionation to 5 fractions and partial breast radiotherapy 
modalities offer potentially important benefits to the UK health system.

BACKGROUND: Present studies on the efficacy and safety of curative 
chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with esophageal cancer reflect heterogenous results 
especially in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
toxicity and efficacy of CRT in patients ≥ 65 years. In a cohort, the focus 
centered around treatment-related toxicity (CTCAE Grade > 3), overall survival 
as well as progression free survival, comparing these rates in-between patients 
older than 70 years to those younger than 70 years.
METHODS: A total of 67 patients older than 65 years (34 (50.7%) were older than 
70 years) met the inclusion criteria for retrospective analysis (period from 
January 2013 to October 2017). Treatment consisted of radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel or fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin with 
the intention of neoadjuvant or definite chemoradiation. A sum of 67 patients 
received CRT (44 (65.6%) patients in neoadjuvant, 23 (34.4%) in definite 
intent). Of these, 22 and 12 patients were older than 70 years (50% and 52.2% in 
both treatment groups, respectively). Median age was 71 years and patients had a 
good physical performance status (ECOG 0: 57.6%, ECOG 1: 27.3%). Median 
follow-up was 24 months. Most patients had advanced tumour stages (T3 stage: 
n = 51, 79.7%) and nodal metastasis (N1 stage: n = 54, 88.5%). A subgroup 
comparison was conducted between patients aged ≤ 70 years and > 70 years.
RESULTS: In severe (CTCAE Grade 3-5) toxicities (acute and late), no significant 
differences were observed between both patient groups (< 70 years 
vs. > 70 years). 21% had acute grade 3 events, 4 patients (4%) had grade 4 
events, and two patients (3%) had one grade 5 event. Late toxicity after CRT was 
grade 1 in 13 patients (22%), grade 2 in two (3%), grade 3 in two (3%), grade 4 
in four (7%), and grade 5 in one (2%). Median overall survival (OS) of all 
patients was 30 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16 months. 
No significant differences were seen for OS (32 months vs. 25 months; p = 0.632) 
and PFS (16 months vs. 12 months; p = 0.696) between older patients treated with 
curative intent and younger ones. Trimodal therapy significantly prolonged both 
OS and PFS (p = 0.005; p = 0.018), regardless of age.
CONCLUSION: CRT in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with esophageal cancer is 
feasible and effective. Numbers for acute and late toxicities can be compared to 
cohorts of younger patients (< 65 years) with EC who received the same 
therapies. Age at treatment initiation alone should not be the determining 
factor. Instead, functional status, risk of treatment-related morbidities, life 
expectancy and patient´s preferences should factor into the choice of therapy.

Long-term sperm storage in eusocial Hymenoptera.

B-1050, Brussels, Belgium.

In internally fertilizing species, sperm transfer is not always immediately 
followed by egg fertilization, and female sperm storage (FSS) may occur. FSS is 
a phenomenon in which females store sperm in a specialized organ for periods 
lasting from a few hours to several years, depending on the species. Eusocial 
hymenopterans (ants, social bees, and social wasps) hold the record for FSS 
duration. In these species, mating takes place during a single nuptial flight 
that occurs early in adult life for both sexes; they never mate again. Males die 
quickly after copulation but survive posthumously as sperm stored in their 
mates' spermathecae. Reproductive females, also known as queens, have a much 
longer life expectancy, up to 20 years in some species. Here, we review what is 
currently known about the molecular adaptations underlying the remarkable FSS 
capacities in eusocial hymenopterans. Because sperm quality is crucial to the 
reproductive success of both sexes, we also discuss the mechanisms involved in 
sperm storage and preservation in the male seminal vesicles prior to 
ejaculation. Finally, we propose future research directions that should broaden 
our understanding of this unique biological phenomenon.

Couple screening aims to identify couples with an increased risk of having a 
child affected with an autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder, in order to 
facilitate informed reproductive decision making. Both expectant parents should 
be screened as a single entity, instead of individual testing. Carrier testing 
was typically performed for a few relatively common recessive disorders 
associated with significant morbidity, reduced life expectancy and often because 
of a considerably higher carrier frequency in a specific population for certain 
diseases. However, new genetic testing technologies enable the expansion of 
screening to multiple conditions, genes and sequence variants. There are 
multiple reproductive options for screening couples at risk, particularly when 
genetic traits are detected in the preconception period.

Trypanosoma brucei Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase POLIB Contains a Novel 
Polymerase Domain Insertion That Confers Dominant Exonuclease Activity.

Trypanosoma brucei and related parasites contain an unusual catenated 
mitochondrial genome known as kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) composed of maxicircles and 
minicircles. The kDNA structure and replication mechanism are divergent and 
essential for parasite survival. POLIB is one of three Family A DNA polymerases 
independently essential to maintain the kDNA network. However, the division of 
labor among the paralogs, particularly which might be a replicative, 
proofreading enzyme, remains enigmatic. De novo modeling of POLIB suggested a 
structure that is divergent from all other Family A polymerases, in which the 
thumb subdomain contains a 369 amino acid insertion with homology to DEDDh DnaQ 
family 3'-5' exonucleases. Here we demonstrate recombinant POLIB 3'-5' 
exonuclease prefers DNA vs RNA substrates and degrades single- and 
double-stranded DNA nonprocessively. Exonuclease activity prevails over 
polymerase activity on DNA substrates at pH 8.0, while DNA primer extension is 
favored at pH 6.0. Mutations that ablate POLIB polymerase activity slow the 
exonuclease rate suggesting crosstalk between the domains. We show that POLIB 
extends an RNA primer more efficiently than a DNA primer in the presence of 
dNTPs but does not incorporate rNTPs efficiently using either primer. 
Immunoprecipitation of Pol I-like paralogs from T. brucei corroborates the pH 
selectivity and RNA primer preferences of POLIB and revealed that the other 
paralogs efficiently extend a DNA primer. The enzymatic properties of POLIB 
suggest this paralog is not a replicative kDNA polymerase, and the noncanonical 
polymerase domain provides another example of exquisite diversity among DNA 
polymerases for specialized function.

Metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a major health burden due 
to its increasing incidence and poor prognosis. PDAC is characterized by a low 
tumor mutational burden, and its molecular pathogenesis is driven by Kirsten rat 
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations. Response to DNA damage through 
homologous repair is defective in 15% of tumors. Chemotherapy using FOLFIRINOX 
(folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) or 
gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel significantly improves life expectancy, but the 
median overall survival remains <1 year. Targeted therapies are not efficient in 
the overall population of patients with metastatic PDAC. Improvements in overall 
survival or progression-free survival, however, have been demonstrated in 
subgroups carrying certain mutations. Maintenance therapy with poly-ADP-ribose 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors increases progression-free survival in patients 
with germline mutations in BRCA1/2. Sotorasib shows signs of efficacy against 
tumors carrying the KRAS G12C mutation, and targeted therapies may also benefit 
patients with KRAS-wild-type PDAC. Combining targeted therapies with 
chemotherapy holds promise because of potential synergistic effects. These 
associations, however, have not yet demonstrated clinical benefit. Checkpoint 
inhibitors are not effective against metastatic PDAC. Combined immunotherapies 
attempt to restore their efficacy but have not succeeded yet. Other 
immunotherapies are emerging such as therapeutic vaccines or chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR) T cells, but these strategies remain to be evaluated in large 
trials. In the future, treatment personalization based on tumor-derived 
organoids could potentially further improve treatment efficiency.

BACKGROUND: HER2-targeted therapies have substantially improved outcomes for 
patients with HER2-positive breast and gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction 
cancers. Several other cancers exhibit HER2 expression or amplification, 
suggesting that HER2-targeted agents can have broader therapeutic impact. 
Zanidatamab is a humanised, bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against two 
non-overlapping domains of HER2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
safety and anti-tumour activity of zanidatamab across a range of solid tumours 
with HER2 expression or amplification.
METHODS: This first-in-human, multicentre, phase 1, dose-escalation and 
expansion trial included patients aged 18 years and older, with a life 
expectancy of at least 3 months, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0 or 1, and locally advanced or metastatic, 
HER2-expressing or HER2-amplified solid tumours of any kind who had received all 
available approved therapies. The primary objectives of part 1 were to identify 
the maximum tolerated dose, optimal biological dose, or recommended dose of 
zanidatamab; all patients were included in the primary analyses. Part 1 followed 
a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, including different intravenous doses (from 5 
mg/kg to 30 mg/kg) and intervals (every 1, 2, or 3 weeks). The primary objective 
of part 2 was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of zanidatamab monotherapy 
in solid tumours. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02892123), and parts 1 and 2 of the trial are complete. Part 3 of the study 
evaluates the use of zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy and is 
ongoing.
FINDINGS: Recruitment took place between Sept 1, 2016, and March 13, 2021. In 
Part 1 (n=46), no dose-limiting toxicities were detected and the maximum 
tolerated dose was not reached. The recommended dose for part 2 (n=22 for 
biliary tract cancer; n=28 for colorectal cancer; and n=36 for other 
HER2-expressing or HER2-amplified cancers excluding breast or gastro-oesophageal 
cancers; total n=86) was 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The most frequent 
treatment-related adverse events in part 1 of the study were diarrhoea (24 [52%] 
of 46 patients; all grade 1-2) and infusion reactions (20 [43%] of 46 patients; 
all grade 1-2). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events in part 2 of 
the study were diarrhoea (37 [43%] of 86 patients; all grade 1-2 except for one 
patient) and infusion reactions (29 [34%] of 86 patients; all grade 1-2). A 
total of six grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were reported in four (3%) 
of 132 patients. In part 2, 31 (37%; 95% CI 27·0-48·7) of 83 evaluable patients 
had a confirmed objective response. There were no treatment-related deaths.
INTERPRETATION: These results support that HER2 is an actionable target in 
various cancer histologies, including biliary tract cancer and colorectal 
cancer. Evaluation of zanidatamab continues in ongoing studies.

PURPOSE: To compare the cost-benefit of active surveillance (AS) against 
immediate fine needle aspiration (FNA) of sonographically suspicious 
subcentimeter thyroid nodules.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the 
cost-benefit of 3 strategies from the point of discovery until death: (a) 
Surveillance of all nodules, (b) Surveillance of nodules with positive cytology, 
and (c) Surgery of nodules with positive cytology. The reference case was a 
40-year-old woman with a sonographically suspicious subcentimeter thyroid 
nodule. Transition probabilities, costs, and health state utilities were derived 
from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model 
uncertainty. Willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/quality-adjusted 
life year.
RESULTS: Surveillance of nodules with positive cytology dominated in the 
reference scenario and was cost-beneficial over Surveillance of all nodules, 
independent of the utility of AS. Surveillance of all nodules was 
cost-beneficial only at a life expectancy of <2.6 years or surveillance duration 
of <4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: While current guidelines recommend AS of sonographically suspicious 
subcentimeter nodules, the results of this study suggest that immediate FNA 
(Surveillance of nodules with positive cytology) is more cost-beneficial than AS 
(Surveillance of all nodules). Patients with positive cytology on FNA may 
subsequently opt for AS (Surveillance of nodules with positive cytology) or 
surgery (Surgery of nodules with positive cytology) according to their level of 
comfort (ie, utility) with AS.

Infantile fibrosarcoma is a rare childhood tumour that originates in the fibrous 
connective tissue of the long bones for which there is an urgent need to 
identify novel therapeutic targets. This study aims to clarify the role of the 
extracellular matrix component hyaluronan in the invasion of child fibroblasts 
and Infantile fibrosarcoma into the surrounding environment. Using nanoscale 
super-resolution STED (Stimulated emission depletion) microscopy followed by 
computational image analysis, we observed, for the first time, that invasive 
child fibroblasts showed increased nanoscale clustering of hyaluronan at the 
cell periphery, as compared to control cells. Hyaluronan was not observed within 
focal adhesions. Bioinformatic analyses further revealed that the increased 
nanoscale hyaluronan clustering was accompanied by increased gene expression of 
Hyaluronan synthase 2, reduced expression of Hyaluronidase 2 and CD44, and no 
change of Hyaluronan synthase 1 and Hyaluronidases 1, 3, 4 or 5. We further 
observed that the expression of the Hyaluronan synthase 1, 2 and 3, and the 
Hyaluronidase 3 and 5 genes was linked to reduced life expectancy of 
fibrosarcoma patients. The invasive front of infantile fibrosarcoma tumours 
further showed increased levels of hyaluronan, as compared to the tumour centre. 
Taken together, our findings are consistent with the possibility that while 
Hyaluronan synthase 2 increases the levels, the Hyaluronidases 3 and 5 reduce 
the weight of hyaluronan, resulting in the nanoscale clustering of hyaluronan at 
the leading edge of cells, cell invasion and the spread of Infantile 
fibrosarcoma.

Specific to the West African sub-region, previous studies involving fruit, stem, 
and bark of Tetrapleura tetraptera as well as seeds of Monodora myristica have 
largely focused on phytochemical properties of aqueous and methanolic and 
ethanolic extracts. To supplement existing information, the chemical 
composition, antibacterial efficacy (tested against Escherichia coli and 
Staphylococcus aureus), and antioxidant capacity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 
(DPPH∙) radical scavenging, ferric reducing power, and total antioxidant 
capacity) of essential oil and oleoresin extracted from T. tetraptera fruit and 
M. myristica seeds cultivated in Southeast Nigeria, were studied. Essential oil 
and oleoresin were respectively extracted by steam distillation and aqueous 
maceration. By way of gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, the 
chemical compounds from essential oil and oleoresin from M. myristica and T. 
Tetraptera samples totaled 6 and 5, as well as 27 and 16, respectively. Besides 
the oleoresin of M. myristica and the essential oil of T. tetraptera showing 
some resistance against S. aureus, the oleoresins seemed highly susceptible to 
E. coli-all of which demonstrated concentration-dependence to the antibacterial 
inhibition zone. Scavenging DPPH radical, reduction power activity, and total 
antioxidant capacity increased with essential oil and oleoresin extracts' 
concentrations, which positions M. myristica and T. tetraptera spices as very 
promising for food preservation, especially against autoxidation and microbial 
spoilage.

Observations on the kinematic characteristics of the healthy side of the knee in 
stroke patients: A cross-sectional study.

The abnormal gait of stroke patients not only severely limits the recovery of 
their walking ability, but also seriously affects their quality of daily life. 
Previous observational studies have focused too much on the observation of 
single degree of freedom and axial knee motion angles in stroke patients. 
Changes in the multi-degree of freedom and multi-axial joint angles of the knee 
have been less frequently observed, leading to somewhat limited conclusions. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to use the Opti-knee motion test to analyze 
in real time the motion of the knee in all directions on the healthy side of 
stroke patients and to compare it with normal gait to provide a clinical basis 
for subsequent rehabilitation. In a cross-sectional study, 120 subjects (60 
stroke patients were as the observation group and 60 healthy subjects as the 
control group) were studied. Both groups of subjects were tested for Opti-Knee 
tri-axial angles of motion of the healthy side of the knee, including flexion 
and extension, internal and external rotation, internal and external turning, 
anterior and posterior displacement, superior and inferior displacement, left 
and right displacement, maximum extension angle and maximum flexion angle. 
Compared with the control group, there were significant changes in the joint 
angles of flexion and extension, internal and external rotation, internal and 
external turning, maximum extension and maximum flexion of the knee on the 
healthy side in the observation group, and the differences were statistically 
significant [95%(37.22, 45.13), P = .01], [95%(9.51,13.67), P = .018], 
[95%(4.82,7.57), P = .049], [95%(4.12, 8.63), P = .019], [95%(51.68, 57.28), 
P = .0001]. However, there was no significant change in the angle of motion of 
the healthy side of the knee for anterior-posterior displacement, 
superior-inferior displacement and internal-external displacement in either 
group and the differences were not statistically significant [95%(1.16, 1.78), 
P = .72], [95%(0.85,1.32), P = .32], [95%(0.57, 0.88), P = .36]. This study 
confirms the importance of changes in the angle of motion of the knee on the 
side of the stroke patient in maintaining the stability of the knee joint. 
Therefore, their bilateral lower limb symmetry training should be paid attention 
to in the subsequent rehabilitation treatment.

The demographic situation of the Russian Federation is characterized by an aging 
population, which is a new challenge to achieve active and healthy longevity. 
The purpose of the study is to identify the factors influencing the increase in 
active longevity based on the results of the analysis of statistical data on the 
proportion of people over 60 years of age and life expectancy and sociological 
studies. On the basis of official statistics, the analysis of life expectancy, 
the proportion of people over 60 years old was carried out. The obtained data of 
the sociological study revealed that in order for the Russian Federation to 
follow the course of increasing active and healthy longevity, it must focus on 
the determinants of socio-economic character. On the basis of the age-shifting 
method, the forecast of the proportion of people over 60 years old was carried 
out (using the example of one of the regions of the Russian Federation). The 
Center for Family and Demography of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of 
Tatarstan has developed recommendations for achieving active and healthy 
longevity, which are presented in the annual Demographic report of the Republic 
of Tatarstan, by improving health and reducing mortality.

Proactive cognitive control is thought to rely on the active maintenance of 
goals or contextual information in working memory. It is often measured using 
the AX-CPT, in which antecedent cues (A/B) are used to proactively prepare a 
response to a subsequently-presented probe (X/Y). Although control in this task 
purportedly requires active maintenance of information in working memory, it 
also provides conditions in which learning the contingencies between relevant 
events could influence performance via associative learning. We tested this 
hypothesis using a dot-pattern expectancy version of the AX-CPT whereby a set of 
new rules (test phase) for responding changed the control operations required 
for some previously trained cues, while keeping the operations the same for 
others, allowing us to measure associative interference. We also tested the 
relationship between associative interference and working memory capacity 
(operation span; Experiments 1-3) and tested the effect of applying working 
memory load during the initial acquisition period (Experiment 2) and during the 
test phase (Experiment 3). We found robust evidence of interference after the 
rule change based on previously learnt contingencies, suggesting that learnt 
contingencies come to influence proactive planning, even when they are 
task-irrelevant. This associative effect had no relationship with working memory 
capacity or load, based on a load manipulation commonly used in executive 
control tasks. The findings suggest that proactive control does not always 
require active maintenance of current goals and environmental cues in working 
memory. Instead, proactive control may run on autopilot if the individual can 
rely upon stable relationships in the environment to trigger planning and
