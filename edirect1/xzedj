Although polyethylene glycol (PEG), or "PEGylation" has become a widely applied 
approach for improving the efficiency of drug delivery, the immunogenicity and 
non-biodegradability of this synthetic polymer have prompted an evident need for 
alternatives. To overcome these caveats and to mimic PEG -or other natural or 
synthetic polymers- for the purpose of drug half-life extension, unstructured 
polypeptides are designed. Due to their tunable length, biodegradability, low 
immunogenicity and easy production, unstructured polypeptides have the potential 
to replace PEG as the preferred technology for therapeutic protein/peptide 
delivery. This review provides an overview of the evolution of unstructured 
polypeptides, starting from natural polypeptides to engineered polypeptides and 
discusses their characteristics. Then, it is described that unstructured 
polypeptides have been successfully applied to numerous drugs, including 
peptides, proteins, antibody fragments, and nanocarriers, for half-life 
extension. Innovative applications of unstructured peptides as releasable masks, 
multimolecular adaptors and intracellular delivery carriers are also discussed. 
Finally, challenges and future perspectives of this promising field are briefly 
presented. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Polypeptide fusion technology simulating 
PEGylation has become an important topic for the development of long-circulating 
peptide or protein drugs without reduced activity, complex processes, and kidney 
injury caused by PEG modification. Here we provide a detailed and in-depth 
review of the recent advances in unstructured polypeptides. In addition to the 
application of enhanced pharmacokinetic performance, emphasis is placed on 
polypeptides as scaffolders for the delivery of multiple drugs, and on the 
preparation of reasonably designed polypeptides to manipulate the performance of 
proteins and peptides. This review will provide insight into future application 
of polypeptides in peptide or protein drug development and the design of novel 
functional polypeptides.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of Multi-specialty 
INterprofessional Team (MINT) Memory Clinic care in comparison to the provision 
of usual care.
DESIGN: Using a Markov-based state transition model, we performed a cost-utility 
(costs and quality-adjusted life years, QALY) analysis of MINT Memory Clinic 
care and usual care not involving MINT Memory Clinics.
SETTING: A primary care-based Memory Clinic in Ontario, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: The analysis included data from a sample of 229 patients assessed 
in the MINT Memory Clinic between January 2019 and January 2021.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness as measured in QALY, costs (in Canadian 
dollars) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculated as the 
incremental cost per QALY gained between MINT Memory Clinics versus usual care.
RESULTS: MINT Memory Clinics were found to be less expensive ($C51 496 (95% Crl 
$C4806 to $C119 367) while slightly improving quality of life (+0.43 (95 Crl 
0.01 to 1.24) QALY) compared with usual care. The probabilistic analysis showed 
that MINT Memory Clinics were the superior treatment compared with usual care 
98% of the time. Variation in age was found to have the greatest impact on 
cost-effectiveness as patients may benefit from the MINT Memory Clinics more if 
they receive care beginning at a younger age.
CONCLUSION: Multispecialty interprofessional memory clinic care is less costly 
and more effective compared with usual care and early access to care 
significantly reduces care costs over time. The results of this economic 
evaluation can inform decision-making and improvements to health system design, 
resource allocation and care experience for persons living with dementia. 
Specifically, widespread scaling of MINT Memory Clinics into existing primary 
care systems may assist with improving quality and access to memory care 
services while decreasing the growing economic and social burden of dementia.

OBJECTIVES: Myocarditis, a health-threatening heart disease, is attracting 
increasing attention. This systematic study was conducted to study the 
prevalence of disease through the trends of incidence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over the last 30 years, which would be 
helpful for the policymakers to better the choices for reasonable decisions.
METHODS: The global, regional, and national burdens of myocarditis from 
1990-2019 were analyzed by using the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
database. This study on myocarditis produced new findings according to age, sex, 
and Social-Demographic Index (SDI) by investigating DALYs, age-standardized 
incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and corresponding 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC).
RESULTS: The number of myocarditis incidence increased by 62.19%, from 780,410 
cases in 1990 to 1,265,770 cases in 2019. The ASIR decreased by 4.42% (95%CI, 
from -0.26% to -0.21%) over the past 30 years. The number of deaths from 
myocarditis increased by 65.40% from 19,618 in 1990 to 324,490 in 2019, but the 
ASDR was relatively stable over the investigated period. ASDR increased in 
low-middle SDI regions (EAPC=0.48; 95%CI, 0.24 to 0.72) and decreased in low SDI 
regions (EAPC=-0.97; 95%CI, from -1.05 to -0.89). The age-standardized DALY rate 
decreased by 1.19% (95%CI, from -1.33% to -1.04%) per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the ASIR and DALY for myocarditis decreased and the ASDR 
was stable over the past 30 years. The risk of incidences and death cases 
increased with age. Measures should be taken to control the risk of myocarditis 
in high-burden regions. Medical supplies should be improved in the high-middle 
SDI regions and middle SDI regions to reduce the deaths from myocarditis in 
these regions.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the disease burden of cataract and 
evaluate the contributions of risk factors to cataract-associated 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prevalence and DALYs of visual impairment due to cataract 
were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019 to explore 
time trends and annual changes. Regional and country-level socioeconomic indexes 
were obtained from open databases. The time trend of prevalence and DALYs was 
demonstrated. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to evaluate 
associations between the age-standardized rate of DALYs of cataract and 
potential predictors.
RESULTS: Global Prevalence rate of visual impairment due to cataract rose by 
58.45% to 1,253.9 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 1,103.3 to 1,417.7 per 100,000 
population) in 2019 and the DALYs rate rose by 32.18% from 65.3 per 100,000 
population (95% CI: 46.4 to 88.2 per 100,000 population) in 1990 to 86.3 per 
100,000 population (95% CI: 61.5 to 116.4 per 100,000 population) in 2019. 
Stepwise multiple linear regression model showed that higher refractive error 
prevalence (β = 0.036, 95% CI: 0.022, 0.050, P < 0.001), lower number of 
physicians per 10,000 population (β = -0.959, 95% CI: -1.685, -0.233, P = 
0.010), and lower level of HDI (β = -134.93, 95% CI: -209.84, -60.02, P = 0.001) 
were associated with a higher disease burden of cataract.
CONCLUSION: Substantial increases in the prevalence of visual impairment and 
DALYs of cataract were observed from 1990 to 2019. Successful global initiatives 
targeting improving cataract surgical rate and quality, especially in regions 
with lower socioeconomic status, is a prerequisite to combating this growing 
burden of cataract in the aging society.

Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have significantly lower 
life-expectancy than healthy people. Previously, we have identified baseline 
neurocognitive function in general and verbal memory and executive function in 
particular as related to mortality nearly two decades later. In this study, we 
aim to replicate these findings with a larger and age-matched sample. The 
patient group consisted of 252 individuals, 44 of whom were deceased and 206 
alive. Neurocognition was assessed with a comprehensive battery. Results showed 
that the deceased group, compared to the living group, had significantly more 
severe neurocognitive deficits across nearly all domains. There were no 
differences in sex, remission status, psychosis symptoms, or function level 
between the groups. Immediate verbal memory and executive function were the 
strongest predictors of survival status. These results were nearly identical to 
our previous studies, and we conclude that baseline neurocognitive function is 
an important predictor for mortality in SSD. Clinicians should be mindful of 
this relationship in patients with significant cognitive deficits.

OBJECTIVES: There is little nationally representative information about factors 
associated with longevity among older Brazilians.
METHODS: Baseline survey data from the Brazilian longitudinal Study of Aging 
(ELSI-Brazil) were linked to vital statistics systems. Mortality rates and life 
expectancy estimates were calculated and compared to official sources. Cox 
Proportional Hazards models and Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) 
identified significant predictors of mortality. Results: Calculated mortality 
rates and life expectancy estimates were similar to official statistics for most 
ages with higher risk of death among older ages, as expected. High School 
completion, being partnered, and female sex were negatively associated with 
mortality, while being underweight, previous diagnosis of a chronic condition, 
having any functional limitations, poor self-rated health, low grip strength, 
and smoking were all associated with higher mortality risk. Discussion: The 
ELSI-Brazil study has potential to identify factors associated with longevity 
and to inform programs and policies designed to enhance healthy aging among 
older adults in Brazil.

The world's human population is reaching record longevities. Consequently, our 
societies are experiencing the impacts of prolonged longevity, such as increased 
retirement age. A major hypothesized influence on aging patterns is resource 
limitation, formalized under calorie restriction (CR) theory. This theory 
predicts extended organismal longevity due to reduced calorie intake without 
malnutrition. However, several challenges face current CR research and, although 
several attempts have been made to overcome these challenges, there is still a 
lack of holistic understanding of how CR shapes organismal vitality. Here, we 
conduct a literature review of 224 CR peer-reviewed publications to summarize 
the state-of-the-art in the field. Using this summary, we highlight the 
challenges of CR research in our understanding of its impacts on longevity. We 
demonstrate that experimental research is biased toward short-lived species 
(98.2% of studies examine species with <5 years of mean life expectancy) and 
lacks realism in key areas, such as stochastic environments or interactions with 
other environmental drivers (eg, temperature). We argue that only by considering 
a range of short- and long-lived species and taking more realistic approaches, 
can CR impacts on longevity be examined and validated in natural settings. We 
conclude by proposing experimental designs and study species that will allow the 
discipline to gain much-needed understanding of how restricting caloric intake 
affects long-lived species in realistic settings. Through incorporating more 
experimental realism, we anticipate crucial insights that will ultimately shape 
the myriad of sociobioeconomic impacts of senescence in humans and other species 
across the Tree of Life.

BACKGROUNDPeople living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
exhibit persistent immune dysregulation and microbial dysbiosis, leading to 
development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We initially compared plasma 
proteomic profiles between 205 PLHIV and 120 healthy control participants (HCs) 
and validated the results in an independent cohort of 639 PLHIV and 99 HCs. 
Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were then associated to microbiome 
data. Finally, we assessed which proteins were linked with CVD development in 
PLHIV.METHODSProximity extension assay technology was used to measure 1,472 
plasma proteins. Markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein, D-dimer, 
IL-6, soluble CD14, and soluble CD163) and microbial translocation (IFABP) were 
measured by ELISA, and gut bacterial species were identified using shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing. Baseline CVD data were available for all PLHIV, and 205 
PLHIV were recorded for development of CVD during a 5-year 
follow-up.RESULTSPLHIV receiving ART had systemic dysregulation of protein 
concentrations, compared with HCs. Most of the DEPs originated from the 
intestine and lymphoid tissues and were enriched in immune- and lipid 
metabolism-related pathways. DEPs originating from the intestine were associated 
with specific gut bacterial species. Finally, we identified upregulated proteins 
in PLHIV (GDF15, PLAUR, RELT, NEFL, COL6A3, and EDA2R), unlike most markers of 
systemic inflammation, associated with the presence and risk of developing CVD 
during 5-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONOur findings suggest a systemic dysregulation 
of protein concentrations in PLHIV; some proteins were associated with CVD 
development. Most DEPs originated from the gut and were related to specific gut 
bacterial species.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov

Osteomyelitis in Sickle Cell Anemia: Does Age Predict Risk of Salmonella 
Infection?

Hegeman EM(1), Bates T, Lynch T, Schmitz MR.

Surgery, Fort Sam Houston, TX.

BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis is a condition that disproportionately affects those 
with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Despite the frequency of osteomyelitis in this 
population, there are reports of increasing life expectancy and rates of 
Staphylococcus aureus infections, which contrasts the belief that Salmonella is 
the most common organism identified. The purpose of this systematic review is to 
determine the most commonly identified organism and identify whether age is 
associated with the development of Salmonella osteomyelitis in homozygous sickle 
cell patients.
METHODS: A search of PubMed, EMBASE Cochrane and databases was performed for 
studies of all levels of evidence pertaining to osteomyelitis in SCA. Reasons 
for exclusion included non-English language, case reports, literature reviews, 
isolated septic arthritis without bony involvement and isolated oral-facial bony 
involvement.
RESULTS: The most common pathogen cultured was nontyphoid Salmonella , which 
occurred in 117 of 192 (60.9%) of cases identified. This was followed by S. 
aureus 41 of 192 (21.8%) and other enteric bacteria 14 of 192 (7.2%). Subgroup 
analysis demonstrated differences at the age of initial presentation with 
Salmonella cohort at 6.8 years and S. aureus cohort at 22.1 years ( P = 0.0001). 
On geographic analysis, African countries had an older average age of diagnosis 
at 13.1 years with decreased rates of Salmonella infections and increased rates 
of infections from other organisms compared with the US, Middle East and Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that Salmonella is most commonly 
identified in patients with SCA (HbSS phenotype) especially those <12 years old 
presenting with acute osteomyelitis. Sub-Saharan African countries had later 
ages of diagnosis compared with the US, Middle East and Europe with bacterial 
profiles that favors a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis and missed acute 
initial presentation. Therefore, age of presentation is likely a surrogate for 
geographic and socioeconomic factors such as availability of medical screening 
and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Depression affects 25%-30% of people with HIV (PWH) in the Republic 
of South Africa (RSA) and is associated with both antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
nonadherence and increased mortality. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
task-shifted, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PWH with diagnosed 
depression and virologic failure from a randomized trial in RSA.
SETTING: RSA.
METHODS: Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications model, we 
simulated both trial strategies: enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) and ETAU 
plus CBT for ART adherence and depression (CBT-AD; 8 sessions plus 2 
follow-ups). In the trial, viral suppression at 1 year was 20% with ETAU and 32% 
with CBT-AD. Model inputs included mean initial age (39 years) and CD4 count 
(214/μL), ART costs ($7.5-22/mo), and CBT costs ($29/session). We projected 5- 
and 10-year viral suppression, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs: $/QALY [discounted 
3%/yr]; cost-effectiveness threshold: ≤$2545/QALY [0.5× per capita GDP]). In 
sensitivity analyses, we determined how input parameter variation affected 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Model-projected 5- and 10-year viral suppression were 18.9% and 8.7% 
with ETAU and 21.2% and 9.7% with CBT-AD, respectively. Compared with ETAU, 
CBT-AD would increase discounted life expectancy from 4.12 to 4.68 QALYs and 
costs from $6210/person to $6670/person (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: 
$840/QALY). CBT-AD would remain cost-effective unless CBT-AD cost >$70/session 
and simultaneously improved 1-year viral suppression by ≤4% compared with ETAU.
CONCLUSIONS: CBT for PWH with depression and virologic failure in RSA could 
improve life expectancy and be cost-effective. Such targeted mental health 
interventions should be integrated into HIV care.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Parapharyngeal masses are rare but critical because 
of their deep location and their important anatomical relationships with the 
surrounding structures. Their management poses a challenge in terms of 
etiological diagnosis and adequate therapeutic approach. The clinical and 
especially the radiological examination have an important role not only for the 
diagnosis but also for the determination of the appropriate management and for 
the orientation towards the nature of the mass.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 44-year-old man with a 
parapharyngeal lipoma that caused mainly obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Once 
in our structure after a radiological examination (MRI and CT scan), a decision 
for surgical management was made. Surgery consisted on a combined cervical and 
endobuccal approach. The follow-up showed an effective result with the total 
resolution of the discomfort caused by the mass, which improved the patient's 
quality of life.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Tumors in this space represent less than 1 % of all head 
and neck tumors and are usually benign. Symptoms leading the patient to consult 
a doctor only appear after a significant volume of the mass, which makes the 
severity of this pathology. Imaging, namely CT and MRI, should be requested 
systematically in case of suspicion of any parapharyngeal mass. Several surgical 
approaches are described in the literature, the choice between them depends on 
the nature of the mass, its location and especially its extension, hence the 
interest of preoperative imaging.
CONCLUSION: The main take-away lessons are the great value of imaging in the 
diagnosis and treatment of parapharyngeal space masses, the relationships of 
this region and its content make the surgery very delicate, so it's so important 
to choose the appropriate surgical approach.

INTRODUCTION: The 16-week randomised, placebo-controlled INCREASE trial (RCT) 
met its primary end-point by improving 6-min walk distance (6MWD) in patients 
receiving inhaled treprostinil for pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial 
lung disease (PH-ILD). The open-label extension (OLE) evaluated long-term 
effects of inhaled treprostinil in PH-ILD.
METHODS: Of 258 eligible patients, 242 enrolled in the INCREASE OLE and received 
inhaled treprostinil. Assessments included 6MWD, pulmonary function testing, 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), quality of life and 
adverse events. Hospitalisations, exacerbations of underlying lung disease and 
death were recorded.
RESULTS: At INCREASE OLE baseline, patients had a median age of 70 years and a 
mean 6MWD of 274.2 m; 52.1% were male. For the overall population, the mean 6MWD 
at week 52 was 279.1 m and the mean change from INCREASE RCT baseline was 3.5 m 
(22.1 m for the prior inhaled treprostinil arm and -19.5 m for the prior placebo 
arm); the median NT-proBNP decreased from 389 pg·mL-1 at RCT baseline to 
359 pg·mL-1 at week 64; and the absolute (% predicted) mean forced vital 
capacity change from RCT baseline to week 64 was 51 mL (2.8%). Patients who 
received inhaled treprostinil versus placebo in the RCT had a 31% lower relative 
risk of exacerbation of underlying lung disease in the OLE (hazard ratio 0.69 
(95% CI 0.49-0.97); p=0.03). Adverse events leading to drug discontinuation 
occurred in 54 (22.3%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the long-term safety and efficacy of inhaled 
treprostinil in patients with PH-ILD, and are consistent with the results 
observed in the INCREASE RCT.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant morbidity and shortened 
life expectancy. Similarly, patients with transfusion dependent beta thalassemia 
(TdT) require life-long transfusion therapy, chelation therapy and significant 
organ dysfunction. Allogeneic transplantation from a matched family donor 
provided the only curative option for patients with SCD and TdT. Unfortunately, 
less than 20% of patients have a fully matched related donor and results using 
unrelated donor transplant were associated with high rate of complications. Ex 
vivo gene therapy through globin gene addition has been investigated extensively 
and recent encouraging preliminary data resulted in regulatory approval in 
patients with TdT. Recent improvements in our understanding of the molecular 
pathways controlling erythropoiesis and globin switching from fetal hemoglobin 
to adult hemoglobin offer a new and exciting therapeutic options. Rapid and 
substantial advances in genome editing tools using CRISPR/Cas9, have raised the 
possibility of genetic editing and correction in patient derived hematopoietic 
stem and progenitor cells. We will review results of gene editing approach that 
can induce fetal hemoglobin production in patients with SCD and TdT.

BACKGROUND: It is not clearly known how well Danes estimate their chances of 
reaching the average life expectancy and whether identifiable population 
subgroups misestimate their life expectancy, and potentially also investments 
and savings in health and pensions. Therefore, in this study, we examined on the 
individual level whether subjective life expectancy is in line with the 
statistically calculated chance of reaching age 85, and further explored the 
psychological and behavioral factors associated with under or overestimation.
METHODS: We opted for a cross-sectional survey design based on a sample of 5,379 
Danish citizens aged 50-70 years, returning a web-based questionnaire with 
socio-demographic data supplemented from a national registry. Average 
participant estimates of their chance of reaching age 85 for each age range and 
sex group were compared with actuarial data. We then performed multiple linear 
regression analyses to examine factors associated with the subjective expectancy 
of reaching age 85 years.
RESULTS: We found that 32% of females and 23% of males reported 100% certainty 
of reaching age 85, and average expected survival chance exceeded the 
statistically predicted survival chance for 23% of males and 16% for females in 
age-ranges 50-60 and 61-70. Our multivariable analysis found that health 
literacy, internal health locus of control, willingness to take health risks, 
self-rated health, and health and life satisfaction all showed a significant 
positive association with expectation of reaching age 85. Moreover, those on 
daily medications, ex- or current smokers, and heavy drinkers were significantly 
less optimistic about reaching age 85.
CONCLUSIONS: Particularly for the population groups with inaccurate life 
expectancies, the significant associations with psychological and behavioral 
factors open a way for initiatives based on behavior change theories to reach a 
better agreement between subjective and statistical life expectancy.

Job's syndrome, or autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (AD-HIES, 
STAT3-Dominant Negative), is a rare inborn error of immunity (IEI) with 
multi-organ involvement and long-life post-infective damage. Longitudinal 
registries are of primary importance in improving our knowledge of the natural 
history and management of these rare disorders. This study aimed to describe the 
natural history of 30 Italian patients with AD-HIES recorded in the Italian 
network for primary immunodeficiency (IPINet) registry. This study shows the 
incidence of manifestations present at the time of diagnosis versus those that 
arose during follow up at a referral center for IEI. The mean time of diagnostic 
delay was 13.7 years, while the age of disease onset was < 12 months in 66.7% of 
patients. Respiratory complications, namely bronchiectasis and pneumatoceles, 
were present at diagnosis in 46.7% and 43.3% of patients, respectively. 
Antimicrobial prophylaxis resulted in a decrease in the incidence of pneumonia 
from 76.7% to 46.7%. At the time of diagnosis, skin involvement was present in 
93.3% of the patients, including eczema (80.8%) and abscesses (66.7%). At the 
time of follow-up, under therapy, the prevalence of complications decreased: 
eczema and skin abscesses reduced to 63.3% and 56.7%, respectively. Antifungal 
prophylaxis decreased the incidence of mucocutaneous candidiasis from 70% to 
56.7%. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, seven patients developed COVID-19. 
Survival analyses showed that 27 out of 30 patients survived, while three 
patients died at ages of 28, 39, and 46 years as a consequence of lung bleeding, 
lymphoma, and sepsis, respectively. Analysis of a cumulative follow-up period of 
278.7 patient-years showed that early diagnosis, adequate management at 
expertise centers for IEI, prophylactic antibiotics, and antifungal therapy 
improve outcomes and can positively influence the life expectancy of patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The 30-day expected mortality rate is frequently used 
as a metric to determine which patients benefit from palliative radiation 
treatment (RT). We conducted a narrative review to examine whether its use as a 
metric might be appropriate for patient selection.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify relevant studies that 
highlight the benefits of palliative RT in timely symptom management among 
patients with a poor performance status, the accuracy of predicting survival 
near the end of life and ways to speed up the process of RT administration 
through rapid response clinics.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Several trials have demonstrated substantial response 
rates for pain and/or bleeding by four weeks and sometimes within the first two 
weeks after RT. Models of patient survival have limited accuracy, particularly 
for predicting whether patients will die within the next 30 days. Dedicated 
Rapid Access Palliative RT (RAPRT) clinics, in which patients are assessed, 
simulated and treated on the same day, reduce the number of patient visits to 
the radiation oncology department and hence the burden on the patient as well as 
costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction palliative RT should be offered to eligible 
patients if they are able to attend treatment and could potentially benefit from 
symptom palliation, irrespective of predicted life expectancy. We discourage the 
routine use of the 30-day mortality as the only metric to decide whether to 
offer RT. More common implementation of RAPRT clinics could result in a 
significant benefit for patients of all life expectancies, but particularly 
those having short ones.

AIM: Bacillus subtilis var. natto is used in the production of natto, a typical 
Japanese fermented soybean food. Although the probiotic attributes and 
health-related effects of B. subtilis var. natto have been reported, the effect 
on longevity remains unknown. In the present study, the effects of B. subtilis 
var. natto strains on lifespan extension and the molecular mechanisms governing 
the prolongevity were examined using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Synchronized 3-day-old (young adult) worms were fed 
Escherichia coli OP50 (control) or a subcloned isolate of B. subtilis var. natto 
Miyagino strain (MI-OMU01) and subjected to lifespan, survival against pathogens 
and abiotic stress resistance assays. Notably, the lifespan of worms fed 
MI-OMU01 was significantly longer than that of the animals fed OP50. Moreover, 
MI-OMU01 increased the resistance of C. elegans to several stressors, including 
UV irradiation, H2O2, and Cu2+.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic and gene expression analyses using mutant animals suggested 
that MI-OMU01 extended the lifespan of worms in TIR-1/SARM, p38 MAPK, and 
insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway-dependent manners.
