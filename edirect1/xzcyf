responses of the primary caregivers for IQI states only. These coefficients were 
then normalized using the rank-ordered logit model based on the responses from 
the general population who assessed "death" as a choice option. In this way, the 
values were rescaled from full health (1.0) to death (0.0), and consequently, 
they became suitable for the computation of quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: The total sample consisted of 1409 members of the general population 
and 1229 primary caregivers. Results indicated that, out of the 7 IQI items 
("sleeping," "feeding," "breathing," "stooling/poo," "mood," "skin," and 
"interaction"), "breathing" had the highest impact on the HRQoL of infants. 
Moreover, except for "stooling," all item levels were statistically significant. 
The general population sample considered none of the health states as worse than 
death. The utility value for the worst health state was 0.015 (State 4444444).
CONCLUSIONS: The IQI is the first generic instrument to assess overall HRQoL in 
0-1-year-old infants by providing values and utilities. Using discrete choice 
experiments, we demonstrated that it is possible to derive utilities of infant 
health states. The next step will be to collect IQI values in a clinical 
population of infants and to compare these values with those of other 
instruments.

Historical representation of collective identity offer means of influencing the 
extent to which group members engage in activities in line with the collective 
interests of their group vs. their own individual interests. This research 
tested the effect of different historical representations of the African people 
on Africans' perceptions of African social identity and engagement in identity 
management strategies across two studies. In Study 1 (N = 162), we tested the 
effect of two historical representations: positive (prestigious precolonial 
African history and resistance to the colonial power) and negative (inhumane 
practices of precolonial Africans). In Study 2 (N = 431), we tested the effect 
of two historical representations: positive (prestigious precolonial African 
history) and negative factual (inhuman practices of precolonial Africans) while 
also making salient the ubiquitous historical representation of the African 
people (negative colonial-perspective) across all history conditions. We 
predicted that positive (vs. negative) historical representation would lead to 
more positive perceptions of African identity, which in turn would predict more 
collectively-oriented identity management strategies. Altogether, results 
provided no support for these predictions. We highlight methodological (and by 
extension theoretical) features-such as, psychological reactance and outgroup 
audience effect-which may have limited the effect of the manipulations to help 
inform the interpretation of the null findings obtained. We conclude by 
discussing other limitations and the theoretical implications of our work, 
before pointing out various avenues for future research to help us better test, 
and understand, the role of historical representation in the African context.

OBJECTIVE: Both endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and biologic therapies have shown 
effectiveness for medically-refractory chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
(CRSwNP) without severe asthma. The objective was to evaluate cost-effectiveness 
of dupilumab versus ESS for patients with CRSwNP.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic model with a 36-year 
time horizon.
METHODS: A cohort of 197 CRSwNP patients who underwent ESS were compared with a 
matched cohort of 293 CRSwNP patients from the SINUS-24 and SINUS-52 Phase 3 
studies who underwent treatment with dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks. Utility 
scores were calculated from the SNOT-22 instrument in both cohorts. 
Decision-tree analysis and a 10-state Markov model utilized published event 
probabilities and primary data to calculate long-term costs and utility. The 
primary outcome measure was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY), which is expressed as an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio. One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The ESS strategy cost $50,436.99 and produced 9.80 QALYs. The dupilumab 
treatment strategy cost $536,420.22 and produced 8.95 QALYs. Because dupilumab 
treatment was more costly and less effective than the ESS strategy, it is 
dominated by ESS in the base case. One-way sensitivity analyses showed ESS to be 
cost-effective versus dupilumab regardless of the frequency of revision surgery 
and at any yearly cost of dupilumab above $855.
CONCLUSIONS: The ESS treatment strategy is more cost effective than dupilumab 
for upfront treatment of CRSwNP. More studies are needed to isolate potential 
phenotypes or endotypes that will benefit most from dupilumab in a 
cost-effective manner.

Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of myocardial disorders of mostly 
unknown etiology, and they occur commonly in cats. In some cats, they are 
well-tolerated and are associated with normal life expectancy, but in other cats 
they can result in congestive heart failure, arterial thromboembolism or sudden 
death. Cardiomyopathy classification in cats can be challenging, and in this 
consensus statement we outline a classification system based on cardiac 
structure and function (phenotype). We also introduce a staging system for 
cardiomyopathy that includes subdivision of cats with subclinical cardiomyopathy 
into those at low risk of life-threatening complications and those at higher 
risk. Based on the available literature, we offer recommendations for the 
approach to diagnosis and staging of cardiomyopathies, as well as for management 
at each stage.

Naturally occurring tumor in animals receiving high minerals from deep oceans 
(DOM: hardness 600 mg/L) from 6 months of age until natural death was firstly 
assessed in 200 Sprague Dawley rats, randomized into four groups: Control (C), 
DOM (D), Fructose (F), and Fructose + DOM (FD). Fructose drink contained 11% 
fructose. Tumor incidence (necropsy at death) in the D group was ~40% lower than 
that in the C group (P < .05), together with lower body mass gain and greater 
locomotive activity during their initial 18 months (P < .05) but not during 
later life. X-ray image analysis on abnormal solid tissue among survivors at 18 
and 24 months of age confirms a similar trend, exhibiting ~50% and ~65% lower 
tumor incidence than the C and F groups, respectively. Reduced-to-oxidized 
glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) declined with age for the first three quarters of 
life on all groups (P < .05), followed by a resurgence during end-life among 
survivors at 24 months. This resurgence is markedly associated with lower tumor 
expansion but unrelated with DOM supplementation. Our results demonstrate 
valuable application of minerals and trace elements from deep oceans, as a 
vastly available natural source, on tumor suppression during normal aging.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the 24-month cost-effectiveness of supervised treatment 
compared to written advice in knee osteoarthritis (OA).
DESIGN: 100 adults with moderate-severe OA not eligible for total knee 
replacement (TKR) randomized to a 12-week individualized, supervised treatment 
(exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or written advice. 
Effectiveness was measured as change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from 
baseline to 24 months, including data from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, 
while healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national 
registries after final follow-up. Incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A 
sensitivity analysis resampling existing data was conducted and the probability 
of cost-effectiveness was estimated using a 22,665 Euros/QALY threshold. In a 
sensitivity analysis, cost-effectiveness was calculated for different costs of 
the supervised treatment (actual cost in study; cost in private practice; and 
in-between cost).
RESULTS: Average costs were similar between groups (6,758 Euros vs 6,880 Euros), 
while the supervised treatment were close to being more effective (incremental 
effect (95% CI) of 0.075 (-0.005 to 0.156). In the primary analysis excluding 
deaths, this led the supervised treatment to be cost-effective, compared to 
written advice. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were 
sensitive to changes in the cost of treatment, but in all scenarios the 
supervised treatment was cost-effective (ICERs of 6,229 to 20,688 Euros/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: From a 24-month perspective, a 12-week individualized, supervised 
treatment program is cost-effective compared to written advice in patients with 
moderate-severe knee OA not eligible for TKR.

OBJECTIVE: Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) imposes significant 
impairment on patient quality of life and often requires immediate surgical 
intervention. In this study the authors sought to estimate the impact of 
surgical intervention on patient quality of life in the form of mean 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and identify factors associated with 
positive outcomes.
METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review and collected data 
for patients who had neurological symptoms resulting from radiologically and 
histologically confirmed MSCC and were treated with surgical decompression 
during the last 12 years.
RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included in this study (mean age 60.4 
years, 57.6% males). The 5 most common metastatic tumor types were lung, 
multiple myeloma, renal, breast, and prostate cancer. The majority of patients 
had radioresistant tumors (82.7%) and had an active primary site at presentation 
(67.5%). The median time from tumor diagnosis to cord compression was 12 months 
and the median time from identification of cord compression to death was 4 
months. Preoperative presenting symptoms included motor weakness (70.8%), pain 
(70.1%), sensory disturbances (47.6%), and bowel or bladder disturbance (31.1%). 
The median estimated blood loss was 500 mL and the average length of hospital 
stay was 10.3 days. About 18% of patients had postoperative complications and 
the mean follow-up was 7 months. The mean pre- and postoperative ECOG (Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status grades were 3.2 and 2.4, 
respectively. At follow-up, 58.3% of patients had improved status, 31.5% had no 
improvement, and 10.0% had worsening of functional status. The mean QALY gained 
per year in the entire cohort was 0.55. The mean QALY gained in the first 6 
months was 0.1 and in the first year was 0.4. For patients who lived 1-2, 2-3, 
3-4, or 4-5 years, the mean QALY gained were 0.8, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.3, 
respectively. Preoperative motor weakness, bowel dysfunction, bladder 
dysfunction, and ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class were 
identified as independent predictors inversely associated with good outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The mean QALY gained from surgical decompression in the first 6 
months and first year equals 1.2 months and 5 months of life in perfect health, 
respectively. These findings suggest that surgery might also be beneficial to 
patients with life expectancy < 6 months.

Unhealthy diets are commonly associated with increased disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) from noncommunicable diseases. The association between DALYs and 
dietary patterns can be quantified with individual longitudinal data. This 
assessment, however, is often based on dietary data collected once at cohort 
entry, therefore reflecting the impact of "old" dietary habits on morbidity and 
mortality. To overcome this limitation, we tested the association of 
contemporary diets with DALYs. First, we defined contemporary dietary patterns 
consumed in Switzerland with the national nutrition survey menuCH (2014-2015). 
Second, we identified individuals who consumed similar diets in the NRP-MONICA 
census-linked cohort (1977-2015). In this cohort, individual data on disease and 
mortality were used to calculate the DALYs-dietary patterns association using a 
mixed regression model. A total of 58,771 DALYs from NCDs were recorded in a 
mean follow-up time of 25.5 years. After multivariable adjustments, the "Swiss 
traditional" pattern was not associated with an increase in DALYs compared to 
the "Prudent" pattern. However, individuals following a "Western" pattern had, 
on average 0.29 DALYs (95% CI 0.02, 0.56) more than those following a "Prudent" 
pattern, equating to a loss of healthy life of more than three months. These 
data highlight the feasibility of quantifying the impact of contemporary diets 
on DALYs without the establishment of new cohorts or the use of nationally 
aggregated data.

BACKGROUND: Health behaviours like smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption and 
physical activity (SNAP) are often studied separately, while combinations can be 
particularly harmful. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of 
lifestyle choices by studying the prevalence of (combinations of) unhealthy SNAP 
behaviours in relation to attitudinal factors (time orientation, risk attitude) 
and subjective health (self-rated health, life expectancy) among the adult Dutch 
population.
METHODS: In total 1006 respondents, representative of the Dutch adult population 
(18-75 years) in terms of sex, age, and education, were drawn from a panel in 
2016. They completed an online questionnaire. Groups comparisons and logistic 
regression analyses (crude and adjusted) were applied to analyse (combinations 
of) SNAP behaviours in relation to time orientation (using the Consideration of 
Future Consequences scale comprising Immediate (CFC-I) and Future (CFC-F) 
scales) and risk attitude (Health-Risk Attitude Scale; HRAS-6), as well as 
subjective health (visual analogue scale and subjective life expectancy).
RESULTS: In the analyses, 989 respondents (51% men, average 52 years, 22% low, 
48% middle, and 30% high educated) were included. About 8% of respondents 
engaged in four unhealthy SNAP behaviours and 18% in none. Self-rated health 
varied from 5.5 to 7.6 in these groups, whilst subjective life expectancy ranged 
between 73.7 and 85.5 years. Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for 
socio-demographic variables, showed that smoking, excessive drinking and 
combining two or more unhealthy SNAP behaviours were significantly associated 
with CFC-I scores, which increased the odds by 30%, 18% and 19%, respectively. 
Only physical inactivity was significantly associated with CFC-F scores, which 
increased the odds by 20%. Three out of the four SNAP behaviours were 
significantly associated with HRAS-6, which increased the odds between 6% and 
12%. An unhealthy diet, excessive drinking, and physical inactivity were 
significantly associated with SRH, which decreased the odds by 11%. Only smoking 
was significantly associated with subjective life expectancy, which decreased 
the odds by 3%.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that attitudinal factors and subjective health 
are relevant in the context of understanding unhealthy SNAP behaviours and their 
clustering. This emphasizes the relevance of a holistic approach to health 
prevention rather than focusing on a single unhealthy SNAP behaviour.

BACKGROUND: Child and adolescent injury is one of the leading causes of child 
death globally with a large proportion occurring in Low- and Middle-Income 
Countries (LMICs). Similarly, the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries 
borne a heavy burden that largely impact child and adolescent safety and health 
in the region. We aim to assess child and adolescent injury morbidity and 
mortality and estimate its burden in the Eastern Mediterranean Region based on 
findings from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Injuries and Risk Factors 
study 2017.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease GBD 2017 were used to estimate 
injury mortality for children aged 0-19, Years of Life Lost (YLLs), Years lived 
with Disability (YLDs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) by age and sex 
from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: In 2017, an estimated 133,117 (95% UI 122,587-143,361) children died in 
EMR compared to 707,755 (95% UI 674401.6-738,166.6) globally. The highest rate 
of injury deaths was reported in Syria at 183.7 (95% UI 181.8-185.7) per 100,000 
population. The leading cause of injury deaths was self-harm and interpersonal 
violence followed by transport injury. The primary cause of injury DALYs in EMR 
in 2017 was self-harm and interpersonal violence with a rate of 1272.95 (95% UI 
1228.9 - 1319.2) almost 3-times the global rate.
CONCLUSION: Almost 19% of global child injury related deaths occur in the EMR. 
Concerted efforts should be integrated to inform policies and adopt injury 
preventive strategies to reduce injury burden and promote child and adolescent 
health and well-being in EMR countries.

BACKGROUND: Oesophageal cancer is a common and often fatal cancer that has two 
main histological subtypes: oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma. Updated statistics on the incidence and mortality of oesophageal 
cancer, and on the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by the disease, 
can assist policy makers in allocating resources for prevention, treatment, and 
care of oesophageal cancer. We report the latest estimates of these statistics 
for 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, by age, sex, and 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD).
METHODS: We used data from vital registration systems, vital 
registration-samples, verbal autopsy records, and cancer registries, combined 
with relevant modelling, to estimate the mortality, incidence, and burden of 
oesophageal cancer from 1990 to 2017. Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) were 
estimated and fed into a Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) including risk 
factors. MIRs were used for mortality and non-fatal modelling. Estimates of 
DALYs attributable to the main risk factors of oesophageal cancer available in 
GBD were also calculated. The proportion of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
to all oesophageal cancers was extracted by use of publicly available data, and 
its variation was examined against SDI, the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) 
Index, and available risk factors in GBD that are specific for oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (eg, unimproved water source and indoor air pollution) 
and for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease).
FINDINGS: There were 473 000 (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI] 459 000-485 000) 
new cases of oesophageal cancer and 436 000 (425 000-448 000) deaths due to 
oesophageal cancer in 2017. Age-standardised incidence was 5·9 (5·7-6·1) per 
100 000 population and age-standardised mortality was 5·5 (5·3-5·6) per 100 000. 
Oesophageal cancer caused 9·78 million (9·53-10·03) DALYs, with an 
age-standardised rate of 120 (117-123) per 100 000 population. Between 1990 and 
2017, age-standardised incidence decreased by 22·0% (18·6-25·2), mortality 
decreased by 29·0% (25·8-32·0), and DALYs decreased by 33·4% (30·4-36·1) 
globally. However, as a result of population growth and ageing, the total number 
of new cases increased by 52·3% (45·9-58·9), from 310 000 (300 000-322 000) to 
473 000 (459 000-485 000); the number of deaths increased by 40·0% (34·1-46·3), 
from 311 000 (301 000-323 000) to 436 000 (425 000-448 000); and total DALYs 
increased by 27·4% (22·1-33·1), from 7·68 million (7·42-7·97) to 9·78 million 
(9·53-10·03). At the national level, China had the highest number of incident 
cases (235 000 [223 000-246 000]), deaths (213 000 [203 000-223 000]), and DALYs 
(4·46 million [4·25-4·69]) in 2017. The highest national-level age-standardised 
incidence rates in 2017 were observed in Malawi (23·0 [19·4-26·5] per 100 000 
population) and Mongolia (18·5 [16·4-20·8] per 100 000). In 2017, 
age-standardised incidence was 2·7 times higher, mortality 2·9 times higher, and 
DALYs 3·0 times higher in males than in females. In 2017, a substantial 
proportion of oesophageal cancer DALYs were attributable to known risk factors: 
tobacco smoking (39·0% [35·5-42·2]), alcohol consumption (33·8% [27·3-39·9]), 
high BMI (19·5% [6·3-36·0]), a diet low in fruits (19·1% [4·2-34·6]), and use of 
chewing tobacco (7·5% [5·2-9·6]). Countries with a low SDI and HAQ Index and 
high levels of indoor air pollution had a higher proportion of oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma to all oesophageal cancer cases than did countries with 
a high SDI and HAQ Index and with low levels of indoor air pollution.
INTERPRETATION: Despite reductions in age-standardised incidence and mortality 
rates, oesophageal cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality and burden 
across the world. Oesophageal cancer is a highly fatal disease, requiring 
increased primary prevention efforts and, possibly, screening in some high-risk 
areas. Substantial variation exists in age-standardised incidence rates across 
regions and countries, for reasons that are unclear.

An evidence-based understanding of factors influencing PPE use and pesticide 
safety practices has the benefit of facilitating the design of interventions to 
minimize exposure to pesticides and the promotion of the utilization of PPE and 
safety practices among agricultural pesticide handlers. The aim of this study, 
therefore, is to review the available literature on the use of PPE in 
agricultural pesticide handlers in world regions, and also the factors 
associated with the use of PPE and pesticide safety practices in farmers and 
farm workers. Full-text articles published on PubMed, Scopus, and ISI databases 
between 1999 and 2019 were reviewed and the scientific evidence was evaluated. 
One hundred and twenty-one articles were eligible for inclusion in this 
quantitative synthesis: 110 evaluated PPE use in agricultural pesticide 
handlers, and 23 focused on factors affecting PPE use and pesticide safety 
practices. Considerable evidence was found to show that the most basic PPE worn 
among pesticide handlers in all world regions was a long sleeve shirt (66.1%), 
long sleeve trousers (71.1%), and a hat (47.3%). The lowest basic PPE worn was 
an apron (8.6%), goggles (24.3%), gloves (40.5%), boots (42.3%), and mask 
(43.2%). The PPE worn (except for an apron) was proportionally higher in farmers 
than in farm workers. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the 
significant determinants associated with PPE use and pesticide safety practices 
are as follows: (1) demographic factors (i.e. education/literacy level, 
experience of illness, income); (2) farm structure factors (i.e. farm size); (3) 
behavioral and psychosocial factors (i.e. contact with pesticides, perceptions, 
attitudes, awareness, norms and beliefs); and (4) environmental factors (i.e. 
information about pesticides, access to extension services, training program, 
and farm organization). Therefore, there is a recognizable need for a life-long 
education program with training to change the perception and behavior of 
pesticide handlers sustainably.

BACKGROUND: Population aging is dynamic process of increasing proportion of 
older adults in the total population, which is an inescapable result of decline 
in fertility rate and extension in life expectancy. Inevitably, age-related 
metabolic diseases, for example obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, 
dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, are becoming epidemic 
globally along with the demographic transition.
CONTENT: The review examines the literatures related to: 1) the epidemiology of 
age related metabolic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic 
syndrome, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; and 2) the risk 
factors of age related metabolic diseases including genetic factors, diet, 
smoking, Physical activity, intestinal microbiota and environmental factors.
CONCLUSION: Population aging is becoming epidemic worldwide, resulting in 
increasing incidence and prevalence of a serious of age-related metabolic 
diseases. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the diseases, 
thus interventions targeting on these factors may have beneficial effect on the 
development of age-related metabolic diseases.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an uncommon genetic immunodeficiency 
disorder affecting neutrophil function, characterized by recurrent bacterial and 
fungal infections. X-linked carriers of CGD have an increased risk of autoimmune 
disorders, in particular lupus like disorders. We describe the case of a 
37 years old female carrier of X-linked CGD, who presented with clinical 
features and serology consistent with a definite diagnosis of Systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), with rare immune mediated neurological manifestations 
including secondary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis and Longitudinally 
extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), responsive to immunomodulation. These 
neurological manifestations have not been described previously in carriers of 
CGD. We recommend early diagnosis of these immune mechanisms, especially in 
X-linked carriers of CGD, and appropriate immunomodulation in order to improve 
life expectancy and improve neurological outcome.

With global improvements in life expectancy, one important concern is to 
understand whether there is reduction in inequalities or greater cross-country 
convergence in expected length of life at various age thresholds. Insights on 
convergence patterns can help governments and other stakeholders decide upon 
health investments across age groups. This paper applies a novel econometric 
approach to test convergence and identify convergent clubs in life expectancy at 
various age groups for 201 countries/areas between 1950 and 2015. Life 
expectancy estimates for 201 countries/areas (1950 and 2015) from United Nations 
Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) World Population Prospects 
(2015 Revision) are used for the analysis. We find global convergence in life 
expectancy at birth, but do not observe grand convergence for any other age 
groups. In the case of life expectancy at younger ages, most countries are 
moving in the same direction, but significant cross-country variations and 
convergence clubs are noted for older adults and elderly. Most of the better 
performing countries/areas are from Western Europe, Northern Europe and North 
America, the average performers are from South America, Eastern Europe, Southern 
Europe, South Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Africa, Central Africa, and the 
Caribbean Islands whereas the poor-performing ones are mainly Western Africa, 
Southern African and Oceania. In addition, we observe increasing between-country 
variance in life expectancy for older adults and elderly. The analysis reveals 
increasing global heterogeneity in the survival experience of older adults and 
the elderly population which has remained a neglected aspect in the discussions 
on global life expectancy improvements. Data, research and policy focus on 
life-expectancy at older ages is therefore critical to accelerate survival gains 
among older adults and elderly, particularly from the developing world.

AIMS: The past 3 decades witnessed the rapid growth of diabetes in China. To 
better serve large numbers of patients, the Chinese Medical Doctor Association 
launched metabolic management center (MMC) program which is featured with a 
one-stop and comprehensive diabetes management mode in 2016. It is worth 
exploring whether MMC model is better than conventional models in management.
METHODS: In this study, 228 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited, and 
193 patients completed the study. Therapeutic effects and health care costs were 
analyzed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that decreases in HbA1C and TG/HDL-C 
values were significantly greater in the MMC group than in the control group. 
The increase in HDL-C was significantly higher in the MMC group than in the 
control group. The percentage of patients whose HbA1C lower than 7% was 
significantly higher in the MMC group. The results of the UKPDS model simulation 
showed that within 30 years, with the slight increases in treatment costs, the 
average life expectancy and total QALE of the MMC group are higher than those of 
the control group by 0.61 and 0.51 year, respectively. Further study showed that 
the drug intervention in the MMC group was significantly stronger. In addition, 
the questionnaires revealed that MMC group performed better in diabetes 
knowledge tests and have higher patient satisfaction rates of medical services. 
More patients in the MMC group adopted a more favorable diet strategy. These 
advantages enable MMC to achieve more short-term and long-term benefits in 
diabetes treatment than conventional mode.

PURPOSE: Brazil is the largest country in South America. Although a developing 
nation, birth rates have been decreasing in the last few decades, while its 
overall population is undergoing lifestyle changes and ageing significantly. 
Moreover, Brazil has had increasingly high mortality rates related to colorectal 
cancer (CRC). Herein, we investigated whether the Brazilian population is 
exhibiting increasing mortality rates related to colon cancer (CC) or rectal 
cancer (RC) in recent years.
METHODS: We examined data from the Brazilian Federal Government from 1979 to 
2015 to determine whether CRC mortality and the population ageing process may be 
associated.
RESULTS: Our mathematical modelling suggests that mortality rates related to CC 
and RC events in the Brazilian population may increase by 79% and 66% in the 
next 24 years, respectively. This finding led us to explore the mortality rates 
for both diseases in the country, and we observed that the highest levels were 
in the south and southeast regions from the year 2000 onwards. CC events appear 
to decrease life expectancy among people during their second decade of life in 
recent years, whereas RC events induced decreases in life expectancy in those 
aged >30 years. Additionally, both CC and RC events seem to promote significant 
mortality rates in the male population aged > 60 years and living in the 
southern states.
CONCLUSION: Our dataset suggests that both CC and RC events may lead to a 
significantly increasing number of deaths in the Brazilian male population in 
coming years.

Background: Physical attributes of conventional stents used in the ilio-caval 
territory are often unfavorable in the presence of external compression close to 
the bifurcation. A hybrid oblique stent was developed for the treatment of 
common iliac vein compression without compromising the contralateral iliac vein 
inflow. Patients and methods: The ongoing international monitored TOPOS study 
enrolled 60 patients with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) treated with the 
sinus-Obliquus stent (optimed) and provisional distal stent extension. At 
3-month follow-up, patency rates were obtained from duplex ultrasound, and 
clinical outcomes were assessed by the Villalta score, revised venous severity 
score (rVCSS), pain intensity score and chronic venous disease quality of life 
questionnaire (CIVIQ-20). Results: Mean age was 46.6 ± 14.9 years (68.3 % 
women). Mean number of implanted stents was 1.9 ± 0.6; 12 (20 %) patients 
received the hybrid oblique stent only. Forty-eight (80 %) patients had distal 
stent extension, and 42 (70 %) had stents below the inguinal ligament. Four (7 
%) patients (all with stent extension) developed stent thrombosis. Primary and 
secondary patency rates at 3 months were 93.1 % (95 %CI 83.3-98.1 %), and 100 % 
(95 %CI 93.8-100 %), respectively. Improvement in Villalta, rVCSS, CIVIQ-20, and 
pain intensity score from baseline to 3-month follow-up was 6.9 ± 1.4 points 
(95 %CI 4.1-9.8; p < 0.0001), 3.4 ± 1.0 points (95 %CI 1.3-5.4 points;
