that will affect their nutritional status. The development of geriatric foods 
such as cream soup made from pumpkin and tempeh is considered to be the solution 
to prevent this situation. This study used a factorial randomized design, 
containing processing methods (fresh and instant) and the addition of tempeh 
(0%, 75%, and 100%). Sensory evaluation (rating and ranking test), physical 
characteristics (pH, yield, rehydration, and viscosity), nutritional analysis 
(proximate, crude fibre, dietary fibre, vitamins B6 and B12, and β-carotene 
content), and acceptance analysis of cream soup fresh and instant were examined. 
Physical characterization revealed that the product had a pH of 5.4-5.7, a 
viscosity of 1250-2190 cP, a rehydration ratio of 5.51-6.47 g mL-1, and a yield 
of 19.44%-26.9%. The result of sensory evaluation showed that the processing 
method and tempeh addition had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the product 
acceptance. This also affects the nutritional value, in which fresh products had 
higher nutritional value than the instant product, and products with tempeh had 
higher ash, protein, dietary fibre, and vitamin B12 than products without 
tempeh. Based on this analysis, the instant cream soup with 75% tempeh is the 
best formula. In one portion size (50 g), instant cream soup with 75% tempeh met 
10% or more of the Indonesian recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for the 
elderly in terms of protein, carbohydrates, fat, energy, dietary fibre, vitamin 
B12, vitamin B6, and vitamin A, so it can be recommended as a complementary food 
for the elderly.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer (Gilead) of filgotinib (JyselecaTM), as part of the single 
technology appraisal process, to submit evidence for its clinical and cost 
effectiveness for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with 
Maastricht University Medical Centre, was commissioned to act as the independent 
Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), 
presents the ERG's critical review of the clinical- and cost-effectiveness 
evidence in the CS, highlights the key methodological considerations, and 
describes the development of the NICE guidance by the NICE Appraisal Committee. 
The evidence for filgotinib was based on two good-quality international 
randomised controlled trials. In FINCH 1, filgotinib was compared with placebo, 
and in FINCH 2, filgotinib was compared with adalimumab and placebo. As there 
was no head-to-head evidence with most active comparators, the company performed 
two separate network meta-analyses (NMAs), one for the conventional 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-inadequate response population and one for 
the biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-inadequate response 
population. The outcomes analysed were American College of Rheumatology response 
criteria at weeks 12 and 24, and European League Against Rheumatism response 
criteria at 24 weeks. The statistical methods used to perform the NMAs were 
valid and were in line with previous NICE appraisals. Results of the NMAs are 
confidential and cannot be reported here, but they were uncertain due to 
heterogeneity of the included studies. The economic analysis of the patient 
population with moderate RA suffered from limited evidence on the progression 
from moderate to severe health states. For the moderate RA population, the final 
analyses comparing filgotinib, with or without methotrexate, against standard of 
care resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of around £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained in the company's and ERG's base-case and 
scenario analyses. NICE recommended filgotinib in combination with methotrexate 
or as monotherapy when methotrexate is contraindicated, or if people cannot 
tolerate it, for patients with moderate RA whose disease had responded 
inadequately to two or more conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs). For the severe RA population, in view of the higher or similar net 
health benefits that filgotinib provided versus its comparators, NICE 
recommended filgotinib with or without methotrexate for patients whose disease 
had responded inadequately to two or more conventional DMARDs, who had been 
treated with one or more biological DMARDs, if rituximab was not an option, or 
after treatment with rituximab.

Introduction. The aim was to evaluate the effect of therapeutic plasma exchange 
(TPE) and eculizumab on hematological and renal survival in atypical hemolytic 
uremic syndrome (aHUS), and additionally, to examine the reliability of 
discontinuation of eculizumab treatment.Methods. This was an observational and 
retrospective study of 18 patients diagnosed with aHUS.Results. The median age 
of the study population was 30 (22-66) years. Four of 18 patients achieved 
hematological remission with the TPE alone. However, one patient died after 
three sessions of TPE. Eculizumab was used in 13 patients and no death was 
observed. One year after treatment, improved kidney function was observed in 2 
of 3 (66%) patients for TPE and 5 of 9 (56%) patients for Eculizumab. We 
discontinued eculizumab treatment in 9 patients. One of the patients who had a 
C3 gene mutation experienced disease relapse after Eculizumab discontinuation. 
None of the patients who had drug associated aHUS developed disease relapse 
after Eculizumab discontinuation.Conclusion. Eculizumab treatment is a 
life-saving therapy in aHUS. Treatment discontinuation may be considered at 
least six months after hematologic remission in patients who had stable renal 
function or no expectancy for renal survival. Moreover, drug-associated cases 
seem to tend not to develop disease relapse in the long term.

The processing of tomato fruit into puree, juices, ketchup, sauces, and dried 
powders generates a significant amount of waste in the form of tomato pomace, 
which includes seeds and skin. Tomato processing by-products, particularly 
seeds, are reservoirs of health-promoting macromolecules, such as proteins 
(bioactive peptides), carotenoids (lycopene), polysaccharides (pectin), 
phytochemicals (flavonoids), and vitamins (α-tocopherol). Health-promoting 
properties make these bioactive components suitable candidates for the 
development of novel food and nutraceutical products. This review 
comprehensively demonstrates the bioactive compounds of tomato seeds along with 
diverse biomedical activities of tomato seed extract (TSE) for treating 
cardiovascular ailments, neurological disorders, and act as antioxidant, 
anticancer, and antimicrobial agent. Utilization of bioactive components can 
improve the economic feasibility of the tomato processing industry and may help 
to reduce the environmental pollution generated by tomato by-products.

Nuclear group I introns are restricted to the ribosomal DNA locus where they 
interrupt genes for small subunit and large subunit ribosomal RNAs at conserved 
sites in some eukaryotic microorganisms. Here, the myxomycete protists are a 
frequent source of nuclear group I introns due to their unique life strategy and 
a billion years of separate evolution. The ribosomal DNA of the myxomycete 
Mucilago crustacea was investigated and found to contain seven group I introns, 
including a direct repeat-containing intron at insertion site S1389 in the small 
subunit ribosomal RNA gene. We collected, analyzed, and compared 72 S1389 group 
IC1 introns representing diverse myxomycete taxa. The consensus secondary 
structure revealed a conserved ribozyme core, but with surprising sequence 
variations in the guanosine binding site in segment P7. Some S1389 introns 
harbored large extension sequences in the peripheral region of segment P9 
containing direct repeat arrays. These repeats contained up to 52 copies of a 
putative internal guide sequence motif. Other S1389 introns harbored homing 
endonuclease genes in segment P1 encoding His-Cys proteins. Homing endonuclease 
genes were further interrupted by small spliceosomal introns that have to be 
removed in order to generate the open reading frames. Phylogenetic analyses of 
S1389 intron and host gene indicated both vertical and horizontal intron 
transfer during evolution, and revealed sporadic appearances of direct repeats, 
homing endonuclease genes, and guanosine binding site variants among the 
myxomycete taxa.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased in the United Kingdom, and 
reliably measuring the impact on quality of life and the total healthcare cost 
from obesity is key to informing the cost-effectiveness of interventions that 
target obesity, and determining healthcare funding. Current methods for 
estimating cost-effectiveness of interventions for obesity may be subject to 
confounding and reverse causation. The aim of this study is to apply a new 
approach using mendelian randomisation for estimating the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions that target body mass index (BMI), which may be less affected by 
confounding and reverse causation than previous approaches.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated health-related quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and both primary and secondary healthcare costs for 310,913 men and 
women of white British ancestry aged between 39 and 72 years in UK Biobank 
between recruitment (2006 to 2010) and 31 March 2017. We then estimated the 
causal effect of differences in BMI on QALYs and total healthcare costs using 
mendelian randomisation. For this, we used instrumental variable regression with 
a polygenic risk score (PRS) for BMI, derived using a genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) of BMI, with age, sex, recruitment centre, and 40 genetic principal 
components as covariables to estimate the effect of a unit increase in BMI on 
QALYs and total healthcare costs. Finally, we used simulations to estimate the 
likely effect on BMI of policy relevant interventions for BMI, then used the 
mendelian randomisation estimates to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these 
interventions. A unit increase in BMI decreased QALYs by 0.65% of a QALY (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.49% to 0.81%) per year and increased annual total 
healthcare costs by £42.23 (95% CI: £32.95 to £51.51) per person. When 
considering only health conditions usually considered in previous 
cost-effectiveness modelling studies (cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes), we estimated that a unit increase 
in BMI decreased QALYs by only 0.16% of a QALY (95% CI: 0.10% to 0.22%) per 
year. We estimated that both laparoscopic bariatric surgery among individuals 
with BMI greater than 35 kg/m2, and restricting volume promotions for high fat, 
salt, and sugar products, would increase QALYs and decrease total healthcare 
costs, with net monetary benefits (at £20,000 per QALY) of £13,936 (95% CI: 
£8,112 to £20,658) per person over 20 years, and £546 million (95% CI: £435 
million to £671 million) in total per year, respectively. The main limitations 
of this approach are that mendelian randomisation relies on assumptions that 
cannot be proven, including the absence of directional pleiotropy, and that 
genotypes are independent of confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomisation can be used to estimate the impact of 
interventions on quality of life and healthcare costs. We observed that the 
effect of increasing BMI on health-related quality of life is much larger when 
accounting for 240 chronic health conditions, compared with only a limited 
selection. This means that previous cost-effectiveness studies have likely 
underestimated the effect of BMI on quality of life and, therefore, the 
potential cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce BMI.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the loss of years of healthy life due to road incidents of 
motorcyclists in the city of Medellin from 2012 to 2015.
METHODS: Descriptive study with data on health care of injured motorcyclists and 
deaths adjusted with the Preston and Coale method, and OPS proportional 
distribution for the period 2012-2015. The years of life lost due to premature 
death (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and the disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) were calculated according to the new methodology designed for 
that purpose.
RESULTS: The loss of years of healthy life due to road incidents of 
motorcyclists in the four-year period was 80,046 DALYs (823.8 per 100,000 
inhabitants), with a higher proportion in men (81.3% and a ratio of 5 to 1 
compared to women); the YLDs was 66.6% with marked differences in favor of men. 
There was nearly a 38% difference in the ages of 15 to 19 as well as a 19% 
difference from 30 to 49, compared to women. Premature death (YLLs) contributed 
to 33.4% of DALYs, with significant presentation in the above-mentioned age 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The greatest loss of years of healthy life due to road incidents of 
motorcyclists in Medellin was due to non-fatal injuries and was concentrated in 
young men. If the trend of motorcycle road incidents continues, both local and 
national road safety plans will fail to accomplish the expected results, 
especially among motorcycle users.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of technologies 
for treatment of varicose veins over 5 years-conservative care, surgery (high 
ligation and stripping), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), endovenous 
laser ablation (EVLA), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), mechanochemical 
ablation (MOCA), and cyanoacrylate glue occlusion (CAE).
METHODS: A systematic review was updated and used to construct a Markov decision 
model. Outcomes were reintervention on the truncal vein, retreatment of residual 
varicosities and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and costs over 5 years.
RESULTS: UGFS has a significantly greater reintervention rate than other 
procedures; there is no significant difference between the other procedures. The 
cost per QALY of EVLA vs UGFS in our base-case model is £16,966 ($23,700) per 
QALY, which is considered cost effective in the UK. RFA, MOCA, and CAE have 
greater procedure costs than EVLA with no evidence of greater benefit for 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: EVLA is the most cost-effective therapeutic option, with RFA a 
close second, in adult patients requiring treatment in the upper leg for 
incompetence of the GSV. MOCA, UGFS, CAE, conservative care, and high ligation 
and stripping are not cost effective at current prices in the UK National Health 
Service. MOCA and CAE seem to be promising, but further evidence on the 
effectiveness, reinterventions, and health-related quality of life is needed, as 
well as how cost effectiveness may vary across settings and reimbursement 
systems.

Neuromotor rehabilitation and recovery of upper limb functions are essential to 
improve the life quality of patients who have suffered injuries or have 
pathological sequels, where it is desirable to enhance the development of 
activities of daily living (ADLs). Modern approaches such as robotic-assisted 
rehabilitation provide decisive factors for effective motor recovery, such as 
objective assessment of the progress of the patient and the potential for the 
implementation of personalized training plans. This paper focuses on the design, 
development, and preliminary testing of a wearable robotic exoskeleton prototype 
with autonomous Artificial Intelligence-based control, processing, and safety 
algorithms that are fully embedded in the device. The proposed exoskeleton is a 
1-DoF system that allows flexion-extension at the elbow joint, where the chosen 
materials render it compact. Different operation modes are supported by a 
hierarchical control strategy, allowing operation in autonomous mode, remote 
control mode, or in a leader-follower mode. Laboratory tests validate the proper 
operation of the integrated technologies, highlighting a low latency and 
reasonable accuracy. The experimental result shows that the device can be 
suitable for use in providing support for diagnostic and rehabilitation 
processes of neuromotor functions, although optimizations and rigorous clinical 
validation are required beforehand.

In many countries, the number of elderly people has grown due to the increase in 
the life expectancy of the population, many of whom currently live alone and are 
prone to having accidents that they cannot report, especially if they are 
immobilized. For this reason, we have developed a non-intrusive IoT device, 
which, through multiple integrated sensors, collects information on habitual 
user behavior patterns and uses it to generate unusual behavior rules. These 
rules are used by our SecurHome system to send alert messages to the dependent 
person's family members or caregivers if their behavior changes abruptly over 
the course of their daily life. This document describes in detail the design and 
development of the SecurHome system.

Bone metastases and osteoid osteoma (OO) have a high incidence in patients 
facing primary lesions in many organs. Radiotherapy has long been the standard 
choice for these patients, performed as stand-alone or in conjunction with 
surgery. However, the needs of these patients have never been fully met, 
especially in the ones with low life expectancy, where treatments devoted to 
pain reduction are pivotal. New techniques as hyperthermia treatments (HTs) are 
emerging to reduce the associated pain of bone metastases and OO. Temperature 
monitoring during HTs may significantly improve the clinical outcomes since the 
amount of thermal injury depends on the tissue temperature and the exposure 
time. This is particularly relevant in bone tumors due to the adjacent 
vulnerable structures (e.g., spinal cord and nerve roots). In this Review, we 
focus on the potential of temperature monitoring on HT of bone cancer. 
Preclinical and clinical studies have been proposed and are underway to 
investigate the use of different thermometric techniques in this scenario. We 
review these studies, the principle of work of the thermometric techniques used 
in HTs, their strengths, weaknesses, and pitfalls, as well as the strategies and 
the potential of improving the HTs outcomes.

Physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, 
including the world's major non-communicable diseases, such as coronary heart 
disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, shortening life 
expectancy. There are minimal medical care and personal trainers' methods to 
monitor a patient's actual physical activity types. To improve activity 
monitoring, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach to classify 
physical movement activity patterns. In more detail, we employ two deep learning 
(DL) methods, namely a deep feed-forward neural network (DNN) and a deep 
recurrent neural network (RNN) for this purpose. We evaluate the two models on 
two physical movement datasets collected from several volunteers who carried 
tri-axial accelerometer sensors. The first dataset is from the UCI machine 
learning repository, which contains 14 different activities-of-daily-life (ADL) 
and is collected from 16 volunteers who carried a single wrist-worn tri-axial 
accelerometer. The second dataset includes ten other ADLs and is gathered from 
eight volunteers who placed the sensors on their hips. Our experiment results 
show that the RNN model provides accurate performance compared to the 
state-of-the-art methods in classifying the fundamental movement patterns with 
an overall accuracy of 84.89% and an overall F1-score of 82.56%. The results 
indicate that our method provides the medical doctors and trainers a promising 
way to track and understand a patient's physical activities precisely for better 
treatment.

Soil compaction management relies on costly annual deep tillage. Variable-depth 
tillage or site-specific tillage modifies the physical properties of the soil at 
the required zones for the growth of crops. In this study, a depth control 
system was designed for the subsoiler of the tillage at various depths. For this 
purpose, an algorithm was written to investigate the subsoiler location and soil 
compaction. A program was also developed to implement this algorithm using Kinco 
Builder Software to control the subsoiler depth, which was evaluated on the 
experimental platform. In this study, four compression sensors were used at a 
distance of 10 cm up to a depth of 40 cm on the blade mounted at the front of 
the tractor. The data of these sensors were used as the input and compared with 
the pressure baseline limit (2.07 MPa), and with the priority to select the 
greater depth, the depth of subsoiler was determined. At all three modes of 
sensor activation (single, collective, and combined), this system was able to 
operate the hydraulic system of the tractor and place the subsoiler at the 
desired depth through the use of the position sensors.

Understanding how species adapt to extreme environments is an extension of the 
main goals of evolutionary biology. While alpine plants are an ideal system for 
investigating the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation, genomic resources 
in these species are still limited. In the present study, we generated 
reference-level transcriptomic data of five Saussurea species through 
high-throughput sequencing and de novo assembly. Three of them are located in 
the highland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), and the other two are close 
relatives distributed in the lowland. A series of comparative and evolutionary 
genomics analyses were conducted to explore the genetic signatures of adaptive 
evolution to high-altitude environments. Estimation of divergence time using 
single-copy orthologs revealed that Saussurea species diversified during the 
Miocene, a period with extensive tectonic movement and climatic fluctuation on 
the QTP. We characterized gene families specific to the alpine species, 
including genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, pectin catabolic process, 
lipid transport, and polysaccharide metabolic process, which may play important 
roles in defense of hypoxia and freezing temperatures of the QTP. Furthermore, 
in a phylogenetic context with the branch model, we identified hundreds of genes 
with signatures of positive selection. These genes are involved in DNA repair, 
membrane transport, response to UV-B and hypoxia, and reproductive processes, as 
well as some metabolic processes associated with nutrient intake, potentially 
responsible for Saussurea adaptation to the harsh environments of high altitude. 
Overall, our study provides valuable genomic resources for alpine species and 
gained helpful insights into the genomic basis of plants adapting to extreme 
environments.

Cancer, which is a leading cause of death, contributes significantly to reducing 
life expectancy worldwide. Even though paclitaxel (PTX) is known as one of the 
main anticancer drugs, it has several limitations, including low solubility in 
aqueous solutions, a limited dosage range, an insufficient release amount, and 
patient resistance. To overcome these limitations, we suggest the development of 
PTX-loaded thermosponge nanoparticles (PTX@TNP), which result in improved 
anticancer effects, via a simple nanoprecipitation method, which allows the 
preparation of PTX@TNPs with hydrophobic interactions without any chemical 
conjugation. Further, to improve the drug content and yield of the prepared 
complex, the co-organic solvent ratio was optimized. Thus, it was observed that 
the drug release rate increased as the drug capacity of PTX@TNPs increased. 
Furthermore, increasing PTX loading led to considerable anticancer activity 
against multidrug resistance (MDR)-related colorectal cancer cells (HCT 15), 
implying a synergistic anticancer effect. These results suggest that the 
solubilization of high drug amounts and the controlled release of poorly 
water-soluble PTX using TNPs could significantly improve its anticancer therapy, 
particularly in the treatment of MDR-p-glycoprotein-overexpressing cancers.

Thermostable and Long-Circulating Albumin-Conjugated Arthrobacter globiformis 
Urate Oxidase.

Technology (GIST), Gwangju 61005, Korea.

Urate oxidase derived from Aspergillus flavus has been investigated as a 
treatment for tumor lysis syndrome, hyperuricemia, and gout. However, its 
long-term use is limited owing to potential immunogenicity, low thermostability, 
and short circulation time in vivo. Recently, urate oxidase isolated from 
Arthrobacter globiformis (AgUox) has been reported to be thermostable and less 
immunogenic than the Aspergillus-derived urate oxidase. Conjugation of human 
serum albumin (HSA) to therapeutic proteins has become a promising strategy to 
prolong circulation time in vivo. To develop a thermostable and long-circulating 
urate oxidase, we investigated the site-specific conjugation of HSA to AgUox 
based on site-specific incorporation of a clickable non-natural amino acid 
(frTet) and an inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction. We selected 14 
sites for frTet incorporation using the ROSETTA design, a computational 
stability prediction program, among which AgUox containing frTet at position 196 
(Ag12) exhibited enzymatic activity and thermostability comparable to those of 
wild-type AgUox. Furthermore, Ag12 exhibited a high HSA conjugation yield 
without compromising the enzymatic activity, generating well-defined 
HSA-conjugated AgUox (Ag12-HSA). In mice, the serum half-life of Ag12-HSA was 
approximately 29 h, which was roughly 17-fold longer than that of wild-type 
AgUox. Altogether, this novel formulated AgUox may hold enhanced therapeutic 
efficacy for several diseases.

Nanotechnology is a promising tool for the treatment of cancer. In the past 
decades, major steps have been made to bring nanotechnology into the clinic in 
the form of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. The great hope of drug 
delivery systems is to reduce the side effects of chemotherapeutics while 
simultaneously increasing the efficiency of the therapy. An increased treatment 
efficiency would greatly benefit the quality of life as well as the life 
expectancy of cancer patients. However, besides its many advantages, 
nanomedicines have to face several challenges and hurdles before they can be 
used for the effective treatment of tumors. Here, we give an overview of the 
hallmarks of cancer, especially colorectal cancer, and discuss biological 
barriers as well as how drug delivery systems can be utilized for the effective 
treatment of tumors and metastases.

INTRODUCTION: People living with HIV (PLWHIV) are at a higher risk of cancer 
compared to the general population. With improved cancer treatments and the 
increased life expectancy of PLWHIV, the incidence of second cancers is also 
expected to increase.
METHODS: We reviewed the cases of PLWHIV with cancer that have been presented to 
the CANCERVIH national multidisciplinary board since 2014. We included all cases 
with a history of cancer, and studied the incidence and types of second cancers.
RESULTS: In total, 719 cases were reviewed, out of which 94 (13%) had a history 
of at least one cancer. For the first primary cancers, 46 (49%) were 
AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) and 48 (51%) were non-AIDS-defining cancers 
(NADCs). Kaposi sarcoma (33%) and NHL (15%) occurred most frequently as first 
cancers. Among the first cancers that were ADCs, 15% of the second cancers were 
NHL, 11% anal canal cancers, 9% bladder and 9% Hodgkin lymphomas. Among the 
first cancers that were NADCs, 38% of the second cancers were lung cancers, 8% 
bladder, 8% head and neck and 8% NHL.
DISCUSSION: With the aging of PLWHIV, the incidence of second and subsequent 
cancers is expected to increase in this population. Immuno-virological control 
should be maintained. Increased surveillance, early prevention and screening 
programs should be offered to all PLWHIV, including those with an undetectable 
HIV viral load and/or immune restoration.

OBJECTIVES: People with mental disorders are more likely to smoke than the 
general population. The objective of this study is to develop a decision 
analytical model that estimates long-term cost-effectiveness of smoking 
cessation interventions in this population.
METHODS: A series of Markov models were constructed to estimate average lifetime 
smoking-attributable inpatient cost and expected quality-adjusted life-years. 
The model parameters were estimated using a variety of data sources. The model 
incorporated uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte 
Carlo simulations. It also generated tables presenting incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of the proposed interventions with varying incremental 
costs and incremental quit rates. We used data from 2 published trials to 
demonstrate the model's ability to make projections beyond the observational 
time frame.
RESULTS: The average smoker's smoking-attributable inpatient cost was 3 times 
higher and health utility was 5% lower than ex-smokers. The intervention in the 
trial with a statistically insignificant difference in quit rate (19% vs 25%; 
P=.2) showed a 45% to 49% chance of being cost-effective compared with the 
control at willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20 000 to £30 000/quality-adjusted 
life-years. The second trial had a significant outcome (quit rate 35.9% vs 
15.6%; P<.001), and the corresponding probability of the intervention being 
cost-effective was 65%.
CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a consistent platform for clinical trials to 
estimate the potential lifetime cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation 
interventions for people with mental disorders and could help commissioners 
direct resources to the most cost-effective programs. However, direct 
comparisons of results between trials must be interpreted with caution owing to 
their different designs and settings.

Prostate Cancer in Older Adults: Risk of Clinically Meaningful Disease, the Role 
of Screening and Special Considerations.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in 
the USA and several studies suggest more aggressive disease in older patients. 
However, screening remains controversial, especially in the older patient 
population.
RECENT FINDINGS: Aggressive prostate cancers are more common in older men. 
Screening trial results are conflicting but data suggest an improvement in 
prostate cancer mortality and increased detection of metastatic disease with 
screening. When PSA is utilized with multiparametric MRI and biomarker assays, 
patients at significant risk of clinically meaningful prostate cancer can be 
appropriately selected for biopsy. A thoughtful and individualized approach is 
central when considering prostate cancer screening in older men. This approach 
includes life expectancy estimation, use of appropriate geriatric assessment 
tools, use of multiparametric MRI and biomarkers in addition to PSA, and most 
importantly shared decision-making with patients.

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
other adverse health outcomes. In patients with pre-existing heart failure or 
coronary heart disease, obese individuals have a more favourable prognosis 
compared to individuals who are of normal weight. This paradoxical relationship 
between obesity and CVD has been termed the 'obesity paradox'. This phenomenon 
has also been observed in patients with other cardiovascular conditions and 
diseases of the respiratory and renal systems. Taking into consideration the 
well-established relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) and CVD, emerging 
evidence shows that overweight and obese individuals undergoing total hip or 
knee replacement for OA have lower mortality risk compared with normal weight 
individuals, suggesting an obesity paradox. Factors proposed to explain the 
obesity paradox include the role of cardiorespiratory fitness ("fat but fit"), 
the increased amount of lean mass in obese people, additional adipose tissue 
serving as a metabolic reserve, biases such as reverse causation and confounding 
by smoking, and the co-existence of older age and specific comorbidities such as 
CVD. A wealth of evidence suggests that higher levels of fitness are accompanied 
by prolonged life expectancy across all levels of adiposity and that the 
increased mortality risk attributed to obesity can be attenuated with increased 
fitness. For patients about to have joint replacement, improving fitness levels 
through physical activities or exercises that are attractive and feasible, 
should be a priority if intentional weight loss is unlikely to be achieved.
