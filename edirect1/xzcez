increased quality of life and life expectancy for those affected by this 
inherited hemorrhagic condition. Nowadays, individuals with hemophilia enjoy a 
life expectancy at birth close to that of males in the general population. As a 
consequence of the increasing age of the hemophilia population, a growing number 
of these patients develop age-related co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular 
disease and cancer, the management of which represents a new challenge for 
caregivers at hemophilia treatment centers. This narrative review focuses on the 
clinical problems arising in older people with hemophilia, with particular 
attention to the optimal therapeutic strategies.

PURPOSE: The present study evaluates the massive study of gene expression in 
metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC) patients using microarray gene expression 
profiling (MAGE) complemented with conventional sequencing, immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and fluorescent "in situ" hybridization (FISH), seeking to optimize the 
treatment in a subset of heavily pretreated patients and with limited life 
expectancy.
PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: MBC patients in hormone therapy progression with 
survival expectancy of at least 3 months (m) have been included. The MAGE 
contains gene probes representing genes known to potentially interact with 
available drugs as cited in the literature.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine procedures were performed from October 2010 to April 2016. 
Within the 30 evaluable procedures, considering all hormonal manipulations as a 
single line, the patients had received a median of 4 treatment lines prior to 
MAGE (range 1-7). Progression was observed in 6 cases, stable disease (SD) in 7 
cases and partial response (PR) in 16 cases, which implies a clinical benefit 
rate (SD + PR) of 76%. Actuarial median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 m 
(95% CI 2.5-9.5) in patients with clinical benefit. The median overall survival 
(OS) for the entire series was 11 m (95% CI 2.2-19.8).
CONCLUSION: Data presented here indicate that the use of MAGE provides relevant 
information to establish personalized treatment in frail patients with limited 
life expectancy in which therapeutic futility is a particularly difficult burden 
to assume.

Background and purpose - Osteoarthritis (OA) imposes a substantial burden on 
individuals and societies. We report on the burden of knee and hip OA in the 
Nordic region. Patients and methods - We used the findings from the 2015 Global 
Burden of Diseases Study to explore prevalence, years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of OA in the 6 Nordic 
countries during 1990-2015 (population of about 27 million in 2015). Results - 
During 1990-2015, the number of prevalent OA cases increased by 43% to 1,507,587 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1,454,338-1,564,778) in the region. OA accounted 
for 1.3% (UI 1.0-1.7) of YLDs in 1990, increasing to 1.6% (UI 1.2-2.0) in 2015. 
Of 315 causes studied, OA was the 15th leading cause of YLDs, causing 52,661 (UI 
34,056-77,499) YLDs in 2015; of these 23% were attributable to high body mass 
index. The highest relative importance of OA was reported for women aged 65-74 
years (8th leading cause of YLDs in 2015). Among the top 30 leading causes of 
YLDs in the region, OA had the 5th greatest relative increase in total YLDs 
during 1990-2015. From 1990 to 2015, increase in age-standardized YLDs from OA 
in the region was slightly lower than increase at the global level (7.5% vs. 
10.5%). OA was, however, responsible for a higher proportional burden of DALYs 
in the region compared with the global level. Interpretation - The OA burden is 
high and rising in the Nordic region. With population growth, aging, and the 
obesity epidemic, a substantial rise in the burden of OA is expected and should 
be addressed in health policies.

Objective This study introduces a treatment algorithm based on staging neck 
dissection to identify patients with palatine tonsil squamous cell carcinoma who 
can be effectively treated with single-modality transoral robotic surgery while 
maintaining quality of life. Study Design Retrospective case series. Setting 
Kaiser Permanente Southern California Medical Group from 2012 to 2017. Subjects 
and Methods Patients with early-stage (T1/2) palatine tonsil squamous cell 
carcinoma with clinically and radiographically N0 necks underwent staging neck 
dissection. Those with pN2/3 disease or extracapsular extension on final 
pathology were triaged to definitive chemoradiation treatment. Patients with 
confirmed pN0/1 necks without extracapsular extension were treated definitively 
with transoral robotic surgery. Results Nineteen patients with cN0 disease 
underwent selective neck dissection. All were p16 positive. Of these, 14 had 
pathologically confirmed N0/1 necks without extracapsular extension and were 
treated with primary surgical resection via transoral robotic surgery. Clear 
margins were obtained on all patients. There were no significant intra- or 
postoperative complications. No patients required gastrostomy tube or 
tracheostomy placement. Mean and median follow-up was 28 months with no 
recurrences to date. Conclusion Up-front staging neck dissection accurately 
triages low-risk patients, determining candidates for single-modality definitive 
treatment with transoral robotic surgery. This approach provides excellent 
survival outcomes and minimal morbidity and maintains quality of life among 
appropriately selected patients with palatine tonsil cancer.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the improvement in US life expectancy required to reach 
parity with high-resource nations by 2030, to document historical precedent of 
this rate, and to discuss the plausibility of achieving this rate in the United 
States.
METHODS: We performed a demographic analysis of secondary data in 5-year periods 
from 1985 to 2015.
RESULTS: To achieve the United Nations projected mortality estimates for Western 
Europe in 2030, the US life expectancy must grow at 0.32% a year between 2016 
and 2030. This rate has precedent, even in low-mortality populations. Over 204 
country-periods examined, nearly half exhibited life-expectancy growth greater 
than 0.32%. Of the 51 US states observed, 8.2% of state-periods demonstrated 
life-expectancy growth that exceeded the 0.32% target.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving necessary growth in life expectancy over the next 15 
years despite historical precedent will be challenging. Much all-cause mortality 
is structured decades earlier and, at present, older-age mortality reductions in 
the United States are decelerating. Addressing mortality decline at all ages 
will require enhanced political will and a strong commitment to equity 
improvement in the US population.

We define measures of effect used in public health evaluations, which include 
the risk difference and the risk ratio, the population-attributable risk, years 
of life lost or gained, disability-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted life 
years, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Except for the risk ratio, 
all of these are absolute effect measures. For constructing externally 
generalizable absolute measures of effect when there is superior fit of the 
multiplicative model, we suggest using the multiplicative model to estimate 
relative risks, which will often be obtained in simple linear form with no 
interactions, and then converting these to the desired absolute measure. The 
externally generalizable absolute measure of effect can be obtained by suitably 
standardizing to the risk factor distribution of the population to which the 
results are to be generalized. External generalizability will often be 
compromised when absolute measures are computed from study populations with risk 
factor distributions different from those of the population to whom the results 
are to be generalized, even when these risk factors are not confounders of the 
intervention effect.

BACKGROUND: The specificity of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) used for 
early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV infection is <100%, leading some 
HIV-uninfected infants to be incorrectly identified as HIV-infected. The World 
Health Organization recommends that infants undergo a second NAAT to confirm any 
positive test result, but implementation is limited. Our objective was to 
determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of confirmatory HIV testing for EID 
programmes in South Africa.
METHOD AND FINDINGS: Using the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS 
Complications (CEPAC)-Pediatric model, we simulated EID testing at age 6 weeks 
for HIV-exposed infants without and with confirmatory testing. We assumed a NAAT 
cost of US$25, NAAT specificity of 99.6%, NAAT sensitivity of 100% for infants 
infected in pregnancy or at least 4 weeks prior to testing, and a 
mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate at 12 months of 4.9%; we simulated 
guideline-concordant rates of testing uptake, result return, and antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) initiation (100%). After diagnosis, infants were linked to and 
retained in care for 10 years (false-positive) or lifelong (true-positive). All 
parameters were varied widely in sensitivity analyses. Outcomes included number 
of infants with false-positive diagnoses linked to ART per 1,000 ART 
initiations, life expectancy (LE, in years) and per-person lifetime HIV-related 
healthcare costs. Both without and with confirmatory testing, LE was 26.2 years 
for HIV-infected infants and 61.4 years for all HIV-exposed infants; clinical 
outcomes for truly infected infants did not differ by strategy. Without 
confirmatory testing, 128/1,000 ART initiations were false-positive diagnoses; 
with confirmatory testing, 1/1,000 ART initiations were false-positive 
diagnoses. Because confirmatory testing averted costly HIV care and ART in truly 
HIV-uninfected infants, it was cost-saving: total cost US$1,790/infant tested, 
compared to US$1,830/infant tested without confirmatory testing. Confirmatory 
testing remained cost-saving unless NAAT cost exceeded US$400 or the 
HIV-uninfected status of infants incorrectly identified as infected was 
ascertained and ART stopped within 3 months of starting. Limitations include 
uncertainty in the data used in the model, which we examined with sensitivity 
and uncertainty analyses. We also excluded clinical harms to HIV-uninfected 
infants incorrectly treated with ART after false-positive diagnosis (e.g., 
medication toxicities); including these outcomes would further increase the 
value of confirmatory testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Without confirmatory testing, in settings with MTCT rates similar 
to that of South Africa, more than 10% of infants who initiate ART may reflect 
false-positive diagnoses. Confirmatory testing prevents inappropriate HIV 
diagnosis, is cost-saving, and should be adopted in all EID programmes.

Individualized Glycemic Goals and an Expanded Classification of Severe 
Hypoglycemia in Diabetes.

Cryer PE(1).

University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO pcryer@wustl.edu.

The view that a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) level <7% (55 mmol/mol) is the accepted 
glycemic goal for most people with diabetes sometimes conflicts with the view 
that glycemic goals should be individualized and, thus, that somewhat higher A1C 
levels are appropriate for some, particularly many at risk for iatrogenic 
hypoglycemia because of treatment with insulin, a sulfonylurea, or a glinide. 
The relationship between A1C and chronic complications of diabetes is 
curvilinear, A1C is a relatively weak predictor of cardiovascular disease, and 
minor elevations of A1C above 7% have not been found to be associated with 
increased mortality. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia causes recurrent morbidity in 
diabetes and is sometimes fatal. In those at risk for hypoglycemia, a reasonable 
individualized glycemic goal is the lowest A1C that does not cause severe 
hypoglycemia and preserves awareness of hypoglycemia, preferably with little or 
no symptomatic or even asymptomatic hypoglycemia, at a given stage in the 
evolution of the individual's diabetes. A somewhat higher A1C level is 
appropriate in those who have previously experienced hypoglycemia or have 
potential high risk for hypoglycemia, have a long duration of diabetes, and have 
a short life expectancy, among other traits. Given the importance of severe 
hypoglycemia in selecting glycemic goals, it is proposed to expand the 
classification of severe hypoglycemia beyond a hypoglycemic event requiring 
assistance from another person to include a measured glucose concentration <50 
mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L), a level associated with sudden death.

Translation initiation generally occurs at AUG codons in eukaryotes, although it 
has been shown that non-AUG or noncanonical translation initiation can also 
occur. However, the evidence for noncanonical translation initiation sites 
(TISs) is largely indirect and based on ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) studies. 
Here, using a strategy specifically designed to enrich N termini of proteins, we 
demonstrate that many human proteins are translated at noncanonical TISs. The 
large majority of TISs that mapped to 5' untranslated regions were noncanonical 
and led to N-terminal extension of annotated proteins or translation of upstream 
small open reading frames (uORF). It has been controversial whether the amino 
acid corresponding to the start codon is incorporated at the TIS or methionine 
is still incorporated. We found that methionine was incorporated at almost all 
noncanonical TISs identified in this study. Comparison of the TISs determined 
through mass spectrometry with ribosome profiling data revealed that about 
two-thirds of the novel annotations were indeed supported by the available 
ribosome profiling data. Sequence conservation across species and a higher 
abundance of noncanonical TISs than canonical ones in some cases suggests that 
the noncanonical TISs can have biological functions. Overall, this study 
provides evidence of protein translation initiation at noncanonical TISs and 
argues that further studies are required for elucidation of functional 
implications of such noncanonical translation initiation.

The way teeth grow is recorded in dental enamel as incremental marks. Detailed 
analysis of tooth growth is known to provide valuable insights into the growth 
and the pace of life of vertebrates. Here, we study the growth pattern of the 
first lower molar in several extant and extinct species of Equus and explore its 
relationship with life history events. Our histological analysis shows that 
enamel extends beyond the molar's cervix in these mammals. We identified three 
different crown developmental stages (CDS) in the first lower molars of equids 
characterised by different growth rates and likely to be related to structural 
and ontogenetic modifications of the tooth. Enamel extension rate, which ranges 
from ≈400 μm/d at the beginning of crown development to rates of ≈30 μm/d near 
the root, and daily secretion rate (≈17 μm/d) have been shown to be very 
conservative within the genus. From our results, we also inferred data of molar 
wear rate for these equids that suggest higher wear rates at early ontogenetic 
stages (13 mm/y) than commonly assumed. The results obtained here provide a 
basis for future studies of equid dentition in different scientific areas, 
involving isotope, demographic and dietary studies.

Muscle weakness-which can result from neurological injuries, genetic disorders, 
or typical aging-can affect a person's mobility and quality of life. For many 
people with muscle weakness, assistive devices provide the means to regain 
mobility and independence. These devices range from well-established technology, 
such as wheelchairs, to newer technologies, such as exoskeletons and exosuits. 
For assistive devices to be used in everyday life, they must provide assistance 
across activities of daily living (ADLs) in an unobtrusive manner. This article 
introduces the Myosuit, a soft, wearable device designed to provide continuous 
assistance at the hip and knee joint when working with and against gravity in 
ADLs. This robotic device combines active and passive elements with a 
closed-loop force controller designed to behave like an external muscle 
(exomuscle) and deliver gravity compensation to the user. At 4.1 kg (4.6 kg with 
batteries), the Myosuit is one of the lightest untethered devices capable of 
delivering gravity support to the user's knee and hip joints. This article 
presents the design and control principles of the Myosuit. It describes the 
textile interface, tendon actuators, and a bi-articular, synergy-based approach 
for continuous assistance. The assistive controller, based on bi-articular force 
assistance, was tested with a single subject who performed sitting transfers, 
one of the most gravity-intensive ADLs. The results show that the control 
concept can successfully identify changes in the posture and assist hip and knee 
extension with up to 26% of the natural knee moment and up to 35% of the knee 
power. We conclude that the Myosuit's novel approach to assistance using a 
bi-articular architecture, in combination with the posture-based force 
controller, can effectively assist its users in gravity-intensive ADLs, such as 
sitting transfers.

Human life expectancy is rapidly increasing with an associated increasing burden 
of chronic diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, 
there is limited progress in finding effective treatment for these conditions. 
For this reason, members of the genus Streptomyces have been explored 
extensively over the past decades as these filamentous bacteria are highly 
efficient in producing bioactive compounds with human health benefits. Being 
ubiquitous in nature, streptomycetes can be found in both terrestrial and marine 
environments. Previously, two Streptomyces strains (MUSC 137T and MUM 256) 
isolated from mangrove sediments in Peninsular Malaysia demonstrated potent 
antioxidant and cytotoxic activities against several human cancer cell lines on 
bioactivity screening. These results illustrate the importance of streptomycetes 
from underexplored regions aside from the terrestrial ecosystem. Here we provide 
the insights and significance of Streptomyces species in the search of 
anticancer and/or chemopreventive agents and highlight the impact of next 
generation sequencing on drug discovery from the Streptomyces arsenal.

Drug Hypersensitivity and Anaphylaxis in Cancer and Chronic Inflammatory 
Diseases: The Role of Desensitizations.

Boston, MA, United States.

Drug allergy is a rising problem in the twenty-first century which affects all 
populations and races, children, and adults, and for which the recognition, 
diagnosis, management, and treatment is still not well standardized. Classical 
and new chemotherapy drugs, monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), and small molecules 
to treat cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases are aimed at improving quality 
of life and life expectancy of patients, but an increasing number of reactions 
including anaphylaxis precludes their use in targeted populations. Women are 
more affected by drug allergy and up to 27% of women with ovarian and breast 
cancer develop carboplatin allergy after multiple cycles of treatment. Carriers 
of BRCA genes develop drug allergy after fewer exposures and can present with 
severe reactions, including anaphylaxis. Atopic patients are at increased risk 
for chemotherapy and MoAbs drug allergy and the current patterns of treatment 
with recurrent and intermittent drug exposures may favor the development of drug 
allergies. To overcome drug allergy, desensitization has been developed, a novel 
approach which provides a unique opportunity to protect against anaphylaxis and 
to improve clinical outcomes. There is evidence that inhibitory mechanisms 
blocking IgE/antigen mast cell activation are active during desensitization, 
enhancing safety. Whether desensitization modulates drug allergic and 
anaphylactic responses facilitating tolerance is currently being investigated. 
This review provides insight into the current knowledge of drug allergy and 
anaphylaxis to cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases drugs, the mechanisms of 
drug desensitization and its applications to personalized medicine.

5-Formylcytosine (5fC), which plays an important role in epigenetic functions, 
has received widespread attention in many related fields. Here, we demonstrate a 
new design for both the fluorogenic switch-on detection and single-base 
resolution analysis of 5fC through selectively reacting a reagent with 5fC to 
yield an intramolecular cyclization nucleobase. The generated product, bearing a 
similar benzothiazole-iminocoumarin scaffold, is highly fluorescent and enables 
us to qualitatively and quantitatively detect 5fC moieties in γ-irradiated calf 
thymus DNA. Additionally, losing the exocyclic 4-amino group in 5fC causes the 
incorporation of dATP through base pairing with the generated nucleobase during 
polymerase extension, which helped us to analyze the 5fC sites in both single- 
and double-stranded oligonucleotides. Our Sanger and Illumina sequencing results 
show great potential in single-base resolution analysis of 5fC. It is hopeful 
that a similar design may be used for more detection targets.

OBJECTIVES: Non-invasive ventilation treatment for patients with acute 
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is well documented. 
Communication with patients during treatment is inhibited because of the mask, 
the noise from the machine and patient distress. Assessing life expectancy and 
identifying end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease posed difficulties 
and caused doubts concerning initiation and continuation of non-invasive 
ventilation as life-sustaining treatment. Health professionals expressed a need 
for knowledge of patients' perspectives and attitude towards non-invasive 
ventilation.
METHODS: The study adheres to principles of Critical psychological practice 
research. Data on patients' and health professionals' perspectives were obtained 
from observations from the ward and semi-structured interviews with 16 patients. 
A group of health professionals was set up to form a co-researcher group. The 
co-researcher group described and analysed treatment practice at the department, 
drawing on research literature, results from observations and patients' 
interviews.
RESULTS: Interviews revealed that 15 patients evaluated treatment with 
non-invasive ventilation positively, although 13 had experienced fear and 14 
discomfort during treatment. The co-researcher group described health 
professionals' perspectives and analysed treatment practice based on data from 
patients' perspectives developing new management strategies in clinical practice 
with non-invasive ventilation.
CONCLUSION: The participatory approach enabled continuous and complementary 
development of knowledge and treatment practice. The investigation of patient 
perspectives was particularly productive in qualifying cooperation among health 
professionals. The study resulted in preparing, and implementing, new clinical 
strategies.

Pregnancy associated death in record linkage studies relative to delivery, 
termination of pregnancy, and natural losses: A systematic review with a 
narrative synthesis and meta-analysis.

North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Measures of pregnancy associated deaths provide important guidance 
for public health initiatives. Record linkage studies have significantly 
improved identification of deaths associated with childbirth but relatively few 
have also examined deaths associated with pregnancy loss even though higher 
rates of maternal death have been associated with the latter. Following PRISMA 
guidelines we undertook a systematic review of record linkage studies examining 
the relative mortality risks associated with pregnancy loss to develop a 
narrative synthesis, a meta-analysis, and to identify research opportunities.
METHODS: MEDLINE and SCOPUS were searched in July 2015 using combinations of: 
mortality, maternal death, record linkage, linked records, pregnancy associated 
mortality, and pregnancy associated death to identify papers using linkage of 
death certificates to independent records identifying pregnancy outcomes. 
Additional studies were identified by examining all citations for relevant 
studies.
RESULTS: Of 989 studies, 11 studies from three countries reported mortality 
rates associated with termination of pregnancy, miscarriage or failed pregnancy. 
Within a year of their pregnancy outcomes, women experiencing a pregnancy loss 
are over twice as likely to die compared to women giving birth. The heightened 
risk is apparent within 180 days and remains elevated for many years. There is a 
dose effect, with exposure to each pregnancy loss associated with increasing 
risk of death. Higher rates of death from suicide, accidents, homicide and some 
natural causes, such as circulatory diseases, may be from elevated stress and 
risk taking behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Both miscarriage and termination of pregnancy are markers for 
reduced life expectancy. This association should inform research and new public 
health initiatives including screening and interventions for patients exhibiting 
known risk factors.

The number of people living with disabilities worldwide is rapidly growing due 
to a longer life expectancy and the subsequent increasing burden of chronic 
diseases. The need of developing and implementing effective strategies aimed at 
delaying or preventing disability has been repeatedly underlined and is 
currently the main focus of several health-care policies. In this scenario, a 
special attention is addressed to the identification of specific clinical 
conditions measuring the risk profile of the individual of developing an overt 
disability and other negative outcomes. These risk profiles can indeed become 
promising targets for developing and implementing preventive interventions. When 
the disabling cascade is fully established, in fact, the reversing/attenuating 
the process becomes more challenging. However, the exact nature of these 
relatively new constructs is not yet sufficiently clear, and several related 
issues remain poorly explored. In particular, these entities tend to be 
considered as unequivocally prodromal stages of a future disease, neglecting and 
underestimating their fluctuations/transitions over time and their potential to 
clinically improve/revert. This unbalanced judgment did probably contribute to 
an ambiguous and biased use of these conditions. Considering them as an early 
stage of an unavoidable future disease, in fact, determined a tendency to start 
a targeted intervention as if in presence of the disease itself, with the 
subsequent risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. In the present article, we 
discuss the dynamics underlying the reversion from a clinical at-risk condition 
to normality and its implications, specifically focusing on the examples of 
frailty and mild cognitive impairment.

The second-to-fourth finger length ratio (2D:4D) is an indication of prenatal 
sex hormone exposure, and has sex-specifically been associated with several 
lethal illnesses including ischemic heart disease, diverse cancers, and suicide. 
Our primary aim was to verify that 2D:4D sex-specifically relates to life 
expectancy and suicide numbers on a national level (23 countries). We also used 
a hypothesis-free approach to investigate associations with other causes of 
death [p value adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing using the false 
discovery rate procedure (FDR)]. All parameters were normalized to the national 
mean (of males and females) and analyzed across nations. Normalized male 2D:4D 
correlated positively with normalized male life expectancy (at birth, r = 0.46, 
p = 0.029; at the age of 60, r = 0.44, p = 0.038) and negatively with normalized 
male suicide rates (r = - 0.49, p = 0.017). In the exploratory analyses, the 
normalized male 2D:4D values were negatively associated with the normalized male 
deaths rates from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions 
[r = - 0.65, p(FDR) = 0.011], respiratory infections [r = - 0.69, 
p(FDR) = 0.008], asthma [r = - 0.65, p(FDR) = 0.011], neurological conditions 
[r = - 0.56, p(FDR) = 0.046], and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias 
[r = - 0.59, p(FDR) = 0.036]. The normalized female parameters showed the same 
cross-national correlations. In line with the previous individual level 
findings, the results suggest that prenatal sex hormone effects are 
sex-specifically involved in suicide and neurological conditions. Moreover, we 
provide novel national level evidence that prenatal sex hormone priming may 
sex-specifically influence life expectancy and death risk from respiratory 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials and observational studies lacking measures of 
health-related quality of life (QoL) are often inapplicable when conducting 
cost-effectiveness analyses using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The only 
solution is to map QoL ex post from additionally collected clinical outcomes and 
generic QoL instruments. Nonetheless, mapping studies are absent in psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA).
METHODS: In this 2-year, prospective, multicentre, non-interventional study of 
PsA patients, EQ-5D and key clinical parameters such as Disease Activity in PsA 
(DAPsA), clinical DAPsA (cDAPsA; DAPsA without C-reactive protein [CRP]), and 
Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) were collected. We 
employed a linear mixed-effect regression model (ME) of the longitudinal dataset 
to explore the best predictors of QoL.
RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were followed over 873 
appointments/observations. DAPsA, cDAPsA and HAQ were stable and highly 
significant predictors of EQ-5D utilities in both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal analyses. The best prediction was provided using a linear ME with 
HAQ and cDAPsA or DAPsA. A HAQ increase of 1 point represented a decrease in 
EQ-5D by -0.204 or -0.203 (p < 0.0001); a one-point increase in cDAPsA or DAPsA 
dropped EQ-5D equally by -0.005 (p < 0.0001). The ME revealed steeper and more 
accurate association compared with cross-sectional regressions or non-linear 
models/transformations.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first mapping study conducted in PsA and we hope that 
our study will encourage further mapping studies in PsA. The results showed that 
in cases where CRP is absent, cDAPsA provides similar results to DAPsA in 
predicting QoL.

Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) are proteins that activate Rho 
GTPases in response to extracellular stimuli and regulate various biologic 
processes. ARHGEF19, one of RhoGEFs, was reported to activate RhoA in the 
Wnt-PCP pathway controlling convergent extension in Xenopus gastrulation. The 
goal of our study was to identify the role and molecular mechanisms of ARHGEF19 
in the tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ARHGEF19 expression 
was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues, and ARHGEF19 levels were 
significantly associated with lymph node status, distant metastasis and TNM 
stage; Patients with high ARHGEF19 levels had poor overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS). Our investigations revealed that ARHGEF19 
overexpression promoted the cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis of lung 
cancer cells, whereas knockdown of this gene inhibited these processes. 
Mechanistically, ARHGEF19 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway in a RhoA-independent manner: ARHGEF19 interacted with BRAF and 
facilitated the phosphorylation of its downstream kinase MEK1/2; both the Dbl 
homology (DH) and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of ARHGEF19 were 
indispensable for the phosphorylation of MEK1/2. Furthermore, downregulation of 
miR-29b was likely responsible for the increased expression of ARHGEF19 in lung 
cancer tissues and, consequently, the abnormal activation of MAPK signaling. 
These findings suggest that ARHGEF19 upregulation, due to the low expression of 
miR-29 in NSCLC tissues, may play a crucial role in NSCLC tumorigenesis by 
activating MAPK signaling. ARHGEF19 could serve as a negative prognostic marker 
as well as a therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.

Aging is now at the forefront of major challenges faced globally, creating an 
immediate need for safe, widescale interventions to reduce the burden of chronic 
disease and extend human healthspan. Metformin and rapamycin are two 
FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors proposed for this purpose, exhibiting significant 
anti-cancer and anti-aging properties beyond their current clinical 
applications. However, each faces issues with approval for off-label, 
prophylactic use due to adverse effects. Here, we initiate an effort to identify 
nutraceuticals-safer, naturally-occurring compounds-that mimic the anti-aging 
effects of metformin and rapamycin without adverse effects. We applied several 
bioinformatic approaches and deep learning methods to the Library of Integrated 
Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) dataset to map the gene- and 
pathway-level signatures of metformin and rapamycin and screen for matches among 
over 800 natural compounds. We then predicted the safety of each compound with 
an ensemble of deep neural network classifiers. The analysis revealed many novel 
candidate metformin and rapamycin mimetics, including allantoin and ginsenoside 
(metformin), epigallocatechin gallate and isoliquiritigenin (rapamycin), and 
withaferin A (both). Four relatively unexplored compounds also scored well with 
rapamycin. This work revealed promising candidates for future experimental
