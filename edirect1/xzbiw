socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Study topics include: the physical, 
social and emotional well-being of children and their caregivers; language; 
culture; parenting; and early childhood education.LSIC is a shared resource, 
formed in partnership with communities; its data are readily accessible through 
the Australian Government Department of Social Services (see 
http://dss.gov.au/lsic for data and access arrangements). As one of very few 
longitudinal studies of Indigenous children, and the only national one, LSIC 
will enable an understanding of Indigenous children from a wide range of 
environments and cultures. Findings from LSIC form part of a growing 
infrastructure from which to understand Indigenous child health.

Premature mortality is a public health concern that can be quantified as years 
of potential life lost (YPLL). Studying premature mortality can help guide 
hospital initiatives and resource allocation. We investigated the categories of 
neurologic and neurosurgical conditions associated with in-hospital deaths that 
account for the highest YPLL and their trends over time. Using the Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (NIS), we calculated YPLL for patients hospitalized in the USA 
from 1988 to 2011. Hospitalizations were categorized by related neurologic 
principal diagnoses. An estimated 2,355,673 in-hospital deaths accounted for an 
estimated 25,598,566 YPLL. The traumatic brain injury (TBI) category accounted 
for the highest annual mean YPLL at 361,748 (33.9% of total neurologic YPLL). 
Intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and anoxic 
brain damage completed the group of five diagnoses with the highest YPLL. TBI 
accounted for 12.1% of all inflation adjusted neurologic hospital charges and 
22.4% of inflation adjusted charges among neurologic deaths. The in-hospital 
mortality rate has been stable or decreasing for all of these diagnoses except 
TBI, which rose from 5.1% in 1988 to 7.8% in 2011. Using YPLL, we provide a 
framework to compare the burden of premature in-hospital mortality on patients 
with neurologic disorders, which may prove useful for informing decisions 
related to allocation of health resources or research funding. Considering 
premature mortality alone, increased efforts should be focused on TBI, 
particularly in and related to the hospital setting.

Rationale, design and methods of the Study of Work and Pain (SWAP): a cluster 
randomised controlled trial testing the addition of a vocational advice service 
to best current primary care for patients with musculoskeletal pain (ISRCTN 
52269669).

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain is a major contributor to short and long term 
work absence. Patients seek care from their general practitioner (GP) and yet 
GPs often feel ill-equipped to deal with work issues. Providing a vocational 
case management service in primary care, to support patients with 
musculoskeletal problems to remain at or return to work, is one potential 
solution but requires robust evaluation to test clinical and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol describes a cluster randomised controlled trial, 
with linked qualitative interviews, to investigate the effect of introducing a 
vocational advice service into general practice, to provide a structured 
approach to managing work related issues in primary care patients with 
musculoskeletal pain who are absent from work or struggling to remain in work. 
General practices (n = 6) will be randomised to offer best current care or best 
current care plus a vocational advice service. Adults of working age who are 
absent from or struggling to remain in work due to a musculoskeletal pain 
problem will be invited to participate and 330 participants will be recruited. 
Data collection will be through patient completed questionnaires at baseline, 4 
and 12 months. The primary outcome is self-reported work absence at 4 months. 
Incremental cost-utility analysis will be undertaken to calculate the cost per 
additional QALY gained and incremental net benefits. A linked interview study 
will explore the experiences of the vocational advice service from the 
perspectives of GPs, nurse practitioners (NPs), patients and vocational 
advisors.
DISCUSSION: This paper presents the rationale, design, and methods of the Study 
of Work And Pain (SWAP) trial. The results of this trial will provide evidence 
to inform primary care practice and guide the development of services to provide 
support for musculoskeletal pain patients with work-related issues.

BACKGROUND: Traditionally, conservative treatment of thoracolumbar (TL) burst 
fractures without neurologic deficit has encompassed the application of an 
extension brace. However, their effectiveness on maintaining the alignment, 
preventing posttraumatic deformities, and improving back pain, disability and 
quality of life is doubtful.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify and summarize the evidence from 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether bracing patients who 
suffer TL fractures adds benefices to the conservative manage without bracing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven databases were searched for relevant RCTs that 
compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of orthosis versus no-orthosis 
for TL burst fractures managed conservatively. Primary outcomes were: (1) Loss 
of kyphotic angle; (2) failure of conservative management requiring subsequent 
surgery; and (3) disability and pain outcomes. Secondary outcomes were defined 
by health-related quality of life and in-hospital stay.
RESULTS: Based on predefined inclusion criteria, only two eligible high-quality 
RCTs with a total of 119 patients were included. No significant difference was 
identified between the two groups regarding loss of kyphotic angle, pain 
outcome, or in-hospital stay. The pooled data showed higher scores in physical 
and mental domains of the Short-Form Health Survey 36 in the group treated 
without orthosis.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The current evidence suggests that orthosis could 
not be necessary when TL burst fractures without neurologic deficit are treated 
conservatively. However, due to limitations related with number and size of the 
included studies, more RCTs with high quality are desirable for making 
recommendations with more certainty.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nodules (PNs) are often detected incidentally during 
coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography, which is increasingly being used 
to evaluate patients with chest pain symptoms. However, the efficiency of 
following up on incidentally detected PN is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined demographic and clinical characteristics of 
stable symptomatic patients referred for coronary CT angiography in whom 
incidentally detected PNs warranted follow-up. A validated lung cancer 
simulation model was populated with data from these patients, and clinical and 
economic consequences of follow-up per Fleischner guidelines versus no follow-up 
were simulated. Of the 3665 patients referred for coronary CT angiography, 591 
(16%) had PNs requiring follow-up. The mean age of patients with PNs was 59±10 
years; 66% were male; 67% had ever smoked; and 21% had obstructive coronary 
artery disease. The projected overall lung cancer incidence was 5.8% in these 
patients, but the majority died of coronary artery disease (38%) and other 
causes (57%). Follow-up of PNs was associated with a 4.6% relative reduction in 
cumulative lung cancer mortality (absolute mortality: follow-up, 4.33% versus 
non-follow-up, 4.54%), more downstream testing (follow-up, 2.34 CTs per patient 
versus non-follow-up, 1.01 CTs per patient), and an average increase in 
quality-adjusted life of 7 days. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained 
were $154 700 to follow up the entire cohort and $129 800 per quality-adjusted 
life-year when only smokers were included.
CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up of PNs incidentally detected in patients undergoing 
coronary CT angiography for chest pain evaluation is associated with a small 
reduction in lung cancer mortality. However, significant downstream testing 
contributes to limited efficiency, as demonstrated by a high cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year, especially in nonsmokers.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early 
Detection Program (NBCCEDP) on cervical cancer screening for participating 
uninsured low-income women have never been measured.
PURPOSE: To estimate the benefits in life-years (LYs) gained; quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained; and deaths averted.
METHODS: A cervical cancer simulation model was constructed based on an existing 
cohort model. The model was applied to NBCCEDP participants aged 18-64 years. 
Screening habits for uninsured low-income women were estimated using National 
Health Interview Survey data from 1990 to 2005 and NBCCEDP data from 1991 to 
2007. The study was conducted during 2011-2012 and covered all 68 NBCCEDP 
grantees in 50 states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and 12 
tribal organizations. Separate simulations were performed for the following 
three scenarios: (1) women who received NBCCEDP (Program) screening; (2) women 
who received screening without the program (No Program); and (3) women who 
received no screening (No Screening).
RESULTS: Among 1.8 million women screened in 1991-2007, the Program added 10,369 
LYs gained compared to No Program, and 101,509 LYs gained compared to No 
Screening. The Program prevented 325 women from dying of cervical cancer 
relative to No Program, and 3,829 relative to No Screening. During this time 
period, the Program accounted for 15,589 QALYs gained when compared with No 
Program, and 121,529 QALYs gained when compared with No Screening.
CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest that NBCCEDP cervical cancer screening has 
reduced mortality among medically underserved low-income women who participated 
in the program.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are leading causes of mortality and 
morbidity among Indigenous people in New Zealand, Australia and Canada and are a 
major driver of the inequities in life expectancy between Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous people in these countries. Evidence-based pharmaceutical 
management of CVD can significantly reduce mortality and morbidity for persons 
diagnosed with CVD or for those at intermediate or high risk of CVD. Health 
literacy has been identified as a major barrier in the communication and 
implementation of appropriate pharmaceutical management plans for CVD. 
Addressing health literacy is particularly relevant in Indigenous populations 
where there are unique health and adult literacy challenges.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study will examine the effect of a customized, structured 
CVD medication programme, delivered by health professionals, on the health 
literacy of Indigenous people with, or at risk, of CVD. Primary outcomes are 
patient's knowledge about CVD medications; secondary outcomes examine changes in 
health literacy skills and practices. The study will employ a multi-site 
pre-post design with multiple measurement points to assess intervention 
efficacy. Participants will be recruited from four Indigenous primary care 
services in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Three educational sessions will 
be delivered over four weeks. A tablet application will support the education 
sessions and produce a customized pill card for each participant. Participants 
will be provided with written information about CVD medications. Medication 
knowledge scores, and specific health literacy skills and practices will be 
assessed before and after the three sessions. Statistical analyses will identify 
significant changes in outcomes over each session, and from the pre-session one 
to post-session three time points.
DISCUSSION: This study will make an important contribution to understanding the 
effect of a structured primary care-based intervention on CVD health literacy in 
Indigenous populations. The study also illustrates the incorporation of 
Indigenous health research principles and processes in clinical trials and 
provides insights that may be useful in other contexts.

With the incidence of liver disease increasing worldwide, a growing number of 
patients are being referred for assessment for liver transplant (LT). 
Unfortunately, the donor pool is not expanding at the same rate, which 
consequentially results in increasing demand on a finite resource. It is 
therefore imperative that the candidate who undergoes an LT gets maximal benefit 
with a resultant maximal increase in life expectancy. This article addresses 
some of the main cardiac and pulmonary issues that may occur in LT assessment 
candidates.

Peritoneal dialysis and in-centre haemodialysis: a cost-utility analysis from a 
UK payer perspective.

BACKGROUND: With limited healthcare resources available, cost-effective 
provision of dialysis to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 
important.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of varying levels of peritoneal 
dialysis (PD) use versus current practice among incident ESRD patients requiring 
dialysis.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
increasing uptake of PD to 39 and 50 % versus current practice of 22 % PD from a 
UK National Health Service perspective for the year of 2013-2014. A scenario 
with 5 % PD was also considered. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Five- and 10-year discounted total costs and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) per patient for the current scenario (22 % PD) were £96,307 and 
2.104, and £133,339 and 3.301, respectively. Use of PD in 39 % of patients 
resulted in 5- and 10-year total per-patient cost savings of £3,180 and £4,102 
versus current usage alongside total per-patient QALY increases of 0.017 and 
0.020. Use of PD in 50 % of patients resulted in 5- and 10-year per-patient cost 
savings of £5,238 and £6,758 versus current usage alongside per-patient QALY 
increases of 0.029 and 0.033. Thus, increasing use of PD was associated with 
marginally better outcomes and lower costs. Cost savings were driven by lower 
treatment costs and reduced transport requirements for PD versus haemodialysis. 
Reducing PD use was associated with higher costs and a small reduction in QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest increasing PD use among incident dialysis 
patients would be cost-effective, associated with reduced costs and potential 
modest improvements in quality of life.

Increasing longevity has been hailed as a triumph of medicine in recent years. 
With increasing life expectancy all over the world, ageing has been seen to 
outpace social and economic development in many countries. Declining mortality 
rates and total fertility rates result in an increase in the proportion of 
elderly individuals. The impact of the ageing population is felt less in the 
developed world, and it has been estimated that by the year 2050 over 80% of the 
elderly world population would be living in the developing world. Despite a 
higher life expectancy in developing nations, there has also been an increase in 
the risk of having chronic ailments during the increased years; a reflection of 
life-long accumulation of risk factors.1.

The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients on maintenance 
hemodialysis (MHD) is relatively higher than those without MHD. Chronic HCV 
infection detrimentally affects the life quality and expectancy, leads to renal 
transplant rejection, and increases the mortality of MHD patients. With the 
application of erythropoietin to improve uremic anemia and avoid blood 
transfusion, the new HCV infections during MHD in recent years are mainly caused 
by the lack of stringent universal precautions. Strict implementation of 
universal precautions for HCV transmission has led to markedly decreased HCV 
infections in many hemodialysis units, but physicians still should be alert for 
the anti-HCV negative HCV infection and occult HCV infection in MHD patients. 
Standard interferon alpha and pegylated interferon alpha monotherapies at a 
reduced dose are currently the main treatment strategies for MHD patients with 
active HCV replication, but how to increase the sustained virological response 
and decrease the side effects is the key problem. IFNα-free treatments with two 
or three direct-acting antivirals without ribavirin in MHD patients are waiting 
for future investigations.

In 2008, 563,294,000 people were living in Latin America (LA), of which 6.6% 
were older than 65. The region is going through a fast demographic and 
epidemiologic transition process, in the context of an improvement in 
socio-economic indices. The Latin American Dialysis and Renal Transplant 
Registry has collected data since 1991, through an annual survey completed by 20 
affiliated National Societies. Renal replacement treatment (RRT) prevalence and 
incidence showed an increase year by year. The prevalence rate (in all 
modalities) correlated with the World Bank country classification by income and 
the epidemiologic transition stage the countries were experiencing. RRT 
prevalence and kidney transplantation rates correlated significantly with gross 
national income (GNI), health expenditure in constant dollars (HeExp), % older 
than 65, life expectancy at birth, and % of the population living in urban 
settings. Kidney transplantation increased also, year by year, with more than 
50% of transplants performed using kidneys from deceased donors. Double 
transplants were performed in six countries. RRT prevalence and incidence 
increased in LA, and are associated with indexes reflecting higher and more 
evenly distributed national wealth (GNI and HeExp), and the stage of demographic 
and epidemiological transition.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether conservative or surgical therapy is 
more cost effective for the initial treatment of stress urinary incontinence 
(SUI).
STUDY DESIGN: We created a decision tree model to compare costs and cost 
effectiveness of 3 strategies for the initial treatment of SUI: (1) continence 
pessary, (2) pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT), and (3) midurethral sling 
(MUS). We identified probabilities of SUI after 12 months of use of a pessary, 
PFMT, or MUS using published data. Parameter estimates included Health Utility 
Indices of no incontinence (.93) and persistent incontinence (0.7) after 
treatment. Morbidities associated with MUS included mesh erosion, retention, de 
novo urge incontinence, and recurrent SUI. Cost data were derived from Medicare 
in 2012 US dollars. One- and 2-way sensitivity analysis was used to examine the 
effect of varying rates of pursuing surgery if conservative management failed 
and rates of SUI cure with pessaries and PFMT. The primary outcome was an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold <$50,000.
RESULTS: Compared to PFMT, initial treatment of SUI with MUS was the more 
cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$32,132/quality-adjusted life year. Initial treatment with PFMT was also 
acceptable as long as subjective cure was >35%. In 3-way sensitivity analysis, 
subjective cure would need to be >40.5% for PFMT and 43.5% for a continence 
pessary for the MUS scenario to not be the preferred strategy.
CONCLUSION: At 1 year, MUS is more cost effective than a continence pessary or 
PFMT for the initial treatment for SUI.

Mortality among Soviet and Russian cosmonauts: 1960-2013.

Reynolds RJ, Day SM, Nurgalieva ZZ.

INTRODUCTION: Though the mortality of U.S. astronauts has been studied 
repeatedly in the last 20 yr, little is known about the long-term mortality 
trends of Soviet and Russian cosmonauts.
METHODS: Using data from 266 cosmonauts accepted into cosmonaut training from 
1960 to 2013, we document the causes of death and crude death rates among 
cosmonauts. Using standardized mortality ratios (SMR), we compared cosmonauts to 
the general populations of Russia and Ukraine, and to 330 U.S. astronauts.
RESULTS: Cosmonauts experienced significantly lower all-cause mortality risk 
compared to the general population. However, cosmonauts were at almost double 
the risk of all-cause mortality in comparison to U.S. astronauts (SMR = 190, 95% 
C.I. 154-239). Cosmonauts were also at greater risk of circulatory disease (SMR 
= 364, 95% C.I. 225-557) and cancer (SMR = 177, 95% C.I. 108-274) compared to 
U.S. astronauts. Though not statistically significant, cosmonauts experienced 
fewer fatal accidents (SMR = 88, 95% C.I. = 54-136) than their U.S. 
counterparts.
DISCUSSION: Cosmonauts are at much lower risk of all-cause mortality than the 
general populations of Russia and Ukraine, yet are at greater risk for death by 
cardiovascular disease and cancer than are U.S. astronauts. This disparity may 
have common roots with decreases in life expectancy in Russia in recent decades. 
Further research is needed to understand these trends fully.

Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate 
cancer from 2003 to 2013.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains a prevalent diagnosis with a spectrum of 
treatment choices that offer similar oncologic outcomes but differing side 
effect profiles and associated costs. As the technology for prostate radiation 
therapy has advanced, its associated costs have escalated, thus making 
cost-effectiveness analyses critical to assess the value of competing treatment 
options, including watchful waiting, surgery, brachytherapy, intensity-modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D-conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), proton beam 
therapy (PBT), and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to identify articles that 
performed a cost-effectiveness analysis on different radiation treatment options 
for localized prostate cancer, summarize their findings, and highlight the main 
drivers of cost effectiveness.
METHODS: A literature search was performed on two databases, PubMed and the 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry ( https://research.tufts-nemc.org/cear4 ), 
using search terms that included 'prostate', 'cost effectiveness prostate 
radiation' and 'cost analysis comparative effectiveness prostate radiation'. 
Studies were included in this review if the cost data were from 2002 or later, 
and outcomes reported both cost and effectiveness, preferably including a 
cost-utility analysis with the outcome of an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio with quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) as the effectiveness measure.
RESULTS: There were 14 articles between 2003 and 2013 that discussed cost 
effectiveness of prostate radiotherapy in men over the age of 65. All but four 
of the papers were from the US; the others were from Canada and the UK. The 
majority of the papers used Markov decision analysis and estimated cost from a 
payer's perspective, usually from Medicare reimbursement data. Assumptions for 
the model and utilities to calculate QALYs were estimated using published 
literature at the time of the analysis. Each analysis had a sensitivity analysis 
to compensate for the uncertainty of the model inputs. The main drivers of cost 
effectiveness were the cost of the radiation treatment and the differential 
QALYs accrued because of different treatment-related morbidities. Brachytherapy 
was consistently found to be more cost effective when compared with surgery and 
other radiation treatment options. IMRT was cost effective when compared with 
3D-CRT. PBT was not found to be cost effective in any of the analyses, mostly 
due to the high costs of PBT. SBRT was the newest technology that was analyzed, 
and it was also found to be cost effective compared with IMRT and PBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness research of prostate radiation treatments allows 
patients, providers, and payers to better understand the true value of each 
treatment choice. Due to the variation in each of these analyses (e.g., costing, 
and disease and complication assumptions, etc.), it is difficult to generalize 
the results. One must be careful in drawing conclusions from these studies and 
extrapolating to individual patients, particularly with the clear utility 
dependence seen in the majority of these studies.

Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, we have seen 
dramatic changes in morbi-mortality rates from human immunodeficiency 
virus-positive patients. If on the one hand, the immunologic 
preservation-associated with the use of current antiretroviral therapy markedly 
diminishes the incidence of opportunistic infections, on the other hand it 
extended life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals 
similarly to the general population. However, the management of critically ill 
human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients remains challenging and 
troublesome for practicing clinician. Sepsis - a complex systemic inflammatory 
syndrome in response to infection - is the second leading cause of intensive 
care unit admission in both human immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected 
populations. Recent data have emerged describing a substantial burden of sepsis 
in the infected population, in addition, to a much poorer prognosis in this 
group. Many factors contribute to this outcome, including specific etiologies, 
patterns of inflammation, underlying immune dysregulation related to chronic 
human immunodeficiency virus infection and delays in prompt diagnosis and 
treatment. This brief review explores the impact of sepsis in the context of 
human immunodeficiency virus infection, and proposes future directions for 
better management and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus-associated 
sepsis.

Tafamidis: a review of its use in familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

Scott LJ(1).

demail@springer.com.

Oral tafamidis (Vyndaqel(®)) is indicated in the EU for the treatment of 
transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis in adult patients with early stage symptomatic 
polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment and, in Argentina, 
Japan and Mexico, for delaying the peripheral neurological impairment of TTR 
familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP). It is the first disease-modifying 
pharmacotherapy to be approved for use in adult patients with early-stage 
TTR-FAP. The drug acts to kinetically stabilize the variant TTR tetramer and 
thereby prevent tetramer dissociation, the rate-limiting step in TTR misfolding 
and amyloidogenesis. In the 18-month Fx-005 study in adult patients with 
early-stage V30M TTR-FAP, there were no statistically significant differences 
between tafamidis and placebo recipients for the coprimary endpoints, the 
Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limb (NIS-LL) response rate (increase in 
NIS-LL score of <2) and the least-square mean change in Norfolk Quality-of-Life 
(QOL) Diabetic-Neuropathy Questionnaire total scores at 18 months, based on 
modified intent-to-treat analyses. However, in prespecified per-protocol 
analyses of efficacy evaluable patients, tafamidis recipients experienced 
significantly better outcomes in terms of these coprimary endpoints, with most 
(98%) tafamidis recipients showing stabilization of TTR tetramers at study end. 
Secondary endpoint outcomes also favoured tafamidis treatment over placebo. The 
beneficial effects of tafamidis in slowing deterioration of neurological 
function and health-related-QOL were maintained in long-term extension studies 
(up to 66 months). Tafamidis also stabilized TTR tetramers in patients with 
non-V30M TTR-FAP. Tafamidis was generally well tolerated, with most 
treatment-emergent adverse events being of mild to moderate intensity and very 
few patients discontinuing treatment because of these events. No new safety 
signals have emerged during long-term extension studies and post-marketing 
experience.

Toward a new philosophy of preventive nutrition: from a reductionist to a 
holistic paradigm to improve nutritional recommendations.

The reductionist approach has been predominant to date in human nutrition 
research and has unraveled some of the fundamental mechanisms at the basis of 
food nutrients (e.g., those that involve deficiency diseases). In Western 
countries, along with progress in medicine and pharmacology, the reductionist 
approach helped to increase life expectancy. However, despite 40 y of research 
in nutrition, epidemics of obesity and diabetes are growing each year worldwide, 
both in developed and developing countries, leading to a decrease in healthy 
life years. Yet, interactions between nutrition-health relations cannot be 
modeled on the basis of a linear cause-effect relation between 1 food compound 
and 1 physiologic effect but rather from multicausal nonlinear relations. In 
other words, explaining the whole from the specific by a bottom-up reductionist 
approach has its limits. A top-down approach becomes necessary to investigate 
complex issues through a holistic view before addressing any specific question 
to explain the whole. However, it appears that both approaches are necessary and 
mutually reinforcing. In this review, Eastern and Western research perspectives 
are first presented, laying out bases for what could be the consequences of 
applying a reductionist versus holistic approach to research in nutrition 
vis-à-vis public health, environmental sustainability, breeding, biodiversity, 
food science and processing, and physiology for improving nutritional 
recommendations. Therefore, research that replaces reductionism with a more 
holistic approach will reveal global and efficient solutions to the problems 
encountered from the field to the plate. Preventive human nutrition can no 
longer be considered as "pharmacology" or foods as "drugs."

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2014 Jul 15;161(2). doi: 10.7326/P14-9023.

BACKGROUND: Harms and benefits of cancer screening depend on age and comorbid 
conditions, but reliable estimates are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the harms and benefits of cancer screening by age and 
comorbid conditions to inform decisions about screening cessation.
DESIGN: Collaborative modeling with 7 cancer simulation models and common data 
on average and comorbid condition level-specific life expectancy.
SETTING: U.S. population.
PATIENTS: U.S. cohorts aged 66 to 90 years in 2010 with average health or 1 of 4 
comorbid condition levels: none, mild, moderate, or severe.
INTERVENTION: Mammography, prostate-specific antigen testing, or fecal 
immunochemical testing.
MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime cancer deaths prevented and life-years gained (benefits); 
false-positive test results and overdiagnosed cancer cases (harms). For each 
comorbid condition level, the age at which harms and benefits of screening were 
similar to that for persons with average health having screening at age 74 
years.
RESULTS: Screening 1000 women with average life expectancy at age 74 years for 
breast cancer resulted in 79 to 96 (range across models) false-positive results, 
0.5 to 0.8 overdiagnosed cancer cases, and 0.7 to 0.9 prevented cancer deaths. 
Although absolute numbers of harms and benefits differed across cancer sites, 
the ages at which to cease screening were consistent across models and cancer 
sites. For persons with no, mild, moderate, and severe comorbid conditions, 
screening until ages 76, 74, 72, and 66 years, respectively, resulted in harms 
and benefits similar to average-health persons.
LIMITATION: Comorbid conditions influenced only life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Comorbid conditions are an important determinant of harms and 
benefits of screening. Estimates of screening benefits and harms by comorbid 
condition can inform discussions between providers and patients about 
personalizing screening cessation decisions.

Cost-effectiveness of programs to eliminate disparities in elderly vaccination 
rates in the United States.

Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. michaelidis.constant@medstudent.pitt.edu.

BACKGROUND: There are disparities in influenza and pneumococcal vaccination 
rates among elderly minority groups and little guidance as to which intervention 
or combination of interventions to eliminate these disparities is likely to be 
most cost-effective. Here, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four 
hypothetical vaccination programs designed to eliminate disparities in elderly 
vaccination rates and differing in the number of interventions.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model in which we assumed a healthcare system 
perspective, 10-year vaccination program and lifetime time horizon. The cohort 
was the combined African-American and Hispanic 65 year-old birth cohort in the 
United States in 2009. We evaluated five different vaccination strategies: no 
vaccination program and four vaccination programs that varied from "low 
intensity" to "very high intensity" based on the number of interventions 
deployed in each program, their cumulative cost and their cumulative impact on 
elderly minority influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates.
RESULTS: The very high intensity vaccination program ($24,479/quality-adjusted 
life year; QALY) was preferred at willingness-to-pay-thresholds of $50,000 and 
$100,000/QALY and prevented 37,178 influenza cases, 342 influenza deaths, 1,158 
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases and 174 IPD deaths over the birth 
cohort's lifetime. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the very high intensity 
program only became cost-prohibitive (>$100,000/QALY) at less likely values for 
the influenza vaccination rates achieved in year 10 of the high intensity 
(>73.5%) or very high intensity (<76.8%) vaccination programs.
CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based vaccination program designed to eliminate 
disparities in elderly minority vaccination rates and including four 
interventions would be cost-effective.

Hopkins University School of Medicine §Johns Hopkins University School of 
Nursing, Baltimore, MD.

BACKGROUND: The number of people living with multiple chronic conditions is 
increasing, but we know little about the impact of multimorbidity on life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: We analyze life expectancy in Medicare beneficiaries by number of 
chronic conditions.
RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using single-decrement period life 
tables.
SUBJECTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (N=1,372,272) aged 67 and older 
as of January 1, 2008.
MEASURES: Our primary outcome measure is life expectancy. We categorize study 
subjects by sex, race, selected chronic conditions (heart disease, cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and Alzheimer disease), and 
number of comorbid conditions. Comorbidity was measured as a count of conditions 
collected by Chronic Conditions Warehouse and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.
RESULTS: Life expectancy decreases with each additional chronic condition. A 
67-year-old individual with no chronic conditions will live on average 22.6 
additional years. A 67-year-old individual with 5 chronic conditions and ≥10 
chronic conditions will live 7.7 fewer years and 17.6 fewer years, respectively. 
The average marginal decline in life expectancy is 1.8 years with each 
additional chronic condition-ranging from 0.4 fewer years with the first 
condition to 2.6 fewer years with the sixth condition. These results are 
consistent by sex and race. We observe differences in life expectancy by 
selected conditions at 67, but these differences diminish with age and 
increasing numbers of comorbid conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Social Security and Medicare actuaries should account for the 
growing number of beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions when 
determining population projections and trust fund solvency.

Socialized medicine and mortality.

Peltzman S(1).

Author information:

Chicago, IL , 60637, USA, samp@uchicago.edu.

Over the last century life expectancy has increased substantially and so has the 
share of health care expenditures financed by governments. In cross-country 
comparisons, the US, which has the lowest government health expenditure share, 
often has the poorest health outcomes. Is there a plausible connection between 
health outcomes and government financing of health care? This paper addresses 
this question with panel data from 20 developed countries from 1950 to 2010. I 
review the history of government involvement in health care financing over this 
period. Then I use panel regression methods to examine whether a variety of 
mortality based outcome measures are correlated with the extent of government 
involvement. The answers are robustly negative.

Cholinesterase inhibitors: cardioprotection in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease is a life shortening disease, and the lack of disease 
modifying therapy implies a huge impact on life expectancy as well as an 
outgrowing financial and socioeconomic burden. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) 
represent the first line symptomatic therapy, whose benefit to harm ratio is 
still a matter of debate. Acetylcholinesterase enzyme is a core interest for 
pharmacological and toxicological research to unmask the fine balance between 
therapeutic drug efficacy, tolerability, safety, and detrimental effects up to 
adverse drug reaction. So far, a body of evidence advocated that an increased 
vagal tone was associated to an increased risk of gastrointestinal and cardiac 
side effects (negative chronotropic, arrhytmogenic, hypotensive effects), able 
to hamper ChEIs effects on cognition, reducing administration feasibility and 
compliance, especially in older and comorbid patients. Conversely, a growing 
body of evidence is indicating a protective role of ChEIs on overall 
cardiovascular mortality in patients with dementia, through a series of in vitro 
and in vivo investigations. The present review is aimed to report the up to date 
literature in the controversial field of ChEIs and cardioprotection in dementia, 
offering a state of the art, which may constitute the conceptual framework to be 
enlarged in order to build higher evidence. Chronic vagal nerve stimulation 
acted upon by donepezil might improve long term survival through pharmacological 
properties apart from cholinesterase inhibition, able to offer cardioprotection, 
abating the overall cardiovascular risk, and, thus profiling a new line of 
therapeutic intervention for ChEI drug class.
