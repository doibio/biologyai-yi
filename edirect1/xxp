PURPOSE: We evaluated the long-term (up to 6 years) safety and efficacy of the 
selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin in patients with lower 
urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 609 patients were enrolled in a 4-year 
multicenter open label extension study. Subjects entered the study after 
completion of a 1-year open label trial that included patients who previously 
completed up to 57 weeks of double-blind, placebo controlled studies. 
Maintenance doses (0.4 or 2 x 0.4 mg daily) established in the 1-year study were 
continued. Efficacy and safety were assessed every 3 months. Primary efficacy 
evaluations were changes from baseline maximum urine flow rate and total 
American Urological Association symptom index, and the responder rates for those 
2 end points. Secondary end points were changes in American Urological 
Association subset scores, Boyarsky symptom scores, average urine flow rate, 
post-void residual urine volume, quality of life index and investigator global 
assessment.
RESULTS: Of the 609 patients who entered the 4-year extension study 159 had a 
2-year or greater prior experience with tamsulosin, yielding a potential 6-year 
experience on the medication. Of this 159 patient subset 109 completed the whole 
6 years. Initial rapid improvements from baseline in primary and secondary end 
points were maintained each year throughout the duration of the study. 
Tamsulosin was well tolerated, confirming the safety profile demonstrated in 
earlier studies. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 1.3% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the sustained efficacy, safety and 
excellent long-term tolerability of tamsulosin for up to 6 years in patients 
with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Hospital, Taiwan, ROC.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis and proper treatment of stage T1a prostate cancer 
remain unsettled. The aim of the study was to identify retrospectively some 
predictors of disease progression in stage T1a prostate cancer.
METHODS: We reported on 52 patients with stage T1a prostate cancer diagnosed 
between 1983 and 1996 at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. The recorded 
clinical follow-up, pathological staging and treatment of these patients were 
reviewed. Disease progression is defined as progressive elevation of the serum 
PSA value and proved by transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate or the 
appearance of metastatic disease. All original surgical pathology material from 
each patient was reviewed by a single pathologist and graded by the Gleason 
system.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients with T1a prostate cancer at diagnosis was 71.5 
+/- 7 years old. During the median follow-up of 7.3 years (range, 0.5 to 15 
years), four patients (7.7%) developed disease progression. Twenty-one patients 
died due to other causes and no patient died due to prostate cancer. It was 
statistically significant that the patient with pathological Gleason score > or 
= 5 had positive correlation with disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of stage T1a prostate cancer is variable. The 
presence of Gleason score > or = 5 in pathological report is usually associated 
with cancer progression. More aggressive treatment including radical 
prostatectomy or local radiotherapy is advised in those selected high risk 
patients with a long life expectancy. Patients with tumor Gleason score < 5 have 
a low risk of disease progression and can be managed conservatively; but they 
should remain under observation indefinitely.

What matters to seriously ill older persons making end-of-life treatment 
decisions?: A qualitative study.

Fried TR(1), Bradley EH.

Author information:

Connecticut 06516, USA. terri.fried@yale.edu

BACKGROUND: Several methods exist to elicit end-of-life treatment preferences. 
However, little work has been done to elicit from patients themselves the 
aspects of treatment decision-making most important to them when making 
end-of-life treatment decisions.
METHODS: Participants consisted of 23 patients, 60 years of age and older with a 
primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), or cancer identified by their physicians as having a 
limited life expectancy. They took part in in-depth semistructured interviews 
and focus groups in which they were asked to discuss how they had made previous 
decisions about the treatment of their illness and/or would think about making 
future decisions. Transcripts were analyzed qualitatively using the constant 
comparative method.
RESULTS: There were three major influences on treatment preferences: treatment 
burden, treatment outcome, and the likelihood of the outcome. Treatment burden 
was bearable if the outcome of treatment was desirable, but participants were 
less willing to endure the burden for more marginal outcomes. Certain outcomes 
were so unacceptable that they determined preference regardless of burden. 
However, some participants revealed that their willingness to tolerate these 
adverse outcomes may increase as their illness progresses. Although participants 
generally believed that physicians know with certainty the outcomes of 
treatment, most understood the concept of uncertainty, and the likelihood of a 
given outcome influenced their preferences.
CONCLUSIONS: A patient-centered approach to advance care planning needs to 
incorporate a consideration of both treatment burdens and treatment outcomes, 
including the likelihood of these outcomes. Patients' valuations of these 
outcomes may change over time.

F4, Boston, MA 02118, USA. thperls@bu.edu

Centenarians exist at the extreme of life expectancy and are rare. A number of 
pedigree and molecular genetic studies indicate that a significant component of 
exceptional longevity is genetically influenced. Furthermore, the recent 
discovery of a genetic locus on chromosome 4 indicates the powerful potential of 
studying centenarians for genetic factors that significantly modulate aging and 
susceptibility to age-related diseases. These studies include siblings and 
children of centenarians. Siblings have a significantly increased propensity to 
achieve exceptional old age and have half the mortality risk of their birth 
cohort from young adulthood through extreme old age. The children of 
centenarians are emerging as a promising model for the genetic and phenotypic 
study of aging relatively slowly and the delay and perhaps escape of important 
age-related diseases.

It is acknowledged today that the number of oldest old persons, nonagenarians 
and centenarians, is increasing rapidly. Analysis of data from Japan, where 
female life expectancy at birth approaches the assumed limit of 85 years, can 
provide unique information on whether the rate of these demographic changes is 
accelerating. Adjusted for the size of the birth cohorts, the centenarian 
doubling time (CDT i.e. the number of years needed to double the number of 
centenarians), halved in 29 years. Moreover death rates at 100 years and above 
show a clear decrease if we exclude males at age 105 and over.

Cost-effectiveness of routine immunization to control Japanese encephalitis in 
Shanghai, China.

Ding D(1), Kilgore PE, Clemens JD, Wei L, Zhi-Yi X.

Author information:
(1)School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of inactivated and live attenuated 
Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines given to infants and children in Shanghai.
METHODS: A decision-analytical model was constructed in order to compare costs 
and outcomes for three hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 children followed from 
birth in 1997 to the age of 30 years who received either no JE vaccine, 
inactivated JE vaccine (P3), or live attenuated JE vaccine (SA 14-14-2). 
Cumulative incidences of JE from birth to 30 years of age in the 
pre-immunization era, i.e. before 1968, were used to estimate expected rates of 
JE in the absence of vaccination. The economic consequences were measured as 
cost per case, per death, and per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted 
for the two JE immunization programmes.
FINDINGS: In comparison with no JE immunization, a programme using the P3 
vaccine would prevent 420 JE cases and 105 JE deaths and would save 6456 DALYs 
per 100,000 persons; the use of the SA 14-14-2 vaccine would prevent 427 cases 
and 107 deaths and would save 6556 DALYs per 100,000 persons. Both kinds of 
immunization were cost saving but the SA 14-14-2 vaccine strategy resulted in a 
saving that was 47% greater (512,456 US dollars) than that obtained with the P3 
vaccine strategy (348,246 US dollars).
CONCLUSION: Both JE immunization strategies resulted in cost savings in 
comparison with no JE immunization. This provides a strong economic rationale 
for vaccinating against JE in Shanghai and suggests that vaccination against JE 
might be economically justifiable in other parts of China and in certain other 
developing countries of Asia where the disease is endemic.

Randomized field trial of vaginal douching, pelvic inflammatory disease and 
pregnancy.

Author information:

krothman@aol.com

BACKGROUND: Several case-control studies have reported that women who use 
vaginal douche products are at increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Women who douche regularly may do so for reasons related to their risk of 
acquiring a sexually transmitted infection, introducing confounding that is 
difficult to control in non-experimental studies.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized field trial with a 1-year 
follow-up period. The study comprised 1827 women age 18-34, with no current 
indication of pelvic inflammatory disease, who were regular users of a douche 
product and who had been treated recently for a sexually transmitted bacterial 
infection or bacterial vaginosis. Women were randomly assigned to use either a 
newly designed and marketed douche product or a soft cloth towelette, and were 
resupplied with product at each bimonthly follow-up visit. We measured the 
occurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease using a combination of clinical and 
laboratory indicators. We also recorded pregnancy occurrence among participants.
RESULTS: The risk of PID among women assigned to use the douche product, 
relative to that among women assigned to use the wipe product, was 1.05 (95% 
confidence interval = 0.57-1.9). Using an alternative, less sensitive definition 
of PID gave a risk ratio of 1.26 (0.62-2.6). The probability of becoming 
pregnant was 15% lower among women assigned to use a douche product, and 33% 
lower among women who douched more frequently (ratio = 0.67; 0.42-1.08).
CONCLUSIONS: There was little or no indication of a greater risk of PID among 
women assigned to use the douche product. Douching may be related to a lower 
probability that a woman becomes pregnant.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatic fever has become uncommon in the United States while rapid 
diagnostic test technology for streptococcal antigens has improved. However, 
little is known about the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of various 
strategies for managing pharyngitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic 
streptococcus (GAS) in U.S. adults.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of several diagnostic and 
management strategies for patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature, including systematic reviews where possible. 
When costs were not available in the literature, we estimated them from our 
institution and Medicare charges.
TARGET POPULATION: Adults in the general U.S. population.
TIME HORIZON: 1 year.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Five strategies for the management of adult patients with 
pharyngitis: 1) observation without testing or treatment, 2) empirical treatment 
with penicillin, 3) throat culture using a two-plate selective culture 
technique, 4) optical immunoassay (OIA) followed by culture to confirm negative 
OIA test results, or 5) OIA alone.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per lost quality-adjusted life-days (converted to 
life-years where appropriate) and incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Empirical treatment was the least effective 
strategy at a GAS pharyngitis prevalence of 10% (resulting in 0.41 lost 
quality-adjusted life-day). Although the other four strategies had similar 
effectiveness (all resulted in about 0.27 lost quality-adjusted life-day), 
culture was the least expensive strategy.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Results were sensitive to the prevalence of GAS 
pharyngitis: OIA followed by culture was most effective when GAS pharyngitis 
prevalence was greater than 20%. Observation was least expensive when prevalence 
was less than 6%, and empirical treatment was least expensive when prevalence 
was greater than 71%. The effectiveness of strategies was also very sensitive to 
the probability of anaphylaxis: When the probability of anaphylaxis was about 
half the baseline probability, OIA/culture was most effective; when the 
probability was 1.6 times that of baseline, observation was most effective. Only 
at an OIA cost less than half of baseline did the OIA alone strategy become less 
expensive than culture. Results were not sensitive to other variations in 
probabilities or costs of diagnosis or treatment of GAS pharyngitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Observation, culture, and two rapid antigen test strategies for 
diagnostic testing and treatment of suspected GAS pharyngitis in adults have 
very similar effectiveness and costs, although culture is the least expensive 
and most effective strategy when the GAS pharyngitis prevalence is 10%. 
Empirical treatment was not the most effective or least expensive strategy at 
any prevalence of GAS pharyngitis in adults, although it may be reasonable for 
individual patients at very high risk for GAS pharyngitis as assessed by a 
clinical decision rule.

Keloid in Iraqi patients: a clinicohistopathologic study.

Sharquie KE(1), Al-Dhalimi MA.

Baghdad, Iraq. sharquie@warkaa.net

BACKGROUND: Keloid is a benign, well-demarcated area of fibrous tissue 
overgrowth that extends beyond the original defect. It is not an uncommon 
problem and is encountered frequently in daily practice.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the different clinical and histopathologic aspects of 
this disease in Iraqi people.
METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with keloid were clinically assessed. 
Histopathologic examination was performed in 16 patients. Giemsa stain was used 
in eight patients to assess the presence of mast cells.
RESULTS: There were 47 females and 41 males. The disease started in the second 
and third decades of life in 62 patients (70.5%). Itching was present in 46 
patients (52.2%) and was more predominant in those with early lesions. Darier 
sign was elicited in 22 patients (25%); all of them had itching. The duration of 
the disease ranged from 0.33 to 20 years, with a mean of 5.4 years. Spontaneous 
keloid was found in 30 patients (34%). The lesions were mainly single (63.4%). 
All of these patients had lesions on the face and upper trunk in addition to 
involvement of extremities in five of them (16.7%). BCG keloid was observed in 
females only, and it showed downward gravitational extension in three of seven 
patients (43%). The histopathologic examination of keloid in 16 patients showed 
many interesting findings, such as the presence of hyperplastic epidermis in six 
specimens (37.5%), Grenz zone in 11 patients (68.75%), telangiectasia in 12 
patients (75%), and pseudopodia extension of the growth to the adjacent tissues 
in half of the patients. Giemsa stain of eight specimens demonstrated the 
presence of mast cells in four patients (50%), more in biopsies that were taken 
from early lesions.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmaceutical care in a medicare drug benefit 
program.

Etemad LR(1), Hay JW.

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: Although there has recently been substantial interest in a Medicare 
drug benefit program, little attention has focused on ensuring improved access 
to medication monitoring for Medicare beneficiaries. Using a societal 
perspective, we evaluated the impact pharmacists could have on inappropriate 
prescribing, patient compliance, and medication-related morbidity and mortality 
within a Medicare drug benefits program.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was 
performed. A comprehensive MEDLINE search for relevant literature identified 
data sources and model parameters.
RESULTS: In the base case, a pharmaceutical care benefit in the elderly 
population would cost US dollars 2100 (year 2000 prices) per life-year saved, 
which is highly cost-effective. Reasonable changes in model parameters did not 
raise the cost-effectiveness ratio above US dollars 13000 per life-year saved.
CONCLUSION: Despite limitations in both the quantity and the specificity of data 
available, pharmaceutical care appears to be a highly cost-effective 
augmentation to a Medicare drug benefit program. This result is robust to model 
parameter changes. This model is conservative in that it does not include 
ongoing benefits from medication monitoring or increased elderly drug 
utilization and polypharmacy as the Medicare drug program is phased in.

The impact of including passive benefits in cost-effectiveness analysis: the 
case of automated external defibrillators on commercial aircraft.

Cram P(1), Vijan S, Wolbrink A, Fendrick AM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa School of Medicine, Iowa 
City, IA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Traditional cost-utility analysis assumes that all benefits from 
health-related interventions are captured by the quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained by the few individuals whose outcome is improved by the 
intervention. However, it is possible that many individuals who do not directly 
benefit from an intervention receive utility, and therefore QALYs, because of 
the passive benefit (aka sense of security) provided by the existence of the 
intervention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact that 
varying quantities of passive benefit have on the cost-effectiveness of airline 
defibrillator programs.
METHODS: A decision analytic model with Markov processes was constructed to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of defibrillator deployment on domestic 
commercial passenger aircraft over 1 year. Airline passengers were assigned 
small incremental utility gains (.001-.01) during an estimated 3-hour flight to 
evaluate the impact of passive benefit on overall cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis with no allowance for passive benefit, the 
cost-effectiveness of airline automated external defibrillator deployment was US 
dollars 34000 per QALY gained. If 1% of all passengers received utility gain 
of.01, the cost-effectiveness declined to US dollars 30000. Cost-effectiveness 
was enhanced when the quantity of passive benefit was raised or the percentage 
of individuals receiving passive benefit increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated external defibrillator deployment on passenger aircraft 
is likely to be cost-effective. If a small percentage of airline passengers 
receive incremental utility gains from passive benefit of automated external 
defibrillator availability, the impact on overall cost-effectiveness may be 
substantial. Further research should attempt to clarify the magnitude and 
percentage of patients who receive passive benefit.

Future burden and costs of smoking-related disease in the Netherlands: a dynamic 
modeling approach.

Author information:
(1)National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, the 
Netherlands. marianne.van.genugten@rivm.nl

OBJECTIVES: In this article, we explore the future health gain of different 
policy measures to reduce smoking prevalence: health education campaigns 
specifically aimed at keeping (young) people from starting to smoke, campaigns 
aimed at persuading smokers to quit, and tax measures.
METHODS: We drew up different policy scenarios based on evaluations of several 
health promotion campaigns. Implementing these into the dynamic multistate 
models, we simulated smoking prevalence, loss of life-years, and costs for 
several decades into the next century.
RESULTS: In the short run, campaigns aimed at potential "quitters" appear to be 
most effective in terms of health gain. However, their effect fades away after 
several decades, while campaigns aimed at young "starters" or tax measures in 
the end yield a larger and more lasting decrease in smoking attributable disease 
burden.
CONCLUSION: Dynamic modeling is very useful tool in calculating costs and 
effects of preventive public health measures.

Author information:
(1)Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute, Department of Geriatrics and Adult 
Development, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.

BACKGROUND: Surveys have shown that physicians in the United States report both 
receiving and honoring requests for physician assistance with a hastened death. 
The characteristics of patients requesting and receiving physician aid in dying 
are important to the development of public policy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine patient characteristics associated with acts of 
physician-assisted suicide.
DESIGN: Physicians among specialties involved in care of the seriously ill and 
responding to a national representative prevalence survey on physician-assisted 
suicide and euthanasia were asked to describe the demographic and illness 
characteristics of the most recent patient whose request for assisted dying they 
refused as well as the most recent request honored.
RESULTS: Of 1902 respondents (63% of those surveyed), 379 described 415 
instances of their most recent request refused and 80 instances of the most 
recent request honored. Patients requesting assistance were seriously ill, near 
death, and had a significant burden of pain and physical discomfort. Nearly half 
were described as depressed at the time of the request. The majority made the 
request themselves, along with family. In multivariate analysis, physicians were 
more likely to honor requests from patients making a specific request who were 
in severe pain (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-5.7) or 
discomfort (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-16.1), had a life 
expectancy of less than 1 month (odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 
1.7-10.8), and were not believed to be depressed at the time of the request 
(odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.5).
CONCLUSION: Persons requesting and receiving assistance in dying are seriously 
ill with little time to live and a high burden of physical suffering.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between quality-of-life (QOL) impairment as 
reported by patients and QOL impairment as judged by nurses or physicians, with 
and without consideration of spiritual well-being (SWB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 163 patients with advanced cancer were enrolled 
onto a therapeutic trial, and cross-sectional data were derived from clinical 
and demographic questionnaires obtained at baseline, including assessment of 
patient QOL and SWB. Clinicians rated the QOL impairment of their patients as 
mild, moderate, or severe. Clinician-estimated QOL impairment and 
patient-derived QOL categories were compared. Correlation coefficients were 
estimated to associate QOL scores using different instruments. The analysis of 
variance method was used to compare Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-General scores on categorical variables.
RESULTS: There was no significant association between self-assessment scores and 
marital status, education level, performance status, or predicted life 
expectancy. However, a strong relationship between SWB and QOL was noted (P 
<.0001). Clinician-estimated QOL impairment matched the level of patient-derived 
QOL correctly in approximately 60% of cases, with only slight variation 
depending on the method of categorizing patient-derived QOL scores. The accuracy 
of clinician estimates was not associated with the level of SWB. Interestingly, 
a subset analysis of the inaccurate estimates revealed an association between 
lower SWB and clinician underestimation of QOL impairment (P =.0025).
CONCLUSION: Clinician estimates of QOL impairment were accurate in more than 60% 
of patients. SWB is strongly associated with QOL, but it is not associated with 
the overall accuracy of clinicians' judgments about QOL impairment.

The product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (Rb) can control cell 
proliferation and promote differentiation. Murine embryos nullizygous for Rb die 
midgestation with defects in cell cycle regulation, control of apoptosis, and 
terminal differentiation of several tissues, including skeletal muscle, nervous 
system, and lens. Previous cell culture-based experiments have suggested that 
the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and Ras operate in a common pathway to control 
cellular differentiation. Here we have tested the hypothesis that the 
proto-oncogene N-ras participates in Rb-dependent regulation of differentiation 
by generating and characterizing murine embryos deficient in both N-ras and Rb. 
We show that deletion of N-ras rescues a unique subset of the developmental 
defects associated with nullizygosity of Rb, resulting in a significant 
extension of life span. Rb(-/-); N-ras(-/-) skeletal muscle has normal fiber 
density, myotube length and thickness, in contrast to Rb-deficient embryos. 
Additionally, Rb(-/-); N-ras(-/-) muscle shows a restoration in the expression 
of the late muscle-specific gene MCK, and this correlates with a significant 
potentiation of MyoD transcriptional activity in Rb(-/-); N-ras(-/-), compared 
to Rb(-/-) myoblasts in culture. The improved differentiation of skeletal muscle 
in Rb(-/-); N-ras(-/-) embryos occurs despite evidence of deregulated 
proliferation and apoptosis, as seen in Rb-deficient animals. Our findings 
suggest that the control of differentiation and proliferation by Rb are 
genetically separable.

Argentina.

Obesity is associated to chronic metabolic entities affecting the quality of 
life and life expectancy. An early treatment, if efficient, can overcome most of 
the problems. The normalisation of body composition, of energy reserves and 
their distribution, as well as the minimisation of weight dependent metabolic 
upsets and the establishment of therapeutic priorities, according to the 
repercussions of obesity, are important factors for the treatment of this 
disease. Prevention is important and its basis is teaching and the setting in 
healthy life style with modification of the food habits and the incorporation of 
physical work into everyday activities. Diet therapy, physical activity, 
pharmacotherapy, surgery education and psychology are the forms proposed for the 
treatment and prevention of obesity.

Failure of obliteration of the urachus in intrauterine life results in 
anatomically recognizable distinct anomalies. The urachus is located between the 
umbilicus and apex of the bladder. However, this anatomic feature does not 
always exist, and this may lead to misdiagnosis of the urachal pathologies. A 
5-year-old boy with infected urachal sinus is presented. The urachus showed an 
unusual anatomic course with its extension from the umbilicus to the right 
lateral side of the bladder instead of the apex of the organ.

Internet sources of information on Hispanic health.

Burns N(1), Carney K.

Author information:
(1)Department of Nursing, University of Texas at Arlington, USA.

This article, an introductory survey of sources relevant to the Hispanic 
population in the United States, emphasizes Hispanic health defined broadly--for 
example, income, education, living standards, and health items including 
immunizations, major diseases, and life expectancy. The focus is Internet 
sources. To provide comparable data for research, national government sources 
are stressed. The Census Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services 
are highlighted. Both agencies are increasingly providing information on 
Hispanics. Census publications include the decennial census, current population 
reports, the American Community Survey, and monographs on the Hispanic 
population. Two important components of the Department of Health and Human 
Services for researchers on Hispanic health are the National Center for Health 
Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control. In addition, sources cited are 
other federal publications including the Federal Reserve Bank, state health 
departments, and private sources.

The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on the identification of 
some combination of the clinical motor signs of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor 
and postural instability. Three levels of diagnostic confidence are 
differentiated: possible, probable, and definite. The diagnosis of possible and 
probable Parkinson's disease based on clinical criteria alone, while definite 
diagnosis requires neuropathologic confirmation. To differentiate Parkinson's 
disease (idiopathic Parkinsonian syndrome) and other Parkinsonian syndromes is 
of increasing importance considering the therapy and life expectancy of the 
patients. Recently the functional imaging technics have been more and more 
helpful in the early differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

Lifetime costs for medical services: a methodological review.

Jacobs P(1), Golmohammadi K, Longobardi T.

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: Guidelines for economic evaluation studies recommend that modeling 
be undertaken to estimate long-term, downstream costs. In this study, we conduct 
a review of a sample of studies that estimated the lifetime medical care costs 
for a variety of conditions.
METHODS: We developed a categorization of the elements for a lifetime-costing 
study and based on these elements, we abstracted information from a sample of 33 
papers in the following areas: study subject, purpose, scope, methods (including 
time profile, utilization, and cost), and results.
RESULTS: We analyzed papers that were observational, models or that combined the 
two approaches. The time profiles were estimated from registry and published 
data. Utilization data were obtained from administrative data, chart reviews, 
and professional opinion. Costs were obtained from administrative and financial 
records and were estimated using all charges, allocated costs, and provider 
payments. We noted wide variations in methods and reporting practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Following current guidelines (CCOHTA), lifetime models can be more 
easily interpreted and applied if investigators are more clear in their study 
aims, if they incorporate assumptions that are based on current data, if they 
follow current methodological practices (such as deflation, discounting, and 
sensitivity analyses), and if reporting is more transparent.

Effect of including (versus excluding) fates worse than death on utility 
measurement.

Administrative Sciences, Athens 30602-2354, USA. dfranic@rx.uga.edu

OBJECTIVES: Most studies typically measure health preferences excluding health 
states perceived as worse than death. The objective of this study is to test the 
impact of including (versus excluding) health states perceived to be worse than 
death on utility measurement using standard gamble (SG) and visual analogue 
scale (VAS) methods.
METHODS: By means of a cross-sectional descriptive study design, women were 
asked to rate the utility of three hypothetical breast cancer health states: 
cure, treatment, and recurrence (n=119). Preference weights were estimated, 
allowing for negative utilities with death (perfect health) scaled at zero 
(1.0).
RESULTS: Unpaired t-test analysis showed significantly greater change in SG and 
VAS weights for individuals perceiving cancer recurrence as worse than death 
than those perceiving death as least desirable state. Excluding negative 
utilities from the study resulted in significantly smaller changes in utility. 
Study results show that preference elicitation methods can be successfully 
adapted to acquire negative utilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in utility were greater when negative preferences were 
permitted. Addressing negative preference scores could significantly affect 
quality adjusted life year estimates in economic analyses.

Huntington's disease: what we learned from the original essay.

USA. okun@neurology.ufl.edu

BACKGROUND: Since the first descriptions of chorea in the Middle Ages, medicine 
has been captivated by the mysterious appearance of patients suffering from 
contortions of the body. Many innocent victims were persecuted and even tried as 
witches as the medical community struggled to arrive at a better understanding 
of Huntington's disease.
DESIGN/METHODS: The contributions, before and after Huntington's essay, that 
have led to a better understanding of adult onset hereditary chorea are examined 
in this paper. A review is undertaken of the American and international medical 
literature including articles, books, and journals. The impact of Huntington's 
original essay is discussed in detail.
RESULTS: The history of adult onset chorea dates back to the Middle Ages when 
descriptions were vague, and sufferers were persecuted. Nineteenth century 
doctors recognized and reported the distinct entity of adult onset hereditary 
chorea. Perhaps with the help of an expanded life expectancy, George Huntington 
described the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern as well as other 
characteristic features of the disease. Later, distinctive phenotypes and the 
juvenile form were reported. The modern history of the disease remained 
relatively quiescent until the discovery of the causative gene in 1983. This 
discovery marked a new era in the history of adult onset chorea.
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate descriptions before and after Huntington's essay about 
hereditary chorea have provided humanity to sufferers and the nidus for new 
discovery within the field of movement disorders.

Radiation-induced gliomas: report of 10 cases and review of the literature.

Salvati M(1), Frati A, Russo N, Caroli E, Polli FM, Minniti G, Delfini R.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery-INM Neuromed, Pozzilli (Is), University of Rome La 
Sapienza, Via Cardinal Agliardi 15, 00165 Rome, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy and more recently radiosurgery represent important 
therapeutic methods for the treatment of tumors and arterovenous malformations 
affecting the central nervous system, even though several significant 
side-effects have been described (radionecrosis, tumors, etc.). Gliomas induced 
by radiation therapy are decidedly unusual, and the first descriptions of this 
association only appeared in the 1960s.
METHODS: The pertinent literature was reviewed to yield 116 cases in which a 
glioma developed after radiotherapy for cranial pathologies (included 10 
personal cases treated in our Institution). One of our patients had undergone 
radiosurgery for a cavernous angioma.
RESULTS: Patients who developed a radiation-induced glioma were younger, as a 
group, than those affected with so-called "spontaneous" gliomas. The tumor 
originated in the previously irradiated area, after average doses of 32 Gy and 
an average latency period of 9.6 years in accordance with the findings reported 
by the authors and in our experience as well. Radiotherapy had most frequently 
been performed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our Case 10 is the fourth case 
of intracranial tumor arising after radiosurgery to be described in the 
literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Though rare, gliomas may represent a late complication of radiation 
treatment. The behavior of the radiation-induced variety of glioma does not seem 
to differ significantly from that of its "spontaneous" counterpart. Late 
complications of the radiosurgery are probably underestimated because of the 
relatively recent introduction of this technique. On the contrary, these should 
be scrupulously evaluated when deciding whether to employ this method for 
therapeutic purposes for relatively benign or congenital lesions (which 
generally affect young patients with a long life expectancy).

Premature termination of telomeric extension-PCR for detection of telomerase 
activity.

Author information:

University, 220 Handan Road, Shanghai 200433, P.R. China. rachen1970@yahoo.com

In this article, we report a simple, rapid, and efficient method to detect 
telomerase activity: the premature termination of telomeric extension-PCR 
(PTEP). Similar to the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), this 
method is based on PCR amplification following the in vitro telomerase reaction, 
while the in vitro telomerase reaction here is prematurely, rather than 
randomly, terminated. Apart from this, the telomeric extension products are used 
as initial primers, instead of as templates, to trigger the amplification with a 
specially constructed plasmid DNA as the template that cannot be directly 
amplified with the telomerase primer. The end product is a specific 159-bp DNA 
fragment that reflects telomerase activity. Because its product can be clearly 
identified with routine agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide 
staining, PTEP allows even lesser-equipped laboratories to easily detect 
telomerase activity.

BACKGROUND: Controversy persists about the most efficient allocation of 
healthcare funds for cardiovascular disease prevention. Previous economic 
analyses have generally focused on primary or secondary prevention as discrete 
categories.
OBJECTIVES: To address the information required by decision-makers to distribute 
budgets optimally across an entire population at risk in view of recommendations 
promulgated by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 
III (NCEP ATP III).
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Continuum of Risk Evaluation (CORE) model is an 
individual patient simulation of the occurrence of cardiovascular disease 
allowing for analyses over a broad range of risk. All events are tallied, costs 
are applied, and survival is modified accordingly. Disaggregated presentation of 
the results allows decision-makers to evaluate the budgetary implications and 
cost effectiveness of different strategies according to the risk at which 
treatment is initiated. This process is illustrated for the United States using 
information from the 1988-1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
and pravastatin trials.
RESULTS: Secondary prevention with pravastatin costs dollar 2900 per life-year 
gained for men and dollar 1100 per life-year gained for women. Lowering the 
treatment threshold to incorporate primary prevention yields cost-effectiveness 
ratios that remain below dollar 25 000 per undiscounted life-year gained until a 
10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 14.4%. Cost savings are possible for very 
high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic impact of an integrated approach to prevention of 
cardiovascular disease has not been thoroughly explored. CORE permits realistic 
analysis of policy decisions involving the entire continuum of risk rather than 
isolated consideration of specific disease stages, and thus provides a unique 
tool for assessing the full implications of treatment guidelines such as those 
of the NCEP ATP III.

When to Start Antiretroviral Therapy and What to Start With-- A European 
Perspective.

Although antiretroviral combination therapy has greatly improved the life 
expectancy of HIV-infected individuals, its use is hampered by considerable 
toxicity, the need for life-long near-perfect adherence to strict dosing 
regimens in order to avoid the emergence of drug resistance, and high cost. In 
this paper we review current understanding of when to best initiate 
antiretroviral therapy and what regimen to start with. The limitations of 
antiretroviral combination therapy are increasingly clear, and this has led to 
the current tendency to delay the initiation of therapy until CD4 cell counts 
have consistently dropped toward the 200 cells/mm(3 )mark, or until plasma HIV-1 
RNA has increased to above 100,000 copies/mL. The need for optimal adherence 
also implies a "readiness" on the part of the patient to start treatment. Once 
the decision to commence therapy has been reached, what particular combinations 
of drugs to start with increasingly demands an individualized approach.

Older individuals (>50 years of age) are increasingly sustaining spinal cord 
injuries (SCI) and often have pre-existing medical conditions, including 
hypertension. Furthermore, the life expectancy of individuals with paraplegia 
has increased to near that of able-bodied individuals. Thus, chronic diseases 
associated with aging (e.g. hypertension) are increasing in this population. We 
tested the hypothesis that paraplegia differentially increases blood pressure
