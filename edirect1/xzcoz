Kaplan-Meier's survival curve analysis showed a coefficient of 0.25-60 months 
(confidence interval -0.31 and 0.81).
DISCUSSION: The percentage of complications and the high rate of revisions 
recorded in our sample confirm that telescopic nail is the gold standard in the 
treatment of femoral fractures in patients with OI type 3.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients under the age of 4, with narrow medullary canals, low 
life expectancy, few to nil rehabilitative prospectives or severe comorbidities, 
the use of TEN may be considered as a less invasive approach compared to 
telescopic nail surgery, however only temporarily, as it will still most 
probably require a surgical revision a few years down the line.

PURPOSE: This study estimated utility weights based on the response to treatment 
for atopic dermatitis in the general population.
METHODS: The Korean general population aged 20-60 years was stratified by using 
a random sampling method based on age and sex. Two hypothetical health states of 
atopic dermatitis were developed: response to treatment and no response to 
treatment. Health utility values were estimated by using time trade-off (TTO) 
based on a period of 10 years, TTO based on life expectancy, and EuroQol 
5-Dimension (EQ-5D) including a visual analog scale (VAS). The mean utility 
value and 95% CI were derived, and comparisons of subgroups using the t test and 
ANOVA were performed. We conducted a multilevel analysis after controlling the 
sociodemographic variables to consider repeated measures.
FINDINGS: A total of 155 participants were included in the survey. Their mean 
age was 39.7 years; 58.7% of participants were women. The mean health utility 
values for response and no response using TTO based on 10 years were 0.847 and 
0.380, respectively. The estimated health utility values of response and no 
response were 0.865 and 0.476 using TTO based on life expectancy, and 0.814 and 
0.279 using EQ-5D. For VAS, the response and no response were 0.744 and 0.322. 
After controlling the covariates, the important factors that affected utility 
values were response and no response to treatment (P < 0.001).
IMPLICATIONS: This study showed that the utility weights of people with no 
response to atopic dermatitis treatment were lower compared with response from 
the general population. Health care providers should therefore consider symptom 
control as an important factor affecting the quality of life of those with 
atopic dermatitis.

BACKGROUND: Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare photodermatosis causing a significant 
impact on patients' quality of life (QoL), and treatment is often challenging.
AIM: To analyse clinical experience with a tailored stepwise therapeutic 
approach.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used. Patients with suspected SU 
underwent laboratory investigations and photoprovocation. Those with a high 
minimal urticaria dose (MUD) were treated with a single antihistamine (protocol 
1), and those with a lower MUD received three types of antihistamines (protocol 
2); both protocols included a leucotriene receptor antagonist (LRA). In cases of 
failure, treatment was switched to omalizumab at doses of < 300 mg/month with 
incremental dosage increases as necessary (monthly dose range, 150-600 
mg/month). Symptom relief and photoprovocation under treatment were evaluated.
RESULTS: In total, 30 patients (10 men, 20 women) were enrolled. Most (87%) were 
sensitive to visible light (1-70 J/cm2 ) with or without extension to 
ultraviolet A. Of the 30 patients, 23 opted for our stepwise approach: 22 
achieved complete remission on protocols 1 or 2 (n = 17) or after switching to 
omalizumab (n = 5), and another patient achieved partial remission under 
omalizumab. There were no treatment-related severe adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of SU can be well controlled by treatment with 
antihistamines and an LRA tailored to the degree of photosensitivity, followed 
by omalizumab in refractory cases. This has important implications for patient 
QoL.

in survival rate.

Functional traits are an important aspect of long-term breeding strategies for 
dairy cattle. In this regard, it is necessary to develop simple methods for 
estimating the economic value of herd life. In this study, the economic daily 
value of herd life was estimated when survival rate varied between -0.05 and 
0.05 from the basal survival rate. The extension days per survival rate were 
26.5 days in Hokkaido and 20.3 days in other regions. The increases in values of 
annual income per day of herd life were 95.18 yen in Hokkaido and 101.80 yen in 
other regions. The relative economic weights of milk yield to herd life per 
genetic standard deviation were 0.668 in Hokkaido and 1.03 in other regions. 
Estimated increments in yearly profits based on young sire selection for herd 
life were 963 yen in Hokkaido and 1,030 yen in other regions. The estimated 
increments in annual profits based on young sire selection for milk yield were 
1,268 yen in Hokkaido and 2,097 yen in other regions. Given that economic value 
was linearly correlated with herd-life length, the linear regression 
coefficients between these factors could be used to estimate the economic value 
of herd-life length.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who 
experience acute exacerbations usually require treatment with oral steroids or 
antibiotics, depending on the etiology of the exacerbation. Current management 
is based on clinician's assessment and judgement, which lacks diagnostic 
accuracy and results in overtreatment. A test to guide these decisions in 
primary care is in development. We developed an early decision model to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of this treatment stratification test in the primary care 
setting in the United Kingdom.
METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed of COPD 
progression and the exacerbation care pathway. Sensitivity analysis was carried 
out to guide technology development and inform evidence generation requirements.
RESULTS: The base case test strategy cost GBP 423 (USD 542) less and resulted in 
a health gain of 0.15 quality-adjusted life-years per patient compared with not 
testing. Testing reduced antibiotic prescriptions by 30 percent, potentially 
lowering the risk of antimicrobial resistance developing. In sensitivity 
analysis, the result depended on the clinical effects of treating patients 
according to the test result, as opposed to treating according to clinical 
judgement alone, for which there is limited evidence. The results were less 
sensitive to the accuracy of the test.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing may be cost-saving in primary care, but this requires 
robust evidence on whether test-guided treatment is effective. High quality 
evidence on the clinical utility of testing is required for early modeling of 
diagnostic tests generally.

PURPOSE: Accurate life expectancy prediction is essential in decision-making 
concerning treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). Nomogram 
predictions are more precise and reproducible than clinician's estimations. The 
most accurate nomogram addressing 10-year life expectancy in PCa patients has 
not been externally validated to date. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the 
performance of this nomogram in a contemporary external cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this, we enrolled all consecutive patients, who 
underwent radical prostatectomy at a single institution between 2005 and 2007. 
Age at surgery and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were assessed. PCa-related 
deaths and patients under 55 years were excluded as indicated by the nomogram. 
The prediction of 10-year life expectancy was calculated according to the 
nomogram and compared to actual survival data. Calibration and discrimination 
were assessed using calibration plots.
RESULTS: Overall, 1597 patients were evaluated, with a median age of 64 years 
(range 55-78 years) at surgery and a median follow-up of 134.4 months (range 
0.1-161.7 months). Median CCI was 0 (range 0-10). At 10 years, 134 patients 
(8.4%) had died of other causes than PCa. The nomogram showed moderate 
discrimination capacities on receiver-operator characteristic analysis (c-index: 
0.64). On calibration curves, the nomogram underestimated the actual life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The performance accuracy of this prediction model was moderate and 
underestimated 10-year life expectancy of contemporary PCa patients. In 
conclusion, prediction of life expectancy remains challenging with a continued 
need for more precise tools.

For the estimation of perioperative risks and mortality in the context of 
radical urological tumor surgery in elderly patients, the guidelines meanwhile 
require the use of geriatric assessments. The aim of this work is therefore to 
explain frequently used geriatric assessments and to give an overview of their 
predictive significance in radical urological tumor surgery. Comprehensive 
geriatric assessments provide a good description of the patient's state of 
health, but are hardly feasible in clinical routine due to their complexity. It 
is more reasonable to use screening tools with subsequent targeted examination 
of high-risk patients. Special tools allow the standardized assessment of 
functional status, mobility, cognition, mood, nutrition, frailty, comorbidities 
and polypharmacy and have different prognostic significance. Evidence on the 
predictive value of assessments prior to radical urological tumor surgery is 
mainly described for the systematic classification of comorbidities. In 
cystectomy, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score allow an estimation of the risk of complications 
and mortality. The focus of assessments prior to prostatectomy is to identify 
patients with sufficient life expectancy to benefit from radical surgery. CCI 
and ASA scores as well as the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 
can help to assess the risk of perioperative complications in kidney tumor 
surgery.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with dementia are at high risk for hip fractures and often 
have poor outcomes when a fracture is sustained. Despite this poor prognosis, 
little data are available on what factors should be prioritized to guide 
surgical decision making in these cases. We aimed to understand the 
decision-making process for older dementia patients hospitalized after hip 
fractures.
DESIGN: We performed a qualitative analysis of in-depth elite interviews 
conducted with a clinical care team involved in management of patients with 
dementia after hospitalization for hip fractures.
SETTING: Interviews were conducted with an interprofessional team involved in 
the care of patients with dementia after being hospitalized for hip fractures.
PARTICIPANTS: Interviewees included nine orthopaedic surgeons, three 
hospitalists, three geriatricians, five nurses, three occupational therapists, 
three physical therapists, and two clinical ethicists.
MEASUREMENTS: Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analyzed and coded 
using QSR International's NVivo 10 qualitative database management software.
RESULTS: The three main themes that most interviewees discussed were pain 
control, functional status, and medical comorbidities. Interviewees brought up 
many factors related to restoring functional status including baseline 
functional status, rehabilitation potential, social support, and the importance 
of mobility. Dementia and its impact on rehabilitation potential were mentioned 
by all geriatricians.
CONCLUSION: Although frailty, prognosis, and life expectancy were largely absent 
from the responses, the emphasis on dementia, advanced directives, and involving 
family or caregivers by the three geriatricians indicates the importance of 
including geriatricians in the decision-making team for these patients.

OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to determine the health burden of 
preventable disease in Australia.
METHODS: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses) statement guidelines were followed to identify, screen and 
describe the protocols used in the systematic review.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the review. Data on the health burden 
associated with lifestyle-related risk factors were extracted by disease with 
outcomes reported in attributable number and proportion of deaths, years of life 
lost, years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
Around one-third of DALYs was attributed to all modifiable risk factors. The 
range of estimates of DALYs attributable to each prioritised risk factor was: 
combined dietary risk factors, 7.2% to 9.7%; tobacco, 7.9% to 9.0%; alcohol, 
5.1% to 12.2%; high body mass, 5.5% to 8.3%; and physical inactivity, 1.2% to 
5.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the methods used to estimate preventable health burden 
varied greatly between studies, all found that a substantial amount of death and 
disability was attributable to lifestyle-related risk factors. Implications for 
public health: There is a large health burden in Australia caused by modifiable 
risk factors and further action is warranted to address this burden.

Cancer.

PURPOSE: Treatment decisions about localized prostate cancer depend on accurate 
estimation of the patient's life expectancy. Current cancer and noncancer 
survival models use a limited number of predefined variables, which could 
restrict their predictive capability. We explored a technique to create more 
comprehensive survival prediction models using insurance claims data from a 
large administrative data set. These data contain substantial information about 
medical diagnoses and procedures, and thus may provide a broader reflection of 
each patient's health.
METHODS: We identified 57,011 Medicare beneficiaries with localized prostate 
cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. We constructed separate cancer survival 
and noncancer survival prediction models using a training data set and assessed 
performance on a test data set. Potential model inputs included clinical and 
demographic covariates, and 8,971 distinct insurance claim codes describing 
comorbid diseases, procedures, surgeries, and diagnostic tests. We used a least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator technique to identify predictive 
variables in the final survival models. Each model's predictive capacity was 
compared with existing survival models with a metric of explained randomness 
(ρ2) ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating an ideal prediction.
RESULTS: Our noncancer survival model included 143 covariates and had improved 
survival prediction (ρ2 = 0.60) compared with the Charlson comorbidity index (ρ2 
= 0.26) and Elixhauser comorbidity index (ρ2 = 0.26). Our cancer-specific 
survival model included nine covariates, and had similar survival predictions 
(ρ2 = 0.71) to the Memorial Sloan Kettering prediction model (ρ2 = 0.68).
CONCLUSION: Survival prediction models using high-dimensional variable selection 
techniques applied to claims data show promise, particularly with noncancer 
survival prediction. After further validation, these analyses could inform 
clinical decisions for men with prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increasing drug prices lead to payer coverage restrictions, 
which limit access to therapy. We assessed the cost effectiveness of rifaximin 
in management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) 
under common payer coverage restrictions and determined the maximum price at 
which rifaximin would be cost effective using contemporary cost-effectiveness 
thresholds.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate quality of life, 
cost, and cost effectiveness of rifaximin for patients with IBS-D and complete 
noncoverage (insurer pays none of the drug cost), unrestricted access (insurer 
pays 100% of the drug cost), and formulary-restricted access (insurer pays 100% 
of the drug cost after for patients failed by initial therapy). The maximum 
cost-effective drug price was determined for each level of drug coverage using 
threshold analysis adjusted for willingness to pay thresholds from $50,000 to 
$150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Analysis was performed from a 
payer perspective with a 1-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Unrestricted and formulary-restricted access were more effective than 
complete non-coverage, resulting in additional 0.03 and 0.05 QALYs gained over 
noncoverage. However, unrestricted and formulary-restricted coverage were more 
expensive. At current drug prices, unrestricted or formulary-restricted coverage 
would cost an additional $1,207,136 or $171,850/QALY gained, compared to 
complete non-coverage. A 12% to 62% price reduction ($18.46 to $26.34/pill) for 
formulary-restricted access and 84% to 88% price reduction ($3.53 to $4.71/pill) 
for unrestricted access would be needed for rifaximin to be a cost-effective 
treatment strategy. Rifaximin retreatment intervals, response rates, and adverse 
events were important factors in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Using a decision analytic model, we show that payer coverage for 
rifaximin for patients with IBS-D exceeds generally accepted cost-effectiveness 
thresholds at current drug prices. Improved payer coverage could be justified 
using value-based pricing methods.

Rust of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) caused by Puccinia helianthi Schwein. 
is a major sunflower disease in Mozambique where local ecotypes, from Peredovik 
and Record selections, and South African commercial varieties were all 
susceptible to race 4, which was prevalent among isolates collected from 1996 to 
1997 (1). Disease surveys carried out in southern Mozambique (Maputo) from 
August until September 2002 revealed an increase in the incidence and severity 
of sunflower rust compared to previous investigations on the same varieties. 
Rust symptoms, observed in all fields, appeared on the last leaf pairs of plants 
at the 5.1 growth stage. Disease severity (percentage of leaf area infected) (2) 
ranged from 20 to 60%, but the disease did not cause noticeable yield loss 
because rust infection started near the end of the season. Argentine and African 
commercial varieties and some experimental Mozambican selections from sunflower 
accessions of different origin were the most severely affected. Two rust samples 
were collected from infected leaves, stored at 5°C, and increased on the 
universal suscept (S-37-388). Race identification of both isolates was 
determined on three sets of nine differential lines (three lines per each set): 
S-37-388, CM 90 RR, MC 29; P-386, HA-R1, HA-R2; and HA-R3, HA-R4, HA-R5 using 
the triplet coding system (3). The 2-week-old seedlings (four per 10-cm pot) of 
each differential line (four pots per line) were inoculated on the upper surface 
of the first pair of true leaves. Inoculated seedlings were covered with plastic 
bags, placed in a growth chamber without light for 18 to 22 h, and then 
transferred to a greenhouse under alternate day/night temperatures of 22/18 ± 
2°C, 60 to 70% relative humidity, and 12 h of light (180 μE·m-2·s-1) per day. 
The inoculation test was repeated twice. Assessment of host differential 
reactions, 14 days after inoculation, was based on five categories of sunflower 
reaction to rust (4). Both isolates were identified as race 314 and to our 
knowledge, this is the first report of this race in Mozambique. Since P. 
helianthi completes its life cycle annually, the occurrence of new races is 
expected. The opportunity for new races to occur is particularly high and severe 
in Mozambique where all sunflower varieties grown as summer (January to June) 
and winter (August to December) crops are susceptible. References: (1) P. M.

The effects of four preplant ground cover systems as alternatives to chemical 
control of Mesocriconema xenoplax were investigated from 1991 to 1998. Ground 
cover establishment was initiated in 1991 in an orchard known to be infested 
with M. xenoplax and having a history of peach tree short life (PTSL). Ground 
cover systems included (i) Pensacola bahia grass, (ii) Tifton 9 bahia grass, 
(iii) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum 'Stacy'), and (iv) naturally occurring 
weeds that were maintained over the entire orchard floor. Ground cover 
evaluation was initiated in 1994, when herbicide was applied to the ground cover 
plots and half the weed plots were fumigated with methyl bromide. Peach trees 
were planted into all plots in 1995. Fumigation effect on M. xenoplax population 
density collapsed 25 months after application. Young peach trees grew faster for 
the first 13 months in killed Pensacola bahia grass sod and fumigated soil, 
intermediate in Tifton 9 bahia grass and wheat plots, and slowest in unfumigated 
weed plots. By the end of the experiment, tree growth was greatest in Pensacola 
bahia grass killed sod and least in the unfumigated weed plots. Preplant wheat 
was as effective as fallow for 3 years plus a preplant methyl bromide fumigation 
in increasing tree survival from PTSL.

Objectives: For this paper, we aimed to investigate the effects of Tai Chi Chuan 
(TCC) versus the Core Stability Training (CST) program on neuromuscular function 
(NF) in the lower extremities among aging individuals who suffered from 
non-specific chronic lower back pain (NLBP). Regarding the design, during a 
12-week intervention, a single-blinded randomized controlled trial was used to 
compare two intervention groups with a control group on the parameters of NF. 
Methods: Forty-three Chinese community-dwellers were randomly assigned into two 
intervention groups (three sessions per week, with each session lasting 60 min 
in TCC and CST) and a control group. The patient-based Visual Analogue Scale 
(VAS) was used to measure the level of perceived pain, while parameters of NF as 
primary outcomes were measured by the Biodex System 3 Isokinetic Dynamometer. 
Results: For the knee joint, we observed significant differences in the 
endurance of left extension at a speed of 60°/s: (1) between TCC and control 
groups (p < 0.01); (2) between CST and control groups (p < 0.01). For the ankle 
joint, significant differences between CST and control groups were observed on 
the peak torque of left dorsiflexion (p < 0.05) and the endurance of the left 
plantar flexion at a speed of 60°/s (p < 0.05). In addition, we observed a 
significant difference between TCC and control groups in the endurance of the 
right plantar flexion (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Chen-style TCC and CST were found 
to have protective effects on NF in aging individuals with NLBP, while 
alleviating non-specific chronic pain.

OBJECTIVE: Most patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the United 
States are diagnosed with stage III-IV disease. Screening for NPC in endemic 
areas results in earlier detection and improved outcomes. We examined the 
cost-effectiveness of screening for NPC with plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA among 
Asian American men in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: We used a Markov cohort model to estimate discounted life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios for screening as compared with usual care without screening.
SETTING: The base case analysis considered onetime screening for 50-year-old 
Asian American men.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Confirmatory testing was magnetic resonance imaging and 
nasopharyngoscopy. Cancer-specific outcomes, health utility values, and costs 
were determined from cancer registries and the published literature.
RESULTS: For Asian American men, usual care without screening resulted in the 
detection of NPC at stages I, II, III-IVB, and IVC among 6%, 29%, 54%, and 11% 
of those with cancer, respectively, whereas screening resulted in earlier 
detection with a stage distribution of 43%, 24%, 32%, and 1%. This corresponded 
to an additional 0.00055 QALYs gained at a cost of $63 per person: an 
incremental cost of $113,341 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, screening Asian American men was cost-effective at $100,000 per QALY 
gained in 35% of samples.
CONCLUSION: Although screening for NPC with plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA for 
50-year-old Asian American men may result in earlier detection, in this study it 
was unlikely to be cost-effective. Screening may be reasonable for certain 
subpopulations at higher risk for NPC, but clinical studies are necessary before 
implementation.

BACKGROUND: Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 5 years survival in 
minors has reached 90%, socioeconomic differences have been reported among and 
within countries. Within countries, the difference has been related to the 
socioeconomic status of the parents, even in the context of public health 
services with universal coverage. In Mexico, differences in the mortality of 
children with cancer have been reported among sociodemographic zones. The 
Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), the country's main social security 
institution, has reported socioeconomic differences in life expectancy within 
its affiliated population. Here, the socioeconomic inequalities in the survival 
of children (< 15 years old) enrolled in the IMSS were analyzed.
METHODS: Five-year survival data were analyzed in cohorts of patients diagnosed 
with ALL during the period 2007-2009 in the two IMSS networks of medical 
services that serve 7 states of the central region of Mexico. A Cox proportional 
risk model was developed and adjusted for the socioeconomic characteristics of 
family, community of residence and for the clinical characteristics of the 
children. The slope of socioeconomic inequality of the probability of dying 
within five years after the diagnosis of ALL was estimated.
RESULTS: For the 294 patients studied, the 5 years survival rate was 53.7%; the 
median survival was 4.06 years (4.9 years for standard-risk diagnosis; 2.5 years 
for high-risk diagnosis). The attrition rate was 12%. The Cox model showed that 
children who had been IMSS-insured for less than half their lives had more than 
double the risk of dying than those who had been insured for their entire lives.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in the 
survival of children with ALL associated with family income, educational and 
occupational level of parents. However, we found a relevant gradient related 
social security protection: the longer children's life insured by social 
security, the higher their probability of surviving ALL was. These results add 
evidence of the effectiveness of social security, as a mechanism of wealth 
redistribution and a promoter of social mobility. Extending these social 
security benefits to the entire Mexican population could promote better health 
outcomes.

Cost-effectiveness models that present results in terms of cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year for health technologies are used to inform policy 
decisions in many parts of the world. Health state utilities (HSUs) are required 
to calculate the quality-adjusted life-years. Even when clinical studies 
assessing the effectiveness of health technologies collect data on HSUs to 
populate a cost-effectiveness model, which rarely happens, analysts typically 
need to identify at least some additional HSUs from alternative sources. When 
possible, HSUs are identified by a systematic review of the literature, but, 
again, this rarely happens. In 2014, ISPOR established a Good Practices for 
Outcome Research Task Force to address the use of HSUs in cost-effectiveness 
models. This task force report provides recommendations for researchers who 
identify, review, and synthesize HSUs for use in cost-effectiveness models; 
analysts who use the results in models; and reviewers who critically appraise 
the suitability and validity of the HSUs selected for use in models. The 
associated Minimum Reporting Standards of Systematic Review of Utilities for 
Cost-Effectiveness checklist created by the task force provides criteria to 
judge the appropriateness of the HSUs selected for use in cost-effectiveness 
models and is suitable for use in different international settings.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a health economic model that included a great diversity 
of patient characteristics and outcomes for chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), which can be used to inform decisions about stratified medicine 
in COPD.
METHODS: The choice of patient characteristics and outcomes to include in the 
model was based on 3 literature reviews on multidimensional prognostic COPD 
indices, COPD phenotypes, and treatment effects in subgroups. A conceptual model 
was constructed including 14 patient characteristics, 7 intermediate outcomes 
(lung function, physical activity, exercise capacity, symptoms, disease-specific 
quality of life, exacerbations, and pneumonias), and 3 final outcomes 
(mortality, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs], and costs). Regression 
equations describing the statistical associations between the patient 
characteristics and intermediate and final outcomes were estimated using the 
longitudinal data of 5 large COPD trials (19,378 patients). A patient-level 
simulation model was developed in which individual patients from the baseline 
population of the 5 trials are sampled and their outcomes over lifetime are 
predicted based on the regression equations.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis (single-arm simulation representing treatment 
with tiotropium) showed that patients had a mean lung function decline of 43 
mL/year, 0.62 exacerbations/year, a worsening of their physical activity and 
quality of life with 1.48 and 1.10 points/year, a life expectancy of 11.2 years, 
7.25 QALYs, and total lifetime costs of £24,891. Results for a selection of 
treatment scenarios and subgroups were shown to demonstrate the potential of the 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a unique patient-level simulation model that can be 
used to evaluate COPD treatment options for a variety of subgroups.

BACKGROUND: The Magmaris bioresorbable magnesium scaffold was successfully 
tested in in-vitro and in clinical premarket studies. Subsequently the Magmaris 
postmarket program aimed to review intraprocedural data of at least 2000 
patients to assess user preferences, guideline adherence and intraprocedural 
performance in clinical routine.
METHODS: This international multicentre survey encompasses data from 356 
hospitals across 45 countries. As part of the certification for Magmaris 
implantation, each hospital had to complete consecutive post-market evaluation 
forms of their first 10 commercial Magmaris patients.
RESULTS: From June 2016 to May 2018, data on 2018 implantations were collected. 
Main reasons for selecting Magmaris was patients' life expectancy (67%, 
n = 1359) and low or not calcified lesions, (67%, n = 1357). Magmaris was 
successfully deployed in 99% of cases (n = 1995), predilatation was performed in 
95% (n = 1922) and post-dilatation in 87% (n = 1756). Physicians rated the 
overall performance and the pushability as good or very good in 96% of cases 
(n = 1799). Guide wire friction, trackability, and conformability were rated as 
good or very good in 94% of cases, and crossability in 93%. The majority of 
patients were scheduled to receive dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 
12 months.
CONCLUSION: Generally, implantation guidelines were adhered to and theoretical 
advantages of the metal scaffold observed in in-vitro tests have translated into 
practice with good intraprocedural performance outcomes, confirming the 
controlled roll-out of this novel technology into clinical practice.
SUMMARY FOR ANNOTATED TABLE OF CONTENT: The Magmaris 2000 program includes the 
first commercial cases at each hospital. Overall, data on 2018 implantations 
were collected. The high rate of pre- and post-dilatation as well as other 
parameters confirm that generally the implantation guidelines are adhered to and 
the good intraprocedural performance (rated as good or very good in 96%) confirm 
the theoretical advantages of a metallic scaffold in practice.

The biological markers of aging used to predict physical health status in older 
people are of great interest. Telomere shortening, which occurs during the 
process of cell replication, was initially considered a promising biomarker for 
the prediction of age and age-related outcomes (e.g., diseases, longevity). 
However, the high instability in detection and low correlation with age-related 
outcomes limit the extension of telomere length to the field of prediction. 
Currently, a growing number of studies have shown that dynamic DNA methylation 
throughout human lifetime exhibits strong correlation with age and age-related 
outcomes. Indeed, many researchers have built age prediction models with high 
accuracy based on age-dependent methylation changes in certain CpG loci. For 
now, DNA methylation based on epigenetic clocks, namely epigenetic or DNA 
methylation age, serves as a new standard to track chronological age and predict 
biological age. Measures of age acceleration (Δage, DNA methylation age - 
chronological age) have been developed to assess the health status of a person. 
In addition, there is evidence that an accelerated epigenetic age exists in 
patients with certain age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, 
cardiovascular disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the dynamic 
signatures of DNA methylation during aging and emphasize its practical utility 
in the prediction of various age-related outcomes.

of Saudi Arabia. E-mail. dr.rahabi@gmail.com.

Life expectancy has increased as a result of advancements in health care 
services; thus, maintaining healthy dentition is an important factor in overall 
health. Furthermore, the growing desire of elderly patients to maintain their 
teeth has led to an increased need for the performance of complex dental 
treatment in elderly patients. Root canal therapy is an essential phase of such 
treatments. Elderly patients may exhibit one or more systemic conditions that 
require special care, in addition to other changes that occur within the 
dentition and oral mucosa as a result of aging. These make root canal treatment 
in elderly patients a great challenge. The aim of this review was to 
characterize pathologic and physiologic changes in elderly patients that can
