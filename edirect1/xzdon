BACKGROUND: Many individuals who survive tuberculosis disease face ongoing 
disability and elevated mortality risks. However, the impact of 
post-tuberculosis sequelae is generally omitted from policy analyses and disease 
burden estimates. We therefore estimated the global burden of tuberculosis, 
inclusive of post-tuberculosis morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: We constructed a hypothetical cohort of individuals developing 
tuberculosis in 2019, including pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease. We 
simulated lifetime health outcomes for this cohort, stratified by country, age, 
sex, HIV status, and treatment status. We used disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) to summarise fatal and non-fatal health losses attributable to 
tuberculosis, during the disease episode and afterwards. We estimated 
post-tuberculosis mortality and morbidity based on the decreased lung function 
caused by pulmonary tuberculosis disease.
FINDINGS: Globally, we estimated 122 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 98-151) 
million DALYs due to incident tuberculosis disease in 2019, with 58 (38-83) 
million DALYs attributed to post-tuberculosis sequelae, representing 47% (95% UI 
37-57) of the total burden estimate. The increase in burden from 
post-tuberculosis varied substantially across countries and regions, driven 
largely by differences in estimated case fatality for the disease episode. We 
estimated 12·1 DALYs (95% UI 10·0-14·9) per incident tuberculosis case, of which 
6·3 DALYs (5·6-7·0) were from the disease episode and 5·8 DALYs (3·8-8·3) were 
from post-tuberculosis. Per-case post-tuberculosis burden estimates were greater 
for younger individuals, and in countries with high incidence rates. The burden 
of post-tuberculosis was spread over the remaining lifetime of tuberculosis 
survivors, with almost a third of total DALYs (28%, 95% UI 23-34) accruing 15 or 
more years after incident tuberculosis.
INTERPRETATION: Post-tuberculosis sequelae add substantially to the overall 
disease burden caused by tuberculosis. This hitherto unquantified burden has 
been omitted from most previous policy analyses. Future policy analyses and 
burden estimates should take better account of post-tuberculosis, to avoid the 
potential misallocation of funding, political attention, and research effort 
resulting from continued neglect of this issue.

BACKGROUND: Tolvaptan (TLV) is effective for acute heart failure (HF) with 
congestion, but its long-term administration in patients with chronic HF (CHF) 
remains controversial. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of TLV for CHF treatment 
has not yet been investigated. Thus, we sought to validate the 
cost-effectiveness of TLV for CHF treatment in Japan.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare total costs, quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between 
long-term TLV strategy and the standard strategy using furosemide for CHF. The 
target population included 75-year-old patients with CHF. The effectiveness of 
the TLV strategy for CHF treatment was determined based on a systematic review 
and meta-analysis. We used a 10-year horizon, with sensitivity analyses for 
significant variables and a scenario analysis for patients with CHF receiving 
high-dose furosemide (≥60 mg per day).
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the total cost of the long-term TLV strategy 
was higher than that of the standard strategy (¥3,243,779 vs. ¥1,179,964). The 
total QALYs of the long-term TLV strategy were lower than those of the standard 
strategy (4.52 vs 4.59). Thus, a standard TLV prescription for CHF treatment has 
no clinical or economic benefit. In the scenario analysis (i.e. in patients with 
CHF receiving high-dose furosemide), the long-term TLV strategy was more 
effective (total QALYs, 5.10 vs. 4.41) but more expensive (total costs, 
¥3,540,558 vs. ¥1,272,208) than the standard strategy. The ICER of the TLV 
strategy against the standard strategy (¥3,289,579/QALY) was below the 
willingness-to-pay of ¥5,000,000, which suggests that the long-term TLV strategy 
is cost-effective relative to the standard strategy in patients with CHF 
receiving high-dose furosemide.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term TLV administration did not provide a clear benefit for 
all patients with CHF. However, this treatment strategy may be a cost-effective 
therapeutic option for patients who require high-dose furosemide.

The purpose of this review was to identify the different augmented reality (AR) 
modalities used to teach anatomy to students, health professional trainees, and 
surgeons, and to examine the assessment tools used to evaluate the performance 
of various AR modalities. A scoping review of four databases was performed using 
variations of: (1) AR, (2) medical or anatomical teaching/education/training, 
and (3) anatomy or radiology or cadaver. Scientific articles were identified and 
screened for the inclusion and exclusion criteria as per Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses with extension for scoping 
reviews guidelines. Virtual reality was an exclusion criterion. From this 
scoping review, data were extracted from a total of 54 articles and the 
following four AR modalities were identified: head-mounted display, projection, 
instrument and screen, and mobile device. The usability, feasibility, and 
acceptability of these AR modalities were evaluated using a variety of 
quantitative and qualitative assessment tools. Within more recent years of AR 
integration into anatomy education, the assessment of visuospatial ability, 
cognitive load, time on task, and increasing academic achievement outcomes are 
variables of interest, which continue to warrant more exploration. Sufficiently 
powered studies using validated assessment tools must be conducted to better 
understand the role of AR in anatomical education.

PURPOSE: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine 
neoplasm, with a rising incidence and a long life expectancy. It has recently 
been suggested that patients with low- and intermediate-risk DTC with a good 
response to treatment at one year could be followed up using only highly 
sensitive immunoassays for thyroglobulin (Tg). The aim of this study was to 
examine the serum Tg levels in a series of DTC patients with histologically 
proven persistent or recurrent diseases.
METHODS: The study involved 50 consecutive patients being routinely followed up 
at our center, whose clinical, histological, and biochemical data were 
retrospectively collected.
RESULTS: The false-negative rate of ultrasensitive serum Tg assay was 14.3% 
(5/35) overall, and limited to anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb)-negative 
patients. Among them, only one patient had an excellent response to treatment at 
one-year follow-up and was diagnosed with a 4 mm recurrence, after more than 
seven years of periodic ultrasounds. The size of the neck lesion documented in 
the histological report was slightly larger in patients with detectable as 
opposed to negative Tg values (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum highly sensitive Tg is undetectable in a proportion of 
patients with a proven persistent or recurrent DTC. The reasons behind this 
phenomenon are still unknown. However, in low/intermediate-risk patients cured 
at one-year follow-up, highly sensitive Tg without neck US seems an appropriate 
strategy for patients' management.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options for children with multiple sclerosis are scarce. 
Teriflunomide is approved in more than 80 countries for the treatment of adults 
with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The TERIKIDS study examined the safety and 
efficacy of teriflunomide in children with relapsing multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: The TERIKIDS trial was a multicentre, phase 3, double-blind, 
parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled study conducted at 57 clinical 
centres in 22 countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and 
North America. The trial enrolled patients aged 10-17 years, diagnosed with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis and with at least one relapse in the year preceding 
screening or at least two relapses in the 2 years preceding screening. Patients 
were randomly assigned (2:1) to oral teriflunomide (dosage equivalent to 14 mg 
in adults) or matching placebo, using an interactive web and voice response 
system, for up to 96 weeks. Personnel in all sites and all patients were masked 
to study treatment in the double-blind period. Early entry into a subsequent 
96-week open-label extension phase was possible before the end of the 
double-blind period for patients with confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI 
activity (at least five new or enlarged T2 lesions at week 24, followed by at 
least nine new or enlarged T2 lesions at week 36, or at least five new or 
enlarged T2 lesions at weeks 36 and 48, or at weeks 48 and 72). The primary 
endpoint was time to first confirmed clinical relapse by the end of the 
double-blind period. Key secondary imaging endpoints were number of new or 
enlarged T2 lesions and number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per MRI scan. 
Efficacy endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, and 
safety was assessed in all patients randomly assigned to treatment and exposed 
to the double-blind study medication. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (trial number NCT02201108) and is closed to recruitment, but 
an additional optional open-label extension is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between July 24, 2014, and the date of last patient visit on Oct 25, 
2019, 185 patients were screened for eligibility, 166 (90%) were enrolled, and 
109 were randomly assigned teriflunomide and 57 were randomly assigned placebo. 
102 (94%) of 109 and 53 (93%) of 57 completed the double-blind period. Switch to 
the ongoing open-label extension because of high MRI activity was more frequent 
than anticipated in the placebo group (14 [13%] of 109 patients in the 
teriflunomide group vs 15 [26%] of 57 in the placebo group), decreasing the 
power of the study. After 96 weeks, there was no difference in time to first 
confirmed clinical relapse with teriflunomide compared with placebo (hazard 
ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·39-1·11; p=0·29). Teriflunomide reduced the number of new 
or enlarged T2 lesions versus placebo by 55% (relative risk 0·45, 95% CI 
0·29-0·71; p=0·00061), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions by 75% 
(relative risk 0·25, 0·13-0·51; p<0·0001). Adverse events occurred in 96 (88%) 
patients in the teriflunomide group and 47 (82%) patients in the placebo group; 
serious adverse events occurred in 12 (11%) patients in the teriflunomide group 
and 6 (11%) patients in the placebo group. Nasopharyngitis, 
upper-respiratory-tract infection, alopecia, paraesthesia, abdominal pain, and 
increased blood creatine phosphokinase were more frequent with teriflunomide 
than with placebo. During the double-blind phase, four patients in the 
teriflunomide group had pancreatic adverse events (two with acute pancreatitis 
and two with pancreatic enzyme elevation), of which three events led to 
treatment discontinuation.
INTERPRETATION: No significant difference in time to first confirmed clinical 
relapse was found, possibly because more patients than expected switched from 
the double-blind to the open-label treatment period because of high MRI 
activity. Key secondary imaging analyses and a prespecified sensitivity analysis 
of probability of relapse or high MRI activity suggest that teriflunomide might 
have beneficial effects in children with relapsing multiple sclerosis by 
reducing the risk of focal inflammatory activity.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between body mass index (BMI [calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) and mortality after 
the first year post spinal cord injury (SCI) overall and across demographic and 
injury characteristics.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Sixteen Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) centers.
PARTICIPANTS: SCIMS Database participants age 20 years or older and having a BMI 
assessment during the 2007-2011 wave of data collection.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality rate. Life table method and log-rank 
test were used to estimate and compare mortality rates across BMI groups and 
other factors. Cox proportional hazard regression model was conducted to 
estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 2346 participants (N=2346) with SCI were classified into 1 
of the 8 BMI groups: <18.5 (6.9%), 18.5-19.9 (7.3%), 20.0-22.49 (15.0%), 
22.5-24.9 (18.8%), 25.0-27.49 (17.5%), 27.5-29.9 (13.2%), 30.0-34.9 (13.5%), and 
≥35.0 (7.8%). Compared with people with BMI of 22.5-29.9, a higher mortality 
risk was observed among people with BMI<18.5 (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.25-2.49), 
18.5-19.9 (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.06-2.15), and ≥35.0 (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.07) 
after adjusting for confounding factors (sex, age at the time of BMI assessment, 
marital status, neurologic status). The U-shape BMI-mortality relationship 
varied by age, sex, neurologic status, and years since injury.
CONCLUSIONS: To improve life expectancy after SCI, health care professionals 
could focus on weight management among patients with relatively low and 
extremely high BMI, defined by demographic and injury-related characteristics. 
Future studies should explore factors that contribute to such a higher mortality 
after SCI, including pre-existing conditions, poor diet and/or nutrition, and 
cardiorespiratory fitness.

OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in causes of death after spinal cord injury (SCI) 
that could enhance understanding of why life expectancy after SCI has not 
improved in the last 3 decades.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Twenty-nine SCI Model Systems and 3 Shriners Hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with traumatic SCI (N=49,266) enrolled in the SCI 
Collaborative Survival Study Database between 1973 and 2017.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-standardized cause-specific SCI mortality rates and 
95% confidence intervals were calculated for 5 time intervals (1960-1979, 
1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2017).
RESULTS: A total of 17,249 deaths occurred in 797,226 person-years of follow-up. 
Since 2010, the highest mortality rate was for respiratory diseases, followed by 
heart disease, cancer, infective and parasitic diseases (primarily septicemia), 
and unintentional injuries. Mortality rates for respiratory diseases, cancer, 
stroke, urinary diseases, and digestive diseases, initially decreased 
significantly but remained relatively stable since 1980, whereas essentially no 
progress occurred for infective and parasitic diseases. Mortality rates for 
heart disease, pulmonary embolus, and suicide decreased significantly throughout 
the entire study period, but were offset by increases in mortality rates for 
endocrine (primarily diabetes), nutritional, and metabolic diseases, as well as 
unintentional injuries. From 2010 to 2017, the overall age-standardized 
mortality rate was 3 times higher for individuals with SCI than the general 
population, ranging from 27% higher for cancer to 9 times higher for infective 
and parasitic diseases.
CONCLUSION: Improving life expectancy after SCI will require: (1) reducing 
mortality rates from respiratory diseases and septicemia that have remained 
high, (2) reversing current trends in diabetes and unintentional injury deaths, 
and (3) continuing to reduce mortality from heart disease and other leading 
causes.

BACKGROUND: In patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), cervical lymph node 
metastasis (LNM) must be carefully assessed to determine the extent of lymph 
node dissection required and patient prognosis. Few studies attempted to 
determine whether the ultrasound (US) appearance of the primary thyroid tumor 
could be used to predict cervical lymph node involvement. This study aimed to 
identify the US features of the tumor that could predict cervical LNM in 
patients with PTC.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with pathologically 
confirmed PTC. We evaluated the following US characteristics: lobe, isthmus, and 
tumor size; tumor position; parenchymal echogenicity; the number of lesions 
(i.e., tumor multifocality); parenchymal and lesional vascularity; tumor margins 
and shape; calcifications; capsular extension; tumor consistency; and the lymph 
nodes along the carotid vessels. The patients were grouped as no LNM (NLNM), 
central LNM (CLNM) alone, and lateral LNM (LLNM) with/without CLNM, according to 
the postoperative pathological examination.
RESULTS: Totally, 247 patients, there were 67 men and 180 women. Tumor size of 
> 10 mm was significantly more common in the CLNM (70.2%) and LLNM groups 
(89.6%) than in the NLNM group (45.4%). At US, capsular extension > 50% was most 
common in the LLNM group (35.4%). The multivariable analysis revealed that age 
(OR = 0.203, 95%CI: 0.095-0.431, P < 0.001) and tumor size (OR = 2.657, 95%CI: 
1.144-6.168, P = 0.023) were independently associated with CLNM compared with 
NLNM. In addition, age (OR = 0.277, 95%CI: 0.127-0.603, P = 0.001), tumor size 
(OR = 6.069, 95%CI: 2.075-17.75, P = 0.001), and capsular extension (OR = 2.09, 
95%CI: 1.326-3.294, P = 0.001) were independently associated with LLNM compared 
with NLNM.
CONCLUSION: Percentage of capsular extension at ultrasound is associated with 
LLNM. US-guided puncture cytology and eluent thyroglobulin examination could be 
performed as appropriate to minimize the missed diagnosis of LNM.

OBJECTIVES: To discuss the associations between habits and environment in 
childhood and cardiovascular effects on adults.
SOURCE OF DATA: Search in PubMed, Scielo and Science databases, cohort or 
case-control studies, and systematic or scope-based reviewson the causal 
relationship among exposures in the pediatric age group and cardiovascular 
effects in adults.
SYNTHESIS OF DATA: The authors identified 41 eligible articles, which 
demonstrated an impact on cardiovascular health (characterized as surrogate 
events - structural or functional vascular alterations or left ventricular 
dysfunction - or clinical events - myocardial infarction, stroke or 
cardiovascular death) with environmental aspects (intrauterine or economically 
poor environment, violence, reduced life expectancy and serious infections) and 
habits (nutrition, physical activity and tobacco exposure). In addition to the 
direct and independent associations between exposures and outcomes, several 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) or family histories are also 
intermediate pathophysiological pathways in the described phenomena.
CONCLUSIONS: There are direct relationships between lifestyle and inadequate 
environments in childhood and cardiovascular effects, although the observed 
associations showed divergences in terms of results and interpretation. In spite 
of these, it is recommended to encourage healthy lifestyles and protection 
against childhood adverse exposures, as habit formation occurs at this age, and 
its relationship with CVRF since childhood has already been well established. On 
the other hand, the format and intensity of the stimulus must respect the 
social, cultural and psychological aspects of each population, aiming to obtain 
the best and most lasting result without generating harmful consequences for the 
individuals.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disorder with 
increasing life expectancy from late teens to over 30 years of age. The aim of 
this nationwide study was to explore the prevalence, life expectancy and leading 
causes of death in patients with DMD in Sweden. Patients with DMD were 
identified through the National Quality Registry for Neuromuscular Diseases in 
Sweden, the Swedish Registry of Respiratory Failure, pathology laboratories, 
neurology and respiratory clinics, and the national network for neuromuscular 
diseases. Age and cause of death were retrieved from the Cause of Death Registry 
and cross-checked with medical records. 373 DMD patients born 1970-2019 were 
identified, of whom 129 patients deceased during the study period. Point 
prevalence of adult patients with DMD on December 31st 2019 was 3.2 per 100,000 
adult males. Birth prevalence was 19.2 per 100,000 male births. Median survival 
was 29.9 years, the leading cause of death being cardiopulmonary in 79.9% of 
patients. Non-cardiopulmonary causes of death (20.1% of patients) mainly 
pertained to injury-related pulmonary embolism (1.3 per 1000 person-years), 
gastrointestinal complications (1.0 per 1000 person-years), stroke (0.6 per 1000 
person-years) and unnatural deaths (1.6 per 1000 person-years). Death from 
non-cardiopulmonary causes occurred at younger ages (mean 21.0 years, SD 8.2; 
p = 0.004). Age at loss of independent ambulation did not have significant 
impact on overall survival (p = 0.26). We found that non-cardiopulmonary causes 
contribute to higher mortality among younger patients with DMD. We present novel 
epidemiological data on the increasing population of adult patients with DMD.

The United States is releasing more individuals from prisons than ever before. 
However, returning citizens face numerous challenges transitioning back into 
community life and many communities remain ill-equipped in successfully 
supporting them. This study focuses on transportation as in integral component 
to the success of returning citizens. Rapid and rigorous qualitative data 
analysis (RADaR technique) is applied to interviews (n = 15) with individuals 
having returned to their community about the impact of transportation on their 
reentry. Analysis resulted in three primary themes; interviewees reinforced 
existing knowledge of the issues with transportation disadvantage, 
transportation is an extension of freedom, and transportation is directly 
connected to reentry success. These findings suggest a tiered structure of 
transportation freedom for returning citizens. This model of transportation will 
aid future researchers and policymakers in considering how to better resource 
returning citizens to maximize their success.

BACKGROUND: Pregnant women, healthcare workers (HW), and adults >= 60 years have 
shown an increased vulnerability to seasonal influenza virus infections and/or 
complications. In 2012, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) initiated 
a national influenza vaccination program for these target groups. A 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of this program was undertaken to inform program 
sustainability.
METHODS: We designed a decision-analytical model and collected influenza-related 
medical resource utilization and cost data, including indirect costs. Model 
inputs were obtained from medical record abstraction, interviews of patients and 
staff at hospitals in the national influenza sentinel surveillance system and/or 
from literature reviews. We compared the annual disease and economic impact of 
influenza illnesses in each of the target groups in Lao PDR under scenarios of 
no vaccination and vaccination, and then estimated the cost-effectiveness of the 
vaccination program. We performed sensitivity analyses to identify influential 
variables.
RESULTS: Overall, the vaccination of pregnant women, HWs, and adults >= 60 years 
could annually save 11,474 doctor visits, 1,961 days of hospitalizations, 
43,027 days of work, and 1,416 life-years due to laboratory-confirmed influenza 
illness. After comparing the total vaccination program costs of 23.4 billion 
Kip, to the 18.4 billion Kip saved through vaccination, we estimated the 
vaccination program to incur a net cost of five billion Kip (599,391 USD) 
annually. The incremental cost per life-year saved (ICER) was 44 million Kip 
(5,295 USD) and 6.9 million Kip (825 USD) for pregnant women and adults >= 
60 years, respectively. However, vaccinating HWs provided societal cost-savings, 
returning 2.88 Kip for every single Kip invested. Influenza vaccine 
effectiveness, attack rate and illness duration were the most influential 
variables to the model.
CONCLUSION: Providing influenza vaccination to HWs in Lao PDR is cost-saving 
while vaccinating pregnant women and adults >= 60 is cost-effective and highly 
cost-effective, respectively, per WHO standards.

CKD: The burden of disease invisible to research funders.

AIRG-E, EKPF, ALCER, FRIAT, REDINREN, RICORS2040, SENEFRO; SET, ONT.

The uptake of the current concept of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by the public, 
physicians and health authorities is low. Physicians still mix up CKD with 
chronic kidney insufficiency or failure. In a recent manuscript, only 23% of 
participants in a cohort of persons with CKD had been diagnosed by their 
physicians as having CKD while 29% has a diagnosis of cancer and 82% had a 
diagnosis of hypertension. For the wider public and health authorities, CKD 
evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 
0.13%. A prevalent view is that for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is 
"solved" by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, the main burden of CKD 
is accelerated aging and all-cause and cardiovascular premature death. CKD is 
the most prevalent risk factor for lethal COVID-19 and the factor that most 
increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Moreover, men and women 
undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality which is 10-100-fold higher than 
similar age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by around 40 years for young 
persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney 
graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth global cause of death by 2040 and the 
second cause of death in Spain before the end of the century, a time when 1 in 4 
Spaniards will have CKD. However, by 2022, CKD will become the only top-15 
global predicted cause of death that is not supported by a dedicated well-funded 
CIBER network research structure in Spain. Leading Spanish kidney researchers 
grouped in the kidney collaborative research network REDINREN have now applied 
for the RICORS call of collaborative research in Spain with the support of the 
Spanish Society of Nephrology, ALCER and ONT: RICORS2040 aims to prevent the 
dire predictions for the global 2040 burden of CKD from becoming true. However, 
only the highest level of research funding through the CIBER will allow to 
adequately address the issue before it is too late.

Publisher: El impacto del concepto actual de enfermedad renal crónica (ERC) en 
la población, médicos y autoridades sanitarias ha sido bajo. Los médicos aún 
confunden la ERC con la insuficiencia renal crónica. En un manuscrito reciente, 
en una cohorte de personas con ERC, solo el 23% de los participantes fueron 
diagnosticados de ERC por sus médicos mientras que el 29% estaban diagnosticados 
de cáncer y el 82% de hipertensión. Para el público en general y las autoridades 
sanitarias, la ERC evoca la terapia de reemplazo renal (TRR). En España, la 
prevalencia de TRR es del 0,13%. La opinión predominante es que para aquellos en 
los que fallan los riñones, el problema se “resuelve” mediante diálisis o 
trasplante de riñón. Sin embargo, la principal carga sanitaria de la ERC es el 
envejecimiento acelerado y la muerte prematura de causa cardiovascular o de 
cualquier causa. La ERC es el factor mas prevalente de riesgo de mortalidad por 
COVID-19 después de la edad avanzada.Además, los hombres y mujeres que se 
someten a TRR todavía tienen una mortalidad anual que es de 10 a 100 veces 
superior a sus pares de edades similares, y la esperanza de vida se reduce en 
alrededor de 40 años para jóvenes en diálisis y en 15 años para jóvenes con un 
injerto renal funcionante.Se espera que la ERC se convierta en la quinta causa 
mundial de muerte para 2040 y la segunda causa de muerte en España antes de fin 
de siglo, época en la que 1 de cada 4 españoles tendrá ERC.Sin embargo, para 
2022, la ERC se convertirá en la única causa de muerte entre las 15 principales 
a nivel mundial que no cuenta con el respaldo de una estructura de investigación 
CIBER en España.Los Principales grupos de investigación renal en España 
agrupados en la red de investigación colaborativa renal REDINREN han solicitado 
la convocatoria RICORS de investigación colaborativa en España con el apoyo de 
la Sociedad Española de Nefrología, ALCER y ONT: RICORS 040 tiene como objetivo 
evitar que se hagan realidad las terribles predicciones sobre la carga mundial 
de ERC para 2040. Sin embargo, solo el más alto nivel de financiación de la 
investigación a través del CIBER permitirá abordar adecuadamente el problema 
antes de que sea demasiado tarde.

Astaxanthin (AXN) is known to have health benefits by epidemiological studies. 
Therefore, it is of interest to assess the effect of AXN (derived from 
indigenous unicellular green alga Haematococcus lacustris) to modulate cell 
cycle arrest, lysosomal acidification and eventually apoptosis using in vitro in 
A549 lung cancer cells. Natural extracts of astaxanthin were obtained by 
standardized methods as reported earlier and characterized by standard HPLC and 
MS. Treatment of A549 cells with AXN (purified fraction) showed significant 
reduction in cell viability (about 50%) as compared to crude extract at 50µM 
concentration. Thus, we show the anticancer effects and lysosomal acidification 
in A549 cells by Astaxanthin from Haematococcus lacustris for further 
consideration. Together, our results demonstrated the anticancer potential of 
AXN from Haematococcus lacustris, which is found to be mediated via its ability 
to induce cell cycle arrest, lysosomal acidification and apoptotic induction.

Breast Cancer in the Elderly: An Observational Study Investigating Compliance of 
Screening Mammography in an Underserved Community.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer increases with age. Individuals 
living in higher socioeconomic communities also have higher incidence secondary 
to early detection of breast cancer from increased accessibility to mammograms. 
This retrospective study studied the percentage of new breast cancer cases in 
the elderly between 2010 and 2019, and investigated the compliance of screening 
mammography in some of the medically underserved suburbs of southern Chicago.
METHODS: The parameters used to power this study include "age greater than 70" 
and "2010 to present" at the time the study was first initiated. The final data 
set contained 381 electronic health records (EMRs) that met the parameters of 
interest. We specifically looked at method of diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, 
date of last normal screening mammogram, hormone status, histology, race, and 
smoking history.
RESULTS: Thirty percent of the breast cancer patients diagnosed at our 
institution were over 70 years of age between 2010 and 2019. Of the 381 patients 
included in the overall sample, 45% were diagnosed with breast cancer by 
screening mammogram, and 52% of individuals in the 70 - 75 age group were 
diagnosed with breast cancer by screening mammography. Only 40% of individuals 
in the 75+ age group were diagnosed with breast cancer by screening mammogram (P 
= 0.0234). Furthermore, in the overall sample, 63% had a normal screening 
mammogram at some time prior to their breast cancer diagnosis. In the 70 - 75 
age group, 76% had a normal screening mammogram at some time prior to their 
breast cancer diagnosis. In the 75+ age group, only 54% had a normal screening 
mammogram at some time prior to their breast cancer diagnosis (P < 0.0001). 
Individuals in both age groups were more likely to have early-stage breast 
cancers and luminal A hormone expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased compliance to screening mammography is observed in the 
elderly living in underserved communities. Since the elderly are 
underrepresented in research, organizations do not have sufficient information 
to recommend screening mammography in the elderly. With increasing life 
expectancy, observational studies have demonstrated a mortality benefit with 
screening mammography by early detection of breast cancer, favorable breast 
cancer characteristics and potentially higher cure rates. Socioeconomic factors 
also affect screening compliance and likely influenced the results of our study. 
Future studies should investigate how individual factors influence screening 
mammography compliance in the elderly in underserved communities.

INTRODUCTION: non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of 
mortality and disability worldwide especially in developing countries such as 
Tunisia. We aimed to describe the national burden of non-communicable diseases 
in 2017 and to analyze disability-adjusted life year trends from 1990 to 2017 in 
Tunisia by cause and gender.
METHODS: we used Joinpoint regression analysis to assess trends of the age 
standardized disability-adjusted life year rate from 1990 to 2017 and to 
determine average annual percentage change.
RESULTS: non-communicable diseases accounted for 87.7% of total 
disability-adjusted life year in Tunisia in 2017. The five leading causes of 
this rate in Tunisia in 2017 were cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal 
disorders, neoplasms, mental disorders and neurological disorders. The trend of 
disability-adjusted life year rate of non-communicable diseases decreased 
significantly from 23403.2 per 100.000 (95% CI: 20830.2-26285.8) in 1990 to 
18454.6 (95% CI: 15611.3-21555.4) in 2017, with a change of -0.9%; p=0.00. The 
decrease of the age standardized disability-adjusted life year rate concerned 
mainly cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms secondly. This decrease was more 
important in female (change=-1.1, p=0.00) in comparison to males (change=-0.7,
