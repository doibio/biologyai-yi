COCKAYNE SYNDROME: ROLE OF GENETIC COUNSELLING.

Padmalayam P, Balan P, Sapkal R.

Cockayne's Syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
deficiency in the transcription-couple DNA repair pathway caused by mutations in 
the genes ERCC6 in 65% of individuals and ERCC8 in 35% of individuals. Here we 
report a rare case of Cockayne's syndrome in a girl who presented with hallmark 
features specific to the syndrome. Dissemination of our knowledge about clinical 
manifestations encountered in Cockayne syndrome is instrumental not only for 
early evaluation and treatment to prolong life expectancy, but also to initiate 
early genetic counselling with parents concerning future pregnancies.

Our vision of long-term treatment strategies for the prevention of target organ 
damage and eventually cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in essential 
arterial hypertension needs to be continually monitored and updated for at least 
three issues: 1--the achievement of target pressure required to obtain the 
expected benefit needs continuous monitoring, a dose adjustment of the drug and, 
often, the use of combination therapies; 2--the chronic use of certain drugs, 
even in combination, is associated with the possible onset of side effects; 
3--increasing of population life expectancy is inevitably associated with in an 
increase in drugs use with the unavoidable occurrence of adverse drug reactions, 
some of which can interfere with blood pressure control. These issues, still 
poorly studied, pose considerable problems in applying proper strategies for 
prevention. In this review, we will evaluate the goals of antihypertensive 
therapy, and its weak spots, such as the frequent side effects, that lead to 
poor therapy compliance. Moreover, we will review the interactions between 
antihypertensive and drugs used for other common disease, and their importance 
in not achieving the expected blood pressure reduction.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of diabetes status on healthy and disabled 
years of life for older adults in the U.S. and provide a baseline from which to 
evaluate ongoing national public health efforts to prevent and control diabetes 
and disability.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults (n = 20,008) aged 50 years and older were 
followed from 1998 to 2012 in the Health and Retirement Study, a prospective 
biannual survey of a nationally representative sample of adults. Diabetes and 
disability status (defined by mobility loss, difficulty with instrumental 
activities of daily living [IADL], and/or difficulty with activities of daily 
living [ADL]) were self-reported. We estimated incidence of disability, 
remission to nondisability, and mortality. We developed a discrete-time Markov 
simulation model with a 1-year transition cycle to predict and compare lifetime 
disability-related outcomes between people with and without diabetes. Data 
represent the U.S. population in 1998.
RESULTS: From age 50 years, adults with diabetes died 4.6 years earlier, 
developed disability 6-7 years earlier, and spent about 1-2 more years in a 
disabled state than adults without diabetes. With increasing baseline age, 
diabetes was associated with significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the number of 
total and disability-free life-years, but the absolute difference in years 
between those with and without diabetes was less than at younger baseline age. 
Men with diabetes spent about twice as many of their remaining years disabled 
(20-24% of remaining life across the three disability definitions) as men 
without diabetes (12-16% of remaining life across the three disability 
definitions). Similar associations between diabetes status and disability-free 
and disabled years were observed among women.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is associated with a substantial reduction in nondisabled 
years, to a greater extent than the reduction of longevity.

Introduction Due to increased life expectancy among the population, studying the 
vocal parameters of the elderly is key to promoting vocal health in old age. 
Objective This study aims to analyze the profile of the extension of speech of 
elderly female choristers, according to age group. Method The study counted on 
the participation of 25 elderly female choristers from the Choir of Messianic 
Church of São Paulo, with ages varying between 63 and 82 years, and an average 
of 71 years (standard deviation of 5.22). The elders were divided into two 
groups: G1 aged 63 to 71 years and G2 aged 72 to 82. We asked that each 
participant count from 20 to 30 in weak, medium, strong, and very strong 
intensities. Their speech was registered by the software Vocalgrama that allows 
the evaluation of the profile of speech range. We then submitted the parameters 
of frequency and intensity to descriptive analysis, both in minimum and maximum 
levels, and range of spoken voice. Results The average of minimum and maximum 
frequencies were respectively 134.82-349.96 Hz for G1 and 137.28-348.59 Hz for 
G2; the average for minimum and maximum intensities were respectively 
40.28-95.50 dB for G1 and 40.63-94.35 dB for G2; the vocal range used in speech 
was 215.14 Hz for G1 and 211.30 Hz for G2. Conclusion The minimum and maximum 
frequencies, maximum intensity, and vocal range presented differences in favor 
of the younger elder group.

Chemotherapy in Elderly Patients with Gastric Cancer.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most frequent malignant diseases in the 
elderly. Systemic chemotherapy showed an improvement of quality of life and 
survival benefit compared to supportive care alone in patients with advanced GC. 
Because comorbidities or age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics may lead to higher toxicity, however, many oncologists hesitate 
to recommend elderly patients to receive chemotherapy. Available data suggest 
that elderly patients with GC are able to tolerate and benefit from systemic 
chemotherapy to the same extent as younger patients. The age alone should not be 
the only criteria to preclude effective chemotherapy. However, proper patient 
selection is extremely important to deliver effective treatment safely. A 
comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a useful method to assess life 
expectancy and risk of morbidity in older patients and to guide providing 
optimal treatment. Treatment should be personalized based on the nature of the 
disease, the life expectancy, the risk of complication, and the patient's 
preference. Combination chemotherapy can be considered for older patients with 
metastatic GC who are classified as non-frail patients by CGA. For frail or 
vulnerable patients, however, monotherapy or only symptomatic treatment may be 
desirable. Targeted agents seem to be promising treatment options for elderly 
patients with GC considering their better efficacy and less toxicity.

Incidental renal lesions are relatively common in daily radiological practice. 
It is important to know the different diagnostic possibilities for incidentally 
detected lesions, depending on whether they are cystic or solid. The management 
of cystic lesions is guided by the Bosniak classification. In solid lesions, the 
goal is to differentiate between renal cancer and benign tumors such as fat-poor 
angiomyolipoma and oncocytoma. Radiologists need to know the recommendations for 
the management of these lesions and the usefulness of the different imaging 
techniques and interventional procedures in function of the characteristics of 
the incidental lesion and the patient's life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the most important vector-borne diseases worldwide, 
and annually, nearly 390 million people are infected and 500,000 patients are 
hospitalized for severe dengue. Argentina has great variability in the risk of 
dengue transmission due to eco-climatic reasons. Currently no vaccines are 
available for dengue even though several vaccines are under development.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a 
dengue vaccine in a country with heterogeneous risk of dengue transmission like 
Argentina.
METHODS: The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective using a Markov 
model that included both vaccine and disease parameters. Utility was measured as 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the vaccination was expressed in 2014 
American dollars (US$) per DALY averted. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainty in model outcomes, and a 
threshold analysis was conducted to estimate the highest possible price of the 
vaccine.
RESULTS: The ICER of the vaccination program was found to be US$ 5714 per DALY 
averted. This value is lower than 3 times the per capita GDP of Argentina (US$ 
38,619 in 2014); 54.9% of the simulations were below this value. If a 
vaccination program would be implemented the maximum vaccine price per dose has 
to be US$1.49 for a vaccination at national level or US$28.72 for a targeted 
vaccination in high transmission areas.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that vaccination against dengue would be 
cost-effective in Argentina, especially if carried out in predetermined regions 
at high risk of dengue transmission. However, these results should be 
interpreted with caution because the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
that there was considerable uncertainty around the ICER value. The influence of 
variations in vaccine efficacy, cost and other important parameters are 
discussed in the text.

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgical resection (S) and 
Cesium-131 (Cs-131) [S + Cs-131] intraoperative brachytherapy versus S and 
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) [S + SRS] for the treatment of brain metastases. 
Treatment records as well as hospital and outpatient charts of 49 patients with 
brain metastases between 2008 and 2012 who underwent S + Cs-131 (n = 24) and 
S + SRS (n = 25) were retrospectively reviewed. Hospital charges were compared 
for the single treatment in question. Means and curves of survival time were 
defined by the Kaplan-Meier estimator, with the cost analysis focusing on the 
time period of the relevant treatment. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) and 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for each treatment 
option as a measure of cost-effectiveness. The direct hospital costs of 
treatments per patient were: S + Cs131 = $19,271 and S + SRS = $44,219. The 
median survival times of S + Cs-131 and S + SRS were 15.5 and 11.3 months, and 
the 12 month survival rates were 61 % and 49 % (P = 0.137). The QALY for S + SRS 
when compared to S + Cs-131 yielded a p < 0.0001, making it significantly more 
cost-effective. The ICER also revealed that when compared to S + Cs-131, S + SRS 
was significantly inferior (p < 0.0001). S + Cs-131 is more cost-effective 
compared with S + SRS based on hospital charges as well as QALYs and ICER. Cost 
effectiveness, in addition to efficacy and risk, should factor into the 
comparison between these two treatment modalities for patients with surgically 
resectable brain metastases.

A Cost-Effectiveness Comparison Between Open Transforaminal and Minimally 
Invasive Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusions Using the Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio at 2-Year Follow-up.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

BACKGROUND: Direct cost comparisons between minimally invasive spine surgeries 
and the open options are rare.
OBJECTIVE: To compare healthcare costs associated with open transforaminal 
lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody 
fusion (LLIF) by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
to calculate the thresholds for minimum clinically important difference and 
minimum cost-effective difference for patient-reported outcome measures at the 
2-year follow-up.
METHODS: Forty-five patients who underwent single-level TLIF and 29 patients who 
underwent single-level stand-alone LLIF were included in the comparison. All 
costs from diagnosis through the 2-year follow-up were available from a 
comprehensive single-center data bank within a unified hospital system. Payment 
provided for all spine-related medical resource use from the time of diagnosis 
through 2 years was recorded. A 0% discount rate was applied. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQol-5D collected in an unbiased 
manner. Difference in total cost per QALY gained for LLIF minus that for TLIF 
was assessed as the estimate of the ICER from a US perspective.
RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed at the 2-year follow-up for both 
TLIF and LLIF with the Short Form-36 physical component summary, Oswestry 
Disability Index, visual analog scale back pain and leg pain scores, and 
EuroQol-5D. ICER calculations revealed similar mean cumulative QALYs gained at 
the 2-year interval (0.67 for TLIF and 0.60 for LLIF; P = .33). Median total 
costs of care after TLIF and LLIF were $44 068 and $45 574, respectively (P = 
.96). Minimum cost-effective difference thresholds with an anchor of <$50 000 
per QALY were higher than minimum clinically important difference thresholds for 
all patient-reported outcome measures. Total mean cost and EuroQol-5D were 
statistically equivalent between the 2 treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: TLIF and LLIF produced equivalent 2-year patient outcomes at an 
equivalent cost-effectiveness profile.

Mortality in the United States, 2014.

Murphy SL, Kochanek KD, Xu J, Arias E.

This report presents 2014 U.S. final mortality data on deaths and death rates by 
demographic and medical characteristics. These data provide information on 
mortality patterns among U.S. residents by such variables as sex, race and 
ethnicity, and cause of death. Information on mortality patterns is key to 
understanding changes in the health and well-being of the U.S. population. Life 
expectancy estimates, age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity and sex, 
the 10 leading causes of death, and the 10 leading causes of infant death were 
analyzed by comparing 2014 final data with 2013 final data.

Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
colorectal cancer screening interventions with their effects on health disparity 
being considered.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov cohort simulation was conducted with the 
cycle/duration of 1/40 year(s). Data came from the results of randomized trials 
and others. Participants were hypothetical cohorts aged 50 years as of year 2013 
in 16 Korean provinces. The interventions until the age of 80 were annual 
organized fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (standard screening), annual FOBT with 
basic reminders for provinces with higher mortalities than the national average 
(targeted reminder) and annual FOBT with basic/enhanced reminders for all 
provinces (universal reminder 1 and 2). The comparison was non-screening, the 
outcome was quality-adjusted life years, and only medical costs for screening 
and treatment were considered from a societal perspective. The Atkinson 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (Atkinson ICER), the incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio adjusted by the Atkinson Inequality Index, was used to 
evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four interventions with their impacts on 
regional health disparity being considered.
RESULTS: Health disparity was smallest (or greatest) in non-screening (or the 
standard screening). The targeted reminder had smaller health disparity, and 
smaller Atkinson ICER with respect to standard screening, than did the universal 
reminder 1 and 2.
CONCLUSION: The targeted reminder might be more cost effective than the 
universal reminders with their effects on health disparity being considered. 
This study helps to develop promotional effort for colorectal cancer screening 
with both the greatest cost effectiveness and the smallest health disparity.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of the most disabling conditions associated with old 
age. With increasing life expectancy, prevalence of both dementia and diabetes 
is rising. The complex pathological relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and dementia has been studied, but is not yet fully understood.
AIMS: The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between metabolic parameters and the cognitive function in older diabetics.
METHODS: A total number of 360 diabetic subjects, age 65 years and over, and 300 
older people controls were included. Clinical and biological parameters, 
together with the cognitive function, were assessed every 6 months over a 
18-month period, for each study participant.
RESULTS: By employing a multivariate linear regression analysis, several 
significant relationships have been identified: between Clock Drawing Test (CDT) 
scores and HbA1c (R 2 = 0.68); between CDT scores (R 2 = 0.51) and overall MMSE 
scores (R 2 = 0.43) on one hand, and DM duration in years, on the other hand; 
also between CDT scores and BMI (R 2 = 0.59). There was no significant 
association between fasting serum glucose (FSG), total serum cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol or triglycerides levels and cognitive function scores (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The close detailed monitoring of the cognitive function and a 
rigorous metabolic control are important, especially in the very early stages of 
DM. Addressing factors such as weight control in older diabetic patients could 
contribute to better cognitive outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondria play essential biological functions including the 
synthesis and trafficking of porphyrins and iron/sulfur clusters (ISC), 
processes that in mammals involve the mitochondrial ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) 
transporters ABCB6 and ABCB7, respectively. The mitochondrion of pathogenic 
protozoan parasites such as Leishmania is a promising goal for new therapeutic 
approaches. Leishmania infects human macrophages producing the neglected 
tropical disease known as leishmaniasis. Like most trypanosomatid parasites, 
Leishmania is auxotrophous for heme and must acquire porphyrins from the host.
METHODS: LmABCB3, a new Leishmania major protein with significant sequence 
similarity to human ABCB6/ABCB7, was identified and characterized using 
bioinformatic tools. Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine its cellular 
localization, and its level of expression was modulated by molecular genetic 
techniques. Intracellular in vitro assays were used to demonstrate its role in 
amastigotes replication, and an in vivo mouse model was used to analyze its role 
in virulence. Functional characterization of LmABCB3 was carried out in 
Leishmania promastigotes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural analysis of 
LmABCB3 was performed using molecular modeling software.
RESULTS: LmABCB3 is an atypical ABC half-transporter that has a unique 
N-terminal extension not found in any other known ABC protein. This extension is 
required to target LmABCB3 to the mitochondrion and includes a potential 
metal-binding domain. We have shown that LmABCB3 interacts with porphyrins and 
is required for the mitochondrial synthesis of heme from a host precursor. We 
also present data supporting a role for LmABCB3 in the biogenesis of cytosolic 
ISC, essential cofactors for cell viability in all three kingdoms of life. 
LmABCB3 fully complemented the severe growth defect shown in yeast lacking ATM1, 
an orthologue of human ABCB7 involved in exporting from the mitochondria a 
gluthatione-containing compound required for the generation of cytosolic ISC. 
Indeed, docking analyzes performed with a LmABCB3 structural model using 
trypanothione, the main thiol in this parasite, as a ligand showed how both, 
LmABCB3 and yeast ATM1, contain a similar thiol-binding pocket. Additionally, we 
show solid evidence suggesting that LmABCB3 is an essential gene as dominant 
negative inhibition of LmABCB3 is lethal for the parasite. Moreover, the 
abrogation of only one allele of the gene did not impede promastigote growth in 
axenic culture but prevented the replication of intracellular amastigotes and 
the virulence of the parasites in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether our results present the previously undescribed LmABCB3 
as an unusual mitochondrial ABC transporter essential for Leishmania survival 
through its role in the generation of heme and cytosolic ISC. Hence, LmABCB3 
could represent a novel target to combat leishmaniasis.

PURPOSE: Information is limited on the early postoperative rehabilitation 
following hysterectomy. Our purpose was to evaluate the different perioperative 
modalities of fatigue, pain, quality of life, and physical performance and their 
time-related.
METHODS: A prospective, follow-up study of a cohort of women undergoing 
abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy at the Gynecology Department at Herning 
Hospital, Denmark. Data from 108 women with elective hysterectomy were compared 
pre- and postoperatively. The fatigue level was scored on a visual analogue 
scale and SF-36. Objective measurements were performed by dynamometer of hand 
grip, knee extension strength, and postural stability; further, by ergometer 
cycle work capacity and by impedance lean body mass. Quality of life was 
assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. Patients were examined preoperatively 
and twice postoperatively.
RESULTS: Women lost lean body mass 13 and 30 days after their hysterectomy 
(p < 0.01). Strength in hand (p < 0.05) and knees (p < 0.01) increased compared 
to preoperative values but no change in postural stability and work capacity was 
noted. Fatigue resumed to preoperative levels after 30 days. SF-36 revealed that 
the modality of 'physical functioning' and 'role limitations due to physical 
problems' remained significantly decreased at the end of the study (p < 0.01) 
CONCLUSION: Hysterectomy was associated with reduction in physical function 
assessed by SF-36 30 days after surgery. No impairment of performance was found 
in physical tests at days 13 and 30 postoperatively.

OBJECTIVES: Accurate diagnosis of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is 
critical in thunderclap headache patients due to high morbidity and mortality 
associated with missed aneurysmal bleeds. The objective of this study was to 
determine the utility of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in managing 
patients with acute, severe headaches and negative noncontrast CT and assess the 
cost-effectiveness of three different screening strategies-no follow up, CTA, 
and lumbar puncture (LP).
METHODS: A modeling-based economic evaluation was performed with a time horizon 
of 1 year for thunderclap headache patients in the emergency department with 
negative noncontrast CT for SAH. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
determine the effect of sensitivity of CT and the prevalence of SAH on 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Lumbar puncture follow-up has the lowest cost and the highest utility 
in the mathematical model. The Monte Carlo simulation shows noncontrast CT with 
LP follow-up to be the most cost-effective strategy in 85.3% of all cases even 
at a $1 million/quality-adjusted life-years willingness-to-pay. Sensitivity 
analyses demonstrate that LP follow-up should be performed, except for when CT 
sensitivity exceeds 99.2% and the SAH prevalence is below 3.2%, where no 
follow-up may be considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Although CTA is frequently used for evaluation of thunderclap 
headache patients, its utility is not clearly defined. LP follow-up is shown to 
be the most cost-effective strategy for evaluation of thunderclap headache 
patients in most clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: The importance of increasing adolescence girl's level of physical 
activity is recognized as a priority for having a healthy lifestyle. However, 
adolescent girls especially Iranian, are at high risk for physical inactivity. 
Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is a successful theory to explain physical 
activity behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of 
physical activity based on the SCT.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 adolescent girls 
(15-16 yr old) in Tehran, Iran (2013). The participants were randomly chosen 
with multistage sampling. The SCT constructs consisted of self-efficacy, 
self-regulation, social support, outcome expectancy, and self-efficacy to 
overcoming impediments. Statistical analysis was carried out applying SPSS: 16, 
LISREL 8.8. Stepwise regression was used to test predictors of behavior. Pearson 
correlation was assessed.
RESULTS: Self efficacy to overcoming impediments was the main construct to 
predict physical activity (Beta=0.37). Other determinants were self-efficacy 
(Beta=0.29), family support (beta=0.14), outcome expectancy (beta=0.13), friend 
support (beta=0.12), and self-regulation (beta=0.11), respectively. In general, 
the SCT questionnaire determined 0.85 variation of physical activity behavior. 
All of the constructs had direct significant relation to physical activity 
behavior (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The constructs of SCT provide a suitable framework to perform 
promoting physical activity programs and self-efficacy to overcoming impediments 
and self-efficacy are the best predictors of physical activity in adolescent 
girls.

BACKGROUND: There is a broad consensus among health policy-makers that smoking 
has a significant impact on both heath system and society. The purpose of this 
study was to estimate the economic burden of major cancer deaths caused by 
smoking in Iran in 2012.
METHODS: Number of major cancer deaths due to smoking by sex and age groups in 
2012 was obtained from GLOBCAN database. The life expectancy and retirement age 
were used to estimate years of potential life lost (YPLL) and cost of productive 
lost attributable to smoking, respectively. Data on prevalence of smoking, 
relative risk of smoking, life expectancy table, annual wage and employment rate 
were extracted from the various resources such as previous studies, WHO database 
and Iranian statistic centers. The data analysis was conducted by Excel 
software.
RESULTS: Smoking was responsible for 4,623 cancer deaths, 80808 YPLL and $US 
83,019,583 cost of productivity lost. Lung cancer accounts for largest 
proportion of total cancer deaths, YPLL and cost of productivity lost 
attributable to smoking. Males account for 86.6% of cancer deaths, 82.6% of YPLL 
and 85.3% of cost of productivity lost caused by smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking places a high economic burden on health system and society 
as a whole. In addition, if no one had been smokers in Iran, approximately two 
out of ten cancer deaths could be prevented.

Presently, linaclotide is the only EMA-approved therapy indicated for the 
treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). This study 
sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of linaclotide compared to 
antidepressants for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe IBS-C who 
have previously received antispasmodics and/or laxatives. A Markov model was 
created to estimate costs and QALYs over a 5-year time horizon from the 
perspective of NHS Scotland. Health states were based on treatment satisfaction 
(satisfied, moderately satisfied, not satisfied) and mortality. Transition 
probabilities were based on satisfaction data from the linaclotide pivotal 
studies and Scottish general all-cause mortality statistics. Treatment costs 
were calculated from the British National Formulary. NHS resource use and 
disease-related costs for each health state were estimated from Scottish 
clinician interviews in combination with NHS Reference costs. Quality of life 
was based on EQ-5D data collected from the pivotal studies. Costs and QALYs were 
discounted at 3.5 % per annum. Uncertainty was explored through extensive 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Over a 5-year time 
horizon, the additional costs and QALYs generated with linaclotide were £659 and 
0.089, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £7370 per QALY 
versus antidepressants. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the 
likelihood that linaclotide was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of 
£20,000 per QALY was 73 %. Linaclotide can be a cost-effective treatment for 
adults with moderate-to-severe IBS-C who have previously received antispasmodics 
and/or laxatives in Scotland.

OBJECTIVES: Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a biventricular pacemaker 
(CRT-P) is an effective treatment for dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF). Adding 
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-D) may further reduce the risk of 
sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, if the majority of patients do not require 
shock therapy, the cost-effectiveness ratio of CRT-D compared to CRT-P may be 
high. The objective of this study was to systematically review decision models 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of CRT-D for patients with DHF, compare the 
structure and inputs of these models and identify the main factors influencing 
the ICERs for CRT-D.
METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy of Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and 
EconLit identified eight cost-effectiveness models evaluating CRT-D against 
optimal pharmacological therapy (OPT) and/or CRT-P.
RESULTS: The selected economic studies differed in terms of model structure, 
treatment path, time horizons, and sources of efficacy data. CRT-D was found 
cost-effective when compared to OPT but its cost-effectiveness became 
questionable when compared to CRT-P.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of CRT-D may increase depending on improvement 
of all-cause mortality rates and HF mortality rates in patients who receive 
CRT-D, costs of the device, and battery life. In particular, future studies need 
to investigate longer-term mortality rates and identify CRT-P patients that will 
gain the most, in terms of life expectancy, from being treated with a CRT-D.

Economic Evaluation of Concise Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and/or 
Pharmacotherapy for Depressive and Anxiety Disorders.

Akker-van Marle ME.

BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety disorders cause great suffering and 
disability and are associated with high health care costs. In a previous 
conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we have shown that a concise 
format of cognitive behavioural- and/or pharmacotherapy is as effective as 
standard care in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and in improving 
subdomains of general health and quality of life in secondary care psychiatric 
outpatients.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: In this economic evaluation, we examined whether a favourable 
cost-utility of concise care compared to standard care was attained.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was performed alongside a pragmatic randomised 
controlled trial. Health-related quality of life was measured using the 
Short-Form (SF-36) questionnaire. Cost of healthcare utilization and 
productivity loss (absenteeism and presenteeism) were assessed using the 
Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness 
(TiC-P). A cost-utility analysis, using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, 
comparing differences in societal costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) 
at 1 year was performed.
RESULTS: One year after study entry, the difference in mean cost per patient of 
the two primary treatments was not significant between both groups. No 
significant differences in other healthcare and non- healthcare costs could be 
detected between patients receiving concise care and standard care. Also, QALYs 
were not statistically different between the groups during the study period. 
From both the societal and healthcare perspective, the probability that concise 
care is more cost-effective compared to standard care remains below the turning 
point of 0.5 for all acceptable values of the willingness to pay for a QALY. The 
economic evaluation suggests that concise care is unlikely to be cost-effective 
compared to standard care in the treatment for depressive- and anxiety disorders 
in secondary mental health care during a one year follow up period.
DISCUSSION: Total costs and QALYs were not significantly different between 
standard and concise care, with no evidence for cost-effectiveness of concise 
care in the first year. The longer impact of concise care for patients with mild 
to moderate symptoms of depressive and/or anxiety disorders compared to standard 
care in secondary care needs to be further studied.
IMPLICATIONS: This economic evaluation failed to find significant differences in 
cost between concise and standard care over the study period of one year. 
Replication of our economic evaluation might benefit from an extended follow-up 
period and strict adherence to the study protocol. If concise care will be found 
to be cost-effective in the long term, this would have major implications for 
recommendations how to optimize secondary mental health care in the treatment of 
depressive -- and anxiety disorders.

Exploring why Costa Rica outperforms the United States in life expectancy: A 
tale of two inequality gradients.

Mortality in the United States is 18% higher than in Costa Rica among adult men 
and 10% higher among middle-aged women, despite the several times higher income 
and health expenditures of the United States. This comparison simultaneously 
shows the potential for substantially lowering mortality in other middle-income 
countries and highlights the United States' poor health performance. The United 
States' underperformance is strongly linked to its much steeper socioeconomic 
(SES) gradients in health. Although the highest SES quartile in the United 
States has better mortality than the highest quartile in Costa Rica, US 
mortality in its lowest quartile is markedly worse than in Costa Rica's lowest 
quartile, providing powerful evidence that the US health inequality patterns are 
not inevitable. High SES-mortality gradients in the United States are apparent 
in all broad cause-of-death groups, but Costa Rica's overall mortality advantage 
can be explained largely by two causes of death: lung cancer and heart disease. 
Lung cancer mortality in the United States is four times higher among men and 
six times higher among women compared with Costa Rica. Mortality by heart 
disease is 54% and 12% higher in the United States than in Costa Rica for men 
and women, respectively. SES gradients for heart disease and diabetes mortality 
are also much steeper in the United States. These patterns may be partly 
explained by much steeper SES gradients in the United States compared with Costa 
Rica for behavioral and medical risk factors such as smoking, obesity, lack of 
health insurance, and uncontrolled dysglycemia and hypertension.

Infirmary, West Yorkshire LS1 3EX, United Kingdom.

Coronary heart disease is the single largest cause of death in developed 
countries. Guidelines exist for the management of acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI), yet despite these, significant inequalities exist in the care of these 
patients. The elderly, deprived socioeconomic groups, females and non-caucasians 
are the patient populations where practice tends to deviate more frequently from 
the evidence base. Elderly patients often had higher mortality rates after 
having an AMI compared to younger patients. They also tended to present with 
symptoms that were not entirely consistent with an AMI, thus partially 
contributing to the inequalities in care that is seen between younger and older 
patients. Furthermore the lack of guidelines in the elderly age group presenting 
with AMI can often make decision making challenging and may account for the 
discrepancies in care that are prevalent between younger and older patients. 
Other patients such as those from a lower socioeconomic group, i.e., low income 
and less than high school education often had poorer health and reduced life 
expectancy compared to patients from a higher socioeconomic group after an AMI. 
Lower socioeconomic status was also seen to be contributing to racial and 
geographical variation is the care in AMI patients. Females with an AMI were 
treated less aggressively and had poorer outcomes when compared to males. 
However even when females were treated in the same way they continued to have 
higher in hospital mortality which suggests that gender may well account for 
differences in outcomes. The purpose of this review is to identify the 
inequalities in care for patients who present with an AMI and explore potential 
reasons for why these occur. Greater attention to the management and a better 
understanding of the root causes of these inequalities in care may help to 
reduce morbidity and mortality rates associated with AMI.

Only few reports of surgical approach to T4 lung carcinoma invading the heart 
have been reported in the medical literature. It is also controversial if such 
cancer should be treated by surgery. The aim of this review is to assess the 
current risk/benefit ratio of the surgical management of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) invading the left atrium, especially in the light of a 
multidisciplinary approach. We also expose our surgical experience and the 
procedure we have developed in order to increase our rate of complete resection 
as this criterion appears to be mandatory as well as patients' nodal status in 
order to increase life expectancy.
