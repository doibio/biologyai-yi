AIM: To evaluate a web-based tool for estimating and explaining three scenarios 
for expected survival time to people with advanced cancer (patients), their 
family members (FMs), and other healthcare professionals (HCPs).
METHODS: Thirty-three oncologists estimated the "median survival of a group of 
similar patients" for patients seeking quantitative prognostic information. The 
web-based tool generated worst-case, most likely, and best-case scenarios for 
survival based on the oncologist's estimate. Oncologists presented the scenarios 
to each patient and provided a printed summary to patients, FMs, and HCPs. 
Attitudes to the information were assessed by questionnaires. Observed survival 
for each patient was compared with the oncologist's estimated survival and the 
three scenarios.
RESULTS: Prognosis was discussed with 222 patients: median age 67 years; 61% 
male; most common primary sites pancreas 15%, non-small-cell lung 15%, and 
colorectal 12%. The median (range) for observed survival times was 9 months 
(0.5-43) and for oncologist's estimated survival times was 12 months (2-96). 
Ninety-one percent of patients, 91% of FMs, and 84% of HCPs agreed that it was 
helpful having life expectancy explained as three scenarios. The majority (77%) 
of patients judged the information presented about their life expectancy to be 
the same or better than they had expected before the consultation. The survival 
estimates met a priori criteria for calibration, precision, and accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients, FMs, and HCPs found it helpful to receive personalized 
prognostic information formatted as three scenarios for survival. It was 
feasible, acceptable, and safe to use a web-based resource to do this.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A new gastric cancer screening scoring system (NGCS) 
strategy was recommended for the early gastric cancer (GC) screening process in 
China. The current study aimed to assess the clinical benefits and the cost 
effectiveness of the NGCS strategy in GC high-risk areas of China from a 
societal perspective.
METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model was developed to evaluate 30 alternative 
screening strategies with varying initiation age, including the NGCS strategy, 
the modified NGCS strategy, and the endoscopic screening strategy with various 
screening intervals. The primary outcomes included GC mortality, number of 
endoscopies, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Cost estimates were reported in 2021 USD 
(US$) and both costs and benefits were discounted at 5% annually. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Screening with the NGCS strategy from age 40 years (40-NGCS) reduced 
the GC incidence by 86.4%, which provided the greatest benefit across 
strategies. Compared with all strategies, at a willingness-to pay threshold of 
US$17,922 per QALY, the 40-NGCS strategy was a leading cost-effective strategy, 
with an ICER of US$15,668 per QALY. Results were robust in univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The probability of the 40-NGCS strategy 
being cost effective was 0.863.
CONCLUSIONS: The 40-NGCS strategy was an effective and cost-effective strategy 
to reduce GC incidence and mortality in China. The findings provide important 
evidence for decision makers to formulate and optimize targeted approaches for 
GC prevention and control policies in China.

OBJECTIVE: As the population ages and the survival rate of cancer patients 
increases, long-term management of older adult cancer survivors has become 
important. Subjective life expectancy (SLE) is a concept that refers to an 
individual's particular predicted lifespan, which enables individuals to live an 
active life with hopeful expectations for the extension of a healthy life. 
Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors related to SLE according to 
age group, to help enable middle-aged and older adult cancer survivors to 
actively live out their lives with a sense of control.
DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was used.
METHODS: This study included 538 participants in the fifth to seventh survey 
data of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging dataset. Moreover, we conducted 
multivariable regression analyses.
RESULTS: The participants of this study were 137 middle-aged (under 64 years), 
196 young-old (65-74 years), 164 old-old (75-84 years) and 41 oldest-old (over 
85 years) cancer survivors. The mean age of the participants was 
71.22 ± 9.4 years. The factors related to SLE were employment status (β = 7.43, 
p = 0.018) and quality of life (QOL) (β = 0.25, p = 0.010) for the middle-aged 
group and age (β = -1.50, p = 0.002) and employment status (β = 10.44, 
p = 0.003), and QOL (β = 0.31, p < 0.001) in the young-old group; in the old-old 
group and oldest-old group, the predictors of SLE were QOL (β = 0.35, p = 0.004) 
and social network (β = 2.76, p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: The SLE of middle-aged and older adult cancer survivors was 
different by age group, and related factors also varied by it. Therefore, an 
individual approach for each age group is required to effectively promote SLE.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: By developing and applying differentiated nursing 
interventions suitable for each age group for middle-aged and older adult cancer 
survivors, it should be possible to help them make a healthy transition with 
positive expectations for life extension.

University of Texas Permian Basin, Odessa, Texas, USA.

According to the existing, extensive scientific evidence in the literature, men 
on average are living sicker and dying younger at a higher rate compared to 
women. The causes of men's infirmities are complex and multifaceted, 
contributing to increased morbidity and mortality rates and decreased life 
expectancy. Despite the statistics of the doomed health status among men, 
interests to eliminate their health disparities remain inconsistent and 
ill-defined. Therefore, efforts to eradicate men's health disparities should be 
positioned in interdisciplinary health education, research, and policy using sex 
and gender-based health frameworks. The purpose of this paper is to explore 
men's health generally by discussing common health disparities, the causes of 
the gender gap in men's health outcomes, proposing some strategies for advancing 
men's health, and finally providing nursing implications for education, 
practice, research, and health/public policy. Notably, interdisciplinary, 
gender-based health education potentially has significant impacts on men's 
health. The promotion of such initiatives can consequently address the 
intricacies of men's health, which will provide future healthcare professionals 
with the knowledge, attitude, and skills necessary to improve men's health.

The life expectancy of patients with advanced cancer has been prolonged with the 
development of systemic treatment technology. Spinal metastasis is one of the 
common ways of metastasis of advanced tumors, leading to spinal cord compression 
and compression fractures, which often lead to a significant reduction in 
patients' quality of life and physical function. Therefore, surgical treatment 
is still needed for functional recovery and local control. Separation surgery 
has been known since 2014 when it was purposed. Combined with radiotherapy, it 
can achieve an ideal goal of local control. This paper gives a brief 
introduction to separation surgery, hoping to increase the reader's 
understanding and consider this method in the course of treatment.

Roma, Italy.

BACKGROUND: The outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic 
phase has changed after the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
The life expectancy is actually similar to that of the general population. 
Although outstanding results were achieved, about 20-30% of patients failed to 
achieve molecular milestones or experienced a severe toxicity and needed to 
switch to a second line.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to report on possible future management in 
CML, from dose optimization to avoid long-term off-target events to new agents 
for the treatment of resistant and/or intolerant patients.
METHODS: Broad research on Medline, Embase and archives from EHA and ASH 
congresses was performed.
RESULTS: New TKIs have been developed to counteract resistance and/or 
intolerance in the setting of T315I mutated patients. The benefits of ponatinib 
dose optimization have been recently reported in the OPTIC trial. New trials to 
test the dose optimization are ongoing.
CONCLUSION: Reduction of the standard dose could be performed to reduce the 
specific TKI toxicity. Selective TKIs could be prescribed in the future as third 
line treatment.

Cancer accounts for the high mortality rate and limits the life expectancy of an 
individual. As per the WHO report of 2020, cancer accounts for >10 million 
deaths globally. Scientists are continuously pitching toward the development of 
novel techniques to combat this menace and enhance the efficacy of prevailing 
molecules. In the early phases of the drug development process, >40% of 
promising new therapeutic molecules are hydrophobic. Low aqueous solubility 
results in compromised bioavailability on administration. This limitation is a 
major drawback for the therapeutic use of anticancer drugs. Drug nanocrystals 
(NCs) have sparked a lot of interest in drug delivery. This might be due to 
their excellent physicochemical characteristics like tailored dissolution, high 
drug loading efficiency, extended circulation period, and high structural 
stability. There are 'n' a number of the characteristics that make drug 
nanocrystals a promising formulation for the treatment of cancer. In the last 
few years, many hydrophobic or lipophilic drugs like camptothecin, paclitaxel, 
cyclosporin, busulfan, and thymectacin have been formulated as drug nanocrystals 
against anticancer therapeutics. Various formulation technologies have been 
developed in conjunction with nanocrystal development. This includes top-down 
approaches, bottom-up approaches, as well as combination technology. In this 
article, we will focus on the various manufacturing processes, biological fate 
and therapeutic applications of NCs, and future perspectives in the management 
of cancer.

BACKGROUND: The impact of risk factors (RF) on morbidity and mortality from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) for most Portuguese-speaking countries (PSC) is 
little known.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the morbidity and mortality from CVD 
attributable to RF and its variation, from 1990 to 2019, in PSC, based on 
estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study.
METHODS: We evaluated changes in cardiovascular RF, mortality rates and 
age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 1990 and 2019. 
The correlation between percentage changes in mortality rates and the 
sociodemographic index (SDI) of each PSC was evaluated by the Spearman method. A 
p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the main RF for mortality 
and DALYs for CVD for all PSC. Mortality from CVD showed a downward trend in 
2019, more accentuated in Portugal (-66.6%, 95%CI -71.0 - -61.2) and in Brazil 
(-49.8%, 95%CI -52.5 - -47.1). There was a trend towards an inverse correlation 
between SDI and the percent change in mortality, which was significant for 
dietary risks (r=-0.70, p=0.036), high LDL cholesterol (r=-0.77, p=0.015) and 
high SBP (r=-0.74, p=0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to SBP, dietary and metabolic RF justified a greater 
variation in the burden of CVD correlated with SDI in the PSC, suggesting the 
need to adopt health policies adapted to the reality of each country, aiming to 
reduce their impact on population.

Publisher: FUNDAMENTO: O impacto dos fatores de risco (FR) sobre a 
morbimortalidade por doença cardiovascular (DCV) na maioria dos países de língua 
portuguesa (PLP) é pouco conhecido.
OBJETIVO: Analisar a morbimortalidade por DCV atribuível aos FR e sua variação 
nos PLP de 1990 a 2019, a partir de estimativas do estudo Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2019.
MÉTODOS: Avaliamos as mudanças nos FR ocorridas no período, as taxas de 
mortalidade e os anos de vida perdidos por incapacidade (DALYs), padronizados 
por idade, entre 1990 e 2019. Realizou-se a correlação entre a variação 
percentual das taxas de mortalidade e o índice sociodemográfico (SDI) de cada 
PLP pelo método de Spearman. O valor p<0,05 foi considerado estatisticamente 
significativo.
RESULTADOS: A pressão arterial sistólica (PAS) elevada foi o principal fator de 
risco para mortalidade e DALY por DCV para todos os PLP. A mortalidade por DCV 
mostrou uma tendência de redução em 2019, maior em Portugal (-66,6%, IC95% -71,0 
- -61,2) e no Brasil (-49,8%, IC95% -52,5 - -47,1). Observou-se tendência à 
correlação inversa entre SDI e a variação percentual da mortalidade, que foi 
significativa para os riscos dietéticos (r=-0,70, p=0,036), colesterol LDL 
elevado (r=-0,77, p=0,015) e PAS elevada (r=-0,74, p=0,023).
CONCLUSÕES: Além da PAS, os FR dietéticos e metabólicos justificaram uma maior 
variação da carga de DCV, correlacionada com o SDI nos PLP, sugerindo a 
necessidade de adoção de políticas de saúde adaptadas à realidade de cada país, 
visando a redução de seu impacto sobre a população.

BACKGROUND: Caring for a child with cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging and 
stressful and even more so in a country with limited resources. Our aim was to 
study the impact of CF on the daily life of mothers with children who have CF in 
Tunisia, emphasizing the difficulties encountered.
METHODS: Overall, 20 participants were interviewed about their experiences of 
being caregivers and mothers of children with CF, including their knowledge 
about the condition, their attitude toward it, the impact of CF on their daily 
lives, the main difficulties they had faced, and their concerns and wishes about 
CF management.
RESULTS: The median age of the interviewees was 39 years. None of the mothers 
had known about CF before; 14 of them had difficulty accepting it at first, with 
suicidal thoughts in one case. Six hid the illness from the close family for 
fear of negative prejudices. Three mothers decided to stop having children 
despite availability of prenatal screening. CF also influenced the mothers' 
social activities (n = 13) and interfered with their jobs (n = 5). It was 
responsible for additional expenses in all cases. Chest physiotherapy 
represented a daily source of coping for all participants. Hospitalization 
related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was considered stressful and 
constraining by 12 mothers. The mothers' main concern was the child's life 
expectancy (n = 7). Their main wish was to administer a curative treatment 
(n = 17).
CONCLUSION: CF was found to have deeply affected the mothers' psychosocial life 
stressing the need for the involvement of qualified psychologists and social 
workers together with the medical staff.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate long-term efficacy (percent seizure frequency reduction and 
responder rates), safety, and tolerability of adjunctive cenobamate in an 
open-label extension (OLE) of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study.
METHODS: Patients (aged 18-70 years) with uncontrolled focal seizures despite 
treatment with 1-3 antiseizure medications who completed the 18-week 
double-blind study (n=360) could enter the OLE, where they underwent a 2-week 
blinded conversion to cenobamate (target dose, 300 mg/day; min/max, 50/400 
mg/day).
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in the OLE safety 
population (265 originally randomized to cenobamate, 90 originally randomized to 
placebo), and 354 were included in the OLE modified intent-to-treat population. 
As of July 2019, 58.9% (209/355) of patients were continuing cenobamate 
treatment and 141 had discontinued, including 16.6% (59/355) due to lack of 
efficacy, 8.7% (31/355) due to withdrawal by patient, and 7.6% (27/355) due to 
adverse events. Median (range) duration of OLE exposure was 53.9 (1.1-68.7) 
months. Retention rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 83%, 71%, 65%, and 
62%, respectively. Median percent seizure frequency reduction over baseline 
increased with each 6-month OLE interval, up to 76.1% at months 43-48. Among 
observed patients, 16.4% (36/220) achieved 100% and 39.1% (86/220) achieved ≥90% 
seizure reduction during >36-48 months. Among the initial OLE mITT population, 
10.2% (36/354) of patients achieved 100% and 24.3% (86/354) achieved ≥90% 
seizure reduction during >36-48 months. Similar to the double-blind study, 
adverse events (AEs) included dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, and headache. 
Serious AEs occurred in 20.3% (72/355) of patients.
CONCLUSION: Long-term efficacy, including 100% and ≥90% seizure reduction, was 
sustained during 48 months of cenobamate treatment, with 71% retention at 24 
months. No new safety issues were identified. These results confirm the findings 
of the double-blind study and support the potential long-term clinical benefit 
of cenobamate.
REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01866111.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that oral 
Cenobamate 50-400 mg/day is effective as an adjunctive treatment for the 
long-term management of patients with uncontrolled focal seizures previously 
treated with 1 to 3 ASMs.

The spotted lanternfly (SLF), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), has 
the potential to become a global pest and is currently expanding its range in 
the United States. In this study, we investigated the dispersal patterns of SLF 
in Ailanthus altissima during its oviposition period in South Korea using a 
fluorescent marking system. Oviposition patterns of SLF were then analyzed by 
surveying egg masses in A. altissima patches. The recapture rate of 
fluorescent-marked SLF rapidly decreased to 30% within the first two weeks. 
During the oviposition period, seven cases of among-patch dispersal of SLF 
adults were observed. The minimum distance that SLF could have traveled to 
achieve these among-patch dispersal events ranged from 10 to 1740 m, with most 
events spanning under 60 m. Also, the number of A. altissima trees on which 
fluorescent marked SLF were detected increased until September. Based on the egg 
mass survey, a total of 159 egg masses were detected from 38 out of 247 A. 
altissima trees. Furthermore, 79.2% of egg masses were located < 2.5 m above the 
ground. Finally, a generalized linear mixed model showed that tree height and 
diameter at root collar (DRC) of A. altissima trees had significant effects on 
the number of egg masses.

INTRODUCTION: Levodopa remains the cornerstone treatment for Parkinson's disease 
(PD) but its use is associated with the development of 'wearing-off' 
fluctuations and other motor and non-motor complications over time. Adding a 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor to levodopa/dopa decarboxylase 
(DDC) inhibitor therapy reduces fluctuations in the profile of plasma levodopa 
levels following oral dosing, and can therefore be beneficial for the management 
of motor complications. The objective of the EPSILON study is to investigate the 
efficacy of opicapone (OPC; a third-generation, once-daily COMT inhibitor) in 
enhancing the clinical benefit of levodopa in patients in earlier stages of PD, 
without end-of-dose motor fluctuations.
METHODS: EPSILON is a phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 
and parallel-group study, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OPC as 
add-on to levodopa/DDC inhibitor therapy in patients with early PD who do not 
exhibit signs of motor complications. Eligible patients will be randomised (1:1) 
to receive OPC 50 mg or placebo, in addition to their existing levodopa/DDC 
inhibitor therapy, over a 24-week, double-blind treatment period, after which 
they will have the option of entering an additional 1-year, open-label extension 
period, during which all patients will receive OPC 50 mg.
PLANNED OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy endpoints are change in Movement 
Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III 
total score from baseline to the end of the double-blind period (double-blind 
phase) and change in MDS-UPDRS Part IV total score from open-label baseline to 
the end of the open-label period (open-label phase). Secondary outcomes during 
the double-blind phase will include other measures of PD symptoms, including 
quality of life, non-motor symptoms, and development of motor fluctuations. 
Safety assessments will include evaluation of treatment-emergent adverse events, 
laboratory safety parameters, suicidality and impulse control disorders.

BACKGROUND: The recent WHO data reported that a high treatment gap for 
behavioral illnesses (70%) in low- and- middle-income countries and the 
mortality rate of aggressive behavior reaches up to 32.1 per 100,000 populations 
in the region. However, the magnitude of aggressive behavior is not well stated 
in resource-limited settings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the 
prevalence and determinant factors of aggressive behavior among adults with 
problematic substance use in northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed from January to 
March 2019. A multi-stage cluster sampling method was used to screen a total of 
4028 adults for problematic substance use by using the Cutdown, Annoyed, Guilty, 
and Eye-opener questionnaire (CAGE AID). Finally, 838 participants were positive 
for problematic substance use and interviewed for aggressive behavior using a 
modified overt aggression scale. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used 
to show the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and p-value < 0.05 considered 
statistically significant. A multilevel binary logistic regressions model was 
employed for the hierarchical structure of two-level data for the individual and 
woreda/district levels.
RESULTS: The prevalence of aggressive behavior was found to be 37.9% (301/795, 
95% CI: 34.5, 41.3). Stressful life events (AOR = 2.209, 95 CI; 1.423, 3.429), 
family history of mental illness (AOR = 4.038, 95 CI; 2.046, 7.971), comorbid 
physical illness (AOR = 2.01, 95 CI; 1.332, 3.032) and depressive symptoms 
(AOR = 2.342, 95 CI; 1.686, 3.253) were associated with aggressive behavior 
among individual with problem substance use.
CONCLUSION: Aggressive behavior was found to be high among problematic substance 
uses. An individual with problematic substance use is recommended to be screened 
by health extension workers for aggressive behavior at the community level.

Active chiral viscoelastic materials exhibit elastic responses perpendicular to 
the applied stresses, referred to as odd elasticity. We use a covariant 
formulation of viscoelasticity combined with an entropy production analysis to 
show that odd elasticity is not only present in active systems but also in broad 
classes of passive chiral viscoelastic fluids. In addition, we demonstrate that 
linear viscoelastic chiral solids require activity in order to manifest odd 
elastic responses. To model the phenomenon of passive odd viscoelasticity we 
propose a chiral extension of Jeffreys model. We apply our covariant formalism 
in order to derive the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes and obtain 
clear imprints of odd viscoelastic behavior.

Experiments on reconstituted chromosomes have revealed that mitotic chromosomes 
are assembled even without nucleosomes. When topoisomerase II (topo II) is 
depleted from such reconstituted chromosomes, these chromosomes are not 
disentangled and form "sparklers," where DNA and linker histone are condensed in 
the core and condensin is localized at the periphery. To understand the 
mechanism of the assembly of sparklers, we here take into account the loop 
extrusion by condensin in an extension of the theory of entangled polymer gels. 
The loop extrusion stiffens an entangled DNA network because DNA segments in the 
elastically effective chains are translocated to loops, which are elastically 
ineffective. Our theory predicts that the loop extrusion by condensin drives the 
volume phase transition that collapses a swollen entangled DNA gel because the 
stiffening of the network destabilizes the swollen phase. This may be an 
important piece to understand the mechanism of the assembly of mitotic 
chromosomes.

Drylands, which cover > 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, are dominant drivers 
of global biogeochemical cycling and home to more than one third of the global 
human population. Climate projections predict warming, drought frequency and 
severity, and evaporative demand will increase in drylands at faster rates than 
global means. As a consequence of extreme temperatures and high biological 
dependency on limited water availability, drylands are predicted to be 
exceptionally sensitive to climate change and, indeed, significant climate 
impacts are already being observed. However, our understanding and ability to 
forecast climate change effects on dryland biogeochemistry and ecosystem 
functions lag behind many mesic systems. To improve our capacity to forecast 
ecosystem change, we propose focusing on the controls and consequences of two 
key characteristics affecting dryland biogeochemistry: (1) high spatial and 
temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions and (2) generalized resource 
scarcity. In addition to climate change, drylands are experiencing accelerating 
land-use change. Building our understanding of dryland biogeochemistry in both 
intact and disturbed systems will better equip us to address the interacting 
effects of climate change and landscape degradation. Responding to these 
challenges will require a diverse, globally distributed and interdisciplinary 
community of dryland experts united towards better understanding these vast and 
important ecosystems.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders 
affecting millions worldwide. The median life expectancy of someone with SCD 
remains significantly low despite improvements in standards of care and the 
implementation of hydroxyurea therapy. Notably, a 20-year interval existed 
(after the implementation of hydroxyurea therapy) prior to the approval of other 
sickle cell medications, namely, l-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab. In 
this systematic review, these new medications' impact on the occurrences of 
vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events were analyzed and the adverse events of each 
were noted. Further, a secondary analysis was conducted to determine the effect 
of combination therapies, whether synergistic, antagonistic, or additive. The 
systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The 
effect-based and dose-effect-based approaches were utilized to determine the 
combined drugs combination index based on the recommended dosage to achieve an 
efficacy of 50%. L-glutamine and crizanlizumab were effective in reducing the 
frequency of VOC (p= 0.0216 and p = 0.02). Voxelotor effect on the reduction of 
VOC occurrences was not significant, however, its effect on increasing 
hemoglobin levels was significant (p= <0.001). In all three therapies, pain was 
the most common adverse event reported by participants. The analysis of 
combination therapies revealed that voxelotor plus l-glutamine was synergistic, 
voxelotor plus crizanlizumab was antagonistic, and l-glutamine plus 
crizanlizumab was additive. Thus, voxelotor plus l-glutamine combination therapy 
may be more beneficial to sickle cell disease patients. As such, robust 
combination drug studies for approved therapies used in SCD should be initiated 
with a specific focus on voxelotor plus l-glutamine. Additionally, the 
development of medications that lessen the pain burden in sickle cell disease 
patients should also be prioritized.

BACKGROUND: Today, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of 
mortality in both sexes. There are several risk factors for heart diseases; some 
controllable, others not. However, socioeconomic, technological, and 
environmental factors can impact CVD as well as exclusive risk factors. Accurate 
identification and assessment of these factors are often difficult. In the 
present systematic review, we aimed to explore factors affecting CVD.
METHODS: Multiple databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane) 
and gray literature were searched. The included studies described at least one 
determinant of CVD. The framework method was applied to analyze the qualitative 
data.
RESULTS: A total of 64 studies from 26 countries were included. The contextual 
determinants of CVD were categorized into 45 determinants, 15 factors, and 4 
main social, economic, technological, and environmental categories. The 15 
potentially reversible factors were identified as sociodemographic, violence, 
smoking, occupation, positive childhood experience, social inequalities, 
psychological distress, eating habits, neighborhood, family income, rapid 
technology, environmental pollution, living environments, noise, and disaster.
CONCLUSIONS: Devolution and more efficient health policies are required to 
achieve further sustained reduction in CVD mortality, increase life expectancy, 
and reduce its associated risk factors. Policymakers should fully address the 
value of social, economic, technological, and environmental factors. In fact, a 
prevention agenda should be developed and updated collaboratively in terms of 
the determinant factors.

The upregulation telomerase activity is observed in over 85-90% of human cancers 
and provides an attractive target for cancer therapies. The high guanine content 
in the telomere DNA sequences and the hTERT promoter can form G-quadruplexes 
(G4s). Small molecules targeting G4s in telomeres and hTERT promoter could 
stabilize the G4s and inhibit hTERT expression and telomere extension. Several 
G4 ligands have shown inhibitory effects in cancer cells and xenograft mouse 
models, indicating these ligands have a potential for cancer therapies. The 
current review article describes the concept of the telomere, telomerase, and 
G4s. Moreover, the regulation of telomerase and G4s in telomeres and hTERT 
promoter is discussed as well. The summary of the small molecules targeting G4s 
in telomeric DNA sequences and the hTERT promoter will also be shown.
