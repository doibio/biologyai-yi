cost ($) and clinical outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years gained. 
Model parameters were informed by literature review and Medicare costs. 
Incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated in US dollars/quality-adjusted 
life-years gained, with a willingness-to-pay threshold set at 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. One-way, 2-way, and threshold sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Positron emission tomography using radiolabeled 18F-fluorocholine 
gained the most quality-adjusted life-years (23.9) and was the costliest 
($2,096), with a total treatment cost of $11,245 or $470/quality-adjusted 
life-year gained. Sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography and 
ultrasound were dominated strategies. Compared with 4-dimentional computed 
tomography, the incremental cost-utility ratio for positron emission tomography 
using radiolabeled 18F-fluorocholine was $91,066/quality-adjusted life-year 
gained in our base case analysis, which was below the willingness-to-pay 
threshold. In 1-way sensitivity analysis, the incremental cost-utility ratio was 
sensitive to test accuracy, positron emission tomography using radiolabeled 
18F-fluorocholine price, postoperative complication probabilities, proportion of 
bilateral neck exploration patients needing overnight hospitalization, and life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Our model elucidates scenarios in which positron emission tomography 
using radiolabeled 18F-fluorocholine can potentially be a cost-effective imaging 
option for primary hyperparathyroidism in the United States. Further 
investigation is needed to determine the maximal cost-effectiveness for positron 
emission tomography using radiolabeled 18F-fluorocholine in selected 
populations.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the annual burden of mortality and the associated health 
costs attributable to air pollution from wood heaters in Armidale.
DESIGN: Health impact assessment (excess annual mortality and financial costs) 
based upon atmospheric PM2.5 measurements.
SETTING: Armidale, a regional Australian city (population, 24 504) with high 
levels of air pollution in winter caused by domestic wood heaters, 1 May 2018 - 
30 April 2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated population exposure to PM2.5 from wood heaters; 
estimated numbers of premature deaths and years of life lost.
RESULTS: Fourteen premature deaths (95% CI, 12-17 deaths) per year, 
corresponding to 210 (95% CI, 172-249) years of life lost, are attributable to 
long term exposure to wood heater PM2.5 pollution in Armidale. The estimated 
financial cost is $32.8 million (95% CI, $27.0-38.5 million), or $10 930 (95% 
CI, $9004-12 822) per wood heater per year.
CONCLUSIONS: The substantial mortality and financial cost attributable to wood 
heating in Armidale indicates that effective policies are needed to reduce wood 
heater pollution, including public education about the effects of wood smoke on 
health, subsidies that encourage residents to switch to less polluting home 
heating (perhaps as part of an economic recovery package), assistance for those 
affected by wood smoke from other people, and regulations that reduce wood 
heater use (eg, by not permitting new wood heaters and requiring existing units 
to be removed when houses are sold).

Social decision making in severe alcohol use disorder: Scoping review and 
experimental perspectives.

Science Research Institute, UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe alcohol use disorder (SAUD) demonstrate 
multifaceted impairments in social cognition abilities, including emotional 
decoding or Theory of Mind. Such impairments are associated with real-life 
interpersonal difficulties, which in turn could contribute to the persistence of 
SAUD. However, little is known regarding how patients with SAUD make decisions 
in a social context and this literature has not been comprehensively reviewed.
OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this paper was to conduct the first review 
specifically focusing on social decision-making abilities in SAUD. Following 
PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews, we describe existing knowledge regarding 
the difficulties experienced by patients with SAUD during social interactions. 
Our second objective was to propose perspectives for future research, based on 
the shortcomings identified in the available literature.
DESIGN: We searched three online databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus) and 
identified 14 papers using behavioral tasks to assess social decision making in 
patients with SAUD.
RESULTS: Included studies assessed social decision making through three 
paradigms: (1) economic games (four papers), (2) moral dilemmas (four papers), 
and (3) interpersonal problem-solving (six papers). Results indicated that 
patients with SAUD behave differently from controls in all three paradigms.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies suggested large-scale social decision-making 
impairments or biases in SAUD. However, in light of the limited number of 
studies available and of the restricted set of processes measured, we call for 
the extension of this field through more ecologically relevant and model-based 
paradigms in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these effects.

[Gender Diversity and Impact on Work and Life Expectancy in Health Care. Results 
of a Survey Conducted in the Tuscany Region].

[Article in Italian]

Albanese S, Liberatore C, Morano S, Rosignoli P, Anastasio G, Civitelli F.

The percentage of female doctors employed in the health sector is constantly 
increasing both in Europe and in Italy with repercussions on organizational and 
socio-family models, currently not conceived in terms of equal opportunities, 
career and quality of life. The published studies have mainly taken into 
consideration economic and career disparities, (1) however, to date no study 
combined with surveys has highlighted criteria for evaluating the quality of 
work through the direct and sincere experience of workers. This reflection gave 
rise to the idea of a survey organized by the ANAAO Medical Women Group with the 
patronage of the Tuscan Medical Orders Federation organized on a homogeneous 
sample, i.e. female doctors from a single Region, Tuscany, in order to evaluate 
and new approaches in the management of human resources that take into account 
the delicate balance between the real possibilities available to the doctor and 
the complexities of experiential work that arise over the course of a lifetime. 
Empirical evidence deriving from specific investigations conducted at trade 
union and ordinistic level still document the existence of a gender gap between 
male and female doctors with respect to the reference parameters of quality 
work, such as the economic and ergonomic dimension, in relation to the physical 
and psychological aspects of people.

OBJECTIVES: Benefit and cost effectiveness of breast cancer screening are still 
matters of controversy. Risk-adapted strategies are proposed to improve its 
benefit-harm and cost-benefit relations. Our objective was to perform a 
systematic review on economic breast cancer models evaluating primary and 
secondary prevention strategies in the European health care setting, with 
specific focus on model results, model characteristics, and risk-adapted 
strategies.
METHODS: Literature databases were systematically searched for economic breast 
cancer models evaluating the cost effectiveness of breast cancer screening and 
prevention strategies in the European health care context. Characteristics, 
methodological details and results of the identified studies are reported in 
evidence tables. Economic model outputs are standardized to achieve comparable 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Thirty-two economic evaluations of breast cancer screening and seven 
evaluations of primary breast cancer prevention were included. Five screening 
studies and none of the prevention studies considered risk-adapted strategies. 
Studies differed in methodologic features. Only about half of the screening 
studies modeled overdiagnosis-related harms, most often indirectly and without 
reporting their magnitude. All models predict gains in life expectancy and/or 
quality-adjusted life expectancy at acceptable costs. However, risk-adapted 
screening was shown to be more effective and efficient than conventional 
screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic models suggest that breast cancer screening and prevention 
are cost effective in the European setting. All screening models predict gains 
in life expectancy, which has not yet been confirmed by trials. European models 
evaluating risk-adapted screening strategies are rare, but suggest that 
risk-adapted screening is more effective and efficient than conventional 
screening.

Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a re-emerging virus that can cause life-threatening 
yellow fever disease in humans. Despite the availability of an effective 
vaccine, little is known about the replication mechanism of YFV, and there are 
still no available specific anti-YFV medicines. Herein, by introducing the 
Renilla luciferase gene (Rluc) into an infectious clone of YFV vaccine strain 
17D, we generated a recombinant virus 17D-Rluc.2A via reverse genetics 
approaches. The 17D-Rluc.2A had similar plaque morphology and comparable in 
vitro growth characteristics with its parental strain. Importantly, the reporter 
luciferase was efficiently expressed in 17D-Rluc.2A-infected mammalian and 
mosquito cells, and there was a good linear correlation between intracellular 
luciferase expression and extracellular infectious virion reproduction. 
Furthermore, by a combination of the 17D-Rluc.2A reporter virus and selective 
2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) technology, the 
conserved 5'-SLA element was shown to be essential for YFV replication, 
highlighting the capability of 17D-Rluc.2A in the investigation of YFV 
replication. At last, we demonstrated that two compounds with distinct 
anti-viral mechanisms can effectively inhibit the viral propagation in 
17D-Rluc.2A-infected cells, demonstrating its potential application in the 
evaluation of anti-viral medicines. Taken together, the 17D-Rluc.2A serves as a 
useful tool for the study of YFV replication and anti-YFV medicine development.

INTRODUCTION: Excess mortality is a suitable indicator of health consequences of 
COVID-19 because death from any cause is clearly defined contrary to death from 
Covid-19. We compared the overall mortality in 2020 with the overall mortality 
in 2016 to 2019 in Germany, Sweden and Spain. Contrary to other studies, we also 
took the demographic development between 2016 and 2020 and increasing life 
expectancy into account.
METHODS: Using death and population figures from the EUROSTAT database, we 
estimated weekly and cumulative Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for the year 2020. We applied two approaches to 
calculate weekly numbers of death expected in 2020: first, we used mean weekly 
mortality rates from 2016 to 2019 as expected mortality rates for 2020, and, 
second, to consider increasing life expectancy, we calculated expected mortality 
rates for 2020 by extrapolation from mortality rates from 2016 to 2019.
RESULTS: In the first approach, the cumulative SMRs show that in Germany and 
Sweden there was no or little excess mortality in 2020 (SMR = 0.976 (95% CI: 
0.974-0.978), and 1.030 (1.023-1.036), respectively), while in Spain the excess 
mortality was 14.8% (1.148 (1.144-1.151)). In the second approach, the 
corresponding SMRs for Germany and Sweden increased to 1.009 (1.007-1.011) and 
1.083 (1.076-1.090), respectively, whereas results for Spain were virtually 
unchanged.
CONCLUSION: In 2020, there was barely any excess mortality in Germany for both 
approaches. In Sweden, excess mortality was 3% without, and 8% with 
consideration of increasing life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer is the second leading cause of death and a major public 
health problem in the world. This study reports the trend and burden of cancer 
from 1990 to 2017 along with its risk factors in Nepal.
METHODS: This study used the database of the Institute of Health Metrics and 
Evaluation's Global Burden of Diseases on cancer from Nepal to describe the most 
recent data available (2017) and trends by age, gender, and year from 1990 to 
2017. The data are described as incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY), and percentage change.
RESULTS: In 2017, the age-standardized cancer incidence and mortality rates were 
101.8/100,000 and 86.6/100,000 respectively in Nepal. Cancer contributed to 10% 
of total deaths and 5.6% of total DALYs in Nepal. The most common cancers were 
the breast, lung, cervical, stomach and oral cavity cancers. The number of new 
cancer cases and deaths in Nepal have increased from 1990 to 2017 by 92% and 95% 
respectively. On the other hand, age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 
decreased by 5% and 7% respectively. The leading risk factors of cancer were 
tobacco use, dietary factors, unsafe sex, air pollution, drug use, and physical 
inactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the burden of cancer in Nepal, contributing 
to a significant number of new cancer cases, deaths and DALY. A comprehensive 
approach including prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, and rehabilitation 
should be urgently taken to reduce the burden of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Secondary fracture prevention intervention such as fracture liaison 
services are effective for increasing osteoporosis treatment rates, but are not 
currently widely used in the United States. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness 
of secondary fracture prevention intervention after osteoporotic fracture for 
Medicare beneficiaries.
METHODS: An individual-level state-transition microsimulation model was 
developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention 
intervention compared with usual care for U.S. Medicare patients aged 65 and 
older who experience a new osteoporotic fracture. Patients who initiated 
pharmacotherapy and remained adherent were assumed to be treated for 5 years. 
Outcome measures included subsequent fractures, average lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
in 2020 U.S. dollars per QALY gained. The model time horizon was lifetime, and 
analysis perspective was payer.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis results showed that the secondary fracture 
prevention intervention strategy was both more effective and less expensive than 
usual care-thus, it was cost-saving. Model findings indicated that the 
intervention would reduce the number of expected fractures by approximately 5% 
over a 5-year period, preventing approximately 30,000 fractures for 1 million 
patients. Secondary fracture prevention intervention resulted in an average cost 
savings of $418 and an increase in QALYs of 0.0299 per patient over the 
lifetime; for 1 million patients who receive the intervention instead of usual 
care, expected cost savings for Medicare would be $418 million dollars. One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported base-case findings of cost 
savings.
CONCLUSION: Secondary fracture prevention intervention for Medicare 
beneficiaries after a new osteoporotic fracture is very likely to both improve 
health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs compared with usual care. Expansion 
of its use for this population is strongly recommended.

Smoking and Kidney Disease: Risk Factors, Challenges, and Preventive Strategies.

Clinical Background: Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) and smoking are both 
associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, the interplay between the 
two is not widely understood. Epidemiology: The incidence of CKD progression has 
been shown to be significantly higher among current and former smokers, and 
continued smoking thereafter has been associated with a nearly twofold higher 
risk of death. Challenges: Because it is a silent disease, CKD is often 
diagnosed in advanced stages, which underscores the importance of targeted, 
active screening for CKD. When CKD progresses to stage 5, life expectancy is 
drastically shortened unless life-saving renal replacement therapy (dialysis or 
kidney transplantation) is initiated. The treatment of smoking, which is a risk 
factor for CKD, also poses a challenge. Less than 10% of adults who want to quit 
smoking succeed in doing so, and those who do quit typically succeed only after 
making multiple attempts. In addition, many smokers have limited access to 
smoking cessation services, are unaware of available resources, or have 
misconceptions about smoking cessation therapies. Prevention and Treatment: 
There is evidence that quitting smoking may help prevent the development of CKD. 
However, glomerular filtration rates have been found to be higher in smokers 
than in nonsmokers, which could confound efforts to recognize smoking as a major 
risk factor for kidney disease. Efforts should continue to focus on the 
prevention of smoking, and nephrologists should promote smoking cessation as a 
means to prevent CKD progression.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in Australia is amongst the highest globally, but 
national estimates mask within-country inequalities. To monitor socioeconomic 
inequalities in health, many high-income countries routinely report life 
expectancy by education level. However in Australia, education-related gaps in 
life expectancy are not routinely reported because, until recently, the data 
required to produce these estimates have not been available. Using newly linked, 
whole-of-population data, we estimated education-related inequalities in adult 
life expectancy in Australia.
METHODS: Using data from 2016 Australian Census linked to 2016-17 Death 
Registrations, we estimated age-sex-education-specific mortality rates and used 
standard life table methodology to calculate life expectancy. For men and women 
separately, we estimated absolute (in years) and relative (ratios) differences 
in life expectancy at ages 25, 45, 65 and 85 years according to education level 
(measured in five categories, from university qualification [highest] to no 
formal qualifications [lowest]).
RESULTS: Data came from 14,565,910 Australian residents aged 25 years and older. 
At each age, those with lower levels of education had lower life expectancies. 
For men, the gap (highest vs. lowest level of education) was 9.1 (95 %CI: 8.8, 
9.4) years at age 25, 7.3 (7.1, 7.5) years at age 45, 4.9 (4.7, 5.1) years at 
age 65 and 1.9 (1.8, 2.1) years at age 85. For women, the gap was 5.5 (5.1, 5.9) 
years at age 25, 4.7 (4.4, 5.0) years at age 45, 3.3 (3.1, 3.5) years at 65 and 
1.6 (1.4, 1.8) years at age 85. Relative differences (comparing highest 
education level with each of the other levels) were larger for men than women 
and increased with age, but overall, revealed a 10-25 % reduction in life 
expectancy for those with the lowest compared to the highest education level.
CONCLUSIONS: Education-related inequalities in life expectancy from age 25 years 
in Australia are substantial, particularly for men. Those with the lowest 
education level have a life expectancy equivalent to the national average 15-20 
years ago. These vast gaps indicate large potential for further gains in life 
expectancy at the national level and continuing opportunities to improve health 
equity.

BACKGROUND: The accelerated aging trend brought great chronic diseases burdens. 
Disabled Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) is a novel way to measure the chronic 
diseases burden. This study aimed to explore the cohort, socioeconomic status 
(SES), and gender disparities of the DALYs trajectories.
METHODS: A total of 15,062 participants (55,740 observations) comes from China 
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2018. Mixed 
growth curve model was adopted to predict the DALYS trajectories in 45-90 years 
old people influenced by different birth cohorts and SES.
RESULTS: We find significant cohort, SES (resident place, education level and 
income) disparities differences in the chronic diseases DALYs. For individuals 
of earlier cohort, DALYs are developed in a late age but grow fast with age but 
reversed for most recent cohorts. Living in urban, having higher SES level will 
decrease the growth rate with age, but converges for most recent cohorts. 
Meanwhile, DALYs disparities of resident place and education level show gender 
differentials that those for female are narrowed across cohort but for male are 
not.
CONCLUSIONS: The cohort effects on chronic diseases DALYs are accumulated with 
China's unique social, and political settings. There are large inequalities in 
early experiences, SES and DALYs. Efforts of reducing these inequalities must 
focus on the lower SES individuals and those living in rural areas, which 
greatly benefit individuals from recent cohorts.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has experienced great improvements in life expectancy (LE) 
at birth over the last three decades. Despite consistent increases in LE for 
both males and females in Ethiopia, the country has simultaneously witnessed an 
increasing discrepancy in LE between males and females.
METHODS: This study used Pollard's actuarial method of decomposing LE to compare 
age- and cause- specific contributions to changes in sex differences in LE 
between 1995 and 2015 in Ethiopia.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth in Ethiopia increased for both males and 
females from 48.28 years and 50.12 years in 1995 to 65.59 years and 69.11 years 
in 2015, respectively. However, the sex differences in LE at birth also 
increased from 1.85 years in 1995 to 3.51 years in 2015. Decomposition analysis 
shows that the higher male mortality was consistently due to injuries and 
respiratory infections, which contributed to 1.57 out of 1.85 years in 1995 and 
1.62 out of 3.51 years in 2015 of the sex differences in LE. Increased male 
mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) also contributed to the 
increased difference in LE between males and females over the period, accounting 
for 0.21 out of 1.85 years and 1.05 out of 3.51 years in 1995 and 2015, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: While injuries and respiratory infections causing male mortality 
were the most consistent causes of the sex differences in LE in Ethiopia, 
morality from NCDs is the main cause of the recent increasing differences in LE 
between males and females. However, unlike the higher exposure of males to death 
from injuries due to road traffic injuries or interpersonal violence, to what 
extent sex differences are caused by the higher male mortality compared to 
female mortality from respiratory infection diseases is unclear. Similarly, 
despite Ethiopia's weak social security system, an explanation for the increased 
sex differences after the age of 40 years due to either longer female LE or 
reduced male LE should be further investigated.

BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease 
with systemic manifestations, which can cause significant mortality and 
morbidity. Population-based epidemiological studies on TSC mortality and 
survival remain scarce, though several recent studies provide evidence that TSC 
survival rates are high and disease prognosis is fair for most patients. This 
study aims to estimate the life expectancy and mortality statistics in Taiwanese 
TSC patients, investigate prognosis and associations of TSC mortality based on 
demographic variables, and compare these results to past literature, especially 
for Asian patients.
METHODS: Taiwanese National Health Insurance (NHI) insurees can obtain 
Catastrophic Illness Certificates (CIC) for certain eligible diseases to waive 
copayments after diagnosis by two independent physicians. CIC holders for TSC 
during 1997-2010 were identified from the NHI Research Database. Queries on 
enrollment (CIC acquisition) age, endpoint (end of query period or death) age, 
sex, and comorbidities were obtained. Patients were separated into cohorts 
(endpoint age, sex, and age of diagnosis), and analyzed accordingly.
RESULTS: 471 patients (232 male, 239 female) were identified, of which 14 died. 
Compared to literature, patients showed similar demographics (age range, 
diagnosis age, sex distribution); similar manifestations and prevalence 
(epilepsy, intellectual disability, renal disease); lower disease prevalence (1 
in 63,290); lower mortality (0.21% per year); and near-identical standardized 
mortality ratio (4.99). A cumulative mortality of 4.08% was found over 14 years, 
though mortality plateaued at 7 years post-enrollment, suggesting a good overall 
survival rate; comparable with previous studies in Asian patients. Enrollment 
age was a significant prognostic factor, with late-enrollment (age > 18) 
patients at higher risk for all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio = 6.54). Average 
remaining lifetime was significantly lower than the general population, and 
decreased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a population-based disease database, highlights 
the importance of diagnosis age in prognosis prediction, and suggests the role 
of renal manifestations in mortality. Furthermore, it corroborates recent TSC 
studies in the Asian population in terms of survival. Overall, physician 
vigilance, early diagnosis, and careful monitoring are beneficial for disease 
outcome and patient survival.

BACKGROUND: Men with African ancestry are more likely to develop aggressive 
prostate cancer (PCa) and to die from this disease. The study of PCa in the 
South African population represents an opportunity for biomedical research due 
to the high prevalence of aggressive PCa. While inflammation is known to play a 
significant role in PCa progression, its association with tumor stage in 
populations of African descent has not been explored in detail. Identification 
of new metabolic biomarkers of inflammation may improve diagnosis of patients 
with aggressive PCa.
METHODS: Plasma samples were profiled from 41 South African men with PCa using 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A total of 41 features, including 
metabolites, lipid classes, total protein, and the inflammatory NMR markers, 
GlycA, and GlycB, were quantified from each NMR spectrum. The Bruker's B.I.-LISA 
protocols were used to characterize 114 parameters related to the lipoproteins. 
The unsupervised KODAMA method was used to stratify the patients of our cohort 
based on their metabolic profile.
RESULTS: We found that the plasma of patients with very high risk, aggressive 
PCa and high level of C-reactive protein have a peculiar metabolic phenotype 
(metabotype) characterized by extremely high levels of GlycA and GlycB. The 
inflammatory processes linked to the higher level of GlycA and GlycB are 
characterized by a deep change of the plasma metabolome that may be used to 
improve the stratification of patients with PCa. We also identified a not 
previously known relationship between high values of VLDL and low level of GlycB 
in a different metabotype of patients characterized by lower-risk PCa.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a portrait of the metabolic changes in African 
men with PCa has been delineated indicating a strong association between 
inflammation and metabolic profiles. Our findings indicate how the metabolic 
profile could be used to identify those patients with high level of 
inflammation, characterized by aggressive PCa and short life expectancy. 
Integrating a metabolomic analysis as a tool for patient stratification could be 
important for opening the door to the development of new therapies. Further 
investigations are needed to understand the prevalence of an inflammatory 
metabotype in patients with aggressive PCa.

BACKGROUND: There is a need for effective and cost-effective interprofessional 
care models that support older people to maintain their quality of life (QoL) 
and physical performance to live longer independently in their own homes.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate effectiveness, QoL and physical 
performance, and cost-utility of a people-centred care model (PCCM), including 
the contribution of clinically trained pharmacists, compared with that of usual 
care in primary care.
METHODS: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a two-year follow-up was 
conducted. The participants were multimorbid community-living older people, aged 
≥75 years. The intervention comprised an at-home patient interview, health 
review, pharmacist-led clinical medication review, an interprofessional team 
meeting, and nurse-led care coordination and health support. At the baseline and 
at the 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, QoL (SF-36, 36-Item Short-Form Health 
Survey) and physical performance (SPPB, Short Performance Physical Battery) were 
measured. Additionally, a physical dimension component summary in the SF-36 was 
calculated. The SF-36 data were transformed into SF-6D scores to calculate 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Healthcare resource use were collected and 
transformed into costs. A healthcare payer perspective was adopted. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and one-way sensitivity analysis 
was performed.
RESULTS: No statistically or clinically significant differences were observed 
between the usual care (n = 126) and intervention group (n = 151) patients in 
their QoL; at the 2-year follow-up the mean difference was -0.02, (95 % CI 
-0.07; 0.04,p = 0.56). While the mean difference between the groups in physical 
performance at the 2-year follow-up was -1.02, (-1.94;-0.10,p = 0.03), between 
the physical component summary scores it was -7.3, (-15.2; 0.6,p = 0.07). The 
ICER was -73 638€/QALY, hence, the developed PCCM dominated usual care, since it 
was more effective and less costly.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-utility analysis showed that the PCCM including 
pharmacist-led medication review dominated usual care. However, it had no effect 
on QoL and the effect towards physical performance remained unclear.

INTRODUCTION: Hip fractures in centenarians are rising due to the increase in 
life expectancy. The objective of this study is to compare the characteristics 
of centenarians' hip fracture with a younger control group, and to analyze 
whether there are differences in terms of in-hospital mortality, complications, 
and short-medium-term survival between them.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective case-control study, with a series of 24 
centenarians and 48 octogenarians with a hip fracture. Comorbidities and 
Charlson index, surgical delay, complications and mortality during admission, 
and hospital stay were analyzed. At discharge, early mortality, survival after 
one year, and return to previous functionality were assessed.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in baseline parameters or 
comorbidities (P>.05), and the type of was a woman with an extracapsular 
fracture. Hospital stay was longer in the control group (P=.038), and the most 
frequent complication was anemia requiring transfusion (23/24 in centenarians, 
P<.0001). In-hospital mortality and accumulated at one year in the centenarians 
was 33 and 67%, respectively, compared to 10 and 25% in the octogenarians 
(P=.017, OR=4.3 [1,224-15,101] and P=.110). Only 2 centenarian patients were 
able to walk again after the intervention, while in the control group 53.84% 
returned to the previous functional situation (P=.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a control group of younger patients, in-hospital 
mortality and in the first year after a hip fracture is significantly higher in 
centenarians, and very few recover activity prior to the fracture.

BACKGROUND: For men on active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer (PCa), 
disease progression and age-related changes in health may influence decisions 
about pursuing curative treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predicted PCa and non-PCa mortality at the time of 
reclassification among men on AS, to identify clinical criteria for considering 
a transition from AS to watchful waiting (WW).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in a large AS program who 
experienced biopsy grade reclassification (Gleason grade increase) were 
retrospectively examined. All patients who had complete documentation of medical 
comorbidities at reclassification were included.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A validated model was used to 
assess 10- and 15-yr untreated PCa and non-PCa mortalities based on patient 
comorbidities and PCa clinical characteristics. We compared the ratio of 
predicted PCa mortality with predicted non-PCa mortality ("predicted mortality 
ratio") and divided patients into four risk tiers based on this ratio: (1) tier 
1 (ratio: >0.33), (2) tier 2 (ratio 0.33-0.20), (3) tier 3 (ratio 0.20-0.10), 
and (4) tier 4 (ratio <0.10).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 344 men who were reclassified, 98 (28%) were in 
risk tier 1, 85 (25%) in tier 2, 93 (27%) in tier 3, and 68 (20%) in tier 4 for 
10-yr mortality. Fifteen-year risk tiers were distributed similarly. The 23 
(6.7%) men who met the "transition triad" (age >75 yr, Charlson Comorbidity 
Index >3, and grade group ≤2) had a 14-fold higher non-PCa mortality risk and a 
lower predicted mortality ratio than those who did not (0.07 vs 0.23, p < 
0.001). The primary limitations of our study included its retrospective nature 
and the use of predicted mortalities.
CONCLUSIONS: At reclassification, nearly half of patients had a more than 
five-fold and one in five patients had a more than ten-fold higher risk of 
non-PCa death than patients having a risk of untreated PCa death. Despite a more 
significant cancer diagnosis, a transition to WW for older men with multiple 
comorbidities and grade group <3 PCa should be considered.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Men with favorable-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy of 
>10 yr are often enrolled in active surveillance, which entails delay of 
curative treatment until there is evidence of more aggressive disease. We 
examined a group of men on active surveillance who developed more aggressive 
disease, and found, nevertheless, that the majority of these men continued to 
have a dramatically higher risk of death from non-prostate cancer causes than 
from prostate cancer based on a risk prediction tool. For men older than 75 yr, 
who have multiple medical conditions and who do not have higher-grade cancer, it 
may be reasonable to reconsider the need for curative treatment given the low 
risk of death from prostate cancer compared with the risk of death from other 
causes.

Life expectancy has increased worldwide and, along with it, a greater prevalence 
of age-dependent disorders, chronic illnesses and comorbidities can be observed. 
In 2019, in both Europe and the Americas, dementias ranked 3rd among the top 10 
causes of death. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent type of 
neurodegenerative disease. In the last decades, globally, the number of people 
suffering from PD has more than doubled to over 6 million. Of all the 
neurological disorders, PD increased with the fastest rate. This troubling trend 
highlights the stringent need for accurate diagnostic biomarkers, especially in 
the early stages of the disease and to evaluate treatment response. To gain a 
broad and complex understanding of the recent advances in the '-omics' research 
fields, electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Academic, and Science Direct 
were searched for publications regarding metabolomic studies on PD to identify
