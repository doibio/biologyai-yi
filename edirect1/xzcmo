RESULTS: Here we propose a novel method for clustering a set of proteins based 
on their 3D structure focusing on 3D structures of BcR IG from a large series of 
patients with CLL. The method combines techniques from the areas of 
bioinformatics, 3D object recognition and machine learning. The clustering 
procedure is based on the extraction of 3D descriptors, encoding various 
properties of the local and global geometrical structure of the proteins. The 
descriptors are extracted from aligned pairs of proteins. A combination of 
individual 3D descriptors is also used as an additional method. The comparison 
of the automatically generated clusters to manual annotation by experts shows an 
increased accuracy when using the 3D descriptors compared to plain 
bioinformatics-based comparison. The accuracy is increased even more when using 
the combination of 3D descriptors.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results verify that the use of 3D descriptors 
commonly used for 3D object recognition can be effectively applied to 
distinguishing structural differences of proteins. The proposed approach can be 
applied to provide hints for the existence of structural groups in a large set 
of unannotated BcR IG protein files in both CLL and, by logical extension, other 
contexts where it is relevant to characterize BcR IG structural similarity. The 
method does not present any limitations in application and can be extended to 
other types of proteins.

Daily life involves interactions with the external environment. In rats these 
apparently spontaneous interactions, often associated with the search for food, 
alternate with periods of rest in both the dark and light periods of the 24-hour 
day. Kleitman, in whose laboratory rapid eye movement sleep was discovered, 
referred to the temporal pattern as "the basic rest-activity cycle." The active 
periods of the basic rest-activity cycle occur approximately every 1-2 hours in 
an irregular stochastic pattern that has been described (perhaps unhelpfully) as 
ultradian rhythmicity. Both the spontaneous interactions and those evoked by 
salient, potentially threatening environmental events are accompanied by 
increases in brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature of approximately 1°C. The 
heat produced in BAT contributes to associated increases in the temperature of 
the brain (approximately 0.8°C) and the body (approximately 0.6°C). These 
temperature changes require extension of the conventional "homeostasis" 
framework of temperature regulation. They may function to facilitate the 
cognitive processing that underlies the vital decision making necessary for safe 
and effective interaction with the external environment.

The wide range sensing of extracellular signals is a common feature of various 
sensory cells. Eukaryotic chemotactic cells driven by GPCRs and their cognate G 
proteins are one example. This system endows the cells directional motility 
towards their destination over long distances. There are several mechanisms to 
achieve the long dynamic range, including negative regulation of the receptors 
upon ligand interaction and spatial regulation of G proteins, as we found 
recently. However, these mechanisms are insufficient to explain the 105-fold 
range of chemotaxis seen in Dictyostelium. Here, we reveal that the 
receptor-mediated activation, recruitment, and capturing of G proteins mediate 
chemotactic signaling at the lower, middle and higher concentration ranges, 
respectively. These multiple mechanisms of G protein dynamics can successfully 
cover distinct ranges of ligand concentrations, resulting in seamless and broad 
chemotaxis. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging analysis showed that the 
activated Gα subunit forms an unconventional complex with the agonist-bound 
receptor. This complex formation of GPCR-Gα increased the membrane-binding time 
of individual Gα molecules and therefore resulted in the local accumulation of 
Gα. Our findings provide an additional chemotactic dynamic range mechanism in 
which multiple G protein dynamics positively contribute to the production of 
gradient information.

INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, an estimated 189 million adults smoke tobacco 
"occasionally" but not every day. Yet few studies have examined the health risks 
of non-daily smoking.
METHODS: Data from the 1991, 1992, and 1995 U.S. National Health Interview 
Surveys, a nationally representative sample of 70,913 U.S. adults (aged 18-95 
years) were pooled. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for death through 2011 were 
estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression using age as the underlying 
time metric and stratified by 5-year birth cohorts in 2017.
RESULTS: Non-daily smokers reported smoking a median of 15 days and 50 
cigarettes per month in contrast to daily smokers who smoked a median of 600 
cigarettes per month. Compared with never smokers, lifelong nondaily smokers who 
had never smoked daily had a 72% higher mortality risk (95% CI=1.36, 2.18): 
higher risks were observed for cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease 
mortalities. Higher mortality risks were observed among lifelong non-daily 
smokers who reported 11-30 (hazard ratio=1.34, 95% CI=0.81, 2.20); 31-60 (hazard 
ratio=2.02, 95% CI=1.17, 3.29); and >60 cigarettes per month (hazard ratio=1.74, 
95% CI=1.12, 2.72) than never smokers. Median life-expectancy was about 5 years 
shorter for lifelong non-daily smokers than never smokers. As expected, daily 
smokers had even higher mortality risks (hazard ratio=2.50, 95% CI=2.35, 2.66) 
and shorter survival (10 years less).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the mortality risks of non-daily smokers are lower than 
daily smokers, they are still substantial. Policies should be specifically 
directed at this growing group of smokers.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether environmental rearrangements of the long-term 
care nursing home can affect disruptive behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia (BPSD) in residents with dementia.
DESIGN: Prospective 6-month study.
SETTING: The study was conducted before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) 
environmental rearrangements [skylike ceiling tiles in part of the shared 
premises, progressive decrease of the illuminance at night together with 
soothing streaming music, reinforcement of the illuminance during the day, walls 
painted in light beige, oversized clocks in corridors, and night team clothes 
color (dark blue) different from that of the day team (sky blue)].
PARTICIPANTS: All of the patients (n = 19) of the protected unit were included 
in the study. They were aged 65 years or older and had an estimated life 
expectancy above 3 months.
MEASURES: Number and duration of disruptive BPSD were systematically collected 
and analyzed over 24 hours or during late hours (6:00-12:00 pm) during each 
3-month period.
RESULTS: There was no significant change in the patients' dependency, risk of 
fall, cognitive or depression indexes, or treatment between phase 1 and 2. 
Agitation/aggression and screaming were observed mainly outside the late hours 
as opposed to wandering episodes that were noticed essentially within the late 
hours. The number of patients showing wandering was significantly lower over 
24 hours during phase 2. The number of agitation/physical aggression, wandering, 
and screaming and the mean duration of wandering episodes were significantly 
(P = .039, .002, .025, and .026 respectively) decreased over 24 hours following 
environmental rearrangements. Similarly, a significant reduction in the number 
and mean duration of wandering was noticed during the late hours (P = .031 and 
.007, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that BPSD prevalence can be reduced 
following plain environmental rearrangements aimed at improving spatial and 
temporal orientation.

Introduction  The steady increase in average life expectancy has led to a rise 
in the number of referrals of elderly patients for major operations. It is not 
clear whether age itself is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality after 
skull base operations. We investigated a possible link among a cohort of 
patients older than 80 years of age who underwent those surgeries in our 
department. Methods  We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who 
underwent skull base surgery at the TASMC (Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center) 
between 2000 and 2016. Results  A total of 369 patients underwent open skull 
base surgeries in our institution, and 13 were patients older than 80 years. The 
median age of the octogenarians was 83.4 (range 80-89), and the male-to-female 
ratio was 7:6. Twelve patients had major systemic comorbidities. Four patients 
had major complications associated with surgery: three had early wound 
complications, and one each had early central nervous system complications, 
early and late systemic complications, and late orbital complications. This 
complication rate is comparable to that of our younger group of 356 patients. 
The overall survival rate was measured for 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years, and it 
was not significantly different between the octogenarians and that of the 
younger patients. Further comparison of the elderly group with 13 matched 
younger patients revealed no difference of morbidity and mortality between the 
two groups. Conclusions  Despite their systemic comorbidities, the morbidity and 
mortality rates associated with skull base surgery in octogenarians appear to be 
comparable to that of younger patients undergoing the same procedures.

Natural History, Multimodal Management, and Quality of Life Outcomes of 
Trigeminal Schwannomas.

Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Background  Trigeminal schwannomas are the second most common among intracranial 
schwannomas. These can arise from anywhere between the root and the distal 
extracranial branches of the trigeminal nerve. Clinical presentation depends on 
location and size, including but not limited to facial hypesthesia or pain, 
headaches, dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. Literature is strikingly scant 
discussing the natural history of these lesions, while the treatment goals are 
heavily dependent on tumor presentation. Management decisions must be 
individualized to each tumor and each patient, while attempting to maximize the 
quality of life. We present the natural history of these lesions as well as 
their management by surgical resection or radiation therapy, and report 
long-term quality of life outcomes. Methods  Between 2001 and 2015, 24 patients 
(66.7% female) with trigeminal schwannomas were diagnosed and managed at 
Vancouver General Hospital. We analyzed the clinical presentation, surgical 
results, resection rates, patient quality of life, and complications. To 
complete the evaluation, we prospectively collected 36-Item Short Form Health 
Survey (SF-36) quality of life assessments for comparison. Results  We 
identified 12 patients treated with a craniotomy and surgical resection, 4 were 
treated with radiation therapy, while 8 patients were followed by observation. 
Mean age of study cohort was 49.2 years (range, 23-79 years), and most patients 
presented with facial hypesthesia (54.2%) and headaches (37.5%), while 37.5% 
were incidental findings. There were no major differences in patient 
demographics between the three groups. Patients offered surgery had larger 
lesions (mean diameter, 3.4 ± 1.1 cm) when compared with those that were 
irradiated or observed, and were more likely to have extracranial extension. 
Overall patient quality of life improved following treatment (ΔSF-36 + 12.9) at 
3.9 years. Conclusions  The treatment goals of trigeminal schwannomas focus on 
improvement in neurologic symptoms, relief of mass effect, and preservation of 
cranial nerve function. We demonstrate that smaller lesions found incidentally 
with minimal symptoms can be followed safely with serial imaging, with 1 of 9 
(11.1%) progressing to require treatment over the course of 7.1 years. 
Management of trigeminal schwannomas should be individualized with an 
involvement of a multidisciplinary skull base team.

We analysed differences in healthy life expectancy at age 50 (HLE50) between 
migrants and non-migrants in Belgium, the Netherlands, and England and Wales, 
and their trends over time between 2001 and 2011 in the latter two countries. 
Population, mortality and health data were derived from registers, census or 
surveys. HLE50 was calculated for non-migrants, western and non-western migrants 
by sex. We applied decomposition techniques to determine whether differences in 
HLE50 between origin groups and changes in HLE50 over time were attributable to 
either differences in mortality or health. The results show that in all three 
countries and among both sexes, older migrants, in particular those from 
non-western origin, could expect to live fewer years in good health than older 
non-migrants, mainly because of differences in self-rated health. Differences in 
HLE50 between migrants and non-migrants diminished over time in the Netherlands, 
but they increased in England and Wales. Improvements in HLE50 over time were 
mainly attributable to mortality decline. Interventions aimed at reducing the 
health and mortality inequalities between older migrants and non-migrants should 
focus on prevention, and target especially non-western migrants.

The prolonged life expectancy accelerates the development of implantable 
bioelectronic devices. However, conventional batteries with limited lifetime, 
rigid architecture, and inferior energy density greatly restrict their 
applications in patient's body. Herein, a novel flexible symmetric Na-ion 
microbattery based on the heteronanomat electrode and the biocompatible 
electrolyte has been developed. The film electrodes with sphere-in-network 
architecture are synthesized by simultaneously electrospinning and 
electrospraying followed by carbonization. The combined technologies allow a 
uniform incorporation of active materials/C spheres into the carbon nanofiber 
matrix, which results in the heteronanomat electrodes with robust structure, 
fast electron/ion transport, and compact mass loading. The flexible 
microbatteries are fabricated based on the interdigitated microelectrodes and 
the biocompatible electrolytes, which provides a new implantable power source 
for bioelectronics. As a proof-of-concept study, the symmetric sodium-ion 
microbatteries are constructed from the heteronanomat bifunctional electrodes 
(based on Na2VTi(PO4)3) and the biocompatible electrolyte. The high 
reversibility, fast kinetics, and high energy density of the symmetric system in 
the biocompatible electrolytes reveal their superior performance in 
bioenvironments. Moreover, the high capacity retention (over 98%) and the high 
stability of microbattery implanted in a living SD rat for a month further 
demonstrate its high reliability for long-term in vivo diagnosis. Therefore, 
this work not only presents a new sphere-in-net heteronanomat structure for 
fabricating high-performance electrode but also gives significant contributions 
to develop high-energy-density and high safety biocompatible power sources of 
implantable bioelectronics.

OBJECTIVES: Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend 
that ferritin and transferrin saturation should be tested in chronic heart 
failure (HF) and state that iron treatment with ferric carboxymaltose should be 
considered in HF patients with iron deficiency to alleviate symptoms and improve 
exercise tolerance and quality of life. This study evaluates the cost 
effectiveness of the implementation of this recommendation in four Nordic 
countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden).
DESIGN: We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing ferric carboxymaltose 
treatment with placebo over a one-year time period in each country. Data on 
healthcare resource use and health outcomes were taken from the CONFIRM-HF study 
and combined with country-specific unit costs. Differences in per-patient costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated.
RESULTS: QALYs were higher (increase of 0.050 QALYs per patient) in the 
iron-treated group compared with placebo. Per-patient costs were lower in all 
countries (with reductions ranging from €36 to €484). Fewer hospitalizations 
were one key driver of these results. Another important driver was how well the 
new routines for iron treatment can be integrated into the current healthcare 
management of HF. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the results to be robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency therapy in HF with ferric carboxymaltose compared 
with placebo is estimated to both improve health-related quality of life and 
save healthcare costs in all Nordic countries. A well-organized healthcare 
management of HF patients can enable the implementation of ESC-recommended 
treatment of iron deficiency without need for additional resources.

The effects of vacuum packaging, chitosan (1.5%, w/v), and natamycin (10 mg/L, 
w/v) on phyllo pastry quality were studied by monitoring microbiological, 
chemical, and sensory changes. Five lots were prepared with or without vacuum 
packaging, chitosan, and natamycin: A, air packaged (control); V, vacuum 
packaged; VC, vacuum packaged with chitosan; VN, vacuum packaged with natamycin; 
and VCN, vacuum packaged with both chitosan and natamycin. Based on the sensory 
acceptability data, a shelf life of 6 (A), 12 (V), 14 (VN), 16 (VC), and 17 
(VCN) days was obtained at 4°C. VCN treatment resulted in a shelf life extension 
of 11 days compared with the shelf life of the control. Microbiological data 
revealed that the combination of chitosan and natamycin resulted in significant 
reductions of microbial species (mesophilic total viable counts, yeasts and 
molds, psychrotrophic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and 
enterococci) of 1 to 3 log CFU/g on the final day (day 18) of storage. Results 
suggest that the combination of chitosan and natamycin, which is an effective 
antifungal agent, can delay the spoilage of phyllo pastry while maintaining 
acceptable sensorial characteristics and the original freshness and appearance 
of the product.

In 2006, Valiant introduced a variation to his celebratedPAC (Probably 
Approximately Correct) model to biology, by which he wished to explain how, with 
two simple mechanisms-random variation and natural selection-complex life 
mechanisms evolved in such a short time. Subsequently, several works extended 
and specialized the evolvability framework to more specific processes. In this 
study, we extend the evolvability framework to accommodate horizontal gene 
transfer, the transfer of genetic material between unrelated organisms. While in 
a separate work, we focused on the theoretical aspects of this extension and its 
learnability power; here, the focus is on more practical and biological facets 
of this new model. Specifically, we focus on the evolutionary process of 
developing a trait and model it as theconjunctionfunction. We demonstrate the 
speedup in learning time for a variant of conjunction to which learning 
algorithms are known. We also confront the new model with the recombination 
model on real data ofEscherichia colistrains under the task of developing 
pathogenicity and obtain results adhering to current existing knowledge. Apart 
from the sheer extension to the understudied prokaryotic world, our work offers 
comparisons of three different models of evolution under the same conditions, 
which we believe is unique and of a separate interest.

Obesity-related disease complications reduce life quality and expectancy and 
increase health-care costs. Some studies have suggested that obesity not always 
entails metabolic abnormalities and increased risk of cardiometabolic 
complications. Because of the lack of universally accepted criteria to identify 
metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), its prevalence varies widely among studies. 
Moreover, the prognostic value of MHO is hotly debated, mainly because it likely 
shifts gradually towards metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). In this review, 
we outline the differential factors contributing to the metabolic heterogeneity 
of obesity by discussing the behavioral, genetic, phenotypical, and biological 
aspects associated with each of the two metabolic phenotypes (MHO and MUO) of 
obesity and their clinical implications. Particular emphasis will be laid on the 
role of adipose tissue biology and function, including genetic determinants of 
body fat distribution, depot-specific fat metabolism, adipose tissue plasticity 
and, particularly, adipogenesis. Finally, the emerging role of gut microbiota in 
obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction as well as the search for novel 
biomarkers for the obesity-related metabolic traits and associated diseases will 
be briefly presented. A better understanding of the main determinants of a 
healthy metabolic status in obesity would allow promotion of this favorable 
condition by targeting the relevant pathways.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. 
Despite recognizing the importance of risk factors in dictating CVD 
susceptibility and onset, patient treatment remains a challenging endeavor. 
Increasingly, the benefits of prevention and mitigation of risk factors earlier 
in life are being acknowledged. The developmental origins of health and disease 
posits that insults during specific periods of development can influence 
long-term health outcomes; this occurs because the developing organism is highly 
plastic, and hence vulnerable to environmental perturbations. By extension, 
targeted therapeutics instituted during critical periods of development may 
confer long-term protection, and thus reduce the risk of CVD in later life. This 
review provides a brief overview of models of developmental programming, and 
then discusses the impact of perinatal therapeutic interventions on long-term 
cardiovascular function in the offspring. The discussion focuses on bioactive 
food components, as well as pharmacological agents currently approved for use in 
pregnancy; in short, those agents most likely to be used in pregnancy and early 
childhood.

BACKGROUND: Chronic disease has become one of the leading causes of poverty in 
China, which posed heavy economic burden on individuals, households and society, 
and accounts for an estimated 80% of deaths and 70% of disability-adjusted 
life-years lost now in China. This study aims to assess the effect of chronic 
diseases on health payment-induced poverty in Shaanxi Province, China.
METHODS: The data was from the 5th National Health Survey of Shaanxi Province, 
which was part of China's National Health Service Survey (NHSS) conducted in 
2013. Totally, 20,700 households were selected for analysis. We used poverty 
headcount, poverty gap and mean positive poverty gap to assess the incidence, 
depth and intensity of poverty before and after health payment, respectively. 
Logistic regression models were further undertaken to evaluate the influence of 
percentage of chronic patients in households on the health payment-induced 
poverty with the control of other covariates.
RESULTS: In rural areas, the incidence of poverty increased 31.90% before and 
after health payment in the household group when the percentage of chronic 
patients in the households was 0, and the poverty gap rose from 932.77 CNY to 
1253.85 CNY (50.56% increased). In the group when the percentage of chronic 
patients in the households was 1-40% and 41-50%, the poverty gap increased 76.78 
and 89.29%, respectively. In the group when the percentage of chronic patients 
in the households was 51~ 100%, the increase of poverty headcount and poverty 
gap was 49.89 and 46.24%. In the logistic model, we found that the proportion of 
chronic patients in the households was closely related with the health 
payment-induced poverty. The percentage of chronic disease in the households 
increased by 1 %, the incidence of poverty increased by 1.01 times. On the other 
hand, the male household head and the household's head with higher educational 
lever were seen as protective factors for impoverishment.
CONCLUSIONS: With the percentage of chronic patients in the households growing, 
the health payment-induced poverty increases sharply. Furthermore, the 
households members with more chronic diseases in rural areas were more likely to 
suffer poverty than those in urban areas. Our analysis emphasizes the need to 
protect households from the impoverishment of chronic diseases, and our findings 
will provide suggestions for further healthcare reforms in China and guidance 
for vulnerable groups.

BACKGROUND: Like other scientific fields, such as cosmology, high-energy 
physics, or even the life sciences, medicine and healthcare face the challenge 
of an extremely quick transformation into data-driven sciences. This challenge 
entails the daunting task of extracting usable knowledge from these data using 
algorithmic methods. In the medical context this may for instance realized 
through the design of medical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis 
and patient management. The intensive care unit (ICU), and by extension the 
whole area of critical care, is becoming one of the most data-driven clinical 
environments.
RESULTS: The increasing availability of complex and heterogeneous data at the 
point of patient attention in critical care environments makes the development 
of fresh approaches to data analysis almost compulsory. Computational 
Intelligence (CI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods can provide such approaches 
and have already shown their usefulness in addressing problems in this context. 
The current study has a dual goal: it is first a review of the state-of-the-art 
on the use and application of such methods in the field of critical care. Such 
review is presented from the viewpoint of the different subfields of critical 
care, but also from the viewpoint of the different available ML and CI 
techniques. The second goal is presenting a collection of results that 
illustrate the breath of possibilities opened by ML and CI methods using a 
single problem, the investigation of septic shock at the ICU.
CONCLUSION: We have presented a structured state-of-the-art that illustrates the 
broad-ranging ways in which ML and CI methods can make a difference in problems 
affecting the manifold areas of critical care. The potential of ML and CI has 
been illustrated in detail through an example concerning the sepsis pathology. 
The new definitions of sepsis and the relevance of using the systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in its diagnosis have been considered. 
Conditional independence models have been used to address this problem, showing 
that SIRS depends on both organ dysfunction measured through the Sequential 
Organ Failure (SOFA) score and the ICU outcome, thus concluding that SIRS should 
still be considered in the study of the pathophysiology of Sepsis. Current 
assessment of the risk of dead at the ICU lacks specificity. ML and CI 
techniques are shown to improve the assessment using both indicators already in 
place and other clinical variables that are routinely measured. Kernel methods 
in particular are shown to provide the best performance balance while being 
amenable to representation through graphical models, which increases their 
interpretability and, with it, their likelihood to be accepted in medical 
practice.

INTRODUCTION: This paper provides the first detailed analysis of the NIH 
prevention research portfolio for primary and secondary prevention research in 
humans and related methods research.
METHODS: The Office of Disease Prevention developed a taxonomy of 128 topics and 
applied it to 11,082 projects representing 91.7% of all new projects and 84.1% 
of all dollars used for new projects awarded using grant and cooperative 
agreement activity codes that supported research in fiscal years 2012-2017. 
Projects were coded in 2016-2018 and analyzed in 2018.
RESULTS: Only 16.7% of projects and 22.6% of dollars were used for primary and 
secondary prevention research in humans or related methods research. Most of the 
leading risk factors for death and disability in the U.S. were selected as an 
outcome in <5% of the projects. Many more projects included an observational 
study, or an analysis of existing data, than a randomized intervention. These 
patterns were consistent over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate level of support for primary and secondary 
prevention research in humans from NIH will differ by field and stage of 
research. The estimates reported here may be overestimates, as credit was given 
for a project even if only a portion of that project addressed prevention 
research. Given that 74% of the variability in county-level life expectancy 
across the U.S. is explained by established risk factors, it seems appropriate 
to devote additional resources to developing and testing interventions to 
address those risk factors.

University, Nagoya, Japan.

BACKGROUND: The management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms (UCA) in elderly 
population is a challenge. With a very high life expectancy and high risk of 
rupture in Japan, the need for identifying the best treatment modality is 
essential to help the patients in decision-making.
METHODS: This was a 2-year single-center retrospective comparative analysis of 
the outcomes of surgical clipping (SC) in patients aged above 75 and <75 years. 
The modified Rankin score was used to stratify the patients and to analyze the 
functional outcome. Functional status at discharge was the primary end point.
RESULTS: There were 224 patients with 239 aneurysms. About 12.5% of the patients 
were more than 75 years with a mean age of 77.85. The mean age of patients <75 
years was 60.96, and it was statistically significant. The overall 
male-to-female ratio was 1:3.3. The most common location was the middle cerebral 
artery followed by internal carotid artery at the posterior communicating and 
ophthalmic segments, and 22 patients had aneurysms of the posterior circulation. 
Nearly 77% of the aneurysms were <6 mm. There was no significant difference in 
size of the aneurysm as the age increased to more than 75 years. There were 
complications in 6 patients, and there was no mortality in the study population. 
There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome between the 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: SC can be considered a safe option for UCA in the aging population.

As populations increase their life expectancy, age-related neurodegenerative 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease have become more common. I2-Imidazoline 
receptors (I2-IR) are widely distributed in the central nervous system, and 
dysregulation of I2-IR in patients with neurodegenerative diseases has been 
reported, suggesting their implication in cognitive impairment. This evidence 
indicates that high-affinity selective I2-IR ligands potentially contribute to 
the delay of neurodegeneration. In vivo studies in the female senescence 
accelerated mouse-prone 8 mice have shown that treatment with I2-IR ligands, 
MCR5 and MCR9, produce beneficial effects in behavior and cognition. Changes in 
molecular pathways implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, synaptic 
plasticity, and apoptotic cell death were also studied. Furthermore, treatments 
with these I2-IR ligands diminished the amyloid precursor protein processing 
pathway and increased Aβ degrading enzymes in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. 
These results collectively demonstrate the neuroprotective role of these new 
I2-IR ligands in a mouse model of brain aging through specific pathways and 
suggest their potential as therapeutic agents in brain disorders and age-related 
neurodegenerative diseases.

We discuss premature deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in developing 
countries and the importance of a comprehensive approach, involving clinical 
judgement, prevention, appropriate use of technology to diagnose and guide CHD 
treatment. Healthcare policies and levels of knowledge vary tremendously 
resulting heterogeneous utilization of diagnostic strategies and treatments 
worldwide. Many countries with high mortality have low utilization of 
non-invasive cardiac imaging. Appropriate use coupled with guideline-based 
management could help to improve care in the developing world and potentially 
result in better life expectancy already experienced by most high-income 
countries. In a scenario of increasing costs, a rational utilization of 
resources is imperative for all nations. A stepwise approach to suspected CHD is 
necessary, starting from good judgement, adding tests only as needed, preferably 
filtering patients who might benefit from advanced imaging. In stable patients, 
non-invasive tests should be used as filters to invasive procedure, preventing 
stable patients from undergoing revascularizations of questionable benefit. In 
this article, we review the relative role of exercise testing, myocardial 
perfusion imaging, and coronary computed tomography angiography to evaluate CHD 
and how these can be utilized as ways to help guide management that could impact 
premature mortality in developing nations.

Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is effective in treatment of opiate 
dependents. However, there is a gap between the coverage of standard MMT clinics 
and the need of opiate dependents. Establishment of extension clinics of 
methadone maintenance therapy (EMMT) will increase the coverage and improve MMT 
accessibility. We implemented a prospective cohort study to understand the 
effects of establishment of community-based EMMT clinics comparing with MMT 
clinics in Yunnan Province.A total of 462 opiate-dependent clients were 
interviewed from the community-based EMMT clinics and standard MMT clinics 
located in 5 counties of Mangshi, Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, and Lianghe in 
Yunnan Province. The information on the demographic characteristics, drug risk 
behaviors, quality of life (QOL), and urine testing results for morphine of the 
clients was collected and compared between the EMMT and MMT clinics. A survival 
analysis method was utilized to know the retention situation of the newly 
enrolled clients with Kaplan-Meier method during 9 months treatment.Among the 
EMMT clients, 96.9% were male; 31.4% were Han; 61.4% were married; 39.0% had 
primary school education; 95.5% lived with their family or relatives; 96.9% who 
arrived the clinic less than 15 min; 52.9% had used drugs for more than 10 
years; and 16.7% injected drug. After 9 months therapy, there was no difference 
in the changes of life quality such as physical and psychological features, 
social relationships, environmental function, and total QOL and well-being 
between those of EMMT and MMT clinics. The positive detection rate of 
urine-morphine testing among newly enrolled clients of EMMT clinics decreased as 
the period of treatment lengthened. The average time of retention for newly 
enrolled EMMT clients who are still receiving the treatment was 175 days. And 
the average time from initiations to drop-out of treatment for newly enrolled 
EMMT clients was 122 days. The 9-month retention rates of the clients were 52.1%
