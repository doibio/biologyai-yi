BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoporotic spine fractures represent a significant 
factor for decreasing quality of life in the elderly female population. 
Understanding the mechanisms involved in producing these fractures can improve 
their prevention and treatment. This study presents a biomechanical method to 
produce a vertebral fracture, conducted on a human spine segment, observing the 
displacements and strains in the intervertebral disc, endplate, and vertebral 
body.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed two tests, one corresponding to an extension 
loading, and the second to an axial loading.
RESULTS: The maximum displacement in the target vertebral body presented higher 
values in the case of the extension as compared to the axial strain where it 
mainly occurred after the fracture was produced. The strains occurred 
simultaneously on both discs. In the case of the axial strain, due to the 
occurrence of the fracture, the maximum value was recorded in the spine body, 
while in the case of the extensions, it occurred in the neural part of the upper 
disc. The advantage of this method was that the entire study was an experiment, 
using optical methods, increasing the precision of the material data input.
CONCLUSIONS: The research method allowed recording in real time of a larger 
amount of data from the different components of the spine segment. If there was 
an extension component of the compression force at the moment of the initial 
loading, part of this load was absorbed by the posterior column with higher 
mechanical resistance. After the maximum capacity of the absorption was reached, 
in both situations the behavior was similar.

Asthma is now recognized as a heterogeneous disease, encompassing different 
phenotypes driven by distinct pathophysiological mechanisms called endotypes. 
Common phenotypes of asthma, referred to as eosinophilic asthma, are 
characterized by the presence of eosinophilia. Eosinophils are usually 
considered invariant, terminally differentiated effector cells and have become a 
primary therapeutic target in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) and other 
eosinophil-associated diseases (EADs). Biological treatments that target 
eosinophils reveal an unexpectedly complex role of eosinophils in asthma, 
including in SEA, suggesting that "not all eosinophils are equal". In this 
review, we address our current understanding of the role of eosinophils in 
asthma with regard to asthma phenotypes and endotypes. We further address the 
possibility that different SEA phenotypes may involve differences in eosinophil 
biology. We discuss how these differences could arise through eosinophil 
"endotyping", viz. adaptations of eosinophil function imprinted during their 
development, or through tissue-induced plasticity, viz. local adaptations of 
eosinophil function through interaction with their lung tissue niches. In doing 
so, we also discuss opportunities, technical challenges, and open questions 
that, if addressed, might provide considerable benefits in guiding the choice of 
the most efficient precision therapies of SEA and, by extension, other EADs.

Adaptive Finite Element Model for Simulating Crack Growth in the Presence of 
Holes.

This study presents a developed finite element code written by Visual Fortran to 
computationally model fatigue crack growth (FCG) in arbitrary 2D structures with 
constant amplitude loading, using the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) 
concept. Accordingly, optimizing an FCG analysis, it is necessary to describe 
all the characteristics of the 2D model of the cracked component, including 
loads, support conditions, and material characteristics. The advancing front 
method has been used to generate the finite element mesh. The equivalent stress 
intensity factor was used as the onset criteria of crack propagation, since it 
is the main significant parameter that must be precisely predicted. As such, a 
criterion premised on direction (maximum circumferential stress theory) was 
implemented. After pre-processing, the analysis continues with incremental 
analysis of the crack growth, which is discretized into short straight segments. 
The adaptive mesh finite element method was used to perform the stress analysis 
for each increment. The displacement extrapolation technique was employed at 
each crack extension increment to compute the SIFs, which are then assessed by 
the maximum circumferential stress theory to determine the direction of the 
crack growth and predict the fatigue life as a function of crack length using a 
modified form of Paris' law. The application examples demonstrate the developed 
program's capability and performance.

This work presented salient features of the steel behavior of seven metallic 
bridges close to, or over, 100 years old, among the Spanish conventional rail 
network as well as the results of a fatigue life expectancy study. A preliminary 
study of the properties of the constituent materials obtained from the bridges 
samples was carried out followed by dynamic fatigue tests under service 
representative loads. Due to the steelmaking techniques in the late 19th and 
early 20th centuries, disperse fatigue behavior results were obtained. However, 
the wide safety margins with which these bridges were designed, as well as the 
mechanical properties of the steel (relatively good mechanical resistance but 
with low ductility), seem to guarantee a long fatigue life. This estimate 
decreases sharply with increasing loads.

Conventional thermal and chemical treatments used in food preservation have come 
under scrutiny by consumers who demand minimally processed foods free from 
chemical agents but microbiologically safe. As a result, antimicrobial peptides 
(AMPs) such as bacteriocins and nisin that are ribosomally synthesised by 
bacteria, more prominently by the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have appeared as a 
potent alternative due to their multiple biological activities. They represent a 
powerful strategy to prevent the development of spore-forming microorganisms in 
foods. Unlike thermal methods, they are natural without an adverse impact on 
food organoleptic and nutritional attributes. AMPs such as nisin and 
bacteriocins are generally effective in eliminating the vegetative forms of 
spore-forming bacteria compared to the more resilient spore forms. However, in 
combination with other non-thermal treatments, such as high pressure, 
supercritical carbon dioxide, electric pulses, a synergistic effect with AMPs 
such as nisin exists and has been proven to be effective in the inactivation of 
microbial spores through the disruption of the spore structure and prevention of 
spore outgrowth. The control of microbial spores in foods is essential in 
maintaining food safety and extension of shelf-life. Thus, exploration of the 
mechanisms of action of AMPs such as nisin is critical for their design and 
effective application in the food industry. This review harmonises information 
on the mechanisms of bacteria inactivation from published literature and the 
utilisation of AMPs in the control of microbial spores in food. It highlights 
future perspectives in research and application in food processing.

Porphyromonas gingivalis has been identified as one of the major periodontal 
pathogens. Activity-directed fractionation and purification processes were 
employed to identify bioactive compounds from bitter melon leaf. Ethanolic 
extract of bitter melon leaf was separated into five subfractions by open column 
chromatography. Subfraction-5-3 significantly inhibited P. gingivalis-induced 
interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 productions in human monocytic THP-1 cells and then 
was subjected to separation and purification by using different chromatographic 
methods. Consequently, 5β,19-epoxycucurbita-6,23(E),25(26)-triene-3β,19(R)-diol 
(charantadiol A) was identified and isolated from the subfraction-5-3. 
Charantadiol A effectively reduced P. gingivalis-induced IL-6 and IL-8 
productions and triggered receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 mRNA 
level of THP-1 cells. In a separate study, charantadiol A significantly 
suppressed P. gingivalis-stimulated IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA levels 
in gingival tissues of mice, confirming the inhibitory effect against P. 
gingivalis-induced periodontal inflammation. Thus, charantadiol A is a potential 
anti-inflammatory agent for modulating P. gingivalis-induced inflammation.

As the human life expectancy increases, age-linked diseases have become more and 
more frequent. The worldwide increment of dementia cases demands medical 
solutions, but the current available drugs do not meet all the expectations. 
Recently the attention of the scientific community was attracted by natural 
compounds, used in ancient medicine, known for their beneficial effects and high 
tolerability. This review is focused on Ginger (Zingiber officinale) and explore 
its properties against Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia, two of the 
most common and devastating forms of dementia. This work resumes the beneficial 
effects of Ginger compounds, tested in computational in vitro and in vivo models 
of Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia, along with some human tests. All 
these evidences suggest a potential role of the compounds of ginger not only in 
the treatment of the disease, but also in its prevention.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has long remained the gold standard 
therapy to restore coronary blood flow after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 
However, this procedure leads to the development of increased production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can exacerbate the damage caused by AMI, 
particularly during the reperfusion phase. Numerous attempts based on 
antioxidant treatments, aimed to reduce the oxidative injury of cardiac tissue, 
have failed in achieving an effective therapy for these patients. Among these 
studies, results derived from the use of vitamin C (Vit C) have been 
inconclusive so far, likely due to suboptimal study designs, misinterpretations, 
and the erroneous conclusions of clinical trials. Nevertheless, recent clinical 
trials have shown that the intravenous infusion of Vit C prior to PCI-reduced 
cardiac injury biomarkers, as well as inflammatory biomarkers and ROS 
production. In addition, improvements of functional parameters, such as left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and telediastolic left ventricular volume, 
showed a trend but had an inconclusive association with Vit C. Therefore, it 
seems reasonable that these beneficial effects could be further enhanced by the 
association with other antioxidant agents. Indeed, the complexity and the 
multifactorial nature of the mechanism of injury occurring in AMI demands 
multitarget agents to reach an enhancement of the expected cardioprotection, a 
paradigm needing to be demonstrated. The present review provides data supporting 
the view that an intravenous infusion containing combined safe antioxidants 
could be a suitable strategy to reduce cardiac injury, thus improving the 
clinical outcome, life quality, and life expectancy of patients subjected to PCI 
following AMI.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating brain disorders. 
Currently, there are no effective treatments to stop the disease progression and 
it is becoming a major public health concern. Several risk factors are involved 
in the progression of AD, modifying neuronal circuits and brain cognition, and 
eventually leading to neuronal death. Among them, obesity and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) have attracted increasing attention, since brain insulin 
resistance can contribute to neurodegeneration. Consequently, AD has been 
referred to "type 3 diabetes" and antidiabetic medications such as intranasal 
insulin, glitazones, metformin or liraglutide are being tested as possible 
alternatives. Metformin, a first line antihyperglycemic medication, is a 
5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator 
hypothesized to act as a geroprotective agent. However, studies on its 
association with age-related cognitive decline have shown controversial results 
with positive and negative findings. In spite of this, metformin shows positive 
benefits such as anti-inflammatory effects, accelerated neurogenesis, 
strengthened memory, and prolonged life expectancy. Moreover, it has been 
recently demonstrated that metformin enhances synaptophysin, sirtuin-1, AMPK, 
and brain-derived neuronal factor (BDNF) immunoreactivity, which are essential 
markers of plasticity. The present review discusses the numerous studies which 
have explored (1) the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, (2) association of type 
2 diabetes with AD, and (3) the potential therapeutic effects of metformin on AD 
and preclinical models.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most severe bone malignant tumor, responsible for 
altered osteoid deposition and with a high rate of metastasis. It is 
characterized by heterogeneity, chemoresistance and its interaction with bone 
microenvironment. The 5-year survival rate is about 67% for patients with 
localized OS, while it remains at 20% in case of metastases. The standard 
therapy for OS patients is represented by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical 
resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The most used chemotherapy regimen for 
children is the combination of high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and 
cisplatin. Considered that the necessary administration of high-dose 
chemotherapy is responsible for a lot of acute and chronic side effects, the 
identification of novel therapeutic strategies to ameliorate OS outcome and the 
patients' life expectancy is necessary. In this review we provide an overview on 
new possible innovative therapeutic strategies in OS.

Background and Objectives: The term acrometastases (AM) refers to secondary 
lesions sited distally to the elbow and knee, representing 0.1% of all bony 
metastases. By frequency, pulmonary cancer and gastrointestinal and 
genitourinary tract neoplasms are the most responsible for the reported AM. 
Improvements in oncologic patient care favor an increase in the incidence of 
such rare cases. We performed a systematic review of acrometastases to the hand 
to provide further insight into the management of these fragile patients. We 
also present a peculiar case of simultaneous acrometastasis to the ring finger 
and pathological vertebral fracture. Material and Methods: A literature search 
according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses) statement was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
Scopus databases in December 2020 on metastasis to the hand and wrist, from 1986 
to 2020. MeSH terms included acrometastasis, carpal metastasis, hand metastasis, 
finger metastasis, phalangeal metastasis, and wrist metastasis. Results: In 
total, 215 studies reporting the follow-up of 247 patients were analyzed, with a 
median age of 62 years (range 10-91 years). Overall, 162 out of 247 patients 
were males (65.6%) and 85 were females (34.4%). The median reported follow-up 
was 5 months (range 0.5-39). The median time from primary tumor diagnosis to 
acrometastasis was 24 months (range 0.7-156). Acrometastases were located at the 
finger/phalanx (68.4%), carpal (14.2%), metacarpal (14.2%), or other sites 
(3.2%). The primary tumors were pulmonary in 91 patients (36.8%). The average 
interval from primary tumor diagnosis to acrometastasis varied according to the 
primary tumor type from 2 months (in patients with mesenchymal tumors) to 64.0 
months (in patients with breast cancer). Conclusions: Acrometastases usually 
develop in the late stage of oncologic disease and are associated with short 
life expectancy. Their occurrence can no longer be considered rare; physicians 
should thus be updated on their surgical management and their impact on 
prognosis and survival.

Although multiple nutrients have shown protective effects with regard to 
preserving muscle function, the recommended amount of dietary protein and other 
nutrients profile on older adults for maintenance of high muscle mass is still 
debatable. The aims of this paper were to: (1) identify dietary differences 
between older women with low and high relative skeletal muscle mass, and (2) 
identify the minimal dietary protein intake associated with high relative 
skeletal muscle mass and test the threshold ability to determine an association 
with skeletal muscle phenotypes. Older women (n = 281; 70 ± 7 years, 65 ± 14 
kg), with both low and high relative skeletal muscle mass groups, completed a 
food questionnaire. Skeletal muscle mass, fat-free mass (FFM), biceps brachii 
thickness, vastus lateralis anatomical cross-sectional area (VLACSA), handgrip 
strength (HGS), maximum elbow flexion torque (MVCEF), maximum knee extension 
torque (MVCKE), muscle quality (HGS/Body mass), and fat mass were measured. 
Older women with low relative skeletal muscle mass had a lower daily intake of 
protein, iodine, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), Vit E, manganese, milk, 
fish, nuts and seeds (p < 0.05) compared to women with high relative skeletal 
muscle mass. The minimum required dietary protein intake for high relative 
skeletal muscle mass was 1.17 g/kg body mass/day (g/kg/d) (sensitivity: 0.68; 
specificity: 0.62). Women consuming ≥1.17 g/kg/d had a lower BMI (B = -3.9, p < 
0.001) and fat mass (B = -7.8, p < 0.001), and a higher muscle quality (B = 
0.06, p < 0.001). The data indicate that to maintain muscle mass and function, 
older women should consume ≥1.17 g/kg/d dietary protein, through a varied diet 
including milk, fish and nuts that also contain polyunsaturated fatty acid 
(PUFA) and micronutrients such as iodine, Vit E and manganese.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, cognitive performance decline in the 
elderly has become one of the major global challenges. We aimed to evaluate the 
association of dietary vitamin D (VD), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), 
25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25(OH)D2), and total 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D) 
concentration with cognitive performance in older Americans.
METHODS: The data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES), 2011-2014 was used. The cognitive performance was assessed by the 
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word Learning 
sub-test, Animal Fluency test, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). A 
binary logistic regression model was applied to evaluate the association between 
VD and cognitive performance, and restricted cubic spline model was adopted to 
evaluate the dose-response relationship.
RESULTS: While comparing to the lowest dietary VD intake group, the multivariate 
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the highest 
dietary VD intake group were 0.51 (0.36-0.72) for the Animal Fluency test score 
and 0.45 (0.31-0.66) for DSST score, respectively; and those of serum total 
25(OH)D and 25(OH)D3 concentration were 0.68 (0.47-0.97) and 0.62 (0.44-0.86) 
for DSST score. L-shaped relationships were identified for dietary VD intake, 
serum total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D3 concentration with cognition performance. The 
associations between dietary VD intake, serum total 25(OH)D and cognitive 
performance were non-significant when stratified by gender.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that dietary VD intake, serum total 25(OH)D and 
25(OH)D3 concentration were positively associated with cognitive performance. 
Further studies are needed to clarify the possible effects of dietary VD intake 
and serum 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3 on cognitive performance.

Cereal-based foods, including breakfast (BC) and infant cereals (IC), are among 
the first solid foods introduced to infants. BC and IC are sources of macro and 
micronutrients that have beneficial effects on health, but can also be sources 
of harmful chemical and microbiological contaminants and nutrients that may lead 
to adverse health effects at high consumption levels. This study was performed 
under the RiskBenefit4EU project with the aim of assessing the health impact 
associated with consumption of BC and IC by Portuguese children under 35 months. 
Adverse effects associated with the presence of aflatoxins, Bacillus cereus, 
sodium and free sugars were assessed against the benefits of fiber intake. We 
applied a risk-benefit assessment approach, and quantified the health impact of 
changes in consumption of BC and IC from current to various alternative 
consumption scenarios. Health impact was assessed in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years. Results showed that moving from the current 
consumption scenario to considered alternative scenarios results in a gain of 
healthy life years. Portuguese children can benefit from exchanging intake of IC 
to BC, if the BC consumed has an adequate nutritional profile in terms of fiber, 
sodium and free sugars, with levels of aflatoxins reduced as much as possible.

Calorie restriction (CR) extends lifespan and retards age-related chronic 
diseases in most species. There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota has 
a pivotal role in host health and age-related pathological conditions. Yet, it 
is still unclear how CR and the gut microbiota are related to healthy aging. 
Here, we report findings from a small longitudinal study of male C57BL/6 mice 
maintained on either ad libitum or mild (15%) CR diets from 21 months of age and 
tracked until natural death. We demonstrate that CR results in a significantly 
reduced rate of increase in the frailty index (FI), a well-established indicator 
of aging. We observed significant alterations in diversity, as well as 
compositional patterns of the mouse gut microbiota during the aging process. 
Interrogating the FI-related microbial features using machine learning 
techniques, we show that gut microbial signatures from 21-month-old mice can 
predict the healthy aging of 30-month-old mice with reasonable accuracy. This 
study deepens our understanding of the links between CR, gut microbiota, and 
frailty in the aging process of mice.

Peat moss is an organic substance corroded by sphagnum moss and has a pH of 
3.0-4.0. Elemental sulfur is sulfated and oxidized by the action of bacteria to 
become sulfuric acid. These biological factors can alter the soil environment. 
Blueberries require soil with a pH of 4.5-5.2 and high organic matter content. 
In this experiment, we investigated whether different treatment rates of peat 
moss, elemental sulfur, and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria affect changes in soil pH, 
physicochemical properties, and electrical conductivity. We detected strong 
changes in soil pH as a reaction to the supply of peat moss, elemental sulfur, 
and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. The pH of the soil when peat moss and elemental 
sulfur each were supplied was reduced. In addition, the pH decreased faster when 
elemental sulfur and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were supplied together than 
elemental sulfur alone, satisfying an acidic soil environment suitable for 
blueberry cultivation. In this experiment, it is shown that peat moss, elemental 
sulfur, and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria are suitable for lowering soil pH. It was 
demonstrated that when elemental sulfur and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were 
treated together, the pH decreased faster than when treated with peat moss. It 
could be economically beneficial to farmers to use elemental sulfur and 
sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, which are cheaper than peat moss, to reduce the pH of 
the soil.

Using latent class and quantum models to value equity in health care: a tale of

Auburn University, Auburn, AL.

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 
introduced to address health equity concerns in value assessment. However, QALY 
fails to capture patient preference. Stated preference methods (eg, discrete 
choice experiment [DCE]) have been increasingly used to incorporate patient 
preference into the value assessment framework in health care. Still, ones with 
a moral dimension such as health equity do not exist. The objective of this 
paper was to describe 2 stated preference approaches that can empirically value 
health equity. First, the decision-maker perceptions of the prevalence of equity 
dimensions in DCE choice tasks are identified. A latent class model based on 
random utility theory is proposed to derive the value of equity from the 
decision makers with different perceptions of the prevalence of equity 
dimensions. Second, equity attributes are incorporated in DCE choice tasks, and 
a quantum choice model, which can capture stochasticity during the decision 
process in the mind of the decision makers, is used to value the equity. These 
approaches will improve existing value assessment methods to address health 
equity adequately. DISCLOSURES: This study received no outside funding.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death. 
Pharmacist-led medication review with follow-up might be cost-effective 
preventing cardiovascular diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To undertake a cost-utility analysis of the addition of 
pharmacist-led medication review with follow-up to usual care compared to usual 
care alone for cardiovascular outpatients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A state-transition microsimulation model was built to 
project outcomes over a lifetime time horizon. Inputs from a cluster randomized 
controlled trial conducted in primary health care centers in Chile with 
full-time pharmacists were used. Probabilities were estimated using 
patient-level data. Utilities and costs associated with each health state were 
obtained from the literature, whereas the intervention costs were retrieved from 
the trial. The public third-party payer perspective was used. Uncertainty was 
evaluated through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For the base case analysis, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$963 per quality-adjusted life-year was observed which was considered 
cost-effective. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses and were driven 
by decreased cardiovascular events resulting in lower mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Medication review with follow-up was deemed a cost-effective 
addition to usual care with low uncertainty.

BACKGROUND: In view of the expected increase in expenditure on hip replacement 
treatment in Belgium, the complication rate and potential waste reduction, as 
estimated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, we are 
not yet in a position to assess the efficiency of hip replacement treatment in 
Belgian hospitals. This objective study uses a cost-disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) ratio to propose a comparison of hip replacement surgery among 12 
Belgian hospitals.
METHODS: Our study seeks to innovate by proposing an interhospital comparison 
that simultaneously integrates the weighting of quality indicators and the costs 
of managing a patient. To this end, we associated a DALY impact with each 
patient safety indicator, readmission and mortality outcome. We then compared 
hospitals using both costs and DALYs adjusted to their case mix index. The 
adjusted values (costs and DALYs) were obtained by relating the observed value 
to the predicted value obtained from the linear regression model.
RESULTS: We registered a total of 246.5 DALYs for the 12 hospital institutions, 
the average cost (SD) of a stay being €8013 (€4304). Our model allowed us to 
identify hospitals with observed values higher than those predicted. Out of the 
12 hospitals evaluated, 4 need to reduce costs and DALYs impacts, 6 have to 
improve one of the two factors and 2 appear to have good results. The costs for 
the worst performing hospitals can rise to over €150 000.
CONCLUSION: Evaluating the rates of patient safety indicators, associated with 
cost, is a prerequisite for quality and cost improvement efforts on the part of 
managers and practitioners. However, it appears essential to evaluate the entire 
care chain using a comparable unit of measurement. The hospital's case mix index 
must also be considered in benchmarking to avoid drawing the wrong conclusions. 
In addition, other indicators, such as the patient's perception of the actual 
results, should be added to our study.

Although lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) can reduce lung cancer 
mortality by 20%, without an appropriate eligibility criteria, it may result in 
a waste of medical resources and a degree of unnecessary damage to participants' 
health. This study aims to give the optimal screening strategy in China based on 
cost-effectiveness analysis on pros and cons of different situations. From the 
perspective of primary healthcare system, a Markov model was built to simulate 
LDCT screening of 100,000 heavy smokers (>30 pack years) aged 40 in different 
situations. Model parameters mainly came from screening programs conducted in 
China and other countries, official public data, and published literature. Two 
indicators of primary outcome, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
net health benefits (NHB), were compared with those of no screening. Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to evaluate model uncertainties. We defined the optimal 
strategy as the one with both acceptable cost effectiveness and maximal NHB. 
Base-case analysis results showed that for all screening strategies, ICERs were 
less than three times of GDP per capita. As for NHB results, it showed that when 
the willingness to pay for screening was less than three times of GPD per 
capita, the largest NHB was obtained in the strategy which started screening at 
50 years old and this strategy showed stable performance in univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity as well. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: LDCT screening is cost 
effective in heavy smokers in China, and the optimal age to start screening is 
suggested to be 50 years old.

Recent improvements in the therapeutic armamentarium of oncology by the addition 
of targeted and immunotherapeutic agents have led to an increase in the life 
expectancy of advanced-stage cancer patients. This has led to an increased
