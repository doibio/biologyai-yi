to the National Death Index.
RESULTS: In our main analyses, we found that a 45-year-old woman with diabetes 
and a body mass index (BMI) of 45 kg/m gained an additional 6.7 years of life 
expectancy with bariatric surgery (38.4 years with surgery vs 31.7 years without 
surgery). Sensitivity analyses revealed that the gain in life expectancy 
decreased with increasing BMI, until a BMI of 62 kg/m is reached, at which point 
nonsurgical treatment was associated with greater life expectancy. Similar 
results were seen for both men and women in all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: For most severely obese patients with diabetes, bariatric surgery 
seems to improve life expectancy; however, surgery may reduce life expectancy 
for the super obese with BMIs over 62 kg/m.

[Cardiologic evaluation of patients undergoing chemotherapy].

[Article in Italian]

Bordoni B, Urbinati S, Tosoni A, Labanti G, Brandes A.

Life expectancy in patients affected by cancer has recently increased because of 
early diagnosis and actual therapies. In recent years, Oncology and Cardiology 
developed a tight relationship because of common risk factors (i.e., obesity, 
smoking, alcool intake, etc...), and for preventing the prothrombotic status due 
to cancer and the potential cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy. Cardiotoxicity 
incidence is reported from 1% up to 70% in retrospective analyses of drug 
protocols, mainly representing by left ventricular dysfunction (both reversible 
or irreversible), but also by arrhythmias, hypertension, atrioventricular block, 
coronary spasm, and arterial or venous thromboembolism. The early detection of 
the chemoterapy induced cardiotoxicity is now mandatory and can be obtained 
through a proper patients selection for different treatments and a strict 
monitoring during the follow-up period. The role of biomarkers of early cardiac 
damage, mainly, troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide-BNP, has been recently 
challenged, and algorithms are currently available. In the present paper, we 
propose how to perform a cardiological evaluation of patients undergoing 
chemotherapy tailored by the known adverse effects of the drugs.

Children born with the Amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 
(AMC) who lack elbow flexor muscles and have elbow extension contractures 
usually require assistance in performing ADL's that require reaching their hand 
to their face, head, and upper body. For tasks involving the UE, the elbow is 
the key to functional independence. Children born with Amyoplasia may benefit 
from selective surgeries to enhance functional independence and improve quality 
of life. Home therapy and splinting following these surgeries is an important 
part of gaining motion and improving function. This abstract will review the 
rehab and splinting following an elbow release to gain passive elbow flexion, 
and a long head of the triceps transfer for active elbow flexion in children 
with Amyoplasia.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy in patients with bipolar disorder has been reported 
to be decreased by 11 to 20 years. These calculations are based on data for 
individuals at the age of 15 years. However, this may be misleading for patients 
with bipolar disorder in general as most patients have a later onset of illness. 
The aim of the present study was to calculate the remaining life expectancy for 
patients of different ages with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
METHODS: Using nationwide registers of all inpatient and outpatient contacts to 
all psychiatric hospitals in Denmark from 1970 to 2012 we calculated remaining 
life expectancies for values of age 15, 25, 35 ⃛ 75 years among all individuals 
alive in year 2000.
RESULTS: For the typical male or female patient aged 25 to 45 years, the 
remaining life expectancy was decreased by 12.0-8.7 years and 10.6-8.3 years, 
respectively. The ratio between remaining life expectancy in bipolar disorder 
and that of the general population decreased with age, indicating that patients 
with bipolar disorder start losing life-years during early and mid-adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy in bipolar disorder is decreased substantially, but 
less so than previously reported. Patients start losing life-years during early 
and mid-adulthood.

Prehospital and Emergency Care: Updates from the Disease Control Priorities, 
Version 3.

BACKGROUND: It is increasingly understood that emergency care systems can be 
cost-effective in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The development of 
such systems, however, is still a work in progress. This article updates 
previous work in providing the most recent estimates of the burden of disease 
sensitive to emergency care, the current state of knowledge on the feasibility 
of emergency care, effect on outcomes, and cost-effectiveness in LMICs, and 
future directions for research, policy, and implementation.
METHODS: We calculated the potential impact of prehospital and emergency care 
systems using updated and revised data based on the global burden of disease 
study. We then assessed the state of current knowledge and potential future 
directions for research and policy by conducting a review of the literature on 
current systems in LMICs.
RESULTS: According to these newest updates, 24 million deaths related to 
emergency medical conditions occur in LMICs annually, accounting for an 
estimated 932 million years of life lost. Evidence shows that multiple emergency 
care models can function in different local settings, depending on resources and 
urbanicity. Emergency care can significantly improve mortality rates from 
emergent conditions and be highly cost-effective. Further research is needed on 
implementation of emergency care systems as they become a necessary reality in 
developing nations worldwide.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency care implementation in LMICs presents both challenges and 
opportunities. Investment in evidence-based emergency care, research on 
implementation, and system coordination in LMICs could lead to a more cost- and 
outcome-effective emergency care system than exists in advanced economies.

OBJECTIVE: Inappropriate prescribing and nonadherence have a significant impact 
on hospital admissions and patient quality of life. The English government has 
identified that community pharmacy could make a significant contribution to 
reducing nonadherence and improving the quality of prescribing, reducing both 
hospital admissions and medicines wastage. The objective of this study is to 
evaluate a community pharmacy service aimed at patients over the age of 65 years 
prescribed four or more medicines.
METHODS: Patients were invited to participate in the service by the community 
pharmacy team. The pharmacist held regular consultations with the patient and 
discussed risk of falls, pain management, adherence and general health. They 
also reviewed the patient's medication using STOPP/START criteria. Data were 
analysed for the first 6 months of participation in the service.
KEY FINDINGS: Six hundred twenty patients were recruited with 441 (71.1%) 
completing the 6-month study period. Pharmacists made 142 recommendations to 
prescribers in 110 patients largely centred on potentially inappropriate 
prescribing of NSAIDs, PPIs or duplication of therapy. At follow-up, there was a 
significant decrease in the total number of falls (mean -0.116 (-0.217--0.014)) 
experienced and a significant increase in medicine adherence (mean difference in 
Morisky Measure of Adherence Scale-8: 0.513 (0.337-0.689)) and quality of life. 
Cost per quality-adjusted life year estimates ranged from £11 885 to £32 466 
depending on the assumptions made.
CONCLUSION: By focussing on patients over the age of 65 years with four or more 
medicines, community pharmacists can improve medicine adherence and patient 
quality of life.

Technology drives both health care spending and health improvement. Yet policy 
makers rarely see measures of cost growth that account for both effects. To fill 
this gap, we present the quality-adjusted cost of care, which illustrates cost 
growth net of growth in the value of health improvements, measured as survival 
gains multiplied by the value of survival. We applied the quality-adjusted cost 
of care to two cases. For colorectal cancer, drug cost per patient increased by 
$34,493 between 1998 and 2005 as a result of new drug launches, but value from 
offsetting health improvements netted a modest $1,377 increase in 
quality-adjusted cost of care. For multiple myeloma, new therapies increased 
treatment cost by $72,937 between 2004 and 2009, but offsetting health benefits 
lowered overall quality-adjusted cost of care by $67,863. However, patients with 
multiple myeloma on established first-line therapies saw costs rise without 
corresponding benefits. All three examples document rapid cost growth, but they 
provide starkly different answers to the question of whether society got what it 
paid for.

OBJECTIVE: We show the variation of longevity indicators in China during the 
past 60 years and its correlation patterns with per capita GDP (GDPpc) both at 
provincial and inner-provincial level.
METHODS: Population data from six national population censuses in China 
(1953-2010) at provincial level and in several typical provinces in 2010 at 
county-level were selected. Four main longevity indicators were calculated. 
Pearson's r and distributed lags time series analysis between longevity 
indicators and GDPpc were conducted.
RESULTS: The results show that Guangxi and Hainan Provinces maintain relatively 
high long-lived population (population over the age of 90) across various 
population censuses. The distributions of the population over the age of 80 and 
life expectancy are significantly affected by both contemporaneous and 
historical GDPpc at provincial level. However, areas of high long-lived 
population (over the age of 90) exhibit continuously stable features that lack 
any significant correlation with GDPpc both at provincial and inner-provincial 
level.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a mixed distribution pattern of several 
longevity indexes and different relation to GDPpc. It shows consistent trend 
with Preston curve, that is, economic conditions may have limited influence on 
human longevity, especially for those who live longer than 90 years old. This 
study suggests that the economic development may favor the local residents to 
have access to live as old as 80 years old, but it is still difficult for most 
residents to reach the level of centenarians.

In the present study, the strain Brevibacterium frigoritolerans DC2 was explored 
for the efficient and extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles. These 
biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible 
spectrophotometry, which detected the formation of silver nanoparticles in the 
reaction mixture and showed a maximum absorbance at 420 nm. In addition, field 
emission transmission electron microscopy revealed the spherical shape of the 
nanoparticles. The dynamic light scattering results indicated the average 
particle size of the product was 97 nm with a 0.191 polydispersity index. 
Furthermore, the product was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, 
X-ray diffraction, and elemental mapping, which displayed the presence of 
elemental silver in the product. Moreover, on a medical platform, the product 
was checked against pathogenic microorganisms including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 
Salmonella enterica, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and 
Candida albicans. The nanoparticles demonstrated antimicrobial activity against 
all of these pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, the silver nanoparticles 
were evaluated for their combined effects with the commercial antibiotics 
lincomycin, oleandomycin, vancomycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, and rifampicin 
against these pathogenic microorganisms. These results indicated that the 
combination of antibiotics with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles enhanced the 
antimicrobial effects of antibiotics. Therefore, the current study is a 
demonstration of an efficient biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by B. 
frigoritolerans DC2 and its effect on the enhancement of the antimicrobial 
efficacy of well-known commercial antibiotics.

AIMS: To compare the burden of disease (BoD) attributable to diabetes expressed 
in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for five European countries in 2010.
METHODS: DALYs lost to diabetes as the sum of years of life lost and years lived 
with disability were estimated by sex and age using country-specific 
epidemiological data and global disability weights. Data from various secondary 
sources were combined to estimate health loss due to diabetes for France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. National statistical databases were used and 
if necessary, community studies were used to derive the prevalence of diabetes 
by sex and age group, which were weighted proportionately for a national 
population burden of disease estimate. All identified data were adapted to the 
Global Burden of Disease methodology (2010) to calculate the burden attributable 
to diabetes. No age weighting and discounting was applied. Sensitivity to 
different sources of variation was examined. Germany and Italy lost the largest 
number of DALYs due to diabetes, with 5.9 and 5.8 per 1,000 inhabitants, 
respectively, followed by Spain (4.4), France (3.7), and the UK (2.9). The 
highest burden was caused by mortality due to diabetes, with the exception of 
the UK, for which the burden due to disability of diabetes was higher. Mean 
DALYs lost were higher for women in Germany, Italy, and Spain and shown to 
increase with age for all countries. Sensitivity analysis in variation in 
disability weights and uncertainty in epidemiological data were shown to have 
effects on DALYs lost.
CONCLUSION: In spite of data limitations, the estimates reported here show that 
DALY loss due to diabetes imposes a substantial burden on countries. 
Cross-national variation in disease epidemiology was the largest source of 
variation in the burden of diabetes between countries.

The Southeastern Minnesota Beacon Project for Community-driven Health 
Information Technology: Origins, Achievements, and Legacy.

INTRODUCTION: The Southeastern (SE) Minnesota Beacon organized all the health 
care providers, county public health organizations, and school districts in the 
deployment and integration of health information exchange (HIE) and targeted 
health communication around childhood asthma and diabetes. The community 
cooperated to establish a clinical data repository for all residents in the 
11-county region. Through this community of practice approach that involved 
traditional and nontraditional providers, the SE Minnesota Beacon was able to 
realize unique applications of this technology. This manuscript overviews the 
associated organization and infrastructure of this community collaboration.
BACKGROUND: The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology (ONC), as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(ARRA) stimulus, established 17 projects throughout the United States targeting 
the introduction and meaningful use of health information technology (HIT). 
These 17 communities were intended to serve as an example of what could be 
accomplished. The SE Minnesota Beacon is one of these communities.
METHODS: The community ultimately opted for peer-to-peer HIE, using Nationwide 
Health Information Network (NwHIN) Connect software. The clinical data 
repository was established using the infrastructure developed by the Regenstrief 
Institute, which operated as a trusted third party. As an extension to HIE, the 
consortium of county public health departments created a patient data portal for 
use by school nurses and parents. Childhood asthma was addressed by creating, 
exchanging, and maintaining an "asthma action plan" for each affected child, 
shared throughout the community, including through the patient portal. Diabetes 
management introduced patient treatment decision tools and patient quality of 
life measures, facilitating care. Influenza vaccination was enhanced by 
large-scale community reporting in partnership with the state vaccination 
registry. The methodology and principles for arriving at these solutions 
included community engagement, sustainability, scalability, standards, and best 
practices that fit a variety of organizations-from large, robust providers to 
small organizations.
FINDINGS: The SE Minnesota Beacon demonstrated that all providers for a 
geographically defined population can cooperate in the development and shared 
governance of a low-cost, sustainable HIE, and the operation of a 
community-managed clinical data repository. Furthermore, these infrastructures 
can be leveraged to collaboratively improve the care of patients, as 
demonstrated for childhood asthma and adult diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSION: The shared governance of HIT by a community can palpably change the 
scope and success of collaborations targeted to improve patient and community 
health care.

The rapid growth of very elderly populations requires accurate population 
estimates up to the highest ages. However, it is recognised that estimates 
derived from census counts are often unreliable. Methods that make use of death 
data have not previously been evaluated for Australia and New Zealand. The aim 
was to evaluate a number of nearly-extinct cohort methods for producing very 
elderly population estimates by age and sex for Australia and New Zealand. The 
accuracy of official estimates was also assessed. Variants of three 
nearly-extinct cohort methods, the Survivor Ratio method, the Das Gupta method 
and a new method explicitly allowing for falling mortality over time, were 
evaluated by retrospective application over the period 1976-1996. Estimates by 
sex and single years of age were compared against numbers derived from the 
extinct cohort method. Errors were measured by the Weighted Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error. It is confirmed that for Australian females the Survivor Ratio 
method constrained to official estimates for ages 90+ performed well. However, 
for Australian males and both sexes in New Zealand, more accurate estimates were 
obtained by constraining the Survivor Ratio method to official estimates for 
ages 85+. Official estimates in Australia proved reasonably accurate for ages 
90+ but at 100+ they varied significantly in accuracy from year to year. 
Estimates produced by Statistics New Zealand in aggregate for ages 90+ proved 
very accurate. We recommend the use of the Survivor Ratio method constrained to 
official estimates for ages 85+ to create very elderly population estimates for 
Australia and New Zealand.

Gleason 6 Prostate Cancer: Translating Biology into Population Health.

PURPOSE: Gleason 6 (3+3) is the most commonly diagnosed prostate cancer among 
men with prostate specific antigen screening, the most histologically well 
differentiated and is associated with the most favorable prognosis. Despite its 
prevalence, considerable debate exists regarding the genetic features, clinical 
significance, natural history, metastatic potential and optimal management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Young Urologic Oncologists in the Society 
of Urologic Oncology cooperated in a comprehensive search of the peer reviewed 
English medical literature on Gleason 6 prostate cancer, specifically focusing 
on the history of the Gleason scoring system, histological features, clinical 
characteristics, practice patterns and outcomes.
RESULTS: The Gleason scoring system was devised in the early 1960s, widely 
adopted by 1987 and revised in 2005 with a more restrictive definition of 
Gleason 6 disease. There is near consensus that Gleason 6 meets pathological 
definitions of cancer, but controversy about whether it meets commonly accepted 
molecular and genetic criteria of cancer. Multiple clinical series suggest that 
the metastatic potential of contemporary Gleason 6 disease is negligible but not 
zero. Population based studies in the U.S. suggest that more than 90% of men 
newly diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo treatment and are exposed to the 
risk of morbidity for a cancer unlikely to cause symptoms or decrease life 
expectancy. Efforts have been proposed to minimize the number of men diagnosed 
with or treated for Gleason 6 prostate cancer. These include modifications to 
prostate specific antigen based screening strategies such as targeting high risk 
populations, decreasing the frequency of screening, recommending screening 
cessation, incorporating remaining life expectancy estimates, using shared 
decision making and novel biomarkers, and eliminating prostate specific antigen 
screening entirely. Large nonrandomized and randomized studies have shown that 
active surveillance is an effective management strategy for men with Gleason 6 
disease. Active surveillance dramatically reduces the number of men undergoing 
treatment without apparent compromise of cancer related outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The definition and clinical relevance of Gleason 6 prostate cancer 
have changed substantially since its introduction nearly 50 years ago. A high 
proportion of screen detected cancers are Gleason 6 and the metastatic potential 
is negligible. Dramatically reducing the diagnosis and treatment of Gleason 6 
disease is likely to have a favorable impact on the net benefit of prostate 
cancer screening.

BACKGROUND: Down syndrome is a genetic condition that contributes to a 
significantly shorter life expectancy compared with the general population. We 
investigated the most common comorbidities in a population of acute hospital 
patients with Down syndrome and further explored what the most common risk 
factors for mortality are within this population.
METHOD: From our database of one million patients admitted to National Health 
Service (NHS) Trusts in northern England, we identified 558 people who had Down 
syndrome. We compared this group with an age- and gender-matched control group 
of 5580 people.
RESULTS: The most prevalent comorbid diseases within the Down's population were 
hypothyroidism (22.9%) and epilepsy (20.3%). However, the conditions that had 
the highest relative risks (RRs) in the Down's population were septal defects 
and dementia. Respiratory failure, dementia and pneumonia were the most 
significantly related comorbidities to mortality in the Down syndrome 
population. In the control population, respiratory failure, dementia and renal 
failure were the most significant disease contributors. When these contributors 
were analysed using multivariate analysis, heart failure, respiratory failure, 
pneumonia and epilepsy were the identified risk factors for in-hospital 
mortality in the Down syndrome population. Respiratory failure was the sole risk 
factor for mortality in the Down syndrome population [RR = 9.791 (1.6-59.9) 
P ≤ 0.05], when compared with the risk factors for mortality in the control 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: There is significant medical morbidity in Down syndrome. This 
morbidity contributes to the lower life expectancy. Respiratory failure is a 
risk factor for mortality in Down syndrome. We need to thoroughly investigate 
people with Down syndrome to ensure any treatable illnesses are well managed.

Nalmefene for Reducing Alcohol Consumption in People with Alcohol Dependence: An 
Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.

As part of its single technology appraisal process, the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company (Lundbeck) marketing 
nalmefene (Selincro) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness 
for reducing alcohol consumption in people with alcohol dependence. The School 
of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of 
Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) 
and to produce a critical review of the company's submission to NICE. The 
clinical evidence was derived from three phase III, company-sponsored, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a diagnosis 
of alcohol dependence comparing nalmefene, taken on an as-needed basis, in 
conjunction with psychosocial support with placebo in conjunction with 
psychosocial support. Psychosocial support was provided in the form of BRENDA, 
an intervention of lower intensity than that recommended in NICE Clinical 
Guideline 115 (NICE CG115). Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted in people 
who were drinking at high or very high risk levels at baseline and maintained 
this level of drinking during the screening phase prior to randomisation. This 
subgroup forms the licensed population. There were a number of limitations and 
uncertainties in the clinical evidence base which warrant caution in its 
interpretation. In particular, the post-hoc subgroup analyses and high dropout 
rates in the three nalmefene studies meant that the inference of treatment 
effects might be confounded. The company's economic evaluation showed that use 
of nalmefene in conjunction with psychosocial support in the form of BRENDA 
dominated the use of BRENDA in conjunction with placebo, providing more 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a reduced cost. However, this evaluation 
did not meet the final scope issued by NICE, which specified that the comparator 
should be psychological intervention as defined in NICE CG115. The ERG produced 
alternative cost per QALY values for the comparison undertaken by the company 
and suggested three further comparisons deemed relevant: (1) nalmefene with 
psychological intervention as defined in NICE CG115; (2) delayed use of 
nalmefene in those who did not respond to psychological intervention as 
recommended in NICE CG115 alone; and (3) use of naltrexone outside of its 
marketing authorisation. The ERG thought it probable that using nalmefene in 
only those people who do not respond to psychological intervention alone was 
likely to be more cost effective compared with its immediate use in the entire 
licensed population. The Appraisal Committee accepted the comparison with 
psychosocial support in the form of BRENDA and believed that the most plausible 
cost per QALY was likely to be below £5100. Therefore, the Appraisal Committee 
concluded that nalmefene in conjunction with psychosocial support was a cost 
effective use of NHS resources compared with psychosocial support alone for 
treating people with alcohol dependence drinking at a high risk level, without 
physical withdrawal symptoms and not requiring immediate assisted withdrawal 
from alcohol.

PURPOSE: Previous research using numerical methods suggested that use of a 
cohort-based model instead of an individual-based model can result in 
significant heterogeneity bias. However, the direction of the bias is not known 
a priori. We characterized mathematically the conditions that lead to upward or 
downward bias.
METHOD: We used a standard three-state disease progression model to evaluate the 
cost effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention. We solved the model 
analytically and derived expressions for life expectancy, discounted 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted lifetime costs and incremental 
net monetary benefits (INMB). An outcome was calculated using the mean of the 
input under the cohort-based approach and the whole input distribution for all 
persons under the individual-based approach. We investigated the impact of 
heterogeneity on outcomes by varying one parameter at a time while keeping all 
others constant. We evaluated the curvature of outcome functions and used 
Jensen's inequality to determine the direction of the bias.
RESULTS: Both life expectancy and QALYs were underestimated by the cohort-based 
approach. If there was heterogeneity only in disease progression, total costs 
were overestimated, whereas QALYs gained, incremental costs and INMB were under- 
or overestimated, depending on the progression rate. INMB was underestimated 
when only efficacy was heterogeneous. Both approaches yielded the same outcome 
when the heterogeneity was only in cost or utilities.
CONCLUSION: A cohort-based approach that does not adjust for heterogeneity 
underestimates life expectancy and may underestimate or overestimate other 
outcomes. Characterizing the bias is useful for comparative assessment of models 
and informing decision making.

Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Term Every Three-Year Versus Annual Postoperative 
Surveillance for Low-Risk Papillary Thyroid Cancer.

BACKGROUND: Patients with low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) who 
demonstrate an excellent response to initial therapy have a 2% recurrence rate 
and 100% disease-specific survival within 10 years. Thus, annual surveillance 
may be excessive. We hypothesized that less frequent postoperative surveillance 
in these patients is cost effective.
METHODS: A Markov discrete time state transition model was created to compare 
postoperative surveillance tapered to 3-year intervals after 5 years of annual 
surveillance versus conventional annual surveillance in low-risk PTC patients 
with negative neck ultrasound and stimulated thyroglobulin less than 2 ng/mL 1 
year postoperatively. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were 
determined via literature review, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to assess areas of uncertainty.
RESULTS: The cost of annual surveillance was $5,239 per patient and yielded 
22.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 3-year strategy cost $2,601 less, 
but also yielded 0.01 less QALYs. Thus, the incremental cost per QALY of annual 
surveillance was $260,100. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
less frequent surveillance was more cost effective in 99.98% of 10,000 simulated 
patients. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that annual surveillance would 
be cost effective if the total cost of neck ultrasound could be reduced to $23 
or less.
CONCLUSION: Extending postoperative surveillance to 3-year intervals after 5 
years of annual surveillance in patients with low-risk PTC with excellent 
response to therapy is more cost effective than annual surveillance.

Although type 2 diabetes guidelines recommend less aggressive glycemic control 
for patients with limited life expectancy, many hospice patients continue their 
glucose-lowering medications, resulting in an increased risk of hypoglycemia. 
Three common reasons for overly tight glycemic control in hospice patients 
include (1) discussions about reducing or stopping chronic medications are 
uncomfortable; (2) many patients and families believe that mild hyperglycemia 
can cause symptoms; and (3) until 2014, Healthcare Information and Data 
Information Set (HEDIS) quality indicators for glycemic control included hospice 
patients. To address these issues, we recommend (1) providers discuss with 
patients and families upon hospice enrollment that diabetes medications can be 
reduced or discontinued as their life-limiting disease progresses; (2) keeping 
blood glucose levels between 200 and 300 mg/dL; and (3) educate providers that 
HEDIS measures now exclude hospice patients. Implementing these recommendations 
should decrease the risk of hypoglycemia in hospice patients and improve their 
quality of life.

Attainment of 70 years life expectancy by 2020 is one of the millennium 
development goals in Nigeria. This study examined the socio-economic 
determinants of life expectancy in Nigeria using data from 1980-2011. Judging 
from the endogeneity feature of the variables, A VAR and VECM frameworks were 
employed. Socio-economic features were proxy by secondary school enrolment, 
government expenditure on health, per capita income, unemployment rate and the 
Naira foreign exchange rate. It was found that, the conventional socio-economic 
variables such as per capita income, education and government expenditure on 
health considered to be highly effective in determining life expectancy of 
developing countries are not significant in the case of Nigeria. The study 
however suggests that, life expectancy in Nigeria could be improved if attention 
is given to quality of government health expenditure, unemployment and measures 
to halt the depreciation of the Nigerian Naira against major foreign currency.

INTRODUCTION: We tracked and analyzed the changes in the quality of life (QOL) 
of a stage 4 lung cancer patient receiving occupational therapy at home.
CASE DESCRIPTION: In a longitudinal study consisting of 4 evaluations over 9 
months, a 66-year-old female with lung cancer was assessed using the 
Philadelphia Geriatric Center (PGC) Morale Scale and the 100-Point Satisfaction 
Scale. The QOL scores over time and factors influencing changes in these scores 
were analyzed.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: A histogram of QOL scores demonstrated a rapid 
increase followed by a mild decrease and then stable level. Interviews revealed 
the patient's response to knowing her life expectancy, meeting a qualified 
occupational therapist, increasing her leisure activity, changing her family 
relationships and facing the prospect of death. We also confirmed that 
occupational therapy, such as writing letters or keeping a diary, reminded her 
of her late parents, hometown and childhood and helped her accept death.
CONCLUSIONS: For a terminal lung cancer patient, meeting an occupational 
therapist to discuss fear or self-loathing improved QOL. Further, an active 
lifestyle played an important role in helping the patient accept death and lead 
a peaceful and stable life.

We compared the cost-utility analysis for edoxaban at both doses with that of 
dabigatran at both doses, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (non vitamin K antagonist 
oral anticoagulants, NOAC) in a German population. Data of clinical outcome 
events were taken from edoxaban's ENGAGE-AF, dabigatran's RE-LY, rivaroxaban's 
ROCKET, and apixaban's ARISTOTLE trials. The base-case analyses of a 65-year-old 
person with a CHADS2 score >1 gained 0.17 and 0.21 quality-adjusted life years 
over warfarin for 30 mg od and 60 mg od edoxaban, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was 50.000 and 68.000 euro per quality-adjusted life 
years for the higher and lower dose of edoxaban (Monte Carlo simulation). These 
findings were also similar to those for apixaban and more cost-effective than 
the other NOAC regimens. The current market costs for direct oral anticoagulants 
are high in relation to the quality of life gained from a German public health 
care insurance perspective. The willingness-to-pay threshold was lowest for 
60 mg edoxaban compared to all direct oral anticoagulants and for 30 mg edoxaban 
compared to dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

There is increasing evidence that prenatal exposure to environmental factors may 
modify breast cancer risk later in life. This study aimed to investigate the 
effects of in utero exposure to low-dose alcohol on mammary development and 
tumor risk. Pregnant MMTV-erbB-2 mice were exposed to alcohol (6 g/kg/day) 
between day 13 and day 19 of gestation, and the female offspring were examined 
for tumor risk. Whole mount analysis indicated that in utero exposure to 
low-dose alcohol induced significant increases in ductal extension at 10 weeks 
of age. Molecular analysis showed that in utero alcohol exposure induced 
upregulation of ERα signaling and activation of Akt and Erk1/2 in pubertal 
mammary glands. However, enhanced signaling in the EGFR/erbB-2 pathway appeared 
to be more prominent in 10-week-old glands than did signaling in the other 
pathways. Interestingly, tumor development in mice with in utero exposure to 
low-dose alcohol was slightly delayed compared to control mice, but tumor 
multiplicity was increased. The results indicate that in utero exposure to 
low-dose alcohol induces the reprogramming of mammary development by mechanisms 
that include altered signaling in the estrogen receptor (ER) and erbB-2 
pathways. The intriguing tumor development pattern might be related to alcohol 
dose and exposure conditions, and warrants further investigation.

Aging with intellectual disability has become an important topic in light of the 
significant increase in life expectancy of this population. More specifically, 
the combination of gender, age, and intellectual disability raises unique social 
issues. The aim of this research was to capture and analyze the aging experience 
of women with intellectual disability from their own voice and viewpoint within 
the Israeli experience. A phenomenological qualitative method was used in this 
study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 women with mild-to-moderate 
intellectual disability. Four key themes arose from the interviews: (a) the 
importance of work and reluctance to retire, (b) ageism and the fear of getting 
old, (c) the importance of a significant partner in old age, and (d) today's 
positive self-perception. A meaningful aging process can be constructed within 
the context of gender and disability. It was manifested in this study as a 
disability-neutral experience. However, ageism and negative attitudes toward old 
age still need to be addressed.
