be elevated, including SCARB2, a host cell receptor protein involved in virus 
entry. A comparison with the plasma protein response in patients with severe 
symptoms shows a highly similar pattern, but with some interesting differences.
INTERPRETATION: The study presented here demonstrates the usefulness of "next 
generation plasma protein profiling" to identify molecular signatures of 
importance for disease progression and to allow monitoring of disease during 
recovery from the infection. The results will facilitate further studies to 
understand the molecular mechanism of the immune-related response of the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) frequently show 
peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). PC reduces life expectancy and quality of life. 
Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
(HIPEC) has been shown to improve overall survival. Nevertheless, it has been 
reported that CRS and HIPEC are accompanied by an increase in postoperative 
complications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the complications 
associated with CRS and HIPEC and overall and disease-free survival.
METHODS: Patients with AGC and PC, who received complete CRS and HIPEC, were 
included in the HIPEC group (n = 15). Patients with AGC but without PC, who 
received resection of the primary tumor alone, constituted the control group (n 
= 43).
RESULTS: Patients enrolled in the HIPEC group presented with a median PCI of 7. 
In comparison with the control group, no differences were found in patient 
characteristics, risk factors, pathological findings, and operative procedures. 
Twenty-five percentage of the patients in both groups suffered from serious 
postoperative complications (CDC ≥3a). Surgical and medical complications, rate 
of reoperation, and mortality did not differ. Also, the recurrence pattern, 
median survival, and 1- and 2-year survival rates showed no differences.
CONCLUSION: CRS and HIPEC do not lead to an increased postoperative morbidity 
and mortality in AGC with PC. Albeit the poorer prognosis of patients with PC, 
survival of both groups was comparable.

BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative condition that 
worsens over time. Given the lack of targeted treatments, patients with severe 
progressive supranuclear palsy have very low life expectancy.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 61-year-old Chinese man with severe 
progressive supranuclear palsy and treated with umbilical cord blood stem cells 
transplantation. After the umbilical cord blood stem cells therapy, his 
neurologic symptoms stopped deteriorating, his muscle rigidity was mildly 
improved, and he remains alive for more than 8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical cord blood stem cells transplantation may be an 
alternative therapy for patients with severe progressive supranuclear palsy.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of olaparib after being funded by 
the Spanish National Health Service (SNHS) as first-line monotherapy maintenance 
treatment in patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) 
and BRCA mutations in Spain.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model with one-month cycles was adapted to the Spanish 
healthcare setting, using the perspective of the SNHS, and a time horizon of 
50 years. Two scenarios were compared: receiving olaparib vs. no maintenance 
treatment. The model comprised four health states and included the clinical 
results of the SOLO1 study, along with the direct healthcare costs associated 
with the use of first-line and subsequent treatment resources (2020 €). A 
discount rate of 3% was applied for future cost and quality-of-life outcomes. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also carried out and a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of €25,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
was considered.
RESULTS: The introduction of olaparib as a first-line maintenance treatment for 
advanced HGSOC patients with BRCA mutations implied a cost of €131,614.98 
compared to €102,369.54 without olaparib (difference: €29,245.44), with an 
improvement of 2.00 QALYs (5.56 and 3.57, respectively). Therefore, olaparib is 
cost-effective for advanced HGSOC patients with BRCA mutations, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €14,653.2/QALY. The results from the PSA 
showed that 92.1% of the simulations fell below the €25,000/QALY threshold. The 
model showed that olaparib could improve the overall survival by 2 years, vs. no 
maintenance treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib as first-line maintenance treatment is cost-effective in 
advanced HGSOC patients with BRCA mutations in Spain.

Batten disease, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, refers to a 
diverse group of 13 hereditary inborn errors of metabolism resulting in the 
abnormal accumulation of autofluorescent storage material in lysosomes leading 
to neurodegeneration, typically with associated intractable epilepsy, behavioral 
dysregulation, cognitive, motor, language and visual decline, as well as a 
shortened life expectancy [1]. Assessment of disease progression within this 
population is fraught with difficulty because individuals may have limited 
attention or cooperation affecting compliance with requested tasks, or have 
visual impairment reducing options for methods of assessment. Further, language 
and cognitive assessments have been designed to assess typically developing 
individuals based on specific age limits, which then fail to capture low 
developmental functioning once the mental age of the individual drops below the 
basal age of the assessment tool. Yet, metrics to measure disease progression 
are essential to inform therapeutic decision-making, prognostication, and 
clinical trial outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The current study determined the level and trends associated with 
the incidence, death and disability rates for bladder cancer and its 
attributable risk factors in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2019, 
by age, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI; a composite measure of 
sociodemographic factors).
METHODS: Various data sources from different countries, including vital 
registration and cancer registries were used to generate estimates. Mortality 
data and incidence data transformed to mortality estimates using the mortality 
to incidence ratio (MIR) were used in a cause of death ensemble model to 
estimate mortality. Mortality estimates were divided by the MIR to produce 
incidence estimates. Prevalence was calculated using incidence and MIR-based 
survival estimates. Age-specific mortality and standardised life expectancy were 
used to estimate years of life lost (YLLs). Prevalence was multiplied by 
disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs), while 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are the sum of the YLLs and YLDs. All 
estimates were presented as counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 
population.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 524 000 bladder cancer incident cases (95% 
uncertainty interval 476 000 to 569 000) and 229 000 bladder cancer deaths (211 
000 to 243 000) in 2019. Age-standardised death rate decreased by 15.7% (8.6 to 
21.0), during the period 1990-2019. Bladder cancer accounted for 4.39 million 
(4.09 to 4.70) DALYs in 2019, and the age-standardised DALY rate decreased 
significantly by 18.6% (11.2 to 24.3) during the period 1990-2019. In 2019, 
Monaco had the highest age-standardised incidence rate (31.9 cases (23.3 to 
56.9) per 100 000), while Lebanon had the highest age-standardised death rate 
(10.4 (8.1 to 13.7)). Cabo Verde had the highest increase in age-standardised 
incidence (284.2% (214.1 to 362.8)) and death rates (190.3% (139.3 to 251.1)) 
between 1990 and 2019. In 2019, the global age-standardised incidence and death 
rates were higher among males than females, across all age groups and peaked in 
the 95+ age group. Globally, 36.8% (28.5 to 44.0) of bladder cancer DALYs were 
attributable to smoking, more so in males than females (43.7% (34.0 to 51.8) vs 
15.2% (10.9 to 19.4)). In addition, 9.1% (1.9 to 19.6) of the DALYs were 
attributable to elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (males 9.3% (1.6 to 20.9); 
females 8.4% (1.6 to 19.1)).
CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable variation in the burden of bladder cancer 
between countries during the period 1990-2019. Although there was a clear global 
decrease in the age-standardised death, and DALY rates, some countries 
experienced an increase in these rates. National policy makers should learn from 
these differences, and allocate resources for preventative measures, based on 
their country-specific estimates. In addition, smoking and elevated FPG play an 
important role in the burden of bladder cancer and need to be addressed with 
prevention programmes.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare connective tissue disease with a high 
risk of severe complications. Because of these complications, the median life 
expectancy for patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is estimated at 
48 years. However, the optimal management of these complications remains 
unclear. A 25-year-old man with abdominal pain was transported to our hospital 
by ambulance. He had undergone Hartmann's operation at 22 years of age for a 
first-time colonic perforation. At that time, a genetic test revealed germline 
variants in COL3A1, which encodes type III procollagen; therefore, the patient 
was diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. When the patient presented 
to our hospital, we suspected another colonic perforation and thus performed an 
emergency operation. Open abdominal management, transcatheter arterial 
embolization, and negative-pressure wound therapy were performed as life-saving 
measures. Notably, these procedures should initially be avoided in patients with 
vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome because of tissue fragility. Open abdominal 
management, transcatheter arterial embolization, and negative-pressure wound 
therapy may be useful for patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome who 
develop panperitonitis and massive intra-abdominal bleeding.

The changing Arctic environment is affecting zooplankton that support its 
abundant wildlife. We examined how these changes are influencing a key 
zooplankton species, Calanus finmarchicus, principally found in the North 
Atlantic but expatriated to the Arctic. Close to the ice-edge in the Fram 
Strait, we identified areas that, since the 1980s, are increasingly favourable 
to C. finmarchicus. Field-sampling revealed part of the population there to be 
capable of amassing enough reserves to overwinter. Early developmental stages 
were also present in early summer, suggesting successful local recruitment. This 
extension to suitable C. finmarchicus habitat is most likely facilitated by the 
long-term retreat of the ice-edge, allowing phytoplankton to bloom earlier and 
for longer and through higher temperatures increasing copepod developmental 
rates. The increased capacity for this species to complete its life-cycle and 
prosper in the Fram Strait can change community structure, with large 
consequences to regional food-webs.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a proven therapeutic tool to increase the 
quality of life and life expectancy in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). 
Despite this, the PA level of pwCF is lower than recommended.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to identify the barriers to and 
facilitators of PA in adults with CF with heterogeneous severity.
METHODS: Twenty adults with CF (mean age = 33.3±11.7 years, mean FEV1% = 
50.55±20.4%) were recruited from two specialized centers and interviewed about 
the factors that limit and facilitate their PA. The collected data were 
transcribed, coded and analyzed using deductive and inductive methods.
RESULTS: Barriers and facilitators were classified into physical, psychological 
and environmental dimensions. The main barriers were fatigue, breathing 
difficulties, lack of available facilities, negative perceptions of PA and 
perceived health risks. The most important facilitators were respiratory 
benefits, well-being, and social support.
CONCLUSION: Although some barriers and facilitators were similar to those found 
in children with CF or adults from other vulnerable populations, others were 
specific to adults with CF, such as the risk of cross-contamination and 
transplant preparation. The comprehensive study of the barriers and facilitators 
in adults will enhance PA counseling for pwCF and help improve their compliance 
with PA recommendations.

INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is an instrument which has been utilized for a variety of 
purposes, including in health-economic appraisals as an input into 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations. Indeed, it is the most-widely 
applied instrument for health-economic appraisal worldwide, and is recommended 
for use in QALY calculations by many national Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 
agencies. There is also a growing body of evidence for its usefulness in a 
variety of settings other than economic appraisals, but such use has not been 
well-documented. This study addresses this issue and documents how EQ-5D has 
been applied in both the non-economic and economic contexts.
METHODS: The PubMed database was searched using the terms 'EQ-5D', 'EQ-5D AND 
cost', and 'EQ-5D AND cost AND QALY' from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2019. We 
concentrated on 2019 publications for more detailed analyses. All the data 
collected for 2019 were downloaded and collected in EndNote. For 2019 only, we 
classified economic and non-economic use based on the inclusion of 'cost'. We 
also checked by manual inspection whether the search terms were suitable in 
correctly identifying economic and non-economic use. Variants of the 
non-economic use of EQ-5D were classified as follows: (a) as a quality of life 
outcome measure; (b) as a tool for methodological research; (c) methodological 
issues of EQ-5D itself; (d) comparisons with other quality of life 
questionnaires; (e) mapping studies; (f) value sets; (g) alongside costs but no 
QALY calculated; and (h) other.
RESULTS: The first publication found was from 1990. Up to and including 2019, 
10,817 publications were identified, of which more than two in three did not 
contain any reference to costs or QALYs. In 2019, a total of 1409 manuscripts 
were identified, of which 239 were specifically for EQ-5D-5L.  Four hundred and 
seven (28.9%) included some form of 'costs' and 157 (11.1%) both 'costs' AND 
'QALYs' terms. For EQ-5D-5L, the corresponding numbers were 104 (43.5%) and 29 
(12.1%), respectively. After manually checking all the 1409 papers, three were 
duplicated records, which were omitted. In the remaining 1406 papers, only 40 
(2.8%) contained the term 'cost', but not 'cost per QALY', and only 117 (8.3%) 
were identifiable as economic evaluations using the term 'cost per QALY'. Most 
non-economic use of EQ-5D was as a quality-of-life outcome measure (72.8%). 
Other applications were: as a tool for methodological research (6.7%); 
comparison studies (3.7%); EQ-5D methodological issues (3.5%); containing costs 
but not QALYs (2.8%); mapping (1.3%); value sets (0.4%); and other papers 
(0.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the studies retrieved, covering a wide variety of 
research areas, reported upon the non-economic use of EQ-5D. Despite being the 
most-used instrument worldwide for QALY calculations, economic appraisal 
accounted for only a small, but important, part of published use.

OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to develop an algorithm that mapping the 
Haem-A-QoL scores to EQ-5D-5L utility scores in patients with hemophilia in 
China.
METHODS: A national sample of 862 patients with hemophilia completed both the 
EQ-5D-5L and Haem-A-QoL instruments. Eight regression models were selected to 
develop the mapping algorithm, they were: the ordinary least squares, general 
linear regression, Tobit regression, censored least absolute deviation, mixture 
beta regression, adjusted limited dependent variable mixture, the two-part, and 
robust MM-estimator model. Root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error 
(MAE), and R-square (R2) calculated using the tenfold cross-validation and 
random sample validation methods were used to assess the predictive ability of 
the models.
RESULTS: Based on RMSE, MAE, and R2, the mixture beta regression model with 
selected Haem-A-QoL subscale scores as the predicted variables showed the best 
performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our mapping algorithm bolsters the calculation of QALYs while 
conducting an economic evaluation of hemophilia-related interventions when only 
Haem-A-QoL data are available. The external validity of the algorithm should be 
further assessed in the other populations.

The objective of this study was to identify the age-related peculiarities of the 
coordinated motor response and voluntary shift of the center of gravity (COG) in 
females aged 85-95. A total of 68 women within the age range of 85-95 were 
screened, mean age (М±SD) - 89,3±3. The first group comprised 37 women between 
the chronological ages of 85 and 89 (mean age: 86,9±1,6). The second group 
included 31 women aged 90-95 (mean age: 92,1±1,4). To achieve the stated 
objective the computer dynamic posturographic complex Smart Equitest Balance 
Manager (USA) was used. The following tests were conducted: Motor Control Test 
(MCT), Rhythmic Weight Shift Test (RWS). The tests revealed a decreasing 
Composite of all Latencies (p=0,009) in the majority of the surveyed women aged 
90-95. However, a comparative analysis of the RWS test results showed no 
statistically significant differences between the age groups. Cause and effect 
relationships between the RWS test results and subjective perception of aging 
were established. Women aged 90-95 demonstrated no decrease in the speed of the 
voluntary shift and effective control of COG in frontal and sagittal planes, 
whereas the latency of their coordinated motor response was marked by reliably 
low numbers compared to women aged 85-89. Thus, women after 89 experience no 
age-related alterations in sensorimotor integration, which could be regarded as 
a predictor of longevity. The results obtained made it possible to outline the 
MCT and RWS parameters which can be taken into consideration in forecasting 
postural alterations and life expectancy for older women.

Publisher: Цель работы — установить возрастные особенности скоординированных 
моторных реакций и целенаправленного движения центра тяжести (ЦТ) у женщин 85–95 
лет. Были обследованы 68 женщин 85–95 лет (средний возраст — 89,3±3 года), 
которых разделили на две возрастные группы: 1-я — 37 женщин 85–89 лет (средний 
возраст — 86,9±1,6 года); 2-я — 31 женщина 90–95 лет (средний возраст — 92,1±1,4 
года). Для реализации поставленной цели использовали компьютерный динамический 
постурографический (стабилометрический) комплекс «Smart Equitest Balance 
Manager» (США). Проводили следующие тесты: Motor Control Test (MCT) и тест 
Rhythmic Weight Shift (RWS). У большинства обследованных женщин 90–95 лет 
выявлено снижение композитной оценки латентности всего MCT (Composite of all 
Latencies), p=0,009. При этом сравнительный анализ теста RWS не выявил 
статистически значимых различий между возрастными группами. Установлены 
причинно-следственные связи показателей теста RWS и уровня возрастной 
самооценки. У женщин 90–95 лет не наблюдали снижения скорости целенаправленного 
движения и эффективного управления ЦТ во фронтальном и сагиттальном 
направлениях, при этом латентность скоординированных моторных реакций 
характеризовалась достоверно низкими значениями по сравнению с женщинами 85–89 
лет. Таким образом, у женщин после 89 лет не происходит возрастных изменений 
процесса сенсомоторной интеграции, что также можно рассматривать как предиктор 
долгожительства. Полученные результаты позволили обозначить параметры MCT и 
теста RWS, которые можно учитывать при прогнозировании постуральных изменений и 
продолжительности жизни у женщин в старческом возрасте.

Experiences of Health Insurance among American Indian Elders and Their Health 
Care Providers.

CONTEXT: American Indian elders have a lower life expectancy than other aging 
populations in the United States because of inequities in health and in access 
to health care. To reduce such disparities, the 2010 Affordable Care Act 
included provisions to increase insurance enrollment among American Indians. 
Although the Indian Health Service remains underfunded, increases in insured 
rates have had significant impacts among American Indians and their health care 
providers.
METHODS: From June 2016 to March 2017, we conducted qualitative interviews with 
96 American Indian elders (age 55+) and 47 professionals (including health care 
providers, outreach workers, public-sector administrators, and tribal leaders) 
in two southwestern states. Interviews focused on elders' experiences with 
health care and health insurance. We analyzed transcripts iteratively using open 
and focused coding techniques.
FINDINGS: Although tribal health programs have benefitted from insurance 
payments, the complexities of selecting, qualifying for, and maintaining health 
insurance are often profoundly alienating and destabilizing for American Indian 
elders and communities.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the inadequacy of health-system reforms based 
on the expansion of private and individual insurance plans in ameliorating 
health disparities among American Indian elders. Policy makers must not neglect 
their responsibility to directly fund health care for American Indians.

Background After total hip arthroplasty, dislocation can occur when a patient 
unexpectedly assumes internal/external limb positions, even during chair-rising, 
which is a frequently activity of daily life. Therefore, determining the target 
cup position to avoid impingement in unexpected limb positions using in vivo 
data of daily life activities is critical. Methods A computer simulation was 
performed on 21 total hip arthroplasty patients using patient-specific component 
placements and hip kinematics obtained during chair-rising analysis using 
image-matching techniques. The liner-to-neck distance and impingement were 
evaluated by simulating the change in internal/external rotation angle at 
maximum hip flexion/extension from 0 to 90°. The cutoff values of cup 
anteversion and combined anteversion at 60° of internal/external rotation were 
determined. Findings The anterior/posterior liner-to-neck distances were 
negatively correlated with internal/external rotation angles (r = -0.82 and 
-0.78, respectively) and decreased by 1.7 and 1.8 mm for every 15° increase, 
respectively. Three cases (14%) of anterior/posterior impingement were observed 
at 60° of internal/external rotation angle, respectively. The cutoff values for 
cup anteversion and combined anteversion to avoid impingement at 60° of 
internal/external rotation angle were 12°-25°/38°-62°, respectively. The stem 
anteversion, adjustable by cup anteversion to meet both the target cup 
anteversion and combined anteversion, was 13°-50°. Interpretation Simulated 
unintentional internal or external hip rotation, even during chair-rising, 
caused impingement and posed a dislocation risk. If the stem anteversion is 
excessively small or large in meeting the target combined anteversion, 
adjustments to stem anteversion could be recommended in addition to adjustments 
in cup anteversion.

This study aimed to analyze the benefits of a lower-limb fast-velocity 
concentric resistance training on rate of force development, mobility, and 
quality of life in people with Multiple Sclerosis. A randomized controlled trial 
was conducted in 30 people with Multiple Sclerosis, who were randomly assigned 
to either an experimental (n=18) or a control (n=12) group. The experimental 
group carried out 10-weeks of fast-velocity concentric resistance training, 
while the control group did not perform any intervention. Early and late rate of 
force development during knee extension in both legs, sit-to-stand and Timed Up 
and Go tests and quality life questionnaire were evaluated before and after 
intervention. The training program evoked an increase in early rate of force 
development in experimental group (0-30; Rightleg: 63.9%, p<0.001; ES=-1.4; 
Leftleg: 52.7%, p<0.001; ES=-1.0) compared to control group (showed modest 
increases). Furthermore, experimental group improved mobility after training 
(Sit-to-stand: 22.2%, p<0.001; ES=1.0; Timed Up and Go Test: 10.1%, p<0.001; 
ES=1.1) and increased the perception of quality of life after training, while 
control showed no changes. The fast-velocity concentric resistance training has 
the potential to improve early rate of force development and mobility after 
10-weeks of training. In addition, the increase in self-perceived quality of 
life following this training modality demonstrates promising results in the 
Multiple Sclerosis population.

AIMS: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) with dual-mobility components (DM-THA) has 
been shown to decrease the risk of dislocation in the setting of a displaced 
neck of femur fracture compared to conventional single-bearing THA (SB-THA). 
This study assesses if the clinical benefit of a reduced dislocation rate can 
justify the incremental cost increase of DM-THA compared to SB-THA.
METHODS: Costs and benefits were established for patients aged 75 to 79 years 
over a five-year time period in the base case from the Canadian Health Payer's 
perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessed the 
robustness of the base case model conclusions.
RESULTS: DM-THA was found to be cost-effective, with an estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAD $46,556 (£27,074) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis revealed DM-THA was not cost-effective 
across all age groups in the first two years. DM-THA becomes cost-effective for 
those aged under 80 years at time periods from five to 15 years, but was not 
cost-effective for those aged 80 years and over at any timepoint. To be 
cost-effective at ten years in the base case, DM-THA must reduce the risk of 
dislocation compared to SB-THA by at least 62%. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed DM-THA was 58% likely to be cost-effective in the base case.
CONCLUSION: Treating patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture using 
DM-THA components may be cost-effective compared to SB-THA in patients aged 
under 80 years. However, future research will help determine if the modelled 
rates of adverse events hold true. Surgeons should continue to use clinical 
judgement and consider individual patients' physiological age and risk factors 
for dislocation. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2021;103-B(12):1783-1790.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a single treatment session of 
acupuncture, when applied in addition to usual care for acute low back pain 
(ALBP).
METHODS: Secondary analysis of a multicentre randomised controlled trial in 
Norwegian general practice. In total, 171 participants with ALBP ⩽14 days were 
randomised to a control group (CG) receiving usual care or to an acupuncture 
group (AG) receiving one additional session of Western medical acupuncture 
alongside usual care. Primary outcome measures for this cost-effectiveness 
analysis were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health care costs and 
societal costs at days 28 and 365, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) and net monetary benefit (NMB). The NMB was calculated on the basis of 
the Norwegian cost-effectiveness threshold of NOK 275,000 (USD 35,628) per QALY 
gained. Missing data were replaced by multiple chained imputation.
RESULTS: Eighty-six participants in the CG and 81 in the AG were included in the 
analysis. We found no QALY gain at day 28. At day 365, the incremental QALY of 
0.035 was statistically significant. The differences in health care costs and 
societal costs were not statistically significant. Three out of four 
calculations led to negative ICERs (cost saving) and positive NMBs. For the 
health care perspective at day 365, the ICER was USD -568 per QALY and the NMB 
was USD 1265, with 95.9% probability of acupuncture being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of 
acupuncture for ALBP. The findings indicate that acupuncture may be 
cost-effective from a 1-year perspective, but more studies are needed.

BACKGROUND: The number of older adults in residential aged care is increasing. 
Aged care residents have been shown to spend most of the day sedentary and have 
many co-morbidities. This review aimed to systematically explore the 
effectiveness of reablement strategies in residential aged care for older 
adults' physical function, quality of life and mental health, the features of 
effective interventions and feasibility (compliance, acceptability, adverse 
events and cost effectiveness).
METHOD: This scoping review was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines 
(extension for scoping reviews). Five e-databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
and CINAHL) were searched from 2010 onwards. Randomised controlled trials 
investigating reablement strategies addressing physical deconditioning for older 
adults (mean age ≥ 65 yrs) in residential aged care on physical function, 
quality of life or mental health were included. Feasibility of the interventions 
(compliance, acceptability, satisfaction, adverse events and cost effectiveness) 
was explored.
RESULTS: Five thousand six hundred thirty-one citations were retrieved, and 63 
studies included. Sample sizes ranged from 15 to 322 and intervention duration 
from one to 12 months. Exercise sessions were most often conducted two to three 
times per week (44 studies) and physiotherapist-led (27 studies). Interventions 
were predominately multi-component (28 studies, combinations of strength, 
balance, aerobic, functional exercises). Five interventions used technology. 60% 
of studies measuring physical function reported significant improvement in the 
intervention versus control, 40% of studies measuring quality of life reported 
significant improvements in favour of the intervention, and 26% of studies 
measuring mental health reported significant intervention benefits. Over half of 
the studies measured compliance and adverse events, four measured acceptability 
and none reported cost effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a research surge investigating reablement strategies 
in residential aged care with wide variability in the types and features of 
strategies and outcome measures. Few studies have measured acceptability, or 
cost effectiveness. Exploration of core outcomes, mapping stakeholders and 
co-designing a scalable intervention is warranted.

Hand burns are common injuries that can result in long-term impairment of hand 
function. Enzymatic debridement (ED) prevents damage to the viable dermis due to 
the procedure's selectivity and has become an option for obtaining an accurate 
depth assessment and enabling wound re-epithelialization with less skin graft
