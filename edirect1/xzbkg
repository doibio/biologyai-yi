Trauma is the leading cause of death in people below 45 years-old in Brazil, and 
responsible for one third of all intensive care unit admissions. The increasing 
knowledge on ultrasound diagnosis methods and its availability for 
life-threatening injuries (such as cardiac tamponade and abdominal cavity solid 
organs rupture leading to hemorrhagic shock) diagnosis and monitoring, lead to 
the development o the FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) 
protocol, aimed to be used both in the emergency and intensive care unit 
settings. Due to its reproducibility, lack of radiation exposure, and bedside 
feasibility, this technology is being increasingly accepted. A new protocol 
extension, the Extended-FAST, provides valuable information for improved 
patients' management, extending its availability from the abdominal conditions 
to other diagnosis such as hemothorax, pleural effusion and pneumothorax. We 
must underline that this technique is able to replace computed tomography and 
diagnostic peritoneal wash, and do not delay surgical procedure instead of 
perform this exam . Thus, its careful appraisal in connection with the clinical 
information should guide the therapeutic approaches, specially in inhospitable 
sites such as intensive care units in war zones, rural or distant places, were 
other imagery methods are not available.

Louise Coote Lupus Unit , Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7EH , UK.

INTRODUCTION: Belimumab is a fully humanised mAb against B lymphocyte stimulator 
(B-LyS). It is the first biological drug to be licensed and approved by the US 
FDA and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency for use in combination with 
standard immunosuppressants in autoantibody-positive systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). The clinical effectiveness and impact of this drug on lupus 
morbidity and mortality is evaluated in this review.
AREAS COVERED: An overview of the efficacy and safety of belimumab based on 
7-year longitudinal continuation study data from SLE patients enrolled in the 
Phase II double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 52-week study of 
belimumab 1, 4 and 10 mg/kg doses and an overview of the open-label 24-week 
extension of belimumab plus standard immunosuppressant therapy. A review of the 
current belimumab clinical trials, the experience of belimumab in real-world 
settings and a description of the impact that belimumab has had on the 
healthcare quality of life of SLE patients.
EXPERT OPINION: The emerging clinical data have shed light on the areas in which 
belimumab is of greatest benefit and areas for further evaluation in clinical 
trials. It is anticipated that regular updates from ongoing trials of belimumab 
in SLE, practising physicians, data from the continuation arms of clinical 
trials and data from international biologics registries will have an influence 
on the role of belimumab in the management of SLE.

Music therapy for service users with dementia: a critical review of the 
literature.

Manchester, UK.

Dementia is an organic mental health problem that has been estimated to affect 
over 23 million people worldwide. With increasing life expectancy in most 
countries, it has been estimated that the prevalence of dementia will continue 
to significantly increase in the next two decades. Dementia leads to cognitive 
impairments most notably short-term memory loss and impairments in functioning 
and quality of life (QOL). National policy in the UK advocates the importance of 
early diagnosis, treatment and social inclusion in maintaining a good QOL. 
First-line treatment options often involve drug therapies aimed at slowing down 
the progression of the illness and antipsychotic medication to address 
challenging behaviours. To date, research into non-pharmacological interventions 
has been limited. In this manuscript, we review the literature that has reported 
evaluations of the effects of music therapy, a non-pharmacological intervention. 
The results of six studies reviewed suggest that music therapy may have 
potential benefits in reducing anxiety, depression and agitated behaviour 
displayed by elderly people with dementia as well as improving cognitive 
functioning and QOL. Furthermore, music therapy is a safe and low-cost 
intervention that could potentially be offered by mental health nurses and other 
carers working in residential settings.

Putting the Patient in Patient Reported Outcomes: A Robust Methodology for 
Health Outcomes Assessment.

McCarthy IM(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Economics, Emory University Atlanta, GA, USA.

When analyzing many health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes, statistical 
inference is often based on the summary score formed by combining the individual 
domains of the HRQoL profile into a single measure. Through a series of Monte 
Carlo simulations, this paper illustrates that reliance solely on the summary 
score may lead to biased estimates of incremental effects, and I propose a novel 
two-stage approach that allows for unbiased estimation of incremental effects. 
The proposed methodology essentially reverses the order of the analysis, from 
one of 'aggregate, then estimate' to one of 'estimate, then aggregate'. Compared 
to relying solely on the summary score, the approach also offers a more 
patient-centered interpretation of results by estimating regression coefficients 
and incremental effects in each of the HRQoL domains, while still providing 
estimated effects in terms of the overall summary score. I provide an 
application to the estimation of incremental effects of demographic and clinical 
variables on HRQoL following surgical treatment for adult scoliosis and spinal 
deformity.

RNA structure is a primary determinant of its function, and methods that merge 
chemical probing with next generation sequencing have created breakthroughs in 
the throughput and scale of RNA structure characterization. However, little work 
has been done to examine the effects of library preparation and sequencing on 
the measured chemical probe reactivities that encode RNA structural information. 
Here, we present the first analysis and optimization of these effects for 
selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing 
(SHAPE-Seq). We first optimize SHAPE-Seq, and show that it provides highly 
reproducible reactivity data over a wide range of RNA structural contexts with 
no apparent biases. As part of this optimization, we present SHAPE-Seq v2.0, a 
'universal' method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide 
of an RNA without having to use or introduce a specific reverse transcriptase 
priming site within the RNA. We show that SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is highly reproducible, 
with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in RNA folding algorithms 
to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other SHAPE 
methods. We anticipate SHAPE-Seq v2.0 to be broadly applicable to understanding 
the RNA sequence-structure relationship at the heart of some of life's most 
fundamental processes.

Comment in
    Lancet Glob Health. 2014 Sep;2(9):e493-4.

BACKGROUND: Avahan is a large-scale, HIV preventive intervention, targeting 
high-risk populations in south India. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
Avahan to inform global and national funding institutions who are considering 
investing in worldwide HIV prevention in concentrated epidemics.
METHODS: We estimated cost effectiveness from a programme perspective in 22 
districts in four high-prevalence states. We used the UNAIDS Costing Guidelines 
for HIV Prevention Strategies as the basis for our costing method, and 
calculated effect estimates using a dynamic transmission model of HIV and 
sexually transmitted disease transmission that was parameterised and fitted to 
locally observed behavioural and prevalence trends. We calculated incremental 
cost-effective ratios (ICERs), comparing the incremental cost of Avahan per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted versus a no-Avahan counterfactual 
scenario. We also estimated incremental cost per HIV infection averted and 
incremental cost per person reached.
FINDINGS: Avahan reached roughly 150 000 high-risk individuals between 2004 and 
2008 in the 22 districts studied, at a mean cost per person reached of US$327 
during the 4 years. This reach resulted in an estimated 61 000 HIV infections 
averted, with roughly 11 000 HIV infections averted in the general population, 
at a mean incremental cost per HIV infection averted of $785 (SD 166). We 
estimate that roughly 1 million DALYs were averted across the 22 districts, at a 
mean incremental cost per DALY averted of $46 (SD 10). Future antiretroviral 
treatment (ART) cost savings during the lifetime of the cohort exposed to HIV 
prevention were estimated to be more than $77 million (compared with the 
slightly more than $50 million spent on Avahan in the 22 districts during the 4 
years of the study).
INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that the investment in targeted HIV 
prevention programmes in south India has been cost effective, and is likely to 
be cost saving if a commitment is made to provide ART to all that can benefit 
from it. Policy makers should consider funding and sustaining large-scale 
targeted HIV prevention programmes in India and beyond.

Clinical decision-making tools for exam selection, reporting and dose tracking.

Although many efforts have been made to reduce the radiation dose associated 
with individual medical imaging examinations to "as low as reasonably 
achievable," efforts to ensure such examinations are performed only when 
medically indicated and appropriate are equally if not more important. 
Variations in the use of ionizing radiation for medical imaging are concerning, 
regardless of whether they occur on a local, regional or national basis. Such 
variations among practices can be reduced with the use of decision support tools 
at the time of order entry. These tools help reduce radiation exposure among 
practices through the appropriate use of medical imaging. Similarly, adoption of 
best practices among imaging facilities can be promoted through tracking the 
radiation exposure among imaging patients. Practices can benchmark their 
aggregate radiation exposures for medical imaging through the use of dose index 
registries. However several variables must be considered when contemplating 
individual patient dose tracking. The specific dose measures and the variation 
among them introduced by variations in body habitus must be understood. Moreover 
the uncertainties in risk estimation from dose metrics related to age, gender 
and life expectancy must also be taken into account.

From 'Image Gently' to image intelligently: a personalized perspective on 
diagnostic radiation risk.

The risk of ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging has been a popular topic 
in the radiology literature and lay press. Communicating the magnitude of risk 
to patients and caregivers is problematic because of the uncertainty in 
estimates derived principally from epidemiological studies of large populations, 
and alternative approaches are needed to provide a scientific basis for 
personalized risk estimates. The underlying patient disease and life expectancy 
greatly influence risk projections. Research into the biological mechanisms of 
radiation-induced DNA damage and repair challenges the linear no-threshold 
dose-response assumption and reveals that individuals vary in sensitivity to 
radiation. Studies of decision-making psychology show that individuals are 
highly susceptible to irrational biases when judging risks. Truly informed 
medical decision-making that respects patient autonomy requires appropriate 
framing of radiation risks in perspective with other risks and with the benefits 
of imaging. To follow the principles of personalized medicine and treat patients 
according to their specific phenotypic and personality profiles, diagnostic 
imaging should optimally be tailored not only to patient size, body region and 
clinical indication, but also to underlying disease conditions, 
radio-sensitivity and risk perception and preferences that vary among 
individuals.

The communication of the radiation risk from CT in relation to its clinical 
benefit in the era of personalized medicine: part 2: benefits versus risk of CT.

Westra SJ(1).

St., White 246A, Boston, MA, 02114, USA, swestra@partners.org.

In order to personalize the communication of the CT risk, we need to describe 
the risk in the context of the clinical benefit of CT, which will generally be 
much higher, provided a CT scan has a well-established clinical indication. 
However as pediatric radiologists we should be careful not to overstate the 
benefit of CT, being aware that medico-legal pressures and the realities of 
health care economics have led to overutilization of the technology. And even 
though we should not use previously accumulated radiation dose to a child as an 
argument against conducting a clinically indicated scan (the "sunk-cost" bias), 
we should consider patients' radiation history in the diagnostic decision 
process. As a contribution to future public health, it makes more sense to look 
for non-radiating alternatives to CT in the much larger group of basically 
healthy children who are receiving occasional scans for widely prevalent 
conditions such as appendicitis and trauma than to attempt lowering CT use in 
the smaller group of patients with chronic conditions with a limited life 
expectancy. When communicating the CT risk with individual patients and their 
parents, we should acknowledge and address their concerns within the framework 
of informed decision-making. When appropriate, we may express the individual 
radiation risk, based on estimates of summated absorbed organ dose, as an order 
of magnitude rather than as an absolute number, and compare this with the much 
larger natural cancer incidence over a child's lifetime, and with other risks in 
medicine and daily life. We should anticipate that many patients cannot make 
informed decisions on their own in this complex matter, and we should offer our 
guidance while maintaining respect for patient autonomy. Proper documentation of 
the informed decision process is important for future reference. In concert with 
our referring physicians, pediatric radiologists are well-equipped to tackle the 
complexities associated with the communication of CT risk, a task that often 
falls upon us, and by becoming more involved in the diagnostic decision process 
we can add value to the health care system.

The role of tau protein in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.

Given the increased life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infected individuals treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and 
the ongoing inflammation observed in the brains of these patients, it is likely 
that premature neurodegeneration as measured by phospho-tau (p-tau) or increased 
total tau (t-tau) protein may become an increasing problem. This review examines 
the seven human studies that have occurred over the past 14 years measuring 
p-tau and/or t-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or via post-mortem brain 
immunohistochemistry. Although not all studies are in agreement as to the 
changes in p-and t-tau in HIV infected patients, HIV persists in the brain 
despite cART. Thus is it is suggested that those maintained on long-term cART 
may develop tau pathology beyond the extent seen in the studies reviewed herein 
and overtime may then reach the threshold for clinical manifestation.

Conventional diagnostic X-ray units are used for radiographic imaging in several 
countries. As a part of our quality control procedures, we recorded entrance 
surface air kerma, tube voltage, and half-value layer measurements for four 
diagnostic X-ray tubes over a 108 week course. The entrance surface air kerma 
for one of the X-ray tubes suddenly declined in the 107th week, and the filament 
burned out 1 week later. We retrospectively reviewed these data and observed 
that the entrance surface air kerma of the failing tube had increased as a 
function of elapsed time. The slopes for these four X-ray units were calculated, 
and we observed that the slope of the failing tube was higher than that of the 
other three tubes (P < 0.001). Monitoring of the fluctuation in the entrance 
surface air kerma would be valuable for predicting the residual life expectancy 
of X-ray tubes.

The dynamics of D-dimer level fluctuation in patients after the cemented and 
cementless total hip and total knee replacement.

INTRODUCTION: The number of total hip and total knee replacement procedures 
performed worldwide has tended to surge in recent years, due to the combination 
of such factors as the increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, 
advances in medical technology as well as pre-operative and post-operative 
patient management.Numerous studies confirm that patients undergoing major 
orthopaedics procedures involving lower extremities, for instance total hip and 
total knee replacement, constitute the highest risk group for the development of 
post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE), primarily manifested as deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT).
PURPOSE: The purpose of the research was to assess the dynamics of D-dimer level 
fluctuation during the post-operative period in patients after the cemented or 
cementless total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR), in order 
to prove or reject the thesis that the cemented and cementless THR or TKR 
affects the post-operative D-dimer levels.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 47 patients aged 29-82 years. 
Of them, 23 had the cementless THR, 12 subjects had the cemented THR and another 
12 patients had the TKR. All of the patients performed to measure the 
concentration of D-dimers in the peri-operative period at predetermined time 
points. For the peri-operative period was adopted from time 1 day before surgery 
to 10-day hospitalization. The subarachnoid block (SAB) was performed in all 
patients.
RESULTS: The distribution of D-dimer values throughout the entire post-operative 
period (up to 10th post-operative day) followed the sinusoid pattern with two 
peaks in all patients. It was not specific in any group.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. The D-dimer level almost doubles during the post-operative 
period in patients after THR or TKR.2. Higher level of D-dimers in 
post-operative period in the research group of patients does not relate to 
higher risk of thromboembolic disease.

AIM: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of starting insulin 
therapy with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) in people with type 2 
diabetes inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering drugs in Saudi Arabia, 
India, Indonesia, and Algeria.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to evaluate economic outcomes 
associated with starting BIAsp 30, using baseline characteristics and treatment 
outcomes from the A(1)chieve study. Time horizons of 1 and 30 years were 
applied, with country-specific costs for complications, therapies, and 
background mortality. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are 
expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in local currencies, 
USD, and fractions of local GDP per capita (GDPc). Cost-effectiveness was 
pre-defined using the World Health Organization definition of <3.0 times GDPc. 
Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the primary 30-year analyses, starting BIAsp 30 was associated with 
a projected increase in life expectancy of >1 year and was highly 
cost-effective, with ICERs of -0.03 (Saudi Arabia), 0.25 (India), 0.48 (India), 
0.47 (Indonesia), and 0.46 (Algeria) GDPc/QALY. The relative risk of developing 
selected complications was reduced in all countries. Sensitivity analyses 
including cost of self-monitoring, treatment costs, and deterioration of glucose 
control with time showed the results to be robust. In a 1-year analysis, ICER 
per QALY gained was still cost-effective or highly cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Starting BIAsp 30 in people with type 2 diabetes in the A(1)chieve 
study was found to be cost-effective across all country settings at 1- and 
30-year time horizons, and usefully increased predicted life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: For decades, the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases 
(CVDs) have declined. More recently, we have seen a halting in these declines, 
especially at younger ages. It is difficult to predict how these changing trends 
will impact CVD prevalence. We aimed to predict future prevalence of CVDs in 
Western Australian adults from 2005-2045 based on current incidence and 
mortality probabilities, population growth and ageing.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Multi-state life table models were developed using 
2005-2009 age- and sex-specific incidence and mortality probabilities from the 
Western Australian Data Linkage System. Prevalence of CVD, coronary heart 
disease (CHD) and stroke was projected until 2045. Life expectancy and lifetime 
risk were estimated. We estimate that compared to 2005-2009, we will see 37,235 
(CVD), 23,129 (CHD) and 9806 (stroke) more incident cases in 2040-2044. The 
prevalence of total CVD is predicted to increase from 8.4% in men and 5.1% in 
women in 2005 to 12.7% and 7.9% respectively in 2045. This seems to be mainly 
due to population growth and ageing, with some effect of changing incidence and 
mortality. In Western Australia this represents an additional 106,949 adults 
living with CVD, of which 65,951 with CHD and 10,928 with stroke, in 2045 
compared to 2005.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming no major changes in prevention and treatment of CVD, the 
prevalence will likely increase, with consequent increases in health care need 
and cost. These findings need to be confirmed by studies in which prevalence is 
consistently and empirically measured and monitored over time.

Ageing is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to major pathologies 
(atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, 
cataract, and osteoporosis) which can have similar underlying pathoetiologies. 
All of these diseases involve oxidative stress, inflammation and/or cell death 
processes, which are triggered by cholesterol oxide derivatives, also named 
oxysterols. These oxidized lipids result either from spontaneous and/or 
enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol on the steroid nucleus or on the side chain. 
The ability of oxysterols to induce severe dysfunctions in organelles 
(especially mitochondria) plays key roles in RedOx homeostasis, inflammatory 
status, lipid metabolism, and in the control of cell death induction, which may 
at least in part contribute to explain the potential participation of these 
molecules in ageing processes and in age related diseases. As no efficient 
treatments are currently available for most of these diseases, which are 
predicted to become more prevalent due to the increasing life expectancy and 
average age, a better knowledge of the biological activities of the different 
oxysterols is of interest, and constitutes an important step toward 
identification of pharmacological targets for the development of new therapeutic 
strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous stabilization (PS; percutaneous flexible nailing and 
intramedullary bone cement injection) was performed at lower extremity long 
bones in patients with multiple bone metastases with short life expectancy to 
get mechanical stability and local tumor control. We evaluated the usefulness of 
PS by clinical status, F-18-FDG PET-CT and bone scintigraphy (BS).
METHODS: Patients comprised 15 patients (total 20 sites) who had undergone PS 
for the metastatic bone tumors of lower extremity long bones (femur and tibia). 
After percutaneous flexible nailing, bone cement was injected (mean 
amount=15.5±6.4 ml). Patients' clinical status was evaluated by visual analog 
scale (VAS). Qualitative assessment of PET-CT and BS was categorized by 
improved, stable and aggravated states of PS lesion. Quantitative assessment of 
PET-CT was performed by maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and 
SUVmean).
RESULTS: PS was performed in all of the patients without complication, and 
showed significant pain improvement of VAS (7.2±0.2 vs. 2.8±0.3, P<0.001). PS 
lesion showed improved state in 65% (13/20) and stable state in 35% (7/20). 
However, naive bony metastatic lesion showed mostly aggravated state in 90% 
(19/20) in the same patients, which was significantly different compared with PS 
lesion (P<0.001). In PS lesion, SUVmax (10.1±6.9 vs. 7.1±5.2, P=0.008) and 
SUVmean (6.2±4.8 vs. 4.6±3.7, P=0.008) showed significantly decreased uptake 
after PS.
CONCLUSION: By PS in lower extremity long bones, patients can reduce regional 
pain, and has the possibility of local tumor control. PS can be performed for 
lower extremity bone metastasis in poor general condition to perform 
conventional intramedullary nailing.

BACKGROUND: Dosing chemotherapy based on BSA results in marked interindividual 
variability in drug exposure. A randomized trial showed increased OS and 
decreased toxicity with PK-guided compared with BSA-based 5-FU dosing in 
patients with mCRC. The objective of this study was to compare the cost 
effectiveness of PK-based 5-FU dosing with BSA-based 5-FU dosing in patients 
with mCRC receiving FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of PK FOLFOX compared with BSA FOLFOX. Progression risks and 
cause-specific mortality were extrapolated from the fitted survival models. 
Costs for administration and management of adverse events were estimated based 
on 2013 Medicare reimbursement rates and average sale prices.
RESULTS: PK FOLFOX provided 2.03 QALYs at a cost of $50,205 compared with BSA 
FOLFOX, which provided 1.46 QALYs at a cost of $37,173. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $22,695 per QALY. The ICER remained < 
$50,000 per QALY in all univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: At a $50,000 per QALY threshold, PK FOLFOX is cost effective for 
mCRC. Because of the cost effectiveness profile and OS advantage with PK FOLFOX, 
it should be evaluated further in comparative effectiveness studies.

[Rapid increase in maximal country specific life expectancy across cohorts].

[Article in Russian]

Shkol'nikov VM, Zhdanov DA, Andreev EM, Vopel' DV.

Linear increase in the best-practice (maximal among countries) life expectancy, 
known as the Oeppen-Vaupel line, is the most demonstrative image of longevity 
progress. This study is devoted to the analysis of trends in best-practice life 
expectancy across cohorts born in 1870 to 1950. Other than the conventional 
period life expectancy, cohort life expectancy measures the lifetime of real 
individuals from the population under consideration. Since mortality is mostly 
decreasing with time, period life expectancy in a given year is usually lower 
than cohort life expectancy for people born in the same year. The corresponding 
gap between period and cohort life expectancies increases with time. Our 
analysis is based on data for 24 developed countries from the Human Mortality 
Database for the period 1870 to 2008. To estimate life expectancy for 
non-extinct cohorts, we apply the Lee-Carter model to extrapolate mortality 
rates until the year 2050. The annual increase in the best-practice cohort life 
expectancy across cohorts born in 1870 to 1950 is 0,43 year, while the annual 
increment in the period life expectancy across the same range of years is equal 
to 0,28 year. The best-practice cohort life expectancy has increased from 53,7 
years in 1870 to 83,8 years in 1950. During this time the gap between period and 
cohort life expectancies has increased from 1,2 to 10,3 years. Cohorts born in 
1920 to 1950 will live longer than one can expect by looking at respective 
period mortality patterns. For these cohorts, the longest part of their 
additionally gained lifetime will be spent at ages 65 and older. This 
substantially changes the distribution of human lifetime among different stages 
of the life cycle.

[Gender aspect of population aging in Russia].

[Article in Russian]

Safarova GL, Safarova AA, Lisenenkov AI.

Demographic aspects of gender differences in aging characteristics for Russian 
Federation and Saint-Petersburg, the greatest non-metropolitan Russian 
megalopolis, for the period 1990-2009 have been considered. Differences in the 
number and proportions of the elderly in the male and female populations, gender 
gap in life expectancies, gender differences in aging indicators which take 
account of remaining years of life have been examined. Results of the study 
demonstrate significant gender differences in aging characteristics. Gender 
imbalance should be taken into account when elaboration effective demographic, 
social and economic policies.

Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China.

Ankyrins (Ank) are a ubiquitously expressed family of multifunctional membrane 
adapter proteins. Ankyrin G (AnkG) is critical for assembling and maintenance of 
the axon initial segment. Here we present the 2.1 Å crystal structure of human 
AnkG death domain (hAnkG-DD). The core death domain is composed of six α-helices 
and three 3₁₀-helices. It forms a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the 
molecule. The C-terminal tail of the hAnkG-DD curves back to have the aromatic 
ring of a phenylalanine residue, Phe100 insert into this pocket, which anchors 
the flexible tail onto the core domain. Related DDs were selected for structure 
comparison. The major variations are at the C-terminal region, including the α6 
and the long C-terminal extension. The results of size exclusion chromatography 
and analytical ultracentrifugation suggest that hAnkG-DD exists as monomer in 
solution. Our work should help for the future investigation of the 
structure-function of AnkG.

Aortic valve stenosis is a common heart valve disorder in adults. Its prevalence 
increases with age and is therefore especially seen in older patients. Thirty to 
forty per cent of patients with symptomatic aortic valve stenosis are not 
referred for surgical valve replacement because of high age, their medical 
history or comorbidities. In 2002, the first transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) was carried out in an inoperable patient. Since 2012, TAVI 
has been included in international guidelines for heart valve diseases as a 
treatment strategy in symptomatic patients at a high risk of complications and a 
life expectancy of more than one year. Decision-making about which treatment is 
preferable takes a multidisciplinary approach. Important complications of TAVI 
are bleeding, renal function disorder, stroke, conduction abnormalities, valve 
insufficiency and death. TAVI procedures are carried out in the Netherlands only 
in cardiac centres in which specific expertise is present in the areas of 
structural cardiovascular disease. Scientific research is important for further 
developments and improvements.

BACKGROUND: Optimal use of retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters is an 
important health care issue, and despite an exponential rise in the use of 
retrievable IVC filters, national trends suggest that most of these filters are 
not removed. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated 
with nonretrieval of retrievable IVC filters at our institution.
METHODS: A retrospective institutional review of all patients undergoing IVC 
filter placement from June 2010 to June 2012 was performed. A number of patient 
parameters were studied, including relevant demographics, indication for filter 
placement, clinical history, related hospitalization, and whether filter 
retrieval was performed. Patient parameters were compared by univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: There were 605 retrievable IVC filters placed over a 24-month period by 
vascular surgery, intervention radiology, and interventional cardiology. The 
follow-up retrieval rate was 25%. By indication, 272 (45%), 53 (9%), and 280 
(46%) filters were placed for absolute, relative, and prophylactic indications, 
respectively. Independent predictors for nonretrieval by multivariate analysis 
were age >80 years (hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.7-20; P < 0.001), acute bleed (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-5; P < 0.001), current 
malignancy (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.3; P = 0.011), postfilter anticoagulation 
(HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.28-0.9; P = 0.017), and history of pulmonary embolism and/or 
venous thromboembolism (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.28-0.35; P < 0.001). Filter placement 
team and indication were not identified as independent predictors of 
nonretrieval of IVC filters.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient variables identified by univariate and multivariate 
analyses as risk for nonretrieval of retrievable IVC filters have several 
implications: first, some of these patients may represent a group of patients 
with a low life expectancy or unresolvable underlying condition in which filter 
retrieval has diminishing returns and may indicate the clinical option for 
permanence of the filter; second, identification of risk factors for 
nonretrieval in patients before filter placement will help to optimize use of 
retrievable IVC filters and enhance retrieval rates.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is among the major causes of disability worldwide and 
the mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly elevated. There 
is a growing concern that this health challenge is not fully understood and 
efficiently addressed.
METHODS: Non-systematic review using searches in PubMed on relevant topics as 
well as selection of references based on the authors' experience from clinical 
work and research in the field.
RESULTS: In most countries, the standardized mortality rate in schizophrenia is 
about 2.5, leading to a reduction in life expectancy between 15 and 20 years. A 
major contributor of the increased mortality is due to CVD, with CVD mortality 
ranging from 40 to 50% in most studies. Important causal factors are related to 
lifestyle, including poor diet, lack of physical activity, smoking, and 
substance abuse. Recent findings suggest that there are overlapping 
pathophysiology and genetics between schizophrenia and CVD-risk factors, further 
increasing the liability to CVD in schizophrenia. Many pharmacological agents 
used for treating psychotic disorders have side effects augmenting CVD risk. 
Although several CVD-risk factors can be effectively prevented and treated, the 
provision of somatic health services to people with schizophrenia seems 
inadequate. Further, there is a sparseness of studies investigating the effects 
of lifestyle interventions in schizophrenia, and there is little knowledge about 
effective programs targeting physical health in this population.
DISCUSSION: The risk for CVD and CVD-related deaths in people with schizophrenia 
is increased, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. Coordinated 
interventions in different health care settings could probably reduce the risk. 
There is an urgent need to develop and implement effective programs to increase 
life expectancy in schizophrenia, and we argue that mental health workers should 
be more involved in this important task.

This paper presents clusters of the world's countries obtained by a novel 
weighted clustering method. The approach is based on data representations with 
symbolic descriptions of age-sex structures. To obtain clusters with similar 
descriptions, a weighted clustering method is used which is suitable for data 
described with discrete distributions. In contrast to the classical approach, 
this method allows the population of each sex to be included in the clustering 
process, thereby obtaining a representative age-sex structure corresponding to 
all the countries contained in the cluster. Observing the data over time reveals 
clusters of countries with similar changes in their population age-sex 
distributions. The resulting population pyramids are presented for 1996, 2001, 
and 2006.

[Injecting drug abuse: survival after intensive care admission and forensic 
toxicology reports at death].

[Article in Icelandic]

Sigvaldason K, Ingvarsson T, Thordardottir S, Kristinsson J, Karason S.

INTRODUCTION: Injecting drug abuse is a worldwide problem with serious 
consequences for the individual and for society. The purpose of this study was 
to gather information on the most serious complications of injecting drug use 
from two perspectives, intensive care admissions and forensic toxicology 
reports.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Firstly, intensive care admissions related to injecting 
drug abuse during a five year period were reviewed for demographics,
