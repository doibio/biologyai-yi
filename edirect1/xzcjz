possible MFS treatment strategy, but interactions with TGF-β signaling remain 
elusive. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in TGF-β receptors 1 and 2 
(TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) cause LDS, but TGF-β signaling is activated in the aorta 
(referred to as the TGF-β paradox) by mechanisms yet to be elucidated. In this 
review, we present and discuss the current understanding of molecular mechanisms 
responsible for aortopathies of MFS and related disorders.

BACKGROUND: Mallet fracture can easily occur during sports activities or in 
daily life; however, the principles and methods of treatment for such fractures 
remain debated. Among the surgical treatments, various methods of closed 
reduction have been proposed. We treated patients with the extension block 
method (EBM) and the direct pinning method (DPM), and then compared the results. 
We assessed differences in range of motion and measurements of finger movement 
after surgery.
METHODS: A total of 41 patients who underwent surgery from August 2013 to 
September 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. Among them, 21 patients were 
treated with the EBM and 20 patients were treated with the DPM. We then compared 
extensor lag, range of motion, and outcomes according to Crawford's criteria 
between before surgery and at 6 to 8 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: The postoperative extensor lag improvement was 4.28° and 10.73°, and 
the postoperative arc of motion was 55.76° and 61.17° in the EBM and DPM groups, 
respectively. The Crawford assessment showed no statistically significant 
difference between the groups, although the score in the DPM group was higher 
than that in the EBM group (3.5 vs. 3.1).
CONCLUSIONS: As closed reduction methods for the treatment of mallet fracture, 
both the EBM and DPM showed good results. However, the DPM proved to be superior 
to the EBM in that it produced greater improvements in extensor lag and range of 
motion.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The global burden of disease (GBD) project measures 
the health of populations worldwide on an annual basis, and results are 
available by country. We used the estimates of the GBD to summarise the state of 
health in Spain in 2016 and report trends in mortality and morbidity from 1990 
to 2016.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: GBD 2016 estimated disease burden due to 333 diseases and 
injuries, and 84 risk factors. The GBD list of causes is hierarchical and 
includes 3 top level categories, namely: 1) communicable, maternal, neonatal, 
and nutritional diseases; 2) non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and 3) injuries. 
Mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), risk factors, and progress 
towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) are presented based on the GBD 
2016 data in Spain.
RESULTS: There were 418,516 deaths in Spain in 2016, from a total population of 
46.5 million, and 80.5% of them occurred in those aged 70 years and older. 
Overall, NCDs were the main cause of death: 388,617 (95% uncertainty interval 
374,959-402,486), corresponding to 92.8% of all deaths. They were followed by 
3.6% due to injuries with 15,052 (13,902-17,107) deaths, and 3.5% communicable 
diseases with 14,847 (13,208-16,482) deaths. The 5 leading specific causes of 
death were ischaemic heart disease (IHD, 14.6% of all deaths), Alzheimer disease 
and other dementias (13.6%), stroke (7.1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (6.9%), and lung cancer (5.0%). Remarkable increases in mortality from 
1990 to 2016 were observed in other cancers, lower respiratory infections, 
chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular disease, among others. On the 
contrary, road injuries moved down from 8th to 32nd position, and diabetes from 
6th to 10th. Low back and neck pain became the number one cause of DALYs in 
Spain in 2016, just surpassing IHD, while Alzheimer disease moved from 9th to 
3rd position. The greatest changes in DALYs were observed for road injuries 
dropping from 4th to 16th position, and congenital disorders from 17th to 35th; 
conversely, oral disorders rose from 25th to 17th. Overall, smoking is by far 
the most relevant risk factor in Spain, followed by high blood pressure, high 
body mass index, alcohol use, and high fasting plasma glucose. Finally, Spain 
scored 74.3 of 100 points in the SDG index classification in 2016, and the main 
national drivers of detrimental health in SDGs were alcohol consumption, smoking 
and child obesity. An increase to 80.3 points is projected in 2030.
CONCLUSION: Low back and neck pain was the most important contributor of 
disability in Spain in 2016. There has seen a remarkable increase in the burden 
due to Alzheimer disease and other dementias. Tobacco remains the most important 
health issue to address in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Although life expectancy has been projected to increase across 
high-income countries, gains for the USA are anticipated to be among the 
smallest, and overall US death rates actually increased from 2014 to 2015, with 
divergence for specific US populations. Therefore, projecting future premature 
mortality is essential for clinical and public health service planning, curbing 
rapidly increasing causes of death, and sustaining progress in declining causes 
of death. We aimed to project premature mortality (here defined as deaths of 
individuals aged 25-64 years) trends through 2030, and to estimate the total 
number of projected deaths, the projected number of potential years of life lost 
due to premature mortality, and the effect of reducing projected accidental 
death rates by 2% per year.
METHODS: We obtained death certificate data for the US population aged 25-64 
years for 1990-2015 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
National Center for Health Statistics. We obtained US mortality data for 2016 
for non-American Indian or Alaska native groups from CDC WONDER; data for 2016 
were not available for American Indians or Alaska natives. Our analysis focused 
on all-cause premature mortality and the commonest causes of premature death 
(cancer, heart disease, accidents, suicide, and chronic liver disease or 
cirrhosis) among white, black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific islanders, and 
American Indian or Alaska native men and women. We estimated age-standardised 
premature mortality and corresponding annual percentage changes for 2017-30 by 
sex and race or ethnic origin by use of age-period-cohort forecasting models. We 
also did a sensitivity analysis projecting future mortality from cross-sectional 
mortality and a JoinPoint of the (log) period rate ratio curve. We calculated 
absolute death counts by use of corresponding age-specific and year-specific US 
census population projections, and estimated years of potential life lost.
FINDINGS: During 2017-30, all-cause deaths are projected to increase among white 
women and American Indians or Alaska natives, resulting in 239 700 excess 
premature deaths relative to 2017 rates (a 10% increase). Mortality declines in 
white men and black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific islander men and women will 
result in 945 900 fewer deaths (a 14% reduction). Cancer mortality rates are 
projected to decline among white, black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific islander 
women and men, with the largest declines among black women (age-standardised 
premature mortality rate 2016: 104·5 deaths per 100 000 woman-years; 2030: 77·1 
per 100 000 woman-years) and men (2016: 116·8 per 100 000 man-years; 2030: 81·6 
per 100 000 man-years). Heart disease death rates are projected to increase in 
American Indian or Alaska native men (2015: 150·9 per 100 000 man-years; 2030: 
175·9 per 100 000 man-years) and decline in other groups, albeit only slightly 
in white (2016: 35·6 per 100 000 woman-years; 2030: 31·1 per 100 000 
woman-years) and American Indian or Alaska native women (2015: 64·4 per 100 000 
woman-years; 2030: 62·8 per 100 000 woman-years). Accidental death rates are 
projected to increase in all US populations except Asian or Pacific islander 
women, and will increase most rapidly among white women (2030: 60·5 per 100 000 
woman-years) and men (2030: 101·9 per 100 000 man-years) and American Indian or 
Alaska native women (2030: 97·5 per 100 000 woman-years) and men (2030: 298·7 
per 100 000 man-years). Suicide rates are projected to increase for all groups, 
and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis deaths are projected to increase for all 
groups except black men. A 2% per year reduction in projected accidental deaths 
would eliminate an estimated 178 700 deaths during 2017-30.
INTERPRETATION: To reduce future premature mortality, effective interventions 
are needed to address rapidly rising mortality rates due to accidents, suicides, 
and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Political, economic, and epidemiological changes in Brazil have 
affected health and the health system. We used the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2016 (GBD 2016) results to understand changing health patterns and inform 
policy responses.
METHODS: We analysed GBD 2016 estimates for life expectancy at birth (LE), 
healthy life expectancy (HALE), all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of 
life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), and risk factors for Brazil, its 26 states, and the Federal 
District from 1990 to 2016, and compared these with national estimates for ten 
comparator countries.
FINDINGS: Nationally, LE increased from 68·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 68·0-68·9) in 1990 to 75·2 years (74·7-75·7) in 2016, and HALE increased 
from 59·8 years (57·1-62·1) to 65·5 years (62·5-68·0). All-cause 
age-standardised mortality rates decreased by 34·0% (33·4-34·5), while all-cause 
age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 30·2% (27·7-32·8); the magnitude of 
declines varied among states. In 2016, ischaemic heart disease was the leading 
cause of age-standardised YLLs, followed by interpersonal violence. Low back and 
neck pain, sense organ diseases, and skin diseases were the main causes of YLDs 
in 1990 and 2016. Leading risk factors contributing to DALYs in 2016 were 
alcohol and drug use, high blood pressure, and high body-mass index.
INTERPRETATION: Health improved from 1990 to 2016, but improvements and disease 
burden varied between states. An epidemiological transition towards 
non-communicable diseases and related risks occurred nationally, but later in 
some states, while interpersonal violence grew as a health concern. Policy 
makers can use these results to address health disparities.

INTRODUCTION: Living with SCI remains a challenge and some patients fear or are 
faced with an inability to master this challenge sufficiently to regain a 
satisfactory quality of life. The suicide rate within the population with SCI is 
elevated compared with the general population. Especially now that life 
expectancy of persons with SCI and age at onset of SCI are increasing, 
caregivers of persons with SCI can be confronted with requests for end-of-life 
care or even assistance in dying. Euthanasia remains worldwide a controversial 
topic, but has rarely been discussed in the context of SCI.
CASE PRESENTATION: The medical history and the results of in-depth interviews 
with three persons with tetraplegia, between 36 and 88 years old, with a 
profound and repeated request for euthanasia testify of the importance of an 
open-minded dialogue concerning end-of-life questions, in which all options can 
be considered, and limits of patients' capacities and best care results are 
acknowledged.
CONCLUSION: These cases suggest that a well-regulated strictly controlled legal 
framework, handled with prudence and proficiency, can be an added value to the 
care for persons with SCI.

Angioedema (AE) classically manifests as an acute transient swelling of 
extra-visceral spaces, subcutaneous and submucosal tissues. Sometimes it may be 
a life-threatening condition. The causes are numerous, and the common 
denominator is an increased vascular permeability allowing diffusion or 
extravasation of fluid from the vascular bed to the interstitial space. The 
severity of AE is related to the cause, body location, and extension. We hereby 
report two very unusual cases characterized by a massive attack of AE from the 
left cervical area to the pelvis through the length of the mediastinum and axial 
posterior retroperitoneum. The diagnosis was established by CT. The first case 
was found related to drug intake, and the second appeared idiopathic.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Hepatitis C virus (cHCV) is a major health issue worldwide. 
New effective direct-acting anti-viral (DAA) drugs such as the combination 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, represent an important turning point, given the high 
sustained virologic response (SVR) rates associated with their use.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost and effects of two different treatment 
strategies based on sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Strategy 1: treating all patients, 
including those in the early stages of fibrosis; Strategy 2: reserving 
treatments for patients at more advanced stages of disease (≥ F3). The analysis 
compares the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Strategy 1 versus 
Strategy 2 in a cohort of HCV-infected patients and a cohort of hepatitis C 
virus (HCV)-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients.
METHODS: A Markov model simulating the natural history of the disease was built 
considering a 60-year time horizon and two cohorts of 1000 patients 
aged ≥ 35 years. Disease morbidity was classified according to the METAVIR 
classification. The robustness of the model was tested using deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).
RESULTS: In both cohorts, Strategy 1 results in higher resource consumption and 
a greater number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with Strategy 
2. The ICERs for the cohort of HCV patients and the cohort of co-infected 
HCV/HIV patients ranged between €15,555-74,804/QALY and €10,708-55,138/QALY, 
respectively, depending on the assumed cost of the treatment. In the PSA, the 
ICER distribution remained below the threshold of €30,000/QALY in 96 and 97% of 
the scenarios in the cohorts of HCV and HCV/HIV patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Extending the treatment of HCV to patients at an early stage of HCV 
infection is estimated to be cost effective from the perspective of the Italian 
Healthcare System.

BACKGROUND: Men with suspected prostate cancer usually undergo transrectal 
ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. TRUS-guided biopsy can cause side 
effects and has relatively poor diagnostic accuracy. Multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging (mpMRI) used as a triage test might allow men to avoid 
unnecessary TRUS-guided biopsy and improve diagnostic accuracy.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) assess the ability of mpMRI to identify men who can safely 
avoid unnecessary biopsy, (2) assess the ability of the mpMRI-based pathway to 
improve the rate of detection of clinically significant (CS) cancer compared 
with TRUS-guided biopsy and (3) estimate the cost-effectiveness of a mpMRI-based 
diagnostic pathway.
DESIGN: A validating paired-cohort study and an economic evaluation using a 
decision-analytic model.
SETTING: Eleven NHS hospitals in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Men at risk of prostate cancer undergoing a first prostate biopsy.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent three tests: (1) mpMRI (the index test), 
(2) TRUS-guided biopsy (the current standard) and (3) template prostate mapping 
(TPM) biopsy (the reference test).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI, TRUS-guided biopsy and 
TPM-biopsy measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) 
and negative predictive value (NPV) using primary and secondary definitions of 
CS cancer. The percentage of negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was 
used to identify men who might be able to avoid biopsy.
RESULTS: Diagnostic study - a total of 740 men were registered and 576 underwent 
all three tests. According to TPM-biopsy, the prevalence of any cancer was 71% 
[95% confidence interval (CI) 67% to 75%]. The prevalence of CS cancer according 
to the primary definition (a Gleason score of ≥ 4 + 3 and/or cancer core length 
of ≥ 6 mm) was 40% (95% CI 36% to 44%). For CS cancer, TRUS-guided biopsy showed 
a sensitivity of 48% (95% CI 42% to 55%), specificity of 96% (95% CI 94% to 
98%), PPV of 90% (95% CI 83% to 94%) and NPV of 74% (95% CI 69% to 78%). The 
sensitivity of mpMRI was 93% (95% CI 88% to 96%), specificity was 41% (95% CI 
36% to 46%), PPV was 51% (95% CI 46% to 56%) and NPV was 89% (95% CI 83% to 
94%). A negative mpMRI scan was recorded for 158 men (27%). Of these, 17 were 
found to have CS cancer on TPM-biopsy. Economic evaluation - the most 
cost-effective strategy involved testing all men with mpMRI, followed by 
MRI-guided TRUS-guided biopsy in those patients with suspected CS cancer, 
followed by rebiopsy if CS cancer was not detected. This strategy is 
cost-effective at the TRUS-guided biopsy definition 2 (any Gleason pattern of 
≥ 4 and/or cancer core length of ≥ 4 mm), mpMRI definition 2 (lesion volume of 
≥ 0.2 ml and/or Gleason score of ≥ 3 + 4) and cut-off point 2 (likely to be 
benign) and detects 95% (95% CI 92% to 98%) of CS cancers. The main drivers of 
cost-effectiveness were the unit costs of tests, the improvement in sensitivity 
of MRI-guided TRUS-guided biopsy compared with blind TRUS-guided biopsy and the 
longer-term costs and outcomes of men with cancer.
LIMITATIONS: The PROstate Magnetic resonance Imaging Study (PROMIS) was carried 
out in a selected group and excluded men with a prostate volume of > 100 ml, who 
are less likely to have cancer. The limitations in the economic modelling arise 
from the limited evidence on the long-term outcomes of men with prostate cancer 
and on the sensitivity of MRI-targeted repeat biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating mpMRI into the diagnostic pathway as an initial test 
prior to prostate biopsy may (1) reduce the proportion of men having unnecessary 
biopsies, (2) improve the detection of CS prostate cancer and (3) increase the 
cost-effectiveness of the prostate cancer diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. 
The PROMIS data set will be used for future research; this is likely to include 
modelling prognostic factors for CS cancer, optimising MRI scan sequencing and 
biomarker or translational research analyses using the blood and urine samples 
collected. Better-quality evidence on long-term outcomes in prostate cancer 
under the various management strategies is required to better assess 
cost-effectiveness. The value-of-information analysis should be developed 
further to assess new research to commission.

BACKGROUND: An association has recently been reported between frailty and 
reduced masticatory function; however, the causal relationship remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between 
masticatory function and frailty progression.
METHODS: Among 6699 individuals aged 65 and older (mean age 72.8 ± 5.2 years) 
who were invited to participate in comprehensive medical check-ups, 418 who 
underwent examinations at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology in 
both 2013 and 2015 and who met inclusion criteria were included in this study. 
Frailty was determined with the Kihon Checklist developed by the Japanese 
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The following three masticatory 
functions were evaluated: occlusal force, mixing ability and subjective chewing 
ability. The following confounding factors were investigated: age, sex, grip 
strength, comfortable walking speed, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, 
Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score, skeletal mass index (SMI), number of 
medications taken and number of remaining teeth. Statistical analysis was 
performed with binomial logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed that comfortable walking speed, 
SDS score, MMSE score and masticatory function were significantly related to 
progression to frailty or pre-frailty. Of the three masticatory function items 
evaluated, mixing ability and subjective chewing ability were related to frailty 
progression.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that masticatory function was associated with 
the progression to pre-frailty or frailty among community-dwelling individuals 
65 years and older over the 2-year period of this longitudinal study. Of the 
masticatory function items evaluated, mixing ability and subjective chewing 
ability were associated with frailty progression.

OBJECTIVE: To examine if, over a period of centuries, the Dutch medical 
establishment enjoyed a survival advantage over a population group with a 
comparable social background and level of education.
DESIGN: Retrospective database research.
METHOD: We used documents which provided data on the births and deaths of 15,649 
male and 659 female medical professionals and of 15,304 male clergy. We 
calculated the remaining life expectancy at the age of 25 of those generations 
born between the middle of the 16th century and the beginning of the 20th 
century. We applied event history analysis to estimate remaining life 
expectancy, dependently of survival at the age of 25. In doing this we applied 
Gompertz distribution and made a maximum likelihood estimation.
RESULTS: From the middle of the 16th century onwards, the development of the 
life expectancy of medical professionals and clergy was comparable; it was 
characterised by a continuing increase in remaining life expectancy which was 
only interrupted in those generations who were confronted with a series of 
epidemics. The level of the remaining life expectancy was also comparable. Only 
in the generation born in the first decade of the 20th century did the life 
expectancy of medical professionals become on par with that of the total male 
population. The remaining life expectancy of female medical professionals born 
from 1850 onwards was higher than that of the total female population.
CONCLUSION: For a long time, medical training conferred no advantage on 
survival.

Patients with cancer often do not have an accurate perception of their prognosis 
and the risks and side effects associated with potential treatments. Research 
has highlighted several reasons for these information gaps. Where more than one 
medically acceptable treatment is available, doctors may have a strong 
preference for a particular treatment option and steer the treatment decision by 
skewed information disclosure. Also, fear of the nocebo effect may prevent the 
provision of balanced information on side effects. Knowledge of prognosis is 
essential for making well-informed treatment decisions, but doctors may be 
reluctant to discuss limited life expectancy with their patients because they 
fear loss of hope and the deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship. 
Communication on these difficult subjects should be better integrated into 
medical training.

AIM: The aim of this study is to report a retrospective case series on orbital 
infantile haemangiomas (OIH). Radiological features and treatment with oral 
propranolol (OP) are illustrated along with an updated literature review.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of six children, diagnosed with OIH from 
November 2015 to October 2016, was carried out. Only children with deep 
documented orbital involvement were included. All patients underwent magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) under general anaesthesia. OP was administered to the 
infants according to the Nottingham Children's Hospital guideline. As per the 
guideline, a preliminary paediatric assessment was performed and a 1 mg/kg test 
dose was administered, followed by definitive treatment at a dosage of 2 mg/kg 
in three divided doses.
RESULTS: Average age at presentation was within the first 3 weeks of life. T1 
hypointensity, T2 hyperintensity, avid enhancement with contrast, and the 
presence of flow-voids appear a fixed pattern of OIH on MRI. Response to 
treatment was noticed within 4 weeks in all children, and two of them (33.3%) 
responded within the first 7 days. In two children (33.3%), the haemangioma 
became clinically undetectable by the seventh month of treatment, while the 
other four (66.6%) experienced an almost complete regression of the OIH by the 
last follow-up. No complications were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Our series strengthens the understanding that MRI is the preferred 
imaging modality in the investigation of OIH, showing vascular features, 
detailed orbital extension, and possible associated malformations. OP is the 
treatment of choice for OIH, and our study confirms its safety and 
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Evaluation of integrated care programmes for individuals with 
multi-morbidity requires a broader evaluation framework and a broader definition 
of added value than is common in cost-utility analysis. This is possible through 
the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This paper presents the seven steps of an MCDA to evaluate 
17 different integrated care programmes for individuals with multi-morbidity in 
8 European countries participating in the 4-year, EU-funded SELFIE project. In 
step one, qualitative research was undertaken to better understand the 
decision-context of these programmes. The programmes faced decisions related to 
their sustainability in terms of reimbursement, continuation, extension, and/or 
wider implementation. In step two, a uniform set of decision criteria was 
defined in terms of outcomes measured across the 17 programmes: physical 
functioning, psychological well-being, social relationships and participation, 
enjoyment of life, resilience, person-centeredness, continuity of care, and 
total health and social care costs. These were supplemented by programme-type 
specific outcomes. Step three presents the quasi-experimental studies designed 
to measure the performance of the programmes on the decision criteria. Step four 
gives details of the methods (Discrete Choice Experiment, Swing Weighting) to 
determine the relative importance of the decision criteria among five 
stakeholder groups per country. An example in step five illustrates the 
value-based method of MCDA by which the performance of the programmes on each 
decision criterion is combined with the weight of the respective criterion to 
derive an overall value score. Step six describes how we deal with uncertainty 
and introduces the Conditional Multi-Attribute Acceptability Curve. Step seven 
addresses the interpretation of results in stakeholder workshops.
DISCUSSION: By discussing our solutions to the challenges involved in creating a 
uniform MCDA approach for the evaluation of different programmes, this paper 
provides guidance to future evaluations and stimulates debate on how to evaluate 
integrated care for multi-morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Work ability (WA) is an indication of how well someone's health, 
skills and experience match current job demands. The aim of this study was to 
ascertain whether the work ability model can provide a useful explanatory 
framework to understand some elements of sustainable employability (SE) amongst 
GPs.
METHODS: A thematic analysis of 19 in-depth interviews with GPs in the Northern 
Rivers region of NSW, Australia, was conducted and formed the basis for a 
qualitative validation of the work ability model.
RESULTS: In order to provide a more comprehensive reflection on the factors and 
dynamics found to underpin work ability amongst ageing GPs required the creation 
of specific subcategories within the WA model. Additionally, new themes relevant 
to general practice also emerged from the data. The analyses revealed a set of 
important, new factors and relationships that required additions and refinements 
to the original model, in order to fully explain sustainable employability in 
this GP sample. These new emerging themes that required model extension were 
'Work-life balance and lifestyle', 'Extended social community' and 'Impact of 
gender'.
CONCLUSION: While the WA model provides a basic explanatory framework for 
understanding some elements of sustainable employability amongst GPs, a revision 
of the current model has been proposed to sufficiently describe the factors 
impinging on sustainable employability in this group. The extended model can 
potentially be used for addressing workforce planning issues and to assist in 
programme design to promote sustainable employability amongst GPs and could 
potentially be translated to other health professional groups.

Major progress in preventing, delaying or curing various pathologies normally 
encountered in old age results in a continuous improvement in life expectancy. 
However, understanding the underlying cause of the disparate comorbidities 
occurrence with aging remains a priority in order to propose adapted care for 
the older population. In one hand, aging profoundly impairs the immune system; 
it is characterized by many changes in haematopoiesis, adaptive and innate 
systems, and is associated with pro-inflammatory environment. In another hand, 
stressful events (acute or chronic) can also impact the immune system through 
the secretion of hormones, which are also altered with aging. Blooming evidences 
from psychoneuroimmunology field suggest that, in acute medical conditions, 
elderly people are not equal in their responses to stressors depending on many 
extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. These factors could interfere with elderly's 
ability to mount an effective immune response. The objective of this review is 
to provide an overview of the literature (from fundamental to clinical 
observations) to draw a global picture of immunosenescence. Understanding this 
process could enable us to target fundamental age-related pathways and thus open 
new avenues in improving both lifespan and health span.
