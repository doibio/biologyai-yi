gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, screening for AAA in individuals with IA is 
cost-effective at an ICER of $1150/QALY, well below accepted societal thresholds 
estimated at $60,000/QALY. Cost-effectiveness of cross-screening in these 
populations is sensitive to aneurysm coprevalence and risk of rupture. Further 
prospective study is warranted to validate this finding.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors suffer from long-term adverse effects that reduce 
health-related quality of life (QOL) and physical functioning, creating an 
urgent need to develop effective, durable, and disseminable interventions. 
Harvest for Health, a home-based vegetable gardening intervention, holds promise 
for these domains.
METHODS: This report describes the methods and recruitment experiences from two 
randomized controlled feasibility trials that employ a waitlist-controlled 
design. Delivered in partnership with Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners, 
this intervention provides one-on-one mentorship of cancer survivors in planning 
and maintaining three seasonal vegetable gardens over 12months. The primary aim 
is to determine intervention feasibility and acceptability; secondary aims are 
to explore effects on objective and subjective measures of diet, physical 
activity and function, and QOL and examine participant factors associated with 
potential effects. One trial is conducted exclusively among 82 female breast 
cancer survivors residing in the Birmingham, AL metropolitan area (BBCS); 
another broadly throughout Alabama among 46 older cancer survivors aged >60 
(ASCS).
RESULTS: Response rates were 32.6% (BBCS) and 52.3% (ASCS). Both trials exceeded 
80% of their accrual target. Leading reasons for ineligibility were removal of 
>10 lymph nodes (lymphedema risk factor), lack of physician approval, and 
unwillingness to be randomized to the waitlist.
CONCLUSION: To date, recruitment and implementation of Harvest for Health 
appears feasible.
DISCUSSION: Although both studies encountered recruitment challenges, lessons 
learned can inform future larger-scale studies. Vegetable gardening 
interventions are of interest to cancer survivors and may provide opportunities 
to gain life skills leading to improvements in overall health and QOL.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In developed countries persons who inject drugs (PWID) 
represents a significant risk for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is 
reported that up to half of persons with chronic HCV remain undiagnosed and 
reliance on attendance to specialist clinics remain a barrier to treatment. This 
study assesses the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of outreach screening and 
treatment within a Drug Treatment Unit (DTU).
METHODS: All persons attending a London DTU were offered HCV testing, and where 
appropriate follow-up and treatment by a specialist nurse at the DTU. Three 
years of data informed a cost-effective-analysis using a validated Markov model. 
A hypothetical scenario in which only direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatments 
were used was also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 321 persons eligible, 216 were screened, 89 were HCV positive and 66 
had confirmatory evidence of viraemia. All were infected with either HCV 
genotype 1 or 3. Treatment was initiated in 29 persons, 22 with interferon based 
and 7 DAA only regimens. Following initial treatment 21 (72%) achieved SVR12. It 
is estimated that this programme represents an average per-patient cost-saving 
of £2498 and a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 4.10 over a lifetime. 
In a hypothetical scenario of all oral DAA treatment, an incremental cost per 
QALY of £1029 was estimated.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates feasibility and cost effectiveness of 
outreach testing and treatment of hepatitis C within comparable DTU settings. 
Additional costs of newer DAA therapies would not be prohibitive when 
considering willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly used by policy makers.

OBJECTIVES: We present the global burden of bipolar disorder based on findings 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013).
METHODS: Data on the epidemiology of bipolar disorder were obtained from a 
systematic literature review and assembled using Bayesian meta-regression 
modelling to produce prevalence by country, age, sex and year. Years lived with 
disability (YLDs) were estimated by multiplying prevalence by disability weights 
quantifying the severity of the health loss associated with bipolar disorder. As 
there were no years of life lost (YLLs) attributed to bipolar disorder, YLDs 
equated to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as a measure of total burden.
RESULTS: There were 32.7 million cases of bipolar disorder globally in 1990 and 
48.8 million in 2013; equivalent to a 49.1% increase in prevalent cases, all 
accounted for by population increase and ageing. Bipolar disorder accounted for 
9.9 million DALYs in 2013, explaining 0.4% of total DALYs and 1.3% of total 
YLDs. There were 5.5 million DALYs recorded for female individuals and 4.4 
million for male individuals. DALYs were evident from age 10 years, peaked in 
the 20s, and decreased thereafter. DALYs were relatively constant 
geographically.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite being relatively rare, bipolar disorder is a disabling 
illness due to its early onset, severity and chronicity. Population growth and 
aging are leading to an increase in the burden of bipolar disorder over time. It 
is important that resources be directed towards improving the coverage of 
evidence-based intervention strategies for bipolar disorder and establishing 
strategies to prevent new cases of the disorder.

INTRODUCTION: Over recent years, there has been concerted effort to 'close the 
gap' in the disproportionately reduced life expectancy and increased morbidity 
experienced by indigenous compared to non-indigenous persons. Specific to 
musculoskeletal health, some data suggest that indigenous peoples have a higher 
risk of sustaining a fracture compared to non-indigenous peoples. This creates 
an imperative to identify factors that could explain differences in fracture 
rates. This protocol presents our aim to conduct a systematic review, first, to 
determine whether differences in fracture rates exist for indigenous versus 
non-indigenous persons and, second, to identify any risk factors that might 
explain these differences.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic search of PubMed, OVID, 
MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE to identify articles that compare all-cause fracture 
rates at any skeletal site between indigenous and non-indigenous persons of any 
age. Eligibility of studies will be determined by 2 independent reviewers. 
Studies will be assessed for methodological quality using a previously published 
process. We will conduct a meta-analysis and use established statistical methods 
to identify and control for heterogeneity where appropriate. Should 
heterogeneity prevents numerical syntheses, we will undertake a best-evidence 
analysis to determine the level of evidence for differences in fracture between 
indigenous and non-indigenous persons.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review will use published data; thus, 
ethical permissions are not required. In addition to peer-reviewed publication, 
findings will be presented at (inter)national conferences, disseminated 
electronically and in print, and will be made available to key country-specific 
decision-makers with authority for indigenous health.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention 
for primary care patients with raised cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
DESIGN: A prospective within-trial patient-level economic evaluation conducted 
alongside a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Patients recruited through primary care, and intervention delivered via 
telehealth service.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a 10-year CVD risk ≥20%, as measured by the QRISK2 
algorithm, with at least 1 modifiable risk factor.
INTERVENTION: A series of up to 13 scripted, theory-led telehealth encounters 
with healthcare advisors, who supported participants to make behaviour change, 
use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. Participants in 
the control arm received usual care.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness measured by net 
monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from 
incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Productivity impacts, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical 
outcome were presented in a cost-consequences framework.
RESULTS: 641 participants were randomised-325 to receive the telehealth 
intervention in addition to usual care and 316 to receive only usual care. 18% 
of participants had missing data on either costs, utilities or both. Multiple 
imputation was used for the base case results. The intervention was associated 
with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service (NHS) costs of £138 
(95% CI 66 to 211) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.012 (95% CI -0.001 to 
0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £10 859. Net monetary 
benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY was £116 (95% CI 
-58 to 291), and the probability that the intervention was cost-effective at 
this threshold value was 0.77. Similar results were obtained from a complete 
case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that the Healthlines telehealth 
intervention was likely to be cost-effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Janssen, 
the company manufacturing abiraterone acetate (AA; tradename Zytiga®), to submit 
evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of AA in combination with 
prednisone/prednisolone (AAP) compared with watchful waiting (i.e. best 
supportive care [BSC]) for chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 
(KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was 
commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary 
of the company submission (CS), the ERG report, subsequent addenda, and the 
development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales 
by the Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the 
clinical and cost effectiveness of AAP based on the CS. An important question in 
this appraisal was, according to the ERG, whether AAP followed by docetaxel is 
more effective than BSC followed by docetaxel. In the COU-AA-302 trial, 239 of 
546 (43.8 %) AAP patients and 304 of 542 (56.1 %) BSC patients received 
docetaxel as subsequent therapy, following AA or placebo. The results for this 
specific group of patients were not presented in the CS; therefore, the ERG 
asked the company to provide these data in the clarification letter; however, 
these data were presented as commercial-in-confidence and cannot therefore be 
reported here. The ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic 
evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (a) not using the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population; (b) inconsistencies in estimating 
prediction equations; (c) not fully incorporating the impact of adverse events; 
(d) incorrectly incorporating the new patient access scheme (PAS); and (e) the 
assumption that AA non-compliance leads to recoverable drug costs. Although some 
of these issues were adjusted in the ERG base case, the ERG could not estimate 
the impact of all of these issues, and thus acknowledges that there are still 
uncertainties concerning the cost-effectiveness evidence. With the exception of 
the ERG's preference for using the ITT population, the AC agreed with the 
approach taken in the ERG base case. The original company and ERG base-case 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were £46,722 and £57,688 per QALY 
gained, respectively; these changed to £28,563 and £38,061 per QALY gained, 
respectively, in the revised base cases applying a new PAS. Regarding the 
end-of-life criteria, after 24 months approximately 63 % of patients in the 
control group of the COU-AA-302 trial were still alive, and the median survival 
was 30.1 months (95 % CI 27.3-34.1). Therefore, it is unlikely that life 
expectancy would be less than 24 months. The AC stated that the most plausible 
ICER is likely between £28,600 and £32,800 per QALY gained, and concluded that 
AAP at this stage in the treatment pathway did not meet the end-of-life 
criterion for short life expectancy. Moreover, in March 2016, the AC produced 
the final guidance, stating that AAP is recommended, within its marketing 
authorisation, as an option for treating mCRPC.

AIM: To study the views on the acceptability of terminal sedation (TS) of 
laypeople and health professionals in France.
METHOD: In November 2013-June 2015, 223 laypeople and 53 health professionals 
(21 physicians and 32) judged the acceptability of TS in 48 realistic scenarios 
composed of all combinations of four factors: (a) the patients' life expectancy, 
(b) their request for sedation, (c) the decision-making process and (d) the type 
of sedation. In all scenarios, the patients were women with a terminal illness 
suffering from intractable pain and receiving the best possible care. The 
ratings were subjected to cluster analysis and analyses of variance.
RESULTS: Five qualitatively different positions were found that were termed TS 
acceptable if decision taken collectively (15%), TS acceptable if patient 
explicitly requested it (19%), TS acceptable if patient did not explicitly 
oppose it (47%), 24-hour sedation not acceptable (6%) and TS always acceptable 
(13%). The percentage of older participants in the 'always acceptable' cluster 
was higher than the percentage of younger participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Laypeople and health professionals do not appear to be 
systematically opposed to TS. The most important factors in increasing its 
acceptability were the patients' request for sedation and the collective 
character of the decision-making process.

This study investigated the accumulation Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn in 
Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) early life stages (egg, embryo and 
larvae) and compared the concentrations to the concentration of each element in 
sediment, pore water and overlying water for 5 sites across Long Island, NY. For 
the majority of the sites, all essential trace elements accumulated in the 
embryos and larvae. However, many of the embryos and larvae at specific sites 
presented different concentration patterns which had no apparent relationship 
with the local habitat sediment and water values. Generally, Cu, Fe, and Se 
sequentially increased from egg stage through larval stages for the majority of 
sites, while Co, Mn, and Ni only did for a few sites. Zinc also showed an 
increase across sites from embryo to larval stage, however was the only one to 
show a decrease in concentration from egg to embryo stage at all sites. 
Interestingly, Mn at Manhasset Bay presented embryo and larval stages to be 50 
fold greater than all other sites while the egg stage showed similar values to 
other sites; this high degree of uptake could be due to a high concentration in 
the overlying water. All essential trace elements can be accumulated from the 
environment but greater concentrations may be influenced by abiotic factors and 
the predominant uptake route (aqueous versus diet) at each life stage. Future 
laboratory experiments are required to investigate factors that influence 
essential trace element accumulation and loss in horseshoe crab early life 
stages.

PURPOSE: To assess the correlation between functional MRI, including ADC values 
obtained from DWI and DCE, and clinical outcome in patients with bone metastases 
treated with MRgFUS.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-three patients with symptomatic bone metastases 
underwent MRgFUS treatment (ExAblate 2100 system InSightec) for pain palliation. 
All patients underwent clinical and imaging follow-up examinations at 1, 3 and 
6 months after treatment. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate 
treatment efficacy in terms of pain palliation while ADC maps obtained by DWI 
sequences, and DCE data were used for quantitative assessment of treatment 
response at imaging. Spearman Correlation Coefficient Test was calculated to 
assess the correlation between VAS, ADC and DCE data.
RESULTS: All treatments were performed successfully without adverse events. On 
the basis of VAS score, 16 (69.6 %) patients were classified as complete 
clinical responders, 6 (26.1 %) as partial responders and only one (4.3 %) was 
classified as a non-responder. The mean VAS score decreased from 7.09 ± 1.8 at 
baseline to 2.65 ± 1.36 at 1 month, 1.04 ± 1.91 at 3 months and 1.09 ± 1.99 at 
6 months (p < 0.001). Baseline mean ADC value of treated lesions was 
1.05 ± 0.15 mm2/s, increasing along follow-up period (1.57 ± 0.27 mm2/s 1st 
month; 1.49 ± 0.3 mm2/s 3rd month; 1.45 ± 0.32 mm2/s 6th month, p < 0.001). Non 
perfused volume (NPV) was 46.4 at 1 month, 45.2 at 3 months and 43.8 at 
6 months. Spearman Coefficient demonstrated a statistically significant negative 
correlation between VAS and ADC values (ρ = -0.684; p = 0.03), but no 
significant correlation between VAS and NPV (ρ = 0.02216, p = 0.9305). Among 
other DCE data, Ktrans significantly changed in complete responders (3 months 
Ktrans = 2.14/min; -ΔKt = 52.65 % p < 0.01) and was not significantly different 
in partial responders (3 months Ktrans 0.042/min; ΔKt = 11.39 % p > 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In patients with painful bone metastases treated with MRgFUS, ADC 
and Ktrans variation observed in the ablated lesions correlate with VAS values 
and may play a role as objective imaging marker of treatment response.

Comment in
    Lancet Glob Health. 2016 Oct;4(10):e666-7.

BACKGROUND: The eastern Mediterranean region is comprised of 22 countries: 
Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, 
Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, 
Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of 
revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study 
was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern 
Mediterranean region as of 2013.
METHODS: GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 
to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk 
factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated 
systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from 
collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several 
improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 
2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean 
region specifically.
FINDINGS: The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart 
disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17·2% since 1990. 
However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186·7 
deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26·9% since 1990. The 
leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart 
disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood 
pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 
83·3% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income 
countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, 
Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. 
Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and 
middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with 
child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days 
to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected older 
people (aged 60-80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass 
index increased from 3·7% to 7·5% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health 
problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from 
non-communicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, 
Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life 
expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for 
females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going 
through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, 
coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the 
region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in 
life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the 
current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries 
and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the 
world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the 
region in addition to reducing the conflicts.

BACKGROUND: Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is common in daily practice. An 
empirical, widely accepted and applicable measure to quantify TRD is lacking. 
Previously, the Maudsley Staging Method (MSM) showed good validity. We aimed to 
improve the MSM by refining and extending its items resulting in the Dutch 
Measure for quantification of TRD (DM-TRD).
METHODS: In addition to duration, severity and failed treatments in the current 
depressive episode, we added items for functional impairment, comorbid anxiety, 
personality disorders and psychosocial stressors. We extended the augmentation 
section and added items for failed psychotherapy and intensified treatment. We 
examined psychometric properties of the DM-TRD and tested prediction of future 
depressive symptoms and remission after 16 weeks in 274 (DSM-IV) depressed in- 
and outpatients entering naturalistic treatment.
RESULTS: The DM-TRD showed excellent inter-/intra-rater reliability. Higher 
scores were associated with more symptoms and less remission during follow-up. 
The DM-TRD outperformed the MSM in prediction of future depressive 
symptomatology. Remission was predicted equally well by both measures. Longer 
duration of the current episode, larger functional impairment and larger 
baseline symptom severity were the strongest predictors of symptomatology at 
follow-up. Longer duration and larger functional impairment were negatively 
associated with remission.
LIMITATIONS: Longer follow-up could have increased predictive power. Addition of 
items for somatic co-morbidity, childhood adversity and psychotic features must 
be investigated further.
CONCLUSION: The DM-TRD has excellent psychometric properties and better 
predictive validity for clinical outcome than other sophisticated measure 
published to date. Its use in clinical practice and research will improve 
treatment planning in TRD-patients.

OBJECTIVE: To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association 
of Urology (EAU) - European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) - 
International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on screening, 
diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent of clinically localised 
prostate cancer (PCa).
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The working panel performed a literature review of the new 
data (2013-2015). The guidelines were updated and the levels of evidence and/or 
grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the 
evidence.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: BRCA2 mutations have been added as risk factors for early 
and aggressive disease. In addition to the Gleason score, the five-tier 2014 
International Society of Urological Pathology grading system should now be 
provided. Systematic screening is still not recommended. Instead, an individual 
risk-adapted strategy following a detailed discussion and taking into account 
the patient's wishes and life expectancy must be considered. An early 
prostate-specific antigen test, the use of a risk calculator, or one of the 
promising biomarker tools are being investigated and might be able to limit the 
overdetection of insignificant PCa. Breaking the link between diagnosis and 
treatment may lower the overtreatment risk. Multiparametric magnetic resonance 
imaging using standardised reporting cannot replace systematic biopsy, but 
robustly nested within the diagnostic work-up, it has a key role in local 
staging. Active surveillance always needs to be discussed with very low-risk 
patients. The place of surgery in high-risk disease and the role of lymph node 
dissection have been clarified, as well as the management of node-positive 
patients. Radiation therapy using dose-escalated intensity-modulated technology 
is a key treatment modality with recent improvement in the outcome based on
