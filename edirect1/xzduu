Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) has a favorable prognosis and normal life 
expectancy. However, many patients suffer from mast cell (MC) mediator-related 
symptoms, which significantly affect quality of life (QoL). Cutaneous, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological complaints, musculoskeletal pain, and the 
presence of skin lesions, anaphylaxis, and osteoporosis are the main symptoms 
and signs in ISM and must be assessed in all patients before and during 
treatment. Validated mastocytosis-specific patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) should be used for this purpose. Serum tryptase and KIT D816V allele 
burden are recommended as secondary outcome parameters, noting that they do not 
reflect the severity of signs, symptoms, and related QoL impairment, but 
indirectly express MC burden. Changes from baseline of 90%, 60%, and 30% 
indicate complete response >90%, major response 60% to 90%, partial response 30% 
to 60%, and no response <30% to treatment. To conclude, we recommend the use of 
PROMs as primary outcome parameters to define treatment response in patients 
with ISM in clinical trials and in everyday clinical practice.

Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with 
end-stage kidney disease. Unlike adult recipients undergoing transplantation, 
special considerations must be taken when transplanting children based on the 
underlying etiology of kidney disease, previous surgical procedures, anatomical 
limitations and necessary technical adjustments. Additionally, the choice of 
donor must be measured to ensure optimal graft survival given a longer 
post-transplant life expectancy. Those topics as well as frequently encountered 
postoperative complications are also discussed in this publication.

BACKGROUND: To understand the magnitude and spatial-temporal distribution of the 
regional burden attributable to severe mental disorders is of great essential 
and high policy relevance. The study aimed to address the burden of severe 
mental disorders by evaluating the years of life lost, years lived with 
disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in Guangdong, China.
METHODS: We undertook a longitudinal study based on a multicenter database 
established by the Health Commission of Guangdong, involving a total of 21 
prefectures and four economic regions in the Guangdong province. A total of 
520,731 medical records from patients with severe mental disorders were 
collected for 2010-2020. Data were analyzed via an integrated evaluation 
framework by synthesizing prevalence estimates, epidemiological adjustment as 
well as comorbidity assessment to develop internally consistent estimates of 
DALY. DALY changes during 2010-2020 were decomposed by population growth and 
aging and further grouped by Socio-demographic Index (SDI). DALYs were projected 
to 2030 by the weighted median annualized rate of change in 2010-2020.
RESULTS: In 2010-2020, the average DALYs for severe mental disorders reached 
798,474 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 536,280-1,270,465) person-years (52.2% 
for males, and 47.8% for females). Severe mental disorders led to a great amount 
of disease burden, especially in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan cities. 
Schizophrenia and mental retardation with mental disorders were the two leading 
sources of the burden ascribed to severe mental disorders. Population growth and 
aging could be accountable for the increasing burden of severe mental disorders. 
Economic regions with higher SDI carried a greater burden but had lower 
annualized rates of change in DALYs. The overall burden of severe mental 
disorders is projected to rise modestly over the next decade.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings urge prioritization of initiatives focused on public 
mental health, prevention strategies, health resources reallocation, and active 
involvement of authorities to effectively address the anticipated needs.

The exact path leading to cognitive impairment that goes beyond malaria is 
unclear, but it appears to be the result of interactive factors. Time of 
exposure to disease and recurrences are potentially major determinant variables. 
Cognitive impairment is described mainly in children, rarely in adults. The 
disease in high endemic areas usually does not affect elderlies, because of 
acquired immunity over time. However, this population is relatively more 
frequently sick in lower endemic areas, such as in the Amazon. This study 
assessed the effect of Plasmodium vivax malaria on the executive and cognitive 
functions of elderlies, in the Brazilian Amazon. A cohort study was conducted to 
evaluate executive and cognitive functions one week (T0), two months (T2) and 
eight months (T8) after the malaria episode. Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), 
Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS-III), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 
(WCST) were used to assess executive and cognitive functions. One hundred-forty 
elderlies were enrolled (70 with P. vivax malaria and 70 without malaria). P. 
vivax malaria was associated with impairment of the executive and cognitive 
functions in elderlies for up to 8 months after acute P. vivax malaria. Prior 
history of malaria, recurrences and higher parasitemia were independently 
associated with various surrogates of executive and cognitive impairment. With 
the increase in life expectancy, elderlies living in malaria endemic areas will 
deserve more attention from health authorities, to guarantee improvement of 
their quality of life in the tropics.

Hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases. Lifestyle 
modification is a significant component of nonpharmacological treatments for 
hypertension. We previously reported the clinical efficacy of digital 
therapeutics (DTx) in the HERB-DH1 trial. However, there is still a lack of 
cost-effectiveness assessments evaluating the impact of prescription DTx. This 
study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of using prescription DTx in 
treating hypertension. We developed a monthly cycle Markov model and conducted 
Monte Carlo simulations using the HERB-DH1 trial data to investigate 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the cost of DTx for hypertension plus 
guideline-based lifestyle modification consultation treatment as usual (TAU), 
comparing DTx + TAU and TAU-only groups with a lifetime horizon. The model 
inputs were obtained from the HERB-DH1 trial, published or publicly available 
data, and expert assumptions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
per QALY was used as the benchmark for cost-effectiveness. We performed 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) using the Monte Carlo simulation with 
two million sets. The DTx + TAU strategy produced 18.778 QALYs and was 
associated with ¥3,924,075 ($34,122) expected costs, compared with 18.686 QALYs 
and ¥3,813,358 ($33,160) generated by the TAU-only strategy over a lifetime 
horizon, resulting in an ICER of ¥1,199,880 ($10,434)/QALY gained for DTx + TAU. 
The monthly cost and attrition rate of DTx for hypertension have a significant 
impact on ICERs. In the PSA, the probability of the DTx arm being a 
cost-effective option was 87.8% at a threshold value of ¥5 million 
($43,478)/QALY gained. In conclusion, the DTx + TAU strategy was more 
cost-effective than the TAU-only strategy.

BACKGROUND: Post heart-transplant survival has increased, but information is 
lacking on specific causes of death and life expectancy. We aimed to assess 
cause-specific loss of life-years compared to the general population, evaluate 
classification for cause of death after heart transplantation, and assess 
validity of cause of death data from the International Society of Heart and Lung 
Transplant (ISHLT) registry.
METHODS: In this single center study, we included 239 heart recipients 
transplanted between 1988 and 2019 in Lund, Sweden (n = 239, 50% of the 
transplanted population where the cause of death was available). Two 
cardiologists retrospectively assigned causes of death according to a published 
classification (CLASS) in the 91 recipients who died during follow-up. Life 
expectancy was compared to data from the general population.
RESULTS: Compared to the average Swedish population, life expectancy for heart 
transplant recipients was 20 years shorter (IQR 12.9-27.2). The largest number 
of life-years lost were for deaths due to acute (49 years) and chronic rejection 
(27 years). Primary graft dysfunction (24 years) accounted for 24% of deaths, 
followed by malignancy (20 years) and infection (17 years), each accounting for 
∼20% of deaths. Use of CLASS revealed moderate inter-rater agreement (56%) and 
moderate agreement with the ISHLT registry (62%).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival after heart transplantation was 20 years lower than in the 
general population. In the young, more life-years were lost due to acute graft 
rejection, whereas chronic graft rejection and primary graft failure were more 
important causes of death in older patients. Agreement was moderate between 
CLASS and the ISHLT registry classifications.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and 
the most common form of dementia, especially in the elderly. Due to the increase 
in life expectancy, in recent years, there has been an excessive growth in the 
number of people affected by this disease, causing serious problems for health 
systems. In recent years, research has been intensified to find new therapeutic 
approaches that prevent the progression of the disease. In this sense, recent 
studies indicate that the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated 
kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene, which is located on chromosome 21q22.2 and 
overexpressed in Down syndrome (DS), may play a significant role in 
developmental brain disorders and early onset neurodegeneration, neuronal loss 
and dementia in DS and AD. Inhibiting DYRK1A may serve to stop the phenotypic 
effects of its overexpression and, therefore, is a potential treatment strategy 
for the prevention of ageassociated neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer-type 
pathology.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we investigate the contribution of DYRK1A inhibitors 
as potential anti-AD agents.
METHODS: A search in the literature to compile an in vitro dataset including 
IC50 values involving DYRK1A was performed from 2014 to the present day. In 
addition, we carried out structure-activity relationship studies based on in 
vitro and in silico data.
RESULTS: molecular modeling and enzyme kinetics studies indicate that DYRK1A may 
contribute to AD pathology through its proteolytic process, reducing its kinase 
specificity.
CONCLUSION: further evaluation of DYRK1A inhibitors may contribute to new 
therapeutic approaches for AD.

BACKGROUND: In the CABANA trial (Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug 
Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation), catheter ablation did not significantly reduce 
the primary end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac 
arrest compared with drug therapy by intention-to-treat, but did improve the 
quality of life and freedom from atrial fibrillation recurrence. In the heart 
failure subgroup, ablation improved both survival and quality of life. 
Cost-effectiveness was a prespecified CABANA secondary end point.
METHODS: Medical resource use data were collected for all CABANA patients 
(N=2204). Costs for hospital-based care were assigned using prospectively 
collected bills from US patients (n=1171); physician and medication costs were 
assigned using the Medicare Fee Schedule and National Average Drug Acquisition 
Costs, respectively. Extrapolated life expectancies were estimated using 
age-based survival models. Quality-of-life adjustments were based on EQ-5D-based 
utilities measured during the trial. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing ablation with drug therapy on the basis of 
intention-to-treat, and assessed from the US health care sector perspective.
RESULTS: Costs in the first 3 months averaged $20 794±SD 1069 higher with 
ablation compared with drug therapy. The cumulative within-trial 5-year cost 
difference was $19 245 (95% CI, $11 360-$27 170) and the lifetime mean cost 
difference was $15 516 (95% CI, -$2963 to $35,512) higher with ablation than 
with drug therapy. The drug therapy arm accrued an average of 12.5 life-years 
(LYs) and 10.7 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). For the ablation arm, the 
corresponding estimates were 12.6 LYs and 11.0 QALYs. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $57 893 per QALY gained, with 75% of bootstrap 
replications yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$100 000 per QALY 
gained. With no quality-of-life/utility adjustments, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $183 318 per LY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation was economically 
attractive compared with drug therapy in the CABANA Trial overall at present 
benchmarks for health care value in the United States on the basis of projected 
incremental QALYs but not LYs alone.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the annual burden of cardiovascular 
diseases and depression attributable to five psychosocial work exposures in 28 
European Union countries (EU28) in 2015.
METHODS: Based on available attributable fraction estimates, the study covered 
five exposures, job strain, effort-reward imbalance, job insecurity, long 
working hours and workplace bullying; and five outcomes, coronary/ischemic heart 
diseases (CHD), stroke, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease and 
depression. We estimated the burden attributable to each exposure separately and 
all exposures together. We calculated Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) rate 
per 100 000 workers in each country for each outcome attributable to each 
exposure and tested the differences between countries and between genders using 
the Wald test.
RESULTS: The overall burden of CHD attributable to the five studied psychosocial 
work exposures together was estimated at 173 629 DALYs for men and 39 238 for 
women, 5092 deaths for men and 1098 for women in EU28 in 2015. The overall 
burden of depression was estimated at 528 549 DALYs for men and 344 151 for 
women (respectively 7862 and 1823 deaths). The three highest burdens in DALYs in 
EU28 in 2015 were found for depression attributable to job strain (546 502 
DALYs), job insecurity (294 680 DALYs) and workplace bullying (276 337 DALYs). 
Significant differences between countries were observed for DALY rates per 100 
000 workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Such results are necessary as decision tools for decision-makers 
(governments, employers and trade unions) when defining public health priorities 
and work stress preventive strategies in Europe.

Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth secreted by skeletal 
myocytes. In the past years, myostatin inhibition sparked interest among the 
scientific community for its potential to enhance muscle growth and to reduce, 
or even prevent, muscle atrophy. These characteristics make it a promising 
target for the treatment of muscle atrophy in motor neuron diseases, namely, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which are 
rare neurological diseases, whereby the degeneration of motor neurons leads to 
progressive muscle loss and paralysis. These diseases carry a huge burden of 
morbidity and mortality but, despite this unfavorable scenario, several 
therapeutic advancements have been made in the past years. Indeed, a number of 
different curative therapies for SMA have been approved, leading to a revolution 
in the life expectancy and outcomes of SMA patients. Similarly, tofersen, an 
antisense oligonucleotide, is now undergoing clinical trial phase for use in ALS 
patients carrying the SOD1 mutation. However, these therapies are not able to 
completely halt or reverse progression of muscle damage. Recently, a trial 
evaluating apitegromab, a myostatin inhibitor, in SMA patients was started, 
following positive results from preclinical studies. In this context, myostatin 
inhibition could represent a useful strategy to tackle motor symptoms in these 
patients. The aim of this review is to describe the myostatin pathway and its 
role in motor neuron diseases, and to summarize and critically discuss 
preclinical and clinical studies of myostatin inhibitors in SMA and ALS. Then, 
we will highlight promises and pitfalls related to the use of myostatin 
inhibitors in the human setting, to aid the scientific community in the 
development of future clinical trials.

Overlap extension PCR is one of the routinely used methods to generate mutagenic 
genes for the functional and structural study of proteins. However, it is 
time-consuming to design the overlapping mutagenic primers and gene primers by 
manual operation. In this chapter, we present a Python script that is able to 
search all the possible primer combinations according to the preset definitions 
and calculate the necessary parameters of each primer for the users, which could 
facilitate the primer design process. Up to 256 pairs of primers can be provided 
for selection using this script.

The linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis is still the ruling concept which 
dictates the radiation protection health policy and regulations. However, more 
and more studies show that not only that low dose radiation pose no danger to 
our health, but also exhibits clear beneficial health effects. Here, we 
evaluated the correlative links of the natural sources of radiation-terrestrial 
radiation (TR), cosmic radiation (CR), and Radon-222, with life expectancy, the 
most integrative index of population health. The results of this study show that 
the different sources of natural radiation display positive correlative links to 
life expectancy, which is in line with the hypothesis of radiation hormesis.

INTRODUCTION: Despite currently available treatments for adults with 
relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL), survival outcomes 
remain poor, highlighting the need for new therapeutic strategies. This study 
estimates the cost-effectiveness of KTE-X19 to treat adults with R/R ALL from a 
US payer perspective.
METHODS: The model had two components: a decision-tree, where pre-infusion costs 
for patients who ultimately did not receive KTE-X19 are accounted for, followed 
by a partitioned survival analysis, where all KTE-X19 infused patients would 
enter the three-state (pre-progression, progressed disease, death) model. 
Comparators included current standard of care treatments, i.e., blinatumomab 
(BLIN), inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO), and salvage chemotherapy (CHEMO). Both 
standard parametric and mixture cure models were used to model survival. 
Efficacy, safety, healthcare resource utilization, and health state utility 
inputs were derived from the ZUMA-3 trial (NCT02614066) and literature. Cost 
inputs were derived from literature or publicly available sources. Outcomes and 
costs were discounted 3% annually. Results of KTE-X19 versus comparators are 
reported as total and incremental life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), costs, and resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) and key scenario 
analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: In the base case, incremental QALYs for KTE-X19 were 2.44, 3.26, and 
4.61 versus BLIN, INO, and CHEMO, respectively. Incremental costs were $50,913, 
$251,532, and $432,027, respectively, resulting in ICERs of $20,843/QALY (versus 
BLIN), $77,271/QALY (versus INO), and $93,768/QALY (versus CHEMO). Deterministic 
sensitivity analysis results were most sensitive to subsequent allogeneic stem 
cell transplant rates and post-progression utilities. PSA found that KTE-X19 is 
78.4%, 74.0%, and 75.4% likely to be cost-effective versus BLIN, INO, and CHEMO, 
respectively. Across most scenarios, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
$150,000/QALY, KTE-X19 was cost-effective versus all treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to current options for adults with R/R ALL, KTE-X19 is 
cost-effective, driven primarily by improved survival.

Plain Language Summary: Several treatments for adults with relapsed/refractory 
B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) have been approved in 
the past decade in the US, including blinatumomab (BLIN) and inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (INO). However, despite the high costs associated with these 
treatments, survival for patients remains poor. KTE-X19, an autologous anti-CD19 
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration in October 2021, has potential to improve survival, but its 
economic value has not yet been determined. This model comprehensively evaluated 
the long-term clinical and economic value of KTE-X19 versus current treatments, 
including BLIN, INO, and salvage chemotherapy (CHEMO). Inputs were derived from 
key clinical trials, the literature, and other publicly available sources. The 
model used the perspective of a US third party payer over a patient lifetime. 
Compared to BLIN, INO and CHEMO, KTE-X19 resulted in improved quality of life as 
measured with incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 2.44 (vs BLIN), 
3.26 (vs INO), and 4.61 (vs CHEMO). Treatment with KTE-X19 had incremental costs 
of $50,913 (vs BLIN), $251,532 (vs INO), and $432,027 (vs CHEMO). KTE-X19 was 
found to provide good value for money based on incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios of $20,843/QALY (vs BLIN), $77,271/QALY (vs INO), and $93,768/QALY (vs 
CHEMO). These values are well below the commonly accepted thresholds to 
determine economic value. Results were also found to be robust across 
sensitivity and scenario analyses.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been proven 
beneficial in several health care areas. Nevertheless, the uptake of AI in 
health care delivery remains poor. Despite the fact that the acceptance of 
AI-based technologies among medical professionals is a key barrier to their 
implementation, knowledge about what informs such attitudes is scarce.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and examine factors that 
influence the acceptability of AI-based technologies among medical 
professionals.
METHODS: A survey was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and 
Use of Technology model, which was extended by adding the predictor variables 
perceived trust, anxiety and innovativeness, and the moderator profession. The 
web-based survey was completed by 67 medical professionals in the Netherlands. 
The data were analyzed by performing a multiple linear regression analysis 
followed by a moderating analysis using the Hayes PROCESS macro (SPSS; version 
26.0, IBM Corp).
RESULTS: Multiple linear regression showed that the model explained 75.4% of the 
variance in the acceptance of AI-powered care pathways (adjusted R2=0.754; 
F9,0=22.548; P<.001). The variables medical performance expectancy (β=.465; 
P<.001), effort expectancy (β=-.215; P=.005), perceived trust (β=.221; P=.007), 
nonmedical performance expectancy (β=.172; P=.08), facilitating conditions 
(β=-.160; P=.005), and professional identity (β=.156; P=.06) were identified as 
significant predictors of acceptance. Social influence of patients (β=.042; 
P=.63), anxiety (β=.021; P=.84), and innovativeness (β=.078; P=.30) were not 
identified as significant predictors. A moderating effect by gender was found 
between the relationship of facilitating conditions and acceptance (β=-.406; 
P=.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Medical performance expectancy was the most significant predictor 
of AI-powered care pathway acceptance among medical professionals. Nonmedical 
performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived trust, and professional 
identity were also found to significantly influence the acceptance of AI-powered 
care pathways. These factors should be addressed for successful implementation 
of AI-powered care pathways in health care delivery. The study was limited to 
medical professionals in the Netherlands, where uptake of AI technologies is 
still in an early stage. Follow-up multinational studies should further explore 
the predictors of acceptance of AI-powered care pathways over time, in different 
geographies, and with bigger samples.

Aim: Spirituality is a crucial dimension in human health. However, it is often 
overlooked in patients with heart failure (HF) in Iran. Thus, the purpose of 
this study was to determine the relationship between spiritual wellbeing, life 
expectancy and quality-of-life (QOL) in patients with HF. Methods: This 
cross-sectional study was performed with 150 HF patients, who were enrolled 
through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a questionnaire 
comprising four parts: the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, 
Schneider's life expectancy instrument, Ellison's and Paulotzin's (1982) 
Spiritual Well-Being Scale, and a demographic checklist. SPSS software was used 
for data analysis. Results: In this study, mean and standard deviation of QOL, 
life expectancy and spiritual wellbeing were 41.82±19.17, 30.20±4.58 and 
87.80±5.28 respectively. There was a significant relationship between spiritual 
wellbeing and quality of life (r=-0.633, P<0.001) and also life expectancy 
(r=0.544, P<0.001). Quality of life and life expectancy were significantly 
higher in men than in women. Linear regression tests showed that the existential 
and religious dimensions of spirituality could influence 44.9% of the QOL 
variance (F=54.54, P<0.001) and increased values of existential spirituality 
would improve QOL by an average of 3.45 units. Improving life expectancy also 
raised QOL by 14.0% (F=21.26, P<0.001). This study also demonstrated that life 
expectancy is impacted by spiritual health, with a variance of 34.2%, in which 
the role of existential-spiritual health is of particular significance (t=7.10, 
P<0.001). Conclusion: The results revealed that spiritual wellbeing, especially 
the existential type, enhances life expectancy and quality-of-life among HF 
patients. Therefore, it is recommended that healthcare professionals design a 
comprehensive and supportive care model for the promotion of spiritual wellbeing 
in HF patients.

Human lifespan is known to correlate positively with education level. In the 
present paper, it is explored whether there are significant differences in 
lifespan among those whose education may be reasonably rated as the highest 
possible, i.e. among scholars referred to different scientific disciplines. The 
publications where the lifespans of scholars were estimated against the general 
population are reviewed, and the estimates are compared with those derived from 
the Database of Persons Included in Encyclopedias (DBPE), which has been being 
developed by the authors since 2008 based on Wikipedia records. With all caveats 
associated with the peculiarities of the procedures of including biographic data 
in Wikipedia, the estimates derived from the latest version of DBPE correspond 
to earlier estimates and confirm the conclusions based on other data sources: 
scholars' mean age at death (MAD) and life expectancy (LE) steadily increased 
since the Medieval period up to the modern time, were higher than those of the 
general population, and where the highest among the scientific elite. An 
unexpected finding was that MAD and LE of economists were usually the highest, 
whereas those of the mathematicians were lowest compared with specialists in 
other research fields. The difference between the two extreme cases ranges from 
ca. 3 to 5 years in different historical periods. Further examination of the 
difference between the extremes may reveal what factors behind it may be at work 
generally, even though they manifest themselves less overtly in other cases.

Publisher: Известно, что у людей продолжительность жизни положительно 
коррелирует с уровнем образования. В настоящей публикаций проверено, существуют 
ли систематические различия по продолжительности жизни между теми, кого можно 
отнести к наиболее образованным слоям населения, а именно между учеными 
различных специальностей. Сделан обзор публикаций, где было проведено сравнение 
показателей продолжительности жизни ученых и в общих популяциях. Известные 
результаты были сопоставлены с оценками среднего возраста смерти (СВС) и 
ожидаемой продолжительности жизни (ОПЖ), сделанными при использовании записей в 
Базе данных личностей энциклопедии (БДЛЭ), которая развивается авторами с 2009 
г. на основании биографических записей в Википедии. При всех оговорках 
относительно особенностей критериев и процедур включения биографий в Википедию, 
оценки, сделанные на основании записей в последней версии БДЛЭ, подтверждают 
выводы, опубликованные ранее и сделанные на основании других источников: СВС и 
ОПЖ ученых стабильно росли со средних веков до нашего времени и неизменно были 
выше, чем по популяциям в целом, причем наибольшими они были у представителей 
научных элит. Неожиданным оказалось то, что набольшие ОПЖ и СВС свойственны 
экономистам, а наименьшие — математикам. Различия между этими крайними случаями 
в разные исторические периоды составляли примерно 3–5 лет. Дальнейшее 
исследование этих крайностей может выявить факторы, имеющие более широкое 
значение, но действующие в других случаях менее заметно.

[Influence of age of patients with bronchopulmonary pathology on low-molecular 
DNA concentration in blood plasma.].

The aim of the work was to determine the concentration of low-molecular-weight 
plasma DNA (lmDNA) in patients with COPD and chronic non-obstructive bronchitis 
(CnonB) of two age groups - 34-59 and 60-80 years. The levels of lmDNA in 
healthy donors, patients with CnonB, healthy relatives of patients with COPD did 
not differ, while the concentration of lmDNA in patients with COPD was 
significantly lower. In COPD patients aged 34-59 years, the level of lmDNA was 
reduced by more than 7 times, and in COPD patients who survived to 60-80 years, 
it was 3 times lower compared to the value of this biochemical indicator in 
healthy donors of the same age. The reduction of lmDNA reflected a reduced 
systemic apoptotic activity in the body of patients with COPD. A significant 
difference in the concentration of lmDNA in patients with COPD and CnonB in 
remission can be used for differential diagnosis of the development of these 
pathological processes. An increase in the low level of lmDNA in COPD patients
