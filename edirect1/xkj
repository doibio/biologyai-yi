women as a global issue of major public health concern. The authors show that, 
while female life expectancy at birth is significantly different in developed 
and developing countries (because of high infant and maternal mortality in the 
latter), these differences tend to decrease for women in developing countries 
who reach middle age. The authors review the various facets of the "gender 
transition" brought about by demographic and epidemiological transitions, 
drawing attention to contrasts between the situation in developing countries in 
Asia and Latin America and that in Eastern Europe, for example. The role of 
older women as care-givers is discussed, as is the likelihood of a future 
increase in the proportion of older women living alone in the developing world 
(a factor which renders them particularly vulnerable in many socioeconomic and 
health respects). Suggestions are made on methodologies for monitoring health 
trends in aging women, and on the role of WHO in this respect. A basic goal for 
global strategies relating to the health of older women is formulated: reduction 
of the inequities in life expectancy between developed and developing countries.

QALYs and mental health care.

Chisholm D(1), Healey A, Knapp M.

Quality-adjusted life year measures (QALYs) have been fervently debated by 
researchers and decision makers concerned with resource allocation in the health 
care sector. They have been heralded as important aids to planning and priority 
setting, but also criticised on technical and ethical grounds. This paper 
examines these arguments with special reference to mental health care, the 
intention being to highlight the strengths and shortcomings of QALYs in this 
context. Issues pertinent to the application of QALYs in health care evaluation 
more generally are also reviewed. Whilst the rationale and underlying principles 
of the utility measurement approach are sound, the generic QALY as it is 
currently constructed represents an insensitive measure of the outcomes of 
mental health care. In the event of an increasingly QALY-driven priority-setting 
environment, however, abandonment of QALYs runs the risk of inappropriately 
marginalising people with mental illnesses in the resource allocation process. 
This opens up the possibility of developing a mental-health specific measure of 
utility that, in combination with cost data, would provide useful and 
appropriate summary information across treatments and programmes of mental 
health care.

Measuring the quality of life of severely mentally ill people using the 
Lancashire Quality of Life Profile.

(1)School of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Manchester University, UK.

Quality of life (QOL) has become an important outcome measure for many 
disorders, including mental illness. The Lancashire Quality of Life Profile 
(LQOLP) was developed for use in operational contexts, and has been translated 
into several languages. It is in use in several European and North American 
community psychiatric services. The present paper addresses the questions: how 
easy is it to use?; how reliable is it?; do the results of the LQOLP vary by 
setting in a meaningful way?; how do the results co-vary with measures of 
clinical symptoms and social functioning?; how well does it measure change?; is 
it clinically useful? While most of the answers to these questions are 
favourable, there is a need for further research and development of the profile, 
in particular with reference to the consequences of the use of the profile as a 
routine monitoring instrument and the most appropriate form of statistical 
analysis in longitudinal data-sets.

Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of 13CO2 laser laparoscopy in treating 
infertile women with minimal to mild endometriosis according the American 
Fertility Society classification in terms of pregnancy rates.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Medical school-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-six women whose infertility was associated with 
minimal or mild endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy.
INTERVENTIONS: The patients were treated with one of four methods: 49 underwent 
operative laparoscopy with newly developed 13CO2 laser vaporization and/or 
resection; 45 were treated by operative laparoscopy with simple monopolar 
electrocoagulation; 43 who had undergone only diagnostic laparoscopy did not 
receive any treatment; and 39 received danazol 800 mg/day for 3 months after 
diagnostic laparoscopy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Estimated cumulative pregnancy rates using life 
table analyses were indicators of treatment of success and compared among the 
treatments. A subgroup of 111 patients considered to have endometriosis as the 
only major infertility factor were also evaluated and compared among treatment 
options. Pregnancy rates in the CO2 laser laparoscopy group were significantly 
higher than in the other three groups and in endometriosis-only subset.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced laparoscopic surgery with the CO2 laser can be more 
efficient than other modalities in treating infertile women with minimal to mild 
endometriosis in terms of pregnancy rates. It appears that in experienced hands, 
laser laparoscopy has more favorable results than the other treatments.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness, in terms of pregnancy rates, of 
isotopic 13CO2 laser laparoscopy versus traditional laparoscopy or laparotomy in 
the treatment of infertile women with moderate or severe endometriosis.
DESIGN: Prospective 5-year study.
SETTING: Medical school-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS: Three hundred nine infertile women with moderate to severe 
endometriosis.
INTERVENTIONS: The patients were treated with one of four options: operative 
laparoscopy with the 13carbon dioxide (13CO2) laser vaporization and/or 
resection, operative laparoscopy with simple electrocoagulation and sharp 
dissection, laparotomy with electrocoagulation and sharp dissection, and medical 
treatment with danazol. Estimated cumulative pregnancy rates using life table 
analyses were indicators of treatment of success and compared among treatments. 
A subgroup of 192 women considered to have endometriosis as the only infertility 
factor was also evaluated.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pregnancy rates in the laparoscopy group were 
equal to or higher than those of the laparotomy group, for both the entire 
population and the endometriosis-only subset. When the CO2 laser was used as an 
adjuvant option, the rates were better, especially in patients with advanced 
disease and with endometriosis as the only infertility factor.
CONCLUSION: In women with endometriosis as the only infertility factor, 
laparoscopic surgery with the 13CO2 laser was more effective than nonlaser 
treatment.

Comment in
    J Gen Intern Med. 1997 Feb;12(2):134-5.

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the life expectancy of patients who have an 
abnormal videofluoroscopic swallowing study.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. The common starting point was the time of 
the severely abnormal swallowing study. Hospital charts were reviewed for 
clinical variables of potential prognostic significance by reviewers blinded to 
the outcome of interest, survival time.
SETTING: A university-affiliated, community teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred forty-nine hospitalized patients who were deemed nonoral 
feeders based on their swallowing study. Patients excluded were those with head, 
neck, or esophageal cancer, or those undergoing a thoracotomy procedure.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and demographic variables and time until 
death or censoring were measured. Overall 1-year mortality was 62%. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses identified four variables that 
independently predicted death: advanced age, reduced serum albumin 
concentration, disorientation to person, and higher Charlson comorbidity score. 
Eighty patients (54%) subsequently underwent placement of a percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube after their swallowing study.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high in patients with severely abnormal swallowing 
studies. Common clinical variables can be used to identify groups of patients 
with particularly poor prognoses. This information may help guide discussions 
regarding possible PEG placement.

Histopathology of breast cancer in relation to age.

Fisher CJ(1), Egan MK, Smith P, Wicks K, Millis RR, Fentiman IS.

Author information:
(1)ICRF Clinical Oncology Unit, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

Histological reports of 1869 consecutive women with invasive breast cancer have 
been reviewed to determine whether histological features of the tumour's were 
related to the patients' age. The patients, treated between 1983 and 1992, were 
divided into four groups, based on age. There were 148 aged < or = 39 years, 355 
aged 40-49 years, 984 aged 50-69 years and 382 aged 70 years or more. The most 
outstanding finding was the increase in incidence of grade III infiltrating 
ductal carcinoma in those aged < or = 39 years (P < 0.0001). Certain tumour 
types, in particular lobular, were reported more frequently in the oldest age 
group. Additionally, there was a significant reduction of axillary lymph node 
metastases, vascular invasion and lymphoplasmacytic stromal reaction with 
increasing age, all of which were independent of tumour grade. These data 
suggest that there may be age-related changes in the histology of breast cancer 
and, in some cases, less aggressive features in the elderly. However, as the 
life expectancy of women over the age of 70 may be many years, treatment should 
be based on histological prognostic features of the primary tumour rather than 
age alone.

Natural history of infrainguinal vein graft stenosis relative to bypass grafting 
technique.

Gupta AK(1), Bandyk DF, Cheanvechai D, Johnson BL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, University of South Florida College of Medicine, FL 
33606, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine whether the incidence of vein graft stenosis is related to 
bypass grafting technique and thus modification of postoperative surveillance 
protocols may be required.
METHODS: From 1991 to 1996, 338 infrainguinal vein bypasses constructed using in 
situ (n = 131), reversed (n = 120), nonreversed translocated (n = 48), or 
spliced/upper extremity vein (n = 39) grafting techniques were evaluated by 
intraoperative duplex scanning to optimize bypass construction and serially 
thereafter to detect developing vein graft stenoses. Bypass procedures were 
performed in 322 patients for critical limb ischemia (83%), claudication (13%), 
or popliteal aneurysm (4%). Using life-table analysis, graft patency and 
revision/failure rates were compared relative to grafting technique, need for 
operative revision, and intraoperative duplex scan results.
RESULTS: Three-year primary and secondary graft patency rates were higher (p < 
0.001) for in situ bypass grafts (85%/97%) compared with reversed (57%/83%), 
nonreversed translocated (62%/78%), or alternative (51%/76%) vein bypass grafts. 
During a mean follow-up interval of 19 months, the incidence of graft revision 
was higher for reversed saphenous (23%) and alternative (28%) vein bypass grafts 
compared with in situ (10%) or nonreversed (16%) saphenous vein bypass grafts. 
Despite a normal intraoperative graft duplex scan, the revision/failure rate of 
reversed vein grafts was 2.5 times greater than in situ/nonreversed translocated 
vein conduits (primary patency rate at 3 years, 60% vs 87%, p = 0.009). Bypass 
grafts modified at operation on the basis of duplex scanning were two times more 
likely to require postoperative revision than grafts with normal intraoperative 
scans.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative graft stenosis and need for revision 
varies with bypass grafting technique. Reversed vein bypasses and grafts 
modified at operation may be more prone than in situ vein bypass grafts to 
develop stenosis and thus require intensive surveillance. Infrainguinal vein 
graft failure and the need for revision may be reduced by the adoption of bypass 
grafting techniques that include valve lysis and intraoperative duplex scan 
assessment.

Autogenous aortoiliac/femoral reconstruction from superficial femoral-popliteal 
veins: feasibility and durability.

Clagett GP(1), Valentine RJ, Hagino RT.

Author information:
(1)University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9157, USA.

PURPOSE: Autogenous aortoiliac/femoral reconstruction with superficial 
femoral-popliteal veins (SFPVs) has been successfully used to treat prosthetic 
infection and failure, but outcome data are scant. In this prospective, 
observational study, we hypothesized that (1) replacement of the 
aortoiliac/femoral system with SFPVs could be performed with perioperative 
morbidity and mortality rates equal to those of conventional methods; (2) 
long-term patency rates would be excellent; (3) limb salvage rates would be 
correspondingly high; (4) aneurysmal degeneration would not occur, and (5) 
venous morbidity would be minimal.
METHODS: Since 1990, 41 patients have undergone complete or partial 
aortoiliac/femoral reconstruction with 63 SFPVs with a mean (+/-SD) follow-up 
time of 32 +/- 21 months. With the exception of two patients lost to follow-up, 
all have been observed at 6-month intervals with clinical examination and 
noninvasive tests.
RESULTS: There were no immediate operative deaths, but three patients (7.3%) 
died of multisystem organ failure after 1 month. Forty-nine percent of patients 
had significant perioperative complications including amputation (5%), 
compartment syndrome (12.3%), and pulmonary embolism (2.4%). Most patients (85%) 
had multilevel occlusive disease, and the mean SVS/ISCVS runoff score for the 
group was 4.9 +/- 2.6 (1 = normal, 10 = no runoff). Fifty-eight percent of all 
distal anastomoses were end-to-end, and in 68% of limbs the profunda femoris 
artery or superficial femoral artery was the sole runoff vessel. At 5 years, the 
cumulative secondary patency rate was 100%; primary patency rate, 83%; limb 
retention rate, 86%; and survival rate, 69%. Four patients had permanent limb 
edema controlled by compression stockings but none have had venous ulceration. 
There has been no aneurysmal dilation of SFPV grafts, and mean diameter shown by 
serial duplex imaging at 6 months (10.8 +/- 1.1 mm) was not significantly 
different from that at 60 months (7.8 +/- 1.1 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: Aortoiliac/femoral reconstruction with SFPVs is a successful and 
durable option for infection and other complex aortic problems.

Cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients.

Walsh DB.

(1)Section of Vascular Surgery, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, NH 03756, 
USA.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
carotid endarterectomy for treating asymptomatic patients with > or = 60% 
internal carotid stenosis, based on outcomes reported in the Asymptomatic 
Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS).
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov decision 
model in which the probabilities for base-case analysis (average age, 67 years; 
66% male; perioperative stroke plus death rate, 2.3%; ipsilateral stroke rate 
during medical management, 2.3% per year) were based on ACAS. The model assumed 
that patients who had TIAs or minor strokes during medical management crossed 
over to surgical treatment, and used the NASCET data to model the outcome of 
these now-symptomatic patients. Average cost of surgery ($8500), major stroke 
($34,000 plus $18,000 per year), and other costs were based on local cost 
determinations plus a review of the published literature. Cost-effectiveness was 
calculated as the incremental cost of surgery per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) saved when compared with medical treatment, discounting at 5% per year. 
Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of key variables on 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, surgical treatment improved quality-adjusted 
life expectancy from 7.87 to 8.12 QALYs, at an incremental lifetime cost of 
$2041. This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $8,000 per QALY 
saved by surgical compared with medical treatment. The high cost of care after 
major stroke during medical management largely offset the initial cost of 
endarterectomy in the surgical group. Furthermore, 26% of medically managed 
patients eventually underwent endarterectomy because of symptom development, 
which also decreased the cost differential. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
that the relative cost of surgical treatment increased substantially with 
increasing age, increasing perioperative stroke rate, and decreasing stroke rate 
during medical management.
CONCLUSION: For the typical asymptomatic patient in ACAS with > or = 60% carotid 
stenosis, our results indicate that carotid endarterectomy is cost-effective 
when compared with other commonly accepted health care practices. Surgery does 
not appear cost-effective in very elderly patients, in settings where the 
operative stroke risk is high, or in patients with very low stroke risk without 
surgery.

Carotid endarterectomy in adults 50 years of age and younger: a retrospective 
comparative study.

Levy PJ(1), Olin JW, Piedmonte MR, Young JR, Hertzer NR.

Author information:
(1)Department of Vascular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.

PURPOSE: Atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is the most common cause 
of stroke in young adults. We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics 
of premature CAS and the safety and durability of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) 
in 56 patients 50 years of age or younger (mean, 46.4 years; 34 (60%) males; 
group I) who underwent primary CEA at the Cleveland Clinic between 1983 and 
1993.
METHODS: The patients were identified from the Vascular Surgery Registry and 
were compared with 202 randomly selected patients 60 years of age and older 
(mean, 69.3 years; group II) who were frequency-matched by gender and the year 
of primary CEA. Carotid shunting was used routinely, and the arteriotomy was 
patched in the majority of cases. Patients were followed-up for mean of 47.2 
months (group I) and 46.0 months (group II).
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the indications for CEA 
(symptomatic CAS, 49% in group I vs 48% in group II) or the prevalence of 
diabetes, coronary diseases, and lower extremity arterial disease. Younger 
adults were more likely to have a history of smoking (93% vs 76%; p = 0.005), 
hypertension (71% vs 52%; p = 0.006), premature menopause (57% vs 18%; p < 
0.001) and had lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.03). 
There were no in-hospital deaths. Perioperative strokes in the distribution of 
the operated artery occurred within 24 hours in one younger patient (1.8%) and 
in one older patient (0.5%). This was attributed to early carotid thrombosis in 
the young patient. Major late postoperative neurologic complications were 
documented in one young patient (1.8%) and six older patients (3%). Patients in 
group I were at significantly higher risk for recurrent carotid stenosis (risk 
ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 7.3; p = 0.010); younger 
individuals remained at significantly higher risk for recurrent stenosis even 
after adjusting for smoking and hypertension (risk ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 
9.4; p = 0.006). By life-table analysis, younger adults tended to have a higher 
rate of late reoperations (p = 0.065).
CONCLUSIONS: CEA can be safely performed in young adults with premature CAS, 
although younger individuals appear to have higher rates of recurrent carotid 
stenosis compared with older counterparts.

BACKGROUND: Tubal sterilization is an increasingly common method of 
contraception in the United States. Although pregnancy after sterilization is 
uncommon, it can occur and may be ectopic. We used data from the U.S. 
Collaborative Review of Sterilization to estimate the risk of ectopic pregnancy 
in women who had undergone the common types of tubal sterilization.
METHODS: A total of 10,685 women undergoing tubal sterilization were followed in 
a multicenter, prospective cohort study. We intended to follow all the women for 
5 years by means of annual telephone interviews; for women enrolled early in the 
study, we attempted an additional follow-up telephone interview 8 to 14 years 
after sterilization. To assess the risk of ectopic pregnancy in these women, we 
used cumulative life-table probabilities and proportional-hazards analysis.
RESULTS: There were 47 ectopic pregnancies in the 10,685 women; the 10-year 
cumulative probability of ectopic pregnancy for all methods of tubal 
sterilization combined was 7.3 per 1000 procedures. The cumulative probability 
varied substantially according to the method of sterilization and the woman's 
age at the time of sterilization. Women sterilized by bipolar tubal coagulation 
before the age of 30 years had a probability of ectopic pregnancy that was 27 
times as high as that among women of similar age who underwent postpartum 
partial salpingectomy (31.9 vs. 1.2 ectopic pregnancies per 1000 procedures). 
The annual rate of ectopic pregnancy for all methods combined in the 4th through 
10th years after sterilization was no lower than that in the first 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: A history of tubal sterilization does not rule out the possibility 
of ectopic pregnancy, even many years after the procedure.

The results of partially matched related donor (PMRD) marrow transplantation for 
82 patients with leukemia are reported, including 45 who received two antigen 
disparate grafts. Following intensive radiochemotherapy, patients received 
grafts which were partially depleted of T cells by the monoclonal antibody T10B9 
and complement. Actuarial probability of engraftment was 86% (95% CI = 78-93%). 
The median day to engraftment was similar among recipients of grafts disparate 
at one, two or three antigen loci. The incidence of severe (grades III and IV) 
acute graft-versus-host disease and extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease 
was 13% and 6%, respectively. The probability of disease-free survival for the 
entire cohort of patients is 31% at 3 years. Age < or = 30 years, early or 
intermediate stage disease and a graft disparate at one or two loci predicted 
longer disease-free survival in multivariant analysis. Moreover, 47% of patients 
receiving PMRD grafts disparate at two loci who had both these favorable 
pretransplant characteristics were alive and free of disease 3 years after 
transplantation. We believe that the utilization of PMRDs, especially those with 
two antigen disparate grafts, can extend allogeneic transplantation to 
additional leukemic patients lacking a histocompatible donor, with acceptable 
results.

retrospectively reviewed 110 adults with NHL treated with ABMT from 1988 to 
1993. Overall survival and relapse-free survival were 50% and 35%, respectively. 
Estimated median relapse-free survival was 16 months. There was no statistically 
significant difference in relapse-free or overall survival by low, intermediate, 
and high-grade histologies, as defined by the International Working Formulation. 
The most powerful negative prognostic variable was an elevated LDH at the time 
of transplant (relapse-free survival 17% vs 42% for those with a normal LDH). 
Forty-seven patients were in complete remission 2 years after transplant. 
Extended follow-up revealed that 100% of patients with high-grade histologies 
remained in complete remission, whereas patients with intermediate-grade and 
low-grade histologies remained at risk of relapse with longer follow-up. Of 22 
patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (LCL) or immunoblastic (IBL) 
histologies, eight of eight with IBL remain in continued remission, while four 
of 14 with LCL relapsed 24-48 months after ABMT. We conclude that patients with 
high-grade histologic subtypes of NHL who are in complete remission 2 years 
after ABMT are likely to be cured. However, patients with intermediate and 
low-grade histologic subtypes are at continued risk of relapse and require 
appropriate clinical surveillance for at least 48 months after ABMT.

To evaluate a strategy of one cycle of dose-intensive chemotherapy for patients 
with Hodgkin's disease in sensitive relapse and two cycles for those with 
refractory disease, 122 patients received dose-intensive chemotherapy followed 
by autotransplant in two consecutive studies. Patients with refractory disease 
were offered a second transplant with different conditioning in the absence of 
progression or excessive toxicity. CR was present after treatment in 46% while 
16% died in the peritransplant period. Of 41 patients with primary refractory 
disease and 42 with refractory relapse, 24 and 21 respectively received a second 
cycle. Of these 45 refractory patients, 12 were in CR and 11 in PR after the 
first cycle and 10 of these 11 in PR achieved a durable CR with the second 
transplant. The CR rate is 37% in patients with refractory relapse and 19% in 
those with primary refractory disease. At a median follow-up of 4 years, median 
survival is 45 months. Progression-free survival of the refractory patients who 
could receive a second cycle was similar to that of patients with sensitive 
disease. A sequential transplant strategy is feasible. A subgroup of patients 
with refractory disease can achieve long-term survival after sequential BMT.

Aortic dissection is an acute and life-threatening pathology, early diagnosis 
and precise evaluation allow a correct treatment. Computed tomography diagnoses 
dissection, demonstrates the two aortic channels separated by the intimal flap 
and shows its place and extension. Aortic aneurysms are permanent and localized 
dilation of all wall components. They are usually asymptomatic until 
complications appear. Radiologic studies are essential for diagnosis and 
treatment. Ultrasound is the suitable technic for diagnoses and follow-up in 
uncomplicated patients. CT is an excellent method to evaluate aortic aneurysms 
and their complications before and after surgery. Angiography is useful to 
determine visceral branches involvement and to identify anatomic variations. 
Magnetic Resonance is a new option. Probably it will be the choice in the 
future.

[Successful aging: conceiving the aging process from a more positive 
perspective].

[Article in Spanish]

Vellas P(1).

In 1987 John Rowe introduced the concept of Successful Aging. This is a new 
point of view, and its appearance has been followed by a growing amount of 
literature and research on the subject. The author reviews the concept of 
Successful Aging and some of the results of his experimental work. The growing 
numbers of people who age successfully leads us to reconsider some of the 
concepts that continue to prevail about aging. It seems that we can think of 
aging as something more than progressive and irreversible functional 
deterioration. Throughout the text the author insists on: the heterogeneity of 
the aging process and the possibility of a preventive approach to avoid the 
disabilities associated with the aging process. Our current knowledge on the 
subject faces the challenge of establishing specific preventive measures that 
would lead to successful aging. Some factors identified as positively associated 
with successful aging are: belonging to a high socio-economic level, relatively 
low body weight good pulmonary function, good cognitive status, lack of diabetes 
and high blood pressure and sustained physical and social activities. The study 
of the successful aging process will lead us to a better understanding of the 
aging process itself, and will result in the identification of behaviors that 
should be promoted to optimize this life period. Existing evidence of a 
significant remaining plasticity even in the very old opens interesting 
perspectives of eventual correction of erratic aging.

There should be a change of attitude on the part of the medical profession 
towards the care of the chronic sick. When this is established, the change will 
be reflected in nursing and other hospital staff. A higher standard and a great 
deal more work is needed in the care of the chronic sick. The creation of a 
specialty for geriatrics would stimulate better work and initiate research. The 
chronic sick should be diagnosed and treated in special blocks of a general 
hospital set up and equipped for the purpose. Chronic aged sick should be 
admitted to homes only through hospital units. All homes for chronic sick should 
be attached to hospital units to ensure close follow-up work.

    Ann Intern Med. 1997 Oct 15;127(8 Pt 1):657-8.

BACKGROUND: The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) showed that 
carotid endarterectomy was beneficial for symptom-free patients with carotid 
stenosis of 60% or more. This finding raises the question of whether widespread 
screening to identify cases of asymptomatic carotid stenosis should be 
implemented.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a screening program to identify cases of 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis would be a cost-effective strategy for stroke 
prevention.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using published data from clinical trials.
SETTING: General population of asymptomatic 65-year-old men.
INTERVENTION: Patients who were screened for carotid disease with duplex Doppler 
ultrasonography were compared with patients who were not screened. If 
ultrasonography found significant carotid stenosis (> or = 60%), disease was 
confirmed by angiography before carotid endarterectomy was done.
MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and marginal 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: When the conditions and results of ACAS were modeled and it was assumed 
that the survival advantage produced by endarterectomy would last for 30 years, 
the lifetime marginal cost-effectiveness of screening relative to no screening 
was $120,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that 
marginal cost-effectiveness decreased to $50,000 or less per quality-adjusted 
life-year only under implausible conditions (for example, if a free screening 
instrument with perfect test characteristics was used or an asymptomatic 
population with a 40% prevalence of carotid stenosis was found).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery offers a real but modest absolute reduction in the rate of 
stroke at a substantial cost. A program to identify candidates for 
endarterectomy by screening asymptomatic populations for carotid stenosis costs 
more per quality-adjusted life-year than is usually considered acceptable.

Distinct mechanisms regulate TIMP-1 expression at different stages of phorbol 
ester-mediated differentiation of U937 cells.

Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

Upon exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (PMA), promonocyte-like 
U937 cells differentiate into macrophage-like cells and begin to express certain 
metalloproteinases and TIMP-1. We report here that distinct mechanisms regulate 
TIMP-1 production in PMA-treated U937 cells. TIMP-1 protein and steady-state 
mRNA levels increased about 10-fold in PMA-differentiated cells compared to 
undifferentiated cells. TIMP-1 transcription increased about 2.5-fold, but this 
stimulation was not detected until at least 48 h post-PMA. In contrast, the 
half-life for TIMP-1 mRNA increased about 3-fold and was detected at 8 h 
post-PMA. Using in vitro translation assays, we found that TIMP-1 mRNA from 
PMA-differentiated cells translated about 5-fold less efficiently than that from 
basal cells, suggesting structural differences in TIMP-1 mRNA in basal and 
differentiated U937 cells. Although primer extension and RNase protection 
analyses showed 5' heterogeneity of TIMP-1 transcripts, all forms were equally 
stimulated in response to PMA-mediated differentiation. The poly(A) tail length 
of TIMP-1 mRNA, however, was longer in PMA-treated cells. Our findings suggested 
that up-regulation of TIMP-1 expression in PMA treated U937 cells is mediated 
early by enhanced TIMP-1 mRNA stability, possibly related to increased poly(A) 
tail length, and later by an increase in transcription rate.

A retrospective quality of life analysis using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale in 
patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for advanced nonsmall cell lung 
cancer.

PURPOSE: To measure symptom palliation in patients treated with radiation 
therapy for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five hundred thirty patients with NSCLC were treated at 
the Medical College of Virginia between 1988 and 1993. Sixty-three patients with 
the least favorable prognostic features received palliative radiation to 30 Gy 
in 10 or 12 fractions for symptoms related to the presence of intrathoracic 
tumor. The observer portion of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) was employed 
in a retrospective chart review, scoring measures of appetite, fatigue, cough, 
dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain.
RESULTS: In 54 evaluable patients, median survival was 4 months and was 
independent of age, stage, performance status, or histology. Ninety-six percent 
of the patients had at least one LCSS symptom at presentation. Fatigue was 
unaffected by therapy. Improvements in appetite (p = 0.68) and pain (p = 0.61) 
were not statistically significant. There was, however, a statistically 
significant reduction in cough (p = 0.01), hemoptysis (p = 0.001), and dyspnea 
(p = 0.0003). Self-limiting acute side effects included transient esophagitis in 
37% of patients, though no severe toxicities were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest symptomatic benefit from radiotherapy even in 
those NSCLC patients with advanced disease and a limited life expectancy. 
Treatment should be given to patients whose symptoms are most amenable to 
palliation. A site-specific quality of life instrument such as the LCSS should 
be included within any future clinical trial of NSCLC management so that symptom 
control may be scored as a treatment outcome in addition to disease-free 
survival.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), an often fatal disease, is characterized 
by elevated pulmonary artery pressures in the absence of a secondary cause. 
Endovascular occlusion in the smallest pulmonary arteries occurs by 
proliferation of cells and matrix, with thrombus and vasospasm. Diagnosis is 
often delayed because the initial symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion 
are nonspecific and definitive diagnosis requires invasive procedures. The 
average life expectancy after diagnosis is two to three years with death usually 
due to progressive right heart failure. The aetiology of the disease is unknown. 
Although most cases appear to be sporadic, approximately 6% of cases recorded in 
the NIH Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Registry are inherited in an autosomal 
dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Following a genome-wide search using a 
set of highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers and 19 affected 
individuals from six families, initial evidence for linkage was obtained with 
two chromosome 2q markers. We subsequently genotyped patients and all available 
family members for 19 additional markers spanning approximately 40 centiMorgans 
(cM) on the long arm of chromosome 2. We obtained a maximum two-point lod score 
of 6.97 at theta = 0 with the marker D2S389; multipoint linkage analysis yielded 
a maximum lod score of 7.86 with the marker D2S311. Haplotype analysis 
established a minimum candidate interval of approximately 25 cM.

An efficient Statistical Analysis System computer program for the exact 
stratification of person-years is described, in order to determine the expected 
number of deaths or cases of diseases in a cohort for the calculation of 
standardized mortality ratios or standardized morbidity ratios. A comparison of 
this program with Macaluso's "Method B" program shows that the speed of the 
former is considerably faster than that of the latter, when the widths of the 
categories defined by all of the time factors are identical.

Geroprotector efficiency depends on viability of control population: life span 
investigation in D. melanogaster.

Ability of the radical spin trap 
4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-l-piperidine-N-oxyl (4-hydroxy-TemPO, (4HT)), to 
delay senescence in D. melanogaster has been studied. The spin trap, at a 
concentration of 0.2%, was added to the culture medium at the flies development 
stage. Reliable correlation (r = 0.76, P < 0.05) has been found between the 
viability of a control population, assessed by the mean life span (LS) value, 
and the level of LS alteration after geroprotector treatment in a corresponding 
experimental population. Thereby the local minimum values and local decreases in 
the mean LS in successive generations of the control line are associated most 
likely with LS extension effects in the corresponding experimental groups after 
4HT treatment, and on the contrary, the local maximum values and local increases 
in the mean LS of the control line are associated more probably either with LS 
decreasing effects in the corresponding experimental groups or with the lack of 
significant differences between the control and experimental groups. A possible 
mechanism of the discovered phenomenon is discussed, based on the concept about 
free-radical activity variations. A probability approach to the evaluation of 
geroprotector efficiency in serial studies is proposed.

There is substantial agreement among interspecies estimates of DNA repair 
activity.

Faithful maintenance of the genetic material is essential for cellular and 
organismal function. Thus the activity with which nuclear and mitochondrial DNA 
is repaired in somatic cells is likely to be an crucial determinant of maximal 
lifespan (MLS). However there has been controversy over both the actual rates of 
DNA repair in a variety of species, and the correlation of those rates with 
maximal lifespan. Five comparative studies of DNA repair have been re-analyzed 
with reference to an internal repair standard. Although some variance in 
measurements of DNA repair activity of the same species in different 
laboratories was observed, overall there is good agreement on the rank order of 
repair activity once those studies are internally calibrated. A six-fold range 
of relative DNA repair activity was observed, with mouse, rat and shrew lowest 
(0.9 to 1.0), and human and gorilla highest (4.5 to 5.3). The correlation 
between DNA repair activity and MLS was good, but not excellent (r2 = 0.845); a 
possible explanation is that active DNA repair is a necessary but not sufficient 
condition for long MLS. We investigated the kinetics of mitochondrial 
mutagenesis and tumorigenesis in mice and humans, and observed that each 
proceeds at a rate approximately 40-fold faster in mice than in humans. Thus one 
likely consequence of the deficiency of DNA repair in small rodents is an 
increased rate of mutagenesis and tumorigenesis. The large differences in 
metabolic investment in genomic maintenance in mice versus humans is a 
prediction of the disposable soma theory of aging, which is discussed.

Metallic stents in malignant biliary obstruction: prospective long-term clinical 
results.

(1)Department of Radiology, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the long-term 
clinical efficacy of metallic stents when used as the initial palliative 
treatment of patients with inoperable malignant biliary obstruction.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From August 1991 through May 1995, 100 consecutive 
patients with malignant biliary obstruction were treated with percutaneous 
placement of metallic stents. The causes of obstruction were bile duct carcinoma 
(n = 50), pancreatic carcinoma (n = 17), gallbladder carcinoma (n = 6), 
hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), and metastatic lymphadenopathy in the 
hepatoduodenal ligament (n = 25). We used 123 stents: 64 Gianturco Z stents, 39 
Hanaro spiral stents, 16 Wallstents, two tantalum Strecker stents, one Endocoil 
stent, and one Memotherm nitinol stent. Every 3 months we followed up all 
patients except those who died. The average length of follow-up was 220 days 
(range, 4-1125 days). Patient survival and stent patency rates were estimated by 
life-table analysis.
RESULTS: The median length of survival for the entire patient group was 246 
days: 25-week and 50-week survival rates were 62% and 25%, respectively. We 
found no statistically significant difference in the median length of survival 
between patients with hilar obstruction (256 days) and patients with common bile 
duct (CBD) obstruction (227 days). Patients with bile duct carcinoma had longer 
median survival (269 days) than did patients with other conditions (197 days). 
The overall median length of patency for all stents was 360 days; the 25-week 
and 50-week patency rates were 81% and 53%, respectively. The stent patency rate 
at the median length of survival was 71%. The median length of stent patency in 
patients with hilar obstruction (617 days) was nearly double that of patients 
with CBD obstruction (324 days). However, the median length of stent patency in 
patients with bile duct carcinoma showed no statistically significant difference 
from the median length in patients with other disease. Four patients (4%) died
