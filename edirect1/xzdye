Diverse and dynamic communities of ciliates and other microbes thrive in the 
natural environment, driving the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Many 
microbes are present in very low numbers or are dormant in the 'seedbank', 
escaping detection in environmental surveys and, consequently, remaining 
underexplored. Here, we report an extraordinarily rare ciliate that was 
discovered after persistent exploration of freshwater anoxic sediments - 
Legendrea loyezae Fauré-Fremiet, 1908, a member of the Family Spathidiidae, 
Order Haptorida. In this study, we present the sixth account of the ciliate 
since 1908 and reveal its phylogenetic position with the first 18S rRNA data for 
the genus. We explain the key morphological features of the species, describing 
a remarkable behaviour in which the ciliate "shapeshifts'' due to its ability of 
controlled full extension and retraction of its tube-like tentacles. Our results 
shed light on the similarity of L. loyezae to another ciliate that was first 
described as Legendrea bellerophon, later moved under a new genus and named 
Thysanomorpha bellerophon. We question the validity of this taxonomic decision 
and, based on morphological characters and tentacle movement, we propose moving 
T. bellerophon back under Legendrea. This study demonstrates how continued and 
persistent exploration of natural habitats lead to the discovery of microbial 
communities and species.

BACKGROUND: Recommendations and guidance from scientific bodies do not provide 
clear messages about potential health risks or benefits of coffee consumption. 
Numerous studies have demonstrated inverse (beneficial) effects of coffee 
consumption for many adverse outcomes such as cancer and cardiovascular disease; 
fewer studies demonstrate risks. However, the risk-benefit relationship has not 
yet been fully assessed using quantitative metrics preferred by policy makers 
(disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]).
OBJECTIVE: Conduct a quantitative analysis of the risk-benefit for coffee 
consumption and all-cause mortality using the Benefit-Risk Analysis for Foods 
(BRAFO) framework and the DALY as a quantitative metric.
METHOD: A systematic search and appraisal of meta-analyses investigating coffee 
consumption and all-cause mortality was conducted. Using the BRAFO framework, 
evidence was assessed in context of potential risks or benefits associated with 
the reference scenario - coffee consumption (assessed by varying the consumption 
level in three analyses) in adults aged 15+ versus the alternative scenario of 
no coffee consumption. DALYs were used to quantify risks and benefits based on 
risk ratios from meta-analyses with populations from the United States.
RESULTS: Meta-analyses consistently report an inverse (beneficial) relationship 
between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality; subsequently, even while 
varying consumption amounts and prevalence of coffee consumption, DALYs 
calculated consistently demonstrated findings in the direction of prevention of 
healthy years of life lost with variable magnitude. More than 3.5 million DALYs, 
or ∼3.35% of estimated years of healthy life lost could be prevented by 
consuming one cup of coffee per day, up to 4.7% of estimated years of healthy 
life lost could be prevented at current consumption rates ranging from 1 to 8 
cups/day, and even more benefit could be seen (prevention of an estimated 6% of 
years of healthy life lost) if consumers all drank 3 cups of coffee per day.
IMPACT: Policy that directs consumers to avoid drinking coffee may be a 
detriment to the overall health of the population given the substantial 
potential benefits of coffee consumption on all-cause mortality for adults.

BACKGROUND: Taking advantage of the rapidly increasing access to digital 
technology in low- and middle-income countries, the World Health Organization 
has launched an electronic version of the mental health Gap Action Programme 
intervention guide (emhGAP-IG). This is suitable for use on smartphones or 
tablets by non-specialist primary healthcare providers (PHCWs) to deliver 
evidence-based intervention for priority mental, neurological and substance use 
disorders. We assessed the perceptions of PHCWs on the feasibility, 
acceptability, and benefits of using smartphone-based clinical guidance and the 
emhGAP-IG in the management of people with mental health conditions in Nigeria.  
METHODS: Exploration of the views of PHCWs from 12 rural and urban primary 
health clinics (PHCs) in South-Western Nigeria were carried out using 34 
in-depth key informant qualitative interviews with nurses (n = 10), community 
health officers (n = 13) and community health extension workers (n = 11). An 
additional two focus group discussions, each comprising eight participants drawn 
from across the range of characteristics of PHCWs, were also conducted. Thematic 
analysis was conducted using a three-staged constant comparison technique to 
refine and categorise the data.
RESULTS: Three overall themes were identified around the use of clinical 
guidance and mobile applications (apps) in PHCs. Apps were deployed for purposes 
other than clinical consultation and decision making. Although paper-based 
guidance was the expected practice, its utilization is not fully embedded in 
routine care. An app-based decision-making tool was preferred to paper by PHCWs. 
Future usage of the emhGAP-IG would be facilitated by training and supporting of 
staff, helpful design features, and obtaining patients' buy-in.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the emhGAP-IG could be a viable way to 
embed clinical guidance and decision-making tools in the management of people 
with mental health conditions in Nigerian PHCs.

BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of people living with HIV increases with the 
advancements in antiretroviral treatment, the continuity of long-term therapy 
and health care for people living with HIV has gained more importance. However, 
the estimated proportion of people living with HIV who have access to treatment 
or are virally suppressed is unsatisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to build 
strategies to improve treatment continuity by identifying the barriers and 
facilitators that affect the HIV care continuum. To enable this, we will conduct 
a scoping review to explore the barriers and facilitators related to the care 
continuum in high-income countries for adults living with HIV.
METHODS: The review question will be identified based on the JBI guidelines for 
the development of scoping review protocols. Studies exploring the barriers to 
and facilitators of the HIV care continuum among adults living with HIV in 
high-income countries will be included in this review. A literature search will 
be conducted on the databases (platform) of MEDLINE (Ovid), Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCO), Embase (Ovid), and the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library). Four researchers will 
screen articles for inclusion and subsequently build a charting form and collate 
the data to provide results.
DISCUSSION: The results of this scoping review will provide comprehensive 
evidence for the barriers and facilitators to be considered in the care 
continuum of people living with HIV. Importantly, the results will provide 
insight for healthcare providers and researchers to develop interventions and 
research the continuity in caring for people living with HIV.

INTRODUCTION: Efficacy and safety of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor 
upadacitinib (UPA) was evaluated in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
through week 104 of the ongoing long-term extension of the phase 3 trial 
SELECT-PsA 1.
METHODS: Exploratory analyses of all primary and secondary endpoints 
(non-responder imputation and as observed for binary endpoints; mixed-effect 
model repeated measures and as observed for continuous endpoints), and summary 
of treatment-emergent adverse events, in patients receiving UPA 15 mg (UPA15) or 
30 mg (UPA30) once daily, or adalimumab 40 mg (ADA) every other week, through 
week 104 are reported.
RESULTS: Of 1704 patients, 25.4% discontinued the study drug by week 104. 
Proportions of patients achieving ≥ 20%/50%/70% improvement in American College 
of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20/50/70), ≥ 75%/90%/100% improvement in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI75/90/100), or minimal disease activity (MDA) were 
maintained through week 104; greater responses by nominal P value were observed 
with UPA15 and UPA30 versus ADA for ACR20/50/70 and MDA. Mean change from 
baseline in modified total Sharp/van der Heijde Score (mTSS) was similar across 
groups and to week 56 results. The safety profile of UPA was generally 
comparable to ADA and not altered from week 56 data. Rates of serious infection, 
herpes zoster, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and elevated creatine 
phosphokinase remained numerically higher with UPA15 and/or UPA30 versus ADA. 
Rates of malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), major adverse 
cardiovascular events, and venous thromboembolism were similar across groups; 
rates of NMSC were higher with UPA versus ADA. Two deaths were reported with 
UPA15, one with UPA30, and one with ADA.
CONCLUSIONS: In PsA patients, efficacy responses were similar or greater with 
UPA15 or UPA30 versus ADA through week 104, and inhibition of radiographic 
progression was maintained. No new safety risks were identified with exposure to 
UPA through 2 years (week 104).

New treatments have increased the life expectancy of pediatric patients 
diagnosed with malignant hematological diseases, often at the cost of 
protracting their immunocompromised state in the form of prolonged neutropenia. 
This neutropenic state favors the development of bacterial and fungal 
infections. Moreover, recent years have seen a series of changes in the 
epidemiology of fungal and Clostridium infections. These changes necessitate 
adaptations to the management of pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia, 
who are at risk of further increases in already high rates of morbidity and 
mortality. This article discusses the current bases for the management of 
febrile neutropenia and associated emerging fungal infections, as well as the 
epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile in pediatric 
patients diagnosed with malignant hematological diseases.

The median survival time of newly-diagnosed MS patients without severe 
disabilities is approximately 30-35 years. The prognosis after the onset of 
severe disability has not been reported. Based on Harding et al.'s 2018 study of 
the Southeast Wales MS registry, we calculated life expectancies according to 
the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Upon loss of independent ambulation 
(EDSS 6-6.5; mean age 51.2) life expectancy was 13.3 additional years. At EDSS 
9-9.5 (mean age 70.8) life expectancy was 1.1 additional years. These figures 
provide an empirical basis for discussions of advanced MS care planning.

Pavlovian conditioning paradigms model the learned fear associations inherent in 
posttraumatic stress disorder, including the renewal of inappropriate fear 
responses following extinction learning. However, very few studies in humans 
investigate the underlying neural mechanisms involved in fear renewal despite 
its clinical importance. To address this issue, our lab designed a novel, 
immersive-reality Pavlovian fear acquisition, extinction, recall, and renewal 
paradigm. We utilized an ecological threat - a snake striking towards the 
participant - as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Context and background were 
dynamic and included both visual and auditory cues that are relevant to everyday 
life. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral measures (US 
expectancy ratings), we examined the validity of this Novel paradigm in healthy 
adults (n = 49) and compared it to a Standard, well-validated 2D paradigm 
(n = 28). The Novel paradigm, compared to the Standard, was associated with 
greater hippocampal activation throughout the task. Participants who underwent 
the Standard paradigm, compared to the Novel, also displayed insula activation; 
however, this was not specific to stimulus or time. During fear renewal, the 
Novel paradigm was associated with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation 
to CS+ (> CS-). Overall, we found that our Novel, immersive-reality paradigm, 
which features an ecologically relevant US, elicited greater corticolimbic 
activation. These results suggest that immersive Pavlovian fear conditioning 
paradigms paired with innately fearful stimuli may improve translatability of 
preclinical paradigms to clinical interventions for fear-based disorders.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Head and neck cancer (HNC) describes a range of malignant 
tumours that arise from the epithelium of the mucous membranes in the head and 
neck region, including the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, and 
paranasal sinuses. In Hungary, oral cancer is among the top ten causes of 
cancer-related death (Diz et al., 2017 [1]). In Romania, HNC mortality has 
increased by more than 50 % in the last decade, and in Poland, HNC is the 
seventh most common type of cancer (Diz et al., 2017, Pinkas et al., 2022 
[1,2]). To inform priorities for cancer control, this analysis estimated the 
mortality burden and cost of lost productivity due to premature HNC-deaths in 
Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The model used years of life lost (YLL), years of 
productive life lost (YPLL) and present value of future lost productivity 
(PVFLP).
METHODS: We modelled patients who died from HNC in Hungary, Poland, and Romania 
in a single year and utilised epidemiological inputs and economic inputs to 
estimate YLL, YPLL, PVFLP and PVFLP/death.
RESULTS: HNC resulted in 9729 annual deaths and 157,328 YLL in Hungary, Poland, 
and Romania. PVFLP was estimated to be €449 million, (€87 million, €193 million, 
€169 million, in Hungary, Poland and Romania respectively) with a total 
PVFLP/HNC-death of €46,158.
CONCLUSION: HNC leads to substantial societal costs in Hungary, Poland, and 
Romania. Given the number of premature deaths and associated productivity loss, 
reducing HNC burden should be a priority for policymakers.
POLICY SUMMARY: Given the severe clinical and economic burden of HNC, a 
multidisciplinary approach is required to reduce this burden, including 
prevention policies and improved diagnostic techniques to promote early 
diagnosis. Improvements in preventative measures will not only decrease 
productivity losses relating to HNC but would also have a huge impact across 
other cancer indications (e.g., lung and cervical cancers) and other illnesses 
linked to these policy areas (e.g., heart disease and diabetes).

Patients with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty maintaining independent living 
abilities as the disease progresses, causing an increased burden of care on 
family caregivers and the healthcare system and related financial strain. This 
patient group is expected to continue to expand as life expectancy climbs. 
Current diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease are complex, unaffordable, and 
invasive without regard to diagnosis quality at early stages, which urgently 
calls for more technical improvements for diagnosis specificity. Optical 
coherence tomography or tomographic angiography has been shown to identify 
retinal thickness loss and lower vascular density present earlier than symptom 
onset in these patients. The retina is an extension of the central nervous

Ophthalmological examinations can be an efficient tool to offer a window into 
cerebral pathology with the merit of easy operation. In this review, we 
summarized the latest observations on retinal pathology in Alzheimer's disease 
and discussed the feasibility of retinal imaging in diagnostic prediction, as 
well as limitations in current retinal examinations for Alzheimer's disease 
diagnosis.

Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (HSD), an autosomal recessive biotin cycle 
disorder, is caused by holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) genetic variants, 
resulting in multiple carboxylase deficiency. Catabolic stress can induce 
metabolic crises in patients with HSD. Although pharmacological doses of biotin 
have improved HLCS enzyme activity and HSD prognosis, the prolonged life 
expectancy has gradually highlighted novel issues in adult patients with HSD. To 
the best of our knowledge, there is only one report on a case of HSD during 
pregnancy and childbirth, and the metabolic profile was not well defined. In 
this report, we present the history and metabolic profile of a woman with HSD 
who had an uncomplicated pregnancy and childbirth. A high pharmacological dose 
of biotin, 100 mg/day, had no effect on the fetus. Even during the emergency 
cesarean section, the detailed metabolic assessments revealed no significant 
laboratory findings, such as ketolactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and remarkable 
acylcarnitine change. This report suggests that a woman with HSD who regularly 
takes biotin can conceive and give birth safely, and biotin doses of 100 mg/day 
may not influence the growth and development of the fetus. Further research and 
case studies on pregnant women with HSD are required to determine an acceptable 
maximum dosage of biotin for human fetuses.

INTRODUCTION: Thyroglossal duct cysts are a common congenital anomaly in the 
neck which usually present in adulthood as a midline neck swelling the location 
of which can vary from lingual, suprahyoid, infrahyoid and suprasternal.
CASE REPORT: Here we have described the case of a thirty-year-old male who 
presented with a history of recent onset dysphonia and an unnoticed neck 
swelling. Clinical examination revealed a midline 2 x 2 cm cystic lesion in the 
neck. On further evaluation using laryngoscopy and computed tomography the 
patient was found to have a smooth mucosa-covered cyst in the subglottic 
location. Surgical excision of the cyst was done via laryngofissure and the 
postoperative course was uneventful. The postoperative biopsy revealed a 
subglottic thyroglossal cyst.
CONCLUSIONS: Though there have been reports of intralaryngeal extension of 
thyroglossal duct cysts, the subglottic location is extremely rare. Through this 
case report, we would like to highlight the atypical presentation of 
thyroglossal duct cysts and how an innocuous pathology can turn potentially 
life-threatening. We would also recommend avoiding a fine needle aspiration 
cytology in such cases due to the critical location.

OBJECTIVES: Psoriasis is a skin disease thought to be related to immune system 
dysfunction. Our study is aimed at analyzing the prevalence of psoriasis in 
China in multiple different categories and compared the prevalence at the global 
level, in order to bring insights to policymakers for treating this disease.
METHODS: We analyzed psoriasis trends from 1990 to 2019 in China as well as 
around the globe with data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. 
Multiple metrics such as age-standardized prevalence rates, percent change in 
age-standardized prevalence rates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
age and sex patterns were included. We also predicted the trends of psoriasis 
prevalence and DALYs in the following 30 years.
RESULTS: In China, the age-specific prevalence cases showed a right shift in 
2019 compared to 1990 with a peak between the ages of 50 and 54 years and an 
obvious surpass in males between 40 and 69. Though China still had the largest 
number of psoriasis cases in 2019, the increase rate was below global level. A 
positive linear relationship between psoriasis prevalence and comorbidities was 
seen with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, 
nonrheumatic valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, nonmelanoma 
skin cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in China within the male 
group in 2019. Discussion. The burden of psoriasis, as measured by the absolute 
number of DALYs, continues to increase around the world. The scarcity of 
modifiable risks for most psoriasis burdens suggests that new knowledge is 
needed to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Fruits and vegetables are healthy because they contain good 
nutrients and secondary metabolites that keep the body healthy and disease-free. 
Post-harvest losses of fresh fruits and vegetables limit access and availability 
as a result of foodborne infections and poor storage technologies. The selection 
of fruits and vegetables depend on the starting microbial load, the size of 
fruits and vegetables, and the type of infrastructure.
SCOPE AND APPROACH: Despite the positive impacts of conventional thermal 
(roasting, boiling, blanching) and some non-thermal processing techniques such 
as High Pressure Processing (HPP), Pulse Electric Field (PEF), Cold Plasma 
Technology (CPT) on shelf-life extension, their use is commonly associated with 
a number of negative consequences on product quality such as cold plasma 
treatment increases the acidity and rate of lipid oxidation and further decrease 
the colour intensity and firmness of products. Similarly, in high pressure 
processing and pulse electric field there is no spore inactivation and they 
further limit their application to semi-moist and liquid foods. On that account, 
food irradiation, a non-thermal technique, is currently being used for 
post-harvest preservation, which could be very useful in retaining the keeping 
quality of various fresh and dehydrated products without negatively affecting 
their versatility and physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory properties.
CONCLUSION: Existing studies have communicated the effective influence of 
irradiation technology on nutritional, sensory, and physico-chemical properties 
of multiple fruits and vegetables accompanying consequential deduction in 
microbial load throughout the storage period. Food irradiation can be recognized 
as a prevalent, safe and promising technology however, still is not fully 
exploited on a magnified scale. The consumer acceptance of processed products 
has always been a significant challenge for innovative food processing 
technologies such as food irradiation. Therefore, owing to current review, 
additional scientific evidences and efforts are still demanded for increasing 
its technological request.

Here, through this review, we aim to serve this purpose by first discussing the 
statistics and aging demographics, including the life expectancy of the world 
and India, along with the gender life expectancy gap observed throughout the 
world, followed by explaining the hallmarks and integral causes of aging, along 
with the role played by senescent cells in controlling inflammation and the 
effect of senescence associated secretory phenotype on longevity. A few of the 
molecular pathways which are crucial in modulating the process of aging, such as 
the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, insulin signaling, Nrf2, FOXO, PI3-Akt, 
Sirtuins, and AMPK, and their effects are also covered in paramount detail. A 
diverse number of ingenious research methodologies are used in the modern era of 
longevity exploration. We have attempted to cover these methods under the 
umbrella of three broad categories: in vitro, in vivo, and in silico techniques. 
The drugs developed to attenuate the aging process, such as rapamycin, 
metformin, resveratrol, etc. and their interactions with the above-mentioned 
molecular pathways along with their toxicity have also been reviewed in detail.

More and more children and adolescents are affected by excess weight and 
obesity. Particularly serious are the associated secondary diseases such as 
diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, high blood pressure, joint changes, and mental 
disorders. Experts of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
estimate that excess-weight-related diseases will cause 90 million deaths in the 
next 30 years and shorten life expectancy by about 3 years. Obesity and excess 
weight in childhood and adolescence are global health problems that are often 
not adequately diagnosed and treated. Prevention works and should begin as early 
as childhood and adolescence.

Immer mehr Kinder und Jugendliche sind von Übergewicht und Adipositas betroffen. 
Besonders schwerwiegend sind dabei die damit verbundenen Folgeerkrankungen wie 
z. B. Diabetes mellitus, Fettleber, Bluthochdruck, Gelenksveränderungen und 
psychische Störungen. Experten der Organisation für wirtschaftliche 
Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung gehen davon aus, dass übergewichtbedingte 
Erkrankungen in den nächsten 30 Jahren 90 Mio. Todesfälle verursachen und die 
Lebenserwartung um etwa 3 Jahre verkürzen werden. Adipositas und Übergewicht im 
Kindes- und Jugendalter ist ein weltweites Gesundheitsproblem, das vielfach 
nicht adäquat diagnostiziert und behandelt wird. Prävention wirkt und sollte 
bereits im Kindes- und Jugendalter beginnen.

The knee joint is the second largest joint in the human body, with a wide range 
of functional activities and strong support for the human body. Moreover, the 
cartilage of the knee joint is hyaline cartilage, which is relatively brittle, 
so it is most vulnerable to trauma. In clinical work, the damage of articular 
cartilage is a disease with a high rate of orthopedic visits. In this paper, all 
the experimental group cases included in the observation were patients with 
acute articular cartilage injury or OA diagnosed by knee arthroscopy. All 
experimental groups and control groups did not have any strenuous exercise one 
day before MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and they sat for 30 minutes before 
the examination. Conventional scanning sagittal FSE-T1WI, FSE-T2WI, FS-FSE-T1WI, 
FS-FSE-T2WI, FS-PDWI, and coronal FS-PDWI sequence. In the normal control group, 
after the T2 color map was generated in the workstation, the articular cartilage 
was divided on the midsagittal plane, and the patellar cartilage and tibial 
plateau were roughly divided into upper, middle, lower and anterior, middle, and 
posterior thirds. In order to ensure the maximum comparability of the results, 
an artificial intelligence segmentation algorithm is used to divide the region 
of interest equally, and the central part of each partition is selected as much 
as possible for measurement. The T2 values of the three partitions of each 
cartilage were measured one by one and averaged. For the comparison results of 
T2 value of cartilage in the same part: according to patellar cartilage, femoral 
cartilage, and tibial cartilage, the P values are 0.973, 0.150, and 0.525, 
respectively. Therefore, early detection and early treatment of articular 
cartilage injury are of great significance to the performance of athletes' 
competition level and the extension of sports life.

INTRODUCTION: The Oswestry Spinal Risk Index (OSRI) was designed to predict life 
expectancy of patients presenting with spinal metastases. It integrates the most 
predictive items of existing scores and is calculated using not more than two 
items: General condition and primary tumor.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to externally validate the OSRI 
in a large cohort and to compare it with the established scores.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 211 consecutive surgical 
patients with symptomatic spinal metastases. We collected clinical and 
radiographic data, such as Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), Frankel Status, 
primary tumor pathology and metastatic spread to calculate the Tokuhashi score, 
Tomita score, modified Bauer score and the OSRI. Logistic regression models, 
Kaplan-Meyer-curves, discriminant power and variance analyses were applied using 
Harrell's C-index and Cox and Snell's Pseudo R².
RESULTS: Predicted and actual survival of our cohort's patients correlated 
significantly in each investigated scoring systems (p < 0.001). In test quality 
measurements Tokuhashi score performed best (C = 0.7204; R² = 0.3619), followed 
by OSRI (C = 0.7023; R² = 0.2612), Tomita (C = 0.6748; R² = 0.2818) and modified 
Bauer score (C = 0.6653; R² = 0.2486). Accuracy of predicted life expectancy was 
highest in modified Bauer score and OSRI.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Compared to the original scores, the OSRI provided 
equal or even superior results in assessing our study population's life 
expectancy. Its particular advantage lies in the simplicity of its application, 
which well meets the demands of surgical decision-making in daily practice.

Many animals form long-term monogamous pair bonds, and the disruption of a pair 
bond (through either divorce or widowhood) can have significant consequences for 
individual vital rates (survival, breeding, and breeding success probabilities) 
and life-history outcomes (lifetime reproductive success [LRS], life 
expectancy). Here, we investigated the causes and consequences of pair-bond 
disruption in wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). State-of-the-art 
statistical and mathematical approaches were developed to estimate divorce and 
widowhood rates and their impacts on vital rates and life-history outcomes. In 
this population, females incur a higher mortality rate due to incidental fishery 
bycatch, so the population is male-skewed. Therefore, we first posited that 
males would show higher widowhood rates negatively correlated with fishing 
effort and females would have higher divorce rates because they have more mating 
opportunities. Furthermore, we expected that divorce could be an adaptive 
strategy, whereby individuals improved breeding success by breeding with a new 
partner of better quality. Finally, we posited that pair-bond disruptions could 
reduce survival and breeding probabilities owing to the cost of remating 
processes, with important consequences for life-history outcomes. As expected, 
we showed that males had higher widowhood rates than females and females had 
higher divorce rates in this male-skewed population. However, no correlation was 
found between fishing effort and male widowhood. Secondly, contrary to our 
expectation, we found that divorce was likely nonadaptive in this population. We 
propose that divorce in this population is caused by an intruder who outcompetes 
the original partner in line with the so-called forced divorce hypothesis. 
Furthermore, we found a 16.7% and 18.0% reduction in LRS only for divorced and 
widowed males, respectively, owing to missing breeding seasons after a pair-bond 
disruption. Finally, we found that divorced individuals were more likely to 
divorce again, but whether this is related to specific individual 
characteristics remains an important area of investigation.

THEORY: Digital technologies have become an integral part of everyday life that 
children are exposed to. Therefore, it is important for children to acquire an 
understanding of these technologies early on by teaching them computational 
thinking (CT) as a part of STEM. However, primary school teachers are often 
reluctant to teach CT. Expectancy-value theory suggests that motivational 
components play an important role in teaching and learning. Thus, one hindrance
