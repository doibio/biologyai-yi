follow-up study and UK Biobank data.
METHODS: In 1985, 363 members of the Swiss AS Patient Society and 806 relatives 
were screened clinically and then radiographically for AS/axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Life expectancy was analysed in 377 axSpA patients 
having available pelvic radiographs and HLA-B27 status, comparing with matched 
Swiss population data. Survival in relation to HLA-B27 status in the general 
population was studied in UK Biobank European-ancestry participants (n=407 480, 
n=30 419 deaths).
RESULTS: AS patients have increased standardised mortality rate (SMR) compared 
with the general population (1.37, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.62). This increase was 
significant for HLA-B27-positive AS (SMR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.65). Shortened 
life expectancy was observed among both HLA-B27-positive AS women (SMR 1.77, 95% 
CI 1.09 to 2.70) and men (SMR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59). Patients with 
non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) had significantly lower SMR: 0.44 (95% CI 0.23 
to 0.77), compared with the general population. In the UK Biobank 
European-ancestry population cohort, HLA-B27 carriage was not significantly 
associated with any change in mortality (HR 1, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.1, p=0.349, 
adjusted by sex), in either males (HR 1, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.1, p=0.281) or females 
(HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.9 to 1, p=0.232), and no increase in vascular disease 
mortality was observed.
DISCUSSION: AS patients, but not nr-axSpA patients, have a significantly 
shortened life expectancy. Increased mortality is particularly significant among 
women with HLA-B27-positive AS. HLA-B27 carriage in the European-ancestry 
general population does not influence survival, or the risk of death due to 
vascular disease.

We use a unique data set from Spain and we estimate life expectancy at age 50 
for males and females by place of residence and place of birth. We show that, 
consistent with expectations regarding the influence of early conditions on 
adult health and mortality, the effects of place of birth on adult mortality are 
very strong, irrespective of place of residence. Furthermore, we find that 
mortality levels observed in a place are strongly influenced by the composition 
of migrants by place of birth. This is reflected in a new measure of 
heritability of early childhood conditions that attains a value in the range 
0.42-0.43, implying that as much as 43 percent of the variance in Spain's life 
expectancy at age 50 is explained by place of birth. Finally, we find evidence 
of the healthy migrant effect, that is, positive health selection of migrants, 
at a regional level.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the working life expectancies (WLE) of men and women 
with depression, examining depression by symptom trajectories from the late 20s 
to early 50s, and to estimate WLE by race/ethnicity and educational attainment.
METHODS: Data from 9206 participants collected from 1979 to 2018 in the US 
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort were used. Depression was 
measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Short Form 
at four time points (age 28-35, age 30-37, age 40, and age 50). Labor force 
status was measured monthly starting at age 30 until age 58-62. Depressive 
symptom trajectories were estimated using growth mixture modeling and multistate 
modeling estimated WLE from age 30-60 for each gender and depressive symptom 
trajectory.
RESULTS: Five latent symptom trajectories were established: a persistent low 
symptom trajectory (n = 6838), an episodic trajectory with high symptoms 
occurring before age 40 (n = 995), an episodic trajectory with high symptoms 
occurring around age 40 (n = 526), a trajectory with high symptoms occurring 
around age 50 (n = 570), and a persistent high symptom trajectory (n = 277). The 
WLE for men at age 30 was 30.3 years for the persistent low symptom trajectory, 
22.8 years for the episodic before 40 trajectory, 19.6 years for the episodic 
around age 40 trajectory, 18.6 years for the episodic around age 50 trajectory, 
and 13.2 years for the persistent high symptom trajectory. Results were similar 
for women. WLE disparities between depression trajectories grew when stratified 
by race/ethnicity and education level.
CONCLUSIONS: Roughly a quarter of individuals experienced episodic depressive 
symptoms. However, despite periods of low depressive symptoms, individuals were 
expected to be employed ~5-17 years less at age 30 compared to those with low 
symptoms. Accessible employment and mental health disability support policies 
and programs across the working life course may be effective in maintaining work 
attachment and improving WLE among those who experience depression.

BACKGROUND: Bangladesh outperforms its Least Developed Country (LDC) status on a 
range of health measures including life expectancy. Its frontline medical 
practitioners, however, are not formally trained medical professionals, but 
instead lightly-trained 'village doctors' able to prescribe modern 
pharmaceuticals. This current study represents the most complete national survey 
of these practitioners and their informal 'clinics'.
METHODS: The study is based on a national Computer Assisted Telephone 
Interviewing (CATI) of 1,000 informal practitioners. Participants were sampled 
from all eight divisions and all 64 districts of Bangladesh, including 682 
participants chosen from the purposively recruited Refresher Training program 
conducted by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, 
Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), supplemented with 318 additional participants recruited 
through snowball sampling.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: In addition to demographics, village 
doctors were asked about the characteristics of their 'clinics' including their 
equipment, their training, income and referral practices.
RESULTS: Three quarters of the wholly male sample had not completed an 
undergraduate program, and none of the sample had received any bachelor-level 
university training in medicine. Medical training was confined to a range of 
short-course offerings. Village doctor 'clinics' are highly dependent on the 
sale of pharmaceuticals, with few charging a consultation fee. Income was not 
related to degree of short-course uptake but was related positively to degree of 
formal education. Finally, practitioners showed a strong tendency to refer 
patients to the professional medical care system.
CONCLUSIONS: Bangladesh's village doctor sector provides an important pathway to 
professional, trained medical care, and provides some level of care to those who 
cannot afford or otherwise access the nation's established healthcare system. 
However, the degree to which relatively untrained paramedical practitioners are 
prescribing conventional medicines has concerning health implications.

BACKGROUND: Childhood dementias are a group of rare and ultra-rare paediatric 
conditions clinically characterised by enduring global decline in central 
nervous system function, associated with a progressive loss of developmentally 
acquired skills, quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Traditional 
research, service development and advocacy efforts have been fragmented due to a 
focus on individual disorders, or groups classified by specific mechanisms or 
molecular pathogenesis. There are significant knowledge and clinician skill gaps 
regarding the shared psychosocial impacts of childhood dementia conditions. This 
systematic review integrates the existing international evidence of the 
collective psychosocial experiences of parents of children living with dementia.
METHODS: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We systematically searched four databases to 
identify original, peer-reviewed research reporting on the psychosocial impacts 
of childhood dementia, from the parent perspective. We synthesised the data into 
three thematic categories: parents' healthcare experiences, psychosocial 
impacts, and information and support needs.
RESULTS: Nineteen articles met review criteria, representing 1856 parents. 
Parents highlighted extensive difficulties connecting with an engaged clinical 
team and navigating their child's rare, life-limiting, and progressive 
condition. Psychosocial challenges were manifold and encompassed physical, 
economic, social, emotional and psychological implications. Access to 
coordinated healthcare and community-based psychosocial supports was associated 
with improved parent coping, psychological resilience and reduced psychological 
isolation. Analysis identified a critical need to prioritize access to 
integrated family-centred psychosocial supports throughout distinct stages of 
their child's condition trajectory.
CONCLUSION: This review will encourage and guide the development of 
evidence-based and integrated psychosocial resources to optimise quality of life 
outcomes for of children with dementia and their families.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the possible advantages of a simple spinal cord (SC) 
dose-limiting three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) technique in 
comparison to conventional two-dimensional (2D) techniques and other 3D-CRT 
techniques for spinal bone irradiation.
METHODS: For 41 spinal target volumes, seven different techniques were 
evaluated, using a standard schedule of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The SC 
dose-limiting 3D-CRT technique 1F2S-18MV using a single posterior field (F) 
supplemented by two anterior segment fields (S) and 18-MV photon beams was 
compared to two conventional 2D techniques (a single posterior field, PA, and 
two opposed anterior-posterior fields, APPA), three other 3D-CRT techniques (a 
single posterior field supplemented by four segment fields, 1F4S; two wedged 
fields, WD, and the SC dose-limiting variant using 6 MV, 1F2S-6MV) along with 
the original clinically applied plans.
RESULTS: 1F2S-18MV demonstrated notably better results for all target volume 
parameters compared to the conventional 2D techniques (p < 0.001). Limitation of 
the SC dose was significantly superior with 1F2S-18MV in comparison to PA and 
APPA (SC Dmean: 28.9 ± 0.4  vs. 30.1 ± 0.6 Gy and 30.1 ± 0.4 Gy; SC Dmax: 
30.9 ± 0.7  vs. 32.5 ± 1.0 Gy and 31.8 ± 0.7 Gy; SC D1cm3 : 30.1 ± 0.6  vs. 
31.7 ± 0.9 Gy and 31.1 ± 0.6 Gy; p < 0.001). Likewise, lower mean SC doses with 
1F2S-18MV were observed in comparison to the more treatment time-consuming 
3D-CRT techniques (1F4S, WD) and the original plans without relevant compromises 
on the dose homogeneity in the target volume and the dose exposure to the other 
OARs.
CONCLUSION: In treatment planning of spinal metastases, simple variants of 
3D-CRT-techniques like 1F2S-18MV can offer a significant dose limitation to the 
SC while providing a sufficient dose coverage of the target volume. Especially 
in patients with favorable life expectancy and potential need for 
re-irradiation, such SC dose-limiting 3D-CRT techniques may be a reasonable 
approach.

Biopolymers derived from seafood processing byproducts are used to prepare 
active and biodegradable films as the packaging of food products. These films 
possess bioactivities to enhance the shelf life of packed foods by proactively 
releasing antimicrobial/antioxidative agents into the foods and providing 
sufficient barrier properties. Seafood processing byproducts are an eminent 
source of valuable compounds, including biopolymers and bioactive compounds. 
These biopolymers, including collagen, gelatin, chitosan, and muscle proteins, 
could be used to prepare robust and sustainable food packaging with some 
antimicrobial agents or antioxidants, for example, plant extracts rich in 
polyphenols or essential oils. These active packaging are not only biodegradable 
but also prevent the deterioration of packed foods caused by spoilage 
microorganisms as well as chemical deterioration. Seafood discards have a 
promising benefit for the development of environmentally friendly food packaging 
systems via the appropriate preparation methods or techniques. Therefore, the 
green packaging from seafood leftover can be better exploited and replace the 
synthetic counterpart.

BACKGROUND: Despite a significant share of Nigeria's budget in the health 
sector, the health status has not improved, as reflected by poor health 
indicators.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the linkages between government expenditure 
and health outcomes in Nigeria.
METHODS: The Autoregressive Distributed Lag technique was used to examine the 
short- and long-run effects of government health expenditure on health outcomes 
separately. The health outcome was captured by life expectancy at birth and 
mortality rate.
RESULTS: Findings show a negative relationship exists between health expenditure 
and mortality rate, implying that a rise in health expenditure leads to a 
decrease in mortality rate, while life expectancy at birth positively responds 
to the changes in health expenditure.
CONCLUSIONS: As a policy recommendation from this study, the government should 
pursue increasing health expenditure and partner with the private sector in the 
form of Public-Private Partnerships to improve the health sector and outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of osilodrostat in 
patients with Cushing's disease.
METHODS: The multicenter, 48-week, Phase III LINC 4 clinical trial had an 
optional extension period that was initially intended to continue to week 96. 
Patients could continue in the extension until a managed-access program or 
alternative treatment became available locally, or until a protocol amendment 
was approved at their site that specified that patients should come for an 
end-of-treatment visit within 4 weeks or by week 96, whichever occurred first. 
Study outcomes assessed in the extension included: mean urinary free cortisol 
(mUFC) response rates; changes in mUFC, serum cortisol and late-night salivary 
cortisol (LNSC); changes in cardiovascular and metabolic-related parameters; 
blood pressure, waist circumference and weight; changes in physical 
manifestations of Cushing's disease; changes in patient-reported outcomes for 
health-related quality of life; changes in tumor volume; and adverse events. 
Results were analyzed descriptively; no formal statistical testing was 
performed.
RESULTS: Of 60 patients who entered, 53 completed the extension, with 29 
patients receiving osilodrostat for more than 96 weeks (median osilodrostat 
duration: 87.1 weeks). The proportion of patients with normalized mUFC observed 
in the core period was maintained throughout the extension. At their 
end-of-trial visit, 72.4% of patients had achieved normal mUFC. Substantial 
reductions in serum cortisol and LNSC were also observed. Improvements in most 
cardiovascular and metabolic-related parameters, as well as physical 
manifestations of Cushing's disease, observed in the core period were maintained 
or continued to improve in the extension. Osilodrostat was generally well 
tolerated; the safety profile was consistent with previous reports.
CONCLUSION: Osilodrostat provided long-term control of cortisol secretion that 
was associated with sustained improvements in clinical signs and physical 
manifestations of hypercortisolism. Osilodrostat is an effective long-term 
treatment for patients with Cushing's disease.

BACKGROUND: In this study, the clinical effect of lamivudine combined with 
leflunomide and methylprednisolone in the treatment of hepatitis B 
virus-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN) and their influence on renal 
function indexes was explored.
METHODS: Patients with HBV-GN were selected for retrospective analysis and 
divided into the group B and group A, with 41 cases in each group. The group B 
was given leflunomide and methylprednisolone, whereas the group A was 
supplemented with lamivudine. The level of 24 h proteinuria (PRO), albumin 
(ALB), beta2-microglobulin (β2-MG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in two groups was measured. 
The clinical efficacy, adverse reactions appetite, spirit, sleep and daily life 
scores of the two groups were recorded.
RESULTS: With the extension of treatment time to end of the treatment, the level 
of 24 h PRO, ALB and β2-MG in the group A significantly changed compared with 
that before treatment (p < 0.05). Moreover, the level of ALT, IFN-γ and IL-4 in 
the two groups significantly decreased compared with that before treatment, and 
the level of the three indexes in the group A decreased more significantly (p < 
0.05). The total effective rate in the group A was higher than that in the group 
B (p < 0.05). The occurrence of adverse reactions showed no statistically 
significant difference between the two groups. After treatment, scores of 
appetite, spirit, sleep and daily living were increased in the two groups, and 
the increase in the group A was more significant than that in the group B (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine combined with methylprednisolone and leflunomide 
treatment is conducive to clearing Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and improving renal 
function.

OBJECTIVES: Healthcare systems in European countries, including METEOR partner 
countries, are faced with the aging population, an increase in costs for 
innovative technologies and medication, a shortage of health professionals, and 
inequality in access to healthcare. Presented paper aimed to recognize and 
compare the functioning of healthcare systems between METEOR partner countries 
and simultaneously check if the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 
has some relationship with the number of medical staff, yearly gross domestic 
product, or documented percentage of fully vaccinated people.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the model of descriptive epidemiological study, 
available demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare organizational data in the 
Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Poland were compared to the epidemiological 
situation of the COVID-19 pandemic (percentage of fully vaccinated people, 
incidence, and mortality) in all mentioned countries.
RESULTS: Obtained data confirmed that the lowest number of physicians, as well 
as the life expectancy and gross domestic product per capita, is in Poland. 
Simultaneously, the lower number of medical staff and lower gross domestic 
product (GDP) correspond to higher mortality due to COVID-19. The percentage of 
fully vaccinated with the last dose of the primary series was also the lowest in 
Poland.
CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results confirmed that higher mortality due to COVID-19 in 
METEOR participants' countries is related to a lower number of medical staff and 
weaker GDP. The worse situation was noted in Poland, a country with problems in 
the functioning healthcare system, including hospital care and a serious 
shortage of practicing medical staff. Int J Occup Med Environ Health.

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: Acute mesenteric ischemia is especially seen in the 
elderly population. It has an increasing incidence in today's world where the 
average life expectancy is increasing. Early diagnosis is the most important 
factor reducing morbidity and mortality, and there is still no marker with high 
sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis.In this study, we aimed to find 
a more sensitive and specific serum marker in the early diagnosis of mesenteric 
ischemia by comparing thiol with the currently used markers C-reactive protein 
and lactate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study, 32 Wistar Albino male rats, 10-12 weeks 
old, weighing 250-300 g, were used. 32 rats were divided into 4 groups, one of 
which was the control group. The superior mesenteric artery of the other 3 
groups was ligated. Blood samples were taken after 2 hours from the first group, 
4 hours from the second group, and 6 hours from the third group. Then the rats 
were sacrificed. Mesenteric ischemia and its level were observed in sacrificed 
subjects. The samples were separated under appropriate conditions and analyzed 
biochemically.
RESULTS: As the ischemia time increased, CRP increased and this increase was 
found to be statistically insignificant (p>0.05). The changes in lactate were 
found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference between the 
changes of total and native thiol values was found to be statistically 
significant (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Although CRP is a non-specific parameter in the early diagnosis of 
acute mesenteric ischemia, lactate maintains its importance as seen in our 
study. Differences in total thiol and native thiol changes were statistically 
significant. The fact that this significant difference is observed at the 4th 
hour values, reveals the importance of these parameters in early diagnosis. 
Thanks to the economic and fast results of thiol parameters, it is thought that 
new studies to be added to the literature can lead to the diagnosis of 
mesenteric ischemia.

Higher education has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, reducing the 
risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, slowing the rate of age-related 
cognitive decline, and is associated with lower rates of early mortality. In the 
present study, the association between higher education, fragile X messenger 
ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat number, and 
mortality before life expectancy was investigated in a population cohort of 
women born in 1939. The findings revealed a significant interaction between 
years of higher education and CGG repeat number. Counter to the study's 
hypothesis, the effects of higher education became more pronounced as the number 
of CGG repeats increased. There was no effect of years of higher education on 
early mortality for women who had 25 repeats, while each year of higher 
education decreased the hazard of early mortality by 8% for women who had 30 
repeats. For women with 41 repeats, the hazard was decreased by 14% for each 
additional year of higher education. The interaction remained significant after 
controlling for IQ and family socioeconomic status (SES) measured during high 
school, as well as factors measured during adulthood (family, psychosocial, 
health, and financial factors). The results are interpreted in the context of 
differential sensitivity to the environment, a conceptualization that posits 
that some people are more reactive to both negative and positive environmental 
conditions. Expansions in CGG repeats have been shown in previous FMR1 research 
to manifest such a differential sensitivity pattern.

BACKGROUND: Infections with influenza viruses cause severe illness, substantial 
number of hospitalization and death, especially in older adults. However, few 
studies have focused on the burden of influenza lower respiratory tract 
infections (LRTIs) solely in older adults, particularly in low-resource 
settings.
AIMS: We aimed to estimate the mortality and DALYs of influenza LRTIs for people 
aged 55 years and older in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study was used to obtain data 
on mortality and DALYs of influenza LRTIs at the global, regional, and country 
levels.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global rates for mortality and DALYs of influenza LRTIs 
were 6.46 per 100,000 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 2.37-12.62] and 97.39 per 
100,000 (95% UI: 34.70-187.03). Although the rates for mortality and DALYs in 
people aged 55 years and older decreased from 1990 to 2019, the absolute numbers 
for both increased by 85.84% and 66.56%, respectively. Both the absolute numbers 
and rates of deaths and DALYs of influenza LRTIs were higher in male than in 
female in all age groups. Although low-socio-demographic index (SDI) regions 
experienced the largest declines for the rates of mortality and DALYs of 
influenza LRTIs over the past three decades, they still had the highest rates 
for mortality and DALYs in all age groups. Moreover, the absolute numbers and 
rates of deaths and DALYs of influenza LRTIs showed an increasing trend with 
age, reaching the peak in the people over 85 years old.
DISCUSSION: Burden of influenza LRTIs in older adults is still high and could 
continue to grow along with global aging.
CONCLUSION: Efforts to improve vaccination for influenza are needed for 
preparedness of another influenza pandemic, especially in low-SDI regions.

People with learning disabilities are known to experience a wide range of health 
inequalities and have a lower life expectancy than the general population. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic this extended to higher mortality rates following 
infection with the novel coronavirus. This case study presents an example of a 
positive outcome for Jade, a 21-year-old woman with learning disabilities and 
autism who required a long period in intensive care following COVID-19 
infection. It demonstrates the impact of effective multidisciplinary 
collaboration involving the acute hospital learning disability liaison nurse and 
Jade's family, leading to a wide range of reasonable and achievable adjustments 
to her care.

OBJECTIVE:  To present the update of the recommendations of the Brazilian 
College of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, the Brazilian Society of Mastology 
and the Brazilian Federation of Associations of Gynecology and Obstetrics for 
breast cancer screening in Brazil.
METHODS:  Scientific evidence published in Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, 
EBSCO, CINAHL and Lilacs databases between January 2012 and July 2022 was 
searched. Recommendations were based on this evidence by consensus of the expert 
committee of the three entities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:  Annual mammography screening is recommended for women at usual 
risk aged 40-74 years. Above 75 years, it should be reserved for those with a 
life expectancy greater than seven years. Women at higher than usual risk, 
including those with dense breasts, with a personal history of atypical lobular 
hyperplasia, classic lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical ductal hyperplasia, 
treatment for breast cancer or chest irradiation before age 30, or even, 
carriers of a genetic mutation or with a strong family history, benefit from 
complementary screening, and should be considered individually. Tomosynthesis is 
a form of mammography and should be considered in screening whenever accessible 
and available.

BACKGROUND: Conducting a distinct comparison between the life expectancy (LE) 
and healthy life expectancy (HALE) of people with disabilities (PWDs) and the 
general population is necessary due to the various environmental and health 
conditions they encounter. Therefore, this study aimed to develop the life table 
for PWDs and calculate those of LE and HALE based on sex, severity, and 
disability types among the registered Korean PWDs.
METHODS: We used aggregated data of registered PWDs from the Korea National 
Rehabilitation Center database between 2014 and 2018. Overall, 345,595 deaths 
were included among 12,627,428 registered PWDs. First, we calculated the LE for 
total PWDs and non-disabled people using a standard life table, extending the 
old age mortality among nine models. Subsequently, we calculated the LE for each 
type of disability using the relationship between the mortality of total PWDs 
and those of each type of disability. Finally, HALE was calculated using the 
Sullivan method for three types as follows: disability-free and perceived health 
(PH) using the National Survey, and hospitalized for  ≥ 7 days using the Korea 
National Health Insurance System (NHIS) database.
RESULTS: The calculated LE/HALE-NHIS (years) at registration in males and 
females were 81.32/73.32 and 87.38/75.58, 68.54/58.98 and 71.43/59.24, 
73.87/65.43 and 78.25/67.51, and 61.53/50.48 and 62.41/49.72 years among 
non-disabled, total PWDs, mild disabled, and severe disabled, respectively. 
LE/HALE-NHIS was lowest and highest in respiratory dysfunction and hearing 
disabilities, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Males with disabilities had shorter LE and HALE at registration 
than females, except for those with severe disabilities, and there were 
variabilities in the LE based on the disability types.
