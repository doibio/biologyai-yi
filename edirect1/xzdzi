health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of edentulous patients treated with 
conventional complete dentures (CCDs) and mandibular overdentures (IODs) with a 
short anteroposterior spread (S-APS) or a large antero-posterior spread (L-APS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Edentulous patients were treated with CCDs and 
subsequently randomly allocated to receive a bar clip mandibular overdenture 
retained by 2 interforaminal implants (Control) or 4 (Test: 2 additional 
implants distal to the mental foramen). The Oral Health Impact Profile Edent 
questionnaire (OHIP-20E) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were applied at a 
mean follow-up of 38.5 months to assess the impact on OHRQoL and DS, 
respectively. Comparisons between the type of prosthesis and the extension of 
the AP spread were made with Student's t test for paired samples and for 
independent samples, respectively, at a significance level of 5%.
RESULTS: The IODs had significantly lower OHRQoL values ​​in the dimensions 
"functional limitation" (p=0.03), "physical pain" (p=0.02), "psychological 
discomfort" (p<0.01), "disability physical" (p<0.01) and "general score" 
(p<0.01) (n=20 patients). The IODs presented DS values ​​significantly for 
"aesthetics" (p=0.04), "stability" (p=0.03), "masticatory capacity" (p<0.01), 
"function" (p<0.01) and "oral condition" (p=0.03). The S-APS group (control) 
resulted in significantly lower values ​​in the dimensions "physical pain" 
(p<0.01) and "general score" (p<0.01) and no domain with statistical difference 
in the VAS scale.
CONCLUSIONS: IODs significantly improved OHRQoL and DS. The increase in AP 
spread did not result in benefits for the patient's OHRQOL and DS in this 
clinical study. (Study Protocol Number: 1.452.492) CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
Implantology has experienced in the last 20 years a permanent evolution that aim 
at increasing predictability and improving long-term clinical performance. 
Placement of short implants distally to the mental foramen, for instance, and 
the resulting increase of the anterior-posterior spread, is a promising approach 
and is worthy of investigation.

Analysis of host genetic polymorphisms is an increasingly important tool for 
understanding and predicting pathogenesis and treatment response of viral 
diseases. The gene locus of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), encoding 
a cell entry factor and receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV), contains several 
genetic polymorphisms. We applied a probe extension assay to determine the 
frequency of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the SR-BI gene 
locus in 374 individuals with history of HCV infection. In addition, 
SR-BI messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were analyzed in liver biopsy specimens of 
chronically infected HCV subjects. The rs5888 variant allele T was present at a 
higher frequency in subjects with advanced fibrosis (χ2 , p = 0.016) and after 
adjusting for age, duration of infection and alcohol intake as confounding 
factors. Haplotype analysis of SNP frequencies showed that a haplotype 
consisting of rs61932577 variant allele C and rs5888 variant allele T was 
associated with an increased risk of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by an 
Ishak score 4-6) (adjusted odds ratio 2.81; 95% confidence interval 1.06-7.46. 
p = 0.038). Carriers of the rs5888 variant allele T displayed reduced SR-BI mRNA 
expression in liver biopsy specimens. In conclusion the rs5888 polymorphism 
variant is associated with decreased SR-BI expression and an increased risk of 
development of advanced fibrosis in chronic HCV infection. These findings 
provide further evidence for a role of SR-BI in HCV pathogenesis and provides a 
genetic marker for prediction of those infected individuals at greater risk of 
developing severe disease.

INTRODUCTION: uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in care are 
associated with increased life expectancy but increased the risk of comorbid 
conditions in persons living with HIV (PLWH) and taking antiretroviral drugs. 
This study describes comorbid conditions among PLWH in Ghana.
METHODS: PLWH (n=222) out of a sample population of 900, randomly selected at 
Pantang ART Center participated in the study from June to July of 2020. 
Socio-demographic characteristics, HIV biomarkers, medication type and 
adherence, and diagnostic confirmed chronic conditions were extracted from 
medical records of PLWH. Cox proportional-hazard models and Kaplan-Meier curves 
graphing risk of experiencing comorbid conditions were performed. Log-rank test 
was performed at p<0.05.
RESULTS: fifty three point two percent of PLWH (222) experienced a comorbid 
condition including, respiratory conditions (17.6%), anaemia (12.2%), 
hypertension (12.2%), cardiovascular diseases (10.8%),and neurological 
conditions (10.8%).Factors associated with some of these conditions were 
medication adherence (aHR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.21-0.90) and visual changes (aHR=2.64, 
95% CI: 1.08-6.45) for respiratory conditions, age (aHR=10.03, 95% CI; 
1.22-82.37) for hypertension, and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical 
stages (stage II (aHR=13.36, 95% CI=1.54-115.63) and III (aHR=11.71, 95% 
CI=1.41-97.26))for peripheral neuropathy. Kaplan-Meier curves show significant 
risk of comorbid conditions for age, CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm2, WHO clinical 
stages III and IV, and ART non-adherence.
CONCLUSION: understanding the types of comorbidities in PLWH is integral to 
providing feedback to primary care providers to monitor.

Pes planus is a common foot and ankle physiologic deformity. The normal medial 
longitudinal arch is depressed or flattened due to a lack of strength in 
associated muscles, ligaments, and tendons. This study aimed to investigate how 
isokinetic hip muscular strength affected normal medial longitudinal arch feet 
and pea planus. Forty adult subjects participated in this study: 20 with pea 
planus and 20 with normal medial longitudinal arched feet. Both groups were 
similar in age (p=.074), weight (p=.324), height (p=.211), and BMI (p=.541). The 
navicular drop test determined the differences in navicular height. An 
isokinetic dynamometer was used to determine hip muscular strength (peak torque 
and total work) during hip flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction at 
speeds of 90°/s and 180°/s. A Kruskal-Wallis test was computed to determine the 
comparison between the normal medial longitudinal arch and pea planus. Subjects 
with normal medial longitudinal arch had more muscle strength than pes planus. 
Hip muscle strength did not show any significant difference between both groups. 
The abductor and adductor group muscles' total work were higher in subjects with 
pes planus. This study showed that normal medial longitudinal arched foot 
subjects have higher muscle strength than pes planus. However, the hip abductors 
were significantly lower in pes planus after measuring the total work, 
suggesting that individuals with pes planus are easily fatigued, possibly due to 
the overuse of the muscles that compensate for any changes in lower limb 
alignment.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the association between different dimensions of 
religiosity - organizational, non-organizational and intrinsic - and physical 
and functional health indicators in older people in Chile.
METHODS: Data from the Fifth Survey on Quality of Life in Old Age 2019 were 
used. Descriptive and explanatory analyses were performed using logistic, linear 
and multinomial regression models, with dependent variables being 
self-perception of health, functional dependence, number of chronic diseases and 
perception of health compared with other people of the same age. As predictors, 
indicators of the three dimensions of religiosity (DUREL Scale) were included, 
controlling for the MOS-SS Social Support Scale, Apgar Family Functioning Scale, 
educational level, gender, age, and living with a partner.
RESULTS: Almost a third of older Chileans attend religious services frequently, 
and half of them pray frequently. On a range of 1 to 5, the mean intrinsic 
religiosity is 3.94. 46% perceive their health to be good/very good and about 
half perceive their health as better than their peers. On 0 to 5, the mean 
number of chronic diseases is 1.69. 6% are classified as functionally dependent. 
The only significant relationship observed was between religious attendance and 
a lower probability of presenting functional dependency; on the other hand, 
praying increases such probabilities and a relationship between attendance and a 
better perception of health compared with other people of the same age.
CONCLUSION: Organisational religiosity is a psychosocial resource that is 
positively associated with the process of successful aging.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Establecer la asociación entre distintas dimensiones de 
religiosidad - organizacional, no organizacional e intrínseca- y diversos 
indicadores de salud física y funcional en personas mayores en Chile.
MÉTODOS: Se utilizaron datos de la Quinta Encuesta de Calidad de Vida en la 
Vejez del 2019. Se realizaron análisis descriptivos y explicativos, utilizando 
modelos de regresión logística, lineal y multinomial, teniendo como variables 
dependientes autopercepción de salud, dependencia funcional, número de 
enfermedades crónicas y percepción de la salud en comparación con otras personas 
de la misma edad. Como predictores se incluyeron indicadores de las tres 
dimensiones de religiosidad considerada (Escala DUREL), controlando por Escala 
de Apoyo Social percibido MOS-SS, Escala de Funcionamiento Familiar de Apgar, 
nivel educativo, género, edad y vivir con una pareja.
RESULTADOS: Casi un tercio de los mayores chilenos asiste de manera frecuente a 
servicios religiosos, y la mitad reza frecuentemente. En un rango de 1 a 5, la 
media de religiosidad intrínseca es de 3.94. Un 46% se percibe con buena/muy 
buena salud y cerca de la mitad se percibe con mejor salud que otras personas de 
la misma edad. En un rango de 0-5, la media de enfermedades crónicas es de 1.69 
y un 6% es clasificado como dependiente funcional. Solo se encontró una relación 
significativa entre asistencia religiosa y una menor probabilidad de presentar 
dependencia funcional, mientras que por el contrario rezar aumenta dichas 
probabilidades; además de una relación entre asistencia y mejor percepción de 
salud en comparación con otras personas de la misma edad.
CONCLUSIÓN: la religiosidad organizacional es un recurso psicosocial que se 
asocia positivamente con el proceso del envejecimiento exitoso.

Uveo-Meningitis and Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

Ferrão D(1), Ribeirinho-Soares P(1), Almeida J(1).

Author information:
(1)Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de São João, Porto, Portugal.

Uveo-meningeal syndromes are any disorder characterized by the involvement of 
the uvea and the meninges. They can have multiple causes, including infectious, 
autoimmune and malignant diseases. We report the case of a patient with a 
10-year-old diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome that had been stable. He 
presented with new onset uveitis, ataxia, diplopia and fluctuating consciousness 
level, without any obvious cause revealed by brain imaging or blood chemistries. 
An extensive aetiological search showed no obvious cause. Initially, the patient 
improved spontaneously and was discharged. However, 2 months later, he 
deteriorated once again, this time with disperse adenomegalies that were not 
present previously. The bone marrow biopsy showed a high number of blasts, which 
affirmed the progression of the previously known myelodysplastic syndrome. The 
lymph nodes were not biopsied due to very low life expectancy, making the 
procedure futile. A presumptive diagnosis of uveo-meningitis caused by 
paraneoplastic syndrome was made. The patient died a few months later.
LEARNING POINTS: Uveo-meningeal syndrome (UMS) is a rare entity usually of 
infectious or inflammatory aetiology.UMS may be caused by some neoplastic 
disorders, mainly lymphoma and metastasis of solid tumours; myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) has not been previously implicated.Diagnosis should include 
lumbar puncture and a thorough search for the aetiology; treatment is directed 
towards the aetiology.

Cercospora leaf spot (CLS; causal agent Cercospora beticola Sacc.) is endemic in 
many sugar beet production regions due to the widespread distribution of C. 
beticola and the inability of current management practices to provide complete 
control of the disease. Roots harvested from plants with CLS, therefore, are 
inevitably incorporated into sugar beet root storage piles, even though the 
effects of CLS on root storage properties are largely unknown. Research was 
conducted to determine the effects of CLS on storage properties including root 
respiration rate, sucrose loss, invert sugar accumulation, loss in recoverable 
sucrose yield, and changes in sucrose loss to molasses with respect to CLS 
disease severity and storage duration. Roots were obtained from plants with four 
levels of CLS severity in each of three production years, stored at 5°C and 95% 
relative humidity for up to 120 days, and evaluated for storage characteristics 
after 30, 90, and 120 days storage. No significant or repeatable effects of CLS 
on root respiration rate, sucrose loss, invert sugar accumulation, loss in 
recoverable sucrose yield, or change in sucrose loss to molasses were detected 
after 30, 90, or 120 days storage regardless of the severity of CLS disease 
symptoms. Therefore, no evidence was found that CLS accelerates sugar beet 
storage losses, and it is concluded that roots harvested from plants with CLS 
can be stored without additional or specialized precaution, regardless of CLS 
symptom severity.

Why we need more methods for male contraception.

Nieschlag E(1), Nieschlag S(1).

Author information:
(1)Centre of Reproductive Medicine and Andrology, University Hospitals Münster, 
Münster, Germany.

The US Supreme Court decision against abortion has once again triggered the call 
for male contraception. However, in addition to existing methods, there are 
further reasons why pharmacological reversible easy-to-use male contraception 
should be available. Green activists and environmentalists have to recognize 
that overpopulation consume resources. Medical progress results in increasing 
life expectancy and must be combined with contraception. Sharing the risks of 
contraception among partners and "Reproductive Autonomy for All" are ethical 
issues. The resistance of the pharmacological industry to becoming partners in 
male contraception must be overcome by public financial subsidies and popular 
demand.

AIMS: High systolic blood pressure (HSBP), a significant public health 
challenge, has not been systematically studied in the elderly population in the 
context of global aging. Understanding the temporal trends of the disease burden 
associated with HSBP in the elderly population is essential to control and 
mitigate the harm caused by HSBP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the estimated data derived from the Global Burden 
of Disease Study to analyse the disease burden of HSBP among the elderly 
population by region, sex, and temporal changes from 1990 to 2019. We found that 
the number of deaths due to HSBP increased to 7.86 (95% UI: 6.89-8.82) million, 
with an increase of 54.1%, and the number of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) increased to 146 (95% UI: 130-162) million, with an increase of 52.4%. 
Conversely, the death and DALY rates of HSBP decreased by -27.0 and -27.8%, 
respectively. At the national and regional levels, Australasia and other high 
socio-demographic index regions have made significant improvements in the burden 
of HSBP, while it remains high in other regions of the world. Additionally, the 
burden of HSBP in older men is greater than that in older women.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the current prevention and control of 
HSBP in older adults is poor, with the total burden increasing significantly. 
There is an urgent need to implement feasible measures to resist HSBP and lessen 
the disparity of the global HSBP burden for older adults.

INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to (1) report long-term 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes among patients using rimegepant 
preventatively in BHV3000-305 (NCT03732638) open-label extension (OLE) and (2) 
map Migraine-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQv2) to 
EQ-5D-3L utility values over the double-blind treatment (DBT; 0-12 weeks) and 
the OLE (13-64 weeks) to assess the influence of treatment on these values.
METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis using data from a rimegepant study for the 
prevention of migraine (BHV3000-305). Adult patients with migraine took either 
rimegepant 75 mg or placebo every other day (EOD) during the DBT phase. All 
patients received rimegepant during the OLE. MSQv2 was measured at baseline, 
weeks 12, 24, and 64. A validated algorithm was used to map MSQv2 scores to 
EQ-5D utilities.
RESULTS: Baseline data were available for 347 patients treated with placebo and 
348 treated with rimegepant in the DBT period, who continued to the OLE. 
Baseline EQ-5D utilities were similar between trial arms: 0.598 for placebo and 
0.614 for rimegepant. EQ-5D improved from baseline to week 12 and utilities 
increased by + 0.09 for placebo and + 0.10 for rimegepant (p value = 0.011). By 
24 weeks, at which point patients who were originally randomized to placebo had 
received rimegepant 75 mg EOD for 12 weeks, HRQoL measures (MSQv2 and EQ-5D) 
were similar across groups, demonstrating rapid onset of treatment effect. This 
HRQoL improvement was durable out to 64 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, treatment with rimegepant 75 mg was associated 
with greater improvement in EQ-5D utilities during the 12-week DBT phase. 
Patients originally randomized to placebo experienced a similar improvement in 
EQ-5D utilities after switching to rimegepant during the OLE, demonstrating that 
benefits are realized within 12 weeks of active treatment. This preventive 
effect was durable out to 64 weeks and was associated with an additional 
increase in HRQoL over time.

The main aim of the study was to determine the impact of diagnostic activity and 
life expectancy on the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. We used a 
state transition simulation model based on Swedish population-based data to 
simulate life trajectories for 2,000,000 men from age 40 to 100 in order to 
estimate the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. Risk estimates were 
determined by the level of diagnostic activity and estimated life expectancy. 
Higher exposure to diagnostic activity resulted in more prostate cancer 
diagnoses. This was especially true for men diagnosed with low or intermediate 
grade disease. Men exposed to high diagnostic compared to low diagnostic 
activity had a five-fold increased lifetime risk (22% vs. 5%) of being diagnosed 
with a low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer and half the risk of being 
diagnosed with a high-risk prostate cancer (6% vs. 13%). Men with a long life 
expectancy had a higher lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis both 
overall (21% vs. 15%) and in all risk categories when compared to men with a 
short life expectancy. The lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis is 
strongly influenced by diagnostic activity and to a lesser degree by life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) is increasing all over the world, and relying 
on LE alone is no longer sufficient to identify whether a country is having a 
healthier population. Examining the increase in LE in relation to health - 
health expectancy estimation - is advised to ascertain the increase (or 
decrease) in LE without disability over time. This study examines the trends in 
health expectancy at age 60 in Bangladesh from 1996 to 2016.
METHODS: Mortality information from United Nations and World Health Organization 
and morbidity information from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics were combined 
using the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: With an overall declining trend over the study period and a big drop in 
disability rates during 2012-2013, the disability rates were observed 1.6-1.7% 
in 2016. The declining trend in disability may have two-fold implications: (1) 
among the 98.3% older adults (≥60 years) with no severe/extreme disability, 
those were in jobs could have continued their work if there was no mandatory 
retirement at age 59, and (2) the 1.7% (translates into 0.2 million in 2020) 
older adults with severe/extreme disability require care assistance with their 
daily activities. The observed gain in disability-free life expectancy, the 
decrease in life expectancy with disability and its proportion allude to the 
compression of morbidity and healthier older adults over time.
CONCLUSION: In 2020, Bangladesh had 13.2 million (i.e., 8% of the total 
population) older adults, which is increasing day by day. The policy makers and 
government are suggested to prioritize the issues of older adults, particularly 
disability, care needs, retirement age, and health in the light of the current 
study's findings. Utilizing health expectancy research is suggested to 
understand the combined effect of disability and mortality for considering 
policy changes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Menstrual abnormalities and shortened reproductive 
lifespan are associated with shorter life expectancy and higher cardiovascular 
and osteoporosis risk in the general population, although the magnitude of these 
reproductive factor irregularities in females with CKD is unclear. This 
systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current knowledge 
regarding menstrual abnormalities and reproductive lifespan among females with 
CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A comprehensive bibliographic 
search (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature [CINAHL]) was completed from database inception to February 2022 to 
identify all original articles reporting on females of reproductive age with 
nondialysis-dependent/nonkidney transplant CKD, dialysis-dependent CKD, or 
kidney transplantation and menstruation patterns, age of menarche, and/or 
menopause. Data extraction and study quality assessment were completed in 
duplicate. Random effects meta-analyses were used to derive pooled proportions 
estimates.
RESULTS: Forty-six studies were identified, and 35 were meta-analyzed, 
stratified by KRT modality and reported outcome. Menstrual abnormalities were 
present in 19%-47% of patients on hemodialysis and 75% of patients on peritoneal 
dialysis. Kidney transplantation was associated with a 7%-30% decrease in 
menstrual abnormalities. Reproductive lifespan was 32 years (95% confidence 
interval, 30 to 34 years). Although significant heterogeneity was present, study 
quality ranged from fair to good, and no evidence of publication bias was noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Menstrual abnormalities and shorter reproductive lifespan are 
common in females with CKD, although kidney transplantation may improve 
menstrual health.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has significantly improved the 
life expectancy for patients with refractory or relapse B cell lymphoma. As for 
B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), although the primary response rate 
is promising, the high incidence of early relapse has caused modest long-term 
survival with CAR-T cell alone. One of the main challenges is the limited 
persistence of CAR-T cells. To further optimize the clinical effects of CAR-T 
cells, many studies have focused on modifying the CAR structure and regulating 
CAR-T cell differentiation. In this review, we focus on CAR-T cell persistence 
and summarize the latest progress and strategies adopted during the in vitro 
culture stage to optimize CAR-T immunotherapy by improving long-term 
persistence. Such strategies include choosing a suitable cell source, improving 
culture conditions, combining CAR-T cells with conventional drugs, and applying 
genetic manipulations, all of which may improve the survival of patients with 
hematologic malignancies by reducing the probability of recurrence after CAR-T 
cell infusion and provide clues for solid tumor CAR-T cell therapy development.

Intelligence Scale and Satisfaction With Life Scale in the Indian Hospitality 
Industry.

BACKGROUND: Organizations today require employees who are well at managing 
emotional intelligence and using their emotions in a constructive process. The 
present study considered the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and Wong and 
Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) for the study. WLEIS has four factors: 
self-emotional appraisal (SEA), other's emotional appraisal (OEA), regulation of 
emotion (ROE), and use of emotions (UOE). These scales help to manage emotions 
that result in satisfaction with life.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to validate WLEIS and SWLS because this 
scale has been validated across many countries but very few studies have been 
conducted in the Indian context. Apart from that, the current study also 
incorporated SWLS to validate constructs and measurement models.
METHODS: A sample of 238 participants working in the hospitality industry have 
been considered for the study. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory 
factor analysis were used to validate all the constructs and measurement models.
RESULTS: The three factors of WLEIS and SWLS showed Cronbach's α more than 0.8 
that showed excellent internal consistency except for SEA. The results of 
exploratory factor analysis found that eigenvalue ranged from 2.8 to 5.9, and 
the total variance explained by constructs was 65.9%. Confirmatory factor 
analysis showed average variance explained of each construct to be 0.5, and 
composite reliability to be more than 0.7, which shows excellent construct 
validity of scales in the Indian hospitality sector. The study also validates 
measurement research model of WLEIS and SWLS on the basis of model fit index 
(chi-square/df = 4.83, RMSEA = 0.10, GFI = 0.94, and CFI = 0.90).
CONCLUSION: The strong validity and reliability of the WLEIS and SWLS have 
proved that neuroscience can apply these scales to measure emotional 
intelligence in order to understand others' emotions and apply emotions in a 
constructive process that may lead to satisfaction with life.

of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.

CONTEXT: The internalizing of experience of stigma among patients with substance 
use disorders (SUDs) can be debilitating to recovery. Individual factors such as 
self-regulation and abstinence self-efficacy can impact confidence in recovery 
and hope for future.
AIMS: The aim of the study was to explore relationship among self-stigma, 
self-regulation, self-efficacy, optimism, and confidence in recovery of patients 
with early-onset SUDs.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was carried out on a sample of 40 male patients 
with SUDs. The study had a single group exploratory design.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Self-Regulation Questionnaire, Drug Taking Confidence 
Questionnaire, Substance Abuse Self Stigma Scale, Revised Generalized Expectancy 
of Success (GES), and visual analog scale for craving were the measures used in 
the study.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pearson and spearman's correlation coefficient were used 
to test associations between the variables. Multiple regression models were 
drawn to examine predictors of generalized expectancy of success and confidence 
in recovery.
RESULTS: Self-regulation, generalized expectancy of success (optimism), and 
confidence in recovery were found to be significantly correlated with 
self-stigma dimensions. The multiple regression model revealed self-regulation 
and self-devaluation as significant predictors of optimism (GES), whereas 
abstinence self-efficacy and values disengagement dimension of self-stigma 
predicted patients' confidence in recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor regulatory capacities along with internalized feelings of 
shame, guilt, and devaluation may lead to lower levels of optimism and poorer 
expectancies of success from future. Patient's self-efficacy in terms of 
abstaining from use behaviors and disengagement from pursuing life goals can 
lead to lower levels of confidence in recovery from SUDs and have implications 
for treatment seeking.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures. Visceral fat is 
associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is inadequate knowledge on 
the relationship between osteoporosis and visceral fat. The study aimed to 
evaluate the relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and visceral fat 
mass in the elderly.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Subjects were enrolled from the 
Rheumatology Clinic. All subjects underwent baseline bone mineral density and 
body composition measurements using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS: A total of 321 patients including 288 females and 33 males were 
enrolled in this study. We followed up DEXA for 1 year for fat and muscle mass 
change and found that 162 (50.5%) had a decrease in fat mass, 129 (40.2%) had 
decreased visceral fat, and 138 (43%) had decreased muscle mass. Furthermore, we 
found that the baseline hip T score was correlated with visceral fat decrease. 
Using visceral fat decrease as the outcome, we found that hip T score could 
predict visceral fat loss: the higher the T score, the more visceral fat loss 
was found [p < 0.001, OR: 1.6, CI: (1.3-2.1)].
CONCLUSION: A high hip T score was associated with a future decrease in visceral 
fat, which may decrease the risk of atherosclerosis and CV risk. Therefore, 
evaluation of visceral fat may be useful for assessing CVD risk in patients with 
osteoporosis. Effective management of the risk of atherosclerosis and CVD is 
important in improving the life expectancy of these patients.

Ewing's sarcoma is a primary malignant bone tumor affecting individuals in the 
second decade of life. Primary sarcomas of the spine are rare and the occurrence 
of primary Ewing's sarcoma in the spine is very rare. There are 2 types of 
Ewing's sarcoma of the spine, Ewing's sarcoma of the sacral spine which is very 
aggressive with a poor prognosis and Ewing's sarcoma of the non-sacral spine 
which is an extremely rare occurrence. The patient may have a neurological 
deficit when the tumor extends into the spinal canal, causing compression of the 
spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive in diagnosing 
the tumor and Evaluation of the extent of the tumor. Here, we report the case of 
a 12-year-old boy who presented with low back pain, weakness of both lower limbs 
and bilateral spastic paraplegia progressively evolving since 1 month. The CT 
and MRI scans showed the presence of a tissue lesion process centered on the 
vertebral body of L1, heterogeneously enhanced after injection of Gadolinium 
respecting the posterior arch, without bulging of the posterior wall with 
epiduritis, endocanal extension and spinal cord compression. The patient 
underwent decompression with surgical biopsy and posterior stabilization of the 
spine. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the diagnosis 
of Ewing's sarcoma and the patient was referred to an oncopediatric center for 
combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but died at home a few days later before 
the start of treatment.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The advantage of tenecteplase (TNK) over alteplase (ALT) in 
managing acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has been reported, but the 
cost-effectiveness of these two strategies has not received as much attention. 
The objective of this study was to compare TNK and ALT for the management of AIS 
patients in Iran in terms of cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: This study was carried out from the payer's perspective in Iran, with a 
lifetime horizon. A full economic evaluation model was designed as a decision 
tree and a Markov model. After defining different Markov states, each health 
state was assigned a utility value, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was 
estimated using that value. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
ultimately used for evaluating the comparative cost-effectiveness. Both 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out.
RESULTS: Compared to ALT, TNK can save approximately 4333.81 USD, and is able to 
increase one unit of QALY while saving approximately 17,450.29 USD. So, 
Base-case results showed that TNK strongly dominates ALT. Moreover, the base 
case results were strongly confirmed by deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Base-case and sensitivity analysis showed that TNK is the dominant 
strategy compared to ALT for the management of AIS patients.

BACKGROUND: Management of high blood pressure (BP) typically requires adherence 
to medication regimes. However, it is known that the COVID-19 pandemic both 
interrupted access to some routine prescriptions and changed some patient health 
behaviours.
AIM: This study, therefore, retrospectively investigated prescription 
reimbursement of cardiovascular (CVD) medicines as a proxy measure for patient 
adherence and access to medicines during the pandemic.
METHODS: A cohort study of all primary care patients in England prescribed CVD 
medicines. The exposure was to the global pandemic. Prescriptions were compared 
before and after the pandemic's onset. Statistical variation was the outcome of 
interest.
RESULTS: Descriptive statistics show changes to monthly prescriptions, with wide 
confidence intervals indicating varying underlying practice. Analysis of 
variance reveals statistically significant differences for bendroflumethiazide, 
potassium-sparing diuretics, nicorandil, ezetimibe, ivabradine, ranolazine, 
colesevelam and midodrine. After the pandemic began (March-October 2020), 
negative parameters are observed for ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium 
channel blockers, statins, antiplatelet, antithrombotics, ARBs, loop diuretics, 
doxazosin, bendroflumethiazide, nitrates and indapamide, indicating decelerating 
monthly prescription items (statistically significant declines of calcium 
channel blockers, antithrombotic, adrenoreceptor blockers and diuretics) of CVD 
medicines within the general population. Many data points are not statistically 
significant, but fluctuations remain clinically important for the large 
population of patients taking these medications.
CONCLUSION: A concerning decline in uptake of CVD therapies for chronic heart 
disease was observed. Accessible screening and treatment alongside financial 
relief on prescription levies are needed. A video abstract is (4 min 51 s)
