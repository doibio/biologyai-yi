INTRODUCTION: Comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three 
first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) would improve patients' 
clinical benefits and save costs. Using real-world data, this study attempted to 
directly compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of first-line 
afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.
METHODS: During May 2011-December 2017, all patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) visiting a tertiary center were invited to fill out the EuroQol 
five-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaires and World Health Organization Quality of 
Life, brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), and received follow-ups for survival and 
direct medical costs. A total of 379 patients with EGFR mutation-positive 
advanced NSCLC under first-line TKIs were enrolled for analysis. After 
propensity score matching for the patients receiving afatinib (n = 48), 
erlotinib (n = 48), and gefitinib (n = 96), we conducted the study from the 
payers' perspective with a lifelong time horizon.
RESULTS: Patients receiving afatinib had the worst lifetime psychometric scores, 
whereas the differences in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) were modest. 
Considering 3 treatments together, afatinib was dominated by erlotinib. 
Erlotinib had an incremental cost-effectiveness of US$17,960/life year and 
US$12,782/QALY compared with gefitinib. Acceptability curves showed that 
erlotinib had 58.6% and 78.9% probabilities of being cost-effective given a 
threshold of 1 Taiwanese per capita GDP per life year and QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Erlotinib appeared to be cost-effective. Lifetime psychometric 
scores may provide additional information for effectiveness evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Since stroke survivors are increasingly responsible for managing 
stroke-related changes in their own health and lifestyle, self-management skills 
are required. In a recent randomised controlled trial a self-management 
intervention based on proactive coping action planning (SMI) in comparison with 
an education-based intervention (EDU) in stroke patients was investigated. 
However, no relevant treatment effects on the Utrecht Proactive Coping 
Competence scale (UPCC) and the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation 
Participation (USER-Participation) were found. The current study is a 
trial-based economic evaluation from a societal perspective comparing the same 
interventions (SMI versus EDU).
METHODS: UPCC, USER-Participation and EuroQol (EQ-5D-3 L) and costs were 
measured at baseline, three, six and twelve months after treatment. For the 
cost-effectiveness analyses, incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated for UPCC and USER-Participation. For the cost-utility analyses the 
incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) was expressed in cost per Quality Adjusted 
Life Years (QALYs). Outcomes were tested by means of AN(C)OVA analyses and costs 
differences by means of bootstrapping. Bootstrapping, sensitivity analyses and a 
subgroup analysis were performed to test the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: One hundred thirteen stroke patients were included in this study. The 
mean differences in USER-Participation scores (95%CI:-13.08,-1.61, 
p-value = .013) were significant different between the two groups, this does not 
account for UPCC scores (95%CI:-.267, .113, p-value = not significant) and QALYs 
(p-value = not significant) at 12 months. The average total societal costs were 
not significantly different (95%CI:€-3380,€7099) for SMI (€17,333) in comparison 
with EDU (€15,520). Cost-effectiveness analyses showed a mean ICER of 26,514 for 
the UPCC and 346 for the USER-Participation. Cost-utility analysis resulted in 
an ICUR of €44,688 per QALY. Assuming a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 
€50,000 per QALY, the probability that SMI will be cost-effective is 52%. 
Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analysis showed the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSIONS: SMI is probably not a cost-effective alternative in comparison with 
EDU. Based on the current results, the value of implementing SMI for a stroke 
population is debatable. We recommend further exploration of the potential 
cost-effectiveness of stroke-specific self-management interventions focusing on 
different underlying mechanisms and using different control treatments.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder mainly in middle-elderly population, which represents diverse nonmotor 
symptoms (NMS) besides such well-documented motor symptoms as bradykinesia, 
resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. With the advancement of 
aging trend worldwide, the global prevalence of PD is mounting up year after 
year. Nowadays, accumulating lines of studies have given a comprehensive and 
thorough coverage of motor symptoms in PD. Yet much less attention as compared 
has been paid to the nonmotor symptoms of PD, such as cognition deficits. Of 
note, a patient with PD who suffers from cognitive impairment may harbour a 
statistically significantly higher risk of progressing toward dementia, which 
negatively affects their life expectancy and daily functioning and overall 
lowers the global quality of life. Furthermore, it is a widely held view that 
cognitive dysfunction does not just occur in the late stage of PD. On the basis 
of numerous studies, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a harbinger of dementia 
in PD, which is observed as an intermediate state with considerable variability; 
some patients remain stable and some even revert to normal cognition. Considered 
that the timing, profile, and rate of cognitive impairment vary greatly among PD 
individuals, it is extremely urgent for researchers and clinicians alike to 
identify and predict future cognitive decline in this population. 
Simultaneously, early screening and canonical management of PD with cognitive 
deficits are very imperative to postpone the disease progression and improve the 
prognosis of patients. In our review, we focus on a description of cognitive 
decline in PD, expound emphatically the pathological mechanisms underlying 
cognition deficits in PD, then give a comprehensive overview of specific 
therapeutic strategies, and finally dissect what fresh insights may bring new 
exciting prospect for the subfield.

Climate change has shifted geographical ranges of species northwards or to 
higher altitudes on elevational gradients. These changes have been associated 
with increases in ambient temperatures. For ectotherms in seasonal environments, 
however, life history theory relies largely on the length of summer, which 
varies somewhat independently of ambient temperature per se. Extension of summer 
reduces seasonal time constraints and enables species to establish in new areas 
as a result of over-wintering stage reaching in due time. The reduction of time 
constraints is also predicted to prolong organisms' breeding season when 
reproductive potential is under selection. We studied temporal change in the 
summer length and its effect on species' performance by combining long-term data 
on the occurrence and abundance of nocturnal moths with weather conditions in a 
boreal location at Värriötunturi fell in NE Finland. We found that summers have 
lengthened on average 5 days per decade from the late 1970s, profoundly due to 
increasing delays in the onset of winters. Moth abundance increased with 
increasing season length a year before. Most of the species occurrences expanded 
upwards in elevation. Moth communities in low elevation pine heath forest and 
middle elevation mountain birch forest have become inseparable. Yet, the flight 
periods have remained unchanged, probably due to unpredictable variation in 
proximate conditions (weather) that hinders life histories from selection. We 
conclude that climate change-driven changes in the season length have potential 
to affect species' ranges and affect the structure of insect assemblages, which 
may contribute to alteration of ecosystem-level processes.

Polymers and scaffolds are the most significant tools in regenerative medicine. 
Urogenital disorders are an important group of diseases that greatly affect the 
patient's life expectancy and quality. Reconstruction of urogenital defects is 
one of the current challenges in regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine, 
as well as tissue engineering, may offer suitable approaches, while the tools 
needed are appropriate materials and cells. Autologous urothelial cells obtained 
from biopsy, bone marrow-derived stem cells, adipose stem cells and 
urine-derived stem cells that expressed mesenchymal cell markers are the cells 
that mainly used. In addition, two main types of biomaterials mainly exist; 
synthetic polymers and composite scaffolds that are biodegradable polymers with 
controllable properties and naturally derived biomaterials such as extracellular 
matrix components and acellular tissue matrices. In this review, we present and 
evaluate the most appropriate and suitable scaffolds (naturally derived and 
synthetic polymers) and cells applied in urogenital reconstruction.

Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner, is a cosmopolitan polyphagous pest 
of many crops. Habrobracon hebetor Say and Helicoverpa armigera 
nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) are two important biocontrol agents used to 
manage this pest, sometimes in combination. We evaluated the sublethal effects 
of HearNPV on H. hebetor life table parameters under laboratory conditions when 
its host (second instar H. armigera) was treated with HearNPV, and tested H. 
hebetor females for their ability to discriminate against inoculated hosts. 
Emergence of adults reared as solitary larvae was reduced by half on 
LC30-inoculated larvae compared to controls, but not on LC5 or LC15-inoculated 
hosts. Low concentrations (LC5, LC15, and LC30) of HearNPV had no effects on 
overall parasitoid developmental time, but longevity and lifetime fecundity was 
reduced for females emerging from hosts receiving the LC30 treatment. Net 
reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (rm), and finite rate of 
increase (λ) were all decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the LC15 
and LC30 treatments, as were female life expectancy, age-specific survivorship 
(lx), and age-specific fecundity (mx), whereas population doubling time (DT) 
increased. Parasitoids did not discriminate against LC15-inoculated larvae in 
choice or no-choice tests, but parasitized more LC50-inoculated hosts than 
controls in the choice test, with no significant differences in total numbers of 
eggs laid in either case. Although parasitoids suffered some loss of fitness in 
HearNPV-inoculated hosts under these laboratory conditions, these agents still 
appear compatible for joint application against H. armigera under field 
conditions, provided parasitoid releases are made 2 d after NPV application.

BACKGROUND: Hospital-based intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment has been 
the standard treatment mode for patients with primary immunodeficiency disease 
(PID). With the newer home-based subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) becoming 
approved for use in most countries, the question arises as to whether SCIg is a 
cost-effective treatment mode compared to IVIg in Australia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort simulation model with six 
health states: PID without infection, PID with infection treated at home or 
hospital, bronchiectasis without infection, bronchiectasis with infection 
treated at home or hospital, bronchiectasis with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infection, and death, from an Australian healthcare system perspective. A 
10-year time horizon with weekly cycles was chosen, and the expected costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the two treatment options estimated.
RESULTS: The cumulative 10-year cost per patient was 297,547 Australian dollars 
(A$) with IVIg and A$ 251,713 for SCIg. IVIg resulted in 5.55 QALYs and SCIg 
5.57 QALYs. Thus, SCIg appears to be a cost-saving option and possibly improves 
QALY from the Australian healthcare system perspective (i.e., the dominant 
treatment option). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the SCIg 
option is preferred in 93.2% of simulations given willingness to pay of A$ 
50,000 per QALY gained.
DISCUSSION: The results suggest that home-based SCIg is a cost-effective 
treatment option for patients with PID in Queensland, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Adequate access to healthcare is associated with lower risks of 
mortality at older ages. However, it is largely unknown how many more years of 
life can be attributed to having adequate access to healthcare compared with 
having inadequate access to healthcare.
METHOD: A nationwide longitudinal survey of 27,794 older adults aged 65+ in 
mainland China from 2002 to 2014 was used for analysis. Multivariate hazard 
models and life table techniques were used to estimate differences in life 
expectancy associated with self-reported access to healthcare (adequate vs. 
inadequate). The findings were assessed after adjusting for a wide range of 
demographic factors, socioeconomic status, family/social support, health 
practices, and health conditions.
RESULTS: At age 65, adequate access to healthcare increased life expectancy by 
approximately 2.0-2.5 years in men and women and across urban-rural areas 
compared with those who reported inadequate access to healthcare. At age 85, the 
corresponding increase in life expectancy was 1.0-1.2 years. After adjustment 
for multiple confounding factors, the increase in life expectancy was reduced to 
approximately 1.1-1.5 years at age 65 and 0.6-0.8 years at age 85. In women, the 
net increase in life expectancy attributable to adequate access to healthcare 
was 6 and 8% at ages 65 and 85, respectively. In men, the net increases in life 
expectancy were generally greater (10 and 14%) and consistent after covariate 
adjustments. In contrast, the increase in life expectancy was slightly lower in 
rural areas (2.0 years at age 65 and 1.0 years at age 85) than in urban areas 
(2.1 years at age 65 and 1.1 years age 85) when no confounding factors were 
taken into account. However, the increase in life expectancy was greater in 
rural areas (1.0 years at age 65 and 0.6 years at age 85) than in urban areas 
(0.4 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at age 85) after accounting for socioeconomic 
and other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Adequate access to healthcare was associated with longer life 
expectancy among older adults in China. These findings have important 
implications for efforts to improve access to healthcare among older populations 
in China.

The use of digitally collected patient-reported outcome measures for newly 
operated patients with total knee and hip replacements to improve post-treatment 
recovery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: The number of total knee replacements (TKRs) and total hip 
replacements (THRs) has been increasing noticeably in high-income countries, 
such as Germany. In particular, the number of revisions is expected to rise 
because of higher life expectancy and procedures performed on younger patients, 
impacting the budgets of health-care systems. Quality transparency is the basis 
of holistic patient pathway optimization. Nevertheless, a nation-wide 
cross-sectoral assessment of quality from a patient perspective does not yet 
exist. Several studies have shown that the use of patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROMs) is effective for measuring quality and monitoring 
post-treatment recovery. For the first time in Germany, we test whether early 
detection of critical recovery paths using PROMs after TKR/THR improves the 
quality of care in a cost-effective way and can be recommended for 
implementation into standard care.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a two-arm multi-center patient-level randomized 
controlled trial. Patients from nine hospitals are included in the study. 
Patient-centered questionnaires are employed to regularly measure digitized 
PROMs of TKR/THR patients from the time of hospital admission until 12 months 
post-discharge. An expert consortium has defined PROM alert thresholds at 1, 3, 
and 6 months to signal critical recovery paths after TKR/THR. An algorithm 
alerts study assistants if patients are not recovering in line with expected 
recovery paths. The study assistants contact patients and their physicians to 
investigate and, if needed, adjust the post-treatment protocol. When sickness 
funds' claims data are added, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention can be 
analyzed.
DISCUSSION: The study is expected to deliver an important contribution to test 
PROMs as an intervention tool and examine the determinants of high-quality 
endoprosthetic care. Depending on a positive and cost-effective impact, the goal 
is to transfer the study design into standard care. During the trial design 
phase, several insights have been discovered, and there were opportunities for 
efficient digital monitoring limited by existing legacy care models. 
Digitalization in hospital processes and the implementation of digital tools 
still represent challenges for hospital personnel and patients. Furthermore, 
data privacy regulations and the separation between the in- and outpatient 
sector are roadblocks to effectively monitor and assess quality along the full 
patient pathway.

INTRODUCTION: Due to an increase in life expectancy, onco-pulmonologists and 
thoracic surgeons are more frequently faced with octogenarian patients with lung 
cancer. In this age group, treatment modalities may need to be revised because 
of the increasing presence of comorbidities. Surgery remains the reference 
treatment for early stage disease, but mortality rates and postoperative 
complications are higher in this group of patients. One of the solutions to 
reduce the operative risk would be to develop videoassisted thoracoscopic 
pulmonary resection surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results 
of this form of lung cancer surgery in octogenarians.
METHODS: All patients 80 years old or more who underwent videoassisted lung 
cancer surgery from 2014 to 2018 at Lyon University Hospital were included. 
Wedge resections and diagnostic procedures were excluded.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (13 men, 6 women) were included. The median age was 
82 years old. All patients had undergone videoassisted lobectomy. Three patients 
required conversion to thoracotomy (15.8%). All patients underwent complete 
resection (R0). One patient had N1 lymph node involvement, all others were N0. 
The postoperative complication rate was 68.4%, the majority of which were grade 
II of the Clavien classification. Perioperative mortality was 5.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Videoassisted lung cancer resection in a selected population of 
octogenarians is associated with satisfactory short-term results. It is 
reasonable to favour minimally invasive techniques in this population, even if 
the proof of their superiority has not yet been firmly established.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to analyze the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of stress 
electrocardiogram (ES) and stress myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) 
according to coronary revascularization (CR) therapy, cardiac events (CE) and 
total mortality (TM).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 8,496 consecutive patients who underwent 
SPECT-MPI were followed-up (mean 5.3±3.5years). Cost-effectiveness for coronary 
bypass (CABG) or percutaneous CR (PCR) (45.6%/54.4%) according to combined 
electrocardiographic ischemia and scintigraphic ischemia were evaluated. 
Effectiveness was evaluated as TM, CE, life-year saved observed (LYSO) and 
CE-LYSO; costs analyses were conducted from the perspective of the health care 
payer. A sensitivity analysis was performed considering current CABG/PCR ratios 
(12%/88%).
RESULTS: When electrocardiogram and SPECT approaches are combined, the 
cost-effectiveness values for CABG ranged between 112,589€ (electrocardiographic 
and scintigraphic ischemia) and 2,814,715€ (without ischemia)/event avoided, 
38,664 and 2,221,559€/LYSO; for PCR ranged between 18,824€ (electrocardiographic 
and scintigraphic ischemia) and 46,377€ (without ischemia)/event avoided, 6,464 
and 36,604€/LYSO. To CE: the cost-effectiveness values of the CABG and CPR in 
presence of electrocardiographic and scintigraphic ischemia were 
269,904€/CE-avoided and 24,428€/CE-avoided, respectively; and the €/LYSO of the 
CABG and PCR were 152,488 and 13,801, respectively. The RCE was maintained for 
the current proportion of revascularized patients (12%/88%).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined ES and SPECT-MPI results, allows differentiation between 
patient groups, where the PCR and CABG are more cost-effective in different 
economic frameworks. The major CER in relation to CR, CE and TM occurs in 
patients with electrocardiographic and scintigraphic ischemia. PCR is more 
cost-effective than CABG.

Life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) continues to 
increase dramatically over the last few decades, primarily due to significant 
medical and surgical advancements in the field. Adult congenital heart disease 
(ACHD) patients are now living longer but continue to face morbidity and reduced 
long-term survival when compared to the general population. We briefly describe 
the growth of ACHD with a focus on surgical procedures and outcomes in the more 
complex lesions including Tetralogy of Fallot, Ebsteins Anomaly of the tricuspid 
valve, Coarctation of the Aorta, Transposition of the Great Arteries and single 
ventricle lesions. The advancing role of mechanical circulatory support and 
cardiac transplantation in ACHD patients is also highlighted. Cardiac surgery in 
these patients continues to improve with low surgical mortality rate and 
outstanding long-term outcomes and efficacy.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved dynamic process and present in variety 
of cells at basal levels to maintain homeostasis and to promote cell survival in 
response to stresses. The early bone loss with excessive glucocorticoids (GCs) 
was reported to be related with the extension of the life span of osteoclasts. 
However, the connection between GCs induced bone loss and osteoclast autophagy 
remains to be elucidated. Autophagy was detected in a Dexamethasone (Dex) 
induced osteoporotic mice model and primary osteoclast cultures by autophagosome 
detection kit, and autophagy-related proteins were assayed by Western blotting 
and Immunostaining. The bone morphology was examined by micro-CT and TRAP 
staining. The trabecular bone micro-architecture was deteriorated, and the 
osteoclast number and spread area were increased in the Dex-treated mice 
compared with the control group (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, autophagy in 
pre-osteoclasts was increased in mice under Dex administration evidenced by the 
increased number of autophagosome and up-regulation of autophagy-related protein 
levels. Further, the enhanced autophagy under Dex treatment was verified in 
primary cultured osteoclasts, as shown by the increased levels of Beclin 1 and 
LC3-II/LC3-I and the autophagy complex formation members including Atg1, Atg13, 
and Atg7. However, the expressions of PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR in primary cultured 
osteoclasts were inhibited under Dex induced autophagy. Using the selective PTEN 
inhibitor SF1670 to activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway reversed this osteoclast 
autophagy under Dex treatment. Our study suggests that osteoclast autophagy was 
enhanced in glucocorticoids induced bone loss, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling 
pathway mediated the increased autophagy in primary cultured osteoclasts under 
glucocorticoids treatment.

In the last decades, Candida albicans has served as the leading causal agent of 
life-threatening invasive infections with mortality rates approaching 40% 
despite treatment. Candida albicans (C. albicans) exists in three biological 
phases: yeast, pseudohyphae, and hyphae. Hyphae, which represent an important 
phase in the disease process, can cause tissue damage by invading mucosal 
epithelial cells then leading to blood infection. In this review, we summarized 
recent results from different ﬁelds of fungal cell biology that are instrumental 
in understanding hyphal growth. This includes research on the differences among 
C. albicans phases; the regulatory mechanism of hyphal growth, extension, and 
maintaining cutting-edge polarity; cross regulations of hyphal development and 
the virulence factors that cause serious infection. With a better understanding 
of the mechanism on mycelium formation, this review provides a theoretical basis 
for the identification of targets in candidiasis treatment. It also gives some 
reference to the study of antifungal drugs.

Brodalumab, an interleukin-17 receptor A inhibitor, demonstrated rapid and 
robust efficacy with a favorable safety profile in patients with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis. Here, we present data from a multicenter, open-label 
extension study in patients with plaque psoriasis with/without psoriatic 
arthritis who completed 64 weeks of treatment with brodalumab (140 or 210 mg, 
every 2 weeks [Q2W]). Patients were enrolled to evaluate the long-term safety 
and efficacy of a modified dose of brodalumab. Eligible patients were switched 
to a reduced dose of brodalumab (140 mg every 4 weeks on day 1) in the extension 
study; the dose and dosing interval were modified sequentially at the 
physician's discretion (minimum 140 mg every 8 weeks and maximum 210 mg Q2W) 
until drug approval, after which all patients were switched to 210 mg Q2W for 
postmarketing surveillance. Of the 129 patients enrolled, 107 (82.9%) completed 
the 108-week or more extension study. All patients had psoriasis that was well 
controlled with brodalumab treatment on day 1. Improvement in psoriasis-related 
symptoms, evaluated with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, Psoriasis Scalp 
Severity Index, Dermatology Life Quality Index, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index, 
and American College of Rheumatology 20, 50 and 70, was maintained during the 
108-week extension study. Brodalumab treatment was well tolerated throughout, 
and no new safety signals were identified. The most commonly reported 
treatment-related adverse event was nasopharyngitis, followed by influenza and 
oral candidiasis. No cases of serious candida infection or Crohn's disease were 
observed in this study. Serious treatment-related adverse events, such as 
appendicitis, brain abscess, bacterial meningitis, colon cancer, immunoglobulin 
A nephropathy and tubulointerstitial nephritis, were reported in one patient 
each. No anti-brodalumab-binding antibodies or brodalumab-neutralizing 
antibodies were detected in any patient throughout the extension study. Overall, 
the long-term efficacy and safety of brodalumab were demonstrated over 
108 weeks.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The low measles vaccination coverage contributes to the 
re-emerging of measles in Italy. This study aimed to estimate the measles 
burden, expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), in Umbria, for the 
period 2013-2018.
METHODS: Data on measles cases in Umbria were obtained from the MoRoNet. While 
data related to the resident population, were obtained from the website of the 
National Institute of Statistics. The estimated DALYs was calculated using the 
Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe toolkit. The results are expressed in 
DALYs per year, per case and per 100,000 subjects, for acute illness and for 
sequelae.
RESULTS: The estimated incidence in mean for the entire period was 52.50 cases 
per year. Resulting in an average loss of 3.10 DALYs per year.
CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained from this analysis provide important information 
on the impact of measles in the Umbria region, and offer useful data to the 
Health Authorities that can be used to reduce measles incidence in the region.

It is an ugly fact that a significant amount of the world's population will 
contract SARS-CoV-II infection with the current spreading. While a specific 
treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management 
strategies are crucial. The individual preventive and protective measures drive 
the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-contracted hosts, 
their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, 
sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the 
personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, 
mild, moderate, to death. The careful individual assessment for the possible 
dietary, nutritional, medical, lifestyle, and environmental risks, together with 
the proper relevant risk management strategies, is the sensible way to deal with 
the pandemic of SARS-CoV-II.

Because of a recent increase in survival rates and life expectancy of patients 
with congenital heart disease (CHD), radiologists are facing new challenges when 
imaging the peculiar anatomy of individuals with repaired CHD. Cardiac computed 
tomography and magnetic resonance are paramount noninvasive imaging tools that 
are useful in assessing patients with repaired CHD, and both techniques are 
increasingly performed in centers where CHD is not the main specialization. This 
review provides general radiologists with insight into the main issues of 
imaging patients with repaired CHD, and the most common findings and 
complications of each individual pathology and its repair.

OBJECTIVE: Low-risk non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) has 
been treated with single agent chemotherapy, but second curettage is emerging as 
an alternative strategy with reported cure rates of 40%. We sought to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of second curettage as the first line treatment of 
low-risk GTN.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created using TreeAge software to compare 
costs and outcomes for women with WHO staged low-risk GTN undergoing treatment 
with 5-day methotrexate (MTX), biweekly pulsed actinomycin-D, or second 
curettage. Probabilities were derived from the literature. Outcomes of interest 
included side effects from chemotherapy, need for additional agents, hemorrhage, 
uterine perforation, and cure rates. Utilities were applied to discounted life 
expectancy at a rate of 3% to generate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Sensitivity analyses were then performed in order to assess the robustness of 
our assumptions.
RESULTS: Of the three treatment arms, MTX was associated with the lowest cost 
and had similar QALYs to the other studied modalities. Second curettage was 
associated with 49 additional cures when applied to a theoretic cohort of 1000 
women, as well as an additional 83 hemorrhages and 17 uterine perforations. 
Sensitivity analysis on the cure rate of second curettage revealed that second 
curettage was not cost-effective over MTX unless its probability of cure was 
98%.
CONCLUSION: Our study found 5-day MTX was the cost-effective strategy for 
treatment of women with low-risk, non-metastatic GTN when compared to second 
curettage and actinomycin-D. In a carefully selected patient population, second 
curettage may be an additional treatment strategy.

Widening income inequalities in life expectancy? Analysing time trends based on 
German health insurance data.

BACKGROUND: While social disparities in mortality have been shown in the 
majority of high-income countries, research on inequalities in the German 
population is still limited. This applies especially to studies investigating 
time trends in social inequalities with respect to life expectancy. The aim of 
this study is to examine income inequalities in life expectancy and whether 
inequalities have narrowed or widened over time.
METHODS: The analyses are based on the claims data of a large German health 
insurance provider, which facilitates the combining of information on individual 
income and mortality. Life expectancy is calculated separately for three income 
groups (<60%, 60% to 80% and ≥80% of the average income in Germany) and for sex 
by applying period life table analyses. Trends are assessed by comparing the 
time periods 2005-2008 (N = 1 773 122), 2009-2012 (N=1 792 735) and 2013-2016 
(N = 1 987 114).
RESULTS: Trends in life expectancy differed by sex, age and income group. 
Especially among elderly men, the gap between low- and high-income groups 
widened over time, disadvantaging men with low incomes. Among women, a slight 
reduction in inequalities was observed, which was driven by the increases in 
life expectancy in low-income groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that not all population subgroups benefitted equally 
from the continuing rise in life expectancy. The persisting inequalities 
emphasise the importance of public health efforts concentrating on reducing 
mortality risks among individuals in lower socioeconomic positions. Special 
attention should be paid to elderly men with low incomes. Further research is 
needed on the mechanisms underlying increasing health inequalities over time.
