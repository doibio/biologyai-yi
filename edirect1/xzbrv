OBJECTIVE: The objective was twofold: (1) to estimate for each individual the 
body mass index (BMI) which is associated with the lowest risk of death, and (2) 
to study variants of the BMI formula to determine which gives the best 
predictions of death.
METHODS: Treating BMI = mass/height(2) as a continuous variable and estimating 
its interaction effects with several other variables, this study analyzed the 
NIH-AARP study data set of approximately 566,000 individuals and fit Cox 
proportional hazards models to the survival times.
RESULTS: For each individual, a "personalized optimal BMI," the BMI for that 
individual which, according to the model, is associated with the lowest risk of 
death, is estimated. The average personalized optimal BMI is approximately 26, 
which is in the current "overweight" category. In fact, mass/height is a better 
predictor of death on the data set than BMI itself.
CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests that an individual's "optimal" BMI depends on 
his or her features; "one-size-fits-all" recommendations may be not best.

BACKGROUND: New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective for 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. However, their prices have been widely 
debated. Decision-analytic models can project the long-term value of HCV 
treatment. Therefore, understanding of the methods used in these models and how 
they could influence results is important.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe and systematically review the 
methodological approaches in published cost-effectiveness models of chronic HCV 
treatment with DAAs.
DATA SOURCES: We searched several electronic databases, including Medline, 
Embase and EconLit, from 2011 to 2015.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY: Study selection was performed by two reviewers independently. 
We included any cost-effectiveness analysis comparing DAAs with the old standard 
of care for HCV treatment. We excluded non-English-language studies and studies 
not reporting quality-adjusted life-years.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHOD: One reviewer collected data and assessed 
the quality of reporting, using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement. Another reviewer crosschecked the 
abstracted information. The development methods of the included studies were 
synthetized on the basis of good modelling practice recommendations.
RESULTS: Review of 304 citations revealed 36 cost-effectiveness analyses. The 
reporting quality scores of most articles were rated as acceptable, between 67 
and 100 %. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (50 %), followed 
by the USA (44 %). Fifty-six percent of the 36 studies evaluated the cost 
effectiveness of HCV treatment in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced 
patients, 97 % included genotype 1 patients and 53 % evaluated the cost 
effectiveness of second-generation or oral DAAs in comparison with the previous 
standard of care or other DAAs. Twenty-one models defined health states in terms 
of METAVIR fibrosis scores. Only one study used a discrete-event simulation 
approach, and the remainder used state-transition models. The time horizons 
varied; however, 89 % of studies used a lifetime horizon. One study was 
conducted from a societal perspective. Thirty-three percent of studies did not 
conduct any model validation. We also noted that none of the studies modelled 
HCV treatment as a prevention strategy, 86 % of models did not consider the 
possibility of re-infection with HCV after successful treatment, 97 % of studies 
did not consider indirect economic benefits resulting from HCV treatment and 
none of the studies evaluating oral DAAs used real-world data.
LIMITATIONS: The search was limited by date (from 1 January 2011 to 8 September 
2015) and was also limited to English-language and published reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Most modelling studies used a similar modelling structure and could 
have underestimated the value of HCV treatment. Future modelling efforts should 
consider the benefits of HCV treatment in preventing transmission, extra-hepatic 
and indirect economic benefits of HCV treatment, real-world cost-effectiveness 
analysis and cost effectiveness of HCV treatment in low- and middle-income 
countries.

Dual Trajectories of Gang Affiliation and Delinquent Peer Association During 
Adolescence: An Examination of Long-Term Offending Outcomes.

Prior research has demonstrated that both adolescent gang affiliation and 
perceived delinquent peer association are important predictors of individual 
offending. A crucial question is whether and how youth gang affiliation 
contributes to a spectrum of criminal acts above and beyond the influence of 
associating with delinquent peers. Using 14 waves of data from the Rochester 
Youth Developmental Study, an ongoing longitudinal panel study aimed at 
understanding the causes and consequences of delinquency and drug use in an 
urban sample of adolescents, the current study employs a relatively new modeling 
technique-dual trajectory analysis-to illustrate the dynamic relationship 
between these two measures among 666 male youth. The results suggest that the 
two measures, while overlapping, may constitute distinct concepts that operate 
in different ways. The most convincing evidence of gang effects, above and 
beyond the influence of perceived peer delinquency, is for violent behavior and 
by extension police arrest. Our findings contribute to developmental research 
and provide information that informs future gang control efforts.

The life expectancy of people living with mental illness is significantly 
shorter than that of the rest of the population. Despite the profound impact of 
physical health issues on both quality of life and life expectancy, the 
perspectives of mental health consumers have yet to be thoroughly explored. 
Furthermore, research has focused far more on describing barriers than on 
identifying solutions. This paper reports on findings from a qualitative 
exploratory research study, with the aim to examine the potential role of a 
specialist nurse with advanced physical health-care skills. Focus groups were 
conducted with 31 consumers. Data were analysed thematically. The concept of a 
role like this was supported; however, participants stressed: (i) the importance 
of integration between health professionals and various components of the 
health-care system; and (ii) the need for culture change for nurses to work from 
a less medically-dominated approach. Previous research literature suggests that 
a nursing position dedicated to physical health care and coordination might 
produce positive outcomes for mental health consumers. The findings from the 
current research project emphasize the need for consumers to be identified as 
key stakeholders in a solution-focused approach to improved physical health care 
for mental health consumers.

Understanding subjective longevity expectations is important, but measurement is 
not straightforward. Two common elicitation formats are the direct measurement 
of a subjective point estimate of life expectancy and the assessment of survival 
probabilities to a range of target ages. This study presents one of the few 
direct comparisons of these two methods. Results from a representative sample of 
the Dutch population indicate that respondents on average gave higher estimates 
of longevity using survival probabilities (83.6 years) compared to point 
estimates (80.2 years). Individual differences between elicitation methods were 
smaller for younger respondents and for respondents with a higher socioeconomic 
status. The correlation between the subjective longevity estimations was 
moderate, but their associations with respondents' characteristics were similar. 
Our results are in line with existing literature and suggest that findings from 
both elicitation methods may not be directly comparable, especially in certain 
subgroups of the population. Implications of inconsistent and focal point 
answers, rounding and anchoring require further attention. More research on the 
measurement of subjective expectations is required.

[FRENCH CYSTIC FIBROSIS EPIDEMIOLOGY AFTER A DECADE OF NEONATAL SCREENING].

[Article in French]

Durieu I.

Since its description in 1938, the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients 
has increased from a few months to nearly 50 years in most Western countries. 
This significant improvement was related to new symptomatic treatments, for 
nutritional and respiratory cares in specialized multidisciplinary teams. 
Systematic neonatal screening for the disease avoides the diagnostic delays that 
have very deleterious impact on the prognosis of the disease. It allows early 
optimal management; their nutritional benefit has been demonstrated. The French 
registry of cystic fibrosis shows that adult patients outnumber children. The 
median age of death remains under thirty years and the prognosis is very closely 
linked to the progression chronic respiratory insufficiency. About one hundred 
patients were annually treated by lung transplant

[FUTURE THERAPIES FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS].

[Article in French]

Fajac I.

Current cystic fibrosis treatment is symptomatic and has greatly increased life 
expectancy over the last decades. However, mean age of death is still 
29-years-old. Innovative therapeutic molecules aiming at restoring CFTR function 
are developed. Ivacaftor is the first medicine approved in 2012 for the 3% of 
patients worldwide carrying the rare CFTR mutation called G5510. Ivacafter is 
associated with a sustained improvement in respiratory function and a decreased 
frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. Other pharmacotherapies are being 
developed that aim at correcting other CFTR defects due to other CFTR mutations, 
especially the most frequent F508del mutation.

A cost-effectiveness model for the use of a cannabis-derived oromucosal spray 
for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Severity of spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS) directly 
correlates with the level and cost of care required. This study assessed whether 
a tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) oromucosal spray for treatment of 
moderate-severe MS spasticity is a cost-effective use of healthcare resources in 
Wales.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare THC/CBD plus standard of care 
(SoC) treatments with SoC alone.
RESULTS: At 30 years, total incremental cost for THC/CBD plus SoC treatment was 
estimated at £3,836/patient (ICER: £10,891/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). 
Hospital admission costs had the greatest effect on the base case ICER. 
Inclusion of carer cost led to incremental cost of -£33,609/patient (ICER: 
-£95,423/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: The THC/CBD spray was found to be cost-effective for the treatment 
of spasticity in MS, and dominant, if home carer costs were included. Use of 
THC/CBD has the potential to generate cost savings by significantly improving 
the symptoms of moderate to severe MS spasticity.

Mechanism of Action of Spinal Mobilizations: A Systematic Review.

Author information:
(1)*Faculty of Medicine & Odontology, Department of Physiology, University of 
the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain †Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's 
College London, London, United Kingdom.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence regarding the mechanism of action of 
mobilizations.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal mobilizations-low velocity passive 
oscillatory movements-reduce spinal pain in some patient subgroups. Identifying 
patients likely to respond remains a challenge since mobilizations' mechanism(s) 
of action are unclear.
METHODS: Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Embase, and Scopus databases were 
searched for relevant studies. Reference lists of included studies were hand 
searched. Studies were included if the intervention was passive spinal 
mobilizations, participants were symptomatic, and outcomes evaluated possible 
mechanisms of action. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two 
assessors using a modified Cochrane Back Review Group tool.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included in the review. Four were classified 
high risk, 14 moderate risk, and four low risk of bias. Commonest methodological 
limitations were lack of participant blinding, adequate randomization and 
allocation concealment, and sample size calculation. Evidence suggests that 
spinal mobilizations cause neurophysiological effects resulting in hypoalgesia 
(local and/or distal to mobilization site), sympathoexcitation, and improved 
muscle function. Mobilizations have no effect on temperature pain threshold. 
Three of four studies reported reduction in spinal stiffness, heterogeneous in 
location and timing. There is limited evidence (one study in each case) to 
suggest that mobilizations produce increased nociceptive flexion reflex 
threshold, improved posture, decreased concentration of substance P in saliva, 
and improved sway index measured in cervical extension. Evidence does not 
support an effect on segmental vertebral movement. Two studies investigated 
correlations between hypoalgesia and mechanism: one found a correlation with 
sympathoexcitatory changes, whereas the other found no correlation with change 
in stiffness.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest involvement of an endogenous pain inhibition 
system mediated by the central nervous system, although this is yet to be 
investigated directly. There is limited evidence regarding other possible 
mechanisms.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

Productivity changes in OECD healthcare systems: bias-corrected Malmquist 
productivity approach.

Carolina, USA.

This study evaluates productivity changes in the healthcare systems of 30 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the 
2002-2012 periods. The bootstrapped Malmquist approach is used to estimate 
bias-corrected indices of healthcare performance in productivity, efficiency and 
technology by modifying the original distance functions. Two inputs (health 
expenditure and school life expectancy) and two outputs (life expectancy at 
birth and infant mortality rate) are used to calculate productivity growth. 
There are no perceptible trends in productivity changes over the 2002-2012 
periods, but positive productivity improvement has been noticed for most OECD 
countries. The result also informs considerable variations in annual 
productivity scores across the countries. Average annual productivity growth is 
evenly yielded by efficiency and technical changes, but both changes run 
somewhat differently across the years. The results of this study assert that 
policy reforms in OECD countries have improved productivity growth in healthcare 
systems over the past decade. Countries that lag behind in productivity growth 
should benchmark peer countries' practices to increase performance by 
prioritizing an achievable trajectory based on socioeconomic conditions. For 
example, relatively inefficient countries in this study indicate higher income 
inequality, corresponding to inequality and health outcomes studies. Although 
income inequality and globalization are not direct measures to estimate 
healthcare productivity in this study, these issues could be latent factors to 
explain cross-country healthcare productivity for future research. Copyright ©

Moral expansiveness: Examining variability in the extension of the moral world.

The nature of our moral judgments-and the extent to which we treat others with 
care-depend in part on the distinctions we make between entities deemed worthy 
or unworthy of moral consideration-our moral boundaries. Philosophers, 
historians, and social scientists have noted that people's moral boundaries have 
expanded over the last few centuries, but the notion of moral expansiveness has 
received limited empirical attention in psychology. This research explores 
variations in the size of individuals' moral boundaries using the psychological 
construct of moral expansiveness and introduces the Moral Expansiveness Scale 
(MES), designed to capture this variation. Across 6 studies, we established the 
reliability, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the MES. Moral 
expansiveness was related (but not reducible) to existing moral constructs 
(moral foundations, moral identity, "moral" universalism values), predictors of 
moral standing (moral patiency and warmth), and other constructs associated with 
concern for others (empathy, identification with humanity, connectedness to 
nature, and social responsibility). Importantly, the MES uniquely predicted 
willingness to engage in prosocial intentions and behaviors at personal cost 
independently of these established constructs. Specifically, the MES uniquely 
predicted willingness to prioritize humanitarian and environmental concerns over 
personal and national self-interest, willingness to sacrifice one's life to save 
others (ranging from human out-groups to animals and plants), and volunteering 
behavior. Results demonstrate that moral expansiveness is a distinct and 
important factor in understanding moral judgments and their consequences.

BACKGROUND: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a recently developed treatment for 
patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. A few studies have suggested the 
clinical efficacy of this intervention. However, no study has evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of BT compared to other alternative treatments for 
moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, which currently include omalizumab and 
standard therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of standard therapy, BT, and 
omalizumab for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma in the USA.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model with weekly cycles was developed to 
reflect the course of asthma progression over a 5-year time horizon. The study 
population was adults with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma whose asthma 
remained uncontrolled despite using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS, with 
or without long-acting beta-agonists [LABA]). A perspective of the health-care 
system was adopted with asthma-related costs as well as quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and exacerbations as the outcomes.
RESULTS: For standard therapy, BT, and omalizumab, the discounted 5-year costs 
and QALYs were $15,400 and 3.08, $28,100 and 3.24, and $117,000 and 3.26, 
respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BT versus 
standard therapy and omalizumab versus BT was $78,700/QALY and $3.86 
million/QALY, respectively. At the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $50,000/QALY and 
$100,000/QALY, the probability of BT being cost-effective was 9%, and 67%, 
respectively. The corresponding expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was 
$155 and $1,530 per individual at these thresholds. In sensitivity analyses, 
increasing the costs of BT from $14,900 to $30,000 increased its ICER relative 
to standard therapy to $178,000/QALY, and decreased the ICER of omalizumab 
relative to BT to $3.06 million/QALY. Reducing the costs of omalizumab by 25% 
decreased its ICER relative to BT by 29%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, our study suggests that there is 
more than 60% chance that BT becomes cost-effective relative to omalizumab and 
standard therapy at the WTP of $100,000/QALY in patients with moderate-to-severe 
allergic asthma. However, there is a substantial uncertainty in the underlying 
evidence, indicating the need for future research towards reducing such 
uncertainty.

infectious diseases in the older adults is under discussion in different 
countries. When considering the added value of such preventive measures, insight 
into the current disease burden will assist in prioritization. The aim of this 
study was derive the first estimates of the disease burden in adults aged 50 
years or over in the Netherlands for influenza, pertussis, pneumococcal disease 
and herpes zoster.
METHODS: The average annual disease burden for these four diseases in the 
Netherlands was calculated for the period 2010-2013 using the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) measure. Disease models and parameters 
were obtained from previous research. Where possible we adapted these models 
specifically for older adults and applied age-specific parameters derived from 
literature. The disease burden based on these adapted models and parameters was 
compared with the disease burden based on the general population models.
RESULTS: The estimated average annual disease burden was from high to low: 
pneumococcal disease (37,223 DALYs/year), influenza (7941 DALYs/year), herpes 
zoster (942 DALYs/year), and pertussis (812 DALYs/year). The adaptation of 
models and parameters specifically for the elderly resulted in a higher disease 
burden compared to the use of general population models.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, the disease burden in the period 2010-2013 was 
highest for pneumococcal disease, mostly because of high mortality, followed by 
influenza. Disease burden of herpes zoster and pertussis was relatively low and 
consisted mostly of years lived with disability. Better information on the 
course of infectious diseases and long-term consequences would enable more 
accurate estimation of disease burden in older adults.

The elevated expression of bombesin receptors in many of the deadliest cancers 
has attracted special interest in developing bombesin-directed agents for tumor 
imaging and therapy. Previously, we constructed the chimeric peptide BB28 by 
fusing bombesin to a mitochondria-disrupting peptide. BB28 selectively induced 
the apoptosis of various tumor cells in vitro and showed promising in vivo 
antitumor effects. In general, a short circulating half-life limits the in vivo 
effect of peptides. To prolong the half-life of BB28, here, we generated the 
novel peptide ABB28 by fusing an albumin-binding domain (ABD) to the N-terminus 
of BB28. ABB28 exhibited much higher binding affinity for albumin than BB28, and 
this modification extended the peptide half-life from several minutes to 2 h. 
Optical imaging revealed that ABB28 accumulated in xenografted tumors within 1h 
post-injection and persisted at an evident level for up to 24 h. ABB28 exerted 
stronger tumor-suppressive effects than BB28. Significant differences in the 
tumor volumes (P<0.001) and the tumor weights (P=0.002) were observed between 
ABB28- and BB28-treated mice. Moreover, ABB28 exhibited tumor suppression 
comparable to that of PEGylated 5K-BB28 in vivo. These results suggest that 
half-life extension via ABD fusion represents a useful strategy for optimizing 
bombesin-directed pharmaceuticals for cancer-targeted therapy.

[Kidney aging: a predictable and partly avoidable fragility].

[Article in French]

Laville M, Rognant N.

The 9th World Kidney Day, on 13 March 2014, was devoted to the topic of renal 
aging. The proportion of older people in the general population is increasing 
steadily worldwide, with the most rapid growth in developing countries. This 
demographic upheaval is a consequence of socioeconomic development and 
increasing life expectancy. Chronic kidney disease is an important public health 
problem characterized by poor health outcomes and very high healthcare costs. 
Chronic kidney disease is a major risk multiplier in patients with diabetes, 
hypertension, heart disease and stroke, all of which are key causes of death and 
disability among older people. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is 
higher in the elderly, in whom it contributes to the effects of aging. The 
decrease in renal function with age also compounds the effects of renal disease, 
whether primary or secondary to systemic or urinary tract disorders. This 
physiological reduction in functional capacity affects the glomerular filtration 
rate and renal tubular functions, including water and salt regulation and also 
the elimination of many drugs. The aging kidney is much more sensitive to toxic 
insults, especially those due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and 
iodinated contrast agents. Prevention of renal deterioration in the elderly is 
based on monitoring renal function, adapting medications, and maintaining a 
regular supply of water and salt.

Health Sciences, Pomona, CA, USA (QAL) qle@westernu.edu.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of structural uncertainty of Markov models in 
modeling cost-effectiveness for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (ABC).
METHODS: Four common Markov models for ABC were identified and examined. Markov 
models 1 and 2 have 4 health states (stable-disease, responding-to-therapy, 
disease-progressing, and death), and Markov models 3 and 4 only have 3 health 
states (stable-disease, disease-progressing, and death). In models 1 and 3, the 
possibility of death can occur in any health state, while in models 2 and 4, the 
chance of dying can only occur in the disease-progressing health state. A 
simulation was conducted to examine the impact of using different model 
structures on cost-effectiveness results in the context of a combination therapy 
of lapatinib and capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive ABC. Model 
averaging with an assumption of equal weights in all 4 models was used to 
account for structural uncertainty.
RESULTS: Markov model 3 yielded the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $303,909 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), while Markov model 1 
produced the highest ICER ($495,800/QALY). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$150,000/QALY, the probabilities that the combination therapy is considered to 
be cost-effective for Markov models 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 14.5%, 14.1%, 21.6%, and 
17.0%, respectively. When using model averaging to synthesize different model 
structures, the resulting ICER was $389,270/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that modeling ABC with different Markov model 
structures yielded a wide range of cost-effectiveness results, suggesting the 
need to investigate structural uncertainty in health economic evaluation. When 
applied in the context of HER2-positive ABC treatment, the combination therapy 
with lapatinib is not cost-effective, regardless of which model was used and 
whether uncertainties were accounted for.

BACKGROUND: A common approach to obtain health state valuations is the 
time-tradeoff (TTO) method. Much remains unknown regarding the influence of 
responder characteristics on TTO answers. The objective of this study is to 
increase understanding of the influence that beliefs regarding future health and 
death, as well as desires to witness certain life events, have on respondents' 
health state valuations.
METHODS: An online survey was designed, including three TTO questions using a 10 
year timeframe. Moreover, respondents completed demographic questions, the 
Health-Risk Attitude Scale (HRAS), the Expectations Regarding Aging (ERA) 
questionnaire, questions about beliefs regarding future health (i.e. life 
expectancy) and death (i.e. fear of death, belief in life after death and 
opinion about euthanasia), and about important life events taking place within 
the TTO timeframe. Regression analyses were performed in order to assess the 
influence of these different variables.
RESULTS: One thousand sixty-seven respondents were included in the analyses. The 
following variables were significantly associated with years traded off: ERA 
mental health (decrease), ERA physical health (increase), HRAS (increase), 
support for euthanasia (increase), fear of death (decrease) and consideration of 
an important life event (decrease). The explained variance of the final model 
was low (0.08).
CONCLUSION: TTO responses may be influenced by considerations of future health, 
including life events and attitudes regarding health risks and death. Further 
investigation of TTO responses remains warranted.

Service,Madrid,Spain.

BACKGROUND: Studies on depression and mortality in nursing homes have shown 
inconclusive findings, and none has studied the role of detection. We sought to 
measure the association of depression with long-term all-cause mortality in 
institutionalised older people and evaluate a potential modification in the 
association by its detection status.
METHODS: We selected a stratified cluster sample of 591 residents aged 75 years 
or older (mean age 84.5 years) living in residential and nursing homes of 
Madrid, Spain, who were free of severe cognitive impairment at the 1998-1999 
baseline interview. Mortality was ascertained until age 105 years or September 
2013 (median/maximum follow-up 4.8/15.2 years) through linkage to the Spanish 
National Death Index. Detected depression was defined at baseline as a 
physician's diagnosis or antidepressant use, undetected depression as 
significant depressive symptoms (score of 4 or higher on the ten-item version of 
the Geriatric Depression Scale) without documented diagnosis or treatment, and 
no depression as the absence of diagnosis, treatment, and symptoms. Constant and 
age-dependent hazard ratios for mortality comparing detected and undetected 
depression with no depression were estimated using Cox models, and absolute 
years of life gained and lost using Weibull models.
RESULTS: The baseline prevalences of detected and undetected depression were 
25.9 and 18.8%, respectively. A total of 499 participants died during 3575 
person-years of follow-up. In models adjusted for age, sex, type of facility, 
number of chronic conditions, and functional dependency, overall depression was 
not associated with long-term all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.70-1.08). However, compared with no depression, 
detected depression showed lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI: 
0.46-0.86), while undetected depression registered higher, not statistically 
significant, mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI: 0.98-1.86). The median life 
expectancy increased by 1.8 years (95% CI: -3.1 to 6.7 years) in residents with 
detected depression and decreased by 6.3 years (95% CI: 2.6-10.1 years) in those 
undetected. Results were more marked in women than men and they were robust to 
the exclusion of antidepressants from the definition of depression and also to 
the use of a stricter cut-off for the presence of depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term mortality risk associated with depression in nursing 
homes depends on its detection status, with better prognosis in residents with 
detected depression and worse in those undetected. The absolute impact of 
undetected depressive symptoms in terms of life expectancy can be prominent.

BACKGROUND: Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) shortens life expectancy by 
10-12 years, some patients survive extremely long durations of diabetes. The 
clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with >40 years T2DM remain unknown. 
Thus, the aim of the present study was to document the clinical profile of 
patients with T2DM for ≥40 years.
METHODS: The present study evaluated 157 survivors with >40 years T2DM from a 
total of 582 773 patients with T2DM enrolled in a Chinese national survey of 
HbA1c. Two matched case-control studies were performed on long T2DM survivors 
(cases) separately matched according to: (1) survey day, sex, and survey 
hospital; and (2) age, sex, and survey hospital. Conditional logistic regression 
analysis was performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for long survival.
RESULTS: Patients with a long duration of T2DM had a mean (± SD) age of 75 ± 10 
years. Their T2DM had been diagnosed at a mean age of 32 years and the median 
duration of diabetes was 41 years. In both case-control studies, long-duration 
T2DM was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia (OR 6.31; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.89-21.09) and coronary heart disease (CHD; OR 2.18 
95% CI 1.01-4.70). However, long-duration T2DM was not associated with a higher 
likelihood of abnormal lipids, diabetic nephropathy (DN), or stroke compared 
with patients with a shorter duration of T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that Chinese patients with long-term 
T2DM also had increased risks of hyperglycemia and non-fatal CHD. Further 
studies are needed to investigate whether survival of these patients was 
associated with non-increased risk of DN.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study evaluated the outcome following surgery for 
carotid artery stenosis in a single institution during a 10-year period and the 
relevance of aging to access to surgery.
METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2010, 649 carotid endarterectomies 
(CEAs) were performed in 596 patients for internal carotid artery occlusive 
disease at our institution; 596 patients received unilateral CEAs and 53 
patients received bilateral CEAs. Data regarding patient characteristics, 
comorbidities, stroke, mortality, restenosis, and other surgical complications 
were obtained from a review of medical records. Since elderly and high-risk 
patients comprise a significant proportion of the patient group undergoing CEAs, 
differences in comorbidity and mortality were evaluated according to age when 
the patients were divided into three age groups: <70 years, 70-79 years, and ≥80 
years.
RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 67.5 years, and 88% were men. 
Symptomatic carotid stenosis was observed in 65.7% of patients. The rate of 
perioperative stroke and death (within 30 days of the procedure) was 1.84%. The 
overall mortality rate was higher among patients in the 70-79 years and >80 
years age groups than among those in the <70 years age group, but there was no 
significant difference in stroke-related mortality among these three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: CEA over a 10-year period has yielded acceptable outcomes in terms 
of stroke and mortality. Therefore, since CEA is a safe and effective strategy, 
it can be performed in elderly patients with acceptable life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: All over the world, Indigenous populations have remarkably high 
rates of commercial tobacco use compared to non-Indigenous groups. The high 
rates of commercial tobacco use in Indigenous populations have led to a variety 
of health issues and lower life expectancy than the general population. The 
objectives of this systematic review were to investigate changes in the 
initiation, consumption and quit rates of commercial tobacco use as well as 
changes in knowledge, prevalence, community interest, and smoke-free 
environments in Indigenous populations. We also aimed to understand which 
interventions had broad reach, what the common elements that supported positive 
change were and how Aboriginal self-determination was reflected in program 
implementation.
METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications and grey 
literature selected from seven databases and 43 electronic sources. We included 
studies between 1994 and 2015 if they addressed an intervention (including 
provision of a health service or program, education or training programs) aimed 
to reduce the use of commercial tobacco use in Indigenous communities globally. 
Systematic cross-regional canvassing of informants in Canada and internationally 
with knowledge of Indigenous health and/or tobacco control provided further 
leads about commercial tobacco reduction interventions. We extracted data on 
program characteristics, study design and learnings including successes and 
challenges.
RESULTS: In the process of this review, we investigated 73 commercial tobacco 
control interventions in Indigenous communities globally. These interventions 
incorporated a myriad of activities to reduce, cease or protect Indigenous 
peoples from the harms of commercial tobacco use. Interventions were successful 
in producing positive changes in initiation, consumption and quit rates. 
Interventions also facilitated increases in the number of smoke-free 
environments, greater understandings of the harms of commercial tobacco use and 
a growing community interest in addressing the high rates of commercial tobacco 
use. Interventions were unable to produce any measured change in prevalence 
rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The extent of this research in Indigenous communities globally 
suggests a growing prioritization and readiness to address the high rates of 
commercial tobacco use through the use of both comprehensive and tailored 
interventions. A comprehensive approach that uses multiple activities, the 
centring of Aboriginal leadership, long term community investments, and the 
provision of culturally appropriate health materials and activities appear to 
have an important influence in producing desired change.

AIM: The morbidity and mortality after a hip fracture in the elderly population 
are multifactorial. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term impact 
of specific factors to mortality rate and mobility after a hip fracture in the 
elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly suffering a hip fracture after a low-energy 
trauma was included in the study, whereas moribund patients with severe comorbid 
conditions and high-energy trauma were excluded. All the patients were treated
