biosynthesis and accumulation of 1,8-cineole, cypressene, limonene, and 
α-terpineol, Nitrospira and Alphaproteobacteria may play an inhibitory role. 
Finally, our results emphasized the critical role that soil pH and nitrogen 
levels play in driving rhizobacterial community structure, and specific 
functional bacteria can also counteract with soil properties, Acidibacter and 
Nitrospira can affect soil pH and nitrogen effectiveness. Overall, this study 
provides additional insight into the complex correlation of rhizosphere 
microorganisms with bioactive ingredients and soil properties of medicinal 
plants.

University Graz, Graz, Austria.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of all breast cancer cases show overexpression or 
amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) [Cancer 
Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2017;26(4):632-41]. With the introduction of 
trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pertuzumab to the realm of treatment, a new era of 
antibody-drug conjugates had only begun. Within the last two decades, survival 
for patients with this tumor subtype has fundamentally improved.
SUMMARY: Beginning with a taxane plus trastuzumab/pertuzumab followed by 
trastuzumab deruxtecan, the first- and second-line treatments are set in stone. 
With the introduction of tucatinib as a newer tyrosine kinase inhibitor in 
combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab, there is one efficient line of 
treatment available after trastuzumab deruxtecan or even earlier in selected 
cases with active brain metastasis. Especially for later stages of disease, 
several combination strategies are under investigation. There is still a lack of 
positive results on immune checkpoint inhibition combined with Her2-targeted 
therapy, but hopefully an extension to the treatment algorithm will be on its 
way soon.
KEY MESSAGES: With the HER2CLIMB trial, patients with brain metastasis were no 
longer excluded from bigger trials, and international guidelines implemented its 
presence or absence in their decision trees [N Engl J Med. 2020;382(7):597-609]. 
Curing Her2-positive metastatic breast cancer, or at least living a long life 
with this disease, is increasingly becoming a reality.

Staphylococcus haemolyticus is one of the most important nosocomial human 
pathogens frequently isolated in bloodstream and medical device-related 
infections. However, its mechanisms of evolution and adaptation are still poorly 
explored. To characterize the strategies of genetic and phenotypic diversity in 
S. haemolyticus, we analyzed an invasive strain for genetic and phenotypic 
stability after serial passage in vitro in the absence and presence of 
beta-lactam antibiotics. We performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of 
the culture and analyzed five colonies at seven time points during stability 
assays for beta-lactam susceptibility, hemolysis, mannitol fermentation, and 
biofilm production. We compared their whole genomes and performed phylogenetic 
analysis based on core single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We observed a 
high instability in the PFGE profiles at the different time points in the 
absence of antibiotic. Analysis of WGS data for individual colonies showed the 
occurrence of six large-scale genomic deletions within the oriC environ, smaller 
deletions in non-oriC environ regions, and nonsynonymous mutations in clinically 
relevant genes. The regions of deletion and point mutations included genes 
encoding amino acid and metal transporters, resistance to environmental stress 
and beta-lactams, virulence, mannitol fermentation, metabolic processes, and 
insertion sequence (IS) elements. Parallel variation was detected in clinically 
significant phenotypic traits such as mannitol fermentation, hemolysis, and 
biofilm formation. In the presence of oxacillin, PFGE profiles were overall 
stable over time and mainly corresponded to a single genomic variant. Our 
results suggest that S. haemolyticus populations are composed of subpopulations 
of genetic and phenotypic variants. The maintenance of subpopulations in 
different physiological states may be a strategy to adapt rapidly to stress 
situations imposed by the host, particularly in the hospital environment. 
IMPORTANCE The introduction of medical devices and antibiotics into clinical 
practice have substantially improved patient quality of life and contributed to 
extended life expectancy. One of its most cumbersome consequences was the 
emergence of medical device-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant 
and opportunistic bacteria such as Staphylococcus haemolyticus. However, the 
reason for this bacterium's success is still elusive. We found that in the 
absence of environmental stresses, S. haemolyticus can spontaneously produce 
subpopulations of genomic and phenotypic variants with deletions/mutations in 
clinically relevant genes. However, when exposed to selective pressures, such as 
the presence of antibiotics, a single genomic variant will be recruited and 
become dominant. We suggest that the maintenance of these cell subpopulations in 
different physiological states is an extremely effective strategy to adapt to 
stresses imposed by the host or the infection environment and might contribute 
for S. haemolyticus survival and persistence in the hospital.

Expectancy-value theory of motivation (EVT) suggests that student values 
influence their likelihood of putting in the effort required to learn, and these 
values can be shaped by student characteristics, such as their experiences, 
sociodemographics, and disciplinary norms. To understand the extent to which 
these characteristics relate to students' values, we surveyed 1162 graduating 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students across four 
universities using the previously developed and validated Survey of Teaching 
Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U). The STEP-U survey included 
Likert questions to capture students' values of 27 cross-disciplinary skills and 
the frequency with which they experienced 27 instructional methods thought to 
develop particular skills. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) showed an 
understandable factor structure for both students' perceived value of 
cross-disciplinary skills and frequency of classroom experiences. Using multiple 
regression, we identified differences in values that were associated with 
classroom experiences, STEM discipline, participation in undergraduate research, 
and student sociodemographics. Findings were generalizable across institutions 
and disciplines. The theoretical framework (EVT), the broad data collection 
(four institutions with multiple disciplines), and the type of data analyses 
(e.g., EFA) used provide theoretical, methodological, and practical 
contributions and suggest additional directions for future research.

PURPOSE: Polypharmacy is a significant problem in patients with incurable cancer 
and a method to optimize pharmacotherapy in this patient group is lacking. 
Therefore, a drug optimization tool was developed and tested in a pilot test.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of health professionals developed a "Tool to 
Optimize Pharmacotherapy in Patients with Incurable Cancer" (TOP-PIC) for 
patients with a limited life expectancy. The tool consists of five sequential 
steps to optimize medications, including medication history, screening for 
medication appropriateness and drug interactions, a benefit-risk assessment 
using the TOP-PIC Disease-based list, and shared decision-making with the 
patient. For pilot testing of the tool, 8 patient cases with polypharmacy were 
analyzed by 11 oncologists before and after training with the TOP-PIC tool.
RESULTS: TOP-PIC was considered helpful by all oncologists during the pilot 
test. The median additional time required to administer the tool was 2 min per 
patient (P < 0.001). For 17.4% of all medications, different decisions were made 
by using TOP-PIC. Among possible treatment decisions (discontinuation, 
reduction, increase, replacement, or addition of a drug), discontinuation of 
medications was the most common. Without TOP-PIC, physicians were uncertain in 
9.3% of medication changes, compared with only 4.8% after using TOP-PIC 
(P = 0.001). The TOP-PIC Disease-based list was considered helpful by 94.5% of 
oncologists.
CONCLUSIONS: TOP-PIC provides a detailed, disease-based benefit-risk assessment 
with recommendations specific for cancer patients with limited life expectancy. 
Based on the results of the pilot study, the tool seems practicable for 
day-to-day clinical decision-making and provides evidence-based facts to 
optimize pharmacotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The Second Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine 
recommended that cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) explicitly incorporate the 
valuation of productive time from a societal perspective. We developed a new 
approach to capture productivity impacts in CEA without direct evidence on these 
impacts by associating varying levels of health-related quality-of-life (HrQoL) 
score with different time uses in the United States.
METHODS: We conceptualized a framework that estimates the association between 
HrQoL score with productivity through time uses. We used the American Time-Use 
Survey (ATUS) from year 2012-2013, when data on a Well-Being Module (WBM) was 
additionally collected alongside ATUS. The WBM measured the quality of life 
(QoL) score using a visual analog scale. To operationalize our conceptual 
framework, we employed an econometric approach that addressed three technical 
issues in the observed data: (i) distinction between overall QoL and HrQoL, (ii) 
correlation across different categories of time use and the share structure of 
time-use data, and (iii) reverse causality between time uses and HrQoL score in 
a cross-sectional setting. Furthermore, we developed a metamodel-based algorithm 
to summarize the numerous estimates from the primary econometric model 
efficiently. Finally, we illustrated the use of our algorithm to calculate 
productivity and time spent seeking care costs in an empirical CEA of a prostate 
cancer treatment.
RESULTS: We provide the estimates of the metamodel algorithm. Incorporating 
these estimates into the empirical CEA reduced the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio by 27%.
CONCLUSION: Our estimates can facilitate the inclusion of productivity and time 
spent seeking care in CEA as recommended by the Second Panel.

Robots in Assisted Living Facilities: Scoping Review.

BACKGROUND: Various technological interventions have been proposed and studied 
to address the growing demand for care of residents in assisted living 
facilities, in which a preexisting shortage of professional caregivers has been 
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Care robots are one such intervention with 
the potential to improve both the care of older adults and the work life of 
their professional caregivers. However, concerns about efficacy, ethics, and 
best practices in the applications of robotic technologies in care settings 
remain.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to examine the literature on robots used in 
assisted living facilities and identify gaps in the literature to guide future 
research.
METHODS: On February 12, 2022, following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) 
protocol, we searched PubMed, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore 
digital library, and ACM Digital Library using predetermined search terms. 
Publications were included if they were written in English and focused on the 
use of robotics in assisted living facilities. Publications were excluded if 
they did not provide peer-reviewed empirical data, focused on user needs, or 
developed an instrument to study human-robot interaction. The study findings 
were then summarized, coded, and analyzed using the Patterns, Advances, Gaps, 
Evidence for practice, and Research recommendations framework.
RESULTS: The final sample included 73 publications from 69 unique studies on the 
use of robots in assisted living facilities. The findings of studies on older 
adults were mixed, with some studies suggesting positive impacts of robots, some 
expressing concerns about robots and barriers to their use, and others being 
inconclusive. Although many therapeutic benefits of care robots have been 
identified, methodological limitations have weakened the internal and external 
validity of the findings of these studies. Few studies (18/69, 26%) considered 
the context of care: most studies (48/69, 70%) collected data only on recipients 
of care, 15 studies collected data on staff, and 3 studies collected data on 
relatives or visitors. Theory-driven, longitudinal, and large sample size study 
designs were rare. Across the authors' disciplines, a lack of consistency in 
methodological quality and reporting makes it difficult to synthesize and assess 
research on care robotics.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study call for more systematic research on the 
feasibility and efficacy of robots in assisted living facilities. In particular, 
there is a dearth of research on how robots may change geriatric care and the 
work environment within assisted living facilities. To maximize the benefits and 
minimize the consequences for older adults and caregivers, future research will 
require interdisciplinary collaboration among health sciences, computer science, 
and engineering as well as agreement on methodological standards.

Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder. The proportion of elderly individuals at risk for AD 
and cardiovascular problems increases by raising life expectancy. The present 
study was designed to investigate the effect of the sacubitril/valsartan 
combination compared to that of valsartan alone in a rat model of AD. Methods: 
72 male adult Wistar rats were divided into seven groups; control untreated rats 
received saline, control valsartan-treated rats received valsartan orally, 
control sacubitril/valsartan treated rats received sacubitril/valsartan orally, 
model rats received aluminum chloride i.p., model valsartan treated rats 
received aluminum chloride i.p. and valsartan orally and model 
sacubitril/valsartan treated rats received aluminum chloride i.p. and 
sacubitril/valsartan combination orally. All previous treatments continued on a 
daily basis for 6 weeks. At the second, fourth, and sixth weeks of the 
experiment, behavioral changes were evaluated using the Morris water maze and 
novel object recognition tests, and systolic blood pressure was measured. In the 
end, rat brain malondialdehyde and amyloid-beta 1-42 levels were measured, and 
the isolated hippocampus was evaluated histopathologically. Results: Valsartan 
improved AD symptoms in the aluminum-induced rat model, while the 
sacubitril/valsartan combination significantly worsened all tested parameters in 
both control and model rats compared with untreated and valsartan-treated 
animals. Conclusion: Based on the current study's findings, valsartan did not 
increase the risk for AD development in control rats and improved AD symptoms in 
a rat model, while sacubitril/valsartan combination increased the risk of AD in 
control rats and worsened the condition in a rat model.

OBJECTIVES: Minimal important difference (MID), the smallest change or 
difference that patients perceive as important, aids interpretation of change in 
patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) scores. A credibility instrument that 
assesses the methodological rigor of an anchor-based MID includes one core item 
addressing the correlation between the PROM and the anchor. However, the 
majority of MID studies in the literature fail to report the correlation. To 
address this issue, we extended the anchor-based MID credibility instrument by 
adding an item addressing construct proximity as an alternative to the 
correlation item.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Informed by an MID methodological survey, we added an 
alternative item-a subjective assessment of similarity of the constructs (i.e., 
construct proximity) between PROM and anchor-to the correlation item and 
generated principles for the assessment. We sampled 101 MIDs and analyzed the 
assessments performed by each pair of raters. By calculating weighted Cohen's 
kappa, we assessed the reliability of the assessments.
RESULTS: Construct proximity assessment is based on the anticipated association 
between the anchor and PROM constructs: the closer the anticipated association, 
the higher the rating. Our detailed principles address the most frequently used 
anchors: transition ratings, measures of satisfaction, other PROMs, and clinical 
measures. The assessments showed acceptable agreement (weighted kappa 0.74, 95% 
CI 0.55-0.94) between raters.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a reported correlation coefficient, construct 
proximity assessment provides a useful alternative in the credibility assessment 
of anchor-based MID estimates.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a trend supporting endovascular 
revascularization (ER) in the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). 
However, few studies have compared the cost effectiveness of ER and open 
revascularization (OR) for this indication. The purpose of this study is to 
conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing open versus ER for CMI.
METHODS: We built a Markov model with Monte Carlo microsimulation using 
transition probabilities and utilities from existing literature for CMI patients 
undergoing OR versus ER. Costs were derived from the hospital perspective using 
the 2020 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The model randomized 20,000 patients 
to either OR or ER and allowed for 1 subsequent reintervention with 3 other 
intervening health states: alive, alive with complications, and dead. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) were analyzed over a 5-year period. One-way sensitivity and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to study the impact of 
parameter variability on cost effectiveness.
RESULTS: OR cost $4,532 for 1.03 QALYs while ER cost $5,092 for 1.21 QALYs, 
leading to an ICER of $3,037 per QALY gained in the ER arm. This ICER was less 
than our willingness to pay threshold of $100,000. Sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that our model was most sensitive to costs, mortality, and patency 
rates after OR and ER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated ER would 
be considered cost effective 99% of iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that while 5-year costs for ER were greater than 
OR, ER afforded greater QALYs than OR. Although ER is associated with lower 
long-term patency and higher rates of reintervention, it appears to be more cost 
effective than OR for the treatment of CMI.

Stroke is characterised by high mortality and disability rate in China. This 
study aimed to explore the temporal trends in years of life lost (YLL) and loss 
of life expectancy due to stroke and its subtypes in urban and rural areas in 
China during 2005-2020. Data were obtained from China National Mortality 
Surveillance System. Abbreviated life and stroke-eliminated life tables were 
generated to calculate loss of life expectancy. The YLL and loss of life 
expectancy due to stroke in urban and rural areas at both national and 
provincial level during 2005-2020 were estimated. In China, the age-standardised 
YLL rate due to stroke and its subtypes were higher in rural areas than in urban 
areas. The YLL rate due to stroke showed a downward trend in both urban and 
rural residents from 2005 to 2020, decreased by 39.9% and 21.5%, respectively. 
Loss of life expectancy caused by stroke decreased from 1.75 years to 1.70 years 
from 2005 to 2020. During which, loss of life expectancy due to intracerebral 
haemorrhage (ICH) decreased from 0.94 years to 0.65 years, while that of 
ischaemic stroke (IS) increased from 0.62 years to 0.86 years. A slightly upward 
trend was observed in loss of life expectancy caused by subarachnoid haemorrhage 
(SAH), from 0.05 years to 0.06 years. Loss of life expectancy due to ICH and SAH 
was always higher in rural areas than in urban areas, whereas that of IS was 
higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Rural males suffered the greatest 
loss of life expectancy due to ICH and SAH, while the highest loss of life 
expectancy caused by IS was found in urban females. Furthermore, Heilongjiang 
(2.25 years), Tibet (2.17 years) and Jilin (2.16 years) were found to have the 
highest loss of life expectancy caused by stroke in 2020. Loss of life 
expectancy caused by ICH and SAH was higher in western China, while the disease 
burden of IS was heavier in northeast China. Stroke remains a major public 
health problem in China, although the age-standardised YLL rate and loss of life 
expectancy due to stroke decreased. Evidence-based strategies should be 
conducted to reduce the premature death burden caused by stroke and prolong life 
expectancy in Chinese population.

Populations of the coati, Nasua nasua, like the populations of other wild 
animals, are regulated by several biotic or abiotic factors. For example, 
parasites act as a biotic factor affecting the dynamics and density of coati 
populations. The parasitic nematodes of coatis include Dirofilaria species, such 
as Dirofilaria immitis, Dirofilaria repens, and Dirofilaria incrassata. 
Considering that there are few records on parasitism by D. incrassata, including 
information on the life cycle or location in the host body, this study aimed to 
investigate the infection of N. nasua by D. incrassata in midwestern Brazil. 
Thus, two coatis (males and adults) from the Cerrado of Goiás, which died (cause 
unknown) at the Wild Animal Screening Center/IBAMA in the municipality of 
Goiânia, Goiás, Midwestern of Brazil, were dissected and all helminths found 
were collected, identified following specific keys and quantified. A total of 85 
specimens of D. incrassata were collected, with a mean parasitic intensity of 
42.5 and a parasitic amplitude ranging from 40 to 45, measuring 41-93 mm in 
length and 0.23-0.45 mm in width. All helminths were adults and were distributed 
in the superficial and deep fascia (at different levels) from the neck to the 
hind limb. Most helminths were tangled, with some encased in a connective tissue 
film. Most reported human heartworm cases refer to subcutaneous or ocular 
heartworm infection, mainly caused by D. repens, although other species of 
heartworm may be associated. D. incrassata was not reported as zoonotic agent, 
diferently of other Dirofilaria species associated with wild animals and with 
zoonotic potential in the Americas. This study reiterates N. nasua as the 
definitive host for D. incrassata and the subcutaneous tissue as the site of 
choice for this helminth in the adult form. In addition, it reports new body 
regions where the parasite occurs. This study is the first to document the 
occurrence of D. incrassata infestation in the State of Goiás, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the impact of social activity frequency 
on mid- and long-term overall survival in older Chinese people.
METHODS: The association between social activity frequency and overall survival 
was analysed in 28 563 subjects from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity 
Survey (CLHLS) cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 21 161 (74.1%) subjects died during the follow-up of 
132 558.6 person-years. Overall, more frequent social activity was associated 
with longer overall survival. From baseline to 5 years of follow-up, adjusted 
time ratios (TRs) for overall survival were 1.42 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.66, p<0.001) 
in the not monthly but sometimes group, 1.48 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.84, p=0.001) in 
the not weekly but at least once/month group, 2.10 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.69, 
p<0.001) in the not daily but at least once/week group, and 1.87 (95% CI 1.44 to 
2.42, p<0.001) in the almost everyday group versus never group. From 5 years to 
the end of follow-up, adjusted TRs for overall survival were 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 
to 1.50, p=0.766) in the not monthly but sometimes group, 1.64 (95% CI 1.01 to 
2.65, p=0.046) in the not weekly but at least once/month group, 1.23 (95% CI 
0.73 to 2.07, p=0.434) in the not daily but at least once/week group, and 3.04 
(95% CI 1.69 to 5.47, p<0.001) in the almost everyday group versus the never 
group. Stratified and sensitivity analysis revealed similar results.
CONCLUSION: Frequent participation in social activity was significantly 
associated with prolonged overall survival in older people. However, only 
participating in social activity almost every day could significantly prolong 
long-term survival.

Nowadays, thanks to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is transforming into a chronic disease. 
The life expectancy of people living with HIV (PWH) has increased, as well as 
their risk of developing several co-morbidities, in particular cardiovascular 
diseases. In addition, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 
increased in PWH with a 2 to 10 times higher incidence when compared to the 
general population. Over the last decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
have been widely used in the treatment and prevention of VTE and non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation. DOACs are characterized by a rapid onset of activity, a 
predictable response and a relatively wide therapeutic window. Nevertheless, 
drug interactions exist between HAART and DOACs, exposing PWH to a theoretically 
increased bleeding or thrombotic risk. DOACs are substrates of the transport 
protein P-glycoprotein and/or of isoforms of cytochromes P450 pathway, which can 
be affected by some antiretroviral drugs. Limited guidelines are available to 
assist physicians with the complexity of those drug-drug interactions. The aim 
of this paper is to provide an updated review on the evidence of the high risk 
of VTE in PWH and the place of DOAC therapy in this population.

BACKGROUND: With improved life expectancy following Fontan palliation, there is 
an increasing population of patients with a total cavopulmonary connection. 
However, there is a poor understanding of which patients will experience Fontan 
failure and when. 4D flow MRI has identified several metrics of clinical 
interest, but longitudinal studies investigating hemodynamics in Fontan patients 
are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between flow distribution to 
the pulmonary arteries and regional hemodynamic metrics in a unique cohort with 
follow-up 4D flow MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with > 6 months of 4D flow MRI follow-up were 
included. Flow distribution from the caval veins to pulmonary arteries was 
measured in addition to regional measures of peak velocity, viscous energy loss 
(ELmean and ELtot), and kinetic energy.
RESULTS: Ten patients with total cavopulmonary connection (17.7 ± 8.8 years at 
baseline, follow-up: 4.4 ± 2.6 years) were included. Five subjects had unequal 
flow distribution from the IVC to the pulmonary arteries at baseline. Over time, 
these subjects tended to have larger increases in peak velocity (39.2% vs 6.6%), 
ELmean (11.6% vs -38.3%), ELtot (9.5% vs -36.2%), and kinetic energy (96.1% vs 
36.3%) in the IVC. However, these differences were statistically insignificant. 
We found that changes in ELmean and ELtot were significantly associated with 
changes in peak velocity in the caval veins (R2 > 0.5, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Unequal flow distribution from the IVC may drive increasing peak 
velocities and viscous energy losses, which have been associated with worse 
clinical outcomes. Changes in peak velocity may serve as a surrogate measure for 
changes in viscous energy loss.

To provide an overview of the global, regional, and national incidence and 
mortality of neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections (NS) and their change 
trends from 1990 to 2019, based on the data from the 2019 Global Burden of 
Disease study. This was a retrospective demographic analysis based on aggregated 
data. Annual incident cases, deaths, age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and their percentage changes of NS during 
1990-2019 were collected from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study. Globally, 
the incident cases of NS increased by 12.79% (from 5.59 million in 1990 to 6.31 
million in 2019), and the deaths decreased by 12.93% (from 0.26 million in 1990 
to 0.23 million in 2019). In the globe, the ASIR of NS per 100,000 population 
increased by 14.35% (from 85.21 in 1990 to 97.43 in 2019), and the ASMR 
decreased by 11.91% (from 3.97 in 1990 to 3.5 in 2019).
CONCLUSION: Increasing trends in incidence and decreasing trends in mortality of 
NS were observed worldwide from 1990 to 2019. More robust epidemiological 
research and effective health strategies are urgently needed to reduce the 
disease burden of neonatal sepsis worldwide.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • Neonatal sepsis has significant impacts on neonatal health, but 
estimates on the global burden and trends of neonatal sepsis are scarce and 
existing findings vary considerably.
WHAT IS NEW: • Globally, there were 6.31 million incident cases of neonatal 
sepsis and 0.23 million deaths due to neonatal sepsis. • Increasing trends in 
incidence and decreasing trends in mortality of neonatal sepsis were observed 
worldwide from 1990 to 2019, with the highest absolute burden in sub-Saharan 
Africa and Asia.

BACKGROUND: Targeted rehabilitation within the acute inpatient setting could 
have a substantial impact on improving outcomes for major trauma patients. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the introduction 
of a purpose-built ward environment, and a new allied health model of care 
(AHMOC) delivered in the acute inpatient setting, in a major trauma population.
METHODS: The statewide trauma registry, the trauma center's data warehouse, and 
electronic medical record data were used for this observational study. There 
were three phases: baseline, new ward, and new AHMOC. Cost-effectiveness was 
measured as cost per quality-adjusted life year using preinjury, hospital 
discharge, 1-month and 6-month 5-level, EQ-5D utility scores. Total costs 
included initial acute and inpatient rehabilitation care, as well as outpatient, 
readmission and ED presentations to 6-months.
RESULTS: Four hundred eleven patients were included. Case-mix was stable between 
phases. The median (IQR) number of allied health services received by patients 
was 8 (5-17) at baseline, 10 (5-19) in the new ward phase, and 17 (9-23) in the 
AHMOC phase. The proportion discharged to rehabilitation was 37% at baseline, 
45% with the new ward and 28% with the new AHMOC. Mean (SD) total Australian 
dollar costs were $69,335 ($141,175) at baseline, $55,943 ($82,706) with the new 
ward and $37,833 ($49,004) with the AHMOC. The probability of the AHMOC being 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted 
life year was 99.4% compared with baseline and 98% compared with the new ward.
CONCLUSION: The new allied health model of care was found to be a cost-effective 
intervention. Uptake of this model of allied health care at other trauma centers 
has the potential to reduce the cost and burden of major trauma.

single-centre study to assess the impact of clinical judgement and patient 
preferences.

OBJECTIVE: The heterogeneity in the population of older patients with cancer 
makes clinical decision-making difficult. We investigated the agreement between 
the G8 score and clinical judgment in frailty assessments, determined the impact 
of a life-expectancy calculator, and explored patient and caregiver preferences 
towards the treatment goal.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years in need of new oncological treatment were 
prospectively enrolled between June 2020 and February 2021. Frailty was 
estimated by the oncologist and caregiver and compared to the G8 estimation. We 
examined whether the oncologist changed the fit/frail estimation based on life 
expectancy calculated using the ePrognosis tool. The main treatment goals, 
either longevity or quality of life (QoL), from the patient's and caregiver's 
perspective were noted and compared.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Comparison of the 
oncologist's and the caregiver's frailty estimation with the G8 assessment 
showed agreement and a Kappa coefficient of 58.3% (0.231) and 60% (0.255), 
respectively. The ePrognosis score and the odds of change in the frailty 
estimation by the oncologist showed no correlation. Regarding preferences, 28 
(57.1%) and 17 (34.7%) patients and eighteen (47.3%) and seventeen (44.7%) 
caregivers chose longevity and QoL, respectively. The observed agreement and 
Kappa coefficient were 78.8% and 0.578.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the G8 assessment, frailty was underestimated by both 
oncologists and caregivers. Most of the patients chose longevity over QoL, and 
the preferences between the patient and the caregiver matched in the majority of 
cases.
