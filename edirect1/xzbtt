BACKGROUND: Influenza is a common viral respiratory infection that causes 
epidemics and pandemics in the human population. Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase 
inhibitor-a new class of antiviral therapy for influenza. Although its efficacy 
and safety have been established, there is uncertainty regarding whether 
influenza-like illness (ILI) in children is best managed by oseltamivir at the 
onset of illness, and its cost-effectiveness in children has not been studied in 
China.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of post rapid influenza diagnostic 
test (RIDT) treatment with oseltamivir and empiric treatment with oseltamivir 
comparing with no antiviral therapy against influenza for children with ILI.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model based on previously published 
evidence to simulate and evaluate 1-year potential clinical and economic 
outcomes associated with three managing strategies for children presenting with 
symptoms of influenza. Model inputs were derived from literature and expert 
opinion of clinical practice and research in China. Outcome measures included 
costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). All the interventions were compared 
with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: In base case analysis, empiric treatment with oseltamivir consistently 
produced the greatest gains in QALY. When compared with no antiviral therapy, 
the empiric treatment with oseltamivir strategy is very cost effective with an 
ICER of RMB 4,438. When compared with the post RIDT treatment with oseltamivir, 
the empiric treatment with oseltamivir strategy is dominant. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis projected that there is a 100% probability that empiric 
oseltamivir treatment would be considered as a very cost-effective strategy 
compared to the no antiviral therapy, according to the WHO recommendations for 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. The same was concluded with 99% probability for 
empiric oseltamivir treatment being a very cost-effective strategy compared to 
the post RIDT treatment with oseltamivir.
CONCLUSION: In the Chinese setting of current health system, our modelling based 
simulation analysis suggests that empiric treatment with oseltamivir to be a 
cost-saving and very cost-effective strategy in managing children with ILI.

Peripheral CD4+ T-cell levels are not fully restored in a significant proportion 
of HIV+ individuals displaying long-term viral suppression on c-ART. These 
immunological nonresponders (INRs) have a higher risk of developing AIDS and 
non-AIDS events and a lower life expectancy than the general population, but the 
underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We used an in vitro system to 
analyze the T- and B-cell potential of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. 
Comparisons of INRs with matched HIV+ patients with high CD4+ T-cell counts 
(immune responders (IRs)) revealed an impairment of the generation of T-cell 
progenitors, but not of B-cell progenitors, in INRs. This impairment resulted in 
the presence of smaller numbers of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) in the blood 
and lower peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts. We investigated the molecular pathways 
involved in lymphopoiesis, focusing particularly on T-cell fate specification 
(Notch pathway), survival (IL7R-IL7 axis) and death (Fas, P2X7, CD39/CD73). P2X7 
expression was abnormally strong and there was no CD73 mRNA in the CD34+ cells 
of INRs, highlighting a role for the ATP pathway. This was confirmed by the 
demonstration that in vitro inhibition of the P2X7-mediated pathway restored the 
T-cell potential of CD34+ cells from INRs. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis 
revealed major differences in cell survival and death pathways between CD34+ 
cells from INRs and those from IRs. These findings pave the way for the use of 
complementary immunotherapies, such as P2X7 antagonists, to restore T-cell 
lymphopoiesis in INRs.

The time trade-off (TTO) valuation technique is widely used to determine utility 
values of health outcomes to inform quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
calculations for use in economic evaluation. Protocols for implementing TTO vary 
in aspects such as the trade-off framework, iteration procedure and its 
administration model and method, training of respondents and interviewers, and 
quality control of data collection. The most widely studied and utilized TTO 
valuation protocols are the Measurement and Valuation of Health (MVH) protocol, 
the Paris protocol and the EuroQol Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) protocol, all 
developed by members of the EuroQol Group. The MVH protocol and its successor, 
the Paris protocol, were developed for valuation of EQ-5D-3L health states. Both 
protocols were designed for a trained interviewer to elicit preferences from a 
respondent using the conventional TTO framework with a fixed time horizon of 
10 years and an iteration procedure combining bisection and titration. Developed 
for valuation of EQ-5D-5L health states, the EQ-VT protocol adopted a composite 
TTO framework and made use of computer technology to facilitate data collection. 
Training and monitoring of interviewers and respondents is a pivotal component 
of the EQ-VT protocol. Research is underway aiming to further improve the 
EuroQol protocols, which form an important basis for the current practice of 
health technology assessment in many countries.

OBJECTIVE: Conduct an economic evaluation based on best currently available 
evidence comparing alternative treatments levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine 
system, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, combined oral contraceptive pill 
(COCP) and 'no treatment' to prevent recurrence of endometriosis after 
conservative surgery in primary care, and to inform the design of a planned 
trial-based economic evaluation.
METHODS: We developed a state transition (Markov) model with a 36-month 
follow-up. The model structure was informed by a pragmatic review and clinical 
experts. The economic evaluation adopted a UK National Health Service 
perspective and was based on an outcome of incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY). As available data were limited, intentionally wide 
distributions were assigned around model inputs, and the average costs and 
outcome of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses were reported.
RESULTS: On average, all strategies were more expensive and generated fewer 
QALYs compared to no treatment. However, uncertainty attributing to the 
transition probabilities affected the results. Inputs relating to effectiveness, 
changes in treatment and the time at which the change is made were the main 
causes of uncertainty, illustrating areas where robust and specific data 
collection is required.
CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence to support any treatment being 
recommended to prevent the recurrence of endometriosis following conservative 
surgery. The study highlights the importance of developing decision models at 
the outset of a trial to identify data requirements to conduct a robust 
post-trial analysis.

BACKGROUND: Implantable pulse generator (IPG) replacement is considered a simple 
procedure, but in case of extension cable damage or IPG pocket infection, it can 
dramatically affect a patient's quality of life. Higher risk of infection has 
been reported after IPG replacement procedures rather than after primary deep 
brain stimulation lead implantation, and some authors suggested that the IPG 
pocket capsule could play a pivotal role in causing it. In this technical note 
we present a capsulectomy technique adopted in IPG replacement procedures.
METHODS: Between July and October 2015, we carried out ten outpatient IPG 
replacement procedures at the chest and abdomen under local anesthesia for 
battery depletion using the PEAK PlasmaBlade(TM). All patients were followed for 
at least 2 months to rule out any hardware malfunction and infection.
RESULTS: All ten procedures were uneventful. No extension cable damage occurred. 
No IPG pocket infection occurred, also not in the follow-up. Mean surgical time 
was 30 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete capsulectomy is not feasible with basic surgical 
instruments, and the PEAK PlasmaBlade(TM) pencil appears to be a helpful tool in 
carrying out the procedure.

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are common in neurological settings 
and often associated with considerable distress and disability. The 
psychological mechanisms underlying PNES are poorly understood and there is a 
lack of well-established, evidence-based treatments. This paper advances our 
understanding of PNES by providing a comprehensive systematic review of the 
evidence pertaining to the main theoretical models of this phenomenon. 
Methodological quality appraisal and effect size calculation were conducted on 
one hundred forty empirical studies on the following aspects of PNES: life 
adversity, dissociation, anxiety, suggestibility, attentional dysfunction, 
family/relationship problems, insecure attachment, defence mechanisms, 
somatization/conversion, coping, emotion regulation, alexithymia, emotional 
processing, symptom modelling, learning and expectancy. Although most of the 
studies were only of low to moderate quality, some findings are sufficiently 
consistent to warrant tentative conclusions: (i) physical symptom reporting is 
elevated in patients with PNES; (ii) trait dissociation and exposure to 
traumatic events are common but not inevitable correlates of PNES; (iii) there 
is a mismatch between subjective reports of anxiety and physical arousal during 
PNES; and (iv) inconsistent findings in this area are likely to be attributable 
to the heterogeneity of patients with PNES. Empirical, theoretical and clinical 
implications are discussed.

Major challenges for the clinical translation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
include overcoming the poor plasma half-life, site-specific delivery and 
modulation of gene silencing. In this work, we exploit the intrinsic transport 
properties of human serum albumin to tune the blood circulatory half-life, 
hepatic accumulation and gene silencing; based on the number of siRNA 
cholesteryl modifications. We demonstrate by a gel shift assay a strong and 
specific affinity of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) towards 
cholesteryl-modified siRNA (Kd>1×10(-7)M) dependent on number of modifications. 
The rHSA/siRNA complex exhibited reduced nuclease degradation and reduced 
induction of TNF-α production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 
increased solubility of heavily cholesteryl modified siRNA in the presence of 
rHSA facilitated duplex annealing and consequent interaction that allowed in 
vivo studies using multiple cholesteryl modifications. A 
structural-activity-based screen of in vitro EGFP-silencing was used to select 
optimal siRNA designs containing cholesteryl modifications within the sense 
strand that were used for in vivo studies. We demonstrate plasma half-life 
extension in NMRI mice from t1/2 12min (naked) to t1/2 45min (single 
cholesteryl) and t1/2 71min (double cholesteryl) using fluorescent live 
bioimaging. The biodistribution showed increased accumulation in the liver for 
the double cholesteryl modified siRNA that correlated with an increase in 
hepatic Factor VII gene silencing of 28% (rHSA/siRNA) compared to 4% (naked 
siRNA) 6days post-injection. This work presents a novel albumin-mediated 
cholesteryl design-based strategy for tuning pharmacokinetics and systemic gene 
silencing.

PURPOSE: Cardiac toxicity due to conventional breast radiation therapy (RT) has 
been extensively reported, and it affects both the life expectancy and quality 
of life of affected women. Given the favorable oncologic outcomes in most women 
irradiated for breast cancer, it is increasingly paramount to minimize treatment 
side effects and improve survivorship for these patients. Proton RT offers 
promise in limiting heart dose, but the modality is costly and access is 
limited. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we provide a decision-making tool to 
help determine which breast cancer patients may benefit from proton RT referral.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov cohort model was constructed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of proton versus photon RT for breast cancer management. The 
model was analyzed for different strata of women based on age (40 years, 50 
years, and 60 years) and the presence or lack of cardiac risk factors (CRFs). 
Model entrants could have 1 of 3 health states: healthy, alive with coronary 
heart disease (CHD), or dead. Base-case analysis assumed CHD was managed 
medically. No difference in tumor control was assumed between arms. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to test model robustness and 
the influence of including catheterization as a downstream possibility within 
the health state of CHD.
RESULTS: Proton RT was not cost-effective in women without CRFs or a mean heart 
dose (MHD) <5 Gy. Base-case analysis noted cost-effectiveness for proton RT in 
women with ≥1 CRF at an approximate minimum MHD of 6 Gy with a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. For women 
with ≥1 CRF, probabilistic sensitivity analysis noted the preference of proton 
RT for an MHD ≥5 Gy with a similar willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the cost of treatment, scenarios do exist whereby proton 
therapy is cost-effective. Referral for proton therapy may be cost-effective for 
patients with ≥1 CRF in cases for which photon plans are unable to achieve an 
MHD <5 Gy.

AIMS: Cost-effectiveness analysis of sofosbuvir combined with peginterferon 
alpha-2a and ribavirin (SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV) in early versus advanced fibrosis in 
previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 (CHC-GT1), 
from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS).
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare lifetime costs and outcomes 
(life years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of 2 
treatment strategies: SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV administered during early fibrosis 
(mild-moderate fibrosis; F2-F3) or advanced fibrosis (cirrhosis; F4). Efficacy 
(sustained virologic response), annual transition probabilities, disease 
management costs and utilities were obtained from the literature. Costs and 
outcomes were discounted annually at 3%. Direct costs were considered, expressed 
in Euros (€, 2014). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also performed.
RESULTS: SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy at F2-F3 was more effective (19.12 LYGs and 
14.14 QALYs) compared to F4. In a cohort of 1,000 patients, SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV 
prevented 66 cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 60 hepatocellular carcinomas and 
4 liver transplantations compared with therapy in advanced fibrosis. The total 
lifetime cost of early therapy (€43,263) was less than the cost of treatment in 
the advanced stage (€49,018). Early therapy was a dominant strategy, more 
effective and less costly in all simulations. In the PSA analysis, 
administration of SOF/PEG-IFN/RBV at F2-F3 was dominant in all simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Starting SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy at F2-F3, compared with therapy at 
F4, reduced the incidence of liver disease complications and was associated with 
cost savings for the Spanish NHS in CHC-GT1 patients.

BACKGROUND: HPV is a major cancer-causing factor in both sexes in the cervix, 
vulva, vagina, anus, penis, oropharynx as well as the causal factor in other 
diseases such as genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatis. In the 
context of the arrival of a nonavalent HPV vaccine (6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58), 
this analysis aims to estimate the public health impact and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of a universal (girls and boys) vaccination program with a 
nonavalent HPV vaccine as compared to the current universal vaccination program 
with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (6/11/16/18), in Austria.
METHOD: A dynamic transmission model including a wide range of health and cost 
outcomes related to cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal diseases and genital warts 
was calibrated to Austrian epidemiological data. The clinical impact due to the 
5 new types was included for cervical and anal diseases outcomes only. In the 
base case, a two-dose schedule, lifelong vaccine type-specific protection and a 
vaccination coverage rate of 60% and 40% for girls and boys respectively for the 
9-year old cohorts were assumed. A cost-effectiveness threshold of 
€30,000/QALY-gained was considered.
RESULTS: Universal vaccination with the nonavalent vaccine was shown to reduce 
the incidence of HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 -related cervical cancer by 92%, the 
related CIN2/3 cases by 96% and anal cancer by 83% and 76% respectively in 
females and males after 100 years, relative to 75%, 76%, 80% and 74% with the 
quadrivalent vaccine, respectively. Furthermore, the nonavalent vaccine was 
projected to prevent an additional 14,893 cases of CIN2/3 and 2544 cases of 
cervical cancer, over 100 years. Depending on the vaccine price, the strategy 
was shown to be from cost-saving to cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The present evaluation showed that vaccinating 60% of girls and 40% 
of boys aged 9 in Austria with a 9-valent vaccine will substantially reduce the 
incidence of cervical cancer, CIN and anal cancer compared to the existing 
strategy. The vaccination strategies performed with the 9-valent vaccine in the 
current study were all found to be cost-effective compared to the current 
quadrivalent vaccination strategy by considering a cost-effectiveness threshold

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term safety, efficacy, and 
quality of life (QOL) of ≤400-mg/day USL255, Qudexy® XR (topiramate) 
extended-release capsules, as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures 
(POS) in adults.
METHODS: Patients who completed the 11-week double-blind treatment phase of the 
phase 3 PREVAIL study were eligible to enroll in this 1-year open-label 
extension (OLE) study (PREVAIL OLE). The primary objective was to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of USL255 (including treatment-emergent adverse events 
[TEAEs]). The secondary objective was to assess seizure frequency in patients 
(e.g., median percent reduction from baseline in weekly POS frequency, responder 
rate [proportion of patients with ≥25%, ≥50%, ≥75%, or 100% reduction from 
baseline in POS frequency], and seizure-free intervals [proportion of patients 
who were seizure-free for 4, 12, 24, 36, or 48weeks]). Exploratory 
clinical-status endpoints included the Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and 
Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Problems (QOLIE-31-P) questionnaires. Post hoc 
analyses evaluated neurocognitive TEAE incidences during the first 11 and entire 
55weeks of treatment and efficacy by patient age and drug-resistant status.
RESULTS: Of the 217 patients who completed PREVAIL (USL255, n=103; placebo, 
n=114), 210 (97%) enrolled in PREVAIL OLE and were included in the ITT 
population. Across the entire 55-week treatment period, USL255 was generally 
safe and well tolerated, with low individual neurocognitive TEAE incidences. 
Seizure reduction was sustained across the year-long study and observed in 
patient subgroups, including those with highly drug-resistant seizures and those 
≥50years of age. Improvements in CGI-C and QOLIE-31-P were also observed.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results of PREVAIL OLE are consistent with those from PREVAIL 
and demonstrate that adjunctive treatment with up to 400mg/day of USL255 may be 
a safe and effective treatment option for a variety of adult patients with 
refractory POS.

AIMS: (1) To compare alcohol-attributed disease burden in four Nordic countries 
1990-2013, by overall disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and separated by 
premature mortality [years of life lost (YLL)] and health loss to non-fatal 
conditions [years lived with disability (YLD)]; (2) to examine whether changes 
in alcohol consumption informs alcohol-attributed disease burden; and (3) to 
compare the distribution of disease burden separated by causes.
DESIGN: A comparative risk assessment approach.
SETTING: Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.
PARTICIPANTS: Male and female populations of each country.
MEASUREMENTS: Age-standardized DALYs, YLLs and YLDs per 100 000 with 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs).
FINDINGS: In Finland, with the highest burden over the study period, overall 
alcohol-attributed DALYs were 1616 per 100 000 in 2013, while in Norway, with 
the lowest burden, corresponding estimates were 634. DALYs in Denmark were 1246 
and in Sweden 788. In Denmark and Finland, changes in consumption generally 
corresponded to changes in disease burden, but not to the same extent in Sweden 
and Norway. All countries had a similar disease pattern and the majority of 
DALYs were due to YLLs (62-76%), mainly from alcohol use disorder, cirrhosis, 
transport injuries, self-harm and violence. YLDs from alcohol use disorder 
accounted for 41% and 49% of DALYs in Denmark and Finland compared to 63 and 64% 
in Norway and Sweden 2013, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Finland and Denmark has a higher alcohol-attributed disease burden 
than Sweden and Norway in the period 1990-2013. Changes in consumption levels in 
general corresponded to changes in harm in Finland and Denmark, but not in 
Sweden and Norway for some years. All countries followed a similar pattern. The 
majority of disability-adjusted life years were due to premature mortality. 
Alcohol use disorder by non-fatal conditions accounted for a higher proportion 
of disability-adjusted life years in Norway and Sweden, compared with Finland 
and Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) has been proposed as a 
summary measure of population health because it encompasses multiple health 
domains as well as length of life. However, trends in QALE by education or other 
socio-economic measure have not yet been reported. This study investigates 
changes in QALE stratified by educational level for the Dutch population in the 
period 2001-2011.
METHODS: Using data from multiple sources, we estimated mortality rates and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as functions of age, gender, calendar 
year and educational level. Subsequently, predictions from these regressions 
were combined for calculating QALE at ages 25 and 65. QALE changes were 
decomposed into effects of mortality and HRQoL.
RESULTS: In 2001-2011, QALE increased for men and women at all educational 
levels, the largest increases being for highly educated resulting in a widening 
gap by education. In 2001, at age 25, the absolute QALE difference between the 
low and the highly educated was 7.4 healthy years (36.7 vs. 44.1) for men and 
6.3 healthy years (39.5 vs. 45.8) for women. By 2011, the QALE difference 
increased to 8.1 healthy years (38.8 vs. 46.9) for men and to 7.1 healthy years 
(41.3 vs. 48.4) for women. Similar results were observed at age 65. Although the 
gap was largely attributable to widening inequalities in mortality, widening 
inequalities in HRQoL were also substantial.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, population health as measured by QALE has 
improved, but QALE inequalities have widened more than inequalities in life 
expectancy alone.

PURPOSE: In this analysis, we compared costs and explored the cost-effectiveness 
of subsequent-line treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab in patients with 
wild-type KRAS (exon 2) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after previous 
chemotherapy treatment failure. Data were used from ASPECCT (A Study of 
Panitumumab Efficacy and Safety Compared to Cetuximab in Patients With KRAS 
Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer), a Phase III, head-to-head randomized 
noninferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of panitumumab and 
cetuximab in this population.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to perform a cost-minimization 
analysis and a semi-Markov model was created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of panitumumab monotherapy versus cetuximab monotherapy in 
chemotherapy-resistant wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC. The cost-minimization model 
assumed equivalent efficacy (progression-free survival) based on data from 
ASPECCT. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with the full information 
(uncertainty) from ASPECCT. Both analyses were conducted from a US third-party 
payer perspective and calculated average anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 
doses from ASPECCT. Costs associated with drug acquisition, treatment 
administration (every 2 weeks for panitumumab, weekly for cetuximab), and 
incidence of infusion reactions were estimated in both models. The 
cost-effectiveness model also included physician visits, disease progression 
monitoring, best supportive care, and end-of-life costs and utility weights 
estimated from EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire responses from ASPECCT.
FINDINGS: The cost-minimization model results demonstrated lower projected costs 
for patients who received panitumumab versus cetuximab, with a projected cost 
savings of $9468 (16.5%) per panitumumab-treated patient. In the 
cost-effectiveness model, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained revealed panitumumab to be less costly, with marginally better outcomes 
than cetuximab.
IMPLICATIONS: These economic analyses comparing panitumumab and cetuximab in 
chemorefractory wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC suggest benefits in favor of 
panitumumab. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01001377.

Bradykinesia is associated with reduced quality of life and medication 
non-compliance, and it may be a prodrome for schizophrenia. Therefore, 
screening/monitoring for subtle bradykinesia is of clinical and scientific 
importance. This study investigated the validity and reliability of such an 
instrument. Included were 70 patients with psychotic disorders. Inertial sensors 
captured mean cycle duration, amplitude and velocity of four movement tasks: 
walking, elbow flexion/extension, forearm pronation/supination and leg agility. 
The concurrent validity with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
(UPDRS) bradykinesia subscale was determined using regression analysis. 
Reliability was investigated with the intra-class correlation coefficient. The 
duration, amplitude and velocities of the four tasks measured by the instrument 
explained 67% of the variance on the UPDRS bradykinesia subscale. The instrument 
test-retest reliability was high. The instrument investigated in this study is a 
valid and reliable alternative to observer-rated scales. It is an ideal tool for 
monitoring bradykinesia as it requires little training and experience to achieve 
reliable results.

Despite steady vaccination coverage rates, pertussis incidence in the United 
States has continued to rise. This public health challenge has motivated calls 
for the development of a new vaccine with greater efficacy and duration of 
protection. Any next-generation vaccine would likely come at a higher cost, and 
must provide sufficient health benefits beyond those provided by the current 
vaccine in order to be deemed cost-effective. Using an age-structured 
transmission model of pertussis, we quantified the health and economic benefits 
of a next-generation vaccine that would enhance either the efficacy or duration 
of protection of the childhood series, the duration of the adult booster, or a 
combination. We developed a metric, the maximum cost-effective price increase 
(MCPI), to compare the potential value of such improvements. The MCPI estimates 
the per-dose price increase that would maintain the cost-effectiveness of 
pertussis vaccination. We evaluated the MCPI across a range of potential single 
and combined improvements to the pertussis vaccine. As an upper bound, we found 
that a next-generation vaccine which could achieve perfect efficacy for the 
childhood series would permit an MCPI of $18 per dose (95% CI: $12-$31). 
Pertussis vaccine improvements that extend the duration of protection to an 
average of 75 years would allow for an MCPI of $22 per dose for the childhood 
series (CI: $10-$33) or $12 for the adult booster (CI: $4-$18). Despite the 
short duration of the adult booster, improvements to the childhood series could 
be more valuable than improvements to the adult booster. Combining improvements 
in both efficacy and duration, a childhood series with perfect efficacy and 
average duration of 75 years would permit an MCPI of $39 per dose, the highest 
of any scenario evaluated. Our results highlight the utility of the MCPI metric 
in evaluating potential vaccines or other interventions when prices are unknown.

Turner syndrome (TS) is one of the most common sex chromosome abnormalities and 
results from total or partial monosomy of the X chromosome. It occurs in 1 in 
2000 newborn girls and is also believed to be present in a larger proportion of 
conceptuses. There are various anatomic anomalies that have been associated with 
TS and the consequences of late recognition of these anomalies can be 
devastating. Aortic dilation and dissection occur at increased rates in TS 
patients and contribute to the decreased life expectancy of these patients. Such 
cases have prompted the need for early identification and continuous monitoring. 
Other anatomic variations increase morbidity in this population, and negatively 
impact the social and reproductive aspects of their lives. In this review, we 
summarize the cardiovascular, neurological, genitourinary, otolaryngolical, 
craniofacial, and skeletal defects associated with TS. To elucidate these 
morphological variations, novel illustrations have also been constructed. Clin.

A 51-year-old female with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent a cardiac 
catheterization via right common femoral vein and artery. Prolonged compression 
with a bandage and extension of supine bed rest were needed. Immediately after 
standing up, she lost consciousness and developed electromechanical 
dissociation. The echocardiogram revealed a huge thrombus filling the main 
pulmonary trunk and massive enlargement of right ventricle, which suggested 
acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Images of computed tomography taken 2 
months later detected a huge venous aneurysm of the right popliteal vein. 
Prolonged compression at the groin area might enhance blood stasis of the 
ipsilateral popliteal venous aneurysm, followed by life-threatening PTE.

BACKGROUND: The addition of annual MRI screening to mammography has heightened 
optimism that intensive screening along with improved treatments may 
substantially improve life expectancy of women at high risk of breast cancer. 
However, survival data from BRCA2 mutation carriers undergoing intensive 
combined breast screening are scarce.
METHODS: We have collated the results of screening with either annual 
mammography or mammography with MRI in female BRCA2 mutation carriers in 
Manchester and Oslo and use a Manchester control group of BRCA2 mutation 
carriers who had their first breast cancer diagnosed without intensive 
screening.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven BRCA2 mutation carriers had undergone combined (n = 34) or 
mammography (n = 53) screening compared to 274 without such intensive screening. 
Ten year breast cancer specific survival was 100 % in the combined group (95 % 
CI 82.5-100 %) and 85.5 % (95 % CI 72.6-98.4 %) in the mammography group 
compared to 74.6 % (95 % CI 66.6-82.6 %) in the control group. Better survival 
was driven by lymph node status (negative in 67 % of screened vs 39 % of 
unscreened women; p < 0.001) and a significantly greater proportion of 
intensively screened women had invasive breast cancers <2 cm at diagnosis 
(74.6 % vs 50.4 %; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Intensive combined breast cancer screening with annual MRI and 
mammography appears to improve survival from breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation 
carriers. Data from larger groups are required to confirm the effectiveness of 
combined screening in BRCA2 carriers.
