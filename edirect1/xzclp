Mild inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leads to longevity. Disruption of 
mitochondrial respiratory components extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, 
but the effects appear to be complex and the underlying mechanism for lifespan 
regulation by mitochondrial respiratory genes is still not fully understood. 
Here, we investigated the role of Y82E9BR.3, a worm homolog of the ATP synthase 
subunit C, in modulating longevity in C. elegans. We found that the Y82E9BR.3 
protein is localized in mitochondria and expressed in various tissues throughout 
development. RNAi knockdown of Y82E9BR.3 extends lifespan, decreases the 
accumulation of lipofuscin, and affects various physiological processes, 
including development delay, reproduction impairment and slow behavior. Further 
tissue-specific RNAi analysis showed that the intestine is a crucial organ for 
the longevity effects conferred by Y82E9BR.3 RNAi. Moreover, we demonstrated 
that lifespan extension by Y82E9BR.3 RNAi is associated with reduced 
mitochondrial function, as well as the suppression of complex I activity in 
mitochondria. Unexpectedly, Y82E9BR.3 RNAi knock down did not influence the 
whole-worm ATP level. Our findings first reveal the crucial role of Y82E9BR.3 in 
mitochondrial function and the underlying mechanism of how Y82E9BR.3 regulates 
lifespan in C. elegans.

Management of metastatic bone disease is still evolving and is dependent upon 
many factors including the primary tumour type, expected life expectancy, site 
and size of lesion, character of the lesion, lytic or blastic, and the number of 
lesions. Active orthopaedic surgical intervention is usually required at the 
time of pathological fracture either impending or actual. Management options are 
either in situ fixation or replacement/arthroplasty. The role of post-operative 
radiotherapy is still not clearly defined and its biological effect on healing 
of pathological fracture is unclear. In this report, we describe a case of 
breast carcinoma with a large metastatic lytic lesion in the proximal femur, 
which was treated by in situ fixation followed by hormonal therapy and external 
beam radiotherapy. In the post-operative period, rapid and dramatic ossification 
and reformation of the proximal femur was observed.

Studies assessing the impact of extrinsic factors on skin aging have increased 
during the last with the increase in life expectancy. Although most of the 
studies are about the sun radiation impact, many factors should be considered in 
elderly people, beyond environmental conditions. Lifestyle factors, like diet, 
sleeping, smoking, should be analyzed carefully, as common age-related 
conditions (menopause, diabetes, pulmonary diseases, etc.). All these factors 
could accelerate the natural decline of skin structure and functions, possibly 
affecting the responses to treatments and drugs. This review demonstrates that 
growing evidence regarding environmental factors that are associated with 
lifestyle and comorbidities deserve greater attention from researchers and 
dermatologists and may require new approaches in the management of skin aging.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is one of the most important severe 
complications of liver cirrhosis. Thought to be caused by elevated blood levels 
of gut-derived neurotoxins (particularly ammonia) entering the brain, HE 
manifests as a wide range of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, which 
increase the risk of mortality, result in substantial morbidity and negatively 
affect the quality of life (QoL) of both patients and their caregivers. HE is 
also associated with a substantial economic burden. Rifaximin-α 550 mg is a 
locally acting oral antibiotic that reduces the effects of ammonia-producing 
intestinal flora, and which is used to help reduce the recurrence of overt HE. 
The efficacy of rifaximin-α 550 mg was established in a randomised controlled 
trial and long-term extension study. However, 'real-world' evidence is also 
required to assess how this efficacy may translate into effectiveness in 
clinical practice, including the potential impact of treatment on healthcare 
resource utilisation.
METHODS: The Prospective Real-world Outcomes Study of HE Patients' Experience on 
Rifaximin-α 550 mg (PROSPER) is a multinational, multicentre, observational 
study that will be conducted under real-world clinical practice conditions. 
Comprising a retrospective phase (up to 12 months) and a prospective phase (up 
to 24 months), and employing a robust statistical methodology, PROSPER has been 
specifically designed to minimise the bias associated with observational 
studies. The primary endpoint will be the effect of rifaximin-α 550 mg treatment 
on HE- and liver-related hospitalisation rate and duration of hospitalisation. 
Secondary endpoints will include comprehensive assessments of the impact of 
treatment on the QoL and workplace productivity of patients and caregivers, a 
global assessment of treatment effectiveness and safety/tolerability. 
Approximately 550 patients will be enrolled.
CONCLUSIONS: PROSPER will provide valuable real-world information on the 
effectiveness of rifaximin-α 550 mg in reducing the recurrence of HE, and its 
impact on the QoL and work productivity of patients and their caregivers. By 
providing data on both the direct costs (e.g., hospitalisation rate, duration of 
hospitalisation) and indirect costs (such as work productivity) of HE, PROSPER 
should help confirm whether rifaximin-α 550 mg treatment represents a good use 
of economic resources.

Background: Patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer who have adverse 
pathological findings experience high rates of recurrence. While there are data 
supporting adjuvant radiotherapy compared to a wait-and-watch strategy to reduce 
recurrence rates, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant 
radiotherapy with the other standard of care, salvage radiotherapy (radiotherapy 
administered at the time of recurrence). Methods: We constructed a health state 
transition (Markov) model employing two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation using 
a lifetime horizon to compare the quality-adjusted survival associated with 
postoperative strategies using adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy. Prior to 
analysis, we calibrated and validated our model using the results of previous 
randomized controlled trials. We considered clinically important oncological 
health states from immediately postoperative to prostate cancer-specific death, 
commonly described complications from prostate cancer treatment, and other 
causes of mortality. Transition probabilities and utilities for disease states 
were derived from a literature search of MEDLINE and expert consensus. Results: 
Salvage radiotherapy was associated with an increased quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) (58.3 months) as compared with adjuvant radiotherapy (53.7 
months), a difference of 4.6 months (standard deviation 8.8). Salvage 
radiotherapy had higher QALE in 53% of hypothetical cohorts. There was a minimal 
difference in overall life expectancy (-0.1 months). Examining recurrence rates, 
our model showed validity when compared with available randomized controlled 
data. Conclusions: A salvage radiotherapy strategy appears to provide improved 
QALE for patients with adverse pathological findings following radical 
prostatectomy, compared with adjuvant radiotherapy. As these findings reflect, 
population averages, specific patient and tumor factors, and patient preferences 
remain central for individualized management.

Background: Multiple medical organizations recommend using life expectancy (LE) 
to individualize diabetes care goals. We compare the performance of patient LE 
predictions made by physicians to LE predictions from a simulation model (the 
Chicago model) in a cohort of older diabetic patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of a convenience sample (n = 447) of diabetes 
patients over 65 years and their physicians. Measurements: Physicians provided 
LE estimates for individual patients during a baseline survey (2000-2003). The 
prognostic model included a comprehensive geriatric type 2 diabetes simulation 
model (the Chicago model) and combinations of the physician estimate and the 
Chicago model ("And," "Or," and "Average" models). Observed survival was 
determined based on the National Death Index through 31 December 2010. The 
predictive accuracy of LE predictions was assessed using c-statistic for 5-year 
mortality; Harrell's c-statistic, and Integrated Brier score for overall 
survival. Results: The patient cohort had a mean (SD) age of 73.4 (5.9) years. 
The majority were female (62.6%) and black (79.4%). At 5 years, 108 (24.2%) 
patients had died. The c-statistic for 5-year mortality was similar for 
physicians (0.69) and the Chicago model (0.68), while the average of estimates 
by physicians and Chicago model yielded the highest c-statistic of any method 
tested (0.73). The estimates of overall survival yielded a similar pattern of 
results. Limitations: Generalizability of patient cohort and lack of updated 
model parameters. Conclusions: Compared with individual methods, the average of 
LE estimates by physicians and the Chicago model had the best predictive 
performance. Prognostic models, such as the Chicago model, may complement and 
support physicians' intuitions as they consider treatment decisions and goals 
for older patients with chronic conditions like diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: To report on the prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis of spina bifida 
(SB) and its natural history, treatment and long-term outcome in a large 
tertiary referral center.
METHODS: All cases of SB diagnosed between February 1980 and December 2015 in 
the Obstetric Prenatal Diagnosis Day Unit of the Obstetrics and Gynecology 
Department at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, were reviewed. 
All infants with an open defect were delivered by elective Cesarean section and 
underwent early repair of the spinal defect. A ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt 
and/or third ventriculostomy was performed when needed. Complete postnatal 
follow-up was carried out by our multidisciplinary team in the majority of 
cases. The cohort was analyzed in two groups: Group 1 included patients referred 
between February 1980 and December 1999; Group 2 included patients referred 
between January 2000 and December 2015.
RESULTS: There was a total of 222 cases of SB with a prenatal diagnosis rate of 
94.6% (n = 210), with the majority of defects being meningomyeloceles (n = 142 
(64.0%)), affecting the lumbosacral level (n = 110 (49.5%)) and being ≥ 2 cm in 
size (n = 163/195 (83.6%)). There were 174 (78.4%) live births, with more 
terminations in Group 2 (26.1%) than in Group 1 (10.8%; P = 0.003). Postnatal 
surgical repair was conducted in 157 cases (99.4% of eligible cases), with death 
of an infant who was operated on occurring more often in Group 1 (14.1%) than in 
Group 2 (4.2%; P = 0.03). VP shunt placement was required in 60.3% of infants 
operated on after January 2000. Long-term follow-up was available for 136 
children (111 with open defects and 25 with closed defects). Infants born since 
2000 with an open defect had normal ambulation or a mild defect in 50% of cases 
and normal or mild deficit of sphincter function in 37.8% of cases. An 
intelligence quotient of ≥ 70 was observed in the majority of children (81.4%; 
35/43 cases). Worse motor function was associated with progressive prenatal 
ventriculomegaly, level of lesion and VP shunt placement.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the prenatal diagnosis, natural history and long-term 
outcome of a large contemporary cohort of SB fetuses and infants. In an era of 
pioneering fetal surgical techniques for in-utero SB repair, it is important to 
acknowledge that advances in conventional neonatology and pediatric neurosurgery 
have allowed increased life expectancy and improved quality of life in patients 
with SB. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Improvements in environmental health have had the most significant impact on 
health status. In Australia, life expectancy has significantly increased through 
provision of vaccination, safe food and drinking water, appropriate sewage 
disposal and other environmental health measures. Yet the profession that is 
instrumental in delivering environmental health services at the local community 
level is overlooked. Rarely featuring in mainstream media, the successes of 
Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) are invisible to the general public. As a 
consequence, students entering university are unaware of the profession and its 
significant role in society. This has resulted in there being too few EHOs to 
meet the current regulatory requirements, much less deal with the emerging 
environmental health issues arising as a consequence of changing global 
conditions including climate change. To futureproof Australian society and 
public health this workforce issue, and the associated oversight of 
environmental health must be addressed now.

: Long-acting antiretrovirals can improve therapy and prevention for HIV-1 
infection. Current long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LAP) can be administered every 
other month. Previously, we demonstrated that a myristoylated CAB prodrug 
encased in poloxamer 407 provided extended plasma drug concentrations. We now 
demonstrate that this first-generation nanoformulated prodrug can sustain plasma 
CAB concentrations above the protein-adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration for 4 
months in rhesus macaques. A 2.5-fold extension in CAB half-life and a 1.6-fold 
increase in area under the concentration-time curve were observed compared with 
CAB LAP.

Long-term trends in incidence and risk factors for ischaemic stroke subtypes: 
Prospective population study of the South London Stroke Register.

BACKGROUND: As the average life expectancy increases, more people are predicted 
to have strokes. Recent studies have shown an increasing incidence in certain 
types of cerebral infarction. We aimed to estimate time trends in incidence, 
prior risk factors, and use of preventive treatments for ischaemic stroke (IS) 
aetiological subtypes and to ascertain any demographic disparities.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Population-based data from the South London Stroke 
Register (SLSR) between 2000 and 2015 were studied. IS was classified, based on 
the underlying mechanism, into large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 
cardio-embolism (CE), small-vessel occlusion (SVO), other determined aetiologies 
(OTH), and undetermined aetiologies (UND). After calculation of age-, sex-, and 
ethnicity-specific incidence rates by subtype for the 16-year period, we 
analysed trends using Cochran-Armitage tests, Poisson regression models, and 
locally estimated scatterplot smoothers (loess). A total of 3,088 patients with 
first IS were registered. Between 2000-2003 and 2012-2015, the age-adjusted 
incidence of IS decreased by 43% from 137.3 to 78.4/100,000/year (incidence rate 
ratio [IRR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.5-0.64). Significant declines were observed in all 
subtypes, particularly in SVO (37.4-18; p < 0.0001) and less in CE (39.3-25; p < 
0.0001). Reductions were recorded in males and females, younger (<55 years old) 
and older (≥55 years old) individuals, and white and black ethnic groups, though 
not significantly in the latter (144.6-116.2; p = 0.31 for IS). A 4-fold 
increase in prior-to-stroke use of statins was found (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 
4.39, 95% CI 3.29-5.86), and despite the increasing prevalence of hypertension 
(OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.21-1.96) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.22-2.36), 
preventive use of antihypertensive and antiplatelet drugs was declining. A 
smaller number of participants in certain subgroup-specific analyses (e.g., 
black ethnicity and LAA subtype) could have limited the power to identify 
significant trends.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ISs has been declining since 2000 in all age 
groups but to a lesser extent in the black population. The reported changes in 
medication use are unlikely to fully explain the reduction in stroke incidence; 
however, innovative prevention strategies and better management of risk factors 
may contribute further reduction.

Since ancient times, the aim of orthopedic surgery has been to correct limb and 
joint deformities, including those resulting from central nervous system 
lesions. Recent developments in the treatment of spasticity have led to changes 
in concepts and management strategies. The increase in life expectancy has 
increased the functional needs of patients. Orthopedic surgery, along with 
treatments for spasticity, improves the functional capacity of patients with 
neuro-orthopaedic disorders, improving their autonomy. In this paper, we 
describe key moments in the history of orthopedic surgery regarding the 
treatment of patients with central nervous system lesions, from poliomyelitis to 
stroke-related hemiplegia, from the limbs to the spine, and from contractures to 
heterotopic ossification. A synthesis of the current surgical techniques is then 
provided, and the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and management is 
highlighted, along with indications for medical, rehabilitation and surgical 
treatments and their combinations. We explain why it is essential to consider 
patients' expectations and to set achievable goals, particularly before surgery, 
which is by nature irreversible. More recently, specialized surgical teams have 
begun to favor the use of soft-tissue techniques over bony and joint procedures, 
except for spinal disorders. We highlight that orthopedic surgery is no longer 
the end-point of treatment. For example, lengthening a contractured muscle 
improves the balance around a joint, improving mobility and stability but may be 
only part of the problem. Further medical treatment and rehabilitation, or 
additional surgery, are often necessary to continue to improve the function of 
the limb. Despite the recognized effectiveness of orthopedic surgery for 
neuro-orthopedic disorders, few studies have formally evaluated them. Hence, 
there is a need for research to provide evidence to support orthopedic surgery 
for treating neuro-orthopedic disorders.

BACKGROUND: Although pharmacological treatment has increased the average life 
expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis, the median survival of females is 
shorter than that of males. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that 
estrogens play a relevant role in the disease progression. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the effects of 17β-estradiol and tamoxifen citrate (TMX) on 
calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) currents in human bronchial epithelial 
cells carrying the ΔPhe508-CFTR mutation both in homozygosis and in 
heterozygosis.
METHODS: Perforated patch clamp experiments were performed on single cells of 
the immortalized cell lines CFBE and IB3-1. Gramicidin (10 or 20 μM) was added 
to the electrode solution to reach the whole cell configuration. The electrical 
stimulation protocol consisted of square voltages ranging from - 80 to + 80 mV, 
in steps of 20 mV and with a duration of 800 msec.
RESULTS: The presence of 17β-estradiol significantly reduced the CaCC currents, 
both in basal conditions and in the presence of ATP (100 μM). The addition of 
TMX (10 μM) completely restored the currents abolished by 17β-estradiol, in 
basal conditions and after stimulation with ATP in both CFBE and IB3-1 cells. 
TMX had a strong, direct action on membrane current density, which significantly 
increased more than 4-fold in both cases. The membrane current stimulation 
produced by TMX was further enhanced by the addition of ATP. CFBE cells 
incubated for 24 h with 3 μM VX-809 (a CFTR corrector) and then acutely 
stimulated with VX-770 (a CFTR potentiator) in the presence of forskolin, showed 
an increase of chloride currents which were abolished by Inh-172. The chloride 
current density induced by TMX + ATP was, on average, greater than that obtained 
with VX-809 + VX-770 + forskolin. The currents elicited by TMX + ATP were 
abolished by the addition of NPPB, a CaCC inhibitor. The combined administration 
of TMX/ATP and VXs/FSK had an additional effect on chloride currents.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that TMX restores CaCC currents inhibited by 
17ß-estradiol and directly activates the transmembrane chloride currents 
potentiated by ATP, an effect which is mutation independent. The combined effect 
of TMX with current used treatments for cystic fibrosis could be of benefit to 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: As the life expectancy has increased in individuals with cerebral 
palsy, this has led to being able to assess the changes in the bio-psycho-social 
dimensions of their health.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to describe the characteristics of 
individuals with cerebral palsy and to evaluate their functional situation.
METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study conducted on a sample of 26 
individuals between 27 and 65 years old with cerebral palsy. Data was collected 
during a semi-structured interview. The Cross Motor Function Classification 
System (GMFCS), the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), and the 
Communication Function Classification System (CFCS), were used to evaluate the 
functional situation.
RESULTS: The profile of the adult seen in the Cerebral Palsy Association of 
Burgos, Spain, is male, over 40 years old, single, illiterate, with no 
professional qualification, lives in a residence, receives social benefit, and 
with great functional disability.
CONCLUSIONS: The functional capacity of people with cerebral palsy who are in 
adult care centres is low. It emphasises the low cultural level and the lack of 
professional qualification and all of them have a disability that limits their 
ability to perform daily activities, possibly related to the high mean age.

OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate whether the presence of knee crepitus is associated 
with the occurrence of total knee replacement (TKR), quality of life and 
deficits in physical function at long-term.
METHODS: Setting - This observational study uses longitudinal data (up to 4-year 
follow-up) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Participants - 4566 
participants. Main Outcome Measure(s) - Logistic regression models were used to 
test if baseline knee crepitus is associated with the occurrence of TKR. Linear 
mixed models with adjustment for confounding variables (age, gender, BMI and 
Kellgren-Lawrence grade) were used to test the association between baseline knee 
crepitus and longitudinal changes in the pain, self-reported physical function, 
quality of life and performance-based function.
RESULTS: The presence of knee crepitus at baseline does not predict the 
occurrence of TKR at 36 months (p=0.58 and 0.67 for right and left knees, 
respectively). The crepitus group presented a slightly knee extension strength 
decline from baseline to 48 months (p=0.03 for the right and 0.01 for the left 
knee; between group difference=2% for both right [95%CI=-0.12; -0.01] and left 
knees [95%CI=-0.13; -0.02]).
CONCLUSION: The presence of knee crepitus is not associated with the occurrence 
of TKR in the following three years. Knee crepitus is associated with slightly 
declines in knee extension strength, but this does not seem to affect physical 
function and quality of life at long-term.

INTRODUCTION: New therapies for multiple myeloma (MM) have improved life 
expectancy, but health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data from patients with 
MM in the real-world setting are lacking. This study, conducted in France, 
explored the associations between treatment outcomes and HRQoL in patients with 
MM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study 
enrolled patients (≥ 18 years old) with symptomatic MM who had consulted a 
physician at least once between February and March 2016. HRQoL was assessed 
using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 
Core Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Multiple 
Myeloma module (QLQ-MY20).
RESULTS: In total, 445 patients were included in the study; 402 (90%) completed 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 questionnaires. HRQoL decreased significantly 
with treatment line. Patients in the first treatment-free interval had 
relatively high scores. At later lines, patients receiving active treatment had 
better scores than those whose treatment had ended. High EORTC QLQ-C30 global 
health status scores were associated with good treatment response, few adverse 
events, and long duration of treatment, and were strongly influenced by the 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Global health status 
scores correlated well with the 4 items of the QLQ-MY20 (future perspective, 
0.46; body image, 0.41; disease symptoms, -0.57; side effects of 
treatment, -0.53).
CONCLUSION: Effective treatment options in MM can help maintain HRQoL by 
influencing treatment response levels and delaying disease progression.

Young children differ from adults in their exposure and susceptibility to 
environmental chemicals (e.g. pesticides) because of various factors such as 
behavior, diet and physiology. Their heightened vulnerability to environmental 
stressors makes it important to obtain appropriate urine samples for exposure 
characterization. However, collecting urine from non-toilet-trained children has 
been shown to be methodologically and practically challenging. Four urine 
collection approaches were tested: a disposable diaper, a urine bag, a 
collection pad and the clean catch. The success rate and the user rating of each 
method was evaluated. The success rates were 67%, 21%, 17% and 4% for the 
disposable diaper, urine bag, collection pad and clean catch, respectively. The 
average user ratings on a 0-10 (0 = inconvenient, 10 = convenient) scale were 
9.0, 4.7, 7.3 and 2.5, respectively. Subsequently, the best rated method, the 
disposable polyacrylate diaper was tested with hydroxy-tebuconazole as an 
exposure biomarker for the fungicide tebuconazole and creatinine for urine 
density adjustment. After LC-MS/MS analysis, the recoveries of 
hydroxy-tebuconazole in the range of 0.05-25 ng/mL were on average 106%, and for 
creatinine 87%. Precisions (relative standard deviation) were for both 3%. The 
overall procedure including collection and extraction was assessed, resulting in 
three out of seven positive samples. Based on this study, the disposable diaper 
is a suitable method for urine collection of non-toilet-trained children for 
biomonitoring of tebuconazole. This method can serve as a basis for extension to 
other substances of interest.

BACKGROUND: Sit-to-stand (STS) is one of the most common fundamental activity in 
daily life. The pathology of the neuromuscular control system in children with 
spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (SDCP) could contribute to atypical movement 
patterns leading to the inefficiency performance including the STS task. 
However, there was also a lack of evidence about kinematics, kinetics, and 
especially mechanical work during the STS task in children with SDCP aged 7-12 
years old.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What were the differences in mechanical work, kinematics and 
kinetics during STS task between children with SDCP and typically developing 
(TD) children?
METHODS: Eleven children with SDCP (GMFCS I-II) and eleven age and 
gender-matched control TD children with an age range of 7-12 years were 
enrolled. Motion analysis and force plate systems were used to collect data. All 
participants performed the STS task from an adjustable chair. Independent sample 
t-test and two-way analysis of variance were used in this study.
RESULTS: The children with SDCP took a longer time and used more mechanical work 
during STS than TD children. At the beginning of the STS task, children with 
SDCP showed more trunk flexion and posterior pelvic tilting; in addition, during 
the STS task they also presented more trunk, hip, and knee flexion than TD 
children. However, the children with SDCP showed less ankle dorsiflexion 
compared with TD children. For the kinetic variables, asymmetry was found in 
children with SDCP. The maximum hip and knee extension moment, plantar flexion 
moment, and peak vertical ground reaction force (GRF) of the non-dominant leg 
were higher than the values of the dominant leg in these children.
SIGNIFICANCE: Even though, children with SDCP who are able to independently STS. 
They were also a mechanically less efficient performance during STS task. 
Therefore, this task still needs to be trained during rehabilitation sessions.

As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Bristol-Myers 
Squibb) of nivolumab (Opdivo®) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost 
effectiveness for metastatic or unresectable urothelial cancer. Kleijnen 
Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical 
Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG), 
which produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission to NICE. 
Nivolumab was compared with docetaxel, paclitaxel, best supportive care and 
retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine, but 
only for patients whose disease has had an adequate response in first-line 
treatment). Two ongoing, phase I/II, single-arm studies for nivolumab were 
identified, but no studies directly compared nivolumab with any specified 
comparator. Evidence from directly examining the single arms of the trial data 
indicated little difference between the outcomes measured from the nivolumab and 
comparator studies. A simulated treatment comparison (STC) analysis was used in 
an attempt to reduce the bias induced by naïve comparison, but there was no 
clear evidence that risk of bias was reduced. Multiple limitations in the STC 
were identified and remained. The effect of an analysis based on different 
combinations of covariates in the prediction model remains unknown. The ERG's 
concerns regarding the economic analysis included the use of a non-established 
response-based survival analysis method, which introduced additional 
uncertainty. The use of time-dependent hazard ratios produced overfitting and 
was not represented in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The use of a 
treatment stopping rule to cap treatment cost left treatment effectiveness 
unaltered. A relevant comparator was excluded from the base-case analysis. The 
revised ERG deterministic base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based 
on the company's Appraisal Consultation Document response were £58,791, £78,869 
and £62,352 per quality-adjusted life-year gained versus paclitaxel, docetaxel 
and best supportive care, respectively. Nivolumab was dominated by cisplatin 
plus gemcitabine in the ERG base case. Substantial uncertainties about the 
relative treatment effectiveness comparing nivolumab against all comparators 
remained. NICE did not recommend nivolumab, within its marketing authorisation, 
as an option for treating locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing therapy, and 
considered that nivolumab was not suitable for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund.

Objective: To estimate the health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) of adults in 
Zhejiang province and evaluate the health status of the adults. Methods: This 
study was based on the mortality data collected from Zhejiang Chronic Disease 
Surveillance Information and Management System, and mortality rates from the 
underreporting survey and self-reported health data in 2016. Hierarchical 
Ordered Probit (HOPIT) model was used to estimate the severity-weighted 
prevalence of disability. Sullivan's method was used to calculate the HALE. 
Results: After adjustment by HOPIT model, the severity-weighted prevalence of 
disability increased significantly with age (χ(2)=5 795.81,P<0.001), and it was 
higher in females than in males (χ(2)=5 353.27, P<0.001). The life expectancy 
and self-evaluated HALE were 59.08 years and 48.68 years, respectively, in those 
aged ≥20 years, the difference was 10.40 years due to disability. The proportion 
of HALE loss due to disability in the total life expectancy was 17.61%, and it 
increased with age. HALE was higher in males than in females (49.21 years vs. 
48.14 years), and in urban residents than in rural residents (49.92 years vs. 
47.43 years). Conclusion: The proportion of loss of HALE in the total life 
expectancy in adults was high in Zhejiang, and it higher in males than in 
females, in urban residents than rural residents. Programs on improving health 
care in women and rural residents should be promoted.

Purpose: To examine a non-weightbearing exercise program for persons with 
severe peripheral neuropathy (PN) and a diabetic foot ulcer in terms of 
feasibility and safety.Materials and methods: Five men (mean (SD) age of 68.2 
(7.1) years) with diabetes, severe peripheral neuropathy and an active foot 
ulcer, participated in a 10-week exercise program. Program adherence, patient 
satisfaction, healing of foot ulcers, adverse advents, ability to perform 
activities of daily life, and changes in muscle strength were assessed.Results: 
All participants completed the program with a session attendance from 85 to 95%, 
and with high satisfaction (≥9 points on a 10-point numeric rating scale). Only 
minor adverse events occurred, and ulcers were reduced for all participants, 
from a median of 1.9 (IQR, 1.1-7.3) cm2 to 0.0 (0.0-3.0) cm2. The distance on 
stationary bike was improved from a mean (SD) of 3.30 (1.1) to 5.36 (0.5) 
kilometers, and strength training loads were progressed. Ability to perform in 
self-selected activities of daily living improved from a median of 4.3 (2-5) to 
6.7 (5-8) on the Patient Specific Functional Scale (0-10 points), while maximal 
isometric knee-extension muscle strength improved with 23%.Conclusions: A 
non-weightbearing exercise program for people with diabetes, severe peripheral
