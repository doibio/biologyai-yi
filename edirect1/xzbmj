Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
caused by extension of a CAG repeat in the Sca1gene. Although the mechanisms 
underlying the symptoms of SCA1 have not been determined, aberrant neuronal 
activation potentially contributes to the neuronal cell death characteristic of 
the disease. Here we examined the potential involvement of extrasynaptic 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation in the pathogenesis of SCA1 by 
administering memantine, a low-affinity noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist, in SCA1 
knock-in (KI) mice. In KI mice, the exon in the ataxin 1 gene is replaced with 
abnormally expanded 154CAG repeats. Memantine was administered orally to the 
SCA1 KI mice from 4 weeks of age until death. The treatment significantly 
attenuated body-weight loss and prolonged the life span of SCA1 KI mice. 
Furthermore, memantine significantly suppressed the loss of Purkinje cells in 
the cerebellum and motor neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which 
are critical for motor function and parasympathetic function, respectively. 
These findings support the contribution of aberrant activation of extrasynaptic 
NMDARs to neuronal cell death in SCA1 KI mice and suggest that memantine may 
also have therapeutic benefits in human SCA1 patients.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major challenge for 
Latin America (LA), due to its epidemic proportions and high burden to the 
population affected and to public health systems.
METHODS: Our methods have been reported previously: This paper shows the data 
for the last 10 years until 2010, from the Latin American Dialysis and Renal 
Transplantation Registry (RLADTR).
RESULTS: 20 countries participated in the surveys, covering 99% of Latin America 
(LA). The prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) in LA increased from 119 patients per million population (pmp) in 
1991 to 660 pmp in 2010 (hemodialysis (HD) 413 pmp, peritoneal dialysis (PD) 135 
pmp, and LFG 111 pmp). HD proportionally increased more than PD and transplant 
and continues to be the treatment of choice in the region (75%). The kidney 
transplant rate increased from 3.7 pmp in 1987 to 6.9 pmp in 1991 and to 19.1 in 
2010. The total number of transplants in 2010 was 10,397, with 58% being 
deceased donors. The total RRT prevalence correlated positively with gross 
national income (GNI) (r = 0.86; p < 0.05) and life expectancy at birth (r = 
0.58; p < 0.05). The global incidence rate correlated significantly only with 
GNI (r = 0.56; p < 0.05). Diabetes remained the leading cause of ESRD.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence and incidence of RRT continues to increase. In 
countries with 100% public health or insurance coverage for RRT the rates are 
comparable to those displayed by developed countries with better GNI. PD is 
still an underutilized strategy for RRT in the region. Diagnostic and prevention 
programs for hypertension and diabetes, appropriate policies promoting the 
expansion of PD and organ procurement as well as transplantation as cost 
effective forms of RRT are needed in the region.

The widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) among people 
living with HIV in developed countries has lead to significantly improved life 
expectancy. However, extensive use of the effective cART coincides with 
increasing reports of coronary heart disease (CHD) among people living with HIV, 
and CHD has become a major cause of death. CHD results from a complex and 
multifactorial atherosclerotic process involving the over-representation of 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors, particularly smoking, uncontrolled 
viral replication, chronic inflammation, immune activation, and exposure to 
antiretroviral drugs. Consequently careful selection of antiretroviral drugs, 
cardiovascular risk reduction, and lifestyle modifications are needed. In 
individuals living with HIV, cardiovascular risk assessment is becoming an 
important element of care.

BACKGROUND: Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) electrical stimulation therapy 
(EST) has been shown to improve outcome in gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD) patients at 1 year. The aim of this open-label extension trial 
(NCT01578642) was to study the 2-year safety and efficacy of LES-EST in GERD 
patients.
METHODS: GERD patients responsive partially to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with 
off-PPI GERD health-related quality of life (HRQL) of ≥20, 24-hour esophageal pH 
≤4.0 for >5% of the time, hiatal hernia ≤3 cm, and esophagitis LA grade C or 
lower participated in this trial. Bipolar stitch electrodes and a pulse 
generator (EndoStim BV, The Hague, The Netherlands) were implanted 
laparoscopically. LES-EST at 20 Hz, 215 μs, 3-8 mAmp was delivered over 
30-minute sessions, 6-12 sessions per day, starting on day 1 after implantation. 
Patients were evaluated using GERD-HRQL, symptom diaries, Short Form-12, and 
esophageal pH testing at regular intervals. Stimulation sessions were optimized 
based on residual symptoms and esophageal pH at follow-up.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (mean age [SD] = 52 [12] years; 14 men) were 
implanted successfully; 23 patients participated in the 2-year extension trial, 
and 21 completed their 2-year evaluation. At 2 years, there was improvement in 
their median GERD-HRQL on LES-EST compared with both their on-PPI (9 vs 0; P = 
.001) and off-PPI (23.5 vs. 0; P < .001) baseline scores. Median 24-hour distal 
esophageal acid exposure improved from 10% at baseline to 4% (per-protocol 
analysis; P < .001) at 2 years with 71% demonstrating either normalization or a 
≥50% decrease in their distal esophageal acid exposure. All except 5 patients 
(16/21) reported complete cessation of PPI use; only 2 patients were using a PPI 
regularly (≥50% of days). There was significant improvement in sleep quality and 
daily symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation on LES-EST. At baseline, 92% of 
the subjects (22/24) reported that they were "unsatisfied" with their condition 
off-PPI and 71% (17/24) on-PPI compared with 0% (0/21) "unsatisfied" at the 
24-month visits on LES-EST. There were no device- or therapy-related serious 
adverse events and no untoward sensation or dysphagia reported with LES-EST.
CONCLUSION: LES-EST is safe and effective for treating patients with GERD over a 
period of 2 years. LES-EST resulted in a significant and sustained improvement 
in GERD symptoms, and esophageal acid exposure and eliminated PPI use in 
majority of patients (16 of 21). Further, LES-EST was not associated with any 
gastrointestinal side effects or adverse events.

Recalibrating the spirit level: An analysis of the interaction of income 
inequality and poverty and its effect on health.

The publication of The Spirit Level (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009) marked a 
paramount moment in the analysis of health and inequality, quickly attracting a 
remarkable degree of attention, both positive and negative, both in academic and 
in public discourse. Following at least 20 years of research, the book proposes 
a simple and powerful argument: inequality per se, more specifically income 
inequality, is harmful to every aspect of social life. In order to confirm this 
idea, the authors present a series of bivariate, cross-sectional associations 
showing comparisons across countries and within the United States. Despite the 
methodological limitations of this approach, the authors advance causal claims 
concerning the detrimental effects of income inequality. They also rule out 
poverty as a plausible alternative explanation, without directly measuring it. 
Meanwhile, over the last decade stratification scholars have demonstrated the 
nonlinear effect of economic factors, especially income, on health. The results 
suggest that a relative approach is best for analyzing dynamics at the top of 
the income distribution, whereas an absolute approach seems most appropriate for 
studying the bottom of the distribution. Consistent with this perspective, here 
I reanalyze data from The Spirit Level, adding a measure of poverty, in order to 
control the effect of inequality and explore its interaction with poverty. The 
findings show that inequality and poverty-which I contend are two interdependent 
but nonetheless distinct phenomena-interact across countries, such that the 
detrimental effects of inequality are present or stronger in countries with high 
poverty, and absent or weaker in countries with low poverty; poverty replaces 
inequality as the favored explanation of health and social ills across states. 
The new evidence suggests that income distributions are characterized by a 
complex interplay between inequality and poverty, whose interaction deserves 
further analysis.

BACKGROUND: Although depression and chronic pain frequently co-occur, there is a 
lack of clarity in the literature regarding the cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility of antidepressants in the presence of these two conditions. From 
the perspective of healthcare provider, the current study aims to compare the 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of antidepressants in a national cohort of 
depressed patients with and without comorbid pain conditions.
METHODS: Adult patients prescribed with antidepressants for depression were 
identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan 
(n=96,501). By using remission as effectiveness measure and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) as utility measure, the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
were compared across selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants 
(TCAs), as well as by the presence of comorbid painful physical symptoms (PPS).
RESULTS: SSRIs dominated SNRIs in both the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
regardless of comorbid PPS. In comparison with TCAs, SSRIs were likely to be the 
cost-effective option for patients without PPS. In patients with PPS, the 
cost-utility advantage for SSRIs over TCAs varied with threshold 
willingness-to-pay levels. Comorbid PPS may be considered an effect modifier of 
the cost-utility comparisons between SSRIs and TCAs.
CONCLUSIONS: For depressed patients without PPS, SSRIs are likely to be 
cost-effective in improving remission rates and QALYs compared to TCAs and 
SNRIs. However, to improve cost-utility in those with comorbid PPS, people need 
to choose between SSRIs and TCAs according to threshold willingness-to-pay 
levels. Future research is warranted to clarify the impacts of different pain 
conditions on the economic evaluations of pharmacological treatments in patients 
with depression.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of breast cancer in elderly women is limited by declining 
functional status and life expectancy. The impact of providing less aggressive 
treatment remains controversial. This study assessed the treatment patterns of 
elderly breast cancer patients.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of women ≥70 y with breast cancer treated 
between 2004 and 2011 at two large Canadian cancer centres. Tumour and treatment 
characteristics were collected across three subgroups: 70-74 y (n = 314), 75-79 
y (n = 233), and ≥80 y (n = 219). Comparisons were made using Chi-squared test, 
Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test, or ANOVA. Disease free (DFS) and overall (OS) 
survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared by log-rank test.
RESULTS: Women ≥80 y had larger tumours that were better differentiated, hormone 
receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and lymph node (LN)-positive relative to 
younger women (p < 0.05). Women ≥80 y more frequently underwent mastectomy than 
breast conserving surgery and lacked LN staging (p < 0.05). Chemotherapy was 
provided in few patients, especially ≥80 y. Radiation therapy was provided less 
often in women ≥80 y despite indications. Hormone therapy was more frequently 
provided in women ≥80 y. Women ≥80 y had a significantly lower DFS (17.5 m) 
relative to women 70-74 y (31 m, p = 0.02) and 75-79 y (35 m, p = 0.006). Women 
≥80 y had the lowest median OS (53 m) relative to 70-74 y (79 m, p = 0.001) and 
75-79 y (75 m, p = 0.003) women.
CONCLUSIONS: Women ≥80 y received less aggressive treatment than younger women 
and had less favourable DFS and OS. Until age-specific recommendations are 
available physicians must use clinical judgement and assess the tumour biology 
with the patient's comorbidties to make the best choice.

BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopic catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in pediatric 
patients exposes the patients to the potential risk of radiation considering the 
sensitivity of this population and its longer life expectancy. We evaluated the 
feasibility, safety, and efficacy of accessory pathway (AP) ablation guided by 
CARTO3 electroanatomic mapping (EAM) system with both cryoenergy and 
radiofrequency (RF) energy in order to avoid x-ray exposure in pediatric 
patients.
METHODS: We included 44 patients (mean age: 13.1 ± 3.3 years); nine of 44 
presented concealed AP. An electrophysiological study with a three-dimensional 
EAM reconstruction was performed in every patient with a venous transfemoral 
direct right atrium approach or an arterial transfemoral retrograde approach to 
reach the mitral annulus. In two patients with left-sided AP, the ablation was 
performed via a patent foramen ovale.
RESULTS: A total of 47 APs were present, left sided in 45% (21/47) of cases (15 
lateral, one anterior, three posteroseptal, and two posterolateral) and right 
sided in 55% (26/47; one anterior, three anterolateral, one posterolateral, 
three lateral, five para-Hisian, 12 posteroseptal, and one anteroseptal). 
Ablation without the use of fluoroscopy was successfully performed in every 
patient (33 with RF and in 11 with cryoenergy). No complication occurred. At a 
mean follow-up of 16.0 ± 11.7 months, we observed seven recurrences, three of 
them successfully re-ablated without fluoroscopy. In one case cryoablation of a 
para-Hisian AP was ineffective in the long term.
CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional EAM allowed a safe and effective fluoroless AP 
ablation procedure in a pediatric population both with RF and cryoenergy.

Consumption of deep sea minerals (DSM), such as magnesium, calcium, and 
potassium, is known to reduce hypercholesterolemia-induced myocardial 
hypertrophy and cardiac-apoptosis and provide protection against cardiovascular 
diseases. Heart diseases develop as a lethal complication among diabetic 
patients usually due to hyperglycemia-induced cardiac-apoptosis that causes 
severe cardiac-damages, heart failure, and reduced life expectancy. In this 
study, we investigated the potential of DSM and its related cardio-protection to 
increase the life expectancy in diabetic rats. In this study, a heart failure 
rat model was developed by using streptozotocin (65 mg kg(-1) ) IP injection. 
Different doses of DSM-1× (37 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ), 2× (74 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) 
and 3× (111 mg kg(-1) day(-1) ), were administered to the rats through gavages 
for 4 weeks. The positive effects of DSM on the survival rate of diabetes rats 
were determined with respect to the corresponding effects of MgSO4 . Further, to 
understand the mechanism by which DSM enhances the survival of diabetic rats, 
their potential to regulate cardiac-apoptosis and control cardiac-dysfunction 
were examined. Echocardiogram, tissue staining, TUNEL assay, and Western 
blotting assay were used to investigate modulations in the myocardial 
contractile function and related signaling protein expression. The results 
showed that DSM regulate apoptosis and complement the cardiomyocyte 
proliferation by enhancing survival mechanisms. Moreover DSM significantly 
reduced the mortality rate and enhanced the survival rate of diabetic rats. 
Experimental results show that DSM administration can be an effective strategy 
to improve the life expectancy of diabetic subjects by improving cardiac-cell 
proliferation and by controlling cardiac-apoptosis and associated 
cardiac-dysfunction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 31: 769-781,

BACKGROUND: Haemoglobinopathies are a major public health problem in Sicily: it 
was estimated a frequency of 1/245 couples are at risk of haemoglobinopathies. 
This paper reviews legislative actions, prevention activities, carrier 
screening, genetic counselling, foetal sampling and laboratory methodology 
analysis evolution reporting the results of 30 years of prevention actions to 
assess the efficiency of our preventative programme in the control of 
haemoglobinopathies in Sicily.
METHODS: This programme consisted principally of five phases: legislative 
actions, public awareness campaign, carrier screening, genetic counselling and 
prenatal diagnosis.
RESULTS: These programmes have been very effective, which we can see from a 
greater public awareness of thalassaemia and its prevention in the target 
population furthermore by a marked decline in the incidence of thalassaemia 
major and sickle cell anaemia from 1 in 245 live births in the absence of 
prevention to 1 in 2000, with a reduction in about 85%. The residual cases were 
because of a conscious choice by expecting parents in relation to improved life 
expectancy as well as improved quality of life of the affected patients.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that public health authorities should act and 
invest in a similar programme for prevention of thalassaemia, as well as in 
relation to the increased survival of patients and the consequent organ 
complications.

Both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia may be related to heart failure (HF) therapy 
and are associated with adverse outcomes. Abnormalities in serum potassium 
levels in hospitalized patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF) have 
not been previously investigated. A post hoc analysis was performed in 1,907 
hospitalized patients with worsening HF and reduced EF in the placebo arm of the 
Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in HF Outcome Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST) 
trial. Serum potassium was measured at randomization and at discharge or day 7. 
The co-primary end points were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiovascular 
mortality or the first HF hospitalization (CVM + HFH). The association between 
inhospital change in potassium levels and time to outcomes was evaluated using 
multivariate Cox regression models. Study participants had a mean age of 65.6 ± 
12.0 years and were on optimal guideline-directed medical therapies, including β 
blockers (77%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 
blockers (85%), and aldosterone antagonists (55%). Baseline potassium 
concentration was 4.3 ± 0.6 mEq/l, and hyperkalemia or hypokalemia was seen in 
6.5% of the participants. On average, serum potassium level increased by 0.21 ± 
0.66 mEq/l, p <0.0001, during hospitalization. Inhospital potassium change was 
not associated with either the primary or the secondary end point over a median 
follow-up of 9.9 months. In conclusion, in patients with reduced EF hospitalized 
for worsening HF, serum potassium abnormalities are common at baseline (within 
48 hours of admission) and potassium levels increase during hospitalization, 
despite aggressive diuretic therapy. However, they are not associated with 
all-cause or CVM or HFH. Inhospital changes in potassium may limit the 
implementation of evidence-based therapies such as mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists.

The aims of this study were to determine if dental colleges are clustered in 
selective states in India and if population to dental college admissions (seats) 
is correlated with regional health, economic, and human development in that 
country. There are 29 states and seven union territories in India, with 301 
dental colleges. This study used publicly available data from the Dental Council 
of India, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Ministry of Health and 
Family Welfare, and Institute of Applied Manpower Research of the Government of 
India. Non-parametric tests were used to test for associations. In academic year 
2013-14, a total of 293 approved and recognized colleges were in existence, and 
a total of 23,780 seats were available in all dental colleges. Close to 54% of 
all dental colleges and 55% of all dental college seats were clustered in five 
states. The mean population per dental college seat was 94,324 (median was 
46,898, and range was a minimum of 2,432 to a maximum of 780,139). The 
population to one dental college seat decreased significantly as the health and 
human development index increased (p<0.05). The results showed that dental 
colleges are clustered in a few states, leaving multiple states in India with no 
dental colleges. Dental colleges appear to be located in states with high 
health, economic, and human development indices, thus doing little to address 
the imbalance in dentist to population ratios in states that are disadvantaged 
in terms of health, economics, and human development.

INTRODUCTION: Acute thrombus removal therapies may reduce post-thrombotic 
syndrome in certain deep venous thrombosis patients. The LET classification is 
designed to identify patients at high risk for developing post-thrombotic 
syndrome in the acute phase using thrombus location and extent. This study 
evaluates the use of the LET classification to predict post-thrombotic syndrome 
in a cohort of patients after deep venous thrombosis.
METHODS: A cohort of 660 deep venous thrombosis patients was invited to 
participate and fill out a questionnaire with Quality of life questionnaires, 
basic information, a modified self-assessment version of the Villalta scale for 
post-thrombotic syndrome and potential confounders. Original data on thrombus 
extension was available, and the LET classes were determined. Obtained 
information was analysed using ANOVA and in a multiple logistic regression model 
to correct for confounders. All different LET classes were compared to 
post-thrombotic syndrome occurrence, post-thrombotic syndrome prediction and 
disease specific quality of life scores (VEINES-Sym/Qol).
RESULTS: Three hundred and fifteen patients responded, and in 309 a 
post-thrombotic syndrome score was distilled. LET I,II,III (n = 63) had an odds 
ratio of 3.4(1.2-9.2) for predicting severe post-thrombotic syndrome, and LET II 
(n = 17) had an odds ratio of 5.1(1.3-20.8) compared to LET class I (n = 97). 
Both the VEINES-Sym and VEINES-Qol score were significantly lower for LET 
I,II,III compared to LET I, and LET II compared to LET I.
CONCLUSION: The LET classification can be used to classify patients according to 
acute thrombus location and extent. Extensive and centrally located (LET 
I,II,III) deep venous thrombosis showed the highest probability in developing 
severe post-thrombotic syndrome and lower disease specific quality of life.

Therapeutic application of neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis for 
neurodegenerative disorders: regeneration and beyond.

With the growth of the aging population and increasing life expectancy, the 
diagnosis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is predicted to increase 12% 
by 2030. There is urgent need to develop better and novel treatments for 
disorders like Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. As these 
neurodegenerative diseases are customarily defined by the progressive loss of 
neurons, treatment strategies have traditionally focused on replacing neurons 
lost during disease progression. To this end, the self-renewing and multipotent 
properties of neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) that exist in the adult brain 
suggest that NSPCs could contribute to a therapy for replacement of damaged or 
lost neurons. Although a wealth of research demonstrates the proof-of-concept 
that NSPC transplantation has therapeutic potential, there are considerable 
barriers between the theory of cell transplantation and clinical implementation. 
However, a new view on harnessing the power of NSPC for treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders has emerged, and focuses on treating 
neuropathological aspects of the disease prior to the appearance of overt 
neuronal loss. For example, rather than merely replacing lost neurons, NSPCs are 
now being considered for their ability to provide trophic support. Here we 
review the evolution of how the field has considered application of NSPCs for 
treatment of neurodegeneration disorders. We discuss the challenges posed by the 
"traditional" view of neurodegeneration - overt cell loss - for utilization of 
NSPCs for treatment of these disorders. We also review the emergence of an 
alternative strategy that involves fine-tuning the neurogenic capacity of 
existing adult NSPCs so that they are engineered to address disease-specific 
pathologies at specific time points during the trajectory of disease. We 
conclude with our opinion that for this strategy to become a translational 
reality, it requires a thorough understanding of NSPCs, the dynamic process of 
adult neurogenesis, and a better understanding of the pathological trajectory of 
each neurodegenerative disease.

stress urinary incontinence.

Gynecology, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Baltimore, MD; §The Ohio State 
University, Columbus, OH; and ║Alpert Medical School at Brown University, 
Providence, RI.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the cost utility of urethral 
bulking agents (BA) compared with midurethral slings (MUS) in the treatment of 
stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in patients without urethral hypermobility.
METHODS: A decision tree was constructed to compare the cost utility of urethral 
BA versus MUS in the setting of SUI without urethral hypermobility. Probability 
estimates for success, failure, and complications were obtained from the 
published literature. Immediate-term, short-term, and longer-term complications 
were accounted for over a 1-year time horizon in the model. One-way and 2-way 
sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the 
robustness of our results.
RESULTS: Our model demonstrated that MUS cost $436,465 more than BA for every 
100 women treated in 1 year. Using MUS compared with BA leads to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $70,400 per utility gained. Assuming a willingness 
to pay of $50,000, this makes MUS not cost-effective as a first-line treatment 
in many situations. When MUS costs less than $5132, it becomes a cost-effective 
first-line treatment, and when it costs less than $2035, it is cost saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Bulking agents are more cost-effective than MUS over a 1-year time 
horizon in the treatment of SUI in patients without urethral hypermobility. In 
women who lack urethral hypermobility, BA remain a cost-effective option in this 
patient population.

[The polymorphism of DNA repair genes XPD, XRCC1, OGG1, and ERCC6, life 
expectancy, and the inclination to smoke].

[Article in Russian]

Romaniuk OP, Nikitchenko NV, Savina NV, Kuzhir TD, Goncharova RI.

The polymorphism of excision repair genes XPD Asp312Asn, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, OGG1 
Ser326Cys, and ERCC6 Met1097Val was analyzed by PCR-RFLP in 370 representatives 
of the Belarusian population of average, old, and elderly ages. Correlation 
analysis showed that the frequencies of wild-type homozygous combinations 
significantly increase with age in the group of subjects over 70 years old in 
the case of the interaction of two genes, XPD 312 and XRCC1399, or three genes, 
XPD312, XRCC1399, and ERCC6 1097. In a subgroup of the long-lived, this 
relationship is manifested in case of a pairwise interaction of gene XPD 312 
with XRCC1 399 or ERCC6 1097, as well as an interaction of three genes, XPD 312, 
XRCC1 399, and ERCC6 1097. The data suggest that the optimum activity of repair 
processes may favor longevity. It is shown that the frequency of the Asp/Asp 
genotype is reduced, and the frequency of the Asn allele of the XPD 312 gene is 
increased in the subgroup of smokers as compared with nonsmokers, which 
apparently indicates an association of this gene polymorphism with an 
inclination to smoke. The problem requires further study.

Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs), as a recent transduction technology, 
harvest electrical energy by scavenging mechanical energy from diverse sources. 
Their performance is affected by various material properties and failure modes 
of the dielectric elastomers. This work presents a theoretical analysis on the 
performance of a dielectric elastomer membrane generator under equi-biaxial 
loading conditions. By comparing our simulation results with the experimental 
observations existing in the literature, this work considers the fatigue life of 
DE-based devices under cyclic loading for the first time. From the simulation 
results, it is concluded that the efficiency of the DEG can be improved by 
raising the deforming rate and the prescribed maximum stretch ratio, and 
applying an appropriate bias voltage. However, the fatigue life expectancy 
compromises the efficiency improvement of the DEG. With the consideration of the 
fatigue life, applying an appropriate bias voltage appears to be a more 
desirable way to improve the DEG performance. The general framework developed in 
this work is expected to provide an increased understanding on the energy 
harvesting mechanisms of the DEGs and benefit their optimal design.

The incidence of glioblastoma increases with age, with a median age, at 
diagnosis, of 65 years. Indeed, the optimization of standard of care of elderly 
glioblastoma patients in an aging population in Western countries becomes 
crucial. The age remains the main prognostic factor of glioblastoma. Survival 
among elderly patients is significantly less than among younger patients. The 
median survival of elderly glioblastoma patients is generally inferior to 6 
months. More aggressive tumor behavior, less aggressive treatments, increased 
toxicity of therapies and more unfavorable clinical factors and comorbidities 
could explain a higher severity of the disease in the elderly. The balance 
between treatment efficacy and quality of life is a major focus because of the 
shorter life expectancy of patients. The standard of care of glioblastoma in 
elderly patients remains controversial. Large optimal resection, when 
achievable, should be preferred to biopsy. Survival is longer after adjuvant 
radiotherapy, either normofractionated over 6-weeks course or hypofractionated 
over 3-weeks course, for patients with good clinical status. Hypofractionation 
is often preferred because of shorter procedure. Chemotherapy alone with 
temozolomide can be proposed to patients with methylated MGMT promoter. A phase 
III randomized study, testing short-course adjuvant radiotherapy with or without 
temozolomide in elderly patients with good clinical status, is ongoing.

There is evidence that multiple stable equilibrium states are possible in 
real-life ecological systems. Phenomenological mathematical models which exhibit 
such properties can be constructed rather straightforwardly. For instance, for a 
predator-prey system this result can be achieved through the use of 
non-monotonic functional response for the predator. However, while formal 
formulation of such a model is not a problem, the biological justification for 
such functional responses and models is usually inconclusive. In this note, we 
explore a conjecture that a multitude of equilibrium states can be caused by an 
adaptation of animal behaviour to changes of environmental conditions. In order 
to verify this hypothesis, we consider a simple predator-prey model, which is a 
straightforward extension of the classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. In 
this model, we made an intuitively transparent assumption that the prey can 
change a mode of behaviour in response to the pressure of predation, choosing 
either "safe" of "risky" (or "business as usual") behaviour. In order to avoid a 
situation where one of the modes gives an absolute advantage, we introduce the 
concept of the "cost of a policy" into the model. A simple conceptual 
two-dimensional predator-prey model, which is minimal with this property, and is 
not relying on odd functional responses, higher dimensionality or behaviour 
change for the predator, exhibits two stable co-existing equilibrium states with 
basins of attraction separated by a separatrix of a saddle point.

Despite sharp increases in spending on cancer treatment since 1970 in the United 
States compared to Western Europe, US cancer mortality rates have decreased only 
modestly. This has raised questions about the additional value of US cancer care 
derived from this additional spending. We calculated the number of US cancer 
deaths averted, compared to the situation in Western Europe, between 1982 and 
2010 for twelve cancer types. We also assessed the value of US cancer care, 
compared to that in Western Europe, by estimating the ratio of additional 
spending on cancer to the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. Compared 
to Western Europe, for three of the four costliest US cancers-breast, 
colorectal, and prostate-there were approximately 67,000, 265,000, and 60,000 
averted US deaths, respectively, and for lung cancer there were roughly 
1,120,000 excess deaths in the study period. The ratio of incremental cost to 
quality-adjusted life-years saved equaled $402,000 for breast cancer, $110,000 
for colorectal cancer, and $1,979,000 for prostate cancer-amounts that exceed 
most accepted thresholds for cost-effective medical care. The United States lost 
quality-adjusted life-years despite additional spending for lung cancer: 
-$19,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Our results suggest that cancer 
care in the United States may provide less value than corresponding cancer care 
in Western Europe for many leading cancers.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Jordan after cardiovascular 
diseases. Due to increase in life expectancy and prolonged exposure to risk 
factors, cancer mortality and morbidity are expected to increase as the young 
population ages. This increase will constitute a challenging burden on 
healthcare systems in Jordan and many other neighboring countries. Planning is 
key to managing the expected rise in the demand for cancer care, and this will 
require public health initiatives to guarantee access to quality cancer care. 
Over the past decade, cancer care in Jordan has witnessed remarkable improvement 
through access to advanced diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we 
address the history of cancer care in Jordan, including cancer statistics, 
infrastructure, workforce as well as cancer care outcomes. We also discuss many 
of the challenges that we face and offer suggestions for the improvement of 
cancer management in Jordan and the region.

Bovine anaplasmosis is an infectious, non-contagious disease caused by the 
rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma marginale (A. marginale). The organism has a 
global distribution and infects erythrocytes, resulting in anemia, jaundice, 
fever, abortions and death. Once infected, animals remain carriers for life. The 
carrier status provides immunity to clinical disease, but is problematic if
