Afforestation is an effective method to increase carbon (C) sinks and address 
climate change. It is crucial to understand how the stand growth affects C 
sequestration capacity, especially when the trade-offs with timber production 
from plantations have not been fully examined. We used a chronosequence approach 
to estimate C storage in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) 
plantations (including the trees, understory, litter, and soils) at seven stand 
ages (3, 8-11, 16, 21, 25, 29, and 32 years). Ecosystem C storage increased 
nonlinearly from 76.4 to 282.2 t ha-1 with stand age and was fitted with a 
logistic model that had a maximum C storage and age of 271.9 t ha-1 and 33 
years, respectively, to reach 95% of the maximum stored C. The C increment was 
mainly contributed by an increase in tree biomass, which ranged from 2.8 to 
177.7 t ha-1 and comprised 4-64% of the total ecosystem C. Live root C (sum of 
the stump, coarse, and fine root C) showed a logistic increase from 2.0 to 
26.3 t ha-1 with stand age and constituted 2.5-9.3% of ecosystem C. Understory 
plants and litter represented a small pool (<2% of ecosystem C). The C storage 
in shrubs and litter slightly increased, while that in herbs decreased as the 
stands aged. Soil C storage was an important and relatively stable pool, ranging 
from 69.6 to 130.1 t ha-1. Stand volume was also best fitted with a logistic 
model with a maximum value of 552.6 m3 ha-1. Additionally, the time needed to 
reach 95% of the maximum volume was 25 years. Hence, extending the rotation age 
to over 30 years for Chinese fir plantations could potentially maximize the 
synergistic benefits of C storage to mitigate climate change and obtain timber 
products for economic profit.

AIM: Tamoxifen-mediated endocrine therapy has been standard treatment for ER+ 
breast cancers; however, majority of them acquire resistance leading to disease 
relapse. Although numerous substrates of E3 ligase FBW7 are known, only a 
handful of factors that regulate FBW7 expression and function are reported. In 
particular, there remains a lack of in-depth understanding of FBW7 
transcriptional regulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Luciferase reporter assay was performed after cloning 
full length and truncated FBW7 promoters followed by Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assay to validate binding of SOX4 on FBW7 promoter. 
Transcriptional regulation of FBW7 by SOX4 and their biological consequences 
with respect to ER+ breast cancer was then evaluated using immunoblotting and 
other cell based assays.
KEY FINDINGS: SOX4 positively regulates FBW7 at transcriptional level by binding 
to three putative SOX4 biding sites within 3.1 kb long FBW7 promoter. Analysis 
of publicly available RNAseq datasets also showed a positive correlation between 
SOX4 and FBW7 mRNA in cancer cell lines and patient samples. qPCR and 
Immunoblotting confirmed that transiently or stably expressed SOX4 induced both 
endogenous FBW7 mRNA and protein levels. Our findings further demonstrated that 
increased levels of SOX4 and FBW7 in MCF7 mammospheres promoted cancer stemness 
and tumor cell dormancy. We further showed that both MCF7 mammospheres and 
MCFTAMR cells had elevated SOX4 levels which apparently enhanced FBW7 to 
potentiate GATA3 degradation leading to enhanced stemness, tumor dormancy and 
Tamoxifen resistance in MCF7TAMR as well as patients with ER+ breast cancers.
SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting SOX4-FBW7-GATA3 axis may overcome tamoxifen resistance 
in ER+ breast cancers.

AIM: Magnesium supplementation may extend the life span; however, the biological 
mechanism is still unknown. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a marker of cell 
aging and biological health in humans. Data concerning whether magnesium 
supplementation can maintain telomere length, thus prolonging life are limited. 
We aimed to investigate the association between dietary magnesium intake and LTL 
in United States middle-aged and elderly adults.
METHODS: A total of 4,039 United States adults aged ≥ 45 years from National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002). Dietary magnesium intake 
was collected by a trained interviewer using 24-h dietary recall method and LTL 
was obtained using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Multiple 
linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the crude and adjusted 
association of dietary magnesium intake with LTL.
RESULTS: The overall mean (SD) of LTL was 5.6 (0.6) kp. After adjusting 
potential confounders, every 1 mg increase in log-transformed dietary magnesium 
intake was associated with 0.20 kp (95% confidence intervals: 0.05-0.34) longer 
LTL. Participants with the highest tertile (≥299 mg) of dietary magnesium intake 
had statistically significant longer LTL (β = 0.07, P = 0.038) compared with the 
lowest tertile (<198 mg), with significant linear trends across tertiles. 
Moreover, the association between dietary magnesium intake and LTL was 
significantly stronger in participants with higher levels of education (≥high 
school compared with < high school, P for interaction = 0.002). E-value analysis 
suggested robustness to unmeasured confounding.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that increased dietary magnesium intake was 
associated with longer LTL, which suggested that magnesium was conducive to a 
longer life expectancy.

Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of human copper metabolism, 
with an estimated prevalence of 1:30000-1:50000 and a broad spectrum of hepatic 
and neuropsychiatric manifestations. In healthy individuals, the bile is the 
main route of elimination of copper. In WD patients, copper accumulates in the 
liver, it is released into the bloodstream, and is excreted in urine. Copper can 
also be accumulated in the brain, kidneys, heart, and osseous matter and causes 
damage due to direct toxicity or oxidative stress. Hepatic WD is commonly but 
not exclusively diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood. Adherent, 
non-cirrhotic WD patients seem to have a normal life expectancy. Nevertheless, 
chronic management of patients with Wilson's disease is challenging, as 
available biochemical tests have many limitations and do not allow a clear 
identification of non-compliance, overtreatment, or treatment goals. To provide 
optimal care, clinicians should have a complete understanding of these 
limitations and counterbalance them with a thorough clinical assessment. The aim 
of this review is to provide clinicians with practical tools and suggestions 
which may answer doubts that can arise during chronic management of patients 
with hepatic WD. In particular, it summarises current knowledge on Wilson's 
disease clinical and biochemical monitoring and treatment. It also analyses 
available evidence on pregnancy and the role of low-copper diet in WD. Future 
research should focus on trying to provide new copper metabolism tests which 
could help to guide treatment adjustments.

The improvements in healthcare services and quality of life result in a longer 
life expectancy and a higher number of aged individuals, who are inevitably 
affected by age-associated cardiovascular (CV) diseases. This challenging 
demographic shift calls for a greater effort to unravel the molecular mechanisms 
underlying age-related CV diseases to identify new therapeutic targets to cope 
with the ongoing aging "pandemic". Essential for protection against external 
pathogens and intrinsic degenerative processes, the inflammatory response 
becomes dysregulated with aging, leading to a persistent state of low-grade 
inflammation known as inflamm-aging. Of interest, inflammation has been recently 
recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of CV diseases, suggesting 
inflamm-aging as a possible driver of age-related CV afflictions and a plausible 
therapeutic target in this context. This review discusses the molecular pathways 
underlying inflamm-aging and their involvement in CV disease. Moreover, the 
potential of several anti-inflammatory approaches in this context is also 
reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Temperature-controlled radiofrequency neurolysis of the posterior 
nasal nerve has been shown to reduce the symptom burden of patients with chronic 
rhinitis.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of 
temperature-controlled radiofrequency neurolysis of the posterior nasal nerve 
for the treatment of chronic rhinitis.
METHODS: A prospective extension of a 12-month single-arm study, where 
reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) and the responses to a 
study-specific quality of life questionnaire and patient satisfaction survey 
were collected at 24 months.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients completed initial 12-month follow-up after 
treatment with the study device, of which 34 patients were reconsented and 
completed 24-month follow-up. The mean rTNSS of the long-term follow-up patients 
improved from 8.4 (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.7 to 9.0) at baseline to 2.9 
(95% CI, 2.1 to 3.6), P < .001 at 24 months, a 65.5% improvement. On a 6-point 
scale (0-5), postnasal drip improved from a mean of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.6 to 4.6) to 
2.1 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.5) and chronic cough improved from 3.2 (95% CI, 2.7 to 
3.6) to 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.3) from baseline through 24 months; P < .001 for 
both measures. The proportion of patients achieving a minimal clinically 
important difference of 30% improvement from baseline at 24 months was 88.2% 
(95% CI, 73.4%-95.3%). At 24 months, 24% of patients were taking overall fewer 
and 15% taking overall more rhinitis medication classes than at baseline. 
Patients reported a higher quality of life in terms of sleep, well-being, and 
lower oral medication/nasal spray use at 24 months. There were no serious 
adverse events considered related to the procedure in the 12-24-month period.
CONCLUSION: Temperature-controlled radiofrequency neurolysis results in a 
significant and durable reduction in the symptom burden of chronic rhinitis and 
patients reported improved quality of life through 24 months postprocedure.

Overall progress in life expectancy (LE) depends increasingly on survival in 
older ages. The birth cohorts now reaching old age have experienced considerable 
educational expansion, which is a driving force for the social change and social 
inequality. Thus, this study examines changes in old age LE by educational 
attainment in the Nordic countries and aims to find out to what extent the 
change in national LEs is attributable to education-specific mortality and the 
shifting educational composition. We used national register data comprising 
total 65 + populations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden to create period 
life tables stratified by five-year age groups (65-90 +), sex and educational 
attainment. Difference in LE between 2001 and 2015 was decomposed into the 
contributions of mortality changes within each educational group and changes in 
educational composition. Increasing LE at all ages and in all educational groups 
coincided with persistent and growing educational inequalities in all countries. 
Most of the gains in LE at age 65 could be attributed to decreased mortality 
(63-90%), especially among those with low education, the largest educational 
group in most countries. The proportion of the increase in LE attributable to 
improved education was 10-37%, with the highest contributions recorded for women 
in Norway and Sweden. The rising educational levels in the Nordic countries 
still carry potential for further gains in national LEs. However, the 
educational expansion has contributed to uneven gains in LE between education 
groups, which poses a risk for the future increase of inequalities in LE.

The era of geriatric surgery has arrived with increased global life expectancy. 
The need to optimize outcomes in this group of patients goes beyond traditional 
outcomes such as postoperative morbidity and mortality indicators. Recognizing 
risk factors that impact adverse surgical outcomes such as frailty and 
sarcopenia, individualizing optimization strategies such as prehabilitation and 
a multidisciplinary geriatric surgical service have been shown to improve 
postoperative outcomes and help the older surgical patient regain premorbid 
function and maintain quality of life. There needs to be a concerted effort to 
increase awareness of this increasingly important topic in practicing surgeons 
around the world to meet the challenges of the aging population.

INTRODUCTION: Improvement in life expectancy has increased the number of very 
elderly patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, it is not clear which quality 
measures for hemodialysis should be employed in this population. Therefore, in 
this paper we investigated the association between major adverse cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) indicators of hemodialysis quality in very 
elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data regarding a total of 29,692 
patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (median age 61 years, 41.5% 
females) who participated in a national hemodialysis quality assessment program 
were analyzed. They were divided into < 80 years and ≥ 80 years age groups. The 
primary and secondary outcomes were MACCE and all-cause mortality, respectively. 
The association between the outcomes and some of the most widely used 
standard hemodialysis quality-of-care indicators, including spKt/V, hemoglobin, 
serum calcium, serum phosphate, and albumin levels, was evaluated. To explore 
the association between Cox proportional hazard models were constructed. Model 1 
was adjusted for age and sex. Model 2 included additional demographic 
characteristics, such as Charlson Comorbidity Index (excluding diabetes), 
diabetes, cause of ESKD, dialysis vintage, BMI, and pre-dialysis systolic blood 
pressure. Model 3 was further adjusted for the main medications. To evaluate the 
relationship between MACCE risk and quality assessment indicators as a 
continuous variable, cubic spline analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, MACCE occurred at a higher rate 
in the ≥ 80-years group than in the < 80-years group (282.0 vs. 110.1 
events/1000 person-years). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that 
spKt/V, serum calcium and phosphate, and hemoglobin levels were associated with 
MACCE and all-cause mortality risk in patients aged < 80 years. However, these 
indicators showed no significant relationship with MACCE and all-cause mortality 
in patients aged ≥ 80 years. Low serum albumin levels were significantly 
associated with increased MACCE and all-cause mortality risks, regardless of 
age.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, hemodialysis quality-of-care indicators including 
spKt/V, serum calcium and phosphate levels, and hemoglobin were not related to 
MACCE or all-cause mortality in very elderly hemodialysis patients. However, 
lower serum albumin levels were associated with poor outcomes, regardless of 
patient age. Assuring nutritional status rather than improving hemodialysis 
management adequacy may be more beneficial for improving outcomes in very 
elderly hemodialysis patients. Further prospective evaluations are needed to 
confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Strokes are common in people with atrial fibrillation (AF), and can 
have devastating consequences, especially in the elderly and if AF is untreated. 
However, community-based studies on screening for untreated AF have not been 
conducted in Japan, and there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of 
early screening for AF in the elderly (≥65 years).
METHODS: The Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (KPUM) Education 
Initiative has conducted an AF awareness campaign consisted of screening tests 
using a blood pressure (BP) monitor with electrocardiogram (ECG) (the Complete, 
Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and educational lectures for the 
elderly (≥65 years) from 2019 to 2020. A modeled effectiveness analysis was 
performed comparing the life-years and QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years) 
between direct-acting oral anticoagulation (DOAC)-treated AF and untreated AF in 
a Japanese setting. The basic description of the Markov model was used for the 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1648 participants were screened, and after excluding those 
with missing information or data (n = 41), 1607 were finally enrolled. The mean 
(± standard deviation) age of participants was 72.4±5.8 years, 827 (51.5%) were 
female, 628 (39.1%) had hypertension, and 1368 (85.1%) had CHA2DS2-VASc score 
≥2. After cardiologists' evaluation of all ECG recordings of the Complete, 15 
(0.93%) AF were newly detected. For each AF treated with DOAC, 0.859 QALYs 
gained over the lifetime for 65 years-old men, and 0.856 QALYs for 65 years-old 
women compared to non-treatment.
CONCLUSION: A moderate number of untreated AF were identified in the 
community-based study. Identification of an increased number of patients with 
AF, if properly treated with DOAC, ultimately leads to a reduction in the number 
of strokes occurred over subjects' lifetime.

In March 2020, the first version of EPIVIGILA was deployed in a productive 
environment a few days after the first local case of COVID- 19. This system is a 
technological integration plat-form for national epidemiological surveillance of 
notifiable diseases. Previously, Chile used a manual process that would probably 
have failed with a peak volume of more than 38 000 daily notifications; in a 
country with 18 million inhabitants, long and narrow geography, and centralized 
governance. This work highlights the importance of the national electronic 
surveillance system EPIVIGILA in managing the pandemic. The systems main 
strength is its ability to adapt to the needs of reliable, precise, timely, and 
real- time information. EPIVIGILA was able to include, under the circumstances, 
different flows, actors, data, and functionalities with high expectations of 
accuracy. This valuable information allowed the authorities to assess the impact 
of the measures to manage and control the pandemic. Its versatility positions 
this platform among the few globally that operates national data with a high 
level of granularity in a single system through a pandemic. In Chile, EPIVIGILA 
is the primary source of information for daily reports, epidemiological reports, 
and data published on government websites about COVID- 19. Thus, electronic 
systems prove fundamental for public health because the recording and processing 
of data generate clear, reliable, and timely information, helping authorities 
make decisions to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, prevent deaths, and 
improve the populations quality of life.

Publisher: En marzo 2020 se despliega la primera versión de EPIVIGILA en un 
ambiente productivo, plataforma de integración tecnológica de vigilancia 
epidemiológica nacional para enfermedades de notificación obligatoria (a pocos 
días del caso 1 de COVID- 19 local). Anteriormente, Chile usaba un proceso 
manual que probablemente hubiese fracasado ante un volumen máximo superior a 38 
000 notificaciones diarias, en un país con 18 millones de habitantes, de 
geografía larga y angosta y gobernanza centralizada. El objetivo del trabajo es 
relevar la importancia que tiene en el manejo de la pandemia el sistema nacional 
de vigilancia electrónico EPIVIGILA. La principal fortaleza del sistema es su 
capacidad de adaptación a las necesidades de información fidedigna, precisa, 
oportuna y en tiempo real. EPIVIGILA fue capaz de incluir, en el curso de las 
circunstancias, distintos flujos, actores, datos y funcionalidades con altas 
expectativas de exactitud. Ello permitió que las autoridades pudieran evaluar el 
impacto de las medidas implementadas para el manejo y control de la pandemia. Su 
versatilidad posiciona a esta plataforma entre las pocas en el mundo que opera 
datos nacionales en una pandemia con un alto nivel de granularidad en un único 
sistema. En Chile, EPIVIGILA es la principal fuente de información para los 
reportes diarios, informes epidemiológicos y datos publicados en sitios web 
gubernamentales sobre COVID- 19. Así, el uso de sistemas electrónicos muestran 
ser un soporte fundamental para la salud pública, porque el registro y 
procesamiento de los datos genera información clara, confiable y oportuna, 
contribuyendo a que las autoridades puedan tomar decisiones orientadas a 
disminuir la propagación de enfermedades transmisibles, evitar muertes y mejorar 
la calidad de vida de la población.

To determine the survival benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (allo-HCT) in chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML), we 
assembled a retrospective cohort of CMML patients 18-70 years old diagnosed 
between 2000 and 2014 from an international CMML dataset (n = 730) and the EBMT 
registry (n = 384). The prognostic impact of allo-HCT was analyzed through 
univariable and multivariable time-dependent models and with a multistate model, 
accounting for age, sex, CMML prognostic scoring system (low or intermediate-1 
grouped as lower-risk, intermediate-2 or high as higher-risk) at diagnosis, and 
AML transformation. In univariable analysis, lower-risk CMMLs had a 5-year 
overall survival (OS) of 20% with allo-HCT vs 42% without allo-HCT (P < .001). 
In higher-risk patients, 5-year OS was 27% with allo-HCT vs 15% without allo-HCT 
(P = .13). With multistate models, performing allo-HCT before AML transformation 
reduced OS in patients with lower-risk CMML, and a survival benefit was 
predicted for men with higher-risk CMML. In a multivariable analysis of 
lower-risk patients, performing allo-HCT before transformation to AML 
significantly increased the risk of death within 2 years of transplantation 
(hazard ratio [HR], 3.19; P < .001), with no significant change in long-term 
survival beyond this time point (HR, 0.98; P = .92). In higher-risk patients, 
allo-HCT significantly increased the risk of death in the first 2 years after 
transplant (HR 1.46; P = .01) but not beyond (HR, 0.60; P = .09). Performing 
allo-HCT before AML transformation decreases life expectancy in lower-risk 
patients but may be considered in higher-risk patients.

PURPOSE: Despite increasing utilization of SABR for oligometastatic cancer, 
prospective outcomes are lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine 
progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), and prognostic factors from 
the population-based phase 2 SABR-5 trial.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The SABR-5 trial was a single-arm phase 2 study with the 
primary endpoint of toxicity, conducted at the 6 regional cancer centers across 
British Columbia (BC), Canada, during which time SABR for oligometastases was 
only offered on trial. Patients with up to 5 oligometastases (total or not 
controlled by prior treatment and including induced oligometastatic disease) 
underwent SABR to all lesions. Patients were 18 years of age or older, had an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0 to 2, and had life expectancy ≥ 6 
months. The secondary outcomes of PFS and LC are presented here.
RESULTS: Between November 2016 and July 2020, 381 patients underwent SABR on 
trial. Median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 18-36). Median PFS 
was 15 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12-18). LC at 1 and 3 years were 
93% (95% CI, 91-95) and 87% (95% CI, 84-90), respectively. On multivariable 
analysis, increasing tumor diameter (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; P < .001), 
declining performance status (HR, 2.13; P < .001), disease-free interval <18 
months (HR, 1.52; P = .003), 4 or more metastases at SABR (HR, 1.48; P = .048), 
initiation or change in systemic treatment (HR, 0.50; P < .001), and 
oligoprogression (HR, 1.56; P = .008) were significant independent predictors of 
PFS. Tumor diameter (sub-hazard ratio [SHR], 1.28; P < .001), colorectal 
histology (SHR, 4.33; P = .002), and "other" histology (SHR, 3.90; P < .001) 
were associated with worse LC.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort including patients with genuine 
oligometastatic, oligoprogressive, and induced oligometastatic disease, the 
median PFS was 15 months and LC at 3 years was 87%. This supports ongoing 
efforts to randomize patients in phase 3 trials, even outside the original 1 to 
5 metachronous oligometastatic paradigm.

OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to investigate the economic value of 
tumor-agnostic therapies when only single-arm effectiveness data are available 
at launch by applying multiple methodologies to establish comparative 
effectiveness.
METHODS: In the absence of direct comparative data, 3 methods were used to 
estimate the counterfactual: (1) a historical control based on a systematic 
literature review for each tumor site from the larotrectinib trials, (2) an 
intracohort comparison using the previous line of therapy time to progression 
from larotrectinib trials, and (3) a nonresponder control that applied outcomes 
for larotrectinib nonresponders. Cost-effectiveness was modeled using the 
partitioned survival approach. Stochastic parameter uncertainty was assessed in 
a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). A triangulated estimate of the mean 
cost-effectiveness result was generated combining all 3 counterfactual 
estimates.
RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were similar across the 3 
methodologies in the deterministic analysis ranging from £83 868 (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] £65 698-£107 668) to £104 922 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (95% UI £80 132-£139 658). PSA results for each method substantially 
overlapped when plotted on the cost-effectiveness plane. Weighting PSA results 
for each method equally in the triangulation method produced an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of £95 587 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (95% 
UI £70 449-£137 431).
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of direct comparative data, different methods of 
estimating a counterfactual are possible, each with strengths and limitations. 
Triangulating results across the methods provides a composite view of the total 
uncertainty and a more consistent estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the 
tumor-agnostic intervention compared with choosing a single method.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
subsequent cost-effectiveness estimates based on the more physical 
health-focused EQ-5D 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L) value set for England or 
cross-walked EQ-5D 3-level version UK value set scores or more mental health 
recovery-focused Recovering Quality of Life Utility Index (ReQoL-UI), when using 
alternative within-trial statistical methods. We describe possible reasons for 
the different QALY estimates based on the interaction between item scores, 
health state profiles, preference-based scores, and mathematical and statistical 
methods chosen.
METHODS: QALYs are calculated over 8 weeks from a case study 2:1 
(intervention:control) randomized controlled trial in patients with anxiety or 
depression. Complete case and with missing cases imputed using 
multiple-imputation analyses are conducted, using unadjusted and regression 
baseline-adjusted QALYs. Cost-effectiveness is judged using incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios and acceptability curves. We use previously 
established psychometric results to reflect on estimated QALYs.
RESULTS: A total of 361 people (241:120) were randomized. EQ-5D-5L crosswalk 
produced higher incremental QALYs than the value set for England or ReQoL-UI, 
which produced similar unadjusted QALYs, but contrasting baseline-adjusted 
QALYs. Probability of cost-effectiveness <£30 000 per QALY ranged from 6% 
(complete case ReQoL-UI baseline-adjusted QALYs) to 64.3% (multiple-imputation 
EQ-5D-5L crosswalk unadjusted QALYs). The control arm improved more on average 
than the intervention arm on the ReQoL-UI, a result not mirrored on the EQ-5D-5L 
nor condition-specific (Patient-Health Questionnaire-9, depression; Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7, anxiety) measures.
CONCLUSIONS: ReQoL-UI produced contradictory cost-effectiveness results relative 
to the EQ-5D-5L. The EQ-5D-5L's better responsiveness and "anxiety/depression" 
and "usual activities" items drove the incremental QALY results. The ReQoL-UI's 
single physical health item and "personal recovery" construct may have 
influenced its lower 8-week incremental QALY estimates in this patient sample.

OBJECTIVES: Since 2020, COVID-19 has infected tens of millions and caused 
hundreds of thousands of fatalities in the United States. Infection waves lead 
to increased emergency department utilization and critical care admission for 
patients with respiratory distress. Although many individuals develop symptoms 
necessitating a ventilator, some patients with COVID-19 can remain at home to 
mitigate hospital overcrowding. Remote pulse-oximetry (pulse-ox) monitoring of 
moderately ill patients with COVID-19 can be used to monitor symptom escalation 
and trigger hospital visits, as needed.
METHODS: We analyzed the cost-utility of remote pulse-ox monitoring using a 
Markov model with a 3-week time horizon and daily cycles from a US health sector 
perspective. Costs (US dollar 2020) and outcomes were derived from the 
University Hospitals' real-world evidence and published literature. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used to determine the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per QALY. 
We assessed model uncertainty using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Model results demonstrated that remote monitoring dominates current 
standard care, by reducing costs ($11 472 saved) and improving outcomes (0.013 
QALYs gained). There were 87% fewer hospitalizations and 77% fewer deaths among 
patients with access to remote pulse-ox monitoring. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was not sensitive to uncertainty ranges in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient with COVID-19 remote pulse-ox monitoring increases the 
specificity of those requiring follow-up care for escalating symptoms. We 
recommend remote monitoring adoption across health systems to economically 
manage COVID-19 volume surges, maintain patients' comfort, reduce community 
infection spread, and carefully monitor needs of multiple individuals from one 
location by trained experts.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of 3 widely used atrial 
fibrillation (AF) treatments from the perspectives of Chinese healthcare system: 
antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), ThermoCool SmartTouch guided by ablation index 
(STAI), and second-generation cryoballoon (CB2).
METHODS: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was implemented to compare the 
lifetime cost-effectiveness of AADs, STAI, and CB2. AF disease progression was 
explicitly modeled based on the Atrial Fibrillation Progression Trial clinical 
study results. The base-case analysis assumed that patients with paroxysmal AF 
(PAF) entered the model at the age of 55 years and had a CHA2DS2-VASc 
(Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ( > 65 = 1 point, > 75 
= 2 points), Diabetes, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack 
(2 points)-Vascular disease (peripheral arterial disease, previous myocardial 
infarction, aortic atheroma), Age 65 to 74 years, and Sex category) score of 2 
for males and 3 for females. Model parameter uncertainties were incorporated 
throughout the DES simulation with full probabilistic model parameterization.
RESULTS: The lifetime cost-effectiveness evaluations showed that patients 
treated with AADs gained an average of 4.98 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and 9.63 life-years (LYs) at an average cost of US dollar (USD) 15 374. Patients 
treated with CB2 gained 5.92 QALYs and 10.74 LYs at an average cost of USD 
26 811. The STAI group gained an average of 6.55 QALYs and 11.57 LYs at an 
average cost of USD 24 722. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was USD 
5927 and USD 12 167 per QALY for STAI versus AADs and CB2 versus AADs, 
respectively. Assuming the willingness-to-pay threshold for China is USD 30 390 
per QALY, both ablation treatments will be cost-effective compared with AADs for 
patients with PAF.
CONCLUSIONS: The DES model demonstrated that catheter ablations are more 
cost-effective than AADs for patients with PAF under the healthcare system in 
China. Among catheter ablation technologies, STAI provides better outcomes at
