are widely used off-label despite little evidence on benefit-risk ratio. This 
exposes patients to risks related to safety and lack of efficacy, and healthcare 
providers to liability. Introducing new indications for EPs may represent a high 
societal value; however, manufacturers rarely invest in R&D for EPs. The 
objective of this research was to describe incentives and disincentives for 
developing new indications for EPs in Europe and to investigate consequences of 
current policies. Methods: Targeted literature search and expert panel meetings. 
Results: Within the current European-level and national-level regulatory 
framework there are limited incentives for development of new indications with 
EPs. Extension of indication normally does not allow the price to be increased 
or maintained, the market protection period to be extended, or exclusion from a 
reference price system. New indication frequently triggers re-evaluation, 
resulting in price erosion, regardless of the level of added value with the new 
indication. In consequence, manufacturers are more prone to undertake R&D 
efforts at early to mid-stage of product life cycle rather than with EPs, or to 
invest in new chemical entities, even in therapeutic areas with broad off-label 
use. This represents a potentially missed opportunity as developing new 
indications for EPs offers an alternative to off-label use or lengthy and 
expensive R&D for new therapies, opens new opportunities for potentially 
cost-effective treatment alternatives, as well as greater equity in patients' 
access to treatment options. Conclusion: There are potential benefits from the 
development of new indications for EPs that are currently not being realized due 
to a lack of regulatory and pricing incentives in Europe. Incentives for orphan 
or paediatric drugs have proven to be effective in promoting R&D. Similarly, 
incentives to promote R&D in EPs should be developed, for the benefit of 
patients and healthcare systems.

Reef building corals precipitate calcium carbonate as an exo-skeleton and 
provide substratum for prosperous marine life. Biomineralization of the coral's 
skeleton is a developmental process that occurs concurrently with other 
proliferation processes that control the animal extension and growth. The 
development of the animal body is regulated by large gene regulatory networks, 
which control the expression of gene sets that progressively generate 
developmental patterns in the animal body. In this study we have explored the 
gene expression profile and signaling pathways followed by the calcification 
process of a basal metazoan, the Red Sea scleractinian (stony) coral, Stylophora 
pistillata. When treated by seawater with high calcium concentrations (addition 
of 100 gm/L, added as CaCl2.2H2O), the coral increases its calcification rates 
and associated genes were up-regulated as a result, which were then identified. 
Gene expression was compared between corals treated with elevated and normal 
calcium concentrations. Calcification rate measurements and gene expression 
analysis by microarray RNA transcriptional profiling at two time-points (midday 
and night-time) revealed several genes common within mammalian gene regulatory 
networks. This study indicates that core genes of the Wnt and TGF-Î²/BMP 
signaling pathways may also play roles in development, growth, and 
biomineralization in early-diverging organisms such as corals.

PURPOSE: Locally recurrent rectal cancer may cause significant morbidity. Prior 
reports of rectal cancer reirradiation following local recurrence suggest 
treatment efficacy, with variable rates of late toxicity. Modern techniques 
including intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may improve the 
therapeutic index. We report outcomes for pelvic reirradiation as treatment for 
rectal cancer using IMRT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 31 patients undergoing reirradiation for 
rectal cancer between 2004 and 2013 were reviewed. All patients underwent IMRT 
using an accelerated hyperfractionation (39 Gy in 1.5-Gy fractions delivered 
twice daily, n=15) or once-daily fractionation technique (median dose, 30.4 Gy; 
range, 27-40 Gy in 15-22 fractions; n = 16). The median cumulative dose was 77 
Gy (range, 59-113), and the median interval from prior pelvic radiation therapy 
was 39.8 months (range, 10.1-307.6). Treatment intent was palliative in 20 
patients and neoadjuvant or adjuvant in 11 patients. Surgery was generally 
reserved for patients with an isolated local recurrence. Concurrent chemotherapy 
was administered for 25/31 patients, most frequently capecitabine (n=11) or 
continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (n=10).
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 11.3 months. The prescribed treatment was 
completed in 29/31 patients (93.5%). Among 18 patients with symptoms 
attributable to recurrent disease, successful palliation was achieved in 10/18 
(55.6%). The rate of grade 2 and grade 3 acute toxicities was 32.3% and 3.2%, 
respectively. Local control rates at 1 and 2 years were 61.3% and 47.3%, 
respectively. Median overall survival was 21.9 months, and 1-year survival was 
66.7% for patients who had surgical resection versus 58.7% for those who did not 
(P = .0802).
CONCLUSIONS: Rectal cancer reirradiation using IMRT is well-tolerated in the 
setting of prior pelvic radiation therapy. Given significant risk of local 
progression, further dose escalation may be warranted for patients with life 
expectancy exceeding 1 year.

INTRODUCTION: Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a high 
prevalence of unmet surgical need. Provision of operations through surgical 
outreach missions, mostly led by foreign organizations, offers a way to address 
the problem. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgical outreach 
missions provided by a wholly local organization in Ghana to highlight the role 
local groups might play in reducing the unmet surgical need of their 
communities.
METHODS: We calculated the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted by 
surgical outreach mission activities of ApriDec Medical Outreach Group (AMOG), a 
Ghanaian non-governmental organization. The total cost of their activities was 
also calculated. Conclusions about cost-effectiveness were made according to 
World Health Organization (WHO)-suggested parameters.
RESULTS: We analyzed 2008 patients who had been operated upon by AMOG since 
December 2011. Operations performed included hernia repairs (824 patients, 41%) 
and excision biopsy of soft tissue masses (364 patients, 18%). More specialized 
operations included thyroidectomy (103 patients, 5.1%), urological procedures 
(including prostatectomy) (71 patients, 3.5%), and plastic surgery (26 patients, 
1.3%). Total cost of the outreach trips was $283,762, and 2079 DALY were 
averted; cost per DALY averted was 136.49 USD. The mission trips were "very 
cost-effective" per WHO parameters. There was a trend toward a lower cost per 
DALY averted with subsequent outreach trips organized by AMOG.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that providing surgical services through wholly 
local surgical mission trips to underserved LMIC communities might represent a 
cost-effective and viable option for countries seeking to reduce the growing 
unmet surgical needs of their populations.

The developments that have taken place in recent decades in the diagnosis and 
therapy of a number of diseases have led to improvements in prognosis and life 
expectancy. As a consequence, there has been an increase in the number of 
patients affected by chronic diseases and who can face new pathologies during 
their lifetime. The prevalence of chronic heart failure, for example, is 
approximately 1-2% of the adult population in developed countries, rising to 
â¥10% among people >70Â years of age; in 2015, more than 85 million people in 
Europe were living with some sort of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Lubrano and 
Balzan World J Exp Med 5:21-32, 5; Takahashi et al. Circ J 72:867-72, 8; Kaptoge 
et al. Lancet 375:132-40, 9). Chronic disease can become, in turn, a major risk 
factor for other diseases. Furthermore, several new drugs have entered clinical 
practice whose adverse effects on multiple organs are still to be evaluated. All 
this necessarily involves a multidisciplinary vision of medicine, where the 
physician must view the patient as a whole and where collaboration between the 
various specialists plays a key role. An example of what has been said so far is 
the relationship between CVD and chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs). Patients 
with chronic CVD may develop a CID within their lifetime, and, vice versa, a CID 
can be a risk factor for the development of CVD. Moreover, drugs used for the 
treatment of CIDs may have side effects involving the cardiovascular system and 
thus may be contraindicated. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the 
close relationship between these two groups of diseases and to provide 
recommendations on the diagnostic approach and treatments in light of the most 
recent scientific data available.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an integrase inhibitor (INI), 
dolutegravir (DTG), in combination with abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) in 
France, in treatment-naive (TN) HIV adult patients.
METHODS: The ARAMIS microsimulation Markov model, evaluates costs and effects of 
DTG vs. first-line ARVs options including INIs (raltegravir, elvitegravir/c), 
protease inhibitors (PIs) (darunavir/r, atazanavir/r, lopinavir/r), 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz and rilpivirine). 
Efficacy and safety data were derived from phase III studies and network 
meta-analysis. Treatment algorithms were based on French guidelines and experts 
opinion. Costs included routine HIV and opportunistic infection care, and death.
RESULTS: The model showed the fixed-dose combination DTG/ABC/3TC was more 
effective than all other recommended regimens: patients stayed longer on 
first-line, and lived longer and healthier. With the exception of EFV, 
DTG/ABC/3TC was more efficacious and less costly compared to all strategies. The 
cost per QALY gained (ICER) for DTG compared to EFV was â¬6,939. DTG/ABC/3TC was 
more efficacious and less costly compared to INIs and PIs in all deterministic 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: DTG/ABC/3TC was cost-effective in the management of HIV TN patients 
in France. These results are mainly explained by its lower price compared to 
other INIs and PIs, DTG's superior efficacy and high barrier to resistance.

Older adults have been largely overlooked in community studies of HIV in highly 
endemic African countries. In our rural study site in Mpumalanga Province, South 
Africa, HIV prevalence among those aged 50 and older is 16.5%, suggesting that 
older adults are at risk of both acquiring and transmitting HIV. This paper 
utilises community-based focus-group interviews with older rural South African 
men and women to better understand the normative environment in which they come 
to understand and make decisions about their health as they age in an HIV 
endemic setting. We analyse the dimensions of an inductively emerging theme: ku 
ti hlayisa (to take care of yourself). For older adults, 'taking care' in an age 
of AIDS represented: (1) an individualised pathway to achieving old-age 
respectability through the taking up of responsibilities and behaviours that 
characterise being an older person, (2) a set of gendered norms and strategies 
for reducing one's HIV risk, and (3) a shared responsibility for attenuating the 
impact of the HIV epidemic in the local community. Findings reflect the 
individual, interdependent and communal ways in which older rural South Africans 
understand HIV risk and prevention, ways that also map onto current 
epidemiological thinking for improving HIV-related outcomes in high-prevalence 
settings.

Increased life expectancy in patients with Î²-thalassemia (Î²-thal) requires 
healthcare professionals to give greater attention to improving their quality of 
life (QoL). We aimed to evaluate health-related QoL (HRQoL) and its determinants 
in patients with Î²-thal intermedia (Î²-TI) compared with Î²-thal major (Î²-TM). In 
this cross sectional study, 118 patients with Î²-TI, referred to the Thalassemia 
Clinic of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, were investigated 
by convenience sampling from January to June 2014 in southern Iran. A Short 
Form-36 (SF36) questionnaire was used. We had previously conducted a similar 
study in 101 patients with Î²-TM (12 to 38 years). Compared data of the two 
studies were analyzed. Mean age was 26.5âÂ±â6.5 (12 to 48) years in Î²-TI and 
19.5âÂ±â4.4 (12-38) years in the Î²-TM group. The best scales of HRQoL were 
physical functionin (PF) (76.8âÂ±â26.6) and bodily pain (BP) (70.1âÂ±â24.8) in the 
Î²-TI group. Males had significantly better score only in vitality dimension 
compared to females (pâ=â0.020). Higher education (pâ=â0.023) in univariate 
analysis and age â¤20 years (B coefficientâ=â13, pâ=â0.008) in multivariate 
analysis showed significant relationships with higher total HRQoL score in Î²-TI. 
Comparison of Î²-TI and Î²-TM, after adjusting for covariates, total HRQoL was 
similar between the two groups. In evaluating the subscales, only PF showed a 
better condition in patients with Î²-TM [adjusted mean differenceâ=â12.5, 95% 
confidence interval (95% CI): 5.6-19.3, pâ<â0.0001]. Contrary to our 
expectations, QoL in patients with Î²-TI were not better than Î²-TM. Training 
programs and psychosocial support of all patients with Î²-TI and Î²-TM as well as 
their care providers with more focus on older patients, females and the patients 
with lower educational degree should be taken into account.

Continuing efforts from large international consortia have made genome-wide 
epigenomic and transcriptomic annotation data publicly available for a variety 
of cell and tissue types. However, synthesis of these datasets into effective 
summary metrics to characterize the functional non-coding genome remains a 
challenge. Here, we present GenoSkyline-Plus, an extension of our previous work 
through integration of an expanded set of epigenomic and transcriptomic 
annotations to produce high-resolution, single tissue annotations. After 
validating our annotations with a catalog of tissue-specific non-coding elements 
previously identified in the literature, we apply our method using data from 127 
different cell and tissue types to present an atlas of heritability enrichment 
across 45 different GWAS traits. We show that broader organ system categories 
(e.g. immune system) increase statistical power in identifying biologically 
relevant tissue types for complex diseases while annotations of individual cell 
types (e.g. monocytes or B-cells) provide deeper insights into disease etiology. 
Additionally, we use our GenoSkyline-Plus annotations in an in-depth case study 
of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Our analyses suggest a strong 
connection between LOAD heritability and genetic variants contained in regions 
of the genome functional in monocytes. Furthermore, we show that LOAD shares a 
similar localization of SNPs to monocyte-functional regions with Parkinson's 
disease. Overall, we demonstrate that integrated genome annotations at the 
single tissue level provide a valuable tool for understanding the etiology of 
complex human diseases. Our GenoSkyline-Plus annotations are freely available at 
http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoSkyline.

BACKGROUND: Research on health expectancy has been carried out in Bangladesh but 
none of it has examined the differences in Disability-Free Life Expectancy 
(DFLE) between urban and rural setting in context of rapid urbanization of 
Bangladesh in past decades.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to estimate DFLE for people of all ages 
living in urban and rural areas in Bangladesh, and to examine the differences in 
DFLE between these two areas.
METHODS: Data from the Sample Vital Registration System 2010 and the Bangladesh 
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2010 were used in this study. The 
Sullivan method was applied to estimate DFLE in Bangladesh.
RESULTS: Higher rates of mortality and disability were observed in rural areas 
compared to urban areas with few exceptions. Statistically significant 
differences in DFLE were revealed from birth to age 15 years for both sexes 
between urban and rural areas. Urban males had a longer life expectancy (LE), 
longer DFLE and shorter LE with disability both in number and proportion when 
compared to rural males. Rural females at age 20+ years had a longer LE than 
urban females but urban females had a longer DFLE and a shorter LE with 
disability in both number and proportion at all ages than did rural females.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there were clear inequalities in LE, 
DFLE and LE with disability between rural and urban areas of Bangladesh along 
with age-specific differences as well. These findings may serve as useful and 
benchmark for intervention and policy implications for reducing the gap in 
health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a multistage 
tracking system could improve communication between health care providers, 
reducing the risk of delay in diagnosis related to inconsistent communication 
and tracking of radiology follow-up recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unconditional recommendations for imaging follow-up of 
all diagnostic imaging modalities excluding mammography (n = 589) were entered 
into a database and tracked through a multistage tracking system for 13 months. 
Tracking interventions were performed for patients for whom completion of 
recommended follow-up imaging could not be identified 1 month after the 
recommendation due date. Postintervention compliance with the follow-up 
recommendation required examination completion or clinical closure (i.e., 
biopsy, limited life expectancy or death, or subspecialist referral).
RESULTS: Baseline radiology information system checks performed 1 month after 
the recommendation due date revealed timely completion of 43.1% of recommended 
imaging studies at our institution before intervention. Three separate tracking 
interventions were studied, showing effectiveness between 29.0% and 57.8%. The 
multistage tracking system increased the examination completion rate to 70.5% (a 
52% increase) and reduced the rate of unknown follow-up compliance and the 
associated risk of delay in diagnosis to 13.9% (a 74% decrease). Examinations 
completed after tracking intervention generated revenue of 4.1 times greater 
than the labor cost.
CONCLUSION: Performing sequential radiology recommendation tracking 
interventions can substantially reduce the rate of unknown follow-up compliance 
and add value to the health system. Unknown follow-up compliance is a risk 
factor for delay in diagnosis, a form of preventable medical error commonly 
identified in malpractice claims involving radiologists and office-based 
practitioners.

The Missouri AgrAbility program links the Cooperative Extension Service at a 
land-grant university with a nonprofit disability organization to provide 
practical education and assistance that promotes rural independence. This 
project utilized Photovoice to describe how Missouri AgrAbility clients 
perceived how the program impacts their lives. This article relates clients' 
perceptions of the impact of the AgrAbility program on their lives to the 
socio-ecologic model framework. Although the primary focus of AgrAbility is to 
help individuals who have disabilities maintain their independence, all levels 
of the socio-ecological model are integral in meeting the needs of program 
participants.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The choice for an optimal treatment in older lymphoma 
patients is a real challenge for hemato-oncologists. They have to treat a 
potentially curative lymphoma, and concomitantly protect their patients from 
unacceptable toxicities. Some recommendations are provided for the major 
subtypes of lymphomas including the antitumoral treatment and primarily the 
optimal supportive care.
RECENT FINDINGS: All the recent literature data converge to say that the 
approach of an older patient with a malignant hemopathy is a multistep 
procedure. This process comprises the appraisal of life expectancy of the 
patient with or without the disease, the prognostic factors of the tumor, the 
functional, physiological and cognitive functions evaluation, the 
socio-economical environment and the patient's expectancy in terms of quality of 
life. Major progresses have been achieved in the management of diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma in patients up to 80 and above 80 years 
old.
SUMMARY: With all these information in hands, the hematologist will decide if 
the treatment's objective is the standard treatment with optimal supportive care 
(fit patients), tailor-made adapted chemotherapy (unfit patients) or 
preservation of quality of life (frail patients).

Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Patients Physically 
Ineligible for Open Repair: Very Long-term Follow-up in the EVAR-2 Randomized 
Controlled Trial.

Cambridge, United Kingdom â Vascular Surgery Research Group, Imperial College 
London, London, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare long-term total and 
aneurysm-related mortality in physically frail patients with abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (AAA) randomized to either early endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or 
no-intervention.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: EVAR-2 remains the sole randomized trial to identify 
whether EVAR reduces mortality in patients physically ineligible for open 
repair.
METHODS: Between September 1999 and August 2004, 404 patients from 33 centers in 
the United Kingdom aged â¥60 years with AAA >5.5âcm in diameter were randomized 
1:1 using computer-generated sequences of randomly permuted blocks stratified by 
center to receive either EVAR (197) or no-intervention (207). The primary 
analysis compared total and aneurysm-related deaths in groups until June 30, 
2015 (mean, 12.0 yrs; maximum 14.1 yrs).
RESULTS: Mean follow-up until death or censoring was 4.2 years. There were 187 
deaths (22.6 per 100 person-yrs) in the EVAR group and 194 (22.1 per 100 
person-yrs) in the no-intervention group. By 12 years of follow-up the estimated 
survival was 5.3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-9.2] in the EVAR group and 
8.5% (95% CI, 5.2-12.9) in the no-intervention group; there was no significant 
difference in life expectancy between the groups (both 4.2 yrs; P = 0.97). 
However, overall aneurysm-related mortality was significantly lower in the EVAR 
group [3.3 deaths per 100 person-yrs compared with 6.5 deaths per 100 person-yrs 
in the no-intervention group, adjusted hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34-0.91; P = 
0.019)]. Patients surviving beyond 8 years were younger, with higher body mass 
index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and forced expiratory volume in 1 
second.
CONCLUSIONS: EVAR does not increase overall life expectancy in patients 
ineligible for open repair, but can reduce aneurysm-related mortality.

STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a randomized trial of 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) 
versus usual care alone (UC) for chronic low back pain (CLBP).
OBJECTIVE: To determine 1-year cost-effectiveness of CBT and MBSR compared to 33 
UC.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CLBP is expensive in terms of healthcare costs and 
lost productivity. Mind-body interventions have been found effective for back 
pain, but their cost-effectiveness is unexplored.
METHODS: A total of 342 adults in an integrated healthcare system with CLBP were 
randomized to receive MBSR (nâ=â116), CBT (nâ=â113), or UC (nâ=â113). CBT and 
MBSR were offered in 8-weekly 2-hour group sessions. Cost-effectiveness from the 
societal perspective was calculated as the incremental sum of healthcare costs 
and productivity losses over change in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 
payer perspective only included healthcare costs. This economic evaluation was 
limited to the 301 health plan members enrolled â¥180 days in the years pre-and 
postrandomization.
RESULTS: Compared with UC, the mean incremental cost per participant to society 
of CBT was $125 (95% confidence interval, CI: -4103, 4307) and of MBSR was -$724 
(CI: -4386, 2778)-that is, a net saving of $724. Incremental costs per 
participant to the health plan were $495 for CBT over UC and -$982 for MBSR, and 
incremental back-related costs per participant were $984 for CBT over UC and 
-$127 for MBSR. These costs (and cost savings) were associated with 
statistically significant gains in QALYs over UC: 0.041 (0.015, 0.067) for CBT 
and 0.034 (0.008, 0.060) for MBSR.
CONCLUSION: In this setting CBT and MBSR have high probabilities of being 
cost-effective, and MBSR may be cost saving, as compared with UC for adults with 
CLBP. These findings suggest that MBSR, and to a lesser extent CBT, may provide 
cost-effective treatment for CLBP for payers and society.

BACKGROUND: To assess the within-trial cost-effectiveness of an NHS ovarian 
cancer screening (OCS) programme using data from UKCTOCS and extrapolate results 
based on average life expectancy.
METHODS: Within-trial economic evaluation of no screening (C) vs either (1) an 
annual OCS programme using transvaginal ultrasound (USS) or (2) an annual 
ovarian cancer multimodal screening programme with serum CA125 interpreted using 
a risk algorithm (ROCA) and transvaginal ultrasound as a second-line test (MMS), 
plus comparison of lifetime extrapolation of the no screening arm and the MMS 
programme using both a predictive and a Markov model.
RESULTS: Using a CA125-ROCA cost of Â£20, the within-trial results show USS to be 
strictly dominated by MMS, with the MMS vs C comparison returning an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Â£91â452 per life year gained (LYG). If the 
CA125-ROCA unit cost is reduced to Â£15, the ICER becomes Â£77â818 per LYG. 
Predictive extrapolation over the expected lifetime of the UKCTOCS women returns 
an ICER of Â£30â033 per LYG, while Markov modelling produces an ICER of Â£46â922 
per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Analysis suggests that, after accounting for the lead time required 
to establish full mortality benefits, a national OCS programme based on the MMS 
strategy quickly approaches the current NICE thresholds for cost-effectiveness 
when extrapolated out to lifetime as compared with the within-trial ICER 
estimates. Whether MMS could be recommended on economic grounds would depend on 
the confirmation and size of the mortality benefit at the end of an ongoing 
follow-up of the UKCTOCS cohort.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare interventions that have positive effects on the stroke 
survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) might also have positive effects for their spouses in terms 
of improved HRQoL and/or reduced spousal informal support. However, knowledge 
about stroke survivors' HRQoL and QALY and the consequences for their spouses' 
HRQoL and QALY is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the 
HRQoL and QALY-weights in dyads of stroke survivors in comparison with dyads of 
healthy controls, and to study the relationship between the stroke survivors' 
QALY-weights and consequences for spouses in terms of QALY-weight and annual 
cost of informal support, using a long-term perspective.
METHODS: Data on stroke survivors, controls, and spouses were collected from the 
seven-year follow-up of the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke 
(SAHLSIS). HRQoL was assessed by the SF-36, and the preference-based health 
state values were assessed with the SF-6D. The magnitude of the support was 
assessed with a study specific time-diary. An ordinary least squares (OLS) 
regression was used to estimate the association between stroke survivors' and 
spouses' QALY-weights. A two-part econometric model was used to estimate the 
association between stroke survivors' QALY-weights and the time spent and cost 
of spouses' informal support.
RESULTS: Cohabitant dyads of 248 stroke survivors' aged <70 at stroke onset and 
245 controls were included in the study. Stroke survivors had lower HRQoL in the 
SF-36 domains physical functioning, physical role, general health, vitality 
(PÂ <Â 0.001), and social functioning (PÂ =Â 0.005) in comparison with their 
cohabitant spouses. There was no significant difference in HRQoL for the dyads 
of controls. The results from the regression analyses showed that lower 
QALY-weights of the stroke survivors were associated with lower QALY-weights of 
their spouses and increased annual cost of spousal informal support.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the QALY-weights for stroke survivors had 
consequences for their spouses in terms of annual cost of spousal informal 
support and QALY-weights. Hence, economic evaluation of interventions that 
improve the HRQoL of the stroke survivors but ignore the consequences for their 
spouses may underestimate the value of the intervention.

INTRODUCTION: The use of primary endocrine therapy (PET) in managing breast 
cancer in the elderly has become common practice. Whilst there appears to be no 
difference in overall survival in comparison with surgery, PET has been found to 
be inferior in local disease control with a limited duration of efficacy (2-3 
years). The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) state that PET 
may be considered in patients with a short life expectancy (<2 years) or 
considered unfit for surgery. Frequently, decision making for PET allocation is 
a subjective process by the clinician.
METHOD: A systematic literature review was performed to establish what 
prediction models are available for all-cause mortality in the elderly, and what 
breast-specific models have been produced.
RESULTS: 18 prognostic models were deemed eligible from 15 papers. 1 
breast-specific model was found, 2 nursing home related and 15 for 
community-dwelling elders. Accuracy (as defined by discrimination; c-statistic 
or AUROC) ranged from 0.69 (moderate) to 0.86 (very good).
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlighted a variety of validated prognostic indexes. 
Several models with very good accuracy were identified but most were validated 
in US-populations and relied on information from administrative datasets. One 
breast specific model by Stotter etÂ al. was identified, specifically to aid 
treatment planning for frail elderly patients but had limited accuracy. The 
strength of an index will ultimately be on its clinical impact and influence on 
treatment decisions rather than its accuracy and as of yet no trials exploring 
this have been carried out.

[Purpose] Motion capture system is difficult to use in daily life. The aim of 
this study was to propose an estimation model for knee and ankle joint angle 
measurements and locate body center of gravity (COG) of the extension phase 
during standing-up motion. [Subjects and Methods] Seven healthy male volunteers 
were enrolled. An estimation model was proposed for the knee and ankle joint 
angle measurements by combining the angle and acceleration of the trunk, based 
on readings from the inertial sensor attachment on the subject's chest, during 
the extension phase. Joint angles and COG position were compared to those 
obtained by a motion capture system. [Results] The joint angles and COG position 
demonstrated high correlation coefficients which represent strong correlation 
between the proposed model and the motion capture system. The proposed model 
could estimate the joint angle during extension phase, with a maximum error of 
4.58 degrees, as well as COG position in the horizontal and vertical directions 
with maximum errors of 4.48âcm and 3.19âcm, respectively. [Conclusion] The 
proposed system could be used instead of motion capture system to estimate knee 
and ankle joint angles; however, the estimation of the COG position was 
insufficient because of lacked accuracy.

Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) have been widely used in tumor drainage lymph node 
(TDLN) imaging, drug delivery, photothermal therapy, and so on. However, during 
the theranostic applications, the accumulation efficiency of CNPs in target 
organs is unknown yet, which largely hinders the extension of CNPs into clinical 
uses. Herein, we prepared skeleton-labeled 13C-CNPs that had identical 
properties to commercial CNPs suspension injection (CNSI) for the imaging and 
quantification in TDLN. 13C-CNPs were prepared by arc discharge method, followed 
by homogenization with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The size distribution and 
morphology of 13C-CNPs were nearly the same as those of CNSI under transmission 
electron microscope. The hydrodynamic radii of both 13C-CNPs and CNSI were 
similar, too. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared 
spectroscopy analyses, the chemical compositions and chemical states of elements 
were also nearly identical for both labeled and commercial forms. The skeleton 
labeling of 13C was reflected by the shift of G-band toward lower frequency in 
Raman spectra. 13C-CNPs showed competitive performance in TDLN imaging, where 
the three lymph nodes (popliteal lymph node, common iliac artery lymph node, and 
paraaortic lymph node) were stained black upon the injection into the hind 
extremity of mice. The direct quantification of 13C-CNPs indicated that 877 Î¼g/g 
of 13C-CNPs accumulated in the first station of TDLN (popliteal lymph node). The 
second station of TDLN (common iliac artery lymph node) had even higher 
accumulation level (1,062 Î¼g/g), suggesting that 13C-CNPs migrated efficiently 
along lymphatic vessel. The value decreased to 405 Î¼g/g in the third station of 
TDLN (paraaortic lymph node). Therefore, the 13C-CNPs provided quantitative 
approach to image and quantify CNSI in biological systems. The implication in 
biomedical applications and biosafety evaluations of CNSI is discussed.

Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology 
Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Wang M, Xie X, Wells D, Higgins C.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in Canadian 
men. Radical prostatectomy is one of the treatment options available, and 
involves removing the prostate gland and surrounding tissues. In recent years, 
surgeons have begun to use robot-assisted radical prostatectomy more frequently. 
We aimed to determine the clinical benefits and harms of the robotic surgical 
system for radical prostatectomy (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy) compared 
with the open and laparoscopic surgical methods. We also assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy in 
patients with clinically localized prostate cancer in Ontario.
METHODS: We performed a literature search and included prospective comparative 
studies that examined robot-assisted versus open or laparoscopic radical 
prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The outcomes of interest were perioperative,
