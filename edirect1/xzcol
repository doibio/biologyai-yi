hospitalisation would be taken by people aged 75 years and above. It is 
projected that this phenomenon would be converted to a more balanced structure 
when the demographic transition changes into a more stable distribution. 
Apparently, the impact of ageing on the public hospital system has not been well 
understood and prepared. The determined result provides insight into monitoring 
the capacity of the hospital system to cope with a rapidly changing demographic 
society. It provides empirical evidence of the impact of ageing on the public 
hospitalisation system. It gives a long term projection up to the year 2066 
while the situation would be different from the transient period of 2016⁻2030. 
The analysis adopts a fixed rate approach, which assumes the LOS to be only 
driven by demographic factors, while any improvements in health technologies and 
health awareness are not accounted for. Only inpatient data from the Hospital 
Authority were used, nonetheless, they are the best available for the study. Due 
to the limitation of data, proximity to death is not controlled in conducting 
this analysis.

Research on neurodegenerative brain disorders, namely the age-dependent 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been intensified in the last decade due to the 
absence of a cure and the recognized increasing of life expectancy for 
populations. To address the multifactorial nature and complexity of AD, a 
multi-target-directed ligand approach was herein employed, by designing a set of 
six selected hybrids (14⁻19) that combine in the same entity two pharmacophores: 
tacrine (TAC) and 2-phenylbenzothiazole (PhBTA). The compounds contain a methoxy 
substituent at the PhBTA moiety and have a variable length linker between that 
and the TAC moiety. The docking studies showed that all the compounds assure a 
dual-binding mode of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, establishing 
π-stacking and H-bond interactions with aminoacid residues at both active 
binding sites of the enzyme (CAS and PAS). The bioassays revealed that the 
designed compounds display excellent AChE inhibitory activity in the 
sub-micromolar range (0.06⁻0.27 μM) and moderate inhibition values for amyloid-β 
(Aβ) self-aggregation (27⁻44.6%), compounds 14 and 15 being the lead compounds. 
Regarding neuroprotective effects in neuroblastoma cells, compounds 15, 16 and 
19 revealed the capacity to prevent Aβ-induced toxicity, but compound 16 showed 
the highest neuroprotective effect. Overall these hybrid compounds, in 
particular 15 and 16, with promising multitarget anti-AD ability, encourage 
further pursuing studies on this type of TAC-PhBTA derivatives for potential AD 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the 
national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint 
methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. Here, we 
present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the 
number of disability-adjusted life years of cataracts from occupational exposure 
to solar ultraviolet radiation, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint 
methodology.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to 
solar ultraviolet radiation (Systematic Review 1) and systematically review and 
meta-analyse estimates of the effect of occupational exposure to solar 
ultraviolet radiation on the development of cataract (Systematic Review 2), 
applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing 
framework and conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized 
way.
DATA SOURCES: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search 
electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published 
and unpublished studies, including Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of 
Sciences. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet 
search engines and organizational websites; hand search reference list of 
previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional 
experts.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA: We will include working-age (≥15 years) workers 
in WHO and/or ILO Member States, but exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid 
domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative studies 
on the prevalence of relevant levels of occupational exposure to solar 
ultraviolet radiation and of the total working time spent outdoors from 1960 to 
2018, stratified by sex, age, country and industrial sector or occupation. For 
Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort 
studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with 
an estimate of the effect of any occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet 
radiation (i.e. ≥30 Jm-2/day of occupational solar UV exposure at the surface of 
the eye) on the prevalence or incidence of cataract, compared with the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. <30 Jm-2/day of occupational solar 
UV exposure at the surface of the eye).
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: At least two review authors will 
independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a 
first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, 
followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review 
authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most 
suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will 
combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the 
guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for 
Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2. PROSPERO 
registration: CRD42018098897.

BACKGROUND: New point-of-care (POC) assays for early infant HIV diagnosis are 
costlier than conventional total nucleic acid assays, but could increase access 
to testing, shorten time to results, and expedite initiation of antiretroviral 
therapy. We aimed to assess the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of 
incorporating these POC assays into early infant diagnosis programmes in 
Zimbabwe.
METHODS: We used the Cost Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications 
(CEPAC)-Pediatric model to examine the clinical benefits, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of replacing conventional assays for early infant HIV 
diagnosis with POC assays at age 6 weeks in Zimbabwe. We simulated two 
strategies for early infant HIV diagnosis: conventional and POC. Modelled assays 
differed in sensitivity; specificity; time to, and probability of, return of 
results; and cost. Model outcomes included survival, life expectancy, and mean 
lifetime per-person treatment cost, which were reported separately for all 
HIV-exposed infants and all infants with HIV. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios with discounted (3% per year) costs and life 
expectancy from a health-care system perspective for all HIV-exposed infants. We 
judged incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $1010 (Zimbabwe's annual gross 
domestic product per person) or less per year of life saved to be 
cost-effective.
FINDINGS: When conventional assays were used for early infant diagnosis, 
projected undiscounted life expectancy was 22·7 years for infants with HIV and 
62·5 years for all HIV-exposed infants, at a cost of $610 per HIV-exposed 
infant. Use of POC assays for early infant HIV diagnosis improved projected 
undiscounted life expectancy to 25·5 years among infants with HIV and 62·6 years 
among HIV-exposed infants at a cost of $690 per HIV-exposed infant. At age 12 
weeks, survival among all infants with HIV was 76·1% with the conventional 
testing strategy and 83·5% with the POC testing strategy. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of POC assays versus conventional assays for early 
infant diagnosis was $680 per year of life saved. When conventional assay 
characteristics remained constant, this ratio remained under the 
cost-effectiveness threshold as long as the specificity and sensitivity of the 
POC assay were greater than 92% and 65%, respectively. Our results were robust 
to plausible variations in POC assay cost, the probability of ART initiation, 
and probability of return of the results of POC testing.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with conventional assays, POC assays for early infant 
HIV diagnosis in Zimbabwe will improve survival, extend life expectancy, and be 
cost-effective for HIV-exposed infants.

Previous studies have consistently shown the recurrent relationship between 
macroeconomic cycles and changes in mortality trends, so that recessions are 
generally associated with periods of faster life expectancy rise, and periods of 
economic growth with slower reductions or even increases in mortality trends. 
Here we analyze the link between annual per capita estimates of gross domestic 
product and daily atmospheric temperatures and standardized death rates for a 
large ensemble of European regions to describe the effect of the Great Recession 
on annual and seasonal changes in all-cause human mortality trends. Results show 
that the countries and regions with the largest (smallest) economic slowdown 
were also those with the largest (smallest) strengthening of the declining 
mortality trend. This procyclical evolution of mortality rates is found to be 
stronger during the cold part of the year, showing that it also depends on the 
seasonal timing of the underlying causes of death.

Alcohol use leads to a substantial number of hospitalizations, and to increased 
health and social harms as well as economic costs in Ontario and across Canada. 
The effects of alcohol price changes on consumption and resulting harms have 
been firmly established; changes in the minimum price of alcohol have the 
greatest effect on consumption among people who for reasons of affordability 
consume low-priced alcoholic beverages, typically adolescents, people with lower 
socio-economic status, and people with harmful alcohol use. Decreases in 
inflation-adjusted minimum pricing in British Columbia from 2002 to 2006 have 
been associated with increases in deaths wholly attributable to alcohol. 
Furthermore, decreases in alcohol prices have been previously associated with 
increases in drink-driving, decreases in life expectancy, increases in road 
traffic injuries, violence, and alcohol poisonings, and long-term increases in 
deaths from infectious diseases, circulatory diseases, and digestive diseases. 
Based on the findings of previous studies, lowering the cost of alcohol will 
negatively impact the health of Ontarians and further strain a healthcare system 
with limited resources. Accordingly, Ontario should be strengthening alcohol 
policies to improve public health, including raising the minimum price of 
alcohol, rather than weakening alcohol policies.

La consommation d’alcool mène à un nombre important d’hospitalisations, et à une 
augmentation des méfaits sur la santé et la société, ainsi que des coûts 
économiques en Ontario et dans l’ensemble du Canada. Les effets des variations 
du prix de l’alcool sur sa consommation et les méfaits qui en résultent ont été 
fermement établis; les modifications du prix de vente minimum de l’alcool ont le 
plus grand effet sur la consommation des personnes qui, pour des raisons 
d’accessibilité économique, consomment des boissons alcoolisées à bas prix, en 
général des adolescents, des personnes de statut socio-économique inférieur et 
des personnes ayant une consommation abusive d’alcool. En Colombie-Britannique, 
la diminution du prix de vente minimum de l’alcool (en dollars constant) entre 
2002 et 2006 a été associée à des augmentations de décès entièrement attribuable 
à l’alcool. De plus, la diminution du prix de vente minimum de l’alcool est 
associée à l’ivresse au volant, à la réduction de l’espérance de vie, aux 
accidents de la circulation, à la violence et l’intoxication alcoolique, et à 
l’augmentation à long terme des décès causées par des maladies infectieuses, 
circulatoires et digestives. D’après les conclusions d’autres études, réduire le 
prix de ventre de l’alcool aura des conséquences néfastes sur la santé de la 
population ontarienne et mettra à rude épreuve les ressources déjà limitées du 
système de santé provinciale. En conséquence, l’Ontario devrait renforcer la 
politique en matière d’alcool afin d’améliorer la santé publique, notamment en 
augmentant le prix de vente minimum de l’alcool, au lieu de l’affaiblir.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical value of erythrocyte life span in the 
diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma patients with anemia.
METHODS: The clinical data of 45 patients with lymphoma diagnosed by Department 
of Hematology in Beijing Union Hospital from January 2017 to June 2017 were 
collected. The life of erythrocytes was detected by alveolar gas CO test.
RESULTS: The incidence of anemia in patients with malignant lymphoma was 46.7%, 
40.0% of patients displayed the shorting of blood cell life and the hemolytic 
status existed in 15.56% of patients. The incidence of anemia was 47.1% in 
patients with DLBCL. Patients with B symptoms, bone marrow involvement, 
splenomegaly or LDH increase often accompanied with anemia, but only the 
splenomegaly and LDH level were significantly negatively correlated with red 
blood cell life; there was a significant difference in the effects of CHOP ± R 
regimen and other chemotherapy regimens (R+MINE/FC/SMILE/GDP) on patients with 
anemia and erythrocyte life span.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of anemia in patients with lymphoma is high, red cell 
damage or shortened life may be involved in the mechanism of anemia, the use of 
a strong chemotherapy regimen can significantly shorten the red blood cell life 
of patients and aggravates anemia.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of early treatment with 
direct-acting antiviral therapy in adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection compared with treatment deferral.
STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a Markov model to assess the cost effectiveness of 
treating a hypothetical cohort of 30 000 adolescent patients with chronic HCV at 
age 12 years compared with deferring treatment until adulthood from a societal 
perspective. Model inputs for transition probabilities, HCV treatment and 
medical care costs, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) utilities were derived 
from the literature and wholesale acquisition estimates. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses varied parameters for non-HCV medical care and treatment 
cost, reinfection rates, treatment uptake, disease progression, liver transplant 
survival, and treatment with recently approved pangenotypic direct-acting 
antiviral agents. Discounted costs and total QALYs per person were quantified 
after 30 years. Cost effectiveness was evaluated as the incremental change in 
total medical costs per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness of early treatment initiation 
compared with deferred treatment was approximately $27 000 per QALY gained after 
30 years and considered cost effective. In a scenario analysis, hypothetical 
treatment initiation with currently available pangenotypic agents would be even 
more cost effective, ranging from $10 000 to $21 000 per QALY gained. 
Cost-effectiveness estimates were sensitive to variations in decompensated 
cirrhosis progression in adolescence, adult reinfection, and treatment uptake in 
adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment in adolescent patients with chronic HCV infection 
with currently available direct-acting antivirals seems to be cost effective 
compared with deferred treatment. Future efforts to control the HCV epidemic 
should include increasing the number of children treated.

BACKGROUND: Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone improves 
progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Radium-223 improves overall survival and 
delays the onset of symptomatic skeletal events in patients with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases. We assessed concurrent 
treatment with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone and 
radium-223 in such patients.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 
165 oncology and urology centres in 19 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 
years or older, and had histologically confirmed, progressive, 
chemotherapy-naive, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer and bone metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 6 months, and adequate 
haematological, renal, and liver function. Participants were randomly assigned 
(1:1) according to a permuted block design (block size 4) via interactive 
response technology to receive up to six intravenous injections of radium-223 
(55 kBq/kg) or matching placebo once every 4 weeks. All patients were also 
scheduled to receive oral abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily plus oral 
prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily during and after radium-223 or 
placebo treatment. The primary endpoint was symptomatic skeletal event-free 
survival, which was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety 
analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of any study 
drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02043678. 
Enrolment has been completed, and follow-up is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between March 30, 2014, and Aug 12, 2016, 806 patients were randomly 
assigned to receive radium-223 (n=401) or placebo (n=405) in addition to 
abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone. The study was unblinded 
prematurely, on Nov 17, 2017, after more fractures and deaths were noted in the 
radium-223 group than in the placebo group (in an unplanned ad-hoc analysis), 
but all patients had completed radium-223 or placebo before this date. At the 
primary analysis (data cutoff Feb 15, 2018), 196 (49%) of 401 patients in 
radium-223 group had had at least one symptomatic skeletal event or died, 
compared with 190 (47%) of 405 patients in the placebo group (median follow-up 
21·2 months [IQR 17·0-25·8]). Median symptomatic skeletal event-free survival 
was 22·3 months (95% CI 20·4-24·8) in the radium-223 group and 26·0 months 
(21·8-28·3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·122 [95% CI 0·917-1·374]; 
p=0·2636). Fractures (any grade) occurred in 112 (29%) of 392 patients in the 
radium-223 group and 45 (11%) of 394 patients in the placebo group. The most 
common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were hypertension (43 [11%] 
patients in the radium-223 group vs 52 [13%] patients in the placebo group), 
fractures (36 [9%] vs 12 [3%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase 
concentrations (34 [9%] vs 28 [7%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events 
occurred in 160 (41%) patients in the radium-223 group and 155 (39%) in the 
placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in two (1%) patients in the 
radium-223 group (acute myocardial infarction and interstitial lung disease) and 
one (<1%) in the placebo group (arrhythmia).
INTERPRETATION: The addition of radium-223 to abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone or prednisolone did not improve symptomatic skeletal event-free 
survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone 
metastases, and was associated with an increased frequency of bone fractures 
compared with placebo. Thus, we do not recommend use of this combination.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with a poor 
prognosis. Lung transplantation is the only intervention shown to increase life 
expectancy for patients with IPF, but it is associated with disease-specific 
challenges. In this Review, we discuss the importance of a proactive approach to 
the management of IPF comorbidities, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, 
pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and malignancy. With a donor 
pool too small to meet demand and unacceptably high mortality on transplant 
waiting lists, we discuss different systems used internationally to facilitate 
organ allocation. We explore the rapidly evolving landscape of transplantation 
for patients with IPF with regards to antifibrotic therapy, technological 
advances in extracorporeal life support, advances in understanding of the 
genetics of the disease, and the importance of a holistic multidisciplinary 
approach to care. Finally, we consider potential advances over the next decade 
that are envisaged to improve transplantation outcomes in patients with advanced 
IPF.

An increasing number of individuals will face age-related cognitive difficulties 
because life expectancy has increased. It is, therefore, important to identify 
modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment. Very short-term to mid-term 
blood pressure variability (BPV) may be such a factor because it may cause 
cerebral ischemia. To this end, we investigated whether greater systolic and 
diastolic BPV are cross-sectionally associated with memory function (n=1804), 
information processing speed (n=1793), and executive function (n=1780) in 40- to 
75-year-old individuals from The Maastricht Study. A composite BPV-index was 
derived by standardizing within-visit, 24-hour, and 7-day BPV. We performed 
linear regression with adjustments for age, sex, educational level, 24-hour 
systolic or diastolic pressure, and cardiovascular risk factors. We found that a 
1-SD greater systolic BPV was not associated with information processing speed 
(β [SD difference], -0.10; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.06), or executive function (-0.09; 
95% CI, -0.20 to 0.02) but was marginally associated with lower memory function 
(-0.11; 95% CI, -0.21 to 0.00). A 1-SD greater diastolic BPV was associated with 
lower information processing speed (-0.10; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.00) and executive 
function (-0.12; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.01) and marginally associated with lower 
memory function (-0.09; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.01). These effects on cognitive 
performance are equivalent to ≈3 additional years of aging. In conclusion, 
greater very short-term to mid-term diastolic and, to a lesser extent, systolic 
BPV may be a modifiable risk factor for cognitive deterioration in 40- to 
75-year-old, community-dwelling individuals.

AIM: This study aims to evaluate the methods of treatment of the thoracic part 
of oesophagal cancer and to predict the results of treatment depending on the 
factors of the prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of treatment of 366 patients with cancer of 
the thoracic part of the oesophagus for 10 years (2007-2016) by the department 
of thoracic oncology of the Karaganda oncological dispensary were studied.
RESULTS: The overall five-year survival rate, regardless of the method of 
treatment, was only 8.72% (28 of 321), and in the 6-10 year period 8.41% (27 of 
321) lived, p < 0.05. Analysis of the overall survival of patients with cancer 
of the thoracic part of oesophagus showed that the method of treatment does not 
have a significant effect on life expectancy. A multivariate analysis of 19 
grades that affect the prognosis of the disease was carried out.
CONCLUSION: Radical type of treatment of the middle and lower thoracic 
oesophagus is surgical, in which the median of cumulative survival is 19 months. 
Traditional radiotherapy should be used in a limited way, as it is palliative, 
with a median survival of no more than 9 months. The leading factor in the 
prognosis for thoracic part of oesophagal cancer is the presence of regional 
metastases, on which the choice of method of treatment depends.

risks.

BACKGROUND: Care for patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) has improved 
substantially in recent decades. Increasing clinical knowledge and genetic 
analysis allow early diagnosis of the disease in childhood. Because of the 
earlier initiation to preventive and medical treatment, patients' life 
expectancy has risen. To ensure optimal care, pediatric patients require a safe 
follow-up regime, multidisciplinary care, and a safe transition to adult care.
METHODS: We collected a sample of 149 pediatric Marfan patients, of whom 34 
patients had already been transferred to adult care or who were currently 
transitioning. First, we evaluated clinical aspects of patients that manifest in 
childhood and are present in the transition process. Second, we analyzed the 
transition process itself.
RESULTS: We found age-dependent manifestation of organ pathologies. Dilatation 
of the sinus of Valsalva showed a particularly high prevalence during the 
transition process and 62% of patients required medical treatment. Mean onset of 
aortic root dilatation was 9.9±5.8 years. Concerning systemic manifestation in 
MFS skin striae, wrist and thumb sign, and reduced elbow extension occurred 
significantly more often in patients who were transitioning than in younger 
children with MFS. All other clinical Marfan features showed an increased 
prevalence in patients who were transitioning compared with younger patients. In 
our cohort, transition was successful in 20 patients (58.9%), 12 patients 
(35.3%) are still in the transition process and 2 patients (5.9%) were lost to 
follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: Marfan patients in the transition process are already under a 
chronic disease condition with a high onset of especially cardiovascular 
pathologies. Although early medical treatment in childhood is effective, the 
pathologies of the connective tissue require lifelong attention and influence 
life in many ways. The big challenge during transition is the double change of 
responsibility from the parents and pediatric doctor to the patient and adult 
doctor. Consequently, patients in transition process require special attention 
and close contact with the doctor and the family. A reevaluation by the 
supervising pediatric Marfan specialist of the successful transition to adult 
care is indispensable before the pediatric care of Marfan patients is completed.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) who completed 1 of 2 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of add-on cannabidiol (CBD) 
(GWPCARE3, NCT02224560 or GWPCARE4, NCT02224690) were invited to enroll in an 
open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of 
CBD (GWPCARE5, NCT02224573). Herein we present an interim analysis of the 
safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes from this trial.
METHODS: Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD 
oral solution (Epidiolex; 100 mg/mL), titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg/d over a 
2-week titration period, in addition to their existing medications. Doses could 
be reduced if not tolerated or increased up to 30 mg/kg/d if thought to be of 
benefit.
RESULTS: This interim analysis was based on a November 2016 data cut. Of 368 
patients who completed treatment in GWPCARE3 and GWPCARE4, 366 (99.5%) enrolled 
in the OLE study (GWPCARE5). Median treatment duration was 38 weeks at a mean 
modal dose of 23 mg/kg/d. Most patients (92.1%) experienced adverse events 
(AEs), primarily of mild (32.5%) or moderate (43.4%) severity. The most common 
AEs were diarrhea (26.8%), somnolence (23.5%), and convulsion (21.3%). 
Thirty-five patients (9.6%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. Liver 
transaminase elevations were reported in 37 patients (10.1%), of whom 29 were 
receiving concomitant valproic acid; 34 cases resolved spontaneously or with 
dose modification of CBD or concomitant medication. Median reduction from 
baseline in drop seizure frequency (quantified monthly over 12-week periods) 
ranged from 48% to 60% through week 48. Median reduction in monthly total 
seizure frequency ranged from 48% to 57% across all 12-week periods through week 
48. Eighty-eight percent of patients/caregivers reported an improvement in the 
patient's overall condition per the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of 
Change scale.
SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, long-term add-on CBD treatment had an acceptable 
safety profile in patients with LGS and led to sustained reductions in seizures.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of fixed-ratio combination 
insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus comparator regimens for type 2 
diabetes in Spain, based on real-world evidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data were taken from the European Xultophy 
Treatment Retrospective Audit (EXTRA) real-world evidence study in which 
patients failing to meet glycaemic targets were switched to IDegLira. Baseline 
regimens (prior to IDegLira treatment) were categorized as: multiple daily 
insulin injections (MDI; 28%); glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists 
in combination with insulin (24%); basal insulin (19%); GLP-1 receptor agonists 
(10%); and non-injectable medications (19%). The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was 
used to project long-term outcomes for patients switching to IDegLira or 
continuing their baseline regimens (excluding non-injectable regimens). Costs 
were accounted from a Spanish National Health System perspective. Future costs 
and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually and sensitivity analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: IDegLira was projected to reduce the incidence of diabetes-related 
complications and improve quality-adjusted life expectancy versus all four 
comparators. IDegLira reduced direct medical costs versus GLP-1 receptor 
agonists in combination with insulin, and versus GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy, 
and was therefore considered dominant (cost saving while improving outcomes). 
IDegLira was found to be cost-effective versus MDI and basal insulin with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of EUR 3013 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained and EUR 6890 per QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections based on real-world evidence indicated that 
IDegLira is likely to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs or be 
cost-effective compared with other injectable regimens in people with type 2 
diabetes in Spain.

Pharmacological treatments can extend mouse lifespan, but lifespan effects often 
differ between sexes. 17-α estradiol (17aE2), a less feminizing structural 
isomer of 17-β estradiol, produces lifespan extension only in male mice, 
suggesting a sexually dimorphic mechanism of lifespan regulation. We tested 
whether these anti-aging effects extend to anatomical and functional 
aging-important in late-life health-and whether gonadally derived hormones 
control aging responses to 17aE2 in either sex. While 17aE2 started at 4 months 
of age diminishes body weight in both sexes during adulthood, in late-life 
17aE2-treated mice better maintain body weight. In 17aE2-treated male mice, the 
higher body weight is associated with heavier skeletal muscles and larger muscle 
fibers compared with untreated mice during aging, while treated females have 
heavier subcutaneous fat. Maintenance of skeletal muscle in male mice is 
associated with improved grip strength and rotarod capacity at 25 months, in 
addition to higher levels of most amino acids in quadriceps muscle. We further 
show that sex-specific responses to 17aE2-metabolomic, structural, and 
functional-are regulated by gonadal hormones in male mice. Castrated males have 
heavier quadriceps than intact males at 25 months, but do not respond to 17aE2, 
suggesting 17aE2 promotes an anti-aging skeletal muscle phenotype similar to 
castration. Finally, 17aE2 treatment benefits can be recapitulated in mice when 
treatment is started at 16 months, suggesting that 17aE2 may be able to improve 
aspects of late-life function even when started after middle age.
