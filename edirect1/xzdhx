IMPORTANCE: Although the number of treatments for elderly patients with 
non-transplant-eligible (NTE) multiple myeloma (MM) has increased substantially, 
evidence is lacking on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
novel treatment sequences.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal sequence of treatment for patients with NTE 
MM from the perspective of the patient, physician, and society.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using data from a Dutch observational 
registry, this economic evaluation combined evidence from network meta-analyses 
in a patient-level simulation model and modeled time-to-event and types of 
events from a hospital perspective with a lifetime horizon. Data analysis was 
performed from June 2019 to September 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Thirty treatment sequences, including up to 3 lines of therapy, 
were compared with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone 
(VMP)-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LenDex)-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (PomDex).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes of the model were overall 
survival (OS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Sequences starting with daratumumab-VMP (second line: 
carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone or elotuzumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) 
or bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide-maintenance 
bortezomib-thalidomide (VMPT-VT) (second line: 
daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) had the largest expected OS (7.5 years), 
which is 3.5 additional life-years compared with VMP-LenDex-PomDex. Total costs 
per patient for these sequences ranged between $786 024 and $1 085 794. The 
sequence 
VMPT-VT-carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone-panobinostat-bortezomib-dexamethasone 
had the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio ($98 585 per life-year gained 
and $132 707 per QALY gained vs VMP-LenDex-PomDex).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that sequences including novel 
treatments were highly effective, but the cost-effectiveness ratios were above 
currently accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. Treating MM with novel agents 
necessitates either a large increase in budget or a substantial reduction of 
drug costs by price negotiations, and these findings can support these 
reimbursement decisions and price negotiations.

563. Pharmacoeconomic Report: Voretigene Neparvovec (Luxturna): (Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.): Indication: Vision loss, inherited retinal 
dystrophy [Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2021 Jan.
CADTH Common Drug Reviews.

To address the identified limitations presented in Table 2, CADTH assumed a 
10-year treatment duration for voretigene neparvovec, used data from crossover 
patients in Study 301 to inform short-term transition probabilities, and updated 
the sponsor’s utility estimates with the values provided by clinical experts 
consulted by CADTH. The CADTH reanalysis of the sponsor’s economic model 
estimated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for voretigene 
neparvovec compared with best supportive care (BSC) was $200,477 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. To achieve an ICER of $50,000 per QALY 
compared with BSC, the price of voretigene neparvovec would need to be reduced 
by more than 74%. The submitted price of voretigene neparvovec is a key driver 
of overall costs and of the ICER within the model. While the cost of voretigene 
neparvovec is known and is incurred at the beginning of the model time horizon, 
the majority (96%) of the clinical benefit (QALYs gained) was estimated through 
extrapolation beyond the observed trial period (Study 301). The extrapolations 
were made based on several assumptions with high levels of untestable 
uncertainty. Estimates for treatment effectiveness and natural history were 
further associated with both significant parameter and structural uncertainties. 
Since the expected duration of the treatment effect of voretigene neparvovec and 
the utility estimates were also key drivers in the model, CADTH conducted 
additional scenario analyses that highlighted a wide range of plausible ICER 
estimates across different durations of treatment effect. Since most of the 
benefit estimated in the model originates from the improvements in quality of 
life as opposed to increased life expectancy, the results are sensitive to the 
choice of utility weights. Previous studies in different clinical settings have 
shown that valuation of health states by proxies typically underestimates the 
utility weight in chronic disability health states compared with those elicited 
by the patients themselves. In such instances, this would overestimate 
differences in quality of life between voretigene neparvovec and BSC, which 
would result in a higher ICER for voretigene neparvovec. Together, these 
limitations indicate that the cost-effectiveness results should be cautiously 
interpreted.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) is the leading cause of long-term 
care in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: This study estimates the annual healthcare and long-term care costs 
in fiscal year 2018 for adults over 65 years of age with ADD in Japan and the 
informal care costs and productivity loss for their families.
METHODS: Healthcare and long-term care costs for ADD were estimated according to 
the disease severity classified by the clinical dementia rating (CDR) score, 
using reports from a literature review. For the costs of time spent on 
caregiving activities, productivity loss for ADD family caregivers aged 20-69 
and informal care costs for all ADD family caregivers were estimated.
RESULTS: The total healthcare cost of ADD was JPY 1,073 billion, of which 86% 
(JPY 923 billion) was attributed to healthcare costs other than ADD drug costs 
(JPY 151 billion). The healthcare costs other than ADD drug costs by severity 
were less than JPY 200 billion for CDR 0.5, CDR 1, and CDR 2, respectively, but 
increased to JPY 447 billion (48%) for CDR 3. The public long-term care costs 
were estimated to be JPY 4,783 billion, which increased according to the 
severity. Total productivity loss for ADD family caregivers aged 20-69 was JPY 
1,547 billion and the informal care cost for all ADD family caregivers was JPY 
6,772 billion.
CONCLUSION: ADD costs have a significant impact on public-funded healthcare, 
long-term care systems, and families in Japan. To minimize the economic burden 
of ADD, prolonging healthy life expectancy is the key factor to address.

Goal 17 of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) attracted attention to the 
importance of partnerships between governments, the private sector, and 
nonprofit organizations (NPOs) for sustainable development. This paper aims to 
analyze the processes of establishing and operating the partnerships between 
NPOs and other actors in terms of governance. The best practices for partnership 
governance were examined according to the partnering life cycle framework. A 
simple random sample of 184 NPOs in six regions of Saudi Arabia was selected for 
data collection. These organizations were analyzed according to their governance 
practices in 937 partnerships established during 2016-2018. The findings showed 
that the organizations had strongly implemented the phases of building and 
scoping and managing and maintaining, while their governance practices regarding 
phases of reviewing and revising and sustaining outcomes ranged between moderate 
and low levels. The results also revealed significant differences between the 
overall implementation of the partnering life cycle practices and the NPO's year 
of establishment. It was concluded that analyzing the current situation of 
implementing the best practices of partnership governance is useful to explore 
the efficiency and effectiveness of partnerships between NPOs and other actors, 
as well as the existing policy gaps, so as to create and implement 
sustainable-oriented partnerships.

To date, retinal implants are the only available treatment for blind individuals 
with retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa. Argus II is the only 
visual implant with FDA approval, with more than 300 users worldwide. Argus II 
stimulation is based on a grayscale image coming from a head-mounted 
visible-light camera. Normally, the 11°×19° field of view of the Argus II user 
is full of objects that may elicit similar phosphenes. The prosthesis cannot 
meaningfully convey so much visual information, and the percept is reduced to an 
ambiguous impression of light. This study is aimed at investigating the efficacy 
of simplifying the video input in real-time using a heat-sensitive camera. Data 
were acquired from four Argus II users in 5 stationary tasks with either hot 
objects or human targets as stimuli. All tasks were of m-alternative forced 
choice design where precisely one of the m≥2 response alternatives was defined 
to be "correct" by the experimenter. To compare performance with heat-sensitive 
and normal cameras across all tasks, regardless of m, we used an extension of 
signal detection theory to latent variables, estimating person ability and item 
difficulty in d' units. Results demonstrate that subject performance was 
significantly better across all tasks with the thermal camera compared to the 
regular Argus II camera. The future addition of thermal imaging to devices with 
very poor spatial resolution may have significant real-life benefits for 
orientation, personal safety, and social interactions, thereby improving quality 
of life.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous mastocytosis is a rare pathology characterized by an 
abnormal proliferation and degranulation of mast cells, affecting the skin. Here 
we present the case of a patient suffering from chronic resistant mastocytosis. 
An original integrative method of evaluation was tested in this patient, to 
improve therapeutic management. It integrated the interactions between stressful 
life events and medical history as well as psychobehavioral components and 
neurobiological factors.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 65-year-old Caucasian woman. The cutaneous 
symptoms of mastocytosis had progressively evolved over the past 36 years, 
increasingly affecting the patient's quality of life. At the time of the 
evaluation, psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy had reduced pruritus, but very 
unsightly brown-red maculopapules persisted on the chest, back, and arms. We 
proposed an integrative diagnosis that combined a semistructured interview, a 
psychometric assessment with the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic tool, and 
the collection of medical data. The medical data were compared with the analysis 
of the significant events in the patient's life, to determine the threshold of 
tolerance to stress beyond which the skin symptoms led to profuse thrusts of 
pruritus. At the same time, the psychobehavioral profile of the patient was 
determined; this highlighted how social isolation, the denigrated coping style, 
and problematic compliance could influence the extension of dermatological 
symptoms. The effects of stressors on the infiltration and degranulation of skin 
mast cells have been discussed in light of the neurobiological processes 
currently known. At the end of the evaluation, a new therapeutic strategy was 
proposed.
CONCLUSION: This case report reveals the mind-body relationship of a patient 
suffering from mastocytosis. It highlights the points of vulnerability and the 
adaptative strategies specific to each patient to be considered in therapeutic 
management of other resistant chronic diseases.

While population ageing is rising, the educational composition of the elderly 
remains rather heterogeneous. This study assesses the educational differences in 
future population ageing in Asia and Europe, and how future population ageing in 
Asia and Europe would change if the educational composition of its populations 
changed. A comparative population ageing measure (the Comparative Prospective 
Old-Age Threshold [CPOAT]) was used, which recalculates old-age thresholds after 
accounting for differences in life expectancy, and the likelihood of adults 
surviving to higher ages. Combined data from projected age- and sex-specific 
life-tables (from the United Nations) and projected age- and sex-specific 
survival ratios by different levels of education (from the Wittgenstein Centre 
for Demography and Global Human Capital) were used to construct projected 
life-tables (2015-2020, …, 2045-2050) by educational level and sex for different 
regions of Asia and Europe. Based on these life-tables, future comparative 
prospective old-age thresholds by educational level and sex were calculated. It 
was found that in both Asia and Europe, and among both men and women, the 
projected old-age thresholds are higher for higher educated people than for 
less-educated people. While Europe has a larger projected share of elderly in 
the population than Asia, Europe's older population is better educated. In 
alternative future scenarios in which populations hypothetically have higher 
levels of education, the projected shares of elderly in the population decrease 
across all regions of Asia and Europe, but more so in Asia. The results 
highlight the effectiveness of investing in education as a policy response to 
the challenges associated with population ageing in Asia and Europe. Such 
investments are more effective in the Asian regions, where the educational 
infrastructure is less developed.

Challenges associated with burial, rendering, and cremation have forced horse 
owners to seek alternative mortality disposal methods. While equine mortality 
composting has been successfully demonstrated, industry-wide adoption has been 
limited. Therefore, evaluation of horse owners' and veterinarians' perceptions 
and experience with mortality composting is needed. Two surveys were developed 
to evaluate industry practices and decisive factors regarding equine euthanasia 
and mortality disposal methods. Each survey was designed for a separate 
audience: horse owners or veterinarians serving equines. The surveys were 
advertised as weblinks on relevant Facebook pages, e-newsletters, and email 
listservs. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate models for 
associations and factors influencing decisions surrounding composting. The 
surveys yielded 1,225 and 244 usable responses from horse owners and 
veterinarians, respectively. Respondent demographics were consistent with 
previous survey reports for horse owners and veterinarians in the United States 
with a majority being female between 41 and 60 years of age with long-term 
industry involvement. Horse owners (86%) and veterinarians (84%) that preferred 
chemical euthanasia tended to prefer burial (58% and 42%, respectively) over 
other mortality disposal methods. Only 12% of horse owner respondents had ever 
tried composting and only 25% of veterinarian respondents had ever recommended 
composting. Horse owner (47%) and veterinarian (67%) respondents indicated they 
would be more open to trying and recommending mortality composting if more 
scientific research were available. Equine mortality composting shows potential 
as a primary disposal method for the equine industry. Research and educational 
programs are key to industry-wide acceptance of equine mortality composting.

OBJECTIVE: To calculate and compare the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
research investment for cardiac arrest (CA) to other leading causes of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in the United States (U.S.).
METHODS: A search within NIH RePORTER for 2017 was performed using single common 
resuscitation terms. Grants were individually reviewed and categorized as CA 
research (yes/no) using predefined criteria. DALY were calculated as the sum of 
years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) using all adult 
non-traumatic out-of-hospital CA (OHCA) from the CARES database for 2017. Total 
DALY for the study population were extrapolated to a national level. Leading 
causes of DALY were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study and funding 
data were extracted from the NIH Categorical Spending Report for comparison. The 
outcome measure was U.S. dollars invested per annual DALY.
RESULTS: The search yielded 290 grants, of which 87 (30%) were classified as CA 
research. Total funding for CA research in 2017 was $37.1M. A total of 73,915 
(97%) cases from CARES met study inclusion criteria for the DALY analysis. The 
total DALY following adult OHCA in the U.S. population were 4,335,949 (YLL 
4,332,166, YLD 3784). Per annual DALY, the NIH invested $287 for diabetes, $92 
for stroke, $55 for ischemic heart disease, and $9 for CA research.
CONCLUSION: The NIH investment into CA research is far less than other 
comparable causes of death and disability in the U.S. These results should help 
inform utilization of limited resources to improve public health.

PET using 68Ga-labeled somatostatin receptor (SSTR) ligands adds significant 
information in meningioma patients. 18F-SiTATE is a novel, 18F-labeled 
SSTR-targeting peptide with remarkable imaging properties. Here, we present a 
72-year-old woman with falx meningioma and transosseous extension. 18F-SiTATE 
PET/CT was performed 12 months after the previous 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT with 
comparable quantitative uptake and very good spatial resolution. So far, the 
widespread use of SSTR ligands for NET and meningioma imaging is hampered by 
cost-intensive 68Ge/68Ga generators, low activity amounts, lower spatial 
resolution, and short half-life. 18F-SiTATE might foster widespread use of SSTR 
ligands, overcoming the shortcomings of 68Ga-labeled ligands.

The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically improved the 
outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Currently, four TKIs 
are available for the frontline treatment, including the first-generation TKI 
(imatinib) and the second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib). 
The second-generation TKIs lead to a faster and deeper molecular response 
without a survival benefit compared with imatinib. However, the opportunity for 
the treatment discontinuation and functional cure requires the achievement of 
durable deep molecular remission. Therefore, the second-generation TKIs should 
be considered as initial therapy for chronic-phase CML. Switch of therapy is 
warranted in case of treatment failure, including resistance and/or intolerance. 
The life expectancy of patients with CML is approaching that of the general 
population. Given an expected lifespan, future perspectives should consider the 
strategy for the optimal choice of TKIs, allowing for long-duration of effective 
TKI therapy with less toxicity to aim for a functional cure. A novel prediction 
approach such as artificial intelligence-driven analysis on the accumulated data 
from clinical trials paves a promising path for the personalized recommendation 
on frontline TKIs and precise survival prediction.

BACKGROUND: In economic evaluations, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) can 
serve as a unit of measurement for disease burden. Obtaining QALY values for 
COVID-19 presents a challenge owing to the availability of two US EQ-5D-5L value 
sets and the potentially asymptomatic presentation of the disease. The first 
value set was completed allowing for the discounting of future health outcomes 
while the second value set is undiscounted.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of QALY 
values using a national survey and the two published value sets; and to estimate 
the association between COVID-19 outcomes and QALY losses.
METHODS: Between 9 and 11 November, 2020, 1153 US adults completed the EQ-5D-5L 
instrument (five items and a visual analog scale) as well as self-reported their 
demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and memberships to populations that are at risk 
of COVID-19 infection. The two US value sets were applied to the EQ-5D-5L 
responses to produce QALY values. We estimated the mean QALYs by visual analog 
scale decile and a generalized linear model of COVID-19 outcomes.
RESULTS: The discounted values are higher than the undiscounted values for each 
visual analog scale decile owing to methodological differences. Persons at 
increased risk, with a fever in the past day, and with one or more other 
symptoms have significantly greater QALY losses (p < 0.01). Overall, 
non-institutionalized individuals at risk of symptomatic clinical COVID-19 equal 
0.68 for the 2016 value set (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.87) and 0.10 for the 
2017 value set (95% confidence interval - 0.31 to 0.51) QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple studies have shown that decision makers discount future 
health outcomes, which increase QALY values. This study confronts the practical 
implications of these methodological advances for use in COVID-19 economic 
evaluations. Health economists will be able to use the QALY values in this study 
to better evaluate health interventions against COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Within the UK, standard methods of economic evaluation centre on the 
maximisation of the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). However, preference-based 
measures used to estimate QALYs may not be suited to all economic evaluations, 
as they routinely measure only health outcomes.
AIM: This study used an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial (EEACT) 
comparing patients' preferences for a telephone versus a face-to-face 
consultation to incorporate process utility into cost-effectiveness analyses.
METHODS: An EEACT is described that generates QALYs using Short-form 6-dimension 
version 1 (SF-6Dv1) responses. These results exclude specific consideration of 
process utility. A health state valuation study is then reported that bolts a 
process domain onto the SF-6Dv1 using data obtained from the EEACT. These 
results therefore include the consideration of process utility. The results of 
the EEACT with and without process utility are then compared.
RESULTS: This study shows that the QALY, in its current form, does not capture 
patient benefits associated with the process of receiving healthcare. The EEACT 
illustrates this, showing a statistically significant difference between control 
and intervention groups for the patient experience questionnaire communication 
domain, indicating that patients preferred the intervention. This preference was 
not identified in the cost-effectiveness outcomes, and the point estimates lie 
in the north-west quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane. The preference is 
captured after adding a communication domain. The point estimate moves to the 
north-east quadrant, where the intervention is more effective and more costly 
than the control.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that it is possible to capture patients' 
preferences for processes associated with care, in a format compatible with the 
QALY.

Using a multimethod life history approach to navigate the osteological paradox: 
A case study from Prehispanic Nasca, Peru.

California, USA.

OBJECTIVES: We leverage recent bioarchaeological approaches and life history 
theory to address the implications of the osteological paradox in a study 
population. The goal of this article is to evaluate morbidity and mortality 
patterns as well as variability in the risk of disease and death during the Late 
Intermediate period (LIP; 950-1450 C.E.) in the Nasca highlands of Peru. We 
demonstrate how the concurrent use of multiple analytical techniques and life 
history theory can engage the osteological paradox and provide salient insights 
into the study of stress, frailty, and resilience in past populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crania from LIP burial contexts in the Nasca highlands 
were examined for cribra orbitalia (n = 325) and porotic hyperostosis (n = 270). 
All age groups and both sexes are represented in the sample. 
Survivor/nonsurvivor analysis assessed demographic differences in lesion 
frequency and severity. Hazard models were generated to assess differences in 
survivorship. The relationship between dietary diversity and heterogeneity in 
morbidity was assessed using stable δ15 N and δ13 C isotope values for bone 
collagen and carbonate. One hundred and twenty-four crania were directly AMS 
radiocarbon dated, allowing for a diachronic analysis of morbidity and 
mortality.
RESULTS: The frequency and expression of both orbital and vault lesions 
increases significantly during the LIP. Survivor/nonsurvivor analysis indicates 
cranial lesions co-vary with frailty rather than robusticity or longevity. 
Hazard models show (1) decreasing survivorship with the transition into the LIP, 
(2) significantly lower adult life expectancy for females compared to males, and 
(3) individuals with cranial lesions have lower survivorship across the life 
course. Stable isotope results show very little dietary diversity. Mortality 
risk and frequency of pathological skeletal lesions were highest during Phase 
III (1300-1450 C.E.) of the LIP.
CONCLUSION: Results provide compelling evidence of increasing physiological 
stress and mortality in the Nasca highlands during the LIP, but also reveal 
substantial heterogeneity in frailty and the risk of death. Certain members of 
society experienced a heavier disease burden and higher mortality compared to 
their contemporaries. Elevated levels of disease and lethal trauma among females 
account for some of the sex differences in survivorship but cannot explain the 
large degree of female-biased mortality. We hypothesize that parental investment 
in males or increased female fertility rates may explain these differences.

The health effects of wage setting institutions: How collective bargaining 
improves health but not because it reduces inequality.

Political Science, London, UK.

Do wage-setting institutions, such as collective bargaining, improve health and, 
if so, is this because they reduce income inequality? Wage-setting institutions 
are often assumed to improve health because they increase earnings and reduce 
inequality and yet, while individual-level studies suggest higher earnings 
improve well being, the direct effects of these institutions on mortality 
remains unclear. This paper explores both the relationship between wage-setting 
institutions and mortality rates whether income inequality mediates this 
relationship. Using 50 years of data from 22 high-income countries (n ~ 825), I 
find mortality rates are lower in countries with collective bargaining compared 
to places with little or no wage protection. While wage-setting institutions may 
reduce economic inequality, these institutions do not appear to improve health 
because they reduce inequality. Instead, collective bargaining improves health, 
in part, because they increase average wage growth. The political and economic 
drivers of inequality may not, then, be correlated with health outcomes, and, as 
a result, health scholars need to develop more nuanced theories of the political 
economy of health that are separate from but in dialogue with the political 
economy of inequality.

BACKGROUND: The coupling of increased life expectancy and improvements in both 
quality and access to chronic liver disease care, is culminating in an expanding 
population of septuagenarians (≥70 years) in need of liver transplantation (LT). 
The objective of this study is to partially alleviate this knowledge deficit and 
to add clarity to the current status and role of LDLT in this recipient 
population.
METHODS: Of 295 adult patients underwent LDLT between January 1, 2011 and 
December 31, 2016. Twelve (4%) of these patients were septuagenarians and this 
group was compared to younger cohort (n = 283).
RESULTS: Comorbidity profiles between the two groups were similar and no 
statistically significant differences were noted in warm/cold ischemia times, 
operative duration, or blood product utilization. ICU and total hospital stays 
were comparable. Septuagenarian 1-and 5-year graft and patient survivals were 
identical at 91.7%. Their younger counterparts had 1-and 5-year patient 
survivals of 91.1% and 84.0 % accompanied by 1-and 5-year graft survivals of 
89.8% and 82.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights a recognition that LDLT can afford 
highly-selected elderly patients to access to transplant with equivalent 
outcomes to those realized by younger recipients.

Prognostic tools for identification of high risk in people with Crohn's disease: 
systematic review and cost-effectiveness study.

Edwards SJ, Barton S, Bacelar M, Karner C, Cain P, Wakefield V, Marceniuk G.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a lifelong condition that can affect any segment 
of the gastrointestinal tract. Some people with Crohn's disease may be at higher 
risk of following a severe course of disease than others and being able to 
identify the level of risk a patient has could lead to personalised management.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic test accuracy, clinical impact and 
cost-effectiveness of two tools for the stratification of people with a 
diagnosis of Crohn's disease by risk of following a severe course of disease.
DATA SOURCES: The data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were 
searched to inform the systematic reviews on prognostic accuracy, clinical 
impact of the prognostic tools, and economic evaluations. Additional data 
sources to inform the review of economic evaluations were NHS Economic 
Evaluation Database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health 
Technology Assessment Database.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of electronic databases were carried out from 
inception to June 2019 for studies assessing the prognostic accuracy and 
clinical impact of the IBDX® (Crohn's disease Prognosis Test; Glycominds Ltd, 
Lod, Israel) biomarker stratification tool and the PredictSURE-IBD™ 
(PredictImmune Ltd, Cambridge, UK) tool. Systematic reviews of studies reporting 
on the cost-effectiveness of treatments for Crohn's disease were run from 
inception to July 2019. Two reviewers independently agreed on studies for 
inclusion, assessed the quality of included studies and validated the data 
extracted from studies. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies 
precluded the synthesis of data for prognostic accuracy. A de novo economic 
model was developed to compare the costs and consequences of two treatment 
approaches - the 'top-down' and 'step-up' strategies, with step-up considered 
standard care - in people at high risk of following a severe course of Crohn's 
disease. The model comprised a decision tree and a Markov cohort model.
RESULTS: Sixteen publications, including eight original studies (n = 1478), were 
deemed relevant to the review of prognostic accuracy. Documents supplied by the 
companies marketing the prognostic tools were also reviewed. No study meeting 
the eligibility criteria reported on the sensitivity or specificity of the IBDX 
biomarker stratification tool, whereas one study provided estimates of 
sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value for the PredictSURE-IBD 
tool. All identified studies were observational and were considered to provide 
weak evidence on the effectiveness of the tools. Owing to the paucity of data on 
the two tools, in the base-case analysis the accuracy of PredictSURE-IBD was 
assumed to be 100%. Accuracy of IBDX was assumed to be 100% in a scenario 
analysis, with the cost of the tests being the only difference between the 
analyses. The incremental analysis of cost-effectiveness demonstrated that 
top-down (via the use of PredictSURE-IBD in the model) is more expensive and 
generates fewer quality-adjusted life-years than step-up (via the standard care 
arm of the model).
LIMITATIONS: Despite extensive systematic searches of the literature, no robust 
evidence was identified of the prognostic accuracy of the biomarker 
stratification tools IBDX and PredictSURE-IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the model indicates that standard care dominates the 
tests, the lack of evidence of prognostic accuracy of the two tests and the 
uncertainty around the benefits of the top-down and step-up treatment approaches 
mean that the results should be interpreted as indicative rather than 
definitive.

Plain Language Summary: Crohn’s disease is a condition in which parts of the 
digestive system become inflamed (swollen). People of any age can develop 
Crohn’s disease. It is a lifelong condition for which there is no cure. In the 
UK, Crohn’s disease affects about 1 in every 650 people. Any part of the 
digestive system can be affected, and the severity of the disease can vary from 
person to person. Symptoms come and go, and there can be times when there are no 
symptoms at all. Common symptoms of Crohn’s disease are diarrhoea, stomach-ache 
and blood in faeces. Treatment is given to reduce or control symptoms and to try 
to stop inflammation from coming back. Some people with Crohn’s disease are more 
likely than others to have more relapses and to develop complications of Crohn’s 
disease that might require surgery. This project looked at how well two tools 
worked at identifying people with Crohn’s disease who might develop 
complications or need surgery. Identifying those who have a higher chance of 
experiencing complications of Crohn’s disease could help them and their doctor 
to choose their treatment, with the goal of reducing the number of relapses and 
the risk of surgery in the longer term. In addition, the review assessed whether 
or not the tools offered value for money. We found limited evidence of how well 
the tools worked in identifying people who were more likely to develop 
complications of Crohn’s disease. The lack of evidence on the tools meant that 
the cost-effectiveness analysis could only assess the value for money of the 
treatment that is given in clinical practice at this time or of more intensive 
treatments for people who are more likely to develop complications. The analysis 
found that current standard care offers more value for money than intensive 
treatments for people with a higher chance of developing complications of 
Crohn’s disease.

AIMS: This study aimed at evaluating the age, sex, and country-income patterns 
in aortic aneurysm disease burden, analysing trends in mortality and years of 
life lost (YLLs), as well as their causal drivers and risk factors, using the 
2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2017).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We described the temporal, global, and regional (195 
countries) patterns of aortic aneurysm (thoracic and abdominal) mortality, YLLs, 
their drivers [sociodemographic index (SDI), healthcare access and quality index 
(HAQ index)] and risk factors using the GBD 1990-2017. Correlation and mixed 
multilevel modelling between aortic aneurysm mortality, YLLs, HAQ index and 
other variables were applied. From 1990 to 2017, a global declining trend in 
age-standardized aortic aneurysm mortality was found [2.88 deaths/100 000 (95% 
uncertainty intervals, UI 2.79 to 3.03) in 1990 and 2.19 deaths/100 000 (95% UI 
2.09 to 2.28) in 2017]. Among high-income countries (HICs) a consistent 
declining Spearman's correlation between age-standardised aortic aneurysm 
mortality, SDI (HICs; 1990 rho: 0.57, P ≤ 0.001; 2017 rho: 0.41, P = 0.001) and 
HAQ index was observed (HICs; 1990 rho: 0.50, P <0.001; 2016 rho: 0.35, 
P = 0.006); in comparison with low- and middle-income countries where 
correlation trends were weak and mixed. At a global level, higher HAQ index was 
related with lower aortic aneurysm mortality and YLLs [mortality, coef: -0.05, 
95% confidence interval (CI): -0.06, -0.04; YLLs, coef: -0.94, 95% CI: -1.17, 
-0.71].
CONCLUSIONS: Age-standardized aortic aneurysm mortality declined globally 
between 1990 and 2017. Globally, age-standardized aortic aneurysm mortality and 
YLLs were related to changes in SDI and HAQ index levels, while country-level 
income-related variations were also observed.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Age-related comorbidities and immune activation raise concern 
for advanced brain aging in people living with HIV (PLWH). The brain age index 
(BAI) is a machine learning model that quantifies deviations in brain activity 
during sleep relative to healthy individuals of the same age. High BAI was 
previously found to be associated with neurological, psychiatric, 
cardiometabolic diseases, and reduced life expectancy among people without HIV. 
Here, we estimated the effect of HIV infection on BAI by comparing PLWH and HIV- 
controls.
METHODS: Clinical data and sleep EEGs from 43 PLWH on antiretroviral therapy 
(HIV+) and 3,155 controls (HIV-) were collected from Massachusetts General 
Hospital. The effect of HIV infection on BAI, and on individual EEG features, 
was estimated using causal inference.
RESULTS: The average effect of HIV on BAI was estimated to be +3.35 years (p < 
0.01, 95% CI = [0.67, 5.92]) using doubly robust estimation. Compared to HIV- 
controls, HIV+ participants exhibited a reduction in delta band power during 
deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
CONCLUSION: We provide causal evidence that HIV contributes to advanced brain 
aging reflected in sleep EEG. A better understanding is greatly needed of 
potential therapeutic targets to mitigate the effect of HIV on brain health, 
potentially including sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is one of the most frequent cancerous diseases of the 
hemopoietic system. Over the past 60 years the systemic treatment has undergone 
multiple changes, from alkylating agents to high-dose therapy followed by 
autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation up to immunomodulating 
substances and proteasome inhibitors. The treatment of MM is currently 
undergoing a renewed transition. In recent years monoclonal antibodies have 
decisively extended the treatment options. Long-term remission is achieved more 
often. Due to progress in immuno-oncological treatment the prognosis of 
intensively treated patients with a very short life-expectancy can be improved 
in the future. It is to be expected that MM will be curable in the medium term. 
The concentration of free light chains in serum, lesions in magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and bone marrow infiltration are parameters that are incorporated 
into the treatment indications. In clinical studies patients with smoldering 
myeloma are already being treated to delay progression, to increase the 
remission rates or to achieve long-term remission with negative minimal residual 
disease. Taking the chromosomal alterations and serological parameters into 
consideration, the prognosis of patients with MM can nowadays be very well 
discriminated. In currently running studies high-risk patients are being
