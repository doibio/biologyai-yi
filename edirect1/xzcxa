The current study aims to evaluate the burden of disease in Singapore by 
estimating the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to mental disorders 
and chronic physical conditions. The second Singapore Mental Health Study 
(SMHS-2016) was conducted in 2016 among 6126 respondents aged 18 years and 
above. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview version 3.0 (WHO-CIDI 3.0) and a modified version of the CIDI chronic 
medical disorders checklist were used to assess the 12-month diagnoses of mental 
and chronic physical disorders while the SF-6D scores derived from the 12-item 
Short Form Health Survey instrument was used to estimate the QALYs lost. The 
mean SF-6D score in this population was 0.87. The largest reduction in SF-6D 
scores among people with mental disorders was observed in Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD), followed by Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), alcohol abuse, 
bipolar disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) while the largest 
reduction in SF-6D score among people with chronic physical conditions was 
observed in ulcer, followed by lung disease, chronic pain and cardiovascular 
disease. At the population level, chronic pain was associated with the greatest 
QALY loss followed by MDD (14,204 and 6,889 respectively). Lung disease was 
associated with the smallest QALY loss (376). These findings highlight chronic 
pain, MDD, OCD, cardiovascular disease and GAD as the five leading contributors 
of QALYs lost in the general population which deserve prioritisation in public 
health prevention programmes.

Although chemical deterrents to herbivory often exact costs in terms of plant 
growth, the manner in which those costs arise, and their physiological 
relationship to other functional traits, remain unclear. In the absence of 
appreciable herbivory, we examined interrelationships among chemical defense 
levels and other foliar functional traits (e.g., light-saturated photosynthesis, 
specific leaf area, nitrogen concentration) as co-determinants of tree growth 
and, by extension, competitive ability in high-density populations comprising 16 
genotypes of Populus tremuloides. Across genotypes, concentrations of chemical 
defenses were not significantly related to other leaf functional traits, but 
levels of the salicinoid phenolic glycosides (SPGs) salicin, salicortin and 
tremulacin were each negatively correlated with relative mass growth (RMG) of 
aboveground woody tissue (P ≤ 0.001). RMG, in turn, underpinned 77% of the 
genotypic variation in relative height growth (our index of competitive 
ability). RMG was also positively related to light-saturated photosynthesis 
(P ≤ 0.001), which, together with the three SPGs, explained 86% of genotypic RMG 
variation (P ≤ 0.001). Moreover, results of a carbon balance simulation 
indicated that costs of resource allocation to SPGs, reaching nearly a third of 
annual crown photosynthesis, were likely mediated by substantial metabolic 
turnover, particularly for salicin. The lack of discernible links between foliar 
defense allocation and other (measured) functional traits, and the illustrated 
potential of metabolic turnover to reconcile influences of SPG allocation on 
RMG, shed additional light on fundamental physiological mechanisms underlying 
evolutionary tradeoffs between chemical defense investment and competitive 
ability in a foundation tree species.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Unipolar depression is the most common form of 
depression and demand for treatment, such as psychotherapy, is high. However, 
waiting times for psychotherapy often considerably exceed their recommended 
maximum. As a potentially less costly alternative treatment, internet-based 
cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) might help reduce waiting times. We therefore 
analyzed the cost-utility of ICBT compared to face-to-face CBT (FCBT) as an 
active control treatment, taking differences in waiting time into account.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate costs and health outcomes 
measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for ICBT and FCBT in Germany. We 
modeled a time horizon of 3 years using six states (remission, depressed, 
spontaneous remission, undergoing treatment, treatment finished, death). The 
societal perspective was adopted. We obtained parameters for transition 
probabilities, depression-specific QoL, and cost data from the literature. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Within a 
scenario analysis, we simulated different time-to-treatment combinations. 
Half-cycle correction was applied.
RESULTS: In our simulation, ICBT generated 0.260 QALYs and saved €2536 per 
patient compared to FCBT. Our deterministic sensitivity analysis suggests that 
the base-case results were largely unaffected by parameter uncertainty and are 
therefore robust. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that ICBT is 
highly likely to be more effective (91.5%), less costly (76.0%), and the 
dominant strategy (69.7%) compared to FCBT. The scenario analysis revealed that 
the base-case results are robust to variations in time-to-treatment differences.
CONCLUSION: ICBT has a strong potential to balance demand and supply of CBT in 
unipolar depression by reducing therapist time per patient. It is highly likely 
to generate more QALYs and reduce health care expenditure. In addition, ICBT may 
have further positive external effects, such as freeing up capacities for the 
most severely depressed patients.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we seek to evaluate the population health 
improvements during the previous four decades in Iran. We have estimated the 
levels and trends of child and adult mortality in addition to life expectancy 
from 1979 to 2019 at national and sub-national levels using all the available 
data.
METHODS: In this study, we used data from National and Sub-National Burden of 
Diseases study and employed Bayesian Averaging Model (BAM) to predict mortality 
rates and life expectancy from 1979 to 2019. By including all available data 
sources of death information of Iran, including national level data from the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), national censuses, 
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and Death Registration System (DRS) and 
using Spatio-Temporal and Gaussian Process Regression (ST-GPR) models, we 
estimated mortality rates and life expectancy from 1990 to 2015. We also used a 
BAM to project our desired indices until 2019.
RESULTS: Both child and adult mortality rates decreased dramatically over the 
period. At the national level in Iran, in 2019, child mortality rate (deaths per 
1000 livebirths), was 16.0 (95%UI: 13.0-19.6), adult mortality rates 
[probability of death (%)] for females and males were 6.1 (5.4-6.8) and 11.5 
(10.3-12.8), respectively. Also, life expectancy values for females and males 
were 81.6 (80.7-82.2) and 76.1 (75.3-76.6), respectively. The results were 
consistent for both sexes. Despite the total narrowing gaps among provinces, a 
difference can still be observed particularly for the border provinces regarding 
child mortality rates. However, the difference in the other measures are 
inconsiderable. From 1979 to 2019, the overall change percent in child mortality 
rate, adult mortality rate for females and males and life expectancy for females 
and males were -86.3% (-89.0%--83.1%), -52.5% (-60.9%--42.9%), -48.7% (-56.9%- 
-39.6%), 25.3% (20.8%-31.5%), and 31.3% (25.5%-41.3%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study provides an overview of the previous 40 years of 
mortality rates (child and adult) and life expectancy. The provided framework of 
national and sub-national evaluation can be used by researchers to continue the 
path of providing information for prioritization and evaluation of programs and 
also performing cost-effectiveness analysis for proposing efficient strategies 
to policy makers.

Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Preventing violence is important especially in the Middle East, 
where many countries are struggling with violence. Knowing the affecting factors 
could help public policy makers to decrease violence level. Thus, this study is 
aimed to analyze health and other socio-economic factors that could affect 
interpersonal violence in middle eastern countries.
METHODS: From international organization databases, we collected the panel data 
of Middle Eastern countries from 1990 to 2016 on prevalence of interpersonal 
violence as dependent variable and per capita income, life expectancy, democracy 
index (DI), urbanization and unemployment as explanatory factors. Several panel 
data diagnostic tests were performed for selecting a suitable model of 
estimation. The variables were entered in the model in logarithmic form. Because 
of heteroscedasticity, cross-sectional dependence and serial correlation of 
residuals, feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) was used for estimation of 
mentioned model using Stata 14.2.
RESULTS: The means of interpersonal violence prevalence and life expectancy were 
2462.2 (SD = 232.4) per 100000 population and 73.5 (SD = 4.5) in the Middle 
East, respectively. Urbanization (β = -0.0925, P < 0.01), life expectancy (β = 
-0.0362, P < 0.01), per capita income (β = -0.0046, P < 0.01), unemployment (β = 
0.0007, P < 0.01) and democracy (β = -5.83e-06, P < 0.01) had significant 
relation with interpersonal violence.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy as a proxy for health is one of the main predictors 
of interpersonal violence, as literature supports. That is, if a society is 
healthier, the burden of interpersonal violence will be lower. Thus, health 
policy makers should consider health status as a preventive factor of violence, 
which is stated in health as a bridge for peace by the world health 
organization.

The t-year mean survival or restricted mean survival time (RMST) has been used 
as an appealing summary of the survival distribution within a time window [0, 
t]. RMST is the patient's life expectancy until time t and can be estimated 
nonparametrically by the area under the Kaplan-Meier curve up to t. In a 
comparative study, the difference or ratio of two RMSTs has been utilized to 
quantify the between-group-difference as a clinically interpretable alternative 
summary to the hazard ratio. The choice of the time window [0, t] may be 
prespecified at the design stage of the study based on clinical considerations. 
On the other hand, after the survival data have been collected, the choice of 
time point t could be data-dependent. The standard inferential procedures for 
the corresponding RMST, which is also data-dependent, ignore this subtle yet 
important issue. In this paper, we clarify how to make inference about a random 
"parameter." Moreover, we demonstrate that under a rather mild condition on the 
censoring distribution, one can make inference about the RMST up to t, where t 
is less than or even equal to the largest follow-up time (either observed or 
censored) in the study. This finding reduces the subjectivity of the choice of t 
empirically. The proposal is illustrated with the survival data from a primary 
biliary cirrhosis study, and its finite sample properties are investigated via 
an extensive simulation study.

BACKGROUND: Health system planning requires careful assessment of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) epidemiology, but data for morbidity and mortality of this disease 
are scarce or non-existent in many countries. We estimated the global, regional, 
and national burden of CKD, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease and 
gout attributable to impaired kidney function, for the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017. We use the term CKD to refer to 
the morbidity and mortality that can be directly attributed to all stages of 
CKD, and we use the term impaired kidney function to refer to the additional 
risk of CKD from cardiovascular disease and gout.
METHODS: The main data sources we used were published literature, vital 
registration systems, end-stage kidney disease registries, and household 
surveys. Estimates of CKD burden were produced using a Cause of Death Ensemble 
model and a Bayesian meta-regression analytical tool, and included incidence, 
prevalence, years lived with disability, mortality, years of life lost, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). A comparative risk assessment approach 
was used to estimate the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and gout burden 
attributable to impaired kidney function.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2017, 1·2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·2 to 
1·3) people died from CKD. The global all-age mortality rate from CKD increased 
41·5% (95% UI 35·2 to 46·5) between 1990 and 2017, although there was no 
significant change in the age-standardised mortality rate (2·8%, -1·5 to 6·3). 
In 2017, 697·5 million (95% UI 649·2 to 752·0) cases of all-stage CKD were 
recorded, for a global prevalence of 9·1% (8·5 to 9·8). The global all-age 
prevalence of CKD increased 29·3% (95% UI 26·4 to 32·6) since 1990, whereas the 
age-standardised prevalence remained stable (1·2%, -1·1 to 3·5). CKD resulted in 
35·8 million (95% UI 33·7 to 38·0) DALYs in 2017, with diabetic nephropathy 
accounting for almost a third of DALYs. Most of the burden of CKD was 
concentrated in the three lowest quintiles of Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In 
several regions, particularly Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, 
the burden of CKD was much higher than expected for the level of development, 
whereas the disease burden in western, eastern, and central sub-Saharan Africa, 
east Asia, south Asia, central and eastern Europe, Australasia, and western 
Europe was lower than expected. 1·4 million (95% UI 1·2 to 1·6) cardiovascular 
disease-related deaths and 25·3 million (22·2 to 28·9) cardiovascular disease 
DALYs were attributable to impaired kidney function.
INTERPRETATION: Kidney disease has a major effect on global health, both as a 
direct cause of global morbidity and mortality and as an important risk factor 
for cardiovascular disease. CKD is largely preventable and treatable and 
deserves greater attention in global health policy decision making, particularly 
in locations with low and middle SDI.

After a brief semantic and historical presentation, the article presents the 
main trials and systematic reviews on the tertiary prevention and care of 
cancers through physical activity. It gives the keys to understanding how, in 
forty years of research, interventions dedicated to prevent physical inactivity 
to reduce the risk of cancer have become as indispensable as adapted physical 
activity (APA) programs for care pathways. If the public health message "move 
more" with or without cancer remains true, the research encourages practitioners 
to implement personalized programs in primary prevention, in addition to 
treatment and prevention of recurrence. As soon as the diagnosis is made, APA 
programs will become truly supportive care complementary of treatments, in other 
words non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), with the aim of improving the 
quality of life of patients, improving their overall health, reducing side 
effects of treatment, potentiate the effects of certain treatments, and reduce 
the risk of recurrence. Research remains to be carried out notably on the 
survival, on the advanced cancers and on the integrative modelling of the 
mechanisms involved.

The oft-applied assumption in the use of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in 
economic evaluation, that all QALYs are valued equally, has been questioned from 
the outset. The literature has focused on differential values of a QALY based on 
equity considerations such as the characteristics of the beneficiaries of the 
QALYs. However, a key characteristic which may affect the value of a QALY is the 
type of QALY itself. QALY gains can be generated purely by gains in survival, 
purely by improvements in quality of life, or by changes in both. Using a 
discrete choice experiment and a new methodological approach to the derivation 
of relative weights, we undertake the first direct and systematic exploration of 
the relative weight accorded different QALY types and do so in the presence of 
equity considerations; age and severity. Results provide new evidence against 
the normative starting point that all QALYs are valued equally.

BACKGROUND: >Despite advances in drug development, life expectancy in idiopathic 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) remains unacceptable. Contemporary IPAH 
characterization is based on criteria that may not adequately capture disease 
heterogeneity and may be proposed as a possible explanation for why patient 
outcome is still unfavorable. The aim of this study was to apply cluster 
analysis to improve phenotyping of patients with IPAH and analyze long-term 
clinical outcome of derived clusters.
METHODS: Patients with IPAH from 2 referral centers (n = 252) were evaluated 
with clinical, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic assessment and cardiopulmonary 
exercise test. Patients were classified according to cluster analysis and 
followed for clinical worsening occurrence.
RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified 4 IPAH phenotypes. Cluster 1 was 
characterized by young patients, mild pulmonary hypertension (PH), mild right 
ventricular (RV) dilation and high oxygen (O2) pulse; Cluster 2 by severe PH and 
RV dilation and high O2 pulse; and Cluster 3 by male patients, severe PH and RV 
dilation, and low O2 pulse. Cluster 4 patients were older and overweight, with 
mild PH and RV dilation and low O2 pulse. After a mean follow-up of 995 ± 623 
days, 123 (48.8%) patients had clinical worsening. Cluster 1 patients presented 
the best prognosis, whereas Cluster 3 had the highest rates of clinical 
worsening. Compared with Cluster 1, risk of clinical worsening ranged from 4.12 
(confidence interval [CI] 1.43-11.92; p = 0.009) for Cluster 4 to 7.38 (CI 
2.80-19.40) for Cluster 2 and 13.8 (CI 5.60-34.0; p = 0.0001) for Cluster 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis of clinical variables identified 4 distinct 
phenotypes of IPAH. Our findings underscore the high degree of disease 
heterogeneity that exists within patients with IPAH and the need for advanced 
clinical testing to define phenotypes to improve treatment strategy 
decision-making. CONDENSED ABSTRACT Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(IPAH) characterization is based on criteria that may not adequately capture 
disease heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to apply cluster analysis to 
improve phenotyping of IPAH. Patients with IPAH (n = 252) were evaluated with 
clinical, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic assessment and cardiopulmonary 
exercise test. Within the umbrella category of IPAH, it was the combination of 
mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular size, and oxygen pulse that 
further stratified patients into novel IPAH phenotypes that significantly 
associate with clinical worsening. These findings underscore the need for novel 
multidimensional IPAH phenotyping for improved patient care and trial quality.

BACKGROUND: Loss of life expectancy (LOLE) provides valuable insights into the 
impact of cancer. We evaluated the temporal trends in LOLE for Australian cancer 
patients and the gain in life years for recently diagnosed patients due to 
survival improvements.
METHODS: Analysis was conducted using an Australian population-based cohort (n = 
1,865,154) aged 50-89 years, who were primarily diagnosed with one of 19 leading 
cancers between 1982-2015. Flexible parametric survival models were used to 
estimate LOLE and the proportion of life lost (POLL) by year, age group, sex, 
and, for New South Wales only, spread of disease. The total years of LOLE and 
gain in life years due to survival improvements were estimated for those 
diagnosed in 2014.
RESULTS: For 19 cancers combined, LOLE and POLL were significantly lower for 
more recent diagnoses. Cancer-specific temporal trends were consistent by age, 
sex, and spread of disease (where relevant) although the magnitude varied. 
Prostate, kidney, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma experienced the largest decreases in 
POLL over time. For the 2014 diagnoses, an estimation of 403,094 life years lost 
will be caused by the 19 cancers. With the increase in cancer survival over 
time, the 2014 cohort will gain an extra 432,588 life years (52 %) compared to 
that experienced by the 1982 cohort.
CONCLUSION: While reduced impact of a cancer diagnosis on LOLE over time is 
encouraging, the growing number of cancer survivors in Australia is likely to 
pose complex challenges for cancer patients, their care givers, and health-care 
systems.

Each year, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) computes the Global Liveability 
Index and determines the most liveable cities around the world. Vienna, Austria, 
was ranked by the EIU as the most liveable city worldwide in 2018 and 2019. 
However, the relationship between a liveable as well as healthy and 
environmentally-just city has not been previously explored. To explore whether 
the most liveable city is also a healthy and environmentally-just one, we 
estimated the premature mortality burden related to non-compliance with 
international exposure level recommendations for physical activity (PA), air 
pollution (PM2.5 and NO2), road traffic noise, green space and heat for Vienna, 
as well as its distribution by socioeconomic status (SES). We applied the Urban 
and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) methodology and 
estimated the annual mortality, life expectancy (LE) and economic impact of 
non-compliance with exposure guidelines for the Viennese adult population ≥ 20 
years. We compared current with recommended exposure levels, quantified the 
association between exposures and mortality and calculated attributable health 
impact fractions. Eight percent of premature mortality (i.e. 1239 deaths, 95% 
CI: 679-1784) was estimated to be attributable to non-compliance with the 
recommended exposure levels. Seventy-six percent of the attributable premature 
mortality was due to PM2.5 exposure and insufficient PA. Non-compliance also 
resulted in an average of 199 days of LE lost for the adult population (95% CI: 
111-280) and an economic impact of 4.6 (95% CI: 2.5-6.7) billion 2015€ annually. 
Overall, residents of lower SES neighbourhoods faced higher risk of premature 
mortality due to higher exposure to NO2, road traffic noise, heat and less green 
space. Despite high liveability standards according to EIU definition, a 
considerable premature mortality burden was attributable to non-compliance with 
exposure recommendations, and socioeconomic inequalities were estimated. 
Although the exposure attributable mortality burden was lower than in other 
European cities and local Viennese policies favour the reduction of motorized 
traffic, alongside the promotion of active and public transport and urban 
greening, there is room for further alignment of liveability, environmental 
health and justice objectives.

PURPOSE: Improved medical care throughout childhood and adolescence has enabled 
patients with complex urological abnormalities to live longer into adulthood. 
These patients are now at risk of developing common, age-related, urological 
conditions. This review aims to review existing data and make recommendations in 
areas where expert opinion is currently lacking METHODS: This review represents 
the joint SIU-ICUD (Société Internationale d'Urologie-International Consultation 
on Urological Disease) consultation on congenital lifelong urology. The results 
of this analysis were first presented at a joint consultation of the ICUD and 
SIU at the 2018 SIU annual conference in Seoul, South Korea.
RESULTS: BPH may present differently in patients with neurogenic bladder. 
Thorough assessment of neurological status, bladder and sphincter function is 
required before offering any bladder outlet surgery. Prostate specific antigen 
screening should be offered to men aged 50-69 with neurogenic bladders if they 
have good life expectancy. Multi-parametric MRI and transperineal biopsy would 
be the investigations of choice if feasible. Surgery for localized disease 
should only be done by surgeons with the relevant expertise. Bladder cancer in 
this patient group is more likely to present at a later stage and have a worse 
prognosis. Parenthood is achievable for most, but often requires assistance with 
conception. Pregnant women who have had previous urogenital reconstructive 
surgery should be managed in appropriate obstetric units with the involvement of 
a reconstructive urologist.
CONCLUSIONS: Most evidence regarding complex urogenital abnormalities comes from 
the pediatric population. Evidence regarding common, age-related urological 
issues is generally from the 'normal' adult population. As patients with complex 
congenital urological conditions live longer, more data will become available to 
assess the long-term benefits of intervention.

At the beginning of the founding of People's Republic of China, infectious 
diseases, such as smallpox, plague, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, measles, 
diphtheria, pertussis, meningitis, mumps, schistosomiasis, Kala Azar, 
hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis, encephalitis B, typhus, malaria, Kala Azar, 
leprosy, scarlet fever and pinkeye, remained as epidemic in the country and 
endangered people's health. During the past 70 years, the Chinese government 
spent huge efforts in infectious disease prevention and treatment by 
promulgating and implementing series of relative policies, laws and strategies, 
and also encouraged all Chinese people to participate in. The achievements of 
these efforts in controlling infectious disease epidemic were extremely 
successful. Today, the outbreaks and epidemic of infectious diseases in China 
were rarely happened with the rapid decreases in incidence and mortality rates 
of all notifiable infectious diseases. Smallpox was eradicated, and polio, 
filariasis, leprosy and neonatal tetanus were nearly eradicated. In addition, 
the incidence rates of vaccine-preventable diseases, i.e. measles, diphtheria, 
pertussis, meningitis, encephalitis B, hepatitis A, mumps, rubella, 
tuberculosis, were dramatically decreased and remained at relatively low levels 
for years. The incidence and prevalence rates of hepatitis B infection in 
Children decreased significantly and reached the phase objectives. Moreover, 
incidence rates of natural iatrogenic infectious diseases, i.e. diarrhea, 
typhoid and other intestinal infectious diseases, leptospirosis and 
schistosomiasis, and vectorborne diseases, i.e. typhus, malaria, Kala Azar, 
reached the lowest and some even closed to be eliminated in China. In general, 
infectious diseases dropped to the tenth from the top one leading cause of all 
deaths, which means that the achievement of Chinese infectious disease 
prevention and treatment strategies contributed tremendously in improving 
Chinese people's health status and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease has been imposing a heavy economic burden on 
public health; however, few studies have been performed on the 
cost-effectiveness of dialysis modalities. We aim to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of different dialysis modalities in China.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using Markov models based on 
published data of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) modalities in 
China. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify key variables influencing 
the results.
RESULTS: Over a 10-year time horizon, the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis 
indicated that PD-first absolutely dominated the HD-first option by gaining 0.13 
more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costing RMB ¥81,081 less. When 
using reported mortality of HD and PD from the United States, the PD-first 
option still dominated HD-first with higher QALYs and lower costs. Sensitivity 
analyses revealed that the results were more sensitive to the direct cost of HD, 
utility of HD, utility of PD, direct cost of PD, PD mortality, and HD mortality, 
while less sensitive to the indirect costs and transition probabilities. The HD 
utility needed to be at least 0.148 higher than PD utility for HD to be 
cost-effective. PD was about 72% likely to be considered cost-effective compared 
with HD, regardless of the willingness-to-pay for QALYs.
CONCLUSION: PD appears to be more cost-effective than HD in China, and the major 
influential factors on the cost-effectiveness are the direct costs of HD, 
utility of HD, utility of PD, direct costs of PD, PD mortality, and HD 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Symptom perception in heart failure has recently been described as 
essential in the self-care process bridging self-care maintenance and self-care 
management. Accordingly, symptom perception appears to be critical for improving 
patient outcomes such as decreased hospital readmission and increased survival.
OBJECTIVES: To explore what interventions have been reported on heart failure 
symptom perception and to describe outcomes responsive to symptom perception.
DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA Extension for Scoping 
Reviews.
DATA SOURCES: Structured searches of Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, 
Web of Science, Cochrane, Joanna Briggs Institute and Grey literature databases.
REVIEW METHODS: Two authors independently screened references for eligibility. 
Eligible articles were written in English, French, German, Swedish, Italian or 
Spanish and concerned symptom perception in adults with heart failure. Data were 
extracted and charted in tables by three reviewers. Results were narratively 
summarized.
RESULTS: We identified 99 eligible studies from 3055 references. Seven 
interventional studies targeted symptom perception as the single intervention 
component. Mixed results have been found: while some reported decreased symptom 
frequency, intensity and distress, enhanced health-related quality of life, 
improved heart failure self-care maintenance and management as well as a greater 
ability to mention heart failure symptoms, others found more contacts with 
healthcare providers or no impact on anxiety, heart failure self-care nor a 
number of diary reported symptoms. Additional interventional studies included 
symptom perception as one component of a multi-faceted intervention. Outcomes 
responsive to symptom perception were improved general and physical health, 
decreased mortality, heart failure decompensation, as hospital/emergency visits, 
shorter delays in seeking care, more consistent weight monitoring, improved 
symptom recognition as well as self-care management, decreased hospital length 
of stay and decreased costs.
CONCLUSIONS: While many studies allowed to map a comprehensive overview of 
interventions supporting symptom perception in heart failure as well as 
responsiveness to outcomes, only a few single component intervention studies 
targeting symptom perception have been reported and study designs preclude 
assessing intervention effectiveness. With regard to multiple component 
interventions, the specific impact of symptom perception interventions on 
outcomes remains uncertain to date. Well-designed studies are needed to test the 
effectiveness of symptom perception interventions and to elucidate relationships 
with outcomes.

BACKGROUND: inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) are widely used to prevent 
thromboembolic events in patients not suitable for anticoagulation (AC). 
Although new generations of filters are optional and therefore retrievable, most 
of them become permanent. Aim of our study was to evaluate real life IVCF 
management in a tertiary hospital including retrieval rates and reasons for 
permanent filtering.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic charts from patients receiving IVCF in a Swiss 
university hospital, during 1999-2017, were retrospectively identified. Patients 
were classified in two groups, according to filter retrieval (RG) or not (NRG). 
Type and reasons of filter placement were assessed. Retrieval, complications, 
and mortality rates were calculated. Reasons of non-retrieval were analyzed.
RESULTS: 920 patients received an IVCF during 1999-2017. Filters were retrieved 
in 372 patients (40.65%). Subjects in the NRG were significantly older, more 
chronically ill, and presented higher mortality rate at 12 months following 
filter insertion (29.60% vs. 4.30%; p < 0.001). Reasons for non-retrieval 
included lack of follow-up (22.34%), persistent contraindications to AC 
(20.51%), technical issues (17.40%), and severe morbidity with short life 
expectancy (17.22%). Overall, complication rates after filter placement was 
18.58%. Most reported complication was filter thrombosis (15.60%).
CONCLUSIONS: In a real life setting, optional IVCF are still too often left in 
place indefinitely. Need for a systematic follow-up to ensure prompt filter 
retrieval is warranted. IVCF are not retrieved mostly in chronically and more 
severely ill patients, likely accounting for higher mortality in these subjects.
