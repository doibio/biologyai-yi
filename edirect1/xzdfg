Objective: Femoral nerve palsy occurs after trauma, surgical procedures and 
tumors and leads to loss of quadriceps functions, disability and decreased 
quality of life. The aim of this report was to describe a successful restoration 
of knee extension by transferring the anterior branch of the obturator nerve to 
selective branches of the femoral nerve at the thigh level.Methods: We describe 
a 27-year-old male who had quadriceps femoris muscle paralysis after surgical 
evacuation for retroperitoneal hematoma five months ago. Since proximal stump of 
femoral nerve was not accessible, we transferred anterior branch of obturator 
nerve to selective branches of femoral nerve for reconstruction of quadriceps 
femoris muscle.Results: After four months, he regained quadriceps muscle 
strength M3 and began to walk. He achieved full muscle strength (M5) nine months 
after surgery and was able to walk up-stairs easily 14 months after surgery and 
atrophy of the quadriceps was improved.Conclusion: The anterior branch of the 
obturator nerve is an available donor nerve with an excellent functional 
recovery for the reconstruction of knee extension when proximal stump of femoral 
nerve is not reachable or the repair needs a long graft.

BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the cost-utility of four common surgical 
treatment pathways for breast cancer: mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy 
(BCT), implant breast reconstruction (BR) and autologous-BR.
METHODS: Patient-level healthcare consumption data and results of a large 
quality of life (QoL) study from five Dutch hospitals were combined. The 
cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of incremental costs and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year follow-up period. Costs were assessed 
from a healthcare provider perspective.
RESULTS: BCT resulted in comparable QoL with lower costs compared to implant-BR 
and autologous-BR and showed better QoL with higher costs than mastectomy 
(€17,246/QALY). QoL outcomes and costs of especially autologous-BR were affected 
by the relatively high occurrence of complications. If reconstruction following 
mastectomy was performed, implant-BR was more cost-effective than autologous-BR.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of complications had a substantial effect on costs 
and QoL outcomes of different surgical pathways for breast cancer. When this was 
taken into account, BCT was most the cost-effective treatment. Even with higher 
costs and a higher risk of complications, implant-BR and autologous-BR remained 
cost-effective over mastectomy. This pleas for adapting surgical pathways to 
individual patient preferences in the trade-off between the risks of 
complications and expected outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The recent slowdown in life expectancy increase in Australia has 
occurred concurrently with widening socioeconomic and geographical inequalities 
in all-cause mortality risk. We analysed whether, and to what extent, mortality 
inequalities among specific non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Australia at 
ages 35-74 years widened during 2006-16.
METHODS: Registered deaths that occurred during 2006-16 in Australia were 
analysed. Inequalities were measured by area socioeconomic quintile [ranging 
from Q1 (lowest) to Q5 (highest)] and remoteness (major cities, inner regional, 
outer regional/remote/very remote). Age-standardized death rates (ASDR) for 
35-74 years were calculated and smoothed over time.
RESULTS: NCD mortality inequalities by area socioeconomic quintile widened; the 
ratio of Q1 to Q5 ASDR for males increased from 1.96 [95% confidence interval 
(CI) 1.91-2.01] in 2011 to 2.08 (2.03-2.13) in 2016, and for females from 1.78 
(1.73-1.84) to 1.96 (1.90-2.02). Moreover, Q1 NCD ASDRs did not clearly decline 
from 2011 to 2016. CVD mortality inequalities were wider than for all NCDs. 
There were particularly large increases in smoking-related mortality 
inequalities. In 2016, mortality inequalities were especially high for chronic 
respiratory diseases, alcohol-related causes and diabetes. NCD mortality rates 
outside major cities were higher than within major cities, and these differences 
widened during 2006-16. Higher mortality rates in inner regional areas than in 
major cities were explained by socioeconomic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Widening of inequalities in premature mortality rates is a major 
public health issue in Australia in the context of slowing mortality decline. 
Inequalities are partly explained by major risk factors for CVDs and NCDs: being 
overweight or obese, lack of exercise, poor diet and smoking. There is a need 
for urgent policy responses that consider socioeconomic disadvantage.

For the past two decades, consumer demand for minimally processed seafoods with 
good sensory acceptability and nutritive properties has been increasing. 
Nonthermal food processing and preservation technologies have drawn the 
attention of food scientists and manufacturers because nutritional and sensory 
properties of such treated foods are minimally affected. More importantly, 
shelf-life is extended as nonthermal treatments are capable of inhibiting or 
killing both spoilage and pathogenic organisms. They are also considered to be 
more energy-efficient and to yield better quality when compared with 
conventional thermal processes. This review provides insight into the nonthermal 
processing technologies currently used for shelf-life extension of seafoods. 
Both pretreatments such as acidic electrolyte water and ozonification and 
processing technologies, including high hydrostatic pressurization, ionizing 
radiation, cold plasma, ultraviolet light, and pulsed electric fields, as well 
as packaging technology, particularly modified atmosphere packaging, have been 
implemented to lower the microbial load in seafood. Thus, those technologies may 
be the ideal approach for the seafood industry, in which prime quality is 
maintained and safety is assured for consumers.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the impact of treatment-related morbidity 
on long-term, cause-specific mortality in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients.
METHODS: This multicenter cohort included 4919 HL patients, treated before age 
51 years between 1965 and 2000, with a median follow-up of 20.2 years. 
Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess mortality (AEM) per 10 000 
person-years, and cause-specific cumulative mortality by stage and primary 
treatment, accounting for competing risks, were calculated.
RESULTS: HL patients experienced a 5.1-fold (AEM = 123 excess deaths per 10 000 
person-years) higher risk of death due to causes other than HL. This risk 
remained increased in 40-year survivors (standardized mortality ratio = 5.2, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 4.2 to 6.5, AEM = 619). At age 54 years, HL survivors 
experienced similar cumulative mortality (20.0%) from causes other than HL to 
71-year-old individuals from the general population. Whereas HL mortality 
statistically significantly decreased over the calendar period (P < .001), solid 
tumor mortality did not change in the most recent treatment era. Patients 
treated in 1989-2000 had lower 25-year cardiovascular disease mortality than 
patients treated in 1965-1976 (4.3% vs 5.7%; subdistribution hazard ratio = 
0.65, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.93). Infectious disease mortality was not only 
increased after splenectomy but also after spleen irradiation (hazard ratio = 
2.81, 95% CI = 1.55 to 5.07). For stage I-II, primary treatment with 
chemotherapy (CT) alone was associated with statistically significantly higher 
HL mortality (P < .001 for CT vs radiotherapy [RT]; P = .04 for CT vs RT+CT) but 
lower 30-year mortality from causes other than HL (15.8%, 95% CI = 9.7% to 
23.3%) compared with RT alone (36.9%, 95% CI = 34.0% to 39.8%, P = .001) and RT 
and CT combined (29.8%, 95% CI = 26.8% to 32.9%, P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, HL survivors have a 
substantially reduced life expectancy. Optimal selection of patients for primary 
CT is crucial, weighing risks of HL relapse and long-term toxicity.

AIMS: Since dietary sodium intake has been identified as a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease and premature death, a high sodium intake can be expected 
to curtail life span. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the relationship 
between sodium intake and life expectancy as well as survival in 181 countries 
worldwide.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We correlated age-standardized estimates of 
country-specific average sodium consumption with healthy life expectancy at 
birth and at age of 60 years, death due to non-communicable diseases and 
all-cause mortality for the year of 2010, after adjusting for potential 
confounders such as gross domestic product per capita and body mass index. We 
considered global health estimates as provided by World Health Organization. 
Among the 181 countries included in this analysis, we found a positive 
correlation between sodium intake and healthy life expectancy at birth 
(β = 2.6 years/g of daily sodium intake, R2 = 0.66, P < 0.001), as well as 
healthy life expectancy at age 60 (β = 0.3 years/g of daily sodium intake, R2 = 
0.60, P = 0.048) but not for death due to non-communicable diseases (β = 17 
events/g of daily sodium intake, R2 = 0.43, P = 0.100). Conversely, all-cause 
mortality correlated inversely with sodium intake (β = -131 events/g of daily 
sodium intake, R2 = 0.60, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis restricted to 46 
countries in the highest income class, sodium intake continued to correlate 
positively with healthy life expectancy at birth (β = 3.4 years/g of daily 
sodium intake, R2 = 0.53, P < 0.001) and inversely with all-cause mortality (β = 
-168 events/g of daily sodium intake, R2 = 0.50, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our observation of sodium intake correlating positively with life 
expectancy and inversely with all-cause mortality worldwide and in high-income 
countries argues against dietary sodium intake being a culprit of curtailing 
life span or a risk factor for premature death. These data are observational and 
should not be used as a base for nutritional interventions.

Environmental quality has become a growing concern for Chinese society since the 
last 2 decades in China. The large contribution of different pollutants severely 
affected the environmental quality that untimely affects life expectancy in the 
country. In this backdrop, the present study investigates the impact of 
environmental quality and public spending on the environment for life expectancy 
in China using the period 1999Q1-2017Q4. We employ nonlinear autoregressive 
distributed lag model (ARDL) approach for the empirical assessment. The outcomes 
of the study reveal the existence of a long-run relationship between 
environmental quality, public spending on the environment and life expectancy in 
China. The empirical finding reported that life expectancy reacts differently in 
response to positive and negative shocks of environmental quality both in the 
long- and short-run. Environmental quality and spending on the environment 
increase the life expectancy, furthermore, population has a positive and 
significant association with life expectancy only in short run while in long run 
it does not affect. Hence, the government needs to roll out policies to enhance 
environmental quality and ensure adequate funding for environmental 
preservation, to achieve both longevity of society and sustainability of the 
eco-system.

INTRODUCTION: Throughout history, sociocultural changes, improves in life 
expectancy, among other factors have been changing the way people look at with 
disabilities. Family and society play a fundamental role in the conception of 
the disabled member.
OBJECTIVE: Develop and describe how families and society considered children 
with disabilities at different historical moments. Describe how the family with 
members with disabilities interact with the social and cultural context that 
surrounds.
METHOD: A literature review was carried out based on keywords in the MEDLINE 
(PubMed), SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases.
CONCLUSION: Considering families with a child with a disability at different 
historical moments was not always the same. The limitations of the context and 
the socio-historical moment in which both the family and a member with 
disabilities are located can condition the optimal development of the person.

This study aimed to describe the nurse's role in the transition processes of 
adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents. Cystic fibrosis is a 
multisystem, life-shortening genetic disease, caused by malfunction of the 
protein-encoding gene Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, 
characterized by a disturbance of external secretion glands. Moreover, the 
potential presence of respiratory, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and 
reproductive-related symptomatology in these patients can add a substantial 
burden to the disease. In Portugal, the prevalence rate is 1:7,963 of newborns 
and the life expectancy is around 40 years. Because of the disease 
multiple-related symptoms, sometimes disabling, health teams include different 
professionals, with nurses being the main responsible for caring for adolescents 
with Cystic Fibrosis and providing guidance to their parents. A qualitative 
paradigm of phenomenological type was designed. A total of 20 semi-structured 
interviews were conducted with participants selected through the snowball 
technique. Content analysis was performed as proposed by Bardin. The average age 
of participants ranged between 28 and 53 years, and the average time of 
professional exercise ranged between 5 and 27 years. From the analysis of the 
interviews, the category Nurse's Role emerged, followed by the subcategories, 
identify needs, caring, communicate, train, continuity of care, teamwork, care 
partnership, promoting standardization. Nurses identified the nature of the 
nursing role as a strong determinant to facilitate monitoring and intervention 
processes for adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents. Nursing 
therapeutics aim to promote, prevent, and effectively contribute to the 
development process and recovery of stability and well-being of adolescents with 
cystic fibrosis and their parents.

University, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most commonly performed 
orthopedic surgeries in the lower extremity. However, patient dissatisfaction 
and functional disability are mostly experienced because of pain and limited 
range of motion (ROM). Although manual therapy is commonly implemented to 
improve ROM and modulate pain in the management of musculoskeletal disorders, 
there is a lack of evidence about its clinical effectiveness on postoperative 
TKA rehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of an exercise program combined with 
manual therapy compared with an exercise program only for pain, ROM, function, 
quality of life, and patient satisfaction outcomes.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: Rehabilitation unit of a university hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two patients (68.45 ± 6.3 years) scheduled for unilateral 
TKA as a treatment of severe osteoarthritis.
INTERVENTIONS: Joint and soft tissue mobilizations in addition to exercise 
therapy were provided to the mobilization group (n = 21) while the control group 
received exercise therapy only (n = 21).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were numeric pain-rating scale, knee 
ROMs, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 
score, 10-meter walk test (10MWT), 5-times sit to stand test (5SST), and Short 
Form-12 (SF-12).
RESULTS: Improvements in pain outcomes were significantly higher in the 
mobilization group than in the control group (P = .001, F [3, 33] = 7.06) and 
the between-group difference in change score was 1.3 points (P = .001). Although 
the between-group difference in change score was 12.8° for knee flexion at 2 
months (P = .001), the overall group-by-time interactions were not significant 
for flexion and extension ROMs (P = .175, F [3, 33] = 1.75 and P = .57, F [2, 
34] = 0.56, respectively). Additionally, there were statistically meaningful 
group-by-time interactions on total WOMAC score (P = .006, F [2, 34] = 5.29), 
10MWT (P = .002, F [3, 33] = 5.98), and SF-12 mental component summary (P = .01, 
F [2, 34] = 4.92) favoring the mobilization group. Also, patient satisfaction 
was higher in the mobilization group (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: A structured exercise program combined with manual therapy can be 
more beneficial in improving pain, function, and patient satisfaction compared 
to exercise program alone for postoperative TKA patients.

BACKGROUND: The American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition staging 
guidelines for testicular cancer established a 3 cm cutoff to subclassify stage 
T1 seminomas (<3 cm = pT1a and ≥3 cm = pT1b). The efficacy of this cutoff in 
predicting metastatic disease and impact on treatment patterns have not been 
studied.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with pT1 testicular seminoma in 
the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2016. Receiver operating curves were 
used to determine the efficacy of the 3 cm tumor cutoff in identifying 
metastatic disease, and multivariable regression was used to compute the effect 
of tumor size on the rate of adjuvant therapy among Stage I patients.
RESULTS: A total of 10,134 patients with pT1 seminoma were evaluated. The 
current size cutoff of 3 cm for subclassification did not exhibit high 
discrimination in identifying metastatic disease (area under receiver operating 
curve: 0.546). Surveillance has grown as the preferred treatment after 
orchiectomy -32.1% in 2004 to 81.2% in 2015. However, the rate of adjuvant 
therapy for pT1, Stage I seminomas associated positively with tumor size even 
with adjustment for year of diagnosis. For tumors above 3 cm, the odds ratio 
stabilized around 1.9. By using the 3 cm cutoff to guide adjuvant therapy, up to 
85% of T1b patients may be overtreated.
CONCLUSION: The 3 cm cutoff for subclassification of Stage I seminoma does not 
predict metastatic recurrence but is associated with increased receipt of 
adjuvant therapy. A 3 cm cutoff and the pT1a/b classification may therefore 
contribute to overtreatment in many young patients with a long life expectancy 
for whom minimizing adverse effects should be prioritized.

[Hospital Discharge Arrangements for Very Elderly Patients with Chronic Subdural 
Hematoma].

[Article in Japanese]

INTRODUCTION: Chronic subdural hematoma(CSDH)is a common condition encountered 
by neurosurgeons. Owing to increasing life expectancy and rapid population 
aging, the age at disease onset is delayed, which negatively affects hospital 
discharge arrangements. This retrospective study investigated patients aged ≥90 
years who underwent surgery for CSDH.
SUBJECTS AND METHOD: The study included 53 patients diagnosed with CSDH(63 
sides)for the first time, who underwent surgery at our hospital between April 
2018 and March 2019. The mean age was 78.7 years, and the study included 40 men. 
A subdural drain was placed after burr hole surgery performed for hematoma 
evacuation and lavage. The basic protocol included 8-day hospitalization 
comprising surgery on the day of admission, rehabilitation initiated the day 
after surgery, and suture removal 7 days after surgery, followed by hospital 
discharge. The 'elderly' group(Group E)included patients aged ≥90 years, and the 
'others' group(Group O)included patients aged <90 years. This study focused on 
hospital discharge arrangements.
RESULTS: The mean length of hospitalization was 7.6 days in 10 patients(19%)in 
Group E. The rate of intervention by a discharge support nurse or medical social 
worker(Medical Consultation Team)was 100% in Group E and 65% in Group O. All 
patients were discharged to planned living arrangements with the assistance of 
the Medical Consultation Team and rehabilitation intervention.
CONCLUSION: Among elderly patients, difficulties with hospital discharge 
arrangements could be attributed to exacerbation of dementia symptoms after 
hospitalization and manifestations of disuse syndrome and complications. 
Surgical treatment can be offered to patients with CSDH regardless of age(even 
to those aged >90 years)and facilitates smooth discharge with multidisciplinary 
intervention.

Cold Atmospheric Plasma is a non-thermal processing technology with great 
potential for application to food products as it can effectively reduce the 
microbial load, leading to substantial shelf-life extension. Herein, we present 
an easy-to-build and cost-effective Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD) 
plasma source adjusted to the plastic lid of a common commercial food container 
made of transparent glass. Implementation and evaluation of plasma treatment in 
real perishable food products such as sea bream fillets, fresh-cut rocket salads 
and fresh whole strawberries showed that such device might be efficiently used 
in-storage for the extension of their shelf-life.•Easy-to-build and

With the growing technical ease and reduction in genetic screening costs, whole 
population BRCA screening may be a feasible option. Our objective was to 
investigate the cost effectiveness of whole population screening for BRCA 
mutations in Israel, for varying degrees of BRCA carrier state. Lifetime costs 
of whole female population screening for BRCA mutation carrier state versus 
nonscreening were compared using a Markovian process decision analysis model. 
Model parameters including ovarian and breast cancer risks were obtained from 
previously published data. Screening and other treatment-related costs were 
received from the Israeli Ministry of Health pricing list according to specified 
codes. Quality-adjusted life years were used for cost-effectiveness analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate model uncertainties, specifically 
varying degrees of BRCA prevalence. Results show that whole population BRCA 
screening in Israel is cost effective across a wide range of BRCA prevalence 
rates with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 81,493 new Israeli Shekels 
for a BRCA prevalence of 2.5%, increasing to 250,000 new Israeli Shekels for a 
0.75% prevalence rate, per quality-adjusted life year gained. Discount rate and 
population BRCA prevalence and rate of risk reduction salpingo-oophorectomy are 
the most influential parameters in the model. Whole population screening for 
BRCA mutations should be offered as part of general health screening strategies 
by national medical insurance providers, even for non-Ashkenazi Jews. Our 
algorithm can be applied for other countries, adjusting local costs of screening 
and treatment. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Whole population BRCA mutation screening in 
Israel is cost effective across a wide prevalence rate and should be offered as 
part of general health screening strategies by national medical insurance 
providers for cancer prevention.

INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy, share of the very old in populations 
and differences in the prevalence or types of health problems between male and 
female seniors pose challenges for health and social care systems in providing 
adequate care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to compare the health condition and quality 
of life between women and men aged 90 or over, as well as to correlate the 
quality of life at advanced age with demographic and health conditions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in Poland in 2015-2018 on 870 
women and 264 men aged 90 or over who were able to communicate logically and had 
no dementia diagnosed previously by a physician. The author's questionnaire, 
Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, Abbreviated Mental 
Test Score and WHO Quality of Life-Bref questionnaires were used.
RESULTS: The women aged 90 or over had a significantly higher prevalence of 
chronic pain (76% vs 60%), urinary incontinence (60% vs 44%), falls and syncopes 
(39% vs 25%), stool incontinence (17% vs 9%), more severe functional and 
cognitive impairment and lower quality of life than men at the same age. City 
residence, being widowed, chronic pain, geriatric giants and functional 
impairment were factors found to decrease all aspects of the life quality, while 
age in the studied interval decreased only physical health' assessment. Lack of 
education only affected negatively psychological health while cognitive 
impairment decreased the assessment of physical and psychological health, as 
well as social relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: Men who reached the age of 90 or over assessed their health 
condition and quality of life better than women at the same age.

In the last decades, a high increase in life expectancy not adequately balanced 
by an improvement in the quality of life has been observed, leading possibly to 
an increase in the prevalence of affective and cognitive disorders related to 
aging, such as depression, cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease. As mental illnesses have multifactorial aetiologies, many modifiable 
factors including lifestyle and nutrition play an essential role. Among 
nutritional factors, intermittent fasting has emerged as an innovative strategy 
to prevent and treat mental health disorders, sleep disturbances and cognitive 
impairment. Among all types of intermittent fasting regimens, the time 
restricted feeding appears to be the most promising protocol as it allows to 
induce benefits of a total fasting without reducing global calories and 
nutrients intake. This review summarises the evidence on the effect of time 
restricted feeding towards brain health, emphasising its role on brain 
signalling, neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

Rationale: Both 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are transmitted by respiratory secretions 
and in severe cases result in a viral pneumonitis, requiring intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission. However, no studies have compared the clinical characteristics 
and outcomes of such patients. Objectives: To report and compare the demographic 
characteristics, treatments, use of critical care resources, and outcomes of 
patients admitted to an Australian ICU with H1N1 influenza during the winter of 
2009, and SARS-CoV-2 during the winter of 2020. Methods: This was a multicenter 
project, using national data from previous and ongoing epidemiological studies 
concerning severe acute respiratory infections in Australia. All ICUs admitting 
patients with H1N1 or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were included and 
contributed data. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients 
with H1N1 admitted to ICU in the winter of 2009 versus patients with COVID-19 
admitted to ICU in the winter of 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality. Potential years of life lost (PYLL) were calculated according to 
sex-adjusted life expectancy in Australia. Results: Across the two epochs, 861 
patients were admitted to ICUs; 236 (27.4%) with COVID-19 and 625 (72.6%) with 
H1N1 influenza. The number of ICU admissions and bed-days occupied were higher 
with 2009 H1N1 influenza. Patients with COVID-19 were older, more often male and 
overweight, and had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 
scores at ICU admission. The highest age-specific incidence of ICU admission was 
among infants (0-1 yr of age) for H1N1, and among the elderly (≥65 yr) for 
COVID-19. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was similar (11.5% in COVID-19 vs. 
16.1% in H1N1; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.42-1.06]; 
P = 0.10). The PYLL was greater with H1N1 influenza than with COVID-19 at 154.1 
(95% CI, 148.7-159.4) versus 13.6 (95% CI, 12.2-15.1) PYLL per million 
inhabitants. Conclusions: In comparison with 2009 H1N1 influenza, COVID-19 
admissions overwinter in Australia resulted in fewer ICU admissions, and lower 
bed-day occupancy. Crude in-hospital mortality was similar, but because of 
demographic differences in affected patients, deaths due to 2009 H1N1 influenza 
led to an 11-fold increase in the number of PYLL in critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: The association of air pollution with multiple adverse health 
outcomes is becoming well established, but its negative economic impact is less 
well appreciated. It is important to elucidate this impact for the states of 
India.
METHODS: We estimated exposure to ambient particulate matter pollution, 
household air pollution, and ambient ozone pollution, and their attributable 
deaths and disability-adjusted life-years in every state of India as part of the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. We estimated the economic impact of 
air pollution as the cost of lost output due to premature deaths and morbidity 
attributable to air pollution for every state of India, using the 
cost-of-illness method.
FINDINGS: 1·67 million (95% uncertainty interval 1·42-1·92) deaths were 
attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, accounting for 17·8% (15·8-19·5) 
of the total deaths in the country. The majority of these deaths were from 
ambient particulate matter pollution (0·98 million [0·77-1·19]) and household
