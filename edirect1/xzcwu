this paper is to present recommendations on metabolic risk reduction in patients 
with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics, accepted as a position statement 
of the Polish Psychiatric Association for use in the management of persons 
suffering from schizophrenia in Poland. A routine assessment of metabolic risk 
is recommended for the early detection of metabolic disorders and to monitor the 
safety of the antipsychotic treatment. It includes: medical history, physical 
examination, laboratory tests. Each patient should undergo this assessment 
before the initiation of treatment, after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, and at 
least once a year thereafter. In men and women suffering from schizophrenia who 
are over the age of 40 and 50 years, respectively, a cardiovascular risk 
assessment using the SCORE charts is also recommended. (1) Antipsychotics with a 
low potential to cause metabolic disorders should be preferred and administered 
at the appropriate dose in order to reduce metabolic risk. (2) If other agents 
found to cause metabolic disorders are used, the treatment should be modified by 
augmentation or by switching to another antipsychotic with a lower potential to 
cause metabolic disorders. (3) Consultation by an internal medicine specialist 
and medical treatment should be recommended. (4) Patients should be assisted in 
developing healthy eating habits, encouraged to pursue regular physical activity 
and (5) to quit smoking, drinking alcohol and using psychoactive substances.

Ensuring the microbiological safety of food products is a problem of current 
interest. The use of antimicrobial packaging materials is a way of solving the 
problem. When developing packaging materials, it is advisable to use a modern 
approach based on the creation of biodegradable materials. The difficulty in the 
selection of the polymer compositions' components lies in solving the dilemma of 
the joint introduction and processing of antimicrobial and biodegradable agents. 
The studies of the ultrasound treatment on the melts of polymer mixtures showed 
an increase in the dispersion process of the components of the mixture. In this 
regard, this work aimed to study the effect of the ultrasonic treatment on the 
melts of polymer compositions containing thermoplastic starch and birch bark 
extract (BBE). In the work, the properties of PE-based packaging materials with 
various BBE concentrations obtained with ultrasonic treatment of melts on a 
laboratory extruder were studied. Biodegradable polymer compositions containing 
thermoplastic starch and BBE, obtained with the use of the ultrasonic treatment 
during extrusion, were investigated. The methods for studying rheological, 
physic-mechanical, antimicrobial properties and sanitary chemical indicators of 
materials were used in the article. It was found that ultrasonic treatment 
increases the melt flow and contributes to the production of materials with the 
uniform distribution of additives. The BBE content from 1.0% and higher in the 
contents of the material provides antimicrobial properties. When studying the 
permeability of oxygen and water vapor of the polymer compositions based on PE 
and BBE, it was found that the introduction of a filler increases vapor 
permeability by about 8-12% compared with control samples. The optimal 
concentration of BBE in polyethylene compositions containing thermoplastic 
starch was determined. The extension of the shelf life of the food product 
during storage in the developed material was established.

OBJECTIVES: Too little is known about hearing loss rehabilitation in patients 
with Alström syndrome (AS). Benefits of hearing aids (HA) have not been fully 
documented and only one case treated with a Cochlear Implant (CI) has been 
described in the proceedings of a conference. Furthermore, comorbidities and 
risk of complications following surgical intervention may contraindicate 
Cochlear Implant procedures in these patients.The present case report concerns 
the first AS patient with CI in the literature.
METHODS: After reporting a concise description of the audiological profile of 
patients with AS described in the literature, the case of a 22-year-old woman 
with genetically confirmed Alström syndrome who underwent a sequential bilateral 
CI (Bi-CI) rehabilitation is reported. Audiological results before and after 
cochlear implantation are described.
RESULTS: The patient showed an excellent functional outcome with CIs, which 
enabled her to achieve communicative, social and academic results comparable 
with her peers, and no complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: AS is not necessarily an absolute contraindication to CI. For many 
AS patients, a good cognitive function and adequate life expectancy represent a 
clear indication to prompt and adequate hearing rehabilitation with CIs. The 
description of this type of clinical cases could in the future also generate 
indications for a tailored audiological treatment of patients with very specific 
needs, such as patients with Alström Syndrome.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of 
first-line dialysis modalities for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients under 
the "Peritoneal Dialysis First" policy.
METHODS: Lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses from both healthcare provider and 
societal perspectives were performed using Markov modelling by simulating at age 
60. Empirical data on costs and health utility scores collected from our studies 
were combined with published data on health state transitions and survival data 
to estimate the lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
cost-effectiveness of three competing dialysis modalities: peritoneal dialysis 
(PD), hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) and nocturnal home HD.
RESULTS: For cost-effectiveness analysis over a lifetime horizon from the 
perspective of healthcare provider, hospital-based HD group (lifetime cost 
USD$142,389; 6.58 QALYs) was dominated by the PD group (USD$76,915; 7.13 QALYs). 
Home-based HD had the highest effectiveness (8.37 QALYs) but with higher cost 
(USD$97,917) than the PD group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
was USD$16,934 per QALY gained for home-based HD over PD. From the societal 
perspective, the results were similar and the ICER was USD$1195 per QALY gained 
for home-based HD over PD. Both ICERs fell within the acceptable thresholds. 
Changes in model parameters via sensitivity analyses had a minimal impact on 
ICER values.
CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of dialysis modalities 
and service delivery models for ESRD patients under "Peritoneal Dialysis First" 
policy. For both healthcare provider and societal perspectives, PD as first-line 
dialysis modality was cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD, supporting the 
existing PD First or favoured policy. When compared with PD, Nocturnal home 
Home-based HD was considered a cost-effective first-line dialysis modality for 
ESRD patients.

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 5 versus 10 years of 
alendronate treatment prior to 5-year drug holiday for US postmenopausal women 
with hip BMD T-scores between - 2.5 and - 3.5. We found that for most 
postmenopausal women 5 years of treatment prior to drug holiday is the more 
effective and cost-effective option.
INTRODUCTION: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare 5 versus 
10 years of alendronate treatment prior to 5-year drug holiday for 
postmenopausal osteoporotic women.
METHODS: We created an individual-level state-transition microsimulation model 
to compare 3 treatment strategies for US postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 
and femoral neck BMD T-scores between - 2.5 and - 3.5 at baseline: recurrent 
periods of 5 years of alendronate followed by 5 years of drug holiday 
(alendronate 5/5), recurrent periods of 10 years of alendronate followed by 
5 years of drug holiday (alendronate 10/5), and no alendronate treatment.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis revealed for women initiating treatment at ages 50, 
60, and 70, the alendronate 5/5 strategy dominated (was more effective and less 
costly than) the alendronate 10/5 strategy and no treatment. For women age 80, 
the alendronate 10/5 strategy dominated. When assuming a lower relative risk of 
nonvertebral fracture during years 6-10 of alendronate treatment than the 
base-case assumption, the alendronate 10/5 strategy became the most 
cost-effective strategy even at younger treatment initiation ages. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings; for treatment 
initiation ages of 50, 60, and 70, the alendronate 5/5 strategy was favored, 
whereas for treatment initiation age of 80, the alendronate 10/5 strategy was 
favored; however, there was uncertainty in these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: After 5 years of alendronate treatment, younger postmenopausal 
women (ages 50-70) with osteoporosis would likely benefit from a drug holiday, 
whereas older women (age 80) are likely to benefit from treatment for 10 years 
before a drug holiday.

More and more people with disabilities are reaching an advanced age. At the same 
time the life expectancy of the population as a whole is increasing, which is 
accompanied by an increase in physical, mental and cognitive impairments. This 
results in specific social inequalities and forms of discrimination, which, 
however, have so far not played a special role in the intersectionality debates. 
While the intersections of disability and gender and also of age and gender are 
being studied, there have been hardly any studies on the intersection of age 
(and especially higher age) and disability so far. It is also promising in terms 
of theory formation to combine both categories, which could be helpful for 
empirical research and the routine practice. In intersectionality research the 
question is discussed which categories can be regarded as central in order to 
critically analyze power structures and forms of discrimination. This article 
discusses to what extent both age and disability should be considered relevant 
categories in intersectional theory and research. To this end, the role of the 
body and the concept of normality with respect to both categories and their 
intersection are discussed.

Should Health Economic Evaluations Undertaken from a Societal Perspective 
Include Net Government Spending Multiplier Effects?

The fiscal multiplier represents the ratio of the change in national income to 
an associated increase in government spending. Fiscal multiplier effects are 
commonly estimated to justify options for government spending. Multiplier 
effects are not considered in economic evaluations of healthcare, but alternate 
forms of healthcare spending are expected to have varying multiplier effects. 
This paper describes the estimation and application of net government spending 
multiplier effects to two published economic evaluations. Negative net 
multiplier effects are estimated for an evaluated pharmaceutical for the 
treatment of stable cardiovascular disease, with a resulting increase in the 
published incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from 
AU$31,244 to 47,311. Positive net multiplier effects are estimated for an 
evaluated healthcare delivery model for frail older people, with a resulting 
decrease in the published incremental cost per QALY gained from AU$8129 to 7669. 
The inclusion of net multiplier effects in economic evaluations undertaken from 
a societal perspective can have important effects on the estimated value of 
evaluated health technologies and services. The potential for government 
spending on healthcare to crowd out existing spending is considered low, but 
further investigation of crowding-out effects is warranted.

Given the critical role that the immune system plays in a multitude of diseases, 
having a clear understanding of the pharmacology of the immune system is crucial 
to new drug discovery and development. Here we describe the International Union 
of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) Guide to Immunopharmacology 
(GtoImmuPdb), which connects expert-curated pharmacology with key immunological 
concepts and aims to put pharmacological data into the hands of immunologists. 
In the pursuit of new therapeutics, pharmacological databases are a vital 
resource to researchers through providing accurate information on the 
fundamental science underlying drug action. This extension to the existing 
IUPHAR/British Pharmacological Society Guide to Pharmacology supports research 
into the development of drugs targeted at modulating immune, inflammatory or 
infectious components of disease. To provide a deeper context for how the 
resource can support research we show data in GtoImmuPdb relating to a case 
study on the targeting of vascular inflammation.

Conditions and comorbidities of obesity mirror those of ageing and age-related 
diseases. Obesity and ageing share a similar spectrum of phenotypes such as 
compromised genomic integrity, impaired mitochondrial function, accumulation of 
intracellular macromolecules, weakened immunity, shifts in tissue and body 
composition, and enhanced systemic inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown 
that obesity reduces life expectancy by 5.8 years in men and 7.1 years in women 
after the age of 40. Shorter life expectancy could be because obesity 
holistically accelerates ageing at multiple levels. Besides jeopardizing nuclear 
DNA and mitochondrial DNA integrity, obesity modifies the DNA methylation 
pattern, which is associated with epigenetic ageing in different tissues. 
Additionally, other signs of ageing are seen in individuals with obesity 
including telomere shortening, systemic inflammation, and functional declines. 
This review aims to show how obesity and ageing are "two sides of the same coin" 
through discussing how obesity predisposes an individual to age-related 
conditions, illness, and disease. We will further demonstrate how the mechanisms 
that perpetuate the early-onset of chronic diseases in obesity parallel those of 
ageing.

BACKGROUND: Various authors have shown that Cruciate Retaining (CR) Total Knee 
Arthroplasty (TKA) has better long-term survivorship compared to Posterior 
Stabilized (PS), however most arthroplasty surgeons tend to use PS knees in 
patients with severe deformity and stiffness. There is limited data correlating 
stiffness and CR versus PS design. The aim of our study was to assess the 
outcome of CR TKA for patients with stiff arthritic knee.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We evaluated the results of 30 knees with osteoarthritis 
and inflammatory arthritis and preoperative stiffness (ROM 15-90°), who had been 
treated with CR TKA with a mean follow up of 2 years. The primary outcome 
variable measures were improvement in the flexion, flexion deformity (FFD) and 
overall improvement in the arc of motion. Patients were also evaluated by Knee 
Society Score (KSS), WOMAC score and 5-point Likert scale for patient 
satisfaction.
RESULT: At the time of final follow-up, the mean arc of motion improved from 75° 
preoperatively to 108° postoperatively and it was statistically significant 
(p < 0.001). Similar improvement was noted for FFD (15.43° to 0.83° 
(p < 0.001)), maximum flexion from 90.9° to 109.1° (p < 0.001), KSS clinical 
from 37.67 to 87.47 (p < 0.001), KSS functional from 58.5 to 93.83 (p < 0.001), 
WOMAC from 76.73 to 7.63 (p < 0.001). Further, the Likert Scale for patient 
satisfaction was excellent for 90% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: This study clearly shows that the routine use of PS design for 
complex stiff knees has questionable scientific intent and standard CR TKA 
design in stiff knees can produce excellent outcome. Since there is slight 
preponderance of data pointing towards improved longevity with CR design, it 
would be a better option for the patients with longer life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: For patients with inadequate control of cholesterol using 
moderate-dose statins in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD), either doubling the dose of statins or adding ezetimibe should be 
considered. The cost-effectiveness of them is unknown in the Chinese context. 
The aim of this study is to compare the cost and effectiveness of the two 
regimens, and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
METHODS: A Markov model of five health statuses were used to estimate long-term 
costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the two treatment regimens from 
the healthcare perspective. The effectiveness data used to calculate the 
transition probability was based on a previously published randomized trial. The 
utility data was gathered from literature and the costs were gathered from the 
electronic medical record system of West China Hospital in Chinese Yuan (CNY) in 
2017 price. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
were conducted.
RESULTS: The ICER for ezetimibe plus moderate-dose rosuvastatin was 47,102.99 
CNY per QALY for 20 years simulation, which did not reach the threshold of per 
capita gross domestic product (GDP) of 59,660 CNY per QALY in 2017 in China. 
Non-CVD-related mortality and CVD-related mortality contributed most to the 
ICER.
CONCLUSION: Adding ezetimibe to the moderate-dose statin in secondary prevention 
for CVD is cost-effective, compared with the high-dose statin in the Chinese 
context whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) was not inadequately 
controlled by moderate-dose statin alone.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in life expectancy seen throughout the world, the 
prevalence of degenerative spinal pathology and surgery to treat it has 
increased. Spinal surgery under general anesthesia leads to various problems and 
complications, especially in patients with numerous medical comorbidities or 
elderly patients. For this reason, there is a need for safer anesthetic methods 
applicable to unhealthy, elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery.
PURPOSE: To report our experience with utilizing fluoroscopy-guided epidural 
anesthesia in conjunction with conscious sedation in spinal surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 111 patients at our 
institution that received fluoroscopy-guided epidural anesthesia for lumbar 
surgery from February to September 2018. Patients' records were evaluated to 
evaluate patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiology Physical 
Classification System (ASA) class, and pain numerical rating scores (NRS) 
preoperatively and throughout their recovery postoperatively. Intraoperative 
data including volume of epidural anesthetic used, extent of epidural spread, 
and inadvertent subdural injection was collected. Postoperative recovery time 
was also collected.
RESULTS: The mean age of our patients was 60 years old with a range between 31 
and 83 years old. All patients experienced decreases in postoperative pain with 
no significant differences based on age or ASA class. There was no association 
between ASA class and time to recovery postoperatively. Older patients (age 70 
years or greater) had a significantly longer recovery time when compared to 
younger patients. Recovery also was longer for patients who received higher 
volumes of epidural anesthesia. For every 1 mL increase of epidural anesthetic 
given, there was an increase in the extent of spread of 1.8 spinal levels.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the safety and feasibility of utilizing conscious 
sedation in conjunction with fluoroscopy-guided epidural anesthesia in the 
lumbar spinal surgery.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is essential in health decision making. Several 
countries use it as synthesis of evidence to incorporate health technologies. 
The protease inhibitors (PI) boceprevir (BOC) and telaprevir (TVR) are indicated 
for chronic hepatitis C treatment and were incorporated in guidelines worldwide. 
Pre-marketing clinical trials showed higher sustained virological response rates 
in relation to previous therapies, but the incorporation of PIs generated a 
significant financial impact. The aim of this study was to discuss the relevance 
of cost-effectiveness analysis through a study that involved the inclusion of 
PIs in a clinical protocol. The analysis was part of a real-life study that 
included patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 treated in a 
tertiary university hospital in Brazil. Triple therapies (TT) with ribavirin 
(RBV), peginterferon α-2a (Peg-INF α-2a) and BOC or TVR were compared to dual 
therapy with RBV and Peg-INF α-2a. Sensitivity analysis of the 
cost-effectiveness ratio indicated an 88.2% chance of TTs presenting a higher 
cost per cure. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) exceeded the 
Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) per capita by three times in all proposed 
scenarios. The sensitivity of ICER showed an 88.4% chance of TT not being 
cost-effective. The impact of PI incorporation was negative and the conduct 
about this could have been different if a previous cost-effectiveness analysis 
had been conducted.

This last century, the development of new medicinal molecules represents a real 
breakthrough in terms of humans and animal life expectancy and quality of life. 
However, this success is tainted by negative environmental consequences. Indeed, 
the synthesis of drug candidates requires the use of many chemicals, solvents, 
and processes that are very hazardous, toxic, energy consuming, expensive, and 
generates a large amount of waste. Many large pharmaceutical companies have thus 
moved to using green chemistry practices for drug discovery, development, and 
manufacturing. One of them is the use of energy-efficient activation techniques, 
such as ultrasound. This review summarizes the latest most representative works 
published on the use of ultrasound for sustainable bioactive molecules 
synthesis.

Life expectancy (LE) is a comprehensive and important index for measuring 
population health. Research on LE and its influencing factors is helpful for 
health improvement. Previous studies have neither considered the spatial 
stratified heterogeneity of LE nor explored the interactions between its 
influencing factors. Our study was based on the latest available LE and social 
and environmental factors data of 31 provinces in 2010 in China. Descriptive and 
spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed to explore the spatial 
characteristics of LE. Furthermore, the Geographical Detector (GeoDetector) 
technique was used to reveal the impact of social and environmental factors and 
their interactions on LE as well as their optimal range for the maximum LE 
level. The results show that there existed obvious spatial stratified 
heterogeneity of LE, and LE mainly presented two clustering types (high-high and 
low-low) with positive autocorrelation. The results of GeoDetector showed that 
the number of college students per 100,000 persons (NOCS) could mainly explained 
the spatial stratified heterogeneity of LE (Power of Determinant (PD) = 0.89, p 
< 0.001). With the discretization of social and environmental factors, we found 
that LE reached the highest level with birth rate, total dependency ratio, 
number of residents per household and water resource per capita at their minimum 
range; conversely, LE reached the highest level with consumption level, GDP per 
capita, number of college students per 100,000 persons, medical care expenditure 
and urbanization rate at their maximum range. In addition, the interaction of 
any two factors on LE was stronger than the effect of a single factor. Our study 
suggests that there existed obvious spatial stratified heterogeneity of LE in 
China, which could mainly be explained by NOCS.

Review: Overview of factors affecting productive lifespan of dairy cows.

The average productive lifespan is approximately 3 to 4 years in countries with 
high-producing dairy cows. This is much shorter than the natural life expectancy 
of dairy cattle. Dairy farmers continue to cull cows primarily for reasons 
related to poor health, failure to conceive or conformation problems prior to 
culling. These reasons may indicate reduced welfare leading up to culling. 
Improvements in health care, housing and nutrition will reduce forced culling 
related to these welfare reasons. However, productive lifespan has remained 
similar in decades, despite large improvements in cow comfort and genetic 
selection for the ability to avoid culling. On the other hand, genetic progress 
for economically important traits is accelerating within the last decade, which 
should slightly shorten the average economically optimal productive lifespan. A 
major driver of productive lifespan is the availability of replacement heifers 
that force cows out when they calve. The average productive lifespan could be 
extended by reducing the supply of dairy heifers, which would also have benefits 
for environmental sustainability. Improvements in culling decision support tools 
would strengthen economically optimal replacement decisions. In conclusion, 
major factors of the relatively short productive lifespan of dairy cows are 
welfare-related, but other economic factors like supply of heifers, genetic 
progress and non-optimal decision-making also play important roles.

Integrating Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Into HIV Care Systems in 
Indonesia: A Synthesis of Recent Evidence.

Lindayani L, Darmawati I, Purnama H, Permana B.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the health and life 
expectancy of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Comorbidities and geriatric syndrome are more prevalent in patients with HIV 
than in the general population. As a result, people living with HIV may face 
unique characteristics and needs related to aging. Health-care systems need to 
prepare to encounter those issues that not only focus on virology suppression 
and cART management but also chronic non-AIDS comorbidities and geriatric 
syndrome. However, there are limited data on geriatric assessment among people 
living with HIV. The purpose of this article is to present findings of a 
literature search that integrate age-related issues in HIV care management for 
health-care professionals caring for people living with HIV in Indonesia to 
consider. Integrating comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) into HIV care is 
essential. However, some critical issues need to be considered prior to 
implementing CGA in HIV primary care, including social vulnerability, economic 
inequality, and aging-related stigma. Developing guidelines for implementing CGA 
in HIV primary clinics remains a priority. Studies of HIV in the aging 
population in Indonesia need to be conducted to understand the burden of 
geriatric syndrome.

Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an important emergency that should be 
identified promptly. The classification of AAD follows two different systems: 
Stanford (which defines lesions as types A, on the ascending aorta, or B, on the 
descending aorta) and DeBakey, which also accounts for the extension of the 
aortic dissection. We present a notable case of a 63-year-old male who presented 
with a history of abrupt abdominal pain radiating to the dorsal region for 
endovascular treatment. He was oliguric with symmetric pulses in the superior 
limbs and reduction of pulses in the left lower limbs, with signs of 
hypoperfusion. Angiotomography evidenced acute abdominal thoracic aortic 
dissection classified as DeBakey III and Stanford B, extending through the left 
iliac artery. He was submitted to endovascular correction of the abdominal 
thoracic aortic dissection, with implantation of two straight Valiant type 
endoprosthesis (26x200 mm and 38x200 mm), positioned after the emergence of the 
left subclavian artery and right above the celiac trunk, respectively. There was 
also implantation of the stent graft Viabahn (5x60 mm) and Assurant stent (7x30 
mm) in the left renal artery. After the urgent surgical intervention, the 
patient has recovered well. He has been checked in outpatient follow-ups for the 
past three years with preserved renal function (1.5 mg/dl creatinine) and 
correct positioning of the endoprosthesis (confirmed by CT without contrast). 
Hypertension and a smoking history are the most important risk factors 
associated with aortic dissections, and should be considered when evaluating a 
patient with chest or back pain (typically described as sharp rather than 
tearing or ripping) in the emergency department. The endovascular approach to 
descending dissections was introduced in 1999 and has been established as the 
standard approach to descending dissections of the aorta, because of the excess 
mortality of the open approach (32% in open surgery and 7% for those managed 
with endovascular techniques) and low rate of complications. Ten-year survival 
rates for patients with AAD ranging from 30% to 60% justifies an aggressive 
follow-up strategy of discharge, with the goal of minimizing aortic wall stress 
through drugs (such as β blockers) and surveillance to detect progression. Our 
report shows that an early detection of symptoms coupled with an aggressive and 
precise endovascular intervention has produced satisfactory clinical, 
laboratorial and quality-of-life outcomes in an older patient with an extensive 
type B arterial dissection.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem accompanied by 
substantial comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. In this respect, 
progressive CKD leading to uraemia can be seen as a systemic disease with a 
critical impact on virtually all organ systems. Therefore, it is of particular 
importance to identify patients with ongoing CKD progression, which is 
challenging, because the individual course of CKD is difficult to predict. 
Patterns of progression in CKD patients include linear and non-linear 
trajectories of GFR loss, but kidney function can also remain stable for years. 
Moreover, a substantial GFR decline may occur in the absence of higher-grade 
albuminuria (non-proteinuric CKD), rendering the measurement of albuminuria less 
reliable for progression prediction in such individuals. In the present review, 
we focus on the recently identified glycoprotein Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) as a 
stress-induced, renal tubular epithelial cell-derived, pro-fibrotic molecule. In 
experimental CKD models, DKK3 promoted renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis through 
modulation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. In clinical 
studies, increased urinary DKK3 levels identified patients at high risk for 
short-term CKD progression, regardless of the cause of kidney disease, baseline 
kidney function and albuminuria. Moreover, increased urinary DKK3 levels are 
associated with a high risk for acute kidney injury and the subsequent loss of 
kidney function after cardiac surgery. These findings highlight DKK3 as a 
mediator of renal tubular cell damage in kidney injury and short-term 
progression of kidney disease, with potential therapeutic implications.

Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases are neurodegenerative aging-related 
pathological conditions, mainly caused by the interplay of genetic and 
non-genetic factors and whose incidence rate is going to drastically increase 
given the growing life expectancy. To address these complex multifactorial 
traits, a systems biology strategy is needed to highlight genotype-phenotype 
correlations as well as overlapping gene signatures. Copy number variants (CNVs) 
are structural chromosomal imbalances that can have pathogenic nature causing or 
contributing to the disease onset or progression. Moreover, neurons affected by 
CNVs have been found to decline in number depending on age in healthy controls 
and may be selectively vulnerable to aging-related cell-death. In this review, 
we aim to update the reader on the role of these variations in the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. To widen the comprehension of pathogenic 
mechanisms underlying them, we discuss variations detected from blood or brain 
specimens, as well as overlapped signatures between the two pathologies.

AIM: There is no study in the literature that evaluates the cost-effectiveness 
of robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) over laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy 
(LDP). We performed a comparative study of RDP and LDP with the aim of 
evaluating clinical and cost-effective outcomes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, comparative prospective 
nonrandomized study. The primary end point was to compare the cost-effectiveness 
differences between both groups. A willingness to pay of €20 000 and €30 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as a threshold to recognize which 
treatment was most cost-effective.
RESULTS: A total of 31 RDP and 28 LDP have been included. The overall mean total 
cost was similar in both groups (RDP: €9712.15 versus LDP: €9424.68; P > .5). 
Mean QALYs for RDP (0.652) was higher than that associated with LDP (0.59) (P 
> .5).
CONCLUSION: This study seems to provide data of cost-effectiveness between RDP 
and LDP approaches, showing some benefits for RDP.

AIM: To determine the contribution of smoking-related deaths to the life 
expectancy gap in both Māori and Pacific people compared with 
non-Māori/non-Pacific people in New Zealand.
METHODS: Death registration and population data between 2013 and 2015 were used 
to calculate life expectancy. To determine the contribution of smoking to the 
life expectancy gap, population attributable fractions for all causes of death 
where smoking is a casual risk factor were calculated using age- and 
ethnic-specific smoking data from the 2013 New Zealand Census and relative risk 
estimates from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II. 
Population attributable fractions were applied to all deaths registered in New 
Zealand for the 2013-15 period to estimate the number of deaths attributable to 
tobacco smoking. The life expectancy gap was decomposed using the Arriaga 
method. The gap was decomposed both overall and by specific smoking attributable 
causes of death.
RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015 an estimated 12,421 (13.4% of all deaths) were 
attributable to smoking. Nearly one in four (22.6%) deaths among Māori were 
attributable to smoking (2,199 out of 9,717 deaths) and nearly one in seven 
(13.8%) among Pacific people (512 out of 3,720 deaths). Among 
non-Māori/non-Pacific people, one in eight (12.3%) deaths were attributable to 
smoking (9,710 out of 78,759 deaths). Higher rates of smoking attributable 
mortality were responsible for 2.1 years of the life expectancy gap in Māori 
men, 2.3 years in Māori women, 1.4 years in Pacific men and 0.3 years among 
Pacific women. Cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease were the leading smoking 
attributable causes of death contributing to the gap.
CONCLUSION: Smoking is an important preventable risk factor contributing to 
ethnic inequities in life expectancy for Māori men and women, and Pacific men. 
Dramatic declines in smoking-attributable deaths can be achieved by reducing 
smoking prevalence rates. Preventing smoking initiation and increasing cessation 
rates must remain a top priority for the Ministry of Health and District Health 
Boards. Smokefree initiatives should be reoriented to be Tiriti o Waitangi 
(Treaty of Waitangi) compliant and better meet the needs of Māori and Pacific 
people who smoke. Addressing the residual risk in ex-smokers through equitable 
early diagnosis and treatment of smoking-related conditions will further assist 
a more rapid closing of life expectancy gaps for Māori men and women and Pacific 
men. The next five years provide the opportunity to demonstrate commitment to 
achieving a smokefree Aotearoa for all: an aspiration, based on the current 
trajectory, which is most probably out of reach.
