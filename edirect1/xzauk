EDSS scores 0.0-3.5 and 4.0-6.0 than for scores > 6.0 (P < 0.05). The 
extrapolated data gave an estimated annual direct cost of MS per patient of 
<euro>18,030. In conclusion, relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS 
phenotypes and lower estimated EDSS scores appear to be associated with higher 
costs.

College, Peshawar, Pakistan. zakirent@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) is a form of fungal disease that has 
recently been considered a distinct clinicopathologic entity. Other forms of 
fungal sinusitis include acute-fulminant (invasive), chronic indolent (invasive) 
and mycetoma (non-invasive). Objectives were to assess the presentation and to 
describe the diagnostic techniques for allergic fungal sinusitis in our setup.
METHOD: Descriptive study was conducted in the Department of ENT and Head & Neck 
Surgery, Khyber Medical College and Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar from 
January 2002 to April 2008. Twenty-three cases of allergic fungal sinusitis 
(ASF) were selected for the study. Data like, name, age, sex, address, clinical 
features, labs (Eosinophil count) and imaging studies (CT and/or MRI) were 
recorded, including the pre- and postoperative treatment, operative findings and 
postoperative results, recurrence of disease were also recorded. Surgical 
procedures were performed on all cases followed by medical treatment.
RESULTS: Study revealed that AFS is a disease of younger age, mainly occurring 
in 2nd & 3rd decade of life, with male to female ratio 1:1.3. Allergic rhinitis 
(91%) and nasal polyposis (91%) were important associated factors. Nasal 
obstruction (96%), nasal discharge (91%), post-nasal discharge (87%) and 
unilateral multi sinus extension were important clinical features. Increased 
eosinophil count and increased IgE level was found in 78% cases. 
Histopathological analysis showed fungal hyphae in all cases and aspergillus was 
predominant organism on culture. Orbital erosion was seen in 78% and skull base 
erosion was observed in 9%. Recurrence of disease was seen in nine cases.
CONCLUSION: Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) is a disease of young 
immunocompetent adults. Nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, nasal allergy and 
proptosis were the most common presentations. Initial diagnosis of allergic 
fungal sinusitis requires high index of suspicion in patients presenting with 
chronic rhinosinusitis, such cases should be properly evaluated. Differentiation 
from invasive forms of fungal sinus disease is crucial.

BACKGROUND: It has been shown that possible influence of body weight is more 
evident for coronary than aortic atherosclerosis; and more in men than women. 
Coronary heart disease due to obesity in males becomes significant when body 
mass index (BMI) exceeds 30 (30% overweight) and does not affect the life 
expectancy particularly in women. This study was conducted to asses the relation 
of thickness of fat penniculus (obesity) between xiphoid and umbilicus to 
different atherosclerotic lesions; and to collect basic data about age and sex 
distribution of this relation
METHODS: It was prospective descriptive study and conducted at mortuary of King 
Edward Medical University, and Department of Pathology, Allama Iqbal Medical 
College. Lahore. A total of 130 human autopsies were carried out in 
one-and-a-half year of study duration. The ages of the deceased ranged between 8 
and 85 years. Heart aorta and its major branches were included in this study. In 
addition, fat penniculus between xiphoid and umbilicus was measured and 
atherosclerosis lesions were categorised and correlated with this parameter. 
Haematoxylin and Eosin, and different special stains were done in Pathology 
Department of Allama Lqbal Medical College, Lahore to asses to severity of 
atherosclerosis lesions.
RESULTS: The fatty streaks were present in predominantly more cases with Fat 
Penniculus < 20 mm than in asses with Fat Penniculus < 10 mm and < 30 mm. The 
fibrolipid plaques, complicated and calcified lesions were present in a dominant 
number of cases with Fat Penniculus < 30 mm on percentage basis.
CONCLUSION: Raised lesions were seen more frequently in cases with Fat 
Penniculus 20 mm to < 30 mm than in cases with Fat Penniculus < 10 mm and < 20 
mm thickness.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The japanese population have the longest-life expectancy in the 
world. Accordingly, older patients with colorectal cancer with senile kyphosis 
caused by aging or osteoporosis also increase. Laparoscopic surgery is 
minimally-invasive, and performance on severe kyphotic patients may cause 
difficulty to approach a narrow abdomen. To determine whether laparoscopic 
surgery is safe and feasible in patients with severe senile kyphosis.
METHODS: Laparoscopic operations under general anesthesia were undertaken with 
the patients in lithotomy position. Intraoperative difficulties were compared 
with normal laparoscopic approach.
RESULTS: Working space was divided by right costal arch during right 
hemicolectomy for right sided colon cancer. For sigmoid colon cancer, dissection 
of lymph node and anastomosis were completed with much difficulty because the 
pelvic space was occupied with small intestine. However, the postoperative 
course was uneventful despite impaired lung function in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe senile kyphosis is not a contraindication for minimally 
invasive technique applied to colorectal cancer patients.

Comment in
    Pain Pract. 2011 Nov-Dec;11(6):582.

Angina pectoris, cardiac pain associated with ischemia, is considered refractory 
when optimal anti-anginal therapy fails to resolve symptoms. It is associated 
with a decreased life expectancy and diminishes the quality of life. Spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS) may be considered for patients who have also undergone 
comprehensive interventions, such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. The mechanism 
of action of SCS is not entirely clear. Pain reduction is related to the 
increased release of inhibitory neuropeptides as well as normalization of the 
intrinsic nerve system of the heart muscle, and may have a protective myocardial 
effect. SCS in patients with refractory angina pectoris results in reduced 
anginal attacks as well as improved rate pressure product prior to the 
occurrence of ischemic events. This may be the result of reduced Myocardial 
Volume Oxygen (MVO(2) ) and possibly the redistribution of the coronary blood 
flow to ischemic areas. There are a number of studies that demonstrate that SCS 
does not mask acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of the treatment has 
been investigated in two prospective, randomized studies. The long-term results 
showed an improvement of the symptoms and of the quality of life. SCS can be an 
alternative to surgical intervention in a selected patient population. In 
addition, SCS is a viable option in patients in whom surgery is not possible. 
SCS is recommended in patients with chronic refractory angina pectoris that does 
not respond to conventional treatment and in whom revascularization procedures 
have been attempted or not possible, and who are optimized from a medical 
perspective.

Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

AIM: To evaluate survival, clinical, and genetic characteristics of all patients 
with classic or type 1 lissencephaly born between 1972 and 1990 in the 
Netherlands, who at the time were enrolled in an observational study.
METHOD: We re-evaluated 24 patients (11 males, 13 females) for long-term 
follow-up and survival information.
RESULTS: Mean length of follow-up was 14 years (SD 9 y 8 mo). Eleven patients 
were alive at follow-up. All patients showed severe intellectual disability, 
intractable epilepsy, and complete dependency on care. Life expectancy was 
related to the severity of the lissencephaly on neuroimaging. Molecular analysis 
of the LIS1 gene was not possible at the time of the original study and was now 
requested by eight parents. This revealed a pathogenic nonsense mutation or 
deletion in seven patients.
INTERPRETATION: Our study provides information about the long-term course of 
lissencephaly and the relationship between lissencephaly severity and prognosis. 
It also shows that renewed attention to genetic counselling remains valued by 
families of patients with a severe congenital neurological disease.

Philadelphia, USA. jennifer.goldsack@uphs.upenn.edu

This study examines the distribution of health outcomes research (HOR) studies 
in the clinical literature by clinical areas and journal impact factor. The 
authors reviewed 535 journals and divided the sample into higher and lower 
impact journals across four clinical area. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests 
were used to examine differences across four categories of outcomes research 
articles published, specifically the incidence of articles in higher versus 
lower impact journals and differences across clinical areas. All high-impact 
journals published more safety and quality articles than process assessment, 
quality of life, or cost analysis studies. The number of each type of outcomes 
research study published was highly variable across all clinical areas. Only 
arthritis and outcomes research journals showed statistically significant 
differences between higher versus lower impact journals. Authors may benefit 
from considering these differences in their clinical specialty area when 
deciding where to submit HOR studies.

OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic and socioeconomic differentials associated 
with the health status of oldest-old individuals living in two cities of 
different Brazilian regions.
METHODS: A comparative and cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted 
with the oldest-old (> 80 years), living in the cities of Ribeirão Preto (RP, 
Southeastern Brazil) and Caxias do Sul (CS, Southern). The probabilistic sample 
included 117 individuals in CS and 155 in RP, and data were collected between 
2007 and 2008. The instrument included demographic and socioeconomic data, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Independence Measure, number of 
self-reported comorbidities and Geriatric Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Mean age was similar, with predominance of women (~70%) and widowed 
individuals (~60%) in both cities. Mean level of education did no differ 
statistically, although mean income was higher in RP than in CS (p = 0.05). RP 
showed a higher concentration of individuals in the extreme levels of education 
and income than that of CS. Mean score of the Mini-Mental State Examination was 
similar in both groups and higher among men, individuals aged between 80 and 84 
years, married and with a higher level of education. Better functional 
performance was observed in elderly individuals aged between 80 and 84 years in 
both cities, in those with higher level of education in RP; and in males and 
married individuals in CS. Elderly individuals in CS showed higher number of 
comorbidities than those in RP (p < 0.001). Male elderly individuals, married 
and with -higher income level showed fewer depressive symptoms in both groups; 
and those in RP showed higher Geriatric Depression Scale score than the others 
in CS (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the oldest old in CS showed lower socioeconomic inequality 
and fewer depressive symptoms, they also had a higher mean number of 
comorbidities and lower level of functional independence, when compared to those 
in RP.

Cost-effectiveness of lower extremity compression ultrasound in emergency 
department patients with a high risk of hemodynamically stable pulmonary 
embolism.

USA. mward04@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Computed tomography angiograms (CTAs) for patients with suspected 
pulmonary embolism (PE) are being ordered with increasing frequency from the 
emergency department (ED). Strategies are needed to safely decrease the 
utilization of CTs to control rising health care costs and minimize the 
associated risks of anaphylaxis, contrast-induced nephropathy, and 
radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The use of compression ultrasonography (US) to 
identify deep vein thromboses (DVTs) in hemodynamically stable patients with 
signs and symptoms suggestive of PE is highly specific for the diagnosis of PE 
and may represent a cost-effective alternative to CT imaging.
OBJECTIVES:   The objective was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of a selective 
CT strategy incorporating the use of compression US to diagnose and treat DVT in 
patients with a high pretest probability of PE.
METHODS: The authors constructed a decision analytic model to evaluate the 
scenario of an otherwise healthy 59-year-old female in whom PE was being 
considered as a diagnosis. Two strategies were used. The selective CT strategy 
began with a screening compression US. Negative studies were followed up with a 
CTA, while patients with positive studies identifying a DVT were treated as 
though they had a PE and were anticoagulated. The universal CT strategy used CTA 
as the initial test, and anticoagulation was based on the CT result. Costs were 
estimated from the 2009 Medicare data for hospital reimbursement, and 
professional fees were obtained from the 2009 National Physician Fee Schedule. 
Clinical probabilities were obtained from existing published data, and 
sensitivity analyses were performed across plausible ranges for all clinical 
variables.
RESULTS: In the base case, the selective CT strategy cost $1,457.70 less than 
the universal CT strategy and resulted in a gain of 0.0213 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses confirm that the selective CT strategy 
is dominant above both a pretest probability for PE of 8.3% and a compression US 
specificity of 87.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: A selective CT strategy using compression US is cost-effective for 
patients provided they have a high pretest probability of PE. This may reduce 
the need for, and decrease the adverse events associated with, CTAs.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge on implant treatment in the partially edentulous patient 
is low for elderly patients aged 80 years or older at inclusion.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to report and compare the clinical and 
radiological performance of implant treatment in edentulous and partially 
edentulous elderly patients during 5 years in function.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Altogether, 192 edentulous (control) and 72 partially 
edentulous (study) patients, consecutively treated and provided with 1,091 and 
265 Brånemark implants, respectively, were included during a period between 
January 1986 and December 2003, and followed-up for 5 years. Clinical 
information was retrospectively retrieved from patient files and intraoral 
radiographs were analyzed for examinations at prosthesis placement and after 1 
and 5 years in function.
RESULTS: Altogether, 92 (48%) control and 24 (33%) study patients were lost to 
follow-up during the 5-year period. In total, 13 (4.9%) and 26 (2.4%) implants 
were in the study and control groups, respectively, were lost during follow-up, 
resulting in a comparable 5-year implant cumulative survival rate ranging from 
93.9% to 99.3% for upper and lower jaws for study and control groups, 
respectively. Comparable mean marginal bone loss during 5 years, ranging from 
0.4 mm to 0.6 mm, was also observed in the groups. The most common complications 
for patients in both study and control group were soft tissue inflammation 
(mucositis). Patients included in the first years of the inclusion (1986-1991) 
period showed comparable results as patient included at the last part of the 
inclusion period (1998-2003).
CONCLUSIONS: Implant treatment in the partially edentulous elderly patients 
showed comparable clinical and radiographic results as elderly patients treated 
in the edentulous jaw.

Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture care as an adjunct to exercise-based physical 
therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee.

BACKGROUND: The delivery of acupuncture alongside mainstream interventions and 
the cost-effectiveness of "alternative" treatments remain areas of controversy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of adding 
acupuncture to a course of advice and exercise delivered by UK National Health 
Service (NHS) physical therapists to people with osteoarthritis of the knee.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was performed alongside a randomized controlled 
trial.
METHODS: A total of 352 adults (aged 50 years or older) were randomly assigned 
to receive 1 of 3 interventions. The primary analysis focused on participants 
receiving advice and exercise (AE) or advice and exercise plus true acupuncture 
(AE+TA). A secondary analysis considered participants receiving advice and 
exercise plus nonpenetrating acupuncture (AE+NPA). The main outcome measures 
were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), measured by the EQ-5D, and UK NHS 
costs.
RESULTS: were expressed as the incremental cost per QALY gained over 12 months. 
Sensitivity analyses included a broader cost perspective to incorporate private 
out-of-pocket costs. Results NHS costs were higher for AE+TA (£314 [British 
pounds sterling]) than for AE alone (£229), and the difference in mean QALYs 
favored AE+TA (mean difference=0.022). The base-case cost per QALY gained was 
£3,889; this value was associated with a 77% probability that AE+TA would be 
more cost-effective than AE at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Cost-utility 
data for AE+NPA provided cost-effectiveness estimates similar to those for 
AE+TA.
LIMITATIONS: As with all trial-based economic evaluations, caution should be 
exercised when generalizing results beyond the study perspectives.
CONCLUSIONS: A package of AE+TA delivered by NHS physical therapists provided a 
cost-effective use of health care resources despite an associated increase in 
costs. However, the economic benefits could not be attributed to the penetrating 
nature of conventional acupuncture; therefore, further research regarding the 
mechanisms of acupuncture is needed. An analysis of alternative cost 
perspectives suggested that the results are generalizable to other health care 
settings.

The elderly as recipients of living donor kidneys, how old is too old?

Cooper M(1), Forland CL.

mcooper@smail.umaryland.edu

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transplantation of the elderly often invokes strong and 
sometimes passionate arguments both in support and in opposition. Age alone has 
not been an absolute contraindication to a life-sustaining organ transplant for 
several decades. A comprehensive evaluation of the risks associated with surgery 
and suppression of the immune system in this often comorbid population becomes 
the focus. Risk for the recipient, however, must continually be evaluated and 
frequently updated in the context of that for the donor.
RECENT FINDINGS: Following careful and critical evaluation, elderly patients 
appreciate the increase in life expectancy and improvements in quality of life 
as demonstrated in their younger counterparts. The outcome of recipients 
receiving kidneys from living donors has demonstrated superior graft and patient 
survival compared to deceased donors. Careful monitoring of medication levels 
for prevention of rejection while avoiding over immunosuppression and infection 
is critical to ensure such benefit.
SUMMARY: Transplantation of the elderly via living donation is not only 
justified but in the appropriately chosen patient, with informed consent of both 
donor and recipient, is ethically sound. The expectations of both parties must 
be clearly stated and donor safety must remain the top priority. Living donors 
must be fully cognizant of the potential risk both in patient and graft survival 
prior to making such a life-changing decision to donate.

Life expectancy and life expectancy with disability of normal weight, 
overweight, and obese smokers and nonsmokers in Europe.

Rotterdam, The Netherlands. i.majer@erasmusmc.nl

The goal of this study was to estimate life expectancy (LE) and LE with 
disability (LwD) among normal weight, overweight, and obese smokers and 
nonsmokers in Western Europe. Data from four waves (1998-2001) of the European 
Community Household Panel (ECHP) were used; a standardized multipurpose annual 
longitudinal survey. Self-reported health and socioeconomic information was 
collected repeatedly using uniform questionnaires for 66,331 individuals in nine 
countries. Health status was measured in terms of disability in daily 
activities. Multistate Markov (MSM) models were applied to obtain hazard ratios 
(HRs) and age-specific transition rates according to BMI and smoking status. 
Multistate life tables were computed using the predicted transition 
probabilities to estimate LE and LwD. Significant associations were observed 
between disability incidence and BMI (HR = 1.15 for overweight, HR = 1.64 for 
obese, compared to normal weight). The risk of mortality was negatively 
associated with overweight status among disabled (HR = 0.77). Overweight people 
had higher LE than people with normal-weight and obesity. Among women, 
overweight and obese nonsmokers expect 3.6 and 6.1 more years of LwD than normal 
weight persons, respectively. In contrast, daily smokers expect lower LE but a 
similar LwD. The same patterns were observed among people with high education 
and those with low education. To conclude, daily smoking is associated with 
mortality more than with disability, whereas obesity is associated with 
disability more than with mortality. The findings suggest that further tobacco 
control would contribute to increasing LE, while tackling the obesity epidemic 
is necessary to prevent an expansion of disability.

Treatment of cancer in the older aged person.

Balducci L.

Cancer is a disease of aging.1 Currently 50% of all malignancies occur in 
individuals 65 and over1 and by the year 2030 older individuals will account for 
70% of all neoplasms.With the aging of the population the management of cancer 
in the older person with chemotherapy is beoming increasingly common. This 
treatment may be safe and effective if some appropriate measures are taken, 
including, an assessment of the physiologic age of each patient, modification of 
doses according to the renal function, use of meyelopoietic growth factors 
prophylactically in presence of moderately toxic chemotherapy, and provision of 
an adequate caregiver. Cure, prolongation of survival, and symptom palliation 
are universal goals of medical treatment. Prolongation of active life expectancy 
should be added to the treatment goal of the older aged person.

As the life expectancy of β-thalassemia patients has markedly improved over the 
last decade, several new complications are being recognized. The presence of a 
high incidence of thromboembolic events, mainly in thalassemia intermedia 
patients, has led to the identification of a hypercoagulable state in 
thalassemia. In this review, the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to 
hypercoagulability in thalassemia are highlighted, and the current clinical 
experience is summarized. Recommendations for thrombosis prophylaxis are also 
discussed.

Crystal structure of tarocystatin-papain complex: implications for the 
inhibition property of group-2 phytocystatins.

University, No 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan, ROC.

Tarocystatin (CeCPI) from taro (Colocasia esculenta cv. Kaohsiung no. 1), a 
group-2 phytocystatin, shares a conserved N-terminal cystatin domain (NtD) with 
other phytocystatins but contains a C-terminal cystatin-like extension (CtE). 
The structure of the tarocystatin-papain complex and the domain interaction 
between NtD and CtE in tarocystatin have not been determined. We resolved the 
crystal structure of the phytocystatin-papain complex at resolution 2.03 Å. 
Surprisingly, the structure of the NtD-papain complex in a stoichiometry of 1:1 
could be built, with no CtE observed. Only two remnant residues of CtE could be 
built in the structure of the CtE-papain complex. Therefore, CtE is easily 
digested by papain. To further characterize the interaction between NtD and CtE, 
three segments of tarocystatin, including the full-length (FL), NtD and CtE, 
were used to analyze the domain-domain interaction and the inhibition ability. 
The results from glutaraldehyde cross-linking and yeast two-hybrid assay 
indicated the existence of an intrinsic flexibility in the region linking NtD 
and CtE for most tarocystatin molecules. In the inhibition activity assay, the 
glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fused FL showed the highest inhibition ability 
without residual peptidase activity, and GST-NtD and FL showed almost the same 
inhibition ability, which was higher than with NtD alone. On the basis of the 
structures, the linker flexibility and inhibition activity of tarocystatins, we 
propose that the overhangs from the cystatin domain may enhance the inhibition 
ability of the cystatin domain against papain.

Gender differences in health and health expectancies of older adults in 
Singapore: an examination of diseases, impairments, and functional disabilities.

Using a nationally representative sample of 4,511 Singaporeans aged 55+ from the 
2005 National Survey of Senior Citizens (NSSC), this paper examines gender 
differences in specific diseases, impairments, and disabilities, and computes 
health expectancies for these health dimensions. Results show that women have 
higher prevalence for hypertension, bone/joint, eye/vision, and walking 
problems, while heart diseases and stroke are more common among men, 
particularly at younger ages. At ages 75+, women have more disabilities related 
to basic activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, 
and feeding) than men. Health expectancies computations by the Sullivan method 
reveal that while women live longer than men, they can also expect more years of 
life both without and with diseases, impairments, and disabilities. At age 65, a 
larger proportion of women's remaining life is with hypertension, bone/joint 
problems, vision impairments, walking difficulties, and functional disabilities 
compared to same-aged men. The findings largely support the gender 
health-survival paradox found in Western countries--that women have higher 
morbidity rates despite longer life expectancy. The morbidity differences 
between men and women, however, vary depending on the particular health 
dimension and measure examined. Older women in Singapore tend to be advantaged 
in prevalence of diseases and disease-free life expectancy, but have more 
impairments and functional disabilities, and a larger proportion of remaining 
life with these difficulties compared to older men. Health policies and programs 
in Singapore will need to cater to these gender differences in specific health 
dimensions and measures.

Inverse probability weighting to control for censoring in a post hoc analysis of 
quality-adjusted survival data from a clinical trial of temsirolimus for renal 
cell carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: This post hoc analysis evaluated treatment-associated 
quality-adjusted survival (QAS) in patients randomly assigned to temsirolimus or 
interferon alfa (IFN-alfa), corrected for censoring using inverse probability 
weighting (IPW), in the Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (ARCC) trial.
METHODS: Follow-up was divided into 11 time intervals; Kaplan-Meier estimates 
for not being censored were estimated for each interval. The QAS for each 
interval was weighted by the inverse probability of not being censored in that 
interval. Overall treatment-associated QAS was calculated as the sum of the 
weighted QAS across all follow-up intervals. Differences in mean QAS between 
temsirolimus and IFN-alfa were evaluated with t-statistics at a two-sided α = 
0.05.
RESULTS: In total, 416 patients were randomly assigned to temsirolimus (n = 209) 
or IFN-alfa (n = 207); 400 patients were included in this analysis. Overall 
weighted mean (standard deviation) QAS during progression-free survival was 
111.9 (5.3) days with temsirolimus (n = 204) and 75.7 (6.3) days with IFN-alfa 
(n = 196). The mean weighted QAS difference of 36.2 days in favor of 
temsirolimus was significant (p < 0.05).
LIMITATIONS: One potential limitation is that the weights developed by the 
Kaplan-Meier estimates did not allow for covariates to be adjusted among 
treatment arms. Another possible limitation is that the ARCC trial included 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, and thus it cannot be conclusively 
determined how our findings would apply to patients with less advanced disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor-prognosis advanced renal cell carcinoma treated 
with temsirolimus had an incremental gain of 48% (36.2 days) in QAS compared 
with patients treated with IFN-alfa.

Successful palliation of dysphagia in patients with inoperable esophageal 
carcinoma has a major effect on quality of life. Self-expanding metal stents 
(SEMS) are currently recommended for rapid symptomatic relief when life 
expectancy is less than 3 months. We assessed complication and reintervention 
rates along with survival outcomes in patients with inoperable esophageal 
carcinoma undergoing stent insertion. A retrospective audit was performed from 
April 2007 to June 2009 for all inoperable primary esophageal carcinoma patients 
who had an esophageal stent inserted for dysphagia. Case notes were reviewed for 
clinical, pathological, stent and complication details, while ICD-10 causes of 
death were obtained from the Department of Health and Social Services, Northern 
Ireland. Fifty-six stents were inserted into 53 patients (66.0% male, mean age 
of 70 years). Inoperability was defined by metastatic spread (n= 34, 64.2%), 
locally advanced disease (n= 7, 13.2%), and severe medical comorbidities (n= 12, 
22.6%). The median time from diagnosis to stent insertion was 109 (interquartile 
range [IQR] 43-187) days. Fifty stents (94.3%) were successfully deployed, while 
three patients (5.7%) required an additional stent as the primary stent had not 
bridged the tumor (proximal deployment = 2, suboptimal stent length = 1). 
Post-SEMS dysphagia scores were significantly better than pre-SEMS scores (2.90 
vs. 1.54, P < 0.001). There were 27 complications identified in 23 (43.4%) 
patients (major complications = 9, minor complications = 14). Twelve patients 
(22.6%) required additional endoscopic procedures. The 30-day mortality rate was 
11.3% (n= 6). Only one patient (1.9%) remains alive with a cumulative median 
survival rate of 84 (IQR 38-156) days. Esophageal stent insertion in this group 
of patients still presents a clinical challenge, with complication and 
endoscopic reintervention rates of 43.4 and 22.6%, respectively. Our results are 
comparable with previously published series, and as a palliative modality stent 
insertion remains appropriate when expected survival is less than 3 months. A 
range of SEMS is currently available with broadly similar efficacy and safety 
profiles. Data regarding the newly available fully covered SEMS suggest that 
they should be avoided.

Progress and delivery of health care in Bhutan, the Land of the Thunder Dragon 
and Gross National Happiness.

The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan is rapidly changing, but it remains relatively 
isolated, and it tenaciously embraces its rich cultural heritage. Despite very 
limited resources, Bhutan is making a concerted effort to update its health care 
and deliver it to all of its citizens. Healthcare services are delivered through 
31 hospitals, 178 basic health unit clinics and 654 outreach clinics that 
provide maternal and child health services in remote communities in the 
mountains. Physical access to primary health care is now well sustained for more 
than 90% of the population. Bhutan has made progress in key health indicators. 
In the past 50 years, life expectancy increased by 18 years and infant mortality 
dropped from 102.8 to 49.3 per 1000 live births between 1984 and 2008. Bhutan 
has a rich medical history. One of the ancient names for Bhutan was 'Land of 
Medicinal Herbs' because of the diverse medicinal plants it exported to 
neighbouring countries. In 1967, traditional medicine was included in the 
National Health System, and in 1971, formal training for Drungtshos (traditional 
doctors) and sMenpas (traditional compounders) began. In 1982, Bhutan 
established the Pharmaceutical and Research Unit, which manufactures, develops 
and researches traditional herbal medicines. Despite commendable achievements, 
considerable challenges lie ahead, but the advances of the past few decades bode 
well for the future.

BACKGROUND: Purchasers can play an important role in eliminating racial and 
ethnic disparities in health care. A need exists to develop a compelling 
"business case" from the employer perspective to put, and keep, the issue of 
racial/ethnic disparities in health care on the quality improvement agenda for 
health plans and providers.
METHODS: To illustrate a method for calculating an employer business case for 
disparity reduction and to compare the business case in two clinical areas, we 
conducted analyses of the direct (medical care costs paid by employers) and 
indirect (absenteeism, productivity) effects of eliminating known racial/ethnic 
disparities in mammography screening and appropriate medication use for patients 
with asthma. We used Markov simulation models to estimate the consequences, for 
defined populations of African-American employees or health plan members, of a 
10% increase in HEDIS mammography rates or a 10% increase in appropriate 
medication use among either adults or children/adolescents with asthma.
RESULTS: The savings per employed African-American woman aged 50-65 associated 
with a 10% increase in HEDIS mammography rate, from direct medical expenses and 
indirect costs (absenteeism, productivity) combined, was $50. The findings for 
asthma were more favorable from an employer point of view at approximately 
$1,660 per person if raising medication adherence rates in African-American 
employees or dependents by 10%.
CONCLUSIONS: For the employer business case, both clinical scenarios modeled 
showed positive results. There is a greater potential financial gain related to 
eliminating a disparity in asthma medications than there is for eliminating a 
disparity in mammography rates.

A well-being support program for patients with severe mental illness: a service 
evaluation.

Eldridge D(1), Dawber N, Gray R.

Author information:
(1)Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, UK.

BACKGROUND: The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with 
severe mental illness (SMI) dramatically reducing life expectancy.
METHOD: A real world pragmatic service evaluation of a Well-Being Support 
Program (WSP) was conducted. This was a four-session package delivered over a 
one-year period by mental health practitioners that had received additional 
training in providing physical health assessment and intervention. Patients' 
physical health was screened and appropriate one-to-one and group intervention 
was offered.
RESULTS: 212 mental health practitioners were trained in the WSP and 782 
patients were enrolled on the program. The majority of our sample was overweight 
or obese; 66% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) >25. Lifestyle risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) were common and the patients had low self esteem. 
The average number of formally recorded well-being sessions attended was 2.10. 
Just under a quarter of those patients enrolled in the program completed. The 
only cardiovascular risk factor that significantly altered in patients that 
completed the program was BMI. The qualitative feedback about the program was 
largely positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The need to intervene to enhance the physical health of people with 
SMI is beyond doubt. Maintaining patient engagement in a physical health 
improvement program is challenging. Regular comprehensive physical health 
monitoring is necessary to establish the benefit of intervention and increase 
life expectancy and well-being in this population.

OBJECTIVE: To study the death burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases 
(COPD) in west rural areas of China in 2004 - 2005.
METHODS: The data from 2004 - 2005 the Third National Mortality Retrospective 
Sampling Survey were used in the study. A total of 28 621 276 person years were 
investigated in west rural areas, which covered 12 provinces, and consisted of 
42 surveillance districts. Based on the data of death cause and population, 
mortality of COPD, years of potential life lost(YPLL) rate, working YPLL (WYPLL) 
rate, YPLL rate due to COPD/YPLL rate due to all deaths in west rural areas were 
calculated and compared with other rural areas. Standardized death rate, 
standardized YPLL (SYPLL) rate, standardized working YPLL (SWYPLL) rate were 
calculated from census data in 2000 as standard population and 2004 - 2005 
national life expectancy as standard life expectancy.
RESULTS: The elder has the higher crude death rate and YPLL rate of COPD in 
survey districts of west rural areas. And the crude death rate of COPD and YPLL 
rate were different in different genders. The YPLL rate was 15.47‰ in male and 
15.73‰ in female. The crude death rate, YPLL rate, WYPLL rate, the ratio of YPLL 
rate due to COPD/YPLL rate due to all deaths in survey districts of west rural 
areas were: 109.53/100 000, 15.76‰, 2.82‰, 11.23%, which were high. While crude 
death rate, YPLL rate, WYPLL rate, the ratio of YPLL rate due to COPD/YPLL rate 
due to all deaths in the poorest survey districts of west rural areas were: 
122.04/100 000, 27.47‰, 4.26‰, 13.44%, which were higher than other 
stratifications of west rural areas.
CONCLUSION: The death burden of COPD in west rural areas in 2004 - 2005 was the 
heaviest one in China which experienced the feature that the poorer the rural 
regions, the heavier the death burden.

Comparison of costs and benefits of breast cancer screening with mammography, 
ultrasonography, and MRI.

92868, USA. sfeig@uci.edu

Screening mammography performed annually on all women beginning at age 40 years 
has reduced breast cancer deaths by 30% to 50%. The cost per year of life saved 
is well within the range for other commonly accepted medical interventions. 
Various studies have estimated that reduction in treatment costs through early 
screening detection may be 30% to 100% or more of the cost of screening. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening is also cost-effective for very 
high-risk women, such as BRCA carriers, and others at 20% or greater lifetime 
risk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MRI is cost-effective for 
those at moderately high (15%-20%) lifetime risk. Future technical advances 
could make MRI more cost-effective than it is today. Automated whole-breast 
ultrasonography will probably prove cost-effective as a supplement to 
mammography for women with dense breasts.

PURPOSE: A recent increase in the detection of contrast enhancing renal masses 4 
cm or smaller suspicious for malignancy has led to the widespread use of nephron 
sparing options. Limited data exist to help clinicians decide which of these 
competing nephron sparing therapies is most appropriate. We performed a 
cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the relative clinical and economic 
merits of commonly available nephron sparing strategies for small renal masses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model estimating 
the costs and health outcomes of treating a healthy 65-year-old patient with an 
asymptomatic unilateral small renal mass using competing nephron sparing options 
of immediate intervention (ie open and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy as well 
as laparoscopic and percutaneous ablation), active surveillance with possible 
delayed intervention and nonsurgical management with observation. Benefits were 
measured in quality adjusted life-years. We used a societal perspective, 
lifetime horizon and willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per quality 
adjusted life-year gained. Model results were assessed with sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario the least costly option was observation and 
the optimal option was immediate laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, which had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,645 per quality adjusted life-year 
gained compared to surveillance with possible delayed percutaneous ablation. 
Results were sensitive to age at diagnosis, health status and tumor size.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is the preferred nephron 
sparing option for healthy patients younger than 74 years old with a small renal 
mass. Surveillance with possible delayed percutaneous ablation is a 
cost-effective alternative for patients with advanced age or significant 
comorbidities. Observation maximizes quality adjusted life-years in patients who 
are poor surgical candidates or with limited life expectancy (less than 3 
years).

Individualized decision-making for older men with prostate cancer: balancing 
cancer control with treatment consequences across the clinical spectrum.

Sajid S(1), Mohile SG, Szmulewitz R, Posadas E, Dale W.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent non-skin cancer among men and is the 
second leading cause of cancer death in men. PCa has an increased incidence and 
prevalence in older men. Age-associated incidence is on the rise due to 
increased screening in the older population. This has led to a sharp rise in the 
detection of early stage PCa. Given the indolent nature of many prostatic 
malignancies, a large proportion of older men with PCa will ultimately die from 
other causes. As a result, physicians and patients are faced with the challenge 
of identifying optimal treatment strategies for localized PCa, biochemically 
recurrent PCa and later-stage PCa. Age-related changes can impact tolerance of 
hormonal therapy and chemotherapy in men with metastatic disease and shift the
