People with HIV on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) have longer life 
expectancy and are increasingly experiencing age-related comorbidities. Thus, 
aging with HIV has become a central issue in clinical care and research, which 
has been particularly challenging with the intersection of the ongoing 
coronavirus (COVID)-19 pandemic. Since 2009, the International Workshop on HIV 
and Aging has served as a multidisciplinary platform to share research findings 
from cross-disciplinary fields along with community advocates to address 
critical issues in HIV and aging. In this article, we summarize the key oral 
presentations from the 12th Annual International Workshop on HIV and Aging, held 
virtually on September 23rd and 24th, 2021. The topics ranged from basic science 
research on biological mechanisms of aging to quality of life and delivery of 
care under the COVID-19 pandemic. This workshop enriched our understanding of 
HIV and aging under the COVID-19 pandemic, identified challenges and 
opportunities to combat the impact of COVID-19 on HIV communities, and also 
provided updated research and future directions of the field to move HIV and 
aging research forward, with the ultimate goal of successful aging for older 
people with HIV.

Estranged and Unhappy? Examining the Dynamics of Personal and Relationship 
Well-Being Surrounding Infidelity.

Although relationship theories often describe infidelity as a damaging event in 
a couple's life, it remains unclear whether relationship problems actually 
follow infidelity, precede it, or both. The analyses of dyadic panel data of 
adults in Germany including about 1,000 infidelity events showed that infidelity 
was preceded (but not followed) by a gradual decrease in relationship 
functioning in perpetrators and victims. There was little evidence of rebound 
effects in the aftermath of infidelity, with the exception of unfaithful women 
and individuals with lower initial relationship commitment who returned to the 
pre-event level of well-being or even exceeded it, providing support to the 
expectancy violation theory (vs. the investment model of infidelity). By showing 
that well-being starts to decline before infidelity happens, this study provides 
a differentiated view on the temporal dynamics of infidelity and well-being and 
contributes to the literature on romantic relationship dynamics and major life 
events.

BACKGROUND: The growing need of nursing care as life expectancy increases is a 
problem. The Netzwerk AktivGesund (NWGA) tries to change this development in a 
positive way. In a pilot region of the city of Hamburg, persons 70 years and 
older were invited by their health insurance companies to participate in the 
NWGA supportive network. Results of the acceptance analysis are described here.
METHODS: In order to focus on persons at risk of need for help functional 
competence was assessed by using the LUCAS functional ability index (selfreport 
questionnaire). In an explorative way, participants, refusers, persons 
interested (excluded due to high functional competence), and non-responders were 
compared in a retrospective observational study. Sociodemographic and routine 
data were used as ICD diagnoses from hospitalisations, number of contacts to 
physicians and level of need of nursing care during the 12 months before 
recruitment.
RESULTS: There were 962 participants (7.4 %), 948 refusers (7.2 %), 2437 persons 
with interest (18.6 %) and 8753 non-responders (66.8 %) from the 13 100 persons 
contacted by mail. The sociodemographic factors differed between these groups. 
ICDs typical of older patients and ICD codes of functional impairment from the 
5422 hospital stays showed different frequencies. Persons with interest had 
nearly no need of nursing care and the lowest level of morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that impairments of motoric and cognitive 
functions, in particular, and sociodemographic factors have impact on the 
acceptance of the NWGA. The recruitment for participation should be improved 
using approaches that are differentiated, respectively. Awareness of functional 
impairment as disease sequelae and pacemaker of need of nursing care, in 
general, might facilitate health promotion and prevention in older persons. An 
interest in preventative activities was remarkably frequent among the persons 70 
years and older.

Publisher: EINLEITUNG: Häufigere Pflegebedürftigkeit bei steigender 
Lebenserwartung ist problematisch. Das NetzWerk GesundAktiv (NWGA) nimmt 
positive Beeinflussbarkeit der Entwicklung von Pflegebedürftigkeit an. In einer 
Pilotregion Hamburgs luden gesetzliche Krankenversicherungen ihre Versicherten 
im Alter ab 70 Jahren zur Teilnahme am NWGA Hilfs- und Betreuungsnetzwerk ein. 
Hier werden die Ergebnisse der Akzeptanzanalyse dargestellt.
METHODEN: Zur Fokussierung auf die Zielgruppe der für die Entwicklung von 
Pflegebedürftigkeit gefährdeten Personen wurde der LUCAS Funktions-Index 
(Selbstausfüll-Fragebogen) als Screening für den Grad funktionaler Kompetenz 
verwendet. Die retrospektive Beobachtungsstudie untersuchte explorativ NWGA 
Teilnehmende, Ablehnende, Interessenten (Ausschluss, da funktional kompetent) 
und Non-Responder anhand sozio-demografischer sowie Morbiditätsbezogener 
Routinedaten. Dafür wurden ICD-Diagnosen anlässlich stationärer 
Krankenhausaufenthalte, die Anzahl ambulanter Arztkontakte sowie Pflegegrade 
innerhalb 12 Monaten vor Rekrutierung verwendet.
ERGEBNISSE: Von 13 100 angeschriebenen Versicherten waren 962 Teilnehmende 
(7,4 %), 948 Ablehnende (7,2 %), 2437 Interessenten (18,6 %) und 8753 
Non-Responder (66,8 %). Bezüglich soziodemografischer Merkmale unterschieden 
sich diese Gruppen. Die Diagnosen von 5422 Krankenhausaufenthalten zeigten 
unterschiedlich häufige ICD-Codes funktionaler Beeinträchtigungen. Interessenten 
waren praktisch nicht pflegebedürftig und wiesen die niedrigste Morbidität auf.
DISKUSSION: Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass Beeinträchtigungen 
insbesondere motorischer und kognitiver Funktionen sowie soziodemografische 
Merkmale die NWGA-Akzeptanz beeinflussen. Die Ansprache zur Teilnahme sollte 
entsprechend differenziert verbessert werden. Die Berücksichtigung funktionaler 
Störungen als Krankheitsfolgen und Schrittmacher von Pflegebedürftigkeit könnte 
Gesundheitsförderung und Prävention im Alter generell stärken. Das Interesse für 
präventive Aktivitäten war unter den 70-jährigen und älteren Menschen 
nennenswert häufig.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CKD imposes a significant burden on patients and 
health care providers, particularly upon reaching kidney failure when patients 
may require KRT. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD 
(DAPA-CKD) trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin, with standard therapy, reduced 
CKD progression and KRT requirement. The study objective was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin for the treatment of CKD from payer 
perspectives in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We constructed a lifetime Markov 
model to characterize outcomes in patients with CKD on the basis of the DAPA-CKD 
trial. Health states were defined by eGFR level and KRT type. Direct health care 
costs and utility values were sourced from published literature and the DAPA-CKD 
trial, respectively. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum in the 
United Kingdom and 3% in Germany and Spain.
RESULTS: In patients eligible for the DAPA-CKD trial, treatment with 
dapagliflozin was predicted to reduce rates of CKD progression, with patients 
predicted to spend 1.7 (95% credibility interval, 0.8 to 2.4) more years in the 
eGFR range 15-89 ml/min per 1.73 m2 versus standard therapy alone (12.1; 95% 
credibility interval, 8.9 to 14.1 versus 10.4; 95% credibility interval, 7.7 to 
12.4 years). Life expectancy (undiscounted) was correspondingly predicted to 
increase by 1.7 (95% credibility interval, 0.7 to 2.5) years (15.5; 95% 
credibility interval, 11.1 to 18.2 versus 13.8; 95% credibility interval, 9.9 to 
16.5 years). This in addition to reduced incidence of adverse clinical outcomes, 
including hospitalization for heart failure, resulted in modeled 
quality-adjusted life year (discounted) gains between 0.82 (95% credibility 
interval, 0.38 to 1.18) and 1.00 (95% credibility interval, 0.46 to 1.41). These 
gains translated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $8280, $17,623, and 
$11,687 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain, respectively, indicating 
cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds (United Kingdom: $27,510 per 
quality-adjusted life year; Germany and Spain: $35,503 per quality-adjusted life 
year).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients meeting the eligibility requirements for the DAPA-CKD 
trial, dapagliflozin is likely to be a cost-effective treatment within the UK, 
German, and Spanish health care systems.

Objective: To investigate Chinese myocarditis burden and trends in 1990 and 
2019. Methods: Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data, the number 
of patients, the number of new cases, the number of deaths, the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), as well as the morbidity, mortality, 
DALYs rate and their age-standardized rates were used to analyze the trend and 
the burden of myocarditis in the Chinese population in 1990 and 2019. Results: 
In 2019, the number of patients, the number of new cases and the number of 
deaths with myocarditis in China were 234 900, 275 100 and 13 100 respectively, 
increasing by 85.62%, 47.51% and 50.22% compared with 1990. The age-standardized 
incidence and mortality were 16.94/100 000 and 0.92/100 000, respectively. 
Compared with 1990, the age-standardized incidence in 2019 decreased by 6.06%, 
and the mortality decreased by 16.04% respectively. The age-standardized 
incidence and mortality of Chinese male patients with myocarditis were higher 
than that of female. Compared with 1990, the age group with the largest 
incidence and mortality of myocarditis in China in 2019 all shifted to the elder 
group. And, DALYs and age-normalized DALYs due to myocarditis in China showed a 
decreasing trend in 2019, from 458 600 and 42.51/100 000 in 1990 to 341 300 and 
25.39/100 000 in 2019, respectively. The rate of DALYs and age-standardized 
DALYs in male patients was always higher than female. Conclusions: Compared with 
1990, the overall burden of myocarditis in China showed a downward trend in 
2019, and the burden of myocarditis in male patients was higher than female. 
More attention should be paid to the burden of myocarditis in Chinese elderly 
population.

Publisher: 目的： 分析1990年和2019年中国人群心肌炎疾病负担及其变化趋势。 方法： 
基于全球疾病负担（GBD）1990年和2019年数据，采用患病人数、新发病例人数、死亡人数、伤残调整寿命年（DALYs）以及年龄标化发病率、病死率、DALYs率等指标，分析中国人群罹患心肌炎的疾病负担变化趋势。 
结果： 
2019年中国心肌炎患病人数、新发病例人数及死亡人数分别为23.49万、27.51万、1.31万例，相较于1990年分别增长了85.62%、47.51%和50.22%。发病率和病死率分别为16.94/10万、0.92/10万。相较于1990年分别下降了6.06%和16.04%。中国男性心肌炎患者的年龄标化发病率及病死率均高于女性。与1990年相比，2019年中国人群心肌炎患病人数、发病人数、死亡人数最多的年龄段均向高龄人群转变，且因心肌炎导致的DALYs和年龄标化DALYs率均呈下降趋势，分别由1990年的45.86万人年和42.51/10万降至2019年的34.13万人年和25.39/10万，男性患者的DALYs和年龄标化DALYs率总是高于女性。 
结论： 与1990年比较，2019年中国心肌炎的疾病负担总体呈下降趋势，男性人群心肌炎疾病负担高于女性，且中国老年人群的心肌炎疾病负担需要给予更多的关注。.

BACKGROUND: A national, lung cancer screening programme is under consideration 
in Australia, and we assessed cost-effectiveness using updated data and 
assumptions.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of lung screening by applying 
screening parameters and outcomes from either the National Lung Screening Trial 
(NLST) or the NEderlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings ONderzoek (NELSON) to 
Australian data on lung cancer risk, mortality, health-system costs, and smoking 
trends using a deterministic, multi-cohort model. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) were calculated for a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: The ICER for lung screening compared to usual care in the NELSON-based 
scenario was AU$39,250 (95% CI $18,150-108,300) per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY); lower than the NLST-based estimate (ICER = $76,300, 95% CI 
$41,750-236,500). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, lung screening was 
cost-effective in 15%/60% of NELSON-like simulations, assuming a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $30,000/$50,000 per QALY, respectively, compared 
to 0.5%/6.7% for the NLST. ICERs were most sensitive to assumptions regarding 
the screening-related lung cancer mortality benefit and duration of benefit over 
time. The cost of screening had a larger impact on ICERs than the cost of 
treatment, even after quadrupling the 2006-2016 healthcare costs of stage IV 
lung cancer.
DISCUSSION: Lung screening could be cost-effective in Australia, contingent on 
translating trial-like lung cancer mortality benefits to the clinic.

BACKGROUND: Diplopia is an important and debilitating symptom of malignancies 
due to different pathogenetic mechanisms. Data is lacking in the literature 
because of the rarity of the diplopia in patients with cancer.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the etiological and clinical factors of diplopia in 
patients with different types of cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 22 cancer patients with diplopia who 
were admitted between 2018 and 2021. The diagnosis of primary cancer, the 
underlying factors causing diplopia, and the life expectancy after diplopia were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Among available data of 620 cancer patients applied to our 
ophthalmology department, 22 (3.55%) had diplopia. Paralytic strabismus was 
found in 19 patients and restrictive strabismus was found in 3 patients. Among 
the paralytic cases, 6th nerve palsy was found to be the most common with a rate 
of 68%. In 18 of 22 (82%) patients, the cause of diplopia was due to orbital or 
brain metastasis or local invasion. Two patients had diplopia secondary to 
radiotherapy and 2 had diplopia due to chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Metastasis is the most common cause of diplopia in patients with 
cancer and screening for metastasis is crucial as soon as diplopia begins for a 
better life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia are the main 
asbestos-producing countries, and all forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to 
humans. The objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden 
attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019 in major producing countries, 
including Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
METHODS: Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates (ASDR) of disease burden attributable 
to asbestos by country, age, and sex were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2019. Percentage change and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) 
were used to assess the trends of ASDR and ASMR of disease burden attributable 
to asbestos between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: Asbestos-related diseases were highly heterogeneous across Global, 
Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. There was a downward trend in ASMR and 
ASDR of diseases burden related to asbestos globally. The age-specific mortality 
rate of disease attributable to asbestos increased in men and women, although it 
decreased in women aged 85-89, the highest age-specific mortality rate were 
observed in age 95 + group in men [162.14 (95% UI: 103.76-215.45)] and women 
[30.58 (95% UI: 14.83-44.33)] per 100 000 population, respectively. Tracheal, 
bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause of death and DALYS 
attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019 globally and in Brazil, China, 
Kazakhstan, and Russia. China had the highest percentage change (73.31%) and 
EAPC [3.41 (95% CI: 2.75-4.08)] in ASMR related to exposure to asbestos in men, 
with the highest percentage change (73.31%) and EAPC [3.41 (95% CI: 2.75-4.08)] 
in ASDR in men.
CONCLUSIONS: The ASMR and ASDR of disease burden attributable to asbestos 
decreased between 1990 and 2019 globally. TBL cancer was the leading cause of 
death and DALYs attributable to asbestos between 1990 and 2019. There has been 
an increasing trend in mortality and DALYs globally, especially in older men. 
The burden of disease attributable to asbestos is increasing in China, 
especially in men.

University, Warsaw, Poland.

The mortality rates ( μx,t ) measure the frequency of deaths in a fixed: 
population and time interval. The ability to model and forecast μx,t allows 
determining, among others, fundamental characteristics of life expectancy 
tables, e.g. used to determine the amount of premium in life insurance, adequate 
to the risk of death. The article proposes a new method of modelling and 
forecasting μx,t , using the class of stochastic Milevsky-Promislov switch 
models with excitations. The excitations are modelled by second, fourth and 
sixth order polynomials of outputs from the non-Gaussian Linear Scalar Filter 
(nGLSF) model and taking into account the Markov (Set) chain. The Markov (Set) 
chain state space is defined based on even orders of the nGLSF polynomial. The 
model order determines the theoretical values of the death rates. The obtained 
results usually provide a more precise forecast of the mortality rates than the 
commonly used Lee-Carter model.

Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection was discovered over 50 years ago; 
however, the serious clinical changes associated with FeLV infection still have 
great importance in the diagnosis, prevention, and clinical management of 
symptomatic patients. Progressive infection with FeLV leads to a reduction in 
the patient's life expectancy and quality of life. This report describes the use 
of an antiretroviral integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, in two cats with natural 
FeLV infection. Raltegravir was administered orally at a dose of 40 mg/cat every 
12 h in both cases. In case one, 13 weeks after starting raltegravir, RNA loads 
were undetectable, while proviral DNA loads were still detectable. In case two, 
proviral DNA loads were undetectable after 32 weeks of medication, while RNA 
loads were undetectable throughout the treatment. No adverse effects or 
laboratory test abnormalities were detected with the use of raltegravir in 
either patient. The patients are currently clinically healthy, still receiving 
the drug, and are under close observation. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report describing the use of raltegravir in naturally infected FeLV-positive 
cats and its effects on circulating viral load. Moreover, the patients described 
here were followed-up for a longer period than those in previously reported 
cases.

Publisher: A infecção pelo vírus da leucemia felina foi descoberta há mais de 50 
anos, mas as graves alterações clínicas associadas à infecção pelo FeLV, ainda 
denotam grande importância no diagnóstico, nas medidas de prevenção e no manejo 
clínico de pacientes sintomáticos. A infecção progressiva pelo FeLV acarreta na 
redução do tempo e qualidade de vida do paciente. Este relato descreve o uso de 
um antirretroviral inibidor da integrase, o raltegravir, em dois gatos com 
infecção natural pelo FeLV. O raltegravir foi utilizado na dose de 40 mg/gato 
por via oral a cada 12 horas em ambos os casos. No primeiro caso após treze 
semanas do uso do raltegravir, a quantificação de RNA foi indetectável e no 
segundo caso, após trinta e duas semanas o número de cópias de DNA pró-viral foi 
indetectável. A carga de RNA nunca foi detectada neste paciente. Nenhum efeito 
adverso, nem alterações laboratoriais foram detectadas com o uso do raltegravir 
em ambos os casos. Atualmente, os pacientes encontram-se clinicamente saudáveis, 
fazem uso do antiretroviral com monitorização contínua. Este é o primeiro relato 
que descreve o uso do raltegravir em gatos infectados naturalmente pelo FeLV e 
seus efeitos na carga viral circulante. Além disso, os pacientes descritos aqui 
foram acompanhados por um período maior que os trabalhos anteriores descritos.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure are global health problems 
associated with morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, with unequal access 
to kidney replacement therapy between countries. The diversity of guidelines 
concerning referral from primary care to a specialist nephrologist determines 
different outcomes around the world among patients with CKD where several 
guidelines recommend referral when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
is <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 regardless of age. Additionally, fixed non-age-adapted 
diagnostic criteria for CKD that do not distinguish correctly between normal 
kidney senescence and true kidney disease can lead to overdiagnosis of CKD in 
the elderly and underdiagnosis of CKD in young patients and contributes to the 
unfair referral of CKD patients to a kidney specialist. Non-age-adapted 
recommendations contribute to unnecessary referral in the very elderly with a 
mild disease where the risk of death consistently exceeds the risk of 
progression to kidney failure and ignore the possibility of effective 
interventions of a young patient with long life expectancy. The opportunity of 
mitigating CKD progression and cardiovascular complications in young patients 
with early stages of CKD is a task entrusted to primary care providers who are 
possibly unable to optimally accomplish guideline-directed medical therapy for 
this purpose. The shortage in the nephrology workforce has classically led to 
focused referral on advanced CKD stages preparing for kidney replacement, but 
the need for hasty referral to a nephrologist because of the urgent requirement 
for kidney replacement therapy in advanced CKD is still observed and changes are 
required to move toward reducing the kidney failure burden. The Kidney Failure 
Risk Equation (KFRE) is a novel tool that can guide wiser nephrology referrals 
and impact patients.

When digging in the ground during egg laying the female locust extends her 
abdomen to 2-3 times of its original length. How the abdominal nervous system 
accommodates such extreme elongation remains unknown. We characterized and 
quantified the system's biomechanical response using controlled ex vivo 
elongation and force measurements. The microstructure of the nerves was studied 
using histology and high-resolution confocal microscopy. Although the nervous 
system of sexually mature females demonstrated fully reversible 
hyper-extensibility of up to 275%, the elongation observed in premature females 
and males was much more limited. The unique extension dynamics of the different 
groups were captured by their very different force-displacement curves. Confocal 
microscopy suggested that elongation is not owing to undulations of the nervous 
system structure. Thus, the exceptional resistance to deformation and rupture 
presents the female locust abdominal nervous system as a valuable model for 
understanding the functionality and pathology related to nerve extension and 
reversible elongation.

BACKGROUND: Subjective life expectancy (SLE) is a vital predictor of mortality, 
health and retirement. Nevertheless, we have sparse knowledge about what drives 
changes in SLE. Having a chronic health condition (CHC) is probably associated 
with a change SLE. However, how CHCs are associated with changes in SLE may 
depend on whether the CHC was newly diagnosed and the type of CHC.
AIM: We hypothesize that newly diagnosed CHCs will be strongly negatively 
associated with changes in SLE than existing CHCs. As CHCs vary in their 
presentation and prognosis, we differentiate associations between five CHCs - 
arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, sleep disorders, psychological disorders and 
life-threatening conditions - and changes in SLE.
METHOD: Data from two waves of a Dutch pension panel survey, collected 3 years 
apart in 2015 and 2018, were used. The analytical sample included 4824 older 
workers between the ages of 60-65 years at wave 1. Data were analysed 
longitudinally using a conditional change ordered logistic regression model.
RESULTS: In general, newly diagnosed CHCs were strongly negatively associated 
with changes in SLE, relative to having no CHCs. Existing CHCs were also 
negatively associated with changes in SLE, but to a weaker strength. 
Interestingly, associations between CHCs and the change in SLE differed based on 
the CHC in question.
CONCLUSION: Newly diagnosed life-threatening conditions, psychological disorders 
and cardiovascular diseases are strongly negatively associated with changes in 
SLE. These results provide insight into the differences in how older workers 
with CHCs experience late career work and how these experiences influence their 
SLE.

Fear and anxiety are crucial for adaptive responding in life-threatening 
situations. Whereas fear is a phasic response to an acute threat accompanied by 
selective attention, anxiety is characterized by a sustained feeling of 
apprehension and hypervigilance during situations of potential threat. In the 
current literature, fear and anxiety are usually considered mutually exclusive, 
with partially separated neural underpinnings. However, there is accumulating 
evidence that challenges this distinction between fear and anxiety, and 
simultaneous activation of fear and anxiety networks has been reported. 
Therefore, the current study experimentally tested potential interactions 
between fear and anxiety. Fifty-two healthy participants completed a 
differential fear conditioning paradigm followed by a test phase in which the 
conditioned stimuli were presented in front of threatening or neutral contextual 
images. To capture defense system activation, we recorded subjective (threat, 
US-expectancy), physiological (skin conductance, heart rate) and visuocortical 
(steady-state visual evoked potentials) responses to the conditioned stimuli as 
a function of contextual threat. Results demonstrated successful fear 
conditioning in all measures. In addition, threat and US-expectancy ratings, 
cardiac deceleration, and visuocortical activity were enhanced for fear cues 
presented in threatening compared with neutral contexts. These results are in 
line with an additive or interactive rather than an exclusive model of fear and 
anxiety, indicating facilitated defensive behavior to imminent danger in 
situations of potential threat.

How to apply treatment recommendations from various knowledgeable specialist 
societies concerning the very complex patient? Within a population weakened by 
the cumulative effect of comorbidities, loss of autonomy aggravated by geriatric 
syndromes and biological changes linked to aging which interact with the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, there is fertile soil for the 
advent of adverse conditions linked to simultaneously prescribing multiple 
treatments. Our aim is to analyze various clinical reasoning tools permitting an 
appropriate drug prescription while considering the state of health, life 
expectancy and time to benefit with the aim of reducing iatrogenesis.

Publisher: Comment mettre en pratique les recommandations de prise en charge 
médicamenteuse suggérées par les différentes sociétés savantes de spécialistes 
face à un patient âgé non robuste ? Dans une population fragilisée par le cumul 
des comorbidités, les handicaps liés aux syndromes gériatriques et les 
modifications biologiques liées au vieillissement, le terrain est fertile pour 
la survenue d’effets indésirables lors de la prescription simultanée de 
plusieurs médicaments. Nous analysons dans cet article divers aides au 
raisonnement clinique menant à la prescription d’une médication adaptée aux 
objectifs partagés avec le patient, en tenant compte de l’état de santé, de 
l’espérance de vie et du temps nécessaire au bénéfice escompté de la 
prescription, afin de pallier toute iatrogénie.

PURPOSE: Globally, spine disorders are the leading cause of disability, 
affecting more than half a billion individuals. However, less than 50% of G20 
countries specifically identify spine health within their public policy 
priorities. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness among policy makers of 
the disabling effect of spine disorders and their impact on the economic welfare 
of G20 nations. In 2019, SPINE20 was established as the leading advocacy group 
to bring global attention to spine disorders.
METHODS: Recommendations were developed through two Delphi methods with 
international and multi-professional panels.
RESULTS: In 2022, seven recommendations were delivered to the leaders of G20 
countries, urging them to: Develop action plans to provide universal access to 
evidence-based spine care that incorporates the needs of minorities and 
vulnerable populations. Invest in the development of sustainable human resource 
capacity, through multisectoral and inter-professional competency-based 
education and training to promote evidence-based approaches to spine care, and 
to build an appropriate healthcare working environment that optimizes the 
delivery of safe health services. Develop policies using the best available 
evidence to properly manage spine disorders and to prolong functional healthy 
life expectancy in the era of an aging population. Create a competent workforce 
and improve the healthcare infrastructure/facilities including equipment to 
provide evidence-based inter-professional rehabilitation services to patients 
with spinal cord injury throughout their continuum of care. Build collaborative 
and innovative translational research capacity within national, regional, and 
global healthcare systems for state-of-the-art and cost-effective spine care 
across the healthcare continuum ensuring equality, diversity, and inclusion of 
all stakeholders. Develop international consensus statements on patient outcomes 
and how they can be used to define and develop pathways for value-based care. 
Recognize that intervening on determinants of health including physical 
activity, nutrition, physical and psychosocial workplace environment, and 
smoking-free lifestyle can reduce the burden of spine disabilities and improve 
the health status and wellness of the population. At the third SPINE20 summit 
2022 which took place in Bali, Indonesia, in August 2022, 17 associations 
endorsed its recommendations.
CONCLUSION: SPINE20 advocacy efforts focus on developing public policy 
recommendations to improve the health, welfare, and wellness of all who suffer 
from spinal pain and disability. We propose that focusing on facilitating access 
to systems that prioritize value-based care delivered by a competent healthcare 
workforce will reduce disability and improve the productivity of the G20 
nations.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We discuss the relationship between sleep and circadian 
factors with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, including physiologic, 
behavioral, and psychological mechanisms along this pathway.
RECENT FINDINGS: The relationship between short and long sleep duration, as well 
as insomnia, with CVD risk is well-established. Recent work has highlighted how 
other sleep factors, such as sleep regularity (i.e., consistency of sleep 
timing), multidimensional sleep health, and circadian factors like chronotype 
and social jetlag, relate to CVD risk. Sleep-focused interventions (e.g., 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and sleep extension) may be effective 
to reduce CVD risk and disease burden. Sleep is increasingly recognized as an 
integral component of cardiovascular health. This was underscored by the recent 
inclusion of sleep duration as a health behavior in the American Heart 
Association's Life's Essential 8 for defining optimal cardiovascular health.
