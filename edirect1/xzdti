INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 induces venous, arterial and microvascular thrombosis, 
involving several pathophysiological processes. In patients with severe COVID-19 
without macrovascular thrombosis, escalating into high-dose prophylactic 
anticoagulation (HD-PA) or therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) could be beneficial 
in limiting the extension of microvascular thrombosis and forestalling the 
evolution of lung and multiorgan microcirculatory dysfunction. In the absence of 
data from randomised trials, clinical practice varies widely.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a French multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, 
randomised controlled superiority trial to compare the efficacy and safety of 
three anticoagulation strategies in patients with COVID-19. Patients with 
oxygen-treated COVID-19 showing no pulmonary artery thrombosis on computed 
tomography with pulmonary angiogram will be randomised to receive either 
low-dose PA, HD-PA or TA for 14 days. Patients attaining the extremes of weight 
and those with severe renal failure will not be included. We will recruit 353 
patients. Patients will be randomised on a 1:1:1 basis, and stratified by 
centre, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, D-dimer levels and body mass 
index. The primary endpoint is a hierarchical criterion at day 28 including 
all-cause mortality, followed by the time to clinical improvement defined as the 
time from randomisation to an improvement of at least two points on the ordinal 
clinical scale. Secondary outcomes include thrombotic and major bleeding events 
at day 28, individual components of the primary endpoint, number of oxygen-free, 
ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days at day 28, D-dimer and sepsis-induced 
coagulopathy score at day 7, intensive care unit and hospital stay at day 28 and 
day 90, and all-cause death and quality of life at day 90.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by an ethical committee 
(Ethics Committee, Ile de France VII, Paris, France; reference 2020-A03531-38). 
Patients will be included after obtaining their signed informed consent. The 
results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: Technological advances have led to cancer prognostication that is 
increasingly accurate but often unalterable. However, a reliable prognosis of 
limited life expectancy can cause psychological distress. People should 
carefully consider offers of prognostication, but little is known about how and 
why they decide on prognostication. Using uveal melanoma (UM) patients, we aimed 
to identify (i) how and why do people with UM decide to accept prognostication 
and (ii) alignment and divergence of their decision-making from 
conceptualizations of a 'well-considered' decision.
METHODS: UM provides a paradigm to elucidate clinical and ethical perspectives 
on prognostication, because prognostication is reliable but prognoses are 
largely nonameliorable. We used qualitative methods to examine how and why 20 UM 
people with UM chose prognostication. We compared findings to a template of 
'well-considered' decision-making, where 'well-considered' decisions involve 
consideration of all likely outcomes.
RESULTS: Participants wanted prognostication to reduce future worry about 
uncertain life expectancy. They spontaneously spoke of hoping for a good 
prognosis when making their decisions, but largely did not consider the 50% 
possibility of a poor prognosis. When pressed, they argued that a poor outcome 
at least brings certainty.
CONCLUSIONS: While respecting decisions as valid expressions of participants' 
wishes, we are concerned that they did not explicitly consider the realistic 
possibility of a poor outcome and how this would affect them. Thus, it is 
difficult to see their decisions as 'well-considered'. We propose that 
nondirective preference exploration techniques could help people to consider the 
possibility of a poor outcome.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This paper is a direct response to a 
patient-identified and defined problem that arose in therapeutic and 
conversational discourse. The research was informed by the responses of patient 
participants, as we used the material from interviews to dynamically shape the 
interview guide. Thus, participants' ideas drove the analysis and shaped the 
interviews to come.

In order to better study the characteristics of the pore structure and to 
explore the influence factors of its fractal dimensions during the thermal 
evolution of oil shale, the immature oil shale (T max = 433 °C, TOC = 28.00%) of 
the Ordos Basin Extension Group was selected to simulate the whole thermal 
evolution process from immature to over mature in a semiopen system. Organic 
geochemical data show that the thermal simulation hydrocarbon generation 
threshold is between 300 and 400 °C. According to AIP-SEM observation, the pore 
types of the samples are different in different thermal simulation stages. The 
fractal dimensions are calculated by low-temperature N2 adsorption data using 
the fractal Frenkel-Halsey-Hill fractal model. The average surface fractal 
dimension (D 1) is 2.26, indicating that the pore (<4 nm) surface is relatively 
smooth. The average pore structure fractal dimension (D 2) is 2.49, indicating 
that the pore (>4 nm) structure is complex. Through the exploration of the 
relationship between fractal dimensions and organic geochemistry, whole rock 
X-ray diffraction, and N2 adsorption data, it is found that fractal dimensions 
have different degrees of correlation with thermal maturity, mineral 
composition, TOC content, and pore parameters. Through comprehensive research, 
it shows that hydrocarbon generation and expulsion, oil and gas cracking, and 
organic matter carbonization have important effects on the pore structure and 
fractal characteristics of oil shale.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic angiosarcoma is an uncommon, malignant, primary liver tumor, 
comprising 2% of liver cancers and accounting for < 1% of all sarcomas. Patients 
usually present with nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, right 
upper quadrant pain, anemia, which leads to late diagnosis of an advanced stage 
tumor. The median life expectancy after the diagnosis of hepatic angiosarcoma is 
about 6 months, with only 3% of patients surviving more than 2 years. Liver 
failure and hemoperitoneum are the leading causes of death in patients with 
liver angiosarcoma. In rarer cases, it might cause paraneoplastic syndromes such 
as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The treatment of angiosarcomas is 
complicated as there are no established and effective treatment guidelines due 
to the tumor's low frequency and aggressive nature.
CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 68-year old woman who was admitted to the 
hospital due to fatigue and severe anemia (hemoglobin 65 g/l). Laboratory 
results also revealed high-grade thrombocytopenia (8 × 109/l). The abdominal 
ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed multiple lesions throughout the 
liver, spleen and kidneys. After the histological examination of the liver 
biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with hepatic angiosarcoma. The treatment with 
first-line chemotherapy (doxorubicin) was initiated despite ongoing 
paraneoplastic syndrome - disseminative intravascular coagulopathy. However, the 
disease was terminal, and the patient died 2 months since diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare and terminal tumor. Therefore, 
knowledge about its manifestations and effective treatment methods is lacking. 
Disseminative intravascular coagulopathy is a unique clinical characteristic of 
angiosarcoma seen in a subset of patients.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disease that leads to a specific 
collection of symptoms. Most patients over time develop cutaneous 
manifestations, which include neurofibromas, freckling, or even cafe-au-lait 
spots. In general, patients with NF1 have a shorter life expectancy than 
non-affected individuals. This report aims to present our patient with NF1 and 
one of its rare manifestations, neurofibromatosis with diffuse lung disease. 
Hopefully, by describing this case and our patient's condition, it will serve as 
a resource to those treating similar patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sintilimab is a selective PD-1 inhibitor with efficacy 
in advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
sintilimab + chemotherapy versus camrelizumab + chemotherapy as the first-line 
treatment for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC in Chinese 
patients. In addition, this study aimed to reveal the impact of the reference 
treatment choice on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) results.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model (PSM) with three health states was 
constructed in a 3-week cycle with a lifetime horizon from the Chinese 
healthcare system perspective. Anchored matching adjusted indirect comparison 
was used for survival analyses based on individual patient data from Orient-11. 
Sintilimab + chemotherapy was chosen as the reference treatments in scenarios 1 
and 2, while the camrelizumab + chemotherapy was chosen as the reference 
treatments in scenario 3. The utility values of different health states were 
derived from the patient-level European Organization for Research and Treatment 
Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores by mapping to the 
EQ-5D-5L, and QALYs were calculated as the health outcomes. One-way 
deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and probability sensitivity analysis 
(PSA) were performed to explore model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to camrelizumab + chemotherapy, sintilimab + chemotherapy was 
associated with higher effectiveness (incremental QALYs ranged from 0.13-0.62) 
and lower total costs (incremental costs ranged from $1,099-$5,201), resulting 
in an ICER ranging from $6,440-$8,454/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Sintilimab + chemotherapy is a cost-effective option compared with 
camrelizumab + chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for locally advanced or 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC in China.

We aim to report the latest incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex, sociodemographic index 
(SDI), and provide predictions to 2035. We use estimates from Global Burden of 
Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 to analyze the incidence, 
mortality, and DALYs. All the estimates were shown as counts and 
age-standardized rates (ASR). In 2019, there were more than 176,501 (156,046 to 
199,917) incidence cases, with ASRs of 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4). Nasopharyngeal cancer 
(NPC) accounted for 71,610 (65,442 to 77,625) deaths, with ASRs of 0.9 (0.8 to 
0.9). NPC was also responsible for 2.34 million (2,139,753 to 2,536,657) DALYs, 
with ASRs of 28.0 (25.7 to 30.4). The count of all the new cases increased from 
1990 to 2019. At the regional level, the highest age-standardized incidence 
rates were found in East Asia, the highest age-standardized death and DALY rates 
were shown in Southeast Asia. At the national level, the age-standardized 
incidence rates were highest in Singapore, and the age-standardized death and 
DALY rates were highest in Malaysia. The total numbers and rates of all the 
estimates were significantly higher among males than females across most of the 
age groups. The considerable burden of NPC was attributable to alcohol use, 
smoking, and occupational exposure to formaldehyde. A total of six GBD regions 
and 88 countries are projected to experience an increase in NPC ASRs between 
2019 and 2035, respectively. Despite the current decline in age-standardized 
mortality and DALY rates globally, the age-standardized incidence rate has 
increased from 1990 to 2019, and continues to increase between 2020 and 2035, 
indicating that nasopharyngeal cancer remains a major health challenge 
worldwide. Prevention strategies should focus on modifiable risk factors, 
especially among males in East Asia.

Rice-wheat rotation is one of the most intensive agricultural planting modes in 
China and is pivotal to develop optimized straw-returning management in situ to 
improve soil fertility and productivity in agricultural ecosystems. Previous 
studies have mainly focused on the effects of straw return with a single 
application of organic fertilizers. The integrated management of different 
fertilizers in improving the management of straw return in situ is not well 
known. In this study, a field experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 to 
explore the effects of a combined system of modified organic substrate (MOS) and 
straw-degrading compound microbial agent (CMA) on soil physiochemical 
properties, labile organic carbon, microbial activities, and soil microbial 
community composition under the background of direct crop straw return and 
chemical fertilizer utilization. Four treatments were designed: (1) control 
check; (2) CMA; (3) MOS; and (4) MOS + CMA. The results showed that 
the MOS + CMA treatment had the combined advantages of soil organic matter (SOM) 
accumulation, soil nutrient increase and soil microbial community alteration, 
which may be more suitable for improving the quality and fertility of sandy loam 
soil. This study provides novel insights for further understanding the effects 
of organic substrates and composite microbial agents on SOM changes and 
microbial community composition and function in the field, which has important 
implications for sustainable crop production and agricultural development.

BACKGROUND: Nursing homes in the United States were devastated by COVID-19, with 
710,000 cases and 138,000 deaths nationally through October 2021. Although 
facilities are required to have infection control staff, only 3% of designated 
infection preventionists have taken a basic infection control course prior to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Most research has focused on infection control in the 
acute care setting. However, little is known about the implementation of 
infection control practices and effective interventions in nursing homes. This 
study utilizes Project ECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes), an 
evidence-based telementoring model, to connect Penn State University subject 
matter experts with nursing home staff and administrators to proactively support 
evidence-based infection control guideline implementation.
OBJECTIVE: Our study seeks to answer the research question of how evidence-based 
infection control guidelines can be implemented effectively in nursing homes, 
including comparing the effectiveness of two ECHO-delivered training 
interventions on key patient-centered outcomes such as reducing the number of 
residents with a COVID-19 diagnosis.
METHODS: A stratified cluster randomized design was utilized. Using a 1:1 ratio, 
we randomly assigned 136 nursing homes to ECHO or ECHO Plus arms. Randomization 
was stratified by geographic location, baseline COVID-19 infection rate, and 
facility capacity. The study had two phases. In phase one, completed in July 
2021, nursing homes in both study arms received a 16-week infectious disease and 
quality improvement training intervention via real-time, interactive 
videoconferencing and the ECHO learning model. Phase one sessions were up to 90 
minutes in duration. In phase two, completed in November 2021, the ECHO group 
was offered optional 60-minute office hours for 9 weeks and the ECHO Plus group 
received 9 weeks of 60-minute sessions on emerging topics and an additional 
8-session refresher series on infection control.
RESULTS: A total of 290 nursing home facilities were assessed for eligibility, 
with 136 nursing homes recruited and randomly assigned to ECHO or ECHO Plus. 
Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance 
(RE-AIM) framework, we will simultaneously evaluate the study's effectiveness 
and implementation outcomes at baseline (intervention start date), and at 4, 6, 
12, and 18 months. The primary outcome is the COVID-19 infection rate in nursing 
homes. Secondary outcomes include COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, flu-like 
illness, and quality of life. Surveys and interviews with participants will also 
provide data as to the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of best 
practices taught throughout ECHO sessions.
CONCLUSIONS: A multipronged approach to improving infection control and 
emergency preparedness in nursing homes is important, given the toll that the 
COVID-19 pandemic has taken on residents and staff. The ECHO model has 
significant strengths when compared to traditional training, as it allows for 
remote learning delivered by a multidisciplinary team of experts, and utilizes 
case discussions that match the context and capacity of nursing homes.

INTRODUCTION: Morbidity is considered to be negligible in Leechavengvongs 
transfer (LT) of the long head of the triceps onto the axillary nerve, but the 
assessment methods used may lack reproducibility. We assessed triceps strength 
after LT objectively by the isokinetic technique, addressing the following 
questions: Is strength lowered after LT compared to the healthy limb? And 2) is 
there a good correlation between isokinetic dynamometry and subjective 
assessment?
HYPOTHESIS: Isokinetic measurement shows a decrease in triceps strength at peak 
torque after LT compared to the healthy limb, and this morbidity is 
underestimated on subjective assessment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients 
undergoing LT for axillary nerve trunk palsy between 2008 and 2020, with M5 
triceps preoperatively on the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) scale. 
Twenty patients, with a mean age of 25±9years (range, 15-48years) were assessed 
at a mean 58±47months (range, 6-174months). Elbow extension strength was 
assessed on a standardized questionnaire, BMRC isometric test and isokinetic 
test on an angular course of 90° at 60°/sec and 180°/sec concentrically and 
30°/sec excentrically.
RESULTS: Strength at 60°/sec and 180°/sec concentrically and 30°/sec 
excentrically was significantly lower than in the healthy limb: respectively, 
-17Nm, -15Nm, and -16Nm, (p<0.001) for a mean -23%. Loss of strength was mainly 
severe on isokinetic testing and mild on isometric testing. Seven patients 
reported contracture (35%), 12 fatigue (60%), and 3 weakness (15%). Satisfaction 
with extension strength was excellent or good for respectively 12 (60%) and 8 
patients (40%). Triceps strength was graded BMRC M4 in 9 triceps (11%) and M5 in 
11 (55%).
DISCUSSION: After LT, isokinetic measurement found generally severe loss of 
triceps strength, but without subjective impact on everyday life.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV; retrospective study.

BACKGROUND: The recently developed Screening Tool of Older Persons' 
Prescriptions in Frail adults with a limited life expectancy (STOPPFrail) 
criteria can be helpful for screening medications (PIMs), but it is yet to be 
widely used in clinical practice. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prevalence 
of PIMs based on the STOPPFrail criteria (STOPPFrail-PIM) among frail older 
adults with limited life expectancy admitted to the geriatric center.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in the 
geriatric center at an academic tertiary care hospital in Korea. We evaluated 
frail older adults with limited life expectancy who received comprehensive 
geriatric assessment (CGA) admitted between 1 January, 2019 and 30 June, 2020. 
Frail older adults with limited life expectancy were identified by geriatricians 
with retrospective records and the prevalence of STOPPFrail-PIMs was analysed by 
trained pharmacists. Descriptive analysis, t-test, and chi-square test were 
conducted using IBM SPSS software version 25.0.
RESULTS: Among 504 older adults who underwent CGA after admission, 171 frail 
older adults with limited life expectancy were identified by geriatricians and 
included in the study. An average of 11.3 ± 4.7 medications were administered 
regularly to each patient before admission. Overall, 97.1% (166/171) had at 
least one STOPPFrail-PIM, and the mean number of STOPPFrail-PIM was 4.2 ± 2.8. 
Drugs without clear clinical indication (A2) were the most frequent 
pre-admission STOPPFrail-PIM, followed by lipid-lowering therapies (B1) and 
neuroleptic antipsychotics (D1). The number of STOPPFrail-PIM was significantly 
lower at discharge than that at admission, with the decrease being the highest 
for A2 at 94.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Most frail older adults with limited life expectancy had at least 
one STOPPFrail-PIM at admission, and the rate of STOPPFrail-PIM decreased 
significantly at discharge after the geriatric multidisciplinary team care. 
Further studies are needed to investigate the association between the use of 
STOPPFrail-PIM and adverse consequences in frail older adults.

Class B1 of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprises 15 members activated 
by physiologically important peptide hormones. Among them, vasoactive intestinal 
polypeptide receptor 2 (VIP2R) is expressed in the central and peripheral 
nervous systems and involved in a number of pathophysiological conditions, 
including pulmonary arterial hypertension, autoimmune and psychiatric disorders, 
in which it is thus a valuable drug target. Here, we report the cryo-electron 
microscopy structure of the human VIP2R bound to its endogenous ligand PACAP27 
and the stimulatory G protein. Different from all reported peptide-bound class 
B1 GPCR structures, the N-terminal α-helix of VIP2R adopts a unique conformation 
that deeply inserts into a cleft between PACAP27 and the extracellular loop 1, 
thereby stabilizing the peptide-receptor interface. Its truncation or extension 
significantly decreased VIP2R-mediated cAMP accumulation. Our results provide 
additional information on peptide recognition and receptor activation among 
class B1 GPCRs and may facilitate the design of better therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: A broad range of scientific studies involve taking measurements on a 
circular, rather than linear, scale (often variables related to times or 
orientations). For linear measures there is a well-established statistical 
toolkit based on linear modelling to explore the associations between this focal 
variable and potentially several explanatory factors and covariates. In 
contrast, statistical testing of circular data is much simpler, often involving 
either testing whether variation in the focal measurements departs from circular 
uniformity, or whether a single explanatory factor with two levels is supported.
METHODS: We use simulations and example data sets to investigate the usefulness 
of a MANOVA approach for circular data in comparison to commonly used 
statistical tests.
RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that a MANOVA approach based on the sines and 
cosines of the circular data is as powerful as the most-commonly used tests when 
testing deviation from a uniform distribution, while additionally offering 
extension to multi-factorial modelling that these conventional 
circular statistical tests do not.
CONCLUSIONS: The herein presented MANOVA approach offers a substantial 
broadening of the scientific questions that can be addressed statistically using 
circular data.

Hospital Hamburg, Bergedorfer Straße 10, 21033 Hamburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Surgical therapy of bone metastases is becoming increasingly 
important due to prolonged life expectancy and improved oncological treatment 
options. In a mostly palliative approach, it is necessary to identify those 
patients who might benefit from surgery. The shorter the remaining lifetime, the 
more restricted the indication and the less radical the intervention should be. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative outcomes and prognostic 
factors for survival of patients with surgically treated bone metastases.
METHODS: We retrospectively included 140 patients who underwent surgery for 151 
bone metastases in the extremities and pelvis at our hospital between 2010 and 
2020. We examined patient demographics, surgical procedures, 30-day 
complications, local tumour progression, and reoperations. Survival was 
calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic factors were investigated by 
univariate analysis using the log-rank test and multivariate analysis using the 
Cox regression hazard model.
RESULTS: In 138 patients, the median survival time was 12.3 months. The overall 
survival rates at one, two, three and five years were 52.3%, 37.6%, 28.0%, and 
18.0%, respectively. In univariate analysis, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, 
pathological fracture, visceral metastasis and multiple bone metastases were 
significantly associated with prognosis. No significant influence was determined 
for gender, age, location of bone metastasis, type of surgical procedure and 
time between diagnosis of primary tumour and surgery for bone metastasis. 
Multivariate analysis confirmed that pathological fracture, visceral metastasis 
and lung cancer were negative prognostic variables in terms of survival. Within 
30 days, the incidence of complications was 25.0% and mortality was 9.3%. The 
most common complications were urinary tract infections (5.0%), pneumonia 
(4.3%), and delirium (2.9%). Local tumour progression occurred in 12 patients 
(8.7%) and five reoperations (3.6%) were performed. There were no significant 
differences between patients treated with endoprosthetic replacement (n = 47) 
and those treated with internal fixation (n = 91) in terms of 30-day 
complications and mortality as well as local tumour progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients after surgery for bone metastases in the 
extremities or pelvis is very limited. The presence of a pathological fracture, 
visceral metastasis and lung cancer were independent prognostic factors for poor 
survival. Both internal fixation and endoprosthetic replacement achieved similar 
outcomes.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), sometimes known as myositis 
ossificans progressiva, is an ultra-rare disease in which bone is formed in 
muscular tissue, tendons and ligaments. This is known as heterotopic 
ossification (HO). FOP is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the highly 
conserved ACVR1/ALK2 gene which affects about 1 in 1.5-2 million individuals. At 
birth, patients with the predominant R206H mutation only exhibit a bilateral 
hallux valgus. During childhood, heterotopic bone formation develops in a 
typical pattern, affecting the axial muscles first before appendicular body 
parts are involved. HO can start spontaneously but is often elicited by soft 
tissue trauma or medical procedures. After soft tissue injury, an inflammatory 
process called a flare-up can start, followed by the formation of HO. HO leads 
to a limited range of motion, culminating in complete ankylosis of nearly all 
joints. As a result of HO surrounding the thorax, patients often suffer from 
thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS). TIS is the most common cause of a limited 
life expectancy for FOP patients, with a median life expectancy of 56 years. 
Management is focused on preventing soft-tissue injury that can provoke 
flare-ups. This includes prevention of iatrogenic damage by biopsies, 
intramuscular injections and surgery. Anti-inflammatory medication is often 
started when a flare-up occurs but has a poor basis of evidence. Several forms 
of potential treatment for FOP are being researched in clinical trials. 
Progression of the disease is monitored using CT and 18F-NaF PET/CT combined 
with functional assessments. Patients are regularly evaluated for frequently 
occurring complications such as restrictive lung disease. Here, we review the 
current management, monitoring and treatment of FOP.

Different methods for chlorophyll removal were used for betel leaf ethanolic 
extracts (BLEE). Chlorophyll content, color, and antioxidant and antibacterial 
activities of the resulting extracts were examined. Sedimentation process 
remarkably reduced the chlorophyll content and color of BLEE (p < 0.05), while 
antioxidant and antibacterial activities were enhanced (p < 0.05). Polyphenol 
content and bioactivities of the extracts dechlorophyllized using organic 
solvents varied (p < 0.05). Antibacterial efficacy of BLEE dechlorophyllized by 
the sedimentation method (BLEE-SED) depended on concentrations. Lower minimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 
BLEE-SED toward 4 bacteria were obtained, compared to other extracts. Lower 
microbiological and chemical changes were achieved when Nile tilapia fillets 
were treated with BLEE-SED at 400 and 600 ppm after 12 days of storage at 4 °C. 
Therefore, sedimentation as a green process could be adopted for preparing a 
safe BLEE with augmented bioactivities and pale color, which could extend 
shelf-life of refrigerated Nile tilapia fillets.
