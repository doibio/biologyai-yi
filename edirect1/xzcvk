BACKGROUND: Although migrant health is a topic of interest across Europe and 
although health care services in Germany consider migrant health issues, people 
with a migrant background often experience difficulties regarding health care 
provision. The prevalence of various cancers among migrants is lower relative to 
non-migrants although this equalizes with increasing duration of residence. 
There are documented differences in health behavior and disease-coping 
strategies between migrants and non-migrants, but data are scarce on this 
subject. This analysis investigates the extent of information migrant and 
non-migrant colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in Germany want about their life 
expectancy and the level of trust they have in their treating physician.
METHOD: Data from 522 CRC patients were collected through a self-reported 
questionnaire. Migrant background was determined by the patients' and/or their 
parents' birthplace. Bivariate analyses were applied to determine the 
differences between migrants and non-migrants. A multivariate analysis was used 
to measure the effect of migration background, demographics, and cancer stage 
and treatment on the preferred extent of information about life expectancy and 
trust in their treating physician.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences regarding demographics or cancer 
stage and treatment between migrant and non-migrant CRC patients. Having a 
migrant background had no influence on the level of trust in the treating 
physician, but migrants preferred to be less informed about their life 
expectancy than non-migrants (21.4% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.04). The multivariate 
analysis showed that men (aOR = 2.102, CI: 1.123-3.932) and patients with a 
non-migrant background (aOR = 5.03, CI: 1.02-24.73) preferred receiving 
information about the approximate value of their life expectancy, rather than 
receiving no information.
CONCLUSION: The study found more similarities than discrepancies between migrant 
and non-migrant CRC patients regarding demographic factors and stage of disease 
and treatment, which may be a consequence of an increasingly homogeneous 
cross-cultural society. However, cultural differences between the minority and 
host population remain and should always be taken into account in daily clinical 
practice and in the communication skills training of health care professionals. 
The study also indicates that recording migration background into health 
registers would facilitate migrant-sensitive research.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive solid tumor. HCC 
occurred at younger and elder ages were considered driven by different oncogenic 
mechanisms, and they demonstrated distinct clinical courses.
METHODS: A total of 382 HCC patients treated by surgical resections was 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A univariate-multivariate analysis showed that viral etiology (chronic 
hepatitis B, C) and the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B28 
(UGT2B28) genomic variant rs2132039 were independently associated with the age 
at presentation of HCC (all adjusted P < 0.05). An extensive evaluations of 
clinicalpathological factors showed that the age (Odds ratio [OR], 1.016; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.032; adjusted P = 0.037) and ascites (OR, 
3.505; CI, 1.358-9.048; adjusted P = 0.010) were two independent factors 
associated with this genomic variant. The age was 54.1 ± 14.6 years for patients 
with the "TT" variant type, and 58.2 ± 13.7 years for those with the "Non-TT" 
variant type. The age disparity was most prominent in alcoholic patients (OR, 
1.079; CI, 1.035-1.125; P < 0.001, age of "TT", 49.6 ± 12.2; age of "non-TT", 
59.3 ± 10.7). This genomic variant was also associated with age of recurrence 
(P = 0.025), distant metastasis (P = 0.024) and HCC-related death (P = 0.008) in 
non-censored patients.
CONCLUSIONS: An UGT2B28 genomic variant was indicative of the age of HCC 
presentation, recurrence, distant metastasis and death.

Pancreas cancer is a complex disease and its prognosis is related to the origin 
of the tumor cell as well as the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. 
Pancreatic adenocarcinomas derive from the exocrine pancreas and are the fourth 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, while 
well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) derived from the 
endocrine part of the pancreas are rare and characterized by a slow growth and 
good life expectancy. Surgery is the only curative treatment approach, and an 
accurate assessment of resectability is of paramount importance in order to 
avoid futile procedures. The role of molecular imaging with positron emission 
tomography and computed tomography ranges from indispensable for pNETs to 
controversial for certain scenarios in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. This review 
article aims to overview molecular pancreatic imaging.

BACKGROUND: The lack of seasonality in influenza epidemics in the tropics makes 
the application of well-established temperate zone national vaccination plans 
challenging.
OBJECTIVES: We developed an individual-based simulation model to study optimal 
vaccination scheduling and assess cost-effectiveness of these vaccination 
schedules in scenarios of no influenza seasonality and the seasonality regimes 
of Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo.
METHODS: The simulation models heterogeneities in human contact networks, levels 
of protective antibodies following infection, the effectiveness of the influenza 
vaccine, and seasonality. Using a no intervention baseline, we consider 3 
alternative vaccination strategies: (1) annual vaccination for a percentage of 
the elderly, (2) biannual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, and (3) 
annual vaccination for all elderly and a fraction of the remaining population. 
We considered 5 vaccination uptake rates for each strategy and modeled the 
estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs), indicating the cost-effectiveness of each scenario.
RESULTS: In Singapore, annual vaccination for a proportion of elderly is largely 
cost-effective. However, with fixed uptake rates, partial biannual vaccination 
for the elderly yields a higher ICER than partial annual vaccination for the 
elderly, resulting in a cost-ineffective ICER. The most optimal strategy is the 
total vaccination of all the elderly and a proportion of individuals from other 
age groups, which results in a cost-saving ICER. This finding is consistent 
across different seasonality regimes.
CONCLUSIONS: Tropical countries like Singapore can have comparably 
cost-effective vaccination strategies as found in countries with winter 
epidemics. The vaccination of all the elderly and a proportion of other age 
groups is the most cost-effective strategy, supporting the need for an extensive 
national influenza vaccination program.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients receive bare metal stents instead of drug-eluting 
stents (DES) to shorten the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). The 
SENIOR trial compared outcomes between these 2 types of stents combined with a 
short duration of DAPT. A significant decrease in the number of patients with at 
least 1 major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) was noted in the 
DES group.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article was to perform an economic evaluation 
of the SENIOR trial.
METHODS: This evaluation was performed separately in 5 participating countries 
using pooled patient-level data from all study patients and country-specific 
unit costs and utility values. Costs, MACCEs, and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were calculated in both arms at 1 year, and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated. Uncertainty was explored by 
probabilistic bootstrapping.
RESULTS: A total of 1200 patients underwent randomization. The average total 
cost per patient was higher in the DES group. The number of MACCEs and average 
QALYs were not statistically different between the 2 groups. The 1-year 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each country of reference ranged from 
€13 752 to €20 511/MACCE avoided and from €42 835 to €68 231/QALY gained. The 
scatter plots found a wide dispersion, reflecting a large uncertainty 
surrounding the results. But in each country studied, 90% of the bootstrap 
replications indicated a higher cost for greater effectiveness for the DES 
group. Assuming a willingness to pay of €50 000/QALY, there was between a 40% 
and 50% chance that the use of DES was cost-effective in 4 countries.
CONCLUSION: The use of DES instead of bare metal stents combined with a short 
duration of DAPT in elderly patients induced higher cost for greater 
effectiveness in each of the 5 countries studied.

BACKGROUND: Blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment (AHT) generally 
increase with age, but there is uncertainty concerning the value of treatment at 
very advanced ages.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of AHT in people aged 80 years 
and older.
METHODS: A Markov model compared AHT with no blood pressure treatment for 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Outcomes were new stroke, coronary heart 
disease, and diabetes, with falls included as a potential complication of AHT. 
Costs were evaluated from a health system perspective. Incidence, mortality, and 
costs of healthcare utilization were estimated from linked primary and secondary 
care electronic health records for 98 220 individuals aged 80 years and older. 
Clinical effectiveness estimates were from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly 
Trial. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the base case, AHT was associated with an additional 725 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and £4.3 million per 1000, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £5977 per QALY. The ICER was most 
sensitive to the cost of falls and relative risk reduction in stroke incidence. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis gave 95% uncertainty intervals: £5057 to 
£8398 per QALY in men and £4955 to £8218 per QALY in women. AHT for secondary 
prevention in participants with coronary heart disease gave an ICER of £9903 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: AHT is estimated to be cost-effective in individuals aged 80 years 
and older, even if health benefits are smaller or side effects costlier than in 
the base case. Benefits and harms for vulnerable subgroups require further 
evaluation.

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, medical treatment for cancer has improved, 
thereby increasing the life expectancy of patients with cancer. Hence, the focus 
in healthcare shifted towards analysing treatments that offer to decrease 
distress and improve the quality of life of patients with cancer. The 
psychological burden of patients with cancer originates from all kinds of 
psychosocial challenges related to diagnosis and treatment. Cancer counselling 
centres (CCounCs) try to address these concerns. However, the current literature 
lacks research on the effectiveness of CCounCs. This study aims to assess the 
effectiveness of CCounCs with regard to distress and other relevant psychosocial 
variables (quality of life, anxietyand so on).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective observational study with a non-randomised 
control group has three measurement points: before the first counselling session 
(baseline, t0) and at 2 weeks and 3 months after baseline (t1, t2). Patients and 
their relatives who seek counselling between December 2018 and November 2020 and 
have sufficient German language skills will be included. The control group will 
be recruited at clinics and oncological outpatient centres in Hamburg. 
Propensity scoring will be applied to adjust for differences between the control 
and intervention groups at baseline. Sociodemographic data, medical data and 
counselling concerns are measured at baseline. Distress (distress thermometer), 
quality of life (Short Form-8 Health Survey, European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30), anxiety 
(Generalized AnxietyDisorder-7), depression (Patient HealthQuestionnaire-9) and 
further psychosocial variables are assessed at all time points. With a total of 
787 participants, differences between the intervention and control groups of a 
small effect size (f=0.10) can be detected with a power of 80%.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was registered prior to data collection with 
the German Registration of Clinical Trials in September 2018. Ethical approval 
was received by the local psychological ethical committee of the Center for 
Psychosocial Medicine at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf in 
August 2018. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is 
commonly found in glioblastoma (GBM). About 57% GBM overexpresses EGFR and are 
associated with tumor progression, poor prognosis, and shorter life expectancy. 
Molecular profiling of solid tumors usually takes several weeks and may be 
biased by intrinsic tumor heterogeneity.
METHODS: The unique sequence created by the fusion of exon 1 and exon 8 in 
EGFRvIII was used to guide the design of primers and a Minor Groove Binder (MGB) 
probe. Extracted total RNA was reverse transcribed and pre-amplified by PCR, 
followed by detection of the EGFRvIII mutation by dPCR.
RESULTS: The lowest limit of quantification of our EGFRvIII assay was 0.003%. 
The EGFRvIII variant was identified in patient-derived glioma neurosphere cell 
lines, xenograft mouse model, and patient-derived tumor specimens. The overall 
workflow can be accomplished within 24 hours. In certain samples, EGFRvIII was 
detected when next-generation sequencing was unable to identify the variant. 
This finding highlights the ability of the dPCR assay to identify EGFRvIII 
mutations in heterogeneous solid tumors such as GBM in a rapid fashion by 
profiling samples from spatially distinct areas of tumors from the same patient.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a highly sensitive digital PCR (dPCR) 
platform and leveraged our assay to detect the variant III alteration of EGFR 
(EGFRvIII) and amplified EGFR in patient-derived glioma neurosphere cell lines, 
orthotopic xenograft GBM mouse models, and patient-derived tumor specimens in 
less than 24 hours from minute quantities of starting material.

AIMS: In the COMPASS trial, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily (bid) plus 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg once daily (od) performed better than ASA 
100 mg od alone in reducing the rate of cardiovascular disease, stroke, or 
myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 
peripheral artery disease (PAD). A Markov model was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban plus ASA vs. ASA alone over a lifetime 
horizon, from the UK National Health System perspective.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The base case analysis assumed that patients entered the 
model in the event-free health state, with the possibility to experience ≤2 
events, transitioning every three-month cycle, through acute and post-acute 
health states of MI, ischaemic stroke (IS), or intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), 
and death. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life years-all discounted 
at 3.5%-and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, as well as 
scenario analyses. In the model, patients on rivaroxaban plus ASA lived for an 
average of 14.0 years with no IS/MI/ICH, and gained 9.7 QALYs at a cost of 
£13 947, while those receiving ASA alone lived for an average of 12.7 years and 
gained 9.3 QALYs at a cost of £8126. The ICER was £16 360 per QALY. This 
treatment was cost-effective in 98% of 5000 iterations at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £30 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: This Markov model suggests that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus ASA is a 
cost-effective alternative to ASA alone in patients with chronic CAD or PAD.

INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need for well-tolerated antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs) that effectively control focal onset seizures. This study aimed to 
evaluate the economic value of new AEDs in the treatment of focal onset seizure, 
with or without secondary generalization, in Finnish adults and adolescents with 
epilepsy, comparing brivaracetam with perampanel as adjunctive AEDs.
METHODS: Economic value was assessed using cost-utility analysis. Periods of AED 
initiation, titration, response assessment (seizure freedom, ≥ 50% reduction, no 
response), switching in no response or treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), and death were simulated using a discrete-event simulation model. 
Responses and switching were simulated based on a comprehensive Bayesian network 
meta-analysis. The primary modeled outcome was the 3%/year discounted 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Discounted quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), payer costs (year 2017 Euro) per patient, and net monetary 
benefit (NMB) were secondary outcomes. Probabilistic and comprehensive 
deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Brivaracetam was more efficacious and had fewer TEAEs than perampanel 
and other AEDs. Modeled average 5-year QALYs and costs were 3.671 and €28,297 
for brivaracetam and 3.611 and €27,979 for perampanel, respectively. The 
resulting ICER for brivaracetam versus perampanel was only €5345/QALY gained in 
a deterministic base case scenario. Brivaracetam had a positive NMB and high 
probability of cost-effectiveness of €1190 and 71% or €1944 and 80% with the 
assumed willingness to pay of €25,358 or €38,036/QALY gained, respectively. The 
primary result was robust, with a positive NMB persistent in all sensitivity 
analysis scenarios. When switching from brivaracetam to perampanel was excluded 
from the modeling or switching from perampanel to brivaracetam was included, 
brivaracetam was cost-saving and more effective than perampanel (dominant).
CONCLUSION: These simulated comparisons demonstrated that brivaracetam was more 
effective and potentially also more affordable than perampanel. Thus, 
brivaracetam is likely a cost-effective and net beneficial alternative to 
perampanel for treatment of focal onset seizures. Plain language summary

Range expansion results from complex eco-evolutionary processes where range 
dynamics and niche shifts interact in a novel physical space and/or environment, 
with scale playing a major role. Obligate symbionts (i.e. organisms permanently 
living on hosts) differ from free-living organisms in that they depend on strong 
biotic interactions with their hosts which alter their niche and spatial 
dynamics. A symbiotic lifestyle modifies organism-environment relationships 
across levels of organisation, from individuals to geographical ranges. These 
changes influence how symbionts experience colonisation and, by extension, range 
expansion. Here, we investigate the potential implications of a symbiotic 
lifestyle on range expansion capacity. We present a unified conceptual overview 
on range expansion of symbionts that integrates concepts grounded in niche and 
metapopulation theories. Overall, we explain how niche-driven and 
dispersal-driven processes govern symbiont range dynamics through their 
interaction across scales, from host switching to geographical range shifts. 
First, we describe a background framework for range dynamics based on 
metapopulation concepts applied to symbiont organisation levels. Then, we 
integrate metapopulation processes operating in the physical space with niche 
dynamics grounded in the environmental arena. For this purpose, we provide a 
definition of the biotope (i.e. living place) specific to symbionts as a hinge 
concept to link the physical and environmental spaces, wherein the biotope unit 
is a metapopulation patch (either a host individual or a land fragment). 
Further, we highlight the dual nature of the symbionts' niche, which is 
characterised by both host traits and the external environment, and define 
proper conceptual variants to provide a meaningful unification of niche, biotope 
and symbiont organisation levels. We also explore variation across systems in 
the relative relevance of both external environment and host traits to the 
symbiont's niche and their potential implications on range expansion. We 
describe in detail the potential mechanisms by which hosts, through their 
function as biotopes, could influence how some symbionts expand their range - 
depending on the life history and traits of both associates. From the spatial 
point of view, hosts can extend symbiont dispersal range via host-mediated 
dispersal, although the requirement for among-host dispersal can challenge 
symbiont range expansion. From the niche point of view, homeostatic properties 
of host bodies may allow symbiont populations to become insensitive to off-host 
environmental gradients during host-mediated dispersal. These two potential 
benefits of the symbiont-host interaction can enhance symbiont range expansion 
capacity. On the other hand, the central role of hosts governing the symbiont 
niche makes symbionts strongly dependent on the availability of suitable hosts. 
Thus, environmental, dispersal and biotic barriers faced by suitable hosts apply 
also to the symbiont, unless eventual opportunities for host switching allow the 
symbiont to expand its repertoire of suitable hosts (thus expanding its 
fundamental niche). Finally, symbionts can also improve their range expansion 
capacity through their impacts on hosts, via protecting their affiliated hosts 
from environmental harshness through biotic facilitation.

OBJECTIVES: Reproductive suppression refers to, among other phenomena, the 
termination of pregnancies in populations exposed to signals of death among 
young conspecifics. Extending the logic of reproduction suppression to humans 
has implications for health including that populations exposed to it should 
exhibit relatively great longevity. No research, however, has tested this 
prediction.
METHODS: We apply time-series methods to vital statistics from Sweden for the 
years 1751 through 1800 to test if birth cohorts exposed in utero to 
reproductive suppression exhibited lifespan different from expected. We use the 
odds of death among Swedes age 1 to 9 years to gauge exposure. As the dependent 
variable, we use cohort life expectancy. Our methods ensure autocorrelation 
cannot spuriously induce associations nor reduce the efficiency of our 
estimates.
RESULTS: Our findings imply that reproductive suppression increased the lifespan 
of 24 annual birth cohorts by at least 1.3 years over the 50-year test period, 
and that 12 of those cohorts exhibited increases of at least 1.7 years above 
expected.
CONCLUSIONS: The best available data in which to search for evidence of 
reproductive suppression in humans support the argument that populations 
subjected to environments dangerous for children yield birth cohorts that 
exhibit unexpectedly great longevity.

IMPORTANCE: Radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) is a common, often debilitating, 
adverse effect of radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer. 
Quality of life can be severely affected, and current treatments have limited 
benefit.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if acupuncture can prevent RIX in patients with head and 
neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 2-center, phase 3, randomized clinical 
trial compared a standard care control (SCC) with true acupuncture (TA) and sham 
acupuncture (SA) among patients with oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
who were undergoing radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer centers in the 
United States and China. Patients were enrolled between December 16, 2011, and 
July 7, 2015. Final follow-up was August 15, 2016. Analyses were conducted 
February 1 through 28, 2019.
INTERVENTION: Either TA or SA using a validated acupuncture placebo device was 
performed 3 times per week during a 6- to 7-week course of radiation therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was RIX, as determined by the 
Xerostomia Questionnaire in which a higher score indicates worse RIX, for 
combined institutions 1 year after radiation therapy ended. Secondary outcomes 
included incidence of clinically significant xerostomia (score >30), salivary 
flow, quality of life, salivary constituents, and role of baseline expectancy 
related to acupuncture on outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 399 patients randomized, 339 were included in the final analysis 
(mean [SD] age, 51.3 [11.7] years; age range, 21-79 years; 258 [77.6%] men), 
including 112 patients in the TA group, 115 patients in the SA group, and 112 
patients in the SCC group. For the primary aim, the adjusted least square mean 
(SD) xerostomia score in the TA group (26.6 [17.7]) was significantly lower than 
in the SCC group (34.8 [18.7]) (P = .001; effect size = -0.44) and marginally 
lower but not statistically significant different from the SA group (31.3 
[18.6]) (P = .06; effect size = -0.26). Incidence of clinically significant 
xerostomia 1 year after radiation therapy ended followed a similar pattern, with 
38 patients in the TA group (34.6%), 54 patients in the SA group (47.8%), and 60 
patients in the SCC group (55.1%) experiencing clinically significant xerostomia 
(P = .009). Post hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between the 
TA and SCC groups at both institutions, but TA was significantly different from 
SA only at Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai, China (estimated difference 
[SE]: TA vs SCC, -9.9 [2.5]; P < .001; SA vs SCC, -1.7 [2.5]; P = .50; TA vs SA, 
-8.2 [2.5]; P = .001), and SA was significantly different from SCC only at the 
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (estimated 
difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -8.1 [3.4]; P = .016; SA vs SCC, -10.5 [3.3]; 
P = .002; TA vs SA, 2.4 [3.2]; P = .45).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that TA resulted 
in significantly fewer and less severe RIX symptoms 1 year after treatment vs 
SCC. However, further studies are needed to confirm clinical relevance and 
generalizability of this finding and to evaluate inconsistencies in response to 
sham acupuncture between patients in the United States and China.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is among the most common genetic diseases in the 
United States, affecting approximately 100,000 people. In the United States, SCD 
is characterized by a shortened life expectancy of only about 50 years in severe 
subtypes, significant quality-of-life impairments, and increased healthcare 
utilization and spending. SCD is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, 
vaso-occlusion, and progressive vascular injury affecting multiple organ 
systems. The pathophysiology is directly related to polymerization of 
deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to a cascade of pathologic events including 
erythrocyte sickling, vaso-occlusion, tissue ischemia, and reperfusion injury as 
well as hemolysis, abnormal activation of inflammatory and oxidative pathways, 
endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and activation of 
coagulation pathways. These multifactorial abnormalities have both acute and 
chronic clinical consequences across multiple organ systems, including acute 
pain episodes, chronic pain syndromes, acute chest syndrome, anemia, stroke and 
silent cerebral infarcts, cognitive dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and a 
wide range of other clinical consequences. Hydroxyurea was the only approved 
treatment for SCD for nearly 2 decades; in 2017, L-glutamine oral powder was 
approved for the prevention of the acute complications of SCD. During the last 
several years there has been a dramatic increase in research into treatments 
that address distinct elements of SCD pathophysiology and even new curative 
approaches that provide new hope to patients and physicians for a clinically 
consequential disease that has long been neglected.

Neer Type-II Distal Clavicle Fractures: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of 
Fixation Techniques.

Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.

BACKGROUND: Neer type-II distal clavicle fractures are unstable and are 
generally appropriately managed with operative fixation. Fixation options 
include locking plates, hook plates, and suture button devices. No consensus on 
optimal technique exists.
METHODS: A decision tree model was created describing fixation of Neer type-II 
fractures using hook plates, locking plates, or suture buttons. Outcomes 
included uneventful healing, symptomatic implant removal, deep infection 
requiring debridement, and nonunion requiring revision. Weighted averages 
derived from a systematic review were used for probabilities. Cost-effectiveness 
was evaluated by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The 
ICER is defined as the ratio of the difference in cost and difference in 
effectiveness of each strategy, and is measured in cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY). The model was evaluated using thresholds of $50,000/QALY and 
$100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all outcome probabilities 
for each fixation strategy to assess cost-effectiveness across a range of 
values.
RESULTS: Forty-three papers met final inclusion criteria. Using suture buttons 
as the reference case in the health-care cost model, suture button repair was 
dominant (both less expensive and clinically superior). Hook plates cost 
substantially more ($5,360.52) compared with suture buttons and locking plates 
($3,713.50 and $4,007.44, respectively). Suture buttons and locking plates 
yielded similar clinical outcomes (0.92 and 0.91 QALY, respectively). Suture 
button dominance persisted in the societal perspective model. Sensitivity 
analysis on outcome probabilities showed that locking plates became the most 
cost-effective strategy if the revision rate after their use was lowered to 
2.2%, from the overall average in the sources of >19%. No other changes in 
outcome probabilities for any of the 3 techniques allowed suture buttons to be 
surpassed as the most cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of suture buttons is driven by low revision 
rates and high uneventful healing rates. Similar QALY values for locking plate 
and suture button fixation were observed, which is consistent with existing 
literature that has failed to identify either as the clinically superior 
technique. Cost-effectiveness should fit prominently into the decision-making 
rubric for these injuries.

The burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is considerable-approximately 1.8 million 
people are diagnosed each year with CRC and of these about half will succumb to 
the disease. In the case of CRC, there is strong evidence that an early 
diagnosis leads to a better prognosis, with metastatic CRC having a 5-year 
survival that is only slightly greater than 10% compared with up to 90% for 
stage I CRC. Clearly, biomarkers for the early detection of CRC would have a 
major clinical impact. We implemented a coherent gel-based proteomics biomarker 
discovery platform for the identification of clinically useful biomarkers for 
the early detection of CRC. Potential protein biomarkers were identified by a 2D 
gel-based analysis of a cohort composed of 128 CRC and site-matched normal 
tissue biopsies. Potential biomarkers were prioritized and assays to 
quantitatively measure plasma expression of the candidate biomarkers were 
developed. Those biomarkers that fulfilled the preset criteria for technical 
validity were validated in a case-control set of plasma samples, including 70 
patients with CRC, adenomas, or non-cancer diseases and healthy individuals in 
each group. We identified 63 consistently upregulated polypeptides (factor of 
four-fold or more) in our proteomics analysis. We selected 10 out of these 63 
upregulated polypeptides, and established assays to measure the concentration of 
each one of the ten biomarkers in plasma samples. Biomarker levels were analyzed 
in plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with adenomas, CRC 
patients, and patients with non-cancer diseases and we identified one protein, 
tropomyosin 3 (Tpm3) that could discriminate CRC at a significant level (p = 
0.0146). Our results suggest that at least one of the identified proteins, Tpm3, 
could be used as a biomarker in the early detection of CRC, and further studies 
should provide unequivocal evidence for the real-life clinical validity and 
usefulness of Tpm3.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: On account of the high prevalence of cardiovascular 
disease in patients with kidney failure, clinical practice guidelines recommend 
regular screening for asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients on 
the kidney transplant waitlist. To date, the cost-effectiveness of such 
screening has not been evaluated. A Canadian-Australasian randomized controlled 
trial of screening kidney transplant candidates for CAD (CARSK) is currently is 
being conducted to answer this question. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to 
determine, before completion of the trial, the cost-effectiveness of no further 
screening versus regular screening for asymptomatic CAD and to evaluate 
potential influential variables that may affect results of the economic 
evaluation.
STUDY DESIGN: A modeled cost-utility analysis.
SETTING & POPULATION: A theoretical cohort of adult Australian and New Zealand 
kidney transplant candidates on the waitlist.
INTERVENTION: No further screening for asymptomatic CAD versus regular 
protocolized screening (annual or second yearly) for CAD after kidney transplant 
waitlisting.
OUTCOMES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, reported as cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
MODEL, PERSPECTIVES, & TIMEFRAME: Markov microsimulation model, health system 
perspective and over a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of no 
further screening was $11,122 per QALY gained when compared with regular 
screening. No further screening increased survival by 0.49 life-year or 0.35 
QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses identified the costs of transplantation in 
the first year and CAD prevalence as the most influential variables. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that 94% of the simulations were 
cost-effective below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: Rates of cardiovascular events in waitlisted candidates and 
transplant recipients are limited in the contemporary era. The results may not 
be generalizable to populations outside Australia and New Zealand.
CONCLUSIONS: No further screening for CAD after waitlisting is likely to be 
cost-effective and may improve survival. Precision around CAD prevalence 
estimates and health care resource use will reduce existing uncertainty.

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have a growing life expectancy in the US due 
to early provision of effective antiretroviral treatment. This has resulted in 
increasing exposure to age-related chronic illness that may be exacerbated by 
HIV/AIDS or antiretroviral treatment. Prior work has suggested that PLWHA may be 
subject to accelerated aging, with earlier onset and higher risk of acquiring 
many chronic illnesses. However, the magnitude of these effects, controlling for 
chronic co-morbidities, has not been fully quantified. We evaluate the magnitude 
of association of HIV infection on developing chronic conditions while 
controlling for demographics, behavioral risk factors, and chronic 
comorbidities. We compare chronic disease risks of diabetes, hypertension, 
stroke, cancers, lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive 
impairment between PLWHA and HIV- individuals in a large, de-identified private 
insurance claims dataset (~24,000 PLWHA) using logistic regressions. HIV status 
is statistically significantly associated with higher levels for all chronic 
illnesses examined, a result which is robust to multiple model specifications 
and duration of analysis (2, 5, and 10 years from enrollment). Our results 
suggest that PLWHA may be at elevated risk for a wide variety of chronic 
illnesses and may require additional care as the aging PLWHA population grows.
