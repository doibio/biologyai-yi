CONCLUSIÓN: Dado que el indicador establecido por la OMS para la mortalidad 
prematura por enfermedades no transmisibles es predictivo de la mortalidad por 
enfermedades no transmisibles en las personas de edad, el indicador no debe 
interpretarse como un indicador de la edad. Será apropiado centrar los recursos 
en la medición de la mortalidad prematura por enfermedades no transmisibles, en 
particular en los entornos en los que no existe un registro universal de 
defunciones civiles. Este enfoque no debe perjudicar la prestación de servicios 
sanitarios a lo largo de toda la vida.

Publisher: الغرض: التحقق مما إذا كان المقياس الرئيسي لرصد التقدم المحرز نحو 
تحقيق هدف التنمية المستدامة 3.4، والذي يقيس نسبة الوفيات المبكرة الناجمة عن 
الأمراض غير المعدية هو السن (الوفيات بين الأشخاص الذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 30 و69 
عاماً).
الطريقة: لفحص العلاقة بين نسبة الوفيات المبكرة الناجمة عن الأمراض غير المعدية، 
ونسبة الوفيات الناجمة عن الأمراض غير المعدية لدى الأشخاص الأكبر سناً، تم تجميع 
قاعدة بيانات لمعدلات الوفيات الناتجة عن أمراض القلب والأوعية الدموية، والسرطان، 
ومرض الانسداد الرئوي المزمن، والسكري لدى الأشخاص الذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 30 و69 
عاماً، والأشخاص بين 70 و89 عاماً، وذلك باستخدام تقديرات من دراسة العبء العالمي 
للأمراض سنة 2017. وشملت البيانات 195 دولة، وست نقاط زمنية، وكلا الجنسين، بما 
يمثل 2340 حالة. تم تطبيق طريقة جدول الحياة، التابع لمنظمة الصحة العالمية (WHO)، 
لقياس نسبة الوفيات الناجمة عن الأمراض غير المعدية، على البيانات.
النتائج: كان هناك علاقة قوية بين أنماط الوفيات الناجمة عن الأمراض غير المعدية في 
المجموعتين المبكرة والمتقدمة في السن، مما يشير إلى أن قياس الوفيات المبكرة 
للأمراض غير السارية يقدم معلومات عن مثل هذه الوفيات في وقت لاحق من الحياة. لم 
يكن للوقت ولا للموقع الجغرافي تأثير ملموس على هذه العلاقة. ومع ذلك، كان هناك 
اختلافات بين الإناث والذكور في احتمالات الوفاة المرتبطة بسن محدد، وذلك بسبب 
الأمراض غير المعدية، مما يعني أن الوفيات الناتجة عن هذا المرض غير المعدي يجب 
تقييمها باستخدام نهج يعتمد على الجنس.
الاستنتاج: نظراً لأن مقياس منظمة الصحة العالمية المتبع للوفيات المبكرة الناتجة 
عن الأمراض غير المعدية كان متوقعاً لوفيات الأمراض غير المعدية لدى الأشخاص الأكبر 
سناً، فإنه لا يجب أن يُفسر المقياس على أنه يعتمد على السن. إن تركيز الموارد على 
قياس نسبة الوفيات المبكرة الناجمة عن الأمراض غير المعدية، سيكون مناسباً، وبخاصةً 
في البيئات التي لا يوجد فيها تسجيل مدني شامل للوفيات. يجب ألا يخل هذا النهج 
بتوفير الخدمات الصحية طوال فترة الحياة.

Publisher: 目的: 旨在探讨监测实现可持续发展目标的 3.4 指标，即测量非传染性疾病过早死亡率（30-69 岁人群的死亡率）是否存在年龄歧视。.
方法: 
为了研究非传染性疾病过早死亡率与老年人非传染性疾病死亡率之间的关联性，我们根据《2017 年全球疾病负担研究》中的预测，建立了针对 30-69 岁人群与 70-89 岁人群的心血管疾病、癌症、慢性阻塞性肺病和糖尿病死亡率的数据库。这些数据涵盖了 195 个国家、6 个时间点的男性和女性，提供了 2340 个实例。针对非传染性疾病过早死亡率的世卫组织寿命表法被应用于此类数据。.
结果: 
非传染性疾病过早死亡率和老年人的非传染性疾病死亡率模式之间关联性强，这表明测量非传染性疾病过早死亡率可以提供晚年非传染性疾病死亡率的信息。时间或地理位置不会对此关联性产生实质性的影响。然而，特定年龄段的非传染性疾病死亡率存在男女差异，这意味着应采用区分性别的方法评估非传染性疾病死亡率。.
结论: 
世卫组织制定的非传染性疾病过早死亡率指标是对老年人非传染性疾病死亡率的预测，该指标不应被视作年龄歧视。测量非传染性疾病过早死亡率可适当集中资源，尤其是在暂无民事死亡登记的国家。使用此方法不得有损于全民健康覆盖服务。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Изучить, является ли дискриминирующим по отношению к пожилым 
людям подход, связанный с основным измеряемым параметром, определяющим прогресс 
в достижении цели устойчивого развития 3.4, то есть с измерением показателя 
преждевременной смертности от неинфекционных заболеваний (смертности среди людей 
в возрасте 30–69 лет).
МЕТОДЫ: Для изучения взаимосвязи между преждевременной смертностью от 
неинфекционных заболеваний и смертностью от неинфекционных заболеваний у пожилых 
людей была составлена база данных по показателям смертности от 
сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, рака, хронической обструктивной болезни легких 
и диабета у людей в возрасте от 30 до 69 лет и у людей в возрасте от 70 до 
89 лет. В основу базы данных легли оценки, сделанные в ходе исследования 
глобального бремени болезней в 2017 году. Данные охватывали 195 стран, шесть 
временных точек и представителей обоих полов; всего 2340 случаев. Для получения 
измеряемых показателей преждевременной смертности от неинфекционных заболеваний 
к данным применялся метод таблиц вероятности дожития, принятый Всемирной 
организацией здравоохранения (ВОЗ).
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Была обнаружена тесная взаимосвязь между показателями смертности от 
неинфекционных заболеваний в группе преждевременной смертности и в группе 
пожилого возраста, что позволяет предположить информативность измерения 
преждевременной смертности от неинфекционных заболеваний как индикатора такой 
смертности в пожилом возрасте. Ни время, ни географическое положение не 
оказывало существенного влияния на эту взаимосвязь. Однако были обнаружены 
различия в показателях между мужчинами и женщинами в части вероятности смерти от 
неинфекционных заболеваний для конкретного возраста, что позволяет предположить 
необходимость раздельной оценки показателей смертности от неинфекционных 
заболеваний по половому признаку.
ВЫВОДЫ: Поскольку установленные ВОЗ измеряемые показатели преждевременной 
смертности от неинфекционных заболеваний позволяют прогнозировать смертность от 
этих заболеваний в пожилом возрасте, их не следует рассматривать как возрастную 
дискриминацию пожилых людей. Выделение ресурсов на измерение масштабов 
преждевременной смертности от неинфекционных заболеваний будет обосновано, в 
частности, в условиях, где отсутствует всеобщая система регистрации смертей. 
Такой подход не должен препятствовать предоставлению услуг здравоохранения на 
всем протяжении жизни человека.

The advances in medicine, together with lifestyle modifications, led to a rising 
life expectancy. Unfortunately, however, aging is accompanied by an alarming 
boost of age-associated chronic pathologies, including neurodegenerative and 
metabolic diseases. Interestingly, a non-negligible interplay between 
alterations of glucose homeostasis and brain dysfunction has clearly emerged. In 
particular, epidemiological studies have pointed out a possible association 
between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Insulin resistance, 
one of the major hallmark for etiology of T2D, has a detrimental influence on 
PD, negatively affecting PD phenotype, accelerating its progression and 
worsening cognitive impairment. This review aims to provide an exhaustive 
analysis of the most recent evidences supporting the key role of insulin 
resistance in PD pathogenesis. It will focus on the relevance of insulin in the 
brain, working as pro-survival neurotrophic factor and as a master regulator of 
neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. Insulin action as a 
modulator of dopamine signaling and of alpha-synuclein degradation will be 
described in details, too. The intriguing idea that shared deregulated 
pathogenic pathways represent a link between PD and insulin resistance has 
clinical and therapeutic implications. Thus, ongoing studies about the promising 
healing potential of common antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, exenatide, DPP 
IV inhibitors, thiazolidinediones and bromocriptine, will be summarized and the 
rationale for their use to decelerate neurodegeneration will be critically 
assessed.

The number of older patients with esophageal cancer (EC) is increasing due to 
the population aging and increasing life expectancy. However, no optimal 
treatment strategy for older patients with EC has been established to date. The 
aim of the present study was to review and compare the treatment modalities and 
outcomes of 990 younger and older patients diagnosed with EC in our institution. 
The patients were divided into younger (≤74 years) and older (≥75 years) groups. 
The majority of the patients in both groups had early-stage EC and were treated 
by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The older patients with locally 
advanced (stage II and III) EC were more likely to undergo chemoradiotherapy 
rather than esophagectomy. Among the older patients, 22% selected best 
supportive care. The disease-specific survival rate of the older patients was 
significantly lower compared with that of the younger patients, which was likely 
due to the less intense treatment modalities applied. The prognosis following 
esophagectomy was significantly better compared with that of chemoradiotherapy 
in the younger, but not in the older patients. In conclusion, the poorer 
prognosis of older patients (aged ≥75 years) with stage I EC may improve with 
multidisciplinary treatment after ESD. Although CRT is currently considered the 
optimal treatment for older patients with stage II/III EC, more efficient 
treatment modalities are urgently required.

OBJECTIVES: It is essential to measure and monitor the burden of dental caries 
and periodontal disease (PD) in Korea's ageing population due to their potential 
impact on morbidity, quality of life and economic condition. This study aimed to 
quantify the size of burden of dental caries and PD using the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and their trends.
METHODS: DALYs were estimated using incidence-based approaches to calculate the 
burden of dental caries and PD from 2013 to 2015 in Korea. Incidence and 
prevalence were estimated using medical claim data by specific algorithms. 
Additionally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate possible 
weakness in the study methodology. To conduct the sensitivity analysis, we 
modified the algorithms to estimate prevalence and incidence.
RESULTS: The burden of dental caries and PD increased by 39.2% and 57.0%, 
respectively, between 2013 and 2015. In 2015, dental caries and PD ranked 11th 
and 25th, respectively, in terms of the leading causes of DALYs. The burden of 
dental caries was the most substantial in children aged 0-9 years, while that of 
PD was the most substantial among those in their ages of 40 and 50 (per 100 000 
population). After sensitivity analysis with a modified disease algorithm, the 
magnitude of disease burden changed considerably.
CONCLUSIONS: Dental caries and PD constitute substantial burdens in South Korea. 
Despite the known limitations, medical claims data can be a powerful resource 
for conducting timely and cost-effective measurements of oral health. In 
countries, where universal dental schemes are available, there is need to 
estimate the burden of oral disease using claims data, for methodical advances 
in the research field.

AIM: Nocturia is a common phenomenon in older individuals, and is associated 
with poor quality of life. Nocturia is a multifactorial disorder, wherein the 
frailty of skeletal muscles, particularly muscle weakness in the lower trunk and 
hip regions, might be a risk factor in women. We analyzed a dataset of the 
general Japanese population to clarify the hypothesis.
METHODS: Study participants included 1207 older women (mean age 
67.4 ± 5.2 years). The frequency of nocturnal urination was assessed using a 
sleep diary for 1 week, and associations with lower muscle strength, skeletal 
muscle index, sarcopenia and physical performance (one-leg standing time and 
Timed Up and Go test) were investigated.
RESULTS: The frequency of nocturnal urination more than one voiding per night 
was 28.1%; this frequency was inversely associated with hip abduction strength 
quartiles (Q1: 37.0, Q2: 30.5, Q3: 25.1 and Q4: 19.9%, P < 0.001). When a sleep 
diary-based nocturnal urination frequency >1.5 times/night (corresponding to 
a ≥2 times/night frequency obtained by questionnaire) was considered as 
nocturia, logistic regression analysis adjusted for major covariates identified 
hip abduction strength as an independent inverse determinant of nocturia (odds 
ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.52-0.90, P = 0.002). In contrast, no significant 
association was observed with knee extension (P = 0.322) and hip flexion (P = 
0.603) strengths. Physical performance, skeletal muscle index and sarcopenia did 
not show significant associations with nocturia.
CONCLUSIONS: Weak hip abduction strength might be a factor associated with 
nocturnal urination frequency in older women. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 
1010-1016.

The BORDER III trial found that five-layer silicone border dressings effectively 
prevented pressure injuries in long-term care, but the value of this approach is 
unknown. Our objective was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of preventing 
facility-acquired pressure injuries with a quality improvement bundle, including 
prophylactic five-layer dressings in US and Australian long-term care. Markov 
models analysed the cost utility for pressure injuries acquired during long-term 
care from US and Australian perspectives. Models calibrated outcomes for 
standard care compared with a dressing-inclusive bundle over 18 monthly cycles 
or until death based on BORDER III outcomes. Patients who developed a pressure 
injury simulated advancement through stages 1 to 4. Univariate and multivariate 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested modelling uncertainty. Costs in 2017 
USD and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to calculate an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Dressing use yielded greater QALYs 
at slightly higher costs from perspectives. The US ICER was $36 652/QALY, while 
the Australian ICER was $15 898/QALY, both of which fell below a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis favoured dressings as cost-effective for most simulations. A quality 
improvement bundle, including prophylactic five-layer dressings, is a 
cost-effective approach for pressure injury prevention in all US and Australia 
long-term care residents.

BACKGROUND: Improved life expectancy and advanced diagnostic tools including 
computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have increased the awareness 
and diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas in the elderly population. The 
risk/benefit ratio of surgery in elderly patients with intracranial meningioma 
has not been clearly defined because of the lack of objective measurement tools. 
We aimed to understand the risk factors associated with postsurgical outcomes 
and how these risk factors affected postsurgical outcomes in elderly patients 
with intracranial meningioma.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 1372 patients, who were operated on for 
intracranial meningioma, using our prospectively collected database. The same 
senior author operated on all patients at 2 different tertiary clinics. 
Patients' clinical charts, presurgical postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic 
resonance images, operative reports, and pathology reports were reviewed. The 
relevant literature was also reviewed.
RESULTS: Higher age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class, 
presence of comorbidities, tumor location, larger initial tumor size, and 
presence of peritumoral edema were all associated with postsurgical 
complications in elderly patients with intracranial meningioma. Age ≥50 years 
was the strongest predictor of postsurgical systemic complications, whereas 
higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class was the strongest predictor 
of postsurgical neurologic complications. A literature review showed higher 
morbidity and mortality of elderly patients with intracranial meningioma. 
Initial tumor size and postsurgical MIB-1 labeling index were higher in the 
elderly patients, both of which were predictors of tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though elderly patients operated on for intracranial 
meningioma had higher morbidity and mortality compared with younger patients, 
surgery is still much more beneficial than wait-and-see strategy in elderly 
patients.

Aim: To compare the clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of maximum androgen 
blockade (MAB), docetaxel to androgen deprivation therapy (Doc-ADT) and ADT 
alone for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer in China. Methods: A network meta-analysis and a Markov model were 
adopted for effectiveness and economic evaluation. Results: The hazard ratios of 
overall survival and progression-free survival were 0.782 and 0.628 for Doc-ADT 
versus ADT alone; 0.897 and 0.824 for MAB versus ADT alone. Doc-ADT was 
cost-effective compared with MAB and ADT alone, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of CNY 96,848 and CNY 67,758 per quality-adjusted life 
year, respectively. MAB was cost-effective compared with ADT alone, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CNY 137,487 per quality-adjusted life 
year. Conclusion: Doc-ADT is likely the optimal option from the perspective of 
both clinical outcomes and economic considerations.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the relationship between enrolment in a 
school-based oral health prevention program (SOHP) and: 1) children's dental 
health status and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), and 2) mothers' 
oral health (OH) knowledge, attitude, practice, and OHRQoL.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study, in the Kuwait Capital, included 440 primary 
school children aged 11 to 12 years and their mothers. Participants were 
classified into two groups: SOHP and non-SOHP. The SOHP group had been enrolled 
in the prevention program for at least 3 years: children had twice-a-year 
applications of fluoride varnish and fissure sealants if needed; mothers had, at 
least, one oral health education session. The non-SOHP group had negative 
consents and had not been exposed to the prevention program activities. Dental 
examinations were performed at schools using portable dental units. Caries 
experience was determined using the decayed (D/d), missing (M/m), and filled 
(F/f) teeth (T/t)/surface (S/s) indices. Children's OHRQoL was assessed using a 
self-administered validated Child Perceptions Questionnaire 11-14 (CPQ11-14). 
Mothers' OH knowledge, attitude, practice, and OHRQoL were also assessed. After 
Bonferroni correction, a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant for caries experience measures while a p-value of less than 0.013 
was considered statistically significant for OHRQoL subscales and mothers' OH 
knowledge, attitude, practice, and OHRQoL.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) DT/dt, DMFT/dmft and DMFS/dmfs were 1.41 (1.66), 2.35 (2.33), 
and 4.41 (5.86) for SOHP children, respectively. For non-SOHP children, the 
means were 2.61 (2.63), 3.56 (3.05), and 7.24 (7.78), respectively. The 
difference between the SOHP and non-SOHP was statistically significant 
(p <  0.001). Children enrolled in the program had a higher number of sealed and 
restored teeth. No significant differences were found in CPQ11-14 scores or 
subscale scores between the two groups. No significant difference in mothers' OH 
knowledge, attitude, practices or OHRQoL was found between SOHP and non-SOHP 
groups (P > 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Enrolment in the SOHP prevention services was associated with a 
positive impact on children's caries level with no significant impact on 
mothers' knowledge, attitude, practice, or OHRQoL.

CONTEXT: The Community Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended 
multicomponent interventions to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer 
screening based on strong evidence of effectiveness. This systematic review 
examines the economic evidence to guide decisions on the implementation of these 
interventions.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search for economic evidence was 
performed from January 2004 to January 2018. All monetary values were reported 
in 2016 US dollars, and the analysis was completed in 2018.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifty-three studies were included in the body of evidence 
from a literature search yield of 8,568 total articles. For multicomponent 
interventions to increase breast cancer screening, the median intervention cost 
per participant was $26.69 (interquartile interval [IQI]=$3.25, $113.72), and 
the median incremental cost per additional woman screened was $147.64 
(IQI=$32.92, $924.98). For cervical cancer screening, the median costs per 
participant and per additional woman screened were $159.80 (IQI=$117.62, 
$214.73) and $159.49 (IQI=$64.74, $331.46), respectively. Two studies reported 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of $748 and $33,433. For 
colorectal cancer screening, the median costs per participant and per additional 
person screened were $36.63 (IQI=$7.70, $139.23) and $582.44 (IQI=$91.10, 
$1,452.12), respectively. Two studies indicated a decline in incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life year gained of $1,651 and $3,817.
CONCLUSIONS: Multicomponent interventions to increase cervical and colorectal 
cancer screening were cost effective based on a very conservative threshold. 
Additionally, multicomponent interventions for colorectal cancer screening 
demonstrated net cost savings. Cost effectiveness for multicomponent 
interventions to increase breast cancer screening could not be determined owing 
to the lack of studies reporting incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
gained. Future studies estimating this outcome could assist implementers with 
decision making.

The study investigated the effect of sourdough made from combinations of four 
Lactobacillus spp. on the physicochemical properties, consumer acceptability, 
and shelf life of bread made from pearl millet flour. Fermentation based on both 
single and multiple species reduced the pH of the dough and increased its 
titratable acidity and H2O2 content. The addition of sourdough increased the 
elasticity and reduced the stiffness of the pearl millet dough. Sourdough 
fermented with L. brevis had the greatest effect on loaf height, specific 
volume, porosity, and moisture content. During storage, the moisture content of 
the bread crumb decreased, but that of their crust increased. Sourdough-based 
loaves retained their moisture better than conventional loaves and the sourdough 
suppressed the development of mold for a longer period. An organoleptic 
assessment showed that the sourdough-based bread was more palatable than either 
conventional or chemically acidified ones. The tissue softness, chewiness, and 
flavor of the pearl millet bread decreased during storage. The use of sourdough 
based on either L. brevis, L. paralimentarius, or L. brevis + L. paralimentarius 
is recommended to produce high-quality pearl millet-based bread.

Aim: Osimertinib improves progression-free survival in first-line EGFR 
mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Materials & methods: A Markov 
cohort model including costs, utilities and disutilities, was conducted to 
estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio when treating with osimertinib versus standard first-line tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs). Results: Osimertinib presented higher QALYs (0.61) compared 
with standard EGFR-TKIs (0.42). Osimertinib costs were €83,258.99, in comparison 
with €29,209.45 for the standard EGFR-TKIs. An incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of €273,895.36/QALY was obtained for osimertinib. Conclusion: Osimertinib 
was more effective in terms of QALYs gained than comparators 
(erlotinib-gefitinib). However, to obtain a cost-effectiveness alternative, a 
discount greater than 60% in osimertinib acquisition cost is required.

BACKGROUND: Since the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan 
Africa (sSA) in the early 2000s, the life expectancy of people infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased. However, the gains made in 
reducing mortality from HIV-related complications have been mitigated by the 
emergence of age-related chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as 
hypertension. Protease inhibitors (PIs), and prolonged exposure to highly active 
ART (HAART) have been implicated in the development of hypertension in 
HIV-positive people.
AIM: To investigate the prevalence of hypertension and its associated risk 
factors among HIV-positive patients receiving ART.
SETTING: The study was carried out at an urban-based clinic that provides HAART 
and primary care to HIV-positive people in Harare, Zimbabwe.
METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among non-pregnant 
adults on HAART attending the clinic between July and August 2018.
RESULTS: We studied 600 HIV-positive adult patients, of which 56% were women. 
The prevalence rate of hypertension was 29.9%. Of the participants in the 
hypertensive group, 11.2% were not previously diagnosed or on treatment. Factors 
associated with hypertension were advanced age, use of HAART for longer than 10 
years, being overweight, a family history of hypertension and smoking. There was 
a 68.8% prevalence of body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2 among all 
participants.
CONCLUSION: High hypertension prevalence was recorded. Hypertension was not 
associated with gender or use of PI regimens but being overweight was highly 
prevalent. Greater vigilance and integration of resources is required in the 
overall treatment and monitoring of HIV-positive patients for co-morbidities.

Puppy neonatal mortality may be related to low birth weight, which has been 
shown in humans to be linked to placental factors. The relation between the 
newborn puppy and the placental characteristics has been poorly investigated in 
dogs. Twenty bitches, 9 toy-sized (i.e. < 5 Kg) and 11 small-sized (i.e. 5 to 
10 Kg), were included in this study. During natural delivery or c-section, 
puppies were identified and their order of birth, sex and weight were recorded. 
Puppy weights were registered at birth and daily until Day 6. Placentas were 
weighed after removal of extraplacental adnexa, after which a photo was taken 
and morphometrically assessed. The Total Placental Area (TPA) and the Transfer 
Zone Area (TZA) were calculated and their surface expressed in mm2. 
Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal mouse anti CD31 antibody was used to 
identify fetal and maternal vessels in the placental labyrinth zone. A 
vascularization index (VI) was determined for each placenta and the Total 
Vascular Area (TVA) was estimated. Puppies' birth weight correlated positively 
with placental weight (P < 0.001, r = 0.689). A positive correlation was found 
between the puppies' birth weight and TPA (P < 0.001, r = 0.786), TZA 
(P < 0.001, r = 0.772), and TVA (P < 0.001, r = 0.482). A positive correlation 
was also found between placental weight and TPA (P < 0.001, r = 0.661), TZA 
(P < 0.001, r = 0.583), and TVA (P < 0.001, r = 0.333). In the small-sized 
breeds, the placentas of low-weight puppies were lighter and had a smaller TZA 
and TVA (P < 0.05). The VI was higher in the placentas of the toy-sized compared 
to small-sized bitches (P < 0.01). No effect of parity, litter size, or sex of 
the puppy was observed on birth weight or growth rates on Day 6. The growth 
pattern of low-weight puppies did not differ from that of the other puppies 
during the first 6 days of life. As in humans, placental weight, the extension 
of the transfer zone and placental total vascular area correlates closely with 
the puppies' birth weight in normal pregnancies. Our data could represent 
reference values for placental weight, TZA, TVA and VI in toy and small-sized 
dog breeds.

There is growing evidence that peptidic glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists (GLP-1RA), such as exenatide, may provide useful therapeutic options 
for treatment of feline diabetes. However, because such drugs are administered 
subcutaneously, it is desirable that they be long-acting and not require 
frequent injections. We have developed a chemically controlled delivery system 
to support half-life extension of peptidic therapeutics. Here, the peptide is 
covalently attached to hydrogel microspheres by a self-cleaving β-eliminative 
linker; after subcutaneous injection of the microspheres, the peptide is slowly 
released from the depot to the systemic circulation. Using this technology, we 
developed a delivery system that supports once-monthly administration of a 
stable exenatide analog, [Gln28]exenatide, in rodents (Schneider, et al, ACS 
Chem Biol 12, 2107 to 2116, 2017). The purposes of the present study were a) to 
demonstrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic similarities of the 
deamidation-sensitive GLP-1RA exenatide and the closely related, more stable 
[Gln28]exenatide and b) to develop a long-acting GLP-1RA in cats. The results 
show that exenatide and [Gln28]exenatide injected intravenously or 
subcutaneously at 10 μg/kg have nearly identical pharmacokinetics in the 
cat-both having elimination half-lives of ∼40 min-but subcutaneously 
administered [Gln28]exenatide has superior bioavailability-93% for 
[Gln28]exenatide vs 52% for exenatide. The results also show that exenatide and 
[Gln28]exenatide have similar insulinotropic activities in the cat during a 
high-dose intravenous glucose tolerance test; they increased the area under the 
curve (AUC) for insulin to a similar extent but had no effect on glucose AUC. 
Finally, subcutaneous injection of a microsphere-[Gln28]exenatide conjugate 
containing an appropriate self-cleaving linker in the cat provides plasma 
[Gln28]exenatide with a half-life of about 40 d vs 40 min with the injected free 
peptide. Hence, the large body of information available for exenatide can be 
used to facilitate clinical development of [Gln28]exenatide as a treatment for 
feline diabetes, and the microsphere-[Gln28]exenatide conjugate is quite 
suitable for once-monthly subcutaneous administration of the peptide in the cat.

BACKGROUND: Lack of exercise is a prevalent problem in patients receiving 
dialysis. Although guidelines recommend these patients to undertake suitable 
exercise, no exercise type or intensity has been suggested, and the effect of 
exercise on muscle fitness in dialysis patients is not clear. This study 
investigated the effect of exercise on muscle fitness, including muscle mass, 
muscle strength, and physical performance, in patients on dialysis.
METHODS: A systematic review and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) were conducted. Five English and 4 Chinese databases were searched from 
their inception to July 2018. Two independent reviewers searched the different 
databases, selected trials, conducted bias assessment, and extracted the data.
RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this 
review. Pooled results demonstrated that resistance training significantly 
improved leg mass (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.34, 95% CI [0.06-0.62], p= 
0.02) whereas aerobic training did not (SMD 0.87, 95% CI [-0.11 to 1.86], p = 
0.08). Resistance training increased both grip strength (weighted mean 
difference [WMD] 4.71 kg, 95% CI [2.42-6.99], p < 0.00001) and knee extension 
strength (WMD 3.93 kg, 95% CI [0.59-7.28], p = 0.02) significantly. Aerobic 
training improved grip strength (WMD 7.70 kg, 95% CI [3.35-12.05], p= 0.005) and 
the time of finishing short version of the sit-to-stand test (STS; WMD -4.69 s, 
95% CI [-9.01 to -0.38], p = 0.03) but with insufficient evidence. In the 
dimension of physical performance, both aerobic training and resistance training 
have some beneficial effect on improving the score of 6-min walking test (WMD 
85.76 m, 95% CI [63.43-108.09], p < 0.00001; WMD 41.92 m, 95% CI [8.06-75.75], p 
= 0.02, respectively) and median version of STS test (WMD 4.30 repetitions, 95% 
CI [1.22-7.39], p = 0.006; WMD 2.60 repetitions, 95% CI [0.64-4.56], p = 0.006, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Regular resistance training with a moderate to high intensity may 
lead to improvement in muscle mass and muscle strength of patients undergoing 
dialysis, especially for the trained muscles. Both aerobic training and 
resistance training may help dialysis patients improve physical performance.

The increase in total hip arthroplasty occurs by many factors, such as 
increasing life expectancy, improving surgical technique as well as innovating 
the design and implant material. However, despite technological advances, 
peri-prosthetic infection has remained one of the most devastating 
complications. This study evaluates the prophylactic application of calcium 
sulfate pearls medicated in the femoral canal and acetabular surface to prevent 
peri-prosthetic infections in patients who underwent total uncemented primary 
hip arthroplasty against a control group by measuring acute phase reactants. 146 
patients, 67 were applied calcium sulfate pearls medicated and 79 prophylactic 
antibiotic intravenous in the period from 2013 to 2016. To perform the diagnosis 
of peri-prosthetic infection was assessed PCR associated with VSG, communication 
between fistula and prostheses and positive culture in 2 or more different 
sites. There was a decrease in the values of acute-phase reactants in patients 
who were given calcium sulfate pearls. 14 patients presented infection in the 
control group and 3 in the study group. The prophylactic use of calcium sulphate 
pearls within the medullary canal and acetabular surface is an option for the 
prophylaxis of peri-prosthetic infections, however the study deserves follow-up 
with more patients.

Publisher: El incremento en la cirugía de artroplastía total de cadera es 
motivado por muchos factores, como el aumento en la expectativa de vida, mejoría 
continua en la técnica quirúrgica e innovaciones en el diseño y los materiales 
de los implantes que, sumados, han convertido a este procedimiento en una 
solución efectiva a la degeneración articular, con excelentes resultados. Sin 
embargo, a pesar de los avances tecnológicos, la infección periprotésica se ha 
mantenido como una de las complicaciones más devastadoras. Este estudio evalúa 
la aplicación profiláctica de perlas de sulfato de calcio medicadas en el canal 
femoral y superficie acetabular para prevenir infecciones periprotésicas en 
pacientes que fueron sometidos a una artroplastía total de cadera primaria no 
cementada contra un grupo control mediante la medición de reactantes de fase 
aguda y cultivo de líquido sinovial. Se sometieron al estudio 146 individuos: 67 
a quienes se les aplicaron perlas de sulfato de calcio medicado y 79 a quienes 
se les aplicó antibiótico profiláctico intravenoso de Septiembre de 2013 a 
Agosto de 2016. Como método diagnóstico de infección periprotésica temprana se 
evaluaron la proteína C reactiva asociada a velocidad de sedimentación globular 
aumentada, una fístula que comunicara con la prótesis, cultivo positivo de dos o 
más sitios periprotésicos de líquido sinovial o tejido. Los resultados clínicos 
demostraron que hubo una disminución en los valores de los reactantes de fase 
aguda en los sujetos a quienes se les aplicaron las perlas de sulfato de calcio 
medicado. Se encontró que 14 personas presentaron infección en el grupo con 
profilaxis parenteral, comparado con tres del grupo con profilaxis local con 
perlas de sulfato de calcio medicado; ambos grupos con ceftriaxona. Se consideró 
que el uso profiláctico de perlas de sulfato de calcio dentro de canal medular y 
la superficie acetabular es una buena opción para prevenir infecciones 
periprotésicas en quienes han sido sometidos a una artroplastía total de cadera 
primaria no cementada; sin embargo el estudio amerita seguimiento con más 
pacientes para tener significancia estadística.

Osteoporosis is a frequently observed complication in patients with chronic 
liver disease, particularly liver cirrhosis and cholestatic liver diseases. In 
addition, osteoporosis is critical in patients receiving a liver transplant. 
Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated bone diseases in patients with more 
frequently observed chronic liver disease, such as chronic viral hepatitis, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Osteoporosis is a 
disease caused by an imbalance in the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. 
Over the last few decades, many advances have improved our knowledge of the 
pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Importantly, activated immune cells affect the 
progression of osteoporosis, and chronic inflammation may exert an additional 
effect on the existing pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The microbiota of the 
intestinal tract may also affect the progression of bone loss in patients with 
chronic liver disease. Recently, studies regarding the effects of chronic 
inflammation on dysbiosis in bone diseases have been conducted. However, 
mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease are 
complex and precise mechanisms remain unknown. The following special 
considerations in patients with chronic liver disease are reviewed: bone 
diseases in patients who underwent a liver transplant, the association between 
chronic hepatitis B virus infection treatment and bone diseases, the association 
between sarcopenia and bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease, and 
the association between chronic liver disease and avascular necrosis of the hip. 
Few guidelines are currently available for the management of low bone mineral 
density or bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease. Due to 
increased life expectancy and therapeutic advances in chronic liver disease, the 
importance of managing osteoporosis and other bone diseases in patients with 
chronic liver disease is expected to increase. Consequently, specific guidelines 
need to be established in the near future.

Cardiomyopathy is a manifestation of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), which is 
an underrecognized systemic disease whereby the transthyretin protein misfolds 
to form fibrils that deposit in various tissues and organs. ATTR amyloidosis is 
debilitating and associated with poor life expectancy, especially in those with 
cardiac dysfunction, but a variety of treatment options have recently become 
available. Considered a rare disease, ATTR amyloidosis may be more prevalent 
than thought, particularly in older persons. Diagnosis is often delayed because 
of a lack of disease awareness and the heterogeneity of symptoms at 
presentation. Given the recent availability of effective treatments, early 
recognition and diagnosis are especially critical because treatment is likely 
more effective earlier in the disease course. The Amyloidosis Research 
Consortium recently convened a group of experts in ATTR amyloidosis who, through 
an iterative process, agreed on best practices for suspicion, diagnosis, and 
characterization of disease. This review describes these consensus 
recommendations for ATTR associated with cardiomyopathy as a resource to aid 
cardiologists and others in the recognition and diagnosis of ATTR associated 
with cardiomyopathy. Included in this review is an overview of red flag signs
