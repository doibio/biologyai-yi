air pollution (0·61 million [0·39-0·86]). The death rate due to household air 
pollution decreased by 64·2% (52·2-74·2) from 1990 to 2019, while that due to 
ambient particulate matter pollution increased by 115·3% (28·3-344·4) and that 
due to ambient ozone pollution increased by 139·2% (96·5-195·8). Lost output 
from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution accounted for 
economic losses of US$28·8 billion (21·4-37·4) and $8·0 billion (5·9-10·3), 
respectively, in India in 2019. This total loss of $36·8 billion (27·4-47·7) was 
1·36% of India's gross domestic product (GDP). The economic loss as a proportion 
of the state GDP varied 3·2 times between the states, ranging from 0·67% 
(0·47-0·91) to 2·15% (1·60-2·77), and was highest in the low per-capita GDP 
states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. 
Delhi had the highest per-capita economic loss due to air pollution, followed by 
Haryana in 2019, with 5·4 times variation across all states.
INTERPRETATION: The high burden of death and disease due to air pollution and 
its associated substantial adverse economic impact from loss of output could 
impede India's aspiration to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024. Successful 
reduction of air pollution in India through state-specific strategies would lead 
to substantial benefits for both the health of the population and the economy.

BACKGROUND: Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by delayed primary 
surgery (DPS) is an established strategy for women with newly diagnosed, 
advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. Although this therapeutic approach has 
been validated in randomised, phase 3 trials, evaluation of response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 
version 1.1 (RECIST), and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) has not been reported. We 
describe RECIST and Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA125 responses in 
patients receiving platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by DPS in 
the ICON8 trial.
METHODS: ICON8 was an international, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done 
across 117 hospitals in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, South Korea, and 
Ireland. The trial included women aged 18 years or older with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, life expectancy of more 
than 12 weeks, and newly diagnosed International Federation of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics (FIGO; 1988) stage IC-IIA high-grade serous, clear cell, or any 
poorly differentiated or grade 3 histological subtype, or any FIGO (1988) stage 
IIB-IV epithelial cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum. 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive intravenous carboplatin (area 
under the curve [AUC]5 or AUC6) and intravenous paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 by body 
surface area) on day 1 of every 21-day cycle (control group; group 1); 
intravenous carboplatin (AUC5 or AUC6) on day 1 and intravenous 
dose-fractionated paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 by body surface area) on days 1, 8, and 
15 of every 21-day cycle (group 2); or intravenous dose-fractionated carboplatin 
(AUC2) and intravenous dose-fractionated paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 by body surface 
area) on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 21-day cycle (group 3). The maximum number 
of cycles of chemotherapy permitted was six. Randomisation was done with a 
minimisation method, and patients were stratified according to GCIG group, 
disease stage, and timing and outcome of cytoreductive surgery. Patients and 
clinicians were not masked to group allocation. The scheduling of surgery and 
use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were determined by local multidisciplinary case 
review. In this post-hoc exploratory analysis of ICON8, progression-free 
survival was analysed using the landmark method and defined as the time interval 
between the date of pre-surgical planning radiological tumour assessment to the 
date of investigator-assessed clinical or radiological progression or death, 
whichever occurred first. This definition is different from the 
intention-to-treat primary progression-free survival analysis of ICON8, which 
defined progression-free survival as the time from randomisation to the date of 
first clinical or radiological progression or death, whichever occurred first. 
We also compared the extent of surgical cytoreduction with RECIST and GCIG CA125 
responses. This post-hoc exploratory analysis includes only women recruited to 
ICON8 who were planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by DPS and had 
RECIST and/or GCIG CA125-evaluable disease. ICON8 is closed for enrolment and 
follow-up, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01654146.
FINDINGS: Between June 6, 2011, and Nov 28, 2014, 1566 women were enrolled in 
ICON8, of whom 779 (50%) were planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by 
DPS. Median follow-up was 29·5 months (IQR 15·6-54·3) for the neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by DPS population. Of 564 women who had RECIST-evaluable 
disease at trial entry, 348 (62%) had a complete or partial response. Of 727 
women who were evaluable by GCIG CA125 criteria at the time of diagnosis, 610 
(84%) had a CA125 response. Median progression-free survival was 14·4 months 
(95% CI 9·2-28·0; 297 events) for patients with a RECIST complete or partial 
response and 13·3 months (8·1-20·1; 171 events) for those with RECIST stable 
disease. Median progression-free survival for women with a GCIG CA125 response 
was 13·8 months (95% CI 8·8-23·4; 544 events) and 9·7 months (5·8-14·5; 111 
events) for those without a GCIG CA125 response. Complete cytoreduction (R0) was 
achieved in 187 (56%) of 335 women with a RECIST complete or partial response 
and 73 (42%) of 172 women with RECIST stable disease. Complete cytoreduction was 
achieved in 290 (50%) of 576 women with a GCIG CA125 response and 30 (30%) of 
101 women without a GCIG CA125 response.
INTERPRETATION: The RECIST-defined radiological response rate was lower than 
that frequently quoted to patients in the clinic. RECIST and GCIG CA125 
responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer should not 
be used as individual predictive markers to stratify patients who are likely to 
benefit from DPS, but instead used in conjunction with the patient's clinical 
capacity to undergo cytoreductive surgery. A patient should not be denied 
surgery based solely on the lack of a RECIST or GCIG CA125 response.

The melon aphid, Aphis gossypii is a globally distributed crop pest with a wide 
host range. The intensive use of insecticides against this insect over several 
years has led to develop resistance against many insecticides including 
acetamiprid. Understanding the relationship between acetamiprid resistance and 
fitness of A. gossypii is essential to limit the spread of the resistant 
population in the field. In this study, age-stage, two-sex life table approach 
was used to investigate these relationships in the lab. Results showed that 
resistant strain (Ace-R) had a reduced fitness (relative fitness = 0.909) along 
with significantly decreased adult longevity, fecundity, net reproductive (R0), 
mean generation time (T) and gross reproductive rate (GRR). Compared to the 
susceptible strain (Ace-S), the pre-adult period and total pre-oviposition 
period (TPOP) were also significantly shorter in Ace-R strain. Moreover, the 
expression profiles of EcR, JHBP, JHAMT, JHEH, USP and Vg genes supposed to be 
involved in insect reproduction and development were analyzed using Quantitative 
Real Time PCR. The EcR, JHBP, JHAMT and USP genes were up-regulated, Vg gene was 
down-regulated while the mRNA level of JHEH gene was statistically same in the 
Ace-R strain compared to the Ace-S strain. Collectively, this study provides the 
occurrence and magnitude of fitness costs of A. gossypii against acetamiprid 
resistance and could be helpful to manage the resistance evolution in field 
populations.

As global life expectancy continues to rise, we are challenged with maintaining 
health into old age. One strategy is to target the chronic low-level 
inflammation associated with aging, termed inflammaging. This is characterized 
by increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and a shift toward 
cellular senescence, changes that are believed to drive many age-associated 
conditions, including dementia, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes. As with other 
organs, the skin undergoes functional decline during aging, becoming more 
fragile and susceptible to infection; however, the contribution of inflammaging 
is not well-understood. This review article describes the evidence for 
inflammaging in the skin, its relationship with senescence, and how this relates 
to declining skin structure and function.

The physical demands of daily life in developed countries have decreased 
remarkably during the last two centuries. General leisure time has increased and 
the age at retirement has decreased. General health has improved and life 
expectancy has increased. Most people can expect to live 20-30 years after 
retirement. By 2050, one in four people in Europe and North America will be aged 
65 or over. Furthermore, women live longer than men. Generally, the physical 
demands on older women will be low. Thus, their physical fitness will decline, 
which in turn will affect a variety of organ systems and functions, and so 
impact on mental health, quality of life and independent living. This opinion 
paper explores exercise strategies for healthy ageing.

AIM: To estimate and trend disability-adjusted life years (DALY) following adult 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) over time, and to compare OHCA DALY to 
other leading causes of death and disability in the U.S.
METHODS: DALY were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years 
lived with disability (YLD). Adult non-traumatic emergency medical 
services-treated OHCA from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival 
(CARES) database for 2013-2018 were used to estimate YLL. Cerebral performance 
category score disability weights were used to estimate YLD. The calculated DALY 
for the study population was extrapolated to a national level to estimate total 
U.S. DALY. Data were reported as DALY total and rate. Data were compared to the 
top 10 causes of DALY in the U.S.
RESULTS: 337,991 OHCA met study inclusion criteria. Total U.S. OHCA DALY 
increased from 3,005,308 in 2013 to 4,326,745 in 2018. The DALY rate increased 
from 950.9 per 100,000 individuals to 1322.4 per 100,000 individuals. OHCA DALY 
ranked fifth in the U.S. behind ischemic heart disease (2470), drug use 
disorders (1703), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1449), and back pain 
(1336). OHCA represented the largest percent increase in DALY rate (40.3%) over 
the study period.
CONCLUSION: Adult non-traumatic OHCA is a leading cause of DALY in the U.S. and 
the burden of disease due to OHCA has increased rapidly over time. These 
findings are likely due to more precise national OHCA surveillance, and suggest 
that the public health impact of OHCA is larger than previously described.

As transcatheter aortic valve Implantation (TAVI) moves to younger and lower 
risk patients with longer life expectancy, the long-term durability of TAVI is 
becoming an increasingly relevant issue. We sought to evaluate the long-term 
clinical outcome and prosthesis performance of the CoreValve self-expandable 
valve. Clinical registry of 182 patients consecutively treated with TAVI in a 
tertiary center from January 2009 to July 2017. Of these, 111 died during an 
average follow-up (FU) of 1,026 ± 812 days (median IQR: 745, 477 to 1,400 days; 
longest survival 11 years; 61% mortality at Kaplan-Meier analysis). At 1 month, 
functional profile improved in all survivors, with 93.9% of them achieving NYHA 
class I or II. At Cox analysis, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (HR: 
1.55; p = 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (HR: 1.65; p = 0.017) 
and incident acute kidney injury (HR: 1.96; p = 0.001) were independently 
associated with all-cause mortality. During FU, echocardiographically assessed 
mean transprosthetic aortic gradient remained substantially unchanged (from 9.0 
± 2.7 after TAVI to 9.0 ± 5.0 mm Hg at FU; p >0.05). Most patients had none 
and/or trivial (34%), or mild (58%), fewer had moderate (8%) and none had severe 
perivalvular leak, without significant change during FU. At 11 years, cumulative 
incidence of bioprosthetic valve failure and moderate structural valve 
deterioration (SVD) were 2.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 10%) and 9.3% (95% CI 3.3% to 
26.7%), respectively. In conclusion, our registry confirmed that TAVI with the 
self-expandable CoreValve system was associated with favorable long-term 
clinical outcomes, with a reassuring low rate of significant bioprosthetic valve 
failure and moderate SVD.

Neurons require adhesive scaffolds for their growth and differentiation. 
Laminins are a major cell adhesive component of basement membranes and have 
various biological activities in the peripheral and central nervous systems. 
Here, we evaluated the biological activities of 5 peptides derived from 
laminin-111 as a scaffold for mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells and rat neural 
stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). The 5 peptides showed Neuro2a cell attachment 
activity similar to that of poly-d-lysine. However, when NPCs were cultured on 
the peptides, 2 syndecan-binding peptides, AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT, mouse laminin α1 
chain 2719-2730) and C16 (KAFDITYVRLKF, laminin γ1 chain 139-150), demonstrated 
significantly higher cell attachment and neurite extension activities than other 
peptides including integrin-binding ones. Long-term cell culture experiments 
showed that both AG73 and C16 supported the growth of neurons and astrocytes 
that had differentiated from NPCs. Furthermore, C16 markedly promoted the 
expression of neuronal markers such as synaptosomal-associated protein-25 and 
syntaxin 1A. These results indicate that AG73 and C16 are useful for NPC 
cultures and that C16 can be applied to specialized research on synapses in 
differentiated neurons. These peptides have the potential for use as valuable 
biomaterials for NPC research.

BACKGROUND: Oncotype Dx is a 21-gene recurrence score, which is used as a 
diagnostic tool for the recurrence of breast cancer. It is also used to 
determine the benefit of chemotherapy for breast cancer in early stages. This 
study investigates the relationship of Oncotype Dx with pathological prognostic 
markers of protein Ki 67, Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) and tumor grade.
METHODS: Data for early breast cancer patients treated at our tertiary care 
center was collected for statistical analysis. Data for patients from 2014 to 
2018 was recorded for patient's age, ER/PR status, Ki 67, nodal status, tumor 
grade, NPI along with Oncotype Dx score. Metric measurements were described as 
mean ± SD and the non-metric data was represented by frequency (%). Chi-square 
or Fisher's exact tests as well as logistic regression was applied to assess the 
associations at 95% CI.
RESULTS: Among 156 breast cancer patients, the mean age was 55.7 ± 9.4 years. 
The tumors were classified into Grade-I (12.8%), Grade-II (67.3%) and Grade-III 
(19.9%). Ki67 score was 12.8 ± 12.0 and NPI score was 3.7 ± 0.8. The mean 
Oncotype Dx score was 17.0 ± 9.1; it was 14.1 ± 6.8 for Grade-I tumors; 
15.7 ± 7.5 for grade -II tumors; and 23.2 ± 12.3 for grade-III tumors [Mean 
Oncotype Dx score across Tumor grades was compared by ANOVA (η = 0.121), 
p < 0.001]. While logistic regression analyses for the dichotomized Oncotype Dx 
higher score (≥25) was significantly associated with grade-III tumors odds ratio 
(OR) = 13.72 (95% CI: 1.62-115.89), higher Ki67 (>20) OR = 14.40, (95% CI: 
1.44-143.71), average NPI score (2.41-3.40), OR = 13.60, (95% CI: 1.57-117.94) 
to poor NPI (>5.4). The association of Oncotype Dx with age, tumor size and 
nodal status was statistically not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that age, Ki67, tumor size and nodal status did 
not have a statistically significant impact on Oncotypye Dx recurrence score in 
the targeted patient population. There was a significant correlation of low 
grade node negative patients with Oncotype Dx while high grade node negative 
patients had poor correlations with Oncotype Dx. The use of Oncotype Dx has 
shown to be less cost-effective and has no noticeable association with improved 
life expectancy in the targeted patient population (i.e., hormone positive, node 
negative cases) in comparison with current clinical practices in Saudi Arabia 
and it is less likely to be cost-effective in this group of patients.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated on the benefit/risk ratio of surgery in octogenarians 
with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2005-2020, 100 octogenarians were operated on for a 
clinical stage IA to IIA NSCLC. All patients had undergone whole body PET -scan 
and brain imaging. Operability was assessed according to current guidelines 
regarding the cardiopulmonary function. Since 2015, patients followed a 
dedicated geriatric evaluation pathway. Minimally invasive approaches were used 
in 66 patients, and a thoracotomy in 34.
RESULTS: Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 4 complications occurred in 15 patients within 90 
days, including 7 fatalities. At multivariable analysis, the number of 
co-morbidities was their single independent prognosticator. Following resection, 
24 patients met pathological criteria for adjuvant therapy among whom 3 (12.5 %) 
received platinum-based chemotherapy. Five-year survival rates were overall (OS) 
47 ± 6.3 %, disease-free (DFS) 77.6 ± 5.1 %, and lung cancer-specific (CSS) 
74.7 ± 6.3 %. Diabetes mellitus impaired significantly long-term outcomes in 
these 3 dimensions. OS was improved since the introduction of a dedicated 
geriatric assessment pathway (72.3 % vs. 6.4 %, P = 0.00002), and when minimally 
invasive techniques were used (42.3 % vs. 11.3 %; P = 0.02). CSS was improved by 
the performance of systematic lymphadenectomy (55.3 % vs. 26.9 %; P = 0.04). 
Multivariable and recursive partitioning analyses showed that a decision tree 
could be built to predict overall survival on the basis of diabetes mellitus, 
high co-morbidity index and low ppoDLCO values.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a dedicated geriatric assessment pathway to 
select octogenarians for lung cancer surgery was associated with OS values that 
are similar to outcomes in younger patients. The use of minimally invasive 
surgery and the performance of systematic lymphadenectomy were also associated 
with improved long-term survival. Octogenarians with multiple co-morbid 
conditions, diabetes mellitus, or low ppo DLCO values may be more appropriately 
treated with SBRT.

BACKGROUND: Sociodemographic data indicate the progressive increase in life 
expectancy and the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is raised as one 
of the greatest public health problems. Its etiology is twofold: on the one 
hand, non-modifiable factors and on the other, modifiable.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a processing framework based on machine 
learning (ML) and optimization algorithms to study sociodemographic, clinical, 
and analytical variables, selecting the best combination among them for an 
accurate discrimination between controls and subjects with major neurocognitive 
disorder (MNCD).
METHODS: This research is based on an observational-analytical design. Two 
research groups were established: MNCD group (n = 46) and control group 
(n = 38). ML and optimization algorithms were employed to automatically diagnose 
MNCD.
RESULTS: Twelve out of 37 variables were identified in the validation set as the 
most relevant for MNCD diagnosis. Sensitivity of 100%and specificity of 71%were 
achieved using a Random Forest classifier.
CONCLUSION: ML is a potential tool for automatic prediction of MNCD which can be 
applied to relatively small preclinical and clinical data sets. These results 
can be interpreted to support the influence of the environment on the 
development of AD.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is an important health condition due to its 
prevalence and functional deterioration, being the most common cause of 
disability in people over 65 years of age. The Chilean Explicit 
Health-Guarantees regime provides coverage for medical treatment in mild and 
moderate presentations, excluding surgical treatment in end-stage knee 
osteoarthritis.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of incorporating total knee replacement 
to the Explicit Health-Guarantees regime for over-65-years beneficiaries of the 
public insurance system, versus maintenance with medical treatment.
METHODS: A Scoping review was coducted to identify model parameters and economic 
evaluation based in a 6 health states Markov Model, from the perspective of the 
public payer and lifetime horizon. The Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) was 
calculated, and deterministic and probabilistic uncertainty analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were selected as reference sources. If the regime 
were to adopt the procedure, the implication would be a benefit of 9.8 Years of 
Life Adjusted by Quality (QALY) versus 2.4 QALY in the scenario without access 
to total knee replacement. The ICUR was $ -445 689 CLP/QALY (U$D -633.8/QALY), 
wherein the inclusion of total knee replacement to the regime becomes a dominant 
alternative versus the current scenario. Each quality-adjusted life-year gained 
by the surgery will save CLP 445 689. At a willingness to pay of CLP 
502,596/QALY (U$D 714.7/QALY), access to surgery is cost-useful with a 99.9% 
certainty.
CONCLUSION: Total knee replacement in patients older than 65 years is a dominant 
alternative. Access to this procedure in the Chilean Explicit Health-Guarantees 
regime in the public system is cost-useful at a threshold of 1 GDP per capita.

Publisher: ANTECEDENTES: La osteoartritis destaca por su alta prevalencia y 
deterioro funcional, siendo la causa más común de incapacidad en mayores de 65 
años. El régimen de Garantías Explícitas en Salud chileno otorga cobertura a 
tratamiento médico a las presentaciones leves y moderadas, excluyendo el manejo 
quirúrgico en la presentación severa.
OBJETIVOS: Evaluar el costo-utilidad de incorporar el reemplazo total de rodilla 
al régimen de Garantías Explícitas en Salud para asegurados del seguro público 
sobre 65 años en Chile, versus la mantención con manejo farmacológico.
MÉTODOS: Revisión sistemática explortaria para identificar los parámetros del 
modelo y evaluaciones económicas basadas en un modelo de Markov de seis estados 
de salud, desde la perspectiva del pagador público y horizonte lifetime. Se 
calculó la razón de costo-utilidad incremental que condujo al análisis de 
incertidumbre determinístico y probabilístico.
RESULTADOS: Se seleccionaron 22 artículos como fuentes de referencia. Incorporar 
el procedimiento al alero del régimen, implicaría beneficiarse de 9,8 años de 
vida ajustados por calidad versus 2,4 en el escenario sin acceso a cirugía. La 
razón de costo-utilidad incremental es menos $445 689 pesos chilenos por años de 
vida ajustados por calidad (menos 633,8 dólares americanos por años de vida 
ajustados por calidad), siendo la incorporación de cirugía de reemplazo al 
régimen una alternativa dominante, versus el escenario de acceso insuficiente en 
otros regímenes de cobertura. Cada año de vida ajustado por calidad gracias a la 
cirugía ahorrará $445 689 pesos chilenos. A una voluntad de pago de $502 596 
pesos chilenos por años de vida ajustados por calidad (714,7 dólares americanos 
por años de vida ajustados por calidad), la alternativa de acceso a reemplazo es 
costo-útil con 99,9% de certeza.
CONCLUSIÓN: El reemplazo total de rodilla en mayores de 65 años es una 
alternativa dominante. El acceso a cirugía en el régimen de Garantías Explícitas 
en Salud para el sistema público es costo-útil a un umbral de un producto 
interno bruto per cápita.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with 
osteoarthritis that undergo hip or knee arthroplasty jeopardize their life 
expectancy in Chile.
METHODS: A survival analysis study was designed and approved by our 
institutional ethics review board. Patients were included if they underwent 
surgery for hip or knee osteoarthritis and were 50 years or older at the time of 
surgery. Patients were excluded if arthroplasty was performed for fracture, 
hemophilia arthropathy, or tumor. A multiparametric Weibull regression was 
estimated, and the hazard ratio was reported. For internal validity, a bootstrap 
of 200 repetitions was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 4 094 arthroplasties were included. The Kaplan-Meier curve 
estimates a higher survival than the general population up to 12 years, after 
which the median survival is less than the general population. The bootstrap 
multiparametric Weibull regression estimated a hazard ratio of 1.53 (95% 
confidence interval: 1.27 to 1.84) for women, 1.09 (1.08 to 1.10) for every year 
older, and 1.29 (1.07 to 1.53) for hip arthroplasty patients.
CONCLUSION: Mortality after hip and knee arthroplasty in Chile follows a bimodal 
behavior similar to reports from the United States and Europe. At first, 
mortality is lower than the general population but worsens after 12 to 15 years 
of surgery.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: El propósito de este estudio es determinar si los 
pacientes con artrosis severa intervenidos con artroplastia de rodilla o cadera 
ponen en riesgo su expectativa de vida.
MÉTODO: Se diseñó un estudio de sobrevida el cual fue aprobado por el comité de 
ética de nuestra institución. Los pacientes fueron incluidos si fueron 
intervenidos de artroplastia de rodilla y cadera por artrosis severa y tenían 
más de 50 años. Los pacientes fueron excluidos si la artroplastia se realizó por 
fractura, hemofilia o un tumor. Una regresión multiparamétrica de Weibull fue 
estimada, siendo reportado el hazard ratio. Un bootstrap de 200 repeticiones fue 
realizada para validación interna.
RESULTADOS: Un total de 4094 artroplastias fueron incluidos. La curva de 
Kaplan-Meier estima una mayor sobrevida que la población general hasta los 12 
años, luego de lo cual la mediana de sobrevida es menor que la de la población 
general. La regresión multiparamétrica de Weibull estimó hazard ratios de 1,53 
(intervalo de confianza 95%: 1,27 a 1,84) en mujeres, de 1,09 (1,08 a 1,10) por 
cada año de edad y de 1,29 (1,07 a 1,53) en artroplastia de cadera.
CONCLUSIÓN: La mortalidad después de una intervención de artroplastia de rodilla 
o cadera sigue un comportamiento bimodal respecto a la población general similar 
a series reportadas en Estados Unidos y Suecia. Inicialmente la sobrevida es 
mayor que la población general, pero es menor luego de 12 a 15 años.

Cancer is responsible annually for around 27% of all deaths in Spain, 15% of 
which are caused by colorectal cancer. This malignancy has increased its 
incidence considerably over the past years, which surely impacts global 
productivity losses. The evaluation of lost productivity due to premature 
mortality provides valuable information that guides healthcare policies into the 
establishment of prevention and screening programs. The purpose of this study 
was to assess the productivity losses from premature deaths due to colorectal 
cancer over a ten year period (2008-2017). The costs derived from premature 
mortality due to this highly prevalent cancer were estimated using data on 
mortality, age- and sex-specific reference salaries and unemployment rates in 
Spain via the human capital approach. Between 2008 and 2017, 15,103 persons died 
per year from colorectal cancer, representing almost 15% of all cancer-related 
deaths. Annually, 25,333 years of potential productive life were estimated to be 
lost on average, 14,992 in males and 10,341 in females. Productivity losses 
summed €510.8 million in in 2017, and the cancers of the colon and rectum 
accounted for 9.6% of cancer-related productivity losses in 2017 in Spain. 
Colorectal cancer has an important weight in terms of productivity losses within 
the Spanish population, consequently, prevention and early detection programmes 
should be promoted and implemented to achieve significant reductions in 
mortality and productivity losses.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among 
aging factors using the new Japanese elderly standard, early postoperative 
physical function, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer. [Participants and Methods] We studied 94 patients 
scheduled for elective surgery of gastrointestinal cancer: 53 males and 41 
females aged 62.0 ± 12.1 years (mean ± SD). Patients were divided into three 
groups based on age at baseline: young (<65 years), pre-old (65-74 years), and 
old (≥75 years) groups. We measured body mass index, isometric knee extension 
force (IKEF), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey 
version 2 (SF-36) at baseline and 4 weeks after surgery. [Results] Patients 
75 years or older had significantly lower IKEF and 6MWT compared to the other 
groups. Patients younger than 65 years had significantly greater scores on the 
mental health SF36 subscale 4 weeks after surgery compared to baseline. 
Comparatively, patients older than 75 years had significantly decreased mental 
health scores 4 weeks after surgery. [Conclusion] Based on the new Japanese 
elderly standard, advanced age appears to worsen the postoperative change of 
HRQOL in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

Unraveling Targetable Systemic and Cell-Type-Specific Molecular Phenotypes of 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Brains With Digital Cytometry.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common 
neurodegenerative disorders worldwide, with age being their major risk factor. 
The increasing worldwide life expectancy, together with the scarcity of 
available treatment choices, makes it thus pressing to find the molecular basis 
of AD and PD so that the causing mechanisms can be targeted. To study these 
mechanisms, gene expression profiles have been compared between diseased and 
control brain tissues. However, this approach is limited by mRNA expression 
profiles derived for brain tissues highly reflecting their degeneration in 
cellular composition but not necessarily disease-related molecular states. We 
therefore propose to account for cell type composition when comparing 
transcriptomes of healthy and diseased brain samples, so that the loss of 
neurons can be decoupled from pathology-associated molecular effects. This 
approach allowed us to identify genes and pathways putatively altered 
systemically and in a cell-type-dependent manner in AD and PD brains. Moreover, 
using chemical perturbagen data, we computationally identified candidate small 
molecules for specifically targeting the profiled AD/PD-associated molecular 
alterations. Our approach therefore not only brings new insights into the 
disease-specific and common molecular etiologies of AD and PD but also, in these 
realms, foster the discovery of more specific targets for functional and 
therapeutic exploration.

COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare systems across the globe with an 
unprecedented surge in the demand for hospitalizations. Consequently, many 
hospitals are facing precarious conditions due to limited capacity, especially 
in the provision of ventilators. The governing ethical principles of medical 
practice delineated in (1) favor prioritizing younger patients, largely because 
of their relatively higher expected life years. We conduct a survey of the 
general public in the United States to elicit their preferences for the 
allocation of a limited number of ventilators. The results show that the general 
public views align with the established ethical principles, which favor younger 
patients. JEL Classification: C91.

Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Abortion and Euthanasia Among Health Students in 
Papua New Guinea.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore knowledge and attitudes of 
health program students towards ethical issues pertaining to the beginning and 
the end of human life, and associations between these attitudes and demographic 
variables.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The study took a mixed-method approach with 
self-administered survey questionnaires and in-depth interviews. A total of 88 
students participated in the survey, and 10 students participated in interviews. 
The study was conducted among students in the Health Extension Program at a 
Christian university in Papua New Guinea.
RESULTS: Students showed a higher acceptance of abortion than euthanasia. More 
year-4 students presented significantly deeper knowledge of euthanasia and 
abortion compared to year-1 students. There were no gender differences regarding 
knowledge and attitude towards these two bioethical issues. The majority of 
students opposed the idea of women's right to abortion, which is attributed 
mainly to socio-cultural reasons. The qualitative analysis indicated a very 
strong perception that having children 'defines' womanhood and also revealed 
general disapproval of any form of euthanasia. A low level of acceptance of 
various forms of euthanasia is associated with a respect for older people in 
Melanesian society and beliefs that ancestors' support is required for achieving 
prosperity in life.
CONCLUSION: The study offered a comprehensive description and analysis of 
students' knowledge and attitudes towards ethical issues pertaining to the 
beginning and the end of human life. Presented a low level of knowledge towards 
bioethical issues, together with a small proportion of the knowledge gained from 
lectures and tutorials, indicated inadequate teaching of bioethics and calls for 
further improvement. In the perspective of rapid social and cultural changes in

Cushing's disease (CD) is a serious endocrine disorder characterized by chronic 
hypercortisolism, or Cushing's syndrome (CS), caused by a corticotroph pituitary 
tumor, which induces an excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and 
consequently cortisol secretion. CD presents a severe clinical burden, with 
impairment of the quality of life and increase in mortality. Pituitary surgery 
represents the first-line therapy, but it is non-curative in one third of 
patients, requiring additional treatments. Among second-line treatments, medical 
therapy is gradually gaining importance, although the current medical treatments 
are unable to reach optimal efficacy and safety profile. Therefore, new drugs 
and new formulations of presently available drugs are currently under clinical 
investigation in international clinical trials, in order to assess their 
efficacy and safety in CD, or in the general population of CS. Among 
pituitary-directed agents, pasireotide, in the twice-daily subcutaneous 
formulation, has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment both in clinical 
trials and in real-world studies, and extension studies of the phase II and III 
clinical trials reported evidence of long-term efficacy with general good safety
