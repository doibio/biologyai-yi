Tyrosinases belong to the type-III copper enzyme family, which is involved in 
melanin production in a wide range of organisms. Despite similar overall 
characteristics and functions, their structures, activities, substrate 
specificities and regulation vary. The tyrosinase from the bacterium 
Verrucomicrobium spinosum (vsTyr) is produced as a pre-pro-enzyme in which a 
C-terminal extension serves as an inactivation domain. It does not require a 
caddie protein for copper ion incorporation, which makes it similar to 
eukaryotic tyrosinases. To gain an understanding of the catalytic machinery and 
regulation of vsTyr activity, we determined the structure of the catalytically 
active "core domain" of vsTyr by X-ray crystallography. The analysis showed that 
vsTyr is an atypical bacterial tyrosinase not only because it is independent of 
a caddie protein but also because it shows the highest structural (and sequence) 
similarity to plant-derived members of the type-III copper enzyme family and is 
more closely related to fungal tyrosinases regarding active site features. By 
modelling the structure of the pre-pro-enzyme using AlphaFold, we observed that 
Phe453, located in the C-terminal extension, is appropriately positioned to 
function as a "gatekeeper" residue. Our findings raise questions concerning the 
evolutionary origin of vsTyr.

The goal of this narrative review is to highlight the healthcare challenges 
faced by adults with cerebral palsy, including the management of long-term motor 
deficits, difficulty finding clinicians with expertise in these long-term 
impairments, and scarcity of rehabilitation options. Additionally, this 
narrative review seeks to examine potential methods for maintaining functional 
independence, promoting social integration, and community participation. 
Although the brain lesion that causes the movement disorder is non-progressive, 
the neurodevelopmental disorder worsens from secondary complications of existing 
sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Therefore, maintaining the continuum 
of care across one's lifespan is of utmost importance. Advancements in 
healthcare services over the past decade have resulted in lower mortality rates 
and increased the average life expectancy of people with cerebral palsy. 
However, once they transition from adolescence to adulthood, limited federal and 
community resources, and health care professionals' lack of expertise present 
significant obstacles to achieving quality healthcare and long-term benefits. 
This paper highlights the common impairments seen in adults with cerebral palsy. 
Additionally, it underscores the critical role of long-term healthcare and 
management to prevent functional decline and enhance quality of life across 
physical, cognitive, and social domains.

More efficient livestock production systems are necessary, considering that only 
41% of global meat demand will be met by 2050. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic 
crisis has clearly illustrated the necessity of building sustainable and stable 
agri-food systems. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) offers the continuous 
capacity of agriculture to contribute to overall human and animal welfare by 
providing sufficient goods and services through the application of technical 
innovations like digitalization. However, adopting new technologies is a 
challenging issue for farmers, extension services, agri-business and 
policymakers. We present a review of operational concepts and technological 
solutions in the pig and poultry sectors, as reflected in 41 and 16 European 
projects from the last decade, respectively. The European trend of increasing 
broiler-meat production, which is soon to outpace pork, stresses the need for 
more outstanding research efforts in the poultry industry. We further present a 
review of farmers' attitudes and obstacles to the acceptance of technological 
solutions in the pig and poultry sectors using examples and lessons learned from 
recent European projects. Despite the low resonance at the research level, the 
investigation of farmers' attitudes and concerns regarding the acceptance of 
technological solutions in the livestock sector should be incorporated into any 
technological development.

Background: Despite obtaining a good prognosis and long life expectancy, 
survivors of thyroid cancer can nevertheless develop subsequent primary cancer 
(SPC). We investigated the risk and types of SPC in patients with thyroid cancer 
and compared them with subjects without thyroid cancer history (controls). 
Methods: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study 
based on the Korean National Health Insurance Database. A total of 432,654 
patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 2004 and 2019 were 1:1 matched 
with controls for age, sex, income, and region of residence. The hazard ratios 
(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of SPC were estimated using Cox 
proportional hazard models. Results: In total, 78,584 (18.2%) patients with 
thyroid cancer and 49,979 (11.6%) controls were diagnosed with SPCs over a mean 
follow-up of 6.9 years. Patients with thyroid cancer had a higher risk of SPC at 
any site (adjusted HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.60-1.64) than the controls. The risk of 
SPCs was particularly high for patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer at a 
younger age (<40 years) and within 5 years. Conclusions: Medical caregivers 
should consider the long-term follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer and 
discuss the risk of SPC, especially if they complain of cancer-related symptoms.

As Taiwan's population ages, the need for long-term care, such as home care, is 
increasing due to improved medical services and longer life expectancy; however, 
the current coverage rate for home care services is only 50%, highlighting the 
importance of retaining home care workers. This study applies job embeddedness, 
organizational commitment, and psychological safety as variables to explore the 
retention intention of Taiwan's home care workers. A questionnaire survey was 
distributed among home care workers using convenience sampling, resulting in 547 
collected questionnaires, of which 458 were valid. Data analysis was conducted 
with SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 22.0, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to 
test the hypotheses. Our findings suggest that job embeddedness has a positive 
impact on organizational commitment (γ = 0.649, γ = 0.607, and γ = 0.628; p < 
0.001) and retention intention (γ = 0.253, γ = 0.242, γ = 0.271; p < 0.001), 
similar to organizational commitment (γ = 0.721, p < 0.001). Additionally, 
organizational commitment mediates job embeddedness and retention intention, 
while psychological safety moderated organizational commitment and retention 
intention (β = 0.639; p < 0.001). This study aims to provide information for the 
development of more effective human resource policies and contribute to 
practical advancements in the home care service environment and management 
structure of home care organizations. By analyzing and exploring the main 
factors contributing to home care workers' retention intention, we hope to 
enhance the overall benefits of home service organizations and the industry.

Animal studies have proven that 1-acetyl-5-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl acetate (APPA) 
is a powerful antioxidant as a novel aldose reductase inhibitor independently 
synthesized by our laboratory; however, there is no current information on 
APPA's anti-aging mechanism. Therefore, this study examined the impact and 
mechanism of APPA's anti-aging and anti-oxidation capacity using the 
Caenorhabditis elegans model. The results demonstrated that APPA increases C. 
elegans' longevity without affecting the typical metabolism of Escherichia coli 
OP50 (OP50). APPA also had a non-toxic effect on C. elegans, increased locomotor 
ability, decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species, lipofuscin, and fat, 
and increased anti-stress capacity. QRT-PCR analysis further revealed that APPA 
upregulated the expression of antioxidant genes, including sod-3, gst-4, and 
hsp-16.2, and the critical downstream transcription factors, daf-16, skn-1, and 
hsf-1 of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor, daf-2. In 
addition, fat-6 and nhr-80 were upregulated. However, the APPA's life-prolonging 
effects were absent on the daf-2, daf-16, skn-1, and hsf-1 mutants implying that 
the APPA's life-prolonging mechanism depends on the insulin/IGF-1 signaling 
system. The transcriptome sequencing also revealed that the mitochondrial route 
was also strongly associated with the APPA life extension, consistent with mev-1 
and isp-1 mutant life assays. These findings aid in the investigation of APPA's 
longevity extension mechanism.

T-cadherin is a regulator of blood vessel remodeling and angiogenesis, involved 
in adiponectin-mediated protective effects in the cardiovascular system and in 
skeletal muscles. GWAS study has previously demonstrated a SNP in the Cdh13 gene 
to be associated with hypertension. However, the role of T-cadherin in 
regulating blood pressure has not been experimentally elucidated. Herein, we 
generated Cdh13∆Exon3 mice lacking exon 3 in the Cdh13 gene and described their 
phenotype. Cdh13∆Exon3 mice exhibited normal gross morphology, life expectancy, 
and breeding capacity. Meanwhile, their body weight was considerably lower than 
of WT mice. When running on a treadmill, the time spent running and the distance 
covered by Cdh13∆Exon3 mice was similar to that of WT. The resting blood 
pressure in Cdh13∆Exon3 mice was slightly higher than in WT, however, upon 
intensive physical training their systolic blood pressure was significantly 
elevated. While adiponectin content in the myocardium of Cdh13∆Exon3 and WT mice 
was within the same range, adiponectin plasma level was 4.37-fold higher in 
Cdh13∆Exon3 mice. Moreover, intensive physical training augmented the AMPK 
phosphorylation in the skeletal muscles and myocardium of Cdh13∆Exon3 mice as 
compared to WT. Our data highlight a critically important role of T-cadherin in 
regulation of blood pressure and stamina in mice, and may shed light on the 
pathogenesis of hypertension.

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are complex, multifactorial disorders with 
significant social and economic impact in today's society. NDDs are predicted to 
become the second-most common cause of death in the next few decades due to an 
increase in life expectancy but also to a lack of early diagnosis and mainly 
symptomatic treatment. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic 
methods, there are yet no reliable biomarkers identifying the complex pathways 
contributing to these pathologies. The development of new approaches for early 
diagnosis and new therapies, together with the identification of non-invasive 
and more cost-effective diagnostic biomarkers, is one of the main trends in NDD 
biomedical research. Here we summarize data on peripheral biomarkers, biofluids 
(cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma), and peripheral blood cells (platelets 
(PLTs) and red blood cells (RBCs)), reported so far for the three most common 
NDDs-Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS). PLTs and RBCs, beyond their primary physiological functions, 
are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of biomarkers for NDDs. Special 
attention is given to the morphological and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs 
and RBCs as biophysical markers for the three pathologies. Modifications of the 
surface nanostructure and morphometric and nanomechanical signatures of PLTs and 
RBCs from patients with AD, PD, and ALS have been revealed by atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). AFM is currently experiencing rapid and widespread adoption in 
biomedicine and clinical medicine, in particular for early diagnostics of 
various medical conditions. AFM is a unique instrument without an analog, 
allowing the generation of three-dimensional cell images with extremely high 
spatial resolution at near-atomic scale, which are complemented by insights into 
the mechanical properties of cells and subcellular structures. Data demonstrate 
that AFM can distinguish between the three pathologies and the normal, healthy 
state. The specific PLT and RBC signatures can serve as biomarkers in 
combination with the currently used diagnostic tools. We highlight the strong 
correlation of the morphological and nanomechanical signatures between RBCs and 
PLTs in PD, ALS, and AD.

Axon regeneration is essential for successful recovery after peripheral nerve 
injury. Although growth cone reformation and axonal extension are crucial steps 
in axonal regeneration, the regulatory mechanisms underlying these dynamic 
processes are poorly understood. Here, we identify βPix (Arhgef7), the guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 GTPase, as a regulator of axonal 
regeneration. After sciatic nerve injury in mice, the expression levels of βPix 
increase significantly in nerve segments containing regenerating axons. In 
regrowing axons, βPix is localized in the peripheral domain of the growth cone. 
Using βPix neuronal isoform knockout (NIKO) mice in which the neuronal isoforms 
of βPix are specifically removed, we demonstrate that βPix promotes neurite 
outgrowth in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons and in vivo axon regeneration 
after sciatic nerve crush injury. Activation of cJun and STAT3 in the cell 
bodies is not affected in βPix NIKO mice, supporting the local action of βPix in 
regenerating axons. Finally, inhibiting Src, a kinase previously identified as 
an activator of the βPix neuronal isoform, causes axon outgrowth defects in 
vitro, like those found in the βPix NIKO neurons. Altogether, these data 
indicate that βPix plays an important role in axonal regrowth during peripheral 
nerve regeneration.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) still persist despite improved 
life expectancy, reduced viral loads, and decreased infection severity. The 
number of patients affected by HANDs ranges from (30 to 50) % of HIV-infected 
individuals. The pathological mechanisms contributing to HANDs and the most 
serious manifestation of the disease, HIV-associated dementia (HAD), are not yet 
well understood. Evidence suggests that these mechanisms are likely 
multifactorial, producing neurocognitive complications involving disorders such 
as neurogenesis, autophagy, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. 
Over the years, multiple pharmacological approaches with specific mechanisms of 
action acting upon distinct targets have been approved. Although these therapies 
are effective in reducing viral loading to undetectable levels, they also 
present some disadvantages such as common side effects, the need for 
administration with a very high frequency, and the possibility of drug 
resistance. Genetic studies on HANDs provide insights into the biological 
pathways and mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment in people living 
with HIV-1. Furthermore, they also help identify genetic variants that increase 
susceptibility to HANDs and can be used to tailor treatment approaches for HIV-1 
patients. Identification of the genetic markers associated with disease 
progression can help clinicians predict which individuals require more 
aggressive management and by understanding the genetic basis of the disorder, it 
will be possible to develop targeted therapies to mitigate cognitive impairment. 
The main goal of this review is to provide details on the epidemiological data 
currently available and to summarise the genetic (specifically, the genetic 
makeup of the immune system), transcriptomic, and epigenetic studies available 
on HANDs to date. In addition, we address the potential pharmacological 
therapeutic strategies currently being investigated. This will provide valuable 
information that can guide clinical care, drug development, and our overall 
understanding of these diseases.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is still a life-threatening disease with frequent 
lethal outcomes despite the profound changes in its clinical, microbiological, 
imaging, and therapeutic profiles. Nowadays, the scenario for IE has changed 
since rheumatic fever has declined, but on the other hand, multiple aspects, 
such as elderly populations, cardiovascular device implantation procedures, and 
better use of multiple imaging modalities and multidisciplinary care, have 
increased, leading to escalations in diagnosis. Since the ESC and AHA Guidelines 
have been released, specific aspects of diagnostic and therapeutic management 
have been clarified to provide better and faster diagnosis and prognosis. 
Surgical treatment is required in approximately half of patients with IE in 
order to avoid progressive heart failure, irreversible structural damage in the 
case of uncontrolled infection, and the prevention of embolism. The timing of 
surgery has been one of the main aspects discussed, identifying cases in which 
surgery needs to be performed on an emergency (within 24 h) or urgent (within 7 
days) basis, irrespective of the duration of antibiotic treatment, or cases 
where surgery can be postponed to allow a brief period of antibiotic treatment 
under careful clinical and echocardiographic observation. Mainly, guidelines put 
emphasis on the importance of an endocarditis team in the handling of systemic 
complications and how they affect the timing of surgery and perioperative 
management. Neurological complications, acute renal failure, splenic or 
musculoskeletal manifestations, or infections determined by multiresistant 
microorganisms or fungi can affect long-term prognosis and survival. Not to be 
outdone, anatomical and surgical factors, such as the presence of native or 
prosthetic valve endocarditis, a repair strategy when feasible, anatomical 
extension and disruption in the case of an annular abscess (mitral valve 
annulus, aortic mitral curtain, aortic root, and annulus), and the choice of 
prosthesis and conduits, can be equally crucial. It can be hard for surgeons to 
maneuver between correct pre-operative planning and facing unexpected obstacles 
during intraoperative management. The aim of this review is to provide an 
overview and analysis of a broad spectrum of specific surgical scenarios and how 
their challenging management can be essential to ensure better outcomes and 
prognoses.

Low back pain (LBP), a globally widespread and persistent musculoskeletal 
disorder, benefits from exercise therapy. However, it remains unclear which type 
leads to greater changes in paraspinal muscle health. This study aimed to (1) 
compare the effects of a combined motor control and isolated lumbar extension 
exercise (MC+ILEX) versus a general exercise (GE) intervention on paraspinal 
muscle morphology, composition, and function, and (2) examine whether 
alterations in paraspinal muscle health were correlated with improvements in 
pain, function, and quality of life. Fifty participants with chronic LBP were 
randomly assigned to each group and underwent a 12-week supervised intervention 
program. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound assessments were acquired at 
baseline, 6 and 12 weeks to examine the impact of each intervention on erector 
spinae (ES) and multifidus (MF) muscle size (cross-sectional area, CSA), 
composition, and function at L4-L5 and L5-S1. Self-reported questionnaires were 
also acquired to assess participant-oriented outcomes. Our findings indicated 
that the MC+ILEX group demonstrated greater improvements in MF and ES CSA, along 
with MF thickness at both levels (all p < 0.01). Both groups significantly 
improved in pain, function, and quality of life. This study provided preliminary 
results suggesting that an MC+ILEX intervention may improve paraspinal 
morphology while decreasing pain and disability.

BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer is frequent and often treated with sphincter-saving 
procedures that may cause LARS, a syndrome characterized by symptoms of bowel 
disfunction that may severely affect quality of life. LARS is common, but its 
pathogenesis is mostly unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence 
of LARS and to identify potential risk factors.
METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective single center analysis. The 
following data were collected and analyzed for each patient: demographics, 
tumor-related data, and intra- and peri-operative data. Statistical analysis was 
conducted, including descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression 
to identify independent risk factors.
RESULTS: Total LARS incidence was 31%. Statistically significant differences 
were found in tumor distance from anal verge, tumor extension (pT and diameter) 
and tumor grading (G). Multivariate analysis identified tumor distance from anal 
verge and tumor extension as an independent predictive factor for both major and 
total LARS. Adjuvant therapy, although not significant at univariate analysis, 
was identified as an independent predictive factor. Time to stoma closure within 
10 weeks seems to reduce incidence of major LARS.
CONCLUSIONS: bold LARS affects a considerable portion of patients. This study 
identified potential predictive factors that could be useful to identify high 
risk patients for LARS.

An improved recognition of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) is associated with an 
increase in life expectancy and a higher incidence of complications and related 
conditions. The aim of the study was to analyze factors enabling the primary 
prevention: BMI, smoking and selected laboratory tests (morphology with smear, 
creatinine, eGFR, total protein, albumin, ferritin, folic acid, vitamin B12, 
vitamin D3) included in the protocols of standard of care for adult patients 
with primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). The study included 94 participants ≥ 
18 years old, diagnosed with PADs. Overweight was found in 17%, obesity in 14% 
and underweight in 15% of patients; 11.5% of patients smoked. Leukopenia was 
diagnosed in 16%, neutropenia in 8.5%, lymphopenia in 22.5% and thrombocytopenia 
in 14% of patients. A decreased concentration of hemoglobin was found in 32%, 
total protein in 19%, albumin in 17%, vitamin D3 in 52%, vitamin B12 in 6.5%, 
folic acid in 34% and ferritin in 26% of patients. Creatinine concentrations 
were elevated in 16% of patients, while in 20%, eGFR was reduced. Only a 
holistic assessment of comorbidities and complications of deficiency, as well as 
regular follow-up and lifestyle changes, can yield the best results in the 
long-term care of patients.

Glioblastoma (GB) is a malignant glioma associated with a mean overall survival 
of 12 to 18 months, even with optimal treatment, due to its high relapse rate 
and treatment resistance. The standardized first-line treatment consists of 
surgery, which allows for diagnosis and cytoreduction, followed by stereotactic 
fractionated radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Treatment failure can result from 
the poor passage of drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The development 
of novel and more effective therapeutic approaches is paramount to increasing 
the life expectancy of GB patients. Nanoparticle-based treatments include 
epitopes that are designed to interact with specialized transport systems, 
ultimately allowing the crossing of the BBB, increasing therapeutic efficacy, 
and reducing systemic toxicity and drug degradation. Polymeric nanoparticles 
have shown promising results in terms of precisely directing drugs to the brain 
with minimal systemic side effects. Various methods of drug delivery that pass 
through the BBB, such as the stereotactic injection of nanoparticles, are being 
actively tested in vitro and in vivo in animal models. A significant variety of 
pre-clinical studies with polymeric nanoparticles for the treatment of GB are 
being conducted, with only a few nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to 
date having entered clinical trials. Pre-clinical studies are key to testing the 
safety and efficacy of these novel anticancer therapies and will hopefully 
facilitate the testing of the clinical validity of this promising treatment 
method. Here we review the recent literature concerning the most frequently 
reported types of nanoparticles for the treatment of GB.

As a result of social progress and improved living conditions, which have 
contributed to a prolonged life expectancy, the prevalence of strokes has 
increased and has become a significant phenomenon. Despite the available stroke 
treatment options, patients frequently suffer from significant disability after 
a stroke. Initial stroke severity is a significant predictor of functional 
dependence and mortality following an acute stroke. The current study aims to 
collect and analyze data from the hyperacute and acute phases of stroke, as well 
as from the medical history of the patients, in order to develop an explainable 
machine learning model for predicting stroke-related neurological deficits at 
discharge, as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS). More specifically, we approached the data as a binary task problem: 
improvement of NIHSS progression vs. worsening of NIHSS progression at 
discharge, using baseline data within the first 72 h. For feature selection, a 
genetic algorithm was applied. Using various classifiers, we found that the best 
scores were achieved from the Random Forest (RF) classifier at the 15 most 
informative biomarkers and parameters for the binary task of the prediction of 
NIHSS score progression. RF achieved 91.13% accuracy, 91.13% recall, 90.89% 
precision, 91.00% f1-score, 8.87% FNrate and 4.59% FPrate. Those biomarkers are: 
age, gender, NIHSS upon admission, intubation, history of hypertension and 
smoking, the initial diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and 
atrial fibrillation, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, stroke localization, 
systolic blood pressure levels, as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 
levels upon admission and the onset of respiratory infection. The SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model interpreted the impact of the selected 
features on the model output. Our findings suggest that the aforementioned 
variables may play a significant role in determining stroke patients' NIHSS 
progression from the time of admission until their discharge.

For decades, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been one of the most 
prevalent and mortal cancers worldwide. The gold standard for OSCC diagnosis is 
still histopathology but this narrative multidisciplinary review has the aim to 
explore the literature about conventional OSCC prognostic indicators related to 
the pTNM stage at the diagnosis such as the depth of invasion and the 
lymphovascular invasion associated with distant metastasis as indicators of poor 
life expectancy. Despite its multifactorial nature and recognizable precursors, 
its diagnosis at the early stages is still challenging. We wanted to highlight 
the importance of the screening as a primary weapon that a stomatologist should 
consider, intercepting all at-risk conditions and lesions associated with OSCC 
and its early stages. This narrative review also overviews the most promising 
imaging techniques, such as CT, MRI, and US-echography, and their application 
related to clinical and surgical practice, but also the most-investigated 
prognostic and diagnostic tissue and salivary biomarkers helpful in OSCC 
diagnosis and prognostic assessment. Our work highlighted remarkable potential 
biomarkers that could have a leading role in the future. However, we are still 
far from defining an appropriate and concrete protocol to apply in clinical 
practice. The hope is that the present and future research will overcome these 
limitations to benefit patients, clinicians, and welfare.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in progressive multi-organ 
manifestations with predominance in the respiratory and gastrointestinal 
systems. The significant morbidity and mortality seen in the CF population has 
been the driving force urging the CF research community to further advance 
treatments to slow disease progression and, in turn, prolong life expectancy. 
Enormous strides in medical advancements have translated to improvement in 
quality of life, symptom burden, and survival; however, there is still no cure. 
This review discusses the most current mainstay treatments and anticipated 
therapeutics in the CF drug development pipeline within the mechanisms of 
mucociliary clearance, anti-inflammatory and anti-infective therapies, 
restoration of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
protein (also known as highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT)), and genetic 
therapies. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapy, gene transfer, and gene editing are 
being explored in the hopes of developing a treatment and potential cure for 
people with CF, particularly for those not responsive to HEMT.

Cracks in reinforced concrete structures can accelerate the local depassivation 
of reinforcement due to carbonation. Different approaches have been proposed to 
account for pre-existing cracks within engineering models to predict the 
carbonation depth. In this study, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of 
different extensions available for the fib carbonation model to account for 
cracks, viz., crack influence factor (CIF) approaches, a diffusion-based model 
and the crack depth adaption. The model extensions are first validated against a 
dataset of lab data collected from the literature and additional experiments 
performed as the part of this study. The CIF approaches achieved the highest 
accuracy for the carbonation depth prediction when compared against lab data. 
The diffusion-based model was inaccurate for low CO2 concentrations. The crack 
depth adaption provides overly conservative results. No model was found to be 
best performing, and large scatter was observed between predicted and 
experimental values. This emphasizes the need for more detailed 
multi-physics-based models to achieve accurate predictions. For further 
comparison, service life predictions were conducted for two structural scales, 
viz., the whole structure and the cracked area. It is concluded that the choice 
of model extension and the structural scale of analysis have a large influence 
on predicted probability of failure.

Increased life expectancy in industrialized countries is causing an increased 
incidence of osteoporosis and the need for bioactive bone implants. The 
integration of implants can be improved physically, but mainly by chemical 
modifications of the material surface. It was recognized that 
amino-group-containing coatings improved cell attachment and intracellular 
signaling. The aim of this study was to determine the role of the amino group 
density in this positive cell behavior by developing controlled amino-rich 
nanolayers. This work used covalent grafting of polymer-based nanocoatings with 
different amino group densities. Titanium coated with the positively-charged 
trimethoxysilylpropyl modified poly(ethyleneimine) (Ti-TMS-PEI), which mostly 
improved cell area after 30 min, possessed the highest amino group density with 
an N/C of 32%. Interestingly, changes in adhesion-related genes on Ti-TMS-PEI 
could be seen after 4 h. The mRNA microarray data showed a premature transition 
of the MG-63 cells into the beginning differentiation phase after 24 h 
indicating Ti-TMS-PEI as a supportive factor for osseointegration. This 
amino-rich nanolayer also induced higher bovine serum albumin protein adsorption 
and caused the cells to migrate slower on the surface after a more extended 
period of cell settlement as an indication of a better surface anchorage. In 
conclusion, the cell spreading on amine-based nanocoatings correlated well with 
the amino group density (N/C).

In recent years, the determination of the antioxidant and antibacterial activity 
of essential oils in wild plants, such as Mexican oregano (Lippia graveolens 
Kunth), has become increasingly important. The objective was to compare the 
antioxidant and antibacterial activity of Mexican oregano essential oil obtained 
from plants occurring naturally in semiarid areas (Wild1 and Wild2), and those 
cultivated in the field (CField) and greenhouse (CGreenhouse) in northern 
Mexico. The Mexican oregano essential oil extraction was performed using the 
hydrodistillation method, the antioxidant activity was determined using the ABTS 
method, and the antibacterial activity was assessed through bioassays under the 
microwell method at nine different concentrations. The aim was to determine the 
diameter of the inhibition zone and, consequently, understand the sensitivity 
level for four bacterial species. The results revealed an antioxidant activity 
ranging from 90% to 94% at the sampling sites, with Wild1 standing out for 
having the highest average antioxidant activity values. Likewise, six out of the 
nine concentrations analyzed showed some degree of sensitivity for all the 
sampling sites. In this regard, the 25 µL mL-1 concentration showed the highest 
diameter of inhibition zone values, highlighting the Wild2 site, which showed an 
average diameter greater than 30 mm for the four bacteria tested. Only in the 
case of S. typhi did the CGreenhouse site surpass the Wild2, with an average 
diameter of the inhibition zone of 36.7 mm. These findings contribute to the 
search for new antioxidant and antibacterial options, addressing the challenges 
that humanity faces in the quest for opportunities to increase life expectancy.
