repertoire of robust and high-affinity antihuman serum albumin nanobodies 
(NbHSA) that can be readily fused to small biologics for half-life extension. We 
characterized the thermostability, binding kinetics, and cross-species 
reactivity of NbHSAs, mapped their epitopes, and structurally resolved a 
tetrameric HSA-Nb complex. We parallelly determined the half-lives of a cohort 
of selected NbHSAs in an HSA mouse model by quantitative proteomics. Compared to 
short-lived control nanobodies, the half-lives of NbHSAs were drastically 
prolonged by 771-fold. NbHSAs have distinct and diverse pharmacokinetics, 
positively correlating with their albumin binding affinities at the endosomal 
pH. We then generated stable and highly bioactive NbHSA-cytokine fusion 
constructs "Duraleukin" and demonstrated Duraleukin's high preclinical efficacy 
for cancer treatment in a melanoma model. This high-quality and versatile Nb 
toolkit will help tailor drug half-life to specific medical needs.

OBJECTIVE: The number of teeth has been shown to affect mortality. However, it 
is unclear why the number of teeth is associated with mortality. We focused on 
the number of teeth and malnutrition and examined whether these differences 
affect 3-year all-cause mortality among very elderly individuals.
METHODS: This analysis was conducted using data from the Tokyo Oldest Old Survey 
on Total Health study. Altogether 513 participants ≥85 years were categorized 
based on remaining teeth (0, 1-7, 8-18, ≥19). All-cause mortality was determined 
by calculating the cumulative 3-year survival rate according to the remaining 
number of teeth and the presence/absence of malnutrition. Further, hazard ratios 
(HRs) were analyzed using Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: No difference was observed according to the number of teeth (p = 
0.638), but the presence/absence of malnutrition was significantly associated 
with mortality (p < 0.001). Malnutrition was independently associated with 
higher HRs, even after adjusting for confounding factors associated with 
mortality. (HR: 2.315, 95% CI: 1.431-3.746). Additionally, adjusting for the 
number of teeth, HR remained significant (HR: 2.365, 95% CI: 1.449-3.853).
CONCLUSION: In the very elderly, malnutrition-but not the number of teeth-was 
independently associated with 3-year all-cause mortality after adjusting for 
various health issues.

Financial analysis of PA lifetime earnings and debt.

Bruza-Augatis M(1), Hooker RS, Coombs JM.

Author information:
(1)Mirela Bruza-Augatis is assistant chair and an assistant professor in the PA 
program at Seton Hall University in Nutley, N.J. Roderick S. Hooker is a health 
policy analyst. Jennifer M. Coombs is an associate professor in the PA program 
at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The authors have disclosed no 
potential conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise.

This economic analysis of physician assistant/associate (PA) career earnings 
sought to assess the increasing effect of student debt, its potential effect on 
job selection, and whether such financial obligations may influence graduates to 
select higher-paying specialties. The model was a 30-year-old newly graduated PA 
who begins working in family medicine. A simulation included wages, student 
debt, national household expenditures, and real estate statistics. The scenario 
consisted of a high and middle cost of living in two geographic areas, a family 
of four, and an average life expectancy. Using a validated economic program, a 
series of calculations produced the financial effect on moderateincome levels 
and expenditures based on median PA earnings. On the deficit side is education 
debt, loan repayment, financing a house, college for children, retirement, and 
discretionary spending. Weighted variables were used to maximize the sensitivity 
effect of the simulation. A Monte Carlo probabilistic program predicted the 
likely outcome of income, expenses, inflation, and investments. Furthermore, the 
lifetime earnings of a PA who retires at age 67 years and lives to age 85 years 
falls in the 75th percentile of income of all Americans. The conclusion is that 
a full-time PA career in any clinical role is as economically rewarding as it is 
satisfying.

The updated listing criteria for heart transplantation are presented on behalf 
of the three heart transplant centres in the Netherlands. Given the shortage of 
donor hearts, selection of those patients who may expect to have the greatest 
benefit from a scarce societal resource in terms of life expectancy and quality 
of life is inevitable. The indication for heart transplantation includes 
end-stage heart disease not remediable by more conservative measures, 
accompanied by severe physical limitation while on optimal medical therapy, 
including ICD/CRT‑D. Assessment of this condition requires cardiopulmonary 
stress testing, prognostic stratification and invasive haemodynamic 
measurements. Timely referral to a tertiary centre is essential for an optimal 
outcome. Chronic mechanical circulatory support is being used more and more as 
an alternative to heart transplantation and to bridge the progressively longer 
waiting time for heart transplantation and, thus, has become an important 
treatment option for patients with advanced heart failure.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether poor hip range 
of motion (ROM) and strength predict 12-month physical function decline among 
older adults with chronic low back pain (LBP) and whether hip osteoarthritis 
modifies those relationships.
METHODS: At baseline, passive ROM and strength measurements were taken for hip 
flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external 
rotation; ultrasound images and self-reported symptoms were used to evaluate hip 
osteoarthritis presence (eg, osteophytes and hip pain). At baseline and 12 
months, performance-based (repeated chair rise, self-selected gait speed, 
6-minute walk test [6MWT]) and self-reported (Quebec LBP Disability 
Questionnaire, Late-Life Function & Disability Instrument [LLFDI] basic and 
advanced lower extremity scales) physical function outcomes were assessed. 
Regression models were constructed for each outcome predicted by baseline hip 
ROM and strength measures, with adjustment for potential covariates. To avoid 
collinearity, hip ROM and strength measures with the strongest unadjusted 
correlations were included in final models. The hip osteoarthritis presence by 
hip ROM/strength interaction was also explored.
RESULTS: Hip abduction strength predicted repeated chair rise (β = -0.297, P < 
0.001), gait speed (β = 0.160, P = 0.003), 6MWT (β = 0.159, P ≤ 0.001), Quebec 
LBP Disability Questionnaire (β = -0.152, P = 0.003), and LLFDI basic lower 
extremity scale (β = 0.171, P = 0.005) outcomes. Regarding hip ROM, extension 
predicted repeated chair rise (β = -0.110, P = 0.043) and LLFDI advanced lower 
extremity scale (β = 0.090, P = 0.007) outcomes, external rotation predicted 
gait speed (β = 0.122, P = 0.004) outcomes, and abduction predicted LLFDI basic 
lower extremity scale (β = 0.114, P = 0.026) outcomes. The hip osteoarthritis 
interaction was not significant for any model.
CONCLUSION: Reduced hip strength and ROM predict physical function decline; hip 
osteoarthritis presence may not modify these relationships.

BACKGROUND: Invasive mold infections (IMI) directly impact life expectancy, 
especially with delayed therapy. Among IMI, aspergillosis (IA) is more common 
than mucormycosis (IM), resulting in IA-targeted empirical treatment with 
voriconazole for suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), despite IM 
ineffectiveness. Recently, isavuconazole was approved in Canada for IA and IM. 
The primary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole 
compared to voriconazole for suspected IPA in Canada. A secondary objective was 
to assess the impact of varying time horizons to address the wide spectrum of 
life expectancies, according to patients underlying diseases.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 5-year decision-tree was developed from the 
Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and societal perspectives. Efficacy parameters 
were extracted from SECURE/VITAL trials. Costs included treatment acquisition, 
hospitalization, adverse events and productivity loss. 3- and 10-year time 
horizon alternative scenarios and extensive sensitivity analyses were also 
conducted.
RESULTS: From a MoH perspective, isavuconazole compared to voriconazole resulted 
in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $C30,160/QALY. 3- and10-year 
ICURs were also cost-effective, relative to a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$C50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, in comparison to voriconazole, 
isavuconazole is a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of patients with 
suspected IPA, regardless of their life expectancy.

Rationale: Primary care clinicians may be well placed to play a greater role in 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management. Objectives: To evaluate the outcomes 
and cost-effectiveness of sleep apnea management in primary versus specialist 
care, using an individual-participant data meta-analysis to determine whether 
age, sex, severity of OSA, and daytime sleepiness impacted outcomes. Methods: 
Data sources were the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
(CINAHL) database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
MEDLINE Ovid SP, Scopus, ProQuest, U.S. National Institutes of Health Ongoing 
Trials Register, and ISRCTN registry (inception until 09-25-2019). Hand 
searching was undertaken. Two authors independently assessed articles and 
included trials that randomized adults with a suspected diagnosis of sleep apnea 
to primary versus specialist management within the same study and reported 
daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (range 0-24; >10 indicates 
pathological sleepiness; minimum clinically important difference 2 units) at 
baseline and follow-up. Results: The primary analysis combined data from 970 
(100%) participants (four trials). Risk of bias was assessed (Cochrane Tool). 
One-stage intention-to-treat analysis showed a slightly smaller decrease in 
daytime sleepiness (0.8; 0.2 to 1.4), but greater reduction in diastolic blood 
pressure in primary care (-1.9; -3.2 to -0.6 mm Hg), with similar findings in 
the per-protocol analysis. Primary care-based within-trial healthcare system 
costs per participant were lower (-$448.51 U.S.), and quality-adjusted life 
years and daytime sleepiness improvements were less expensive. Similar primary 
outcome results were obtained for subgroups in both management settings. 
Conclusions: Similar outcomes in primary care at a lower cost provide strong 
support for implementation of primary care-based management of sleep apnea.

Enhanced Recovery after Surgery: Perspective in Elder Women.

Australia.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal convention first reported 
for colorectal and gynecologic procedures. The main benefits have been a shorter 
length of stay and reduced complications, leading to improved clinical outcomes 
and cost savings substantially. With increase in life expectancy, recent years 
has shown a significant rise in advanced age population, and similarly, a rise 
in age-related disorders requiring surgical management. Due to 
pathophysiological and metabolic changes in geriatric age group with increased 
incidence of medical comorbidities, there is higher risk of enhanced surgical 
stress response with undesirable postoperative morbidity, complications, 
prolonged immobility, and extended convalescence. The feasibility and 
effectiveness of ERAS protocols have been well researched and documented among 
all age groups, including the geriatric high-risk population.[1] Adhering to 
ERAS protocols after colorectal surgery showed no significant difference in 
postoperative complications, hospital stay, or readmission rate among various 
age groups.[2] A recent report mentions the safety and benefits following ERAS 
guidelines with reduced length of stay in elderly patients with short-level 
lumbar fusion surgery.[3] The concept of prehabilitation has evolved as an 
integral part of ERAS to build up physiological reserve, especially in geriatric 
high-risk group, and to adapt better to surgical stress.[4] High levels of 
compliance with ERAS interventions combined with prehabilitation can be achieved 
when a dedicated multidisciplinary team is involved in care of these high-risk 
patients.

Secular Trends in the Epidemiologic Patterns of Thyroid Cancer in China Over 
Three Decades: An Updated Systematic Analysis of Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019 Data.

Changchun, China.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant endocrine disease 
worldwide. The changing epidemiologic pattern of thyroid cancer at the national 
level in China has remained unknown over the last three decades.
METHODS: Following the general analytical strategy used in the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) 2019, the age- and sex-specific incidence, mortality, and 
prevalence rates of thyroid cancer in China were analyzed. Trends in the 
incidence, mortality, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due 
to thyroid cancer from 1990 to 2019 were assessed by joinpoint regression 
analysis. Age, period, and cohort effects on incidence were estimated by an 
age-period-cohort model.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates 
significantly increased in both males and females, and the age-standardized 
mortality rate decreased in females but increased in males. Moreover, the 
increments in all the age-standardized measures of thyroid cancer in China were 
higher in males than in females. The age effect showed that those aged 40-44 
years had the highest relative risk (RR) among females, and the RR increased 
with age among males. The incidence increased with time and began to 
substantially increase in 2009. The cohort effect showed that the incidence 
decreased in successive birth cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of thyroid cancer in China showed unexpected patterns 
that varied by sex, age, and year. Notably, males had higher average annual 
percentage changes in thyroid cancer incidence and mortality rates than females. 
More attention should be given to improving the thyroid cancer burden in males 
in China.

Through RhizoPot.

Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a common challenge in crop production because of 
its poor mobility through the soil. The root system plays a significant role in 
P absorption from the soil and is the initial indicator of low P levels. 
However, the phenotypic dynamics and longevity of cotton roots under P stress 
remain unknown. In this study, RhizoPot, an improvised in situ root observation 
device, was used to monitor the dynamics of root phenotypes of cotton seedlings 
under P-deficient (PD) and P-replete (PR) conditions. Low P stress reduced P 
absorption and accumulation in the roots, leading to low dry weight 
accumulation. Cotton seedlings responded to low P stress by increasing the 
number of lateral roots, specific root length, branch density, root length 
density, and length of root hairs. Additionally, the life span of root hairs was 
prolonged. Low P stress also reduced the average diameter of roots, promoted 
root extension, expanded the root coverage area, and increased the range of P 
acquisition. Principal component analysis revealed that the net root growth 
rate, root length density, root dry weight, P absorption efficiency, average 
root hair length, and taproot daily growth significantly influenced the cotton 
root architecture. Collectively, these results show that low P stress reduces 
the net growth rate of cotton seedling roots and restricts plant growth. Plants 
respond to P deficiency by extending the life span of root hairs and increasing 
specific root length and lateral root branch density. This change in root system 
architecture improves the adaptability of plants to low P conditions. The 
findings of this study may guide the selection of cotton varieties with 
efficient P utilization.

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised complex moral dilemmas that have been the 
subject of extensive public debate. Here, we study how people judge a set of 
controversial actions related to the crisis: relaxing data privacy standards to 
allow public control of the pandemic, forbidding public gatherings, denouncing a 
friend who violated COVID-19 protocols, prioritizing younger over older patients 
when medical resources are scarce, and reducing animal rights to accelerate 
vaccine development. We collected acceptability judgements in an initial 
large-scale study with participants from 10 Latin American countries (N = 15 
420). A formal analysis of the intrinsic correlations between responses to 
different dilemmas revealed that judgements were organized in two dimensions: 
one that reflects a focus on human life expectancy and one that cares about the 
health of all sentient lives in an equitable manner. These stereotyped patterns 
of responses were stronger in people who endorsed utilitarian decisions in a 
standardized scale. A second pre-registered study performed in the USA (N = 
1300) confirmed the replicability of these findings. Finally, we show how the 
prioritization of public health correlated with several contextual, personality 
and demographic factors. Overall, this research sheds light on the relationship 
between utilitarian decision-making and moral responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome that results from any structural or 
functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood, and results 
in low life quality and expectancy, creating a significant burden on the 
healthcare system. The pharmacological HF management has remained unchanged for 
a decade, however, several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the 
potential clinical benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, an 
antidiabetic agent, by reducing the rate of hospitalizations for HF, 
cardiovascular death, and all-cause death. The cardioprotective effects are 
characterized by reduction of inflammatory, metabolic and ionic dyshomeostasis 
despite the diabetic status. Since the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval in May 2020, SGLT2 inhibitors have been used 
mostly in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In this review 
article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the potential benefits, 
effectiveness, and safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors used in HF patients with 
no history of diabetes mellitus.

Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) develops in association with unrepaired, 
non-restrictive cardiac shunt lesions at the atrial, ventricular or arterial 
level over time. In developed countries, cardiac defects are being operated on 
in a timely manner, before pulmonary vascular disease develops. However, with 
rising immigration from underserved countries, we increasingly see patients with 
shunt lesions, that are not amenable for repair as pulmonary vascular disease 
has already established. ES describes a symptom complex and patients present 
with heterogeneous problems involving many organ systems (multisystem disorder). 
Care in tertiary specialist cardiac centers with access to multidisciplinary 
subspecialities is required. Central cyanosis with secondary erythrocytosis is 
one of the key features of patients with ES. Clinical consequences of 
longstanding hypoxia can lead to other organ complications, that involve other 
organs than the heart alone. Although ES patients have a better prognosis 
compared to other patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, ES grossly 
affects quality of life and morbidity is frequent. Follow-up and care at 
specialist congenital heart disease centers is highly recommended to prevent, to 
early diagnose and to timely manage complications of ES. This is necessary to 
maintain functional capacity, decrease morbidity and increase life expectancy 
for these vulnerable patients. The leading reasons for mortality are sudden 
cardiac death, progressive heart failure, and infectious diseases. Various 
factors have been shown to be associated with mortality like decreased arterial 
oxygen saturation, functional class, impaired exercise tolerance, syncopal 
events, iron deficiency, presence of pre-tricuspid shunts, arrhythmias, 
increased (NT-pro) brain natriuretic peptide, echocardiographic variables of 
right ventricular dysfunction and hospitalization for heart failure. Although to 
date there is no causal therapy to reverse pulmonary vascular disease, a greater 
armamentarium of targeted therapies is available, which have been shown to be 
beneficial in patients with ES.

Income is a strong predictor of adult mortality. Measuring income is not as 
simple as it may sound. It can be conceptualized at the individual or the 
household level, with the former better reflecting an individual's earning 
ability, and the latter better capturing living standards. Furthermore, 
respondents are often grouped into income categories based on their positions in 
the income distribution, and this operationalization can be done on the basis of 
age-specific or total population income distributions. In this study, we look at 
how four combinations of different conceptualizations (individual vs. household) 
and operationalizations (age-specific vs. total population) of income can affect 
mortality inequality estimates. Using Finnish registry data, we constructed 
period life tables for ages 25+ from 1996 to 2017 by gender and for four income 
definitions. The results indicated that the slope index of inequality for life 
expectancy varied by 1.1-5.7 years between income definitions, with larger 
differences observed for women than for men. The overall age patterns of 
relative index of inequality for mortality rates yielded by the four definitions 
were similar, but the levels differed. The period trends across income 
definitions were consistent for men, but not for women. We conclude that 
researchers should pay particular attention to the choice of the income 
definitions when analyzing the association between income and mortality, and 
when comparing the magnitude of inequality across studies and over time.

BACKGROUND: Area differences in life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy 
(HLE) in large geographical units have been monitored around the world. Area 
characteristics may be based on culture, history, socioeconomic status and 
discrimination in smaller geographical units, so it is important to consider 
these when looking at health inequality. We aimed to evaluate LE, HLE, and 
non-healthy life expectancy (NHLE) in 1707 municipalities using Areal 
Deprivation Index (ADI) in Japan for the first time.
METHODS: We calculated the observed LE, HLE, and NHLE using death, population, 
and Long-term care insurance data for 2010-2014 and applied the variance 
weighted least squares model to estimate LE, HLE, and NHLE by 100 percentiles 
using the standardized ADI.
FINDINGS: The estimated LE, HLE, and NHLE became lower as the deprivation index 
worsened: the differences between the most and least deprived areas for HLE were 
2·49 years for LE and 2·32 years for HLE in males; 1·22 years for LE and 0·93 
years for HLE in females. The observed LE and HLE in the most deprived areas 
were much lower than other areas.
INTERPRETATION: Using ADI has enabled us to see the disparity within 
municipalities precisely. LE and HLE outlier for the 100th percentile might be 
linked to historical areal deprivation and marginalization. Precise monitoring 
of socioeconomic status-based health inequalities could help manage these 
inequalities by identifying the groups most in need of intervention.

Sweden is known for high life expectancy and economic egalitarianism, yet in 
recent decades it has lost ground in both respects. This study tracked income 
inequality in old-age life expectancy and life span variation in Sweden between 
2006 and 2015, and examined whether patterns varied across levels of 
neighborhood deprivation. Income inequality in remaining life expectancy at ages 
65, 75, and 85 increased. The gap in life expectancy at age 65 grew by more than 
a year between the lowest and the highest income quartiles, for both men (from 
3.4 years in 2006 to 4.5 years in 2015) and women (from 2.3 to 3.4 years). This 
widening income gap in old-age life expectancy was driven by different rates of 
mortality improvement: individuals with higher incomes increased their life 
expectancy at a faster rate than did those with lower incomes. Women with the 
lowest incomes experienced no improvement in old-age life expectancy. 
Furthermore, life span variation increased in the lowest income quartile, while 
it decreased slightly among those in the highest quartile. Income was found to 
be a stronger determinant of old-age life expectancy than neighborhood 
deprivation.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary liver malignancy, 
represents a continuous challenge to clinicians as it is a leading cause of 
death due to cancer widely. Early detection is the only hope to cure patients 
from this deadly disease or possibly increase life expectancy. Mouse models are 
most acceptable studies as they have ability to manipulate their genome and 
transcriptome to evaluate mechanistic changes. In addition, system biology can 
improvise the understanding of molecular mechanism of HCC and also can reveal 
the protein hub involved in every stage of HCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, diethylnitrosamine and thioacetamide (TAA) were 
used to develop stage-specific HCC in Wistar rats. Histopathological changes, 
biochemical parameters, and the oxidative stress were measured in hepatocytes. 
We have reanalyzed the microarray dataset to identify the complex signaling 
pathways involved in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by TAA. GSE45050 dataset was 
downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the gene expression 
profile of nontumor, cirrhosis, and HCC was compared.
RESULTS: The study reveals stage-specific development of chronic HCC rat model 
and promising stage-specific targets (EHMT2, GMPS, and SPRY2) of HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: EHMT2, GMPS, and SPRY found as high centrality nodes in 
protein-protein interaction studies using high-throughput microarray data which 
tend to be present in signaling pathways and co-occur in a biological state of 
HCC. These genes can be targeted to understand the possible pathology, molecular 
changes, and target strategy under cirrhosis and HCC condition.

BACKGROUND: Although patient portals are widely used for health promotion, 
little is known about the use of palliative care and end-of-life (PCEOL) portal 
tools available for patients and caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and assess the user perspectives of PCEOL 
portal tools available to patients and caregivers described and evaluated in the 
literature.
METHODS: We performed a scoping review of the academic literature directed by 
the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) 
extension for Scoping Review and searched three databases. Sources were included 
if they reported the development or testing of a feature, resource, tool, or 
intervention; focused on at least one PCEOL domain defined by the National 
Coalition for Hospice and Palliative Care; targeted adults with serious illness 
or caregivers; and were offered via a patient portal tethered to an electronic 
medical record. We independently screened the titles and abstracts (n=796) for 
eligibility. Full-text (84/796, 10.6%) sources were reviewed. We abstracted 
descriptions of the portal tool name, content, targeted population, and reported 
user acceptability for each tool from included sources (n=19).
RESULTS: In total, 19 articles describing 12 tools were included, addressing the 
following PCEOL domains: ethical or legal (n=5), physical (n=5), and 
psychological or psychiatric (n=2). No tools for bereavement or hospice care 
were identified. Studies have reported high acceptability of tools among users; 
however, few sources commented on usability among older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: PCEOL patient portal tools are understudied. As medical care 
increasingly moves toward virtual platforms, future research should investigate 
the usability and acceptability of PCEOL patient portal resources and evaluate 
their impact on health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Watch and wait (WW) protocols have gained increasing popularity for 
patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and presumed complete 
clinical response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. While studies have 
demonstrated comparable survival and recurrence rates between WW and radical 
surgery, the decision to undergo surgery has significant effects on patient 
quality of life. We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing WW 
with abdominoperineal resection (APR) and low anterior resection (LAR) among 
patients with stage II/III rectal cancer.
METHODS: In this comparative-effectiveness study, we built Markov 
microsimulation models to simulate disease progression, death, costs, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for WW or APR/LAR. We assessed cost 
effectiveness using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs 
under $100,000/QALY considered cost effective. Probabilities of disease 
progression, death, and health utilities were extracted from published, 
peer-reviewed literature. We assessed costs from the payer perspective.
RESULTS: WW dominated both LAR and APR at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold 
of $100,000. Our model was most sensitive to rates of distant recurrence and 
regrowth after WW. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that WW was 
the dominant strategy over both APR and LAR over 100% of iterations across a 
range of WTP thresholds from $0-250,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests WW could reduce overall costs and increase 
effectiveness compared with either LAR or APR. Additional clinical research is 
needed to confirm the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of WW compared 
with surgery in rectal cancer.

Functional in vitro assessment of modified antibodies: Impact of label on 
protein properties.

Kingdom.

Labelling of therapeutic antibodies with radionuclides or fluorophores is 
routinely used to study their pharmacokinetic properties. A critical assumption 
in utilizing labelled therapeutic antibodies is that the label has no 
unfavourable effects on antibody charge, hydrophobicity, or receptor affinity. 
Ideally, the labelled protein should not have any significant deviations from 
the physiological properties of the original molecule. This article describes an 
established quality in vitro assessment workflow for labelled antibodies that 
ensures better prediction of changes in antibody pharmacokinetic (PK) properties 
after modifications. This analysis package considers degradation and aggregation 
analysis by size-exclusion chromatography, changes in neonatal-Fc-receptor 
(FcRn) affinity, and heparin interaction. FcRn binding is important for antibody 
recycling and half-life extension, whereas heparin affinity provides estimates 
on the rate of endocytosis through unspecific cell surface binding. 
Additionally, mass spectrometric analysis to determine the degree of labelling 
(DoL) completes the package and the combined analysis data allow to predict the 
label contribution to the PK properties of the modified antibody. This
