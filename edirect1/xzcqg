OBJECTIVES: Trials comparing the effects of transfusing RBC units of different 
storage durations have considered mortality or morbidity as outcomes. We perform 
the first economic evaluation alongside a full age of blood clinical trial with 
a large population assessing the impact of RBC storage duration on 
quality-of-life and costs in critically ill adults.
DESIGN: Quality-of-life was measured at 6 months post randomization using the 
EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level instrument. The economic evaluation considers 
quality-adjusted life year and cost implications from randomization to 6 months. 
A generalized linear model was used to estimate incremental costs (2016 U.S. 
dollars) and quality-adjusted life years, respectively while adjusting for 
baseline characteristics.
SETTING: Fifty-nine ICUs in five countries.
PATIENTS: Adults with an anticipated ICU stay of at least 24 hours when the 
decision had been made to transfuse at least one RBC unit.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either the freshest or oldest 
available compatible RBC units (standard practice) in the hospital transfusion 
service.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level utility scores were 
similar at 6 months-0.65 in the short-term and 0.63 in the long-term storage 
group (difference, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.00 to 0.04; p = 0.10). There were no 
significant differences in resource use between the two groups apart from 3.0 
fewer hospital readmission days (95% CI, -5.3 to -0.8; p = 0.01) during 
follow-up in the short-term storage group. There were no significant differences 
in adjusted total costs or quality-adjusted life years between the short- and 
long-term storage groups (incremental costs, -$2,358; 95% CI, -$5,586 to $711) 
and incremental quality-adjusted life years: 0.003 quality-adjusted life years 
(95% CI, -0.003 to 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Without considering the additional supply cost of implementing a 
freshest available RBC strategy for critical care patients, there is no evidence 
to suggest that the policy improves quality-of-life or reduces other costs 
compared with standard transfusion practice.

Quality Assurance Sampling Plans in US Stockpiles for Personal Protective 
Equipment.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles in the United States were 
established to facilitate rapid deployment of medical assets to sites affected 
by public health emergencies. Large quantities of PPE were introduced into US 
stockpiles because of the need to protect healthcare and other professionals 
during these events. Because most stockpiled PPE was acquired during, or 
immediately following, large-scale public health events, such as pandemic 
influenza planning (2005-20080), SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009-10), and Ebola 
(2014-15), aging PPE poses a significant problem. PPE such as N95 filtering face 
piece respirators were not designed to be stored for long periods, and much of 
the currently stored PPE has exceeded its manufacturer-assigned shelf life. 
Given the significant investment in the procurement and storage of PPE, along 
with projections of consumption during public health emergencies, discarding 
large quantities of potentially viable PPE is not an attractive option. Although 
shelf-life extension programs exist for other stockpiled medical assets, no such 
option is currently available for stockpiled PPE. This article posits stockpile 
quality assurance sampling plans as a mechanism through which shelf-life 
extension programs for stockpiled PPE may be achieved. We discuss some of the 
nuances that should be considered when developing a plan tailored to stockpiles 
and provide basic decision tools that may be used in the context of a quality 
assurance program tailored to stockpiled PPE. We also explore basic information 
by comparing and contrasting different sample size options.

BACKGROUND: The exposome is defined as the totality of environmental exposures 
from conception onwards. It calls for providing a holistic view of environmental 
exposures and their effects on human health by evaluating multiple environmental 
exposures simultaneously during critical periods of life.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of the urban exposome with birth weight.
METHODS: We estimated exposure to the urban exposome, including the built 
environment, air pollution, road traffic noise, meteorology, natural space, and 
road traffic (corresponding to 24 environmental indicators and 60 exposures) for 
nearly 32,000 pregnant women from six European birth cohorts. To evaluate 
associations with either continuous birth weight or term low birth weight (TLBW) 
risk, we primarily relied on the Deletion-Substitution-Addition (DSA) algorithm, 
which is an extension of the stepwise variable selection method. Second, we used 
an exposure-by-exposure exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS) method 
accounting for multiple hypotheses testing to report associations not adjusted 
for coexposures.
RESULTS: The most consistent statistically significant associations were 
observed between increasing green space exposure estimated as Normalized 
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and increased birth weight and decreased TLBW 
risk. Furthermore, we observed statistically significant associations among 
presence of public bus line, land use Shannon's Evenness Index, and traffic 
density and birth weight in our DSA analysis.
CONCLUSION: This investigation is the first large urban exposome study of birth 
weight that tests many environmental urban exposures. It confirmed previously 
reported associations for NDVI and generated new hypotheses for a number of 
built-environment exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3971.

PURPOSE: Accurate assessment of life expectancy is critical to treatment 
decision making in men with prostate cancer. We sought to externally validate 
the PCCI (Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index) to predict long-term mortality in 
men with prostate cancer and make it operational using claims data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational study of 181,009 men with 
prostate cancer in the Veterans Affairs Health System who were diagnosed from 
2000 to 2013. Overall mortality across the PCCI scores was analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Discrimination and 
calibration were measured using the C-index and the mean prediction error, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Among men with a PCCI score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9 and 10 or greater 
the 10-year overall mortality rate was 15%, 26%, 36%, 41%, 52% and 69%, 
respectively. Multivariable Cox analysis showed an increasing hazard of 
mortality with higher PCCI scores, including 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27), 1.69 (95% 
CI 1.61-1.76), 2.08 (95% CI 2.00-2.17), 2.88 (95% CI 2.76-3.00) and 4.50 (95% CI 
4.32-4.69) for a score of 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, 7 to 9 and 10 or greater, 
respectively. The C-index to predict overall mortality was 0.773. The mean 
absolute error to predict 10-year overall mortality was 0.032. Of the men with 
clinically localized disease, Gleason 6 or less with less than 10-year life 
expectancy and Gleason 7 or less with life expectancy less than 5 years as 
defined by the PCCI 3,999 of 12,185 (33%) and 1,038 of 3,930 (26%), 
respectively, underwent definitive local treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The PCCI is a claims based, externally validated tool to predict 
mortality in men with prostate cancer. Integrating the PCCI into clinical 
pathways may improve prostate cancer management through more accurate assessment 
of life expectancy.

This study aimed to figure out the economic burden of measles patients and 
explore the associated factors for total cost in measles cases that occurred in 
the year 2015 from Jiaxing, Jinhua, and Taizhou cities in Zhejiang Province, 
China. Direct interviews were conducted to collect information on patient 
expenses during treatment, including outpatient expenses, hospitalization 
expenses, self-treatment fees, productivity loss, and transportation fees. 
Descriptive epidemiological methods and chi-square tests were used to assess the 
direct and indirect cost of measles patients. Ordinal logistic regression was 
applied to explore the possible factors contributing to cost. A total of 136 
measles cases were investigated and the average direct cost, indirect cost, and 
total cost were #747.14, #520.12, and #1,267.26, respectively. Direct cost 
accounted for 58.96% of the total cost, which was significantly higher than the 
indirect cost (P < 0.001). In 2015, 1,386 confirmed cases were reported in the 
Zhejiang Province, and the overall direct, indirect, and total economic burden 
reached #1.04 million, #0.72 million, and #1.76 million, respectively. 
Quality-adjusted life years for measles patient were calculated to be 76.06 in 
Zhejiang, 2015. Hospitalization, occupation, complication, disease duration, 
age, and site had a significant influence on the total cost according to ordinal 
logistic regression, with the maximum contribution from hospitalization. Measles 
resulted in heavy economic burdens, and local public health departments or 
community health service centers should spare no effort to maintain a high rate 
of vaccination coverage and protect susceptible populations.

RNA is a regulator and catalyst of many cellular processes. Efforts to 
therapeutically harness RNA began with the discovery of myriad coding and 
non-coding RNAs and their versatile modes of action. However, due to its dynamic 
structure and the polar and repetitive nature of its surface, RNA presents a 
challenging target for drug design. For an RNA to be druggable, it must contain 
a motif that assumes a nearly fixed and unique conformation that a small 
molecule can recognize and bind consistently and with high affinity. Hence, 
reliable methods for determining the secondary and tertiary structures of RNA, 
and even the features and occupancy of potential drug binding sites are of 
utmost importance for the effective design of RNA-based therapeutics. Selective 
2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling 
(SHAPE-MaP) has emerged as such a method, by which RNA secondary structure can 
be probed at single-nucleotide resolution, under a variety of conditions, and in 
the presence of RNA-specific small-molecule ligands. In this review, we describe 
an in-depth protocol for using SHAPE-MaP to characterize RNA-small molecule 
interactions in cell culture (in cellulo). This method can be applied to 
transcripts of any size or abundance, and to determine the sites and affinities 
of small molecule binding, making it an essential and versatile tool for drug 
discovery.

Life expectancy inequalities are an established indicator of health 
inequalities. More recent attention has been given to lifespan variation, which 
measures the amount of heterogeneity in age at death across all individuals in a 
population. International studies have documented diverging socioeconomic trends 
in lifespan variation using individual level measures of income, education and 
occupation. Despite using different socioeconomic indicators and different 
indices of lifespan variation, studies reached the same conclusion: the most 
deprived experience the lowest life expectancy and highest lifespan variation, a 
double burden of mortality inequality. A finding of even greater concern is that 
relative differences in lifespan variation between socioeconomic group were 
growing at a faster rate than life expectancy differences. The magnitude of 
lifespan variation inequalities by area-level deprivation has received limited 
attention. Area-level measures of deprivation are actively used by governments 
for allocating resources to tackle health inequalities. Establishing if the same 
lifespan variation inequalities emerge for area-level deprivation will help to 
better inform governments about which dimension of mortality inequality should 
be targeted. We measure lifespan variation trends (1981-2011) stratified by an 
area-level measure of socioeconomic deprivation that is applicable to the entire 
population of Scotland, the country with the highest level of variation and one 
of the longest, sustained stagnating trends in Western Europe. We measure the 
gradient in variation using the slope and relative indices of inequality. The 
deprivation, age and cause specific components driving the increasing gradient 
are identified by decomposing the change in the slope index between 1981 and 
2011. Our results support the finding that the most advantaged are dying within 
an ever narrower age range while the most deprived are facing greater and 
increasing uncertainty. The least deprived group show an increasing advantage, 
over the national average, in terms of deaths from circulatory disease and 
external causes.

Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) from the bacterium Rhizobium radiobacter Rv3 are 
structurally related to antigenic mammalian oligomannoses on the HIV-1 envelope 
glycoprotein spike that are targets for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here, 
we prepared a hybrid structure of viral and bacterial epitopes as part of a 
vaccine design strategy to elicit oligomannose-specific HIV-neutralizing 
antibodies using glycoconjugates based on the Rv3 LOS structure. Starting from a 
Kdo2GlcNAc2 tetrasaccharide precursor, a central orthogonally protected mannose 
trichloroacetimidate donor was coupled to OH-5 of the innermost Kdo residue. To 
assemble larger glycans, the N-acetylamino groups of the glucosamine units were 
converted to imides to prevent formation of unwanted imidate byproducts. 
Blockwise coupling of the pentasaccharide acceptor with an α-(1→2)-linked 
mannotriosyl trichloroacetimidate donor introduced the D1-arm fragment. 
Glycosylation of O-6 of the central branching mannose with an 
α-(1→2)-α-(1→6)-linked mannotriosyl trichloroacetimidate donor unit then 
furnished the undecasaccharide harboring a D3-arm extension. Global deprotection 
yielded the 3-aminopropyl ligand, which was activated as an isothiocyanate or 
adipic acid succinimidoyl ester and conjugated to CRM197. However, 
representative oligomannose-specific HIV-neutralizing antibodies bound the 
undecasaccharide conjugates poorly. Possible reasons for this outcome are 
discussed herein along with paths for improvement.

With the advancement of medicine, the utility of protein therapeutics is 
increasing exponentially. However, a significant number of protein therapeutics 
suffer from grave limitations, which include their subpar pharmacokinetics. In 
this study, we have reviewed the emerging field of protein chimerization for 
improving the short circulatory half-life of protein therapeutics. We have 
discussed various aspects of protein therapeutics aiming at their mechanism of 
clearance and various approaches used to increase their short circulatory

The participation rate of older people in the labour market is forecast to 
increase due to demographic changes afoot. For example, low fertility rates, 
higher life expectancy, and increases in the retirement age will affect labour 
availability. The working-age population trends indicate that the age group 
55⁻64 years will expand. This trend is bolstered by policy debate about the 
sustainability of economic and social support systems for the wider population 
and necessary strategies to keep older workers in labour markets. Within the UK, 
as the statutory pension age is placed now at 67, changes affecting the national 
default retirement age (previously age 60 for women and 65 for men) already mean 
that many older workers will feature in workplaces past historical expectations. 
A lack of sensitivity about the adjustments older workers needed, due to 
age-related changes in health and functional capacities, attests the demoted 
valuing of ageing workers. Despite a rise in the importance of wisdom across 
cultures, the significance of experience that comes with ageing, however, has 
become less revered within the UK resulting in less than the institutional 
promotion of Positive Ageing might depict. This paper draws from a structured 
review of literature (SLR) which seeks to address the question of what is 
currently identified as 'Positive Ageing' to consider what contributions can be 
found in current literature that may represent these changes in the UK. The 
paper concludes that demographic change has stimulated significant re-thinking 
of workplace strategies for the maintenance of health and well-being of ageing 
workers at national or governmental policy levels. To ensure sustainability, 
workability, and productivity in work, however, the concept of Positive Ageing 
towards later life might be furthered despite that, at the organizational level, 
its enactment remains incomplete currently post retirement age.

Lysine (K) type cationic lipid with a propyl spacer and ditetradecyl hydrophobic 
moieties composing liposomes, K3C14, previously studied for gene delivery, were 
reported to activate the NLRP3 inflammasomes in human macrophages via the 
conventional phagolysosomal pathway. In this study, K3C16, a propyl spacer 
bearing lysine type lipids with dihexadecyl moieties (an extension of two 
hydrocarbon tail length) were compared with K3C14 as liposomes. Such a small 
change in tail length did not alter the physical properties such as size 
distribution, zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI). The NLRP3 
activation potency of K3C16 was shown to be 1.5-fold higher. Yet, the toxicity 
was minimal, whereas K3C14 has shown to cause significant cell death after 24 h 
incubation. Even in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors, cytochalasin D or 
dynasore, K3C16 continued to activate the NLRP3 inflammasomes and to induce 
IL-1β release. To our surprise, K3C16 liposomes were confirmed to fuse with the 
plasma membrane of human macrophages and CHO-K1 cells. It is demonstrated that 
the change in hydrophobic tail length by two hydrocarbons drastically changed a 
cellular entry route and potency in activating the NLRP3 inflammasomes.

BACKGROUND: Current treatment for severe hemophilia A is replacement of 
deficient factor. Although replacement therapy has improved life expectancy and 
quality, limitations include frequent infusions and high costs. Gene therapy is 
a potential alternative that utilizes an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector 
containing the human genetic code for factor 8 (FVIII) that transduces the 
liver, enabling endogenous production of FVIII. Individuals with preexisting 
immunity to AAV serotypes may be less likely to benefit from this treatment.
OBJECTIVES: This study measured seroprevalence of antibodies to AAV5 and 8 in an 
UK adult hemophilia A cohort.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients were recruited from seven hemophilia centres in the 
UK. Citrated plasma samples from 100 patients were tested for preexisting 
activities against AAV5 and 8 using AAV transduction inhibition and total 
antibodies assays.
RESULTS: Twent-one percent of patients had antibodies against AAV5 and 23% had 
antibodies against AAV8. Twenty-five percent and 38% of patients exhibited 
inhibitors of AAV5 or AAV8 cellular transduction respectively. Overall 
seroprevalence using either assay against AAV5 was 30% and against AAV8 was 40% 
in this cohort of hemophilia A patients. Seropositivity for both AAV5 and AAV8 
was seen in 24% of participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for preexisting immunity may be important in identifying 
patients most likely to benefit from gene therapy. Clinical studies may be 
needed to evaluate the impact of preexisting immunity on the safety and efficacy 
of AAV mediated gene therapy.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy of patients with multiple sclerosis 
(MS) requires a better knowledge of disease features in the older patients 
group.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and profile of cognitive impairment (CI) 
in older patients with MS and perform a comparison with younger patients.
METHODS: Patients were consecutively recruited for 6 months. Cognitive 
performance was assessed through the Brief Repeatable Battery and the Stroop 
Test. CI was defined as impairment in ≥ 2 cognitive domains.
RESULTS: We identified 111 patients older than 55 years (mean age 59.7 years). 
The prevalence of CI was 77.4%, which was significantly higher than in younger 
patients (42.8%; p < 0.01). Information processing speed was the most impaired 
domain (68.8%), followed by verbal learning (49.5%), executive function (47.7%), 
and visuospatial learning (26.6%). We found no significant differences in the 
prevalence of impairment in the distinct cognitive domains between older and 
younger patients with CI. Depression and fatigue were not associated with 
increased CI among patients in the older age group (p > 0.70).
CONCLUSION: There is a remarkably high frequency of CI in older patients with 
MS. The similar profile of CI between older and younger patients suggests that 
CI is mostly directly related to MS itself and not to comorbid age-related 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects approximately one-third of people 
diagnosed with diabetes, can be sight-threatening, and generates significant 
human and economic burden. Over the last 2 decades, newer therapies have 
emerged, offering significant clinical benefits, however at a cost. Given the 
scarcity of available budgets, the cost effectiveness of these newer treatments 
is of vital importance to policy makers.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, HEED 
and CRD databases to find and evaluate economic evaluations assessing the cost 
effectiveness of alterative DR treatments. Studies were assessed for their 
eligibility, findings and quality, and are presented in this systematic review.
RESULTS: Of the 5254 studies retrieved from the literature search, 17 were 
included in this review. For patients with proliferative DR, when early pars 
plana vitrectomy was compared with pan-retinal laser photocoagulation, similar 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was observed between the two. 
Treatment with either intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) or intravitreal bevacizumab 
(IVB) falls within acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds in the diabetic 
macular oedema (DMO) population; however, in the non-DMO population, the 
marginal benefit of IVR or IVB in relation to the marginal cost relative to 
laser does not justify their use. Among the anti-vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) therapies, IVB appears more attractive from an economic point of 
view due to its lower cost. For patients with DMO, studies indicate that a 
combination therapy of IVR or IVB with laser and, to a lesser degree, as 
monotherapy, are cost effective relative to laser monotherapy; IVR plus laser is 
cost effective relative to laser plus triamcinolone; and laser combined with 
triamcinolone injections is reportedly more cost effective over IVR for 
pseudophakic eyes only. Moreover, fluocinolone implants appear cost effective 
compared with sham implants, or when treating refractory DMO. IVR administered 
either pro re nata (PRN) or as 'treat and extend' dominated intravitreal 
aflibercept (IVA) in a few studies. On the other hand, IVR monotherapy or with 
laser (as well as IVA) does not compare favourably relative to IVB monotherapy 
or with laser.
CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation of cost-effectiveness data should be treated with 
caution in this case; details of the therapeutic regimen, such as dosage and 
frequency, and clinical efficacy of the treatments should be considered in 
relation to policy-making decisions. Given the scarcity of resources, the 
ever-increasing significance of health technology assessment, and the 
substantial differences in the methodologies of the studies presented in this 
review, there is a pressing need for more advanced and standardised approaches 
to assessing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the emerging anti-VEGF 
pharmacotherapies for the treatment of DMO.

The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the voice and quality-of-life 
outcomes of microscopic diode laser surgery (MDLS). The study was conducted on a 
series of 46 patients with Tis-T1a glottic carcinoma treated with microscopic 
endolaryngeal diode laser surgery. Patients were asked to complete the Voice 
Handicap Index and quality-of-life questionnaires of the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer. When comparing the pre- and postoperative 
scores, there were significant difference on the physical scores (P = .014) of 
the patients who underwent type III cordectomy and functional (P = .022), 
emotional (P = .002), and overall scores (P = .005) of the patients who 
underwent type IV cordectomy, in the direction of better quality of voice after 
MDLS. The postoperative functional, physical, emotional, and overall scores of 
groups were significantly increased with the extension of resection.

BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy decreases time to 
functional recovery compared with open distal pancreatectomy, but the 
cost-effectiveness and impact on disease-specific quality of life have yet to be 
established.
METHODS: The LEOPARD trial randomized patients to minimally invasive 
(robot-assisted or laparoscopic) or open distal pancreatectomy in 14 Dutch 
centres between April 2015 and March 2017. Use of hospital healthcare resources, 
complications and disease-specific quality of life were recorded up to 1 year 
after surgery. Unit costs of hospital healthcare resources were determined, and 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed. Primary outcomes 
were the costs per day earlier functional recovery and per quality-adjusted 
life-year.
RESULTS: All 104 patients who had a distal pancreatectomy (48 minimally invasive 
and 56 open) in the trial were included in this study. Patients who underwent a 
robot-assisted procedure were excluded from the cost analysis. Total medical 
costs were comparable after laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy (mean 
difference €-427 (95 per cent bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval 
€-4700 to 3613; P = 0·839). Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was shown to have 
a probability of at least 0·566 of being more cost-effective than the open 
approach at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €0 per day of earlier recovery, 
and a probability of 0·676 per additional quality-adjusted life-year at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €80 000. There were no significant differences 
in cosmetic satisfaction scores (median 9 (i.q.r. 5·75-10) versus 7 (4-8·75); 
P = 0·056) and disease-specific quality of life after minimally invasive 
(laparoscopic and robot-assisted procedures) versus open distal pancreatectomy.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was at least as cost-effective as 
open distal pancreatectomy in terms of time to functional recovery and 
quality-adjusted life-years. Cosmesis and quality of life were similar in the 
two groups 1 year after surgery.

The haemolytic biovar of Gallibacterium anatis (G. anatis) is responsible for 
urogenital, gastrointestinal, and respiratory diseases in chickens. There are 
numerous reports on the resistance of G. anatis to antibiotics and recurrence of 
the disease, which raise concerns about antimicrobial treatment efficiency. 
Vaccination has been considered as the most feasible procedure of prevention in 
high risk farms. Subunit vaccines containing immunogenic components can have 
practical protective value in preventive measures regarding the infection. The 
present study aimed to introduce a polytopic vaccine candidate based on epitope 
detection. All registered sequences of four immunogenic proteins, includig Flfa, 
GTxA, Gab_1309, and Gab_2348 were retrieved and directed for variational 
analysis. A vaccine isolate was selected for each protein and tested for B-cell 
epitope mapping using different tools. Furthermore, consensus selected 
immunogenic regions with special patterns fused together by flexible linkers 
were integrated into two constructs and checked for the best status of 
proteasomal cleavage sites, as well as hydropathy plot. Moreover, back 
translations, along with codon optimization were performed, and then some tags 
were added to the constructs. The selected consensus B-cell immunogenic epitopes 
were for 12656: AA114-181, 7990: AA114-181, Avicor: AA42-77, 134-197, and IPDH: 
61-155 for Flfa protein, AA185-235, AA372-457, and AA807-941 for GtxA-N, 
AA260-305, AA340-400, and AA110-146 for Gab-1309, and AA125-AA175 for Gab-2348. 
Two suitable patterns of attachment were selected from the different fusion 
patterns of epitopes in B-cell polytopic vaccinal constructs. Finally, the 
examination of these constructs showed their effect and efficacy for immune 
system stimulation. Based on bioinformatics results, these immunogens could be 
utilized as potential candidates to develop polytopic protective vaccines and 
design diagnostic kits.

Prostate cancer (PCa) testing involves a complex individually based decision 
making process. It should consider competing risks from other comorbidities when 
estimating a survival benefit from the early detection of clinically significant 
(cs)PCa. We aimed to develop a prediction tool that provides concrete advice for 
the general practitioner (GP) on whether to refer a man for further assessment. 
We hereto combined the probability of detecting csPCa and the potential overall 
survival benefit from early detection and treatment. The PCa detection 
probabilities were derived from 3616 men enrolled in the Dutch arm of the 
European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). Survival 
estimates were derived from 19,834 men from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER) registry, ERSPC, and Dutch life tables. Treatment benefit was 
estimated from the Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial (PIVOT, 
n = 731). The prediction of csPCa detection was based on prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA), age, %freePSA, and digital rectal examination (DRE). The life 
expectancy (LE) for patients with PCa receiving no treatment was adjusted for 
age and Charlson comorbidity index. A negative impact on LE and treatment 
benefit was found with higher age and more comorbidity. The proposed integrated 
approach may support triage at GP practices, as PCa is a heterogeneous disease 
in predominantly elderly men.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results after locking plate internal fixation of 
proximal humerus fractures by means of a motion capture system, and functional 
scales.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective study of a cohort of 47 elderly patients 
undergoing surgery from January 2010 to December 2014. After a minimum follow-up 
of two years, two functional scales (Constant-Murley and Quick DASH), and a 
quality of life scale (EQ-5D) were used for clinical evaluation. For objective 
evaluation of the range of motion a kinematic marker-free analysis with cameras 
was performed.
RESULTS: The average age was 74.85 years. Average functional scores were: 
Constant-Murley 70.06 points, Quick DASH 35.74 points and EQ-5D 6.79 points. The 
average range of motion was: flexion, 111.49°; extension: 24.13°; abduction: 
109.40°; adduction: 15.13°; external rotation: 38.96°, and internal rotation: 
49.28°. Correlation was found between the two functional scales, between them 
and the EQ-5D, and between range of motion and functional scales (except for 
external rotation) as well as between range of motion and EQ-5D (except for 
flexion and external rotation).
CONCLUSION: Locking plate osteosynthesis in proximal humerus fragility fractures 
achieved good functional and quality of life scores. Motion capture systems can 
be a useful tool for the functional assessment of shoulder pathology allowing an 
objective evaluation of range of motion.
