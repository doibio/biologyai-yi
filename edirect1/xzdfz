OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: People living with HIV (PLH) suffer disproportionately 
from the chronic diseases exacerbated by smoking tobacco. We performed a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the relative prevalence of 
smoking among PLH.
METHODS: We included observational studies reporting current smoking rates among 
PLH and comparators without HIV. We searched Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and SciELO 
from inception to 31 August 2019. We excluded studies that recruited 
participants with smoking related illness. We used a random effects model to 
estimate the odds ratio for current smoking in PLH and people without HIV. We 
used the Newcastle--Ottawa scale to assess methodological bias. We performed 
subgroup analysis based on sex and WHO region. We quantified heterogeneity with 
meta-regression and predictive distributions. PROSPERO 
registration:CRD42016052608.
RESULTS: We identified 6116 studies and included 37. Of 111 258 PLH compared 
with 10 961 217 HIV-negative participants pooled odds of smoking were 1.64 [(95% 
confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.45-1.85) (95% prediction interval: 0.66-4.10, 
I2 = 98.1%)]. Odds for men and women living with HIV were 1.68 [(95% CI: 
1.44-1.95) (95% prediction interval: 0.71-3.98, I2 = 91.1%)] and 2.16 [(95% CI: 
1.77-2.63) (95% prediction interval: 0.92-5.07, I2 = 81.7%)] respectively.
CONCLUSION: PLH are more likely to be smokers than people without HIV. This 
finding was true in subgroup analyses of men, women and in four of five WHO 
regions from which data were available. Meta-regression did not explain 
heterogeneity, which we attribute to the diversity of PLH populations worldwide. 
Smoking is a barrier to PLH achieving parity in life expectancy and an important 
covariate in studies of HIV-associated multimorbidity.

Background: The concept of cost-effectiveness is necessary for optimal 
utilization of limited health care resources. However, few studies have assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of palliative care using quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), considered common outcomes in health economics. Objective: We aimed to 
perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of palliative care for terminal cancer 
patients by using QALYs. Design: A retrospective cohort study was performed. 
Setting/Patients: We included 401 patients with stage IV cancer, who were 
hospitalized and died at a Japanese general hospital during the period April 
2014 to March 2019. Methods: Using the hospital database, we compared the total 
admission costs and QALYs based on pain levels of patients admitted to the 
palliative care (PC) department with those of patients admitted to other usual 
care (UC) departments. Patients in each group were matched through propensity 
scores to reduce bias. Bootstrapping estimated the 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CIs) and the probability that PC was more cost-effective than UC. Results: After 
matching, 128 patients in each group were selected. Converting 1 U.S. dollar 
(USD) to 100 Japanese yen, PC reduced mean total admission costs by 1732 USD 
(95% CI: 1584-1879) and improved mean health benefits by 0.0028 QALYs (95% CI: 
0.0025-0.0032) compared with UC. Based on the Japanese cost-effectiveness 
threshold, there was an 82% probability that PC was more cost-effective than UC. 
Conclusions: Our results indicated that admission of terminal cancer patients to 
the PC department was associated with improvement in cost-effectiveness. This 
finding could support the introduction of palliative care for terminal cancer 
patients. Our study was approved at St. Luke's International University (receipt 
number 18-R061 and at the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The 
Univesity of Tokyo (receipt number 31-29).

Biological age captures some of the variance in life expectancy for which 
chronological age is not accountable, and it quantifies the heterogeneity in the 
presentation of the aging phenotype in various individuals. Among the many 
quantitative measures of biological age, the mathematically uncomplicated 
frailty/deficit index is simply the proportion of the total health deficits in 
various health items surveyed in different individuals. We used 3 different 
statistical methods that are popular in machine learning to select 17-28 health 
items that together are highly predictive of survival/mortality, from 
independent study cohorts. From the selected sets, we calculated frailty indexes 
and Klemera-Doubal's biological age estimates, and then compared their mortality 
prediction performance using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Our 
results indicate that the frailty index outperforms age and Klemera-Doubal's 
biological age estimates, especially among the oldest old who are most prone to 
biological aging-caused mortality. We also showed that a DNA methylation index, 
which was generated by applying the frailty/deficit index calculation method to 
38 CpG sites that were selected using the same machine learning algorithms, can 
predict mortality even better than the best performing frailty index constructed 
from health, function, and blood chemistry.

The most appropriate type of diets to maintain or lose body weight over the 
medium to long term has been a matter of controversy and debates for more than 
half a century. Both voluntarily and coercive food restriction, resulting in 
negative energy and macronutrient balance and hence weight loss, have not been 
designed to be maintained for the long term. By contrast, when a classical and 
traditional type of alimentation is consumed in ad lib conditions (e.g., the 
Mediterranean "diet"), it generally provides an appropriate nutritional density 
of essential macronutrients and micronutrients; it is hence appropriate for 
long-term use, and it provides several benefits for health if the compliance of 
the individuals is maintained over time. In this short review, we focus on four 
specific aspects: first, the need to agree on a clear definition of what is 
"low" versus "high" in terms of total carbohydrate intake and total fat intakes, 
both generally inversely related, in a representative individual with a certain 
lifestyle and a certain body morphology; second, the importance of discussing 
the duration over which it could be prescribed, that is, acute versus chronic 
conditions, focusing on the comparison between the fashion and often ephemeral 
low-carbohydrate diet (acute) with the well-recognized traditional Mediterranean 
type of alimentation (chronic), which includes lifestyle changes; third, the 
particular metabolic characteristics induced by the low-carbohydrate (high fat) 
diet, namely, the scramble up of ketone bodies production. The recent debate on 
ketogenic diets concern whether or not, in iso-energetic conditions, 
low-carbohydrate diets would significantly enhance energy expenditure. This is 
an issue that is more "academic" than practical, on the ground that the putative 
difference of 100-150 kcal/day or so (in the recent studies) is not negligible 
but within the inherent error of the methodology used to track total energy 
expenditure in free living conditions by the doubly labeled water technique. 
Fourth, the potential medical risks and shortcomings of ingesting (over the long 
term) low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets could exacerbate underlying renal 
dysfunction, consecutive to the joint combination of high-fat, high-protein 
diets, particularly in individuals with obesity. This particular diet promotes 
metabolic acidosis and renal hyperfiltration, which ultimately may contribute to 
a significant reduction in life expectancy in middle-age people.

Multilayer bottles consisting of chitosan (CS), microcrystalline cellulose 
(MCC), whey protein isolate (WPI), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were 
tested as novel materials for packaging and extending shelf life of rosebud 
beverages. We studied the storage stability at 4 °C, 25 °C, 37 °C, and 55 °C by 
assessing the physical and biochemical parameters. The results show that 
multilayer PET bottles had better barrier performance and improved soluble 
solids content, pH, polyphenol content, color indices, and browning degree in 
rosebud beverages over the control at all studied temperatures. A shelf life 
model was established based on the Arrhenius equation, and the number of days 
when polyphenol contents dropped to <50% of the initial content was defined as 
the shelf life. Our results highlight the reliability of the prediction model, 
and we conclude that packaging rosebud beverages in multilayer PET bottles 
significantly extends the product shelf life, and this benefit was further 
extended at low temperatures.

OBJECTIVE: This article aims to describe 'The Mind-Body Well-being Initiative', 
a residential mental health treatment model based on the Lifestyle Medicine 
paradigm, which comprises a mind and body well-being programme. In people with 
severe mental illness (SMI), particularly for those experiencing psychotic 
illness, the physical health and mortality gap is significant with greater 
presence of chronic disease and a 15-20-year life expectancy gap.
CONCLUSIONS: Our AIM Self-Capacity model of care attempts to address the 
physical and mental health care needs for the promotion of our patients' 
recovery.

Introduction: Despite the increasing role of patients in the US healthcare 
system, patients have yet been engaged in the value assessment of their 
treatments, including disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis 
(MS). The objectives of this review were therefore to summarize existing studies 
on cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and patients' preferences of DMTs for MS, and to discuss how to incorporate 
patients' preferences into the value assessment of DMTs.Area covered: We 
reviewed previous systematic reviews and conducted further search until November 
2020 for studies on CEA with QALYs and patients' preferences of DMTs for MS. We 
identified the outcomes that were assessed or valued in the CEA studies and the 
DMT attributes that were important to patients with MS.Expert opinion: Our 
literature review showed that the studies using CEA with QALYs failed to capture 
some important DMT attributes, e.g., route and frequency of administration, 
identified in the studies on the patients' preferences. Various approaches were 
available for incorporating the patients' preferences in the value assessment of 
DMTs for MS. We supported this incorporation, which subsequently would increase 
patient access to preferred DMTs.

The progressively increasing frailty, morbidity and mortality of aging organisms 
coincides with, and may be causally related to, their waning ability to adapt to 
environmental perturbations. Transcriptional responses to challenges, such as 
oxidative stress or pathogens, diminish with age. This effect is manifest in the 
declining function of the stress responsive transcription factor Nrf2. 
Protective gene expression programs that are controlled by the Drosophila Nrf2 
homolog, CncC, support homeostasis and longevity. Age-associated chromatin 
changes make these genes inaccessible to CncC binding and render them inert to 
signal-dependent transcriptional activation in old animals. In a previous paper, 
we have reported that overexpression of the CncC dimerization partner Maf-S 
counteracts this degenerative effect and preserves organism fitness. Building on 
this work, we show here that Maf-S overexpression prevents loss of chromatin 
accessibility and maintains gene responsiveness. Moreover, the same outcome, 
along with an extension of lifespan, can be achieved by inducing CncC target 
gene expression pharmacologically throughout adult life. Thus, pharmacological 
or dietary interventions that can preserve stress responsive gene expression may 
be feasible anti-aging strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Uptake of early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) varies widely across 
sub-Saharan African settings. We evaluated the potential clinical impact and 
cost-effectiveness of universal maternal HIV screening at infant immunization 
visits, with referral to EID and maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
initiation.
METHODS: Using the CEPAC-Pediatric model, we compared two strategies for infants 
born in 2017 in Côte d'Ivoire (CI), South Africa (SA), and Zimbabwe: (1) 
existing EID programmes offering six-week nucleic acid testing (NAT) for infants 
with known HIV exposure (EID), and (2) EID plus universal maternal HIV screening 
at six-week infant immunization visits, leading to referral for infant NAT and 
maternal ART initiation (screen-and-test). Model inputs included published 
Ivoirian/South African/Zimbabwean data: maternal HIV prevalence 
(4.8/30.8/16.1%), current uptake of EID (40/95/65%) and six-week immunization 
attendance (99/74/94%). Referral rates for infant NAT and maternal ART 
initiation after screen-and-test were 80%. Costs included NAT ($24/infant), 
maternal screening ($10/mother-infant pair), ART ($5 to 31/month) and HIV care 
($15 to 190/month). Model outcomes included mother-to-child transmission of HIV 
(MTCT) among HIV-exposed infants, and life expectancy (LE) and mean lifetime 
per-person costs for children with HIV (CWH) and all children born in 2017. We 
calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using discounted 
(3%/year) lifetime costs and LE for all children. We considered two 
cost-effectiveness thresholds in each country: (1) the per-capita GDP 
($1720/6380/2150) per year-of-life saved (YLS), and (2) the CEPAC-generated ICER 
of offering 2 versus 1 lifetime ART regimens (e.g. offering second-line ART; 
$520/500/580/YLS).
RESULTS: With EID, projected six-week MTCT was 9.3% (CI), 4.2% (SA) and 5.2% 
(Zimbabwe). Screen-and-test decreased total MTCT by 0.2% to 0.5%, improved LE by 
2.0 to 3.5 years for CWH and 0.03 to 0.07 years for all children, and increased 
discounted costs by $17 to 22/child (all children). The ICER of screen-and-test 
compared to EID was $1340/YLS (CI), $650/YLS (SA) and $670/YLS (Zimbabwe), below 
the per-capita GDP but above the ICER of 2 versus 1 lifetime ART regimens in all 
countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal maternal HIV screening at immunization visits with 
referral to EID and maternal ART initiation may reduce MTCT, improve paediatric 
LE, and be of comparable value to current HIV-related interventions in high 
maternal HIV prevalence settings like SA and Zimbabwe.

BACKGROUND: TNF inhibitors are costly drugs supplied generally on health systems 
or private insurances. Performance analysis is essential to verify the results 
achieved by health technologies in these systems. The objective of the study was 
to compare the two most used biological drugs for the treatment of psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) in Brazil.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was built using a Markov model, with a 
five-year time horizon, a discount rate of 5%, and from the perspective of the 
Unified Health System. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Etanercept was the most cost-effective drug. Adalimumab became the most 
cost-effective drug in one of the four analysis scenarios with a willingness to 
pay from one gross domestic product per capita. The deterministic sensitivity 
analysis identified that the cost parameters had the greatest impact on the most 
effective drug. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that etanercept 
is the drug most likely to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The difference between the drugs in terms of utility was minimal and 
the costs were the main factor that impacted the cost-utility ratio, which 
points to the benefits of price renegotiation for the efficient allocation of 
resources in the health system.

Background: Three-dimensional anatomic models have been used for surgical 
planning and simulation in pediatric congenital heart surgery. This research is 
the first to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of 3D anatomic models 
with the intent to guide surgeons and decision makers on its use.Method: A 
decision tree and subsequent Markov model with a 15-year time horizon was 
constructed and analyzed for nine cardiovascular surgeries. Epidemiological, 
clinical, and economic data were derived from databases. Literature and experts 
were consulted to close data gaps. Scenario, one-way, threshold, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis captured methodological and parameter 
uncertainty.Results: Incremental costs of using anatomical models ranged from 
-366€ (95% credibility interval: -2595€; 1049€) in the Norwood operation to 
1485€ (95% CI: 1206€; 1792€) in atrial septal defect repair. Incremental 
health-benefits ranged from negligible in atrial septal defect repair to 0.54 
Quality Adjusted Life Years (95% CI: 0.06; 1.43) in truncus arteriosus repair. 
Variability in the results was mainly caused by a temporary postoperative 
quality-adjusted life years gain.Conclusion: For complex operations, the 
implementation of anatomic models is likely to be cost-effective on a 15 year 
time horizon. For the right indication, these models thus provide a clinical 
advantage at an acceptable cost.

The long-term effectiveness and safety of hyaluronic acid fillers in mid-face 
volume restoration in Asians remain unclear. The objective of this study was to 
compare the long-term effectiveness and safety of Neuramis Volume Lidocaine 
(SHAPE-NVL) and Juvederm Voluma with Lidocaine (VYC-20L) in mid-face volume 
restoration in Asians. Overall, 88 Korean subjects with moderate-to-severe 
age-related mid-face volume deficit on the Mid-Face Volume Deficit Scale (MFVDS) 
received SHAPE-NVL on one side and VYC-20L on the contralateral side of the 
face. Of the 81 subjects who completed the 48-week primary study, 69 subjects 
were enrolled in an extension study lasting 104  weeks. MFVDS score and global 
aesthetic improvement were assessed at each visit. Response was defined as a 
≥1-point reduction in MFVDS. At weeks 36 and 48, the responder rates for 
SHAPE-NVL were 81.93% and 80.72%, while those for VYC-20L were 85.54% and 
81.92%, respectively. At the 104-week visit, the responder rates were 73.91% and 
72.46% for SHAPE-NVL and VYC-20L, respectively. No subjects experienced any 
serious adverse events during the trial. SHAPE-NVL and VYC-20L showed comparable 
longevity and safety in mid-face volume restoration over 2  years in Asians. 
Both had durable effects for up to 2  years with minimal safety concerns.

BACKGROUND: The addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to 
cytoreductive surgery has been associated with encouraging survival results in 
some patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases who were eligible for 
complete macroscopic resection. We aimed to assess the specific benefit of 
adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery compared with receiving cytoreductive 
surgery alone.
METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial at 17 cancer centres in 
France. Eligible patients were aged 18-70 years and had histologically proven 
colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases, WHO performance status of 0 or 1, 
a Peritoneal Cancer Index of 25 or less, and were eligible to receive systemic 
chemotherapy for 6 months (ie, they had adequate organ function and life 
expectancy of at least 12 weeks). Patients in whom complete macroscopic 
resection or surgical resection with less than 1 mm residual tumour tissue was 
completed were randomly assigned (1:1) to cytoreductive surgery with or without 
oxaliplatin-based HIPEC. Randomisation was done centrally using minimisation, 
and stratified by centre, completeness of cytoreduction, number of previous 
systemic chemotherapy lines, and timing of protocol-mandated systemic 
chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin HIPEC was administered by the closed (360 mg/m2) or 
open (460 mg/m2) abdomen techniques, and systemic chemotherapy (400 mg/m2 
fluorouracil and 20 mg/m2 folinic acid) was delivered intravenously 20 min 
before HIPEC. All individuals received systemic chemotherapy (of investigators' 
choosing) with or without targeted therapy before or after surgery, or both. The 
primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed in the 
intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received 
surgery. This trial is registed with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00769405, and is now 
completed.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 11, 2008, and Jan 6, 2014, 265 patients were included and 
randomly assigned, 133 to the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group and 132 to 
the cytoreductive surgery alone group. After median follow-up of 63·8 months 
(IQR 53·0-77·1), median overall survival was 41·7 months (95% CI 36·2-53·8) in 
the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group and 41·2 months (35·1-49·7) in the 
cytoreductive surgery group (hazard ratio 1·00 [95·37% CI 0·63-1·58]; stratified 
log-rank p=0·99). At 30 days, two (2%) treatment-related deaths had occurred in 
each group.. Grade 3 or worse adverse events at 30 days were similar in 
frequency between groups (56 [42%] of 133 patients in the cytoreductive surgery 
plus HIPEC group vs 42 [32%] of 132 patients in the cytoreductive surgery group; 
p=0·083); however, at 60 days, grade 3 or worse adverse events were more common 
in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group (34 [26%] of 131 vs 20 [15%] of 
130; p=0·035).
INTERPRETATION: Considering the absence of an overall survival benefit after 
adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery and more frequent postoperative late 
complications with this combination, our data suggest that cytoreductive surgery 
alone should be the cornerstone of therapeutic strategies with curative intent 
for colorectal peritoneal metastases.

Hematopoietic stem cells provide continuous supply of all the immune cells, 
through proliferation and differentiation decisions. These decisions are 
controlled by local bone marrow environment as well as by long-range signals for 
example endocrine system. Sex dependent differential immunological responses 
have been described under homeostasis and disease conditions. Females show 
higher longevity than male counterpart that seems to depend on major female sex 
hormone, estrogen. There are four estrogens - Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), 
Estriol (E3) and Estetrol (E4) that spatially and temporarily present during 
different female reproductive phases. In this review, we discussed recent 
updates describing the effects of estrogen on HSC, immune cells and in bone 
biology. Estradiol (E2) being a major/abundant estrogen is extensively 
investigated, while effects of other estrogens E1, E3 and E4 are started to 
unravel recently. Furthermore, clinical effect of estrogen as hormone therapy is 
discussed in HSC and immune cells perspectives. The data presented in this 
review is compiled by searches of PubMed, database of American Cancer Society 
(ACS). We have included article from September 1994 to March 2020 as covering 
all article in chronological order is not fissile so we included relevant 
article with substantial information in this specific area of research by using 
the search term (alone or in combination) estrogen, hematopoietic stem cell, 
immune cells, gender difference, estrone, estriol, estetrol, therapeutic 
application, pregnancy, effect on bone.

Neurons are specialized cells, requiring a lot of energy for its proper 
functioning. Mitochondria are the key cellular organelles and produce most of 
the energy in the form of ATP, required for all the crucial functions of 
neurons. Hence, the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control 
is important for maintaining neuronal health. As a part of mitochondrial quality 
control, the aged and damaged mitochondria are removed through a selective mode 
of autophagy called mitophagy. However, in different pathological conditions, 
this process is impaired in neuronal cells and lead to a variety of 
neurodegenerative disease (NDD). Various studies indicate that specific protein 
aggregates, the characteristics of different NDDs, affect this process of 
mitophagy, adding to the severity and progression of diseases. Though, the 
detailed process of this association is yet to be explored. In light of the 
significant role of impaired mitophagy in NDDs, further studies have also 
investigated a large number of therapeutic strategies to target mitophagy in 
these diseases. Our current review summarizes the abnormalities in different 
mitophagy pathways and their association with different NDDs. We have also 
elaborated upon various novel therapeutic strategies and their limitations to 
enhance mitophagy in NDDs that may help in the management of symptoms and 
increasing the life expectancy of NDD patients. Thus, our study provides an 
overview of mitophagy in NDDs and emphasizes the need to elucidate the mechanism 
of impaired mitophagy prevalent across different NDDs in future research. This 
will help designing better treatment options with high efficacy and specificity.

PURPOSE: The value of parotidectomy in older patients is unclear. This study 
presents a decision model to help resolve this question.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation was used to 
compare outcomes in patients of different ages with pleomorphic adenoma of the 
parotid gland treated by surgery or surveillance.
RESULTS: In 30-year-old patients, surgery conferred a 3.5-year gain in life 
expectancy whereas in 75-year-olds, it was only 0.74 months. The expected rate 
of malignant transformation at age 30 years was 6.5% after surgery and 26.5% 
after surveillance; at age 65, corresponding rates were 0.8% and 10.7%. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that age was the only parameter that significantly 
contributed to life expectancy. The benefit of surgery was restricted in older 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Our Markov decision-analysis model suggests that patients older than 
65 years with pleomorphic adenoma have a limited survival advantage with surgery 
compared to surveillance.

The goal of prebiotic chemistry is the depiction of molecular evolution events 
preceding the emergence of life on Earth or elsewhere in the cosmos. Plausible 
experimental models require geochemical scenarios and robust chemistry. Today we 
know that the chemical and physical conditions for life to flourish on Earth 
were at work much earlier than thought, i.e., earlier than 4.4 billion years 
ago. In recent years, a geochemical model for the first five hundred million 
years of the history of our planet has been devised that would work as a cradle 
for life. Serpentinization processes in the Hadean eon affording self-assembled 
structures and vesicles provides the link between the catalytic properties of 
the inorganic environment and the impressive chemical potential of formamide to 
produce complete panels of organic molecules relevant in pre-genetic and 
pre-metabolic processes. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, we propose 
basic transformations connecting geochemistry to the chemistry of formamide, and 
we hint at the possible extension of this perspective to other worlds.

Resistance to anticancer treatments poses continuing challenges to oncology 
researchers and clinicians. The underlying mechanisms are complex and 
multifactorial. However, the immunologically "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) 
has recently emerged as one of the critical players in cancer progression and 
therapeutic resistance. Therefore, TME modulation through induction of an 
immunological switch towards inflammation ("warming up") is among the leading 
approaches in modern oncology. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are seen today not merely 
as tumor cell-killing (oncolytic) agents, but also as cancer therapeutics with 
multimodal antitumor action. Due to their intrinsic or engineered capacity for 
overcoming immune escape mechanisms, warming up the TME and promoting antitumor 
immune responses, OVs hold the potential for creating a proinflammatory 
background, which may in turn facilitate the action of other (immunomodulating) 
drugs. The latter provides the basis for the development of OV-based 
immunostimulatory anticancer combinations. This review deals with the smallest 
among all OVs, the H-1 parvovirus (H-1PV), and focuses on H-1PV-based 
combinatorial approaches, whose efficiency has been proven in preclinical and/or 
clinical settings. Special focus is given to cancer types with the most 
devastating impact on life expectancy that urgently call for novel therapies.

In Japan, population health with life expectancy (LE) and healthy life 
expectancy (HALE) as indicators varies across the 47 prefectures (administrative 
regions). This study investigates how health examination results, including 
attitude toward improving life habits, are associated with population health. 
The association between health checkup variables and summary population health 
outcomes (i.e., life expectancy and healthy life expectancy) was investigated 
using a cross-sectional ecological design with prefectures as the unit of 
analysis. The medical records, aggregated by prefecture, gender, and age in the 
National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of 
Japan (NDB) Open Data Japan, were used as health checkup variables. Body weight, 
blood pressure, liver enzymes, drinking habits, smoking habits, diabetes, serum 
lipids, and answers to questions regarding attitude toward improving health 
habits were significantly correlated to population health outcomes. Multiple 
regression analysis also revealed significant influence of these variables on 
population health. This study highlights that health examination results, 
including attitude toward improving health habits, are positively associated 
with population health. Consequently, implementing measures to improve health 
habits in response to the examination results could help the population maintain 
a healthy life.

Despite the recognized need to change the emphasis of health services by 
shifting the balance from treatment to prevention, limited progress has been 
made in many settings. This is true in oral health, where evidence for 
preventive interventions that work has not been systematically exploited in oral 
health services. While reorienting health services is complex and context 
specific, economics can bring a helpful perspective in understanding and 
predicting the impact of changes in resource allocation, provider remuneration 
systems, and patient payments. There is an increasing literature on the 
economics of different prevention approaches. However, much of this literature 
focuses on the costs and potential savings of alternative approaches and fails 
to take into account benefits. Even where benefits are taken into account, these 
tend to be narrowly focused on clinical outcomes using cost-effectiveness 
analysis, which may be of little relevance to the policy maker, patient, and the 
public. Some commonly used economic approaches (such as quality-adjusted life 
years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) may also not be appropriate to 
oral health. Using alternative techniques, including wider measures of benefit 
and employing priority setting and resource allocation tools, may provide more 
comprehensive information on economic impact to decision makers and 
stakeholders. In addition, it is important to consider the effects of provider 
remuneration in reorienting services. While there is some evidence about 
traditional models of remuneration (fee for service and capitation), less is 
known about pay for performance and blended systems. This article outlines areas 
in which economics can offer an insight into reorientation of health systems 
toward prevention, highlighting areas for further research and consideration.

BACKGROUND: Proton therapy is a promising advancement in radiation oncology 
especially in terms of reducing normal tissue toxicity, although it is currently 
expensive and of limited availability. Here we estimated the individual quality 
of life benefit and cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in patients with 
oropharyngeal cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT), as a 
decision-making tool for treatment individualization.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Normal tissue complication probability models were used 
to estimate the risk of dysphagia, esophagitis, hypothyroidism, xerostomia and 
oral mucositis for 33 patients, comparing delivered photon intensity-modulated 
RT (IMRT) plans to intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost were calculated for each complication 
while accounting for patient-specific conditional survival probability and 
assigning quality-adjustment factors based on complication severity. 
Cost-effectiveness was modeled based on upfront costs of IMPT and IMRT, and the 
cost of acute and/or long-term management of treatment complications. 
Uncertainties in all model parameters and sensitivity analyses were included 
through Monte Carlo sampling.
