PURPOSE: To examine the proportion of elderly prostate cancer patients receiving 
guideline-concordant treatment, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 29,001 men diagnosed in 2004-2007 with 
localized prostate cancer, aged 66 to 79 years, were included. We characterized 
the proportion of men who received treatment concordant with the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, stratified by risk group and age. 
Logistic regression was used to examine covariates associated with receipt of 
guideline-concordant management.
RESULTS: Guideline concordance was 79%-89% for patients with low- or 
intermediate-risk disease. Among high-risk patients, 66.6% of those aged 66-69 
years received guideline-concordant management, compared with 51.9% of those 
aged 75-79 years. Discordance was mainly due to conservative management-no 
treatment or hormone therapy alone. Among the subgroup of patients aged ≤76 
years with no measured comorbidity, findings were similar. On multivariable 
analysis, older age (75-79 vs 66-69 years, odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence 
interval 0.50-0.57) was associated with a lower likelihood of guideline 
concordance for high-risk prostate cancer, but comorbidity was not.
CONCLUSIONS: There is undertreatment of elderly but healthy patients with 
high-risk prostate cancer, the most aggressive form of this disease.

The use of dietary rosemary extract (DRE) at low doses is proposed as a 
nutritional strategy to improve meat preservation. Lamb diet was supplemented 
with 0, 200 or 400mg DRE (containing carnosic acid and carnosol at 1:1 w:w) per 
kg feed during the fattening stage. Meat quality was evaluated in lamb fillets 
packed under protective atmosphere and kept in retail conditions for up to 14 
days. The effects of diet and storage time were determined on different 
physical-chemical (L*a*b* color, pH, TBARS, protein oxidation and volatiles from 
lipid oxidation), microbial (total viable and psychrophilic bacteria, 
Enterobacteriaceae, molds and yeasts) and sensory (appearance and odor) 
characteristics of the meat. The antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of DRE on 
meat were demonstrated. DRE delayed lean and fat discoloration, lipid oxidation, 
odor deterioration and microbial spoilage, extending the shelf life time of 
fillets from around 9 to 13 days. Both DRE doses provided similar shelf life 
extension.

Pain is a significant and alarming symptom of cancer seriously affecting the 
activity and quality of life of patients. Recent research proved that inadequate 
analgesia shortens life expectancy. Therefore, pain relief is not only a 
possibility but a professional, ethical and moral commitment to relieve patients 
from suffering, as well as ensure their adequate quality of life and human 
dignity. Proper pain relief can be achieved with medical therapy in most of the 
cases and the pharmacological alternatives are available in Hungary. Yet medical 
activity regarding pain relief is far from the desired. This paper gives a short 
summary of the guidelines on medical pain management focusing particularly on 
the use of opioids.

Science, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan; and §Department 
of Pathology, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Colitis-associated cancer/dysplasia is an intestinal tract condition 
that can affect the life expectancy of patients with ulcerative colitis. It is 
often difficult to detect neoplastic lesions. This study evaluated whether any 
endoscopic features are effective for distinguishing colitis-associated 
cancer/dysplasia from nonneoplastic lesions in patients with ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: The study involved 52 patients with 61 lesions treated at Hiroshima 
University Hospital between September 1999 and May 2012: 10 patients with 11 
dysplastic lesions, 5 patients with 5 intramucosal carcinomas, 3 patients with 3 
submucosal carcinomas, and 34 patients with 42 nonneoplastic lesions. All 
patients had undergone targeted biopsy. Endoscopic findings were compared 
between patients with biopsy-determined neoplasia and those with 
biopsy-determined nonneoplasia. Multivariate regression analysis was performed 
to identify magnifying chromocolonoscopy features predictive of neoplasia.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in conventional endoscopy features 
between the neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions. Under magnifying 
chromocolonoscopy, the pit density of the neoplastic lesions was found to be 
significantly greater than that of the nonneoplastic lesions (89% [17/19] versus 
60% [25/42], respectively). Pit margins were more frequently irregular in the 
neoplastic lesions than in the nonneoplastic lesions (63% [12/19] versus 33% 
[14/42], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In differentiating between colitis-associated neoplastic and 
nonneoplastic lesions, focus should be on the high residual density of pits and 
irregular pit margins observed under magnifying chromocolonoscopy.

BACKGROUND: In China, recent rises in syphilis and HIV cases have increased the 
focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission of these infections. We assess 
the health and economic outcomes of different strategies of prenatal HIV and 
syphilis screening from the local health department's perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort decision analysis model was used to estimate the health 
and economic outcomes of pregnancy using disease prevalence and cost data from 
local sources and, if unavailable, from published literature. Adverse pregnancy 
outcomes included induced abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, neonatal 
death, congenital syphilis in live-born infants, and perinatal HIV infection. We 
examined 4 screening strategies: no screening, screening for HIV only, for 
syphilis only, and for both HIV and syphilis. We estimated disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) for each health outcome using life expectancies and 
infections for mothers and newborns.
RESULTS: For a simulated cohort of 10,000 pregnant women (0.07% prevalence for 
HIV and 0.25% for syphilis; 10% of HIV-positives were coinfected with syphilis), 
the estimated costs per DALY prevented were as follows: syphilis-only, $168; 
HIV-and-syphilis, $359; and HIV-only, $5636. The estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio if an existing HIV-only strategy added syphilis 
screening (i.e., move from the HIV-only strategy to the HIV-and-syphilis 
strategy) was $140 per additional DALY prevented.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing prevalence of syphilis and HIV among pregnant 
women in China, prenatal HIV screening programs that also include syphilis 
screening are likely to be substantially more cost-effective than HIV screening 
alone and prevent many more adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Education is associated with longer life and less disability. Living longer 
increases risks of cognitive impairment, often producing disability. We examined 
associations among education, disability, and life expectancy for people with 
cognitive impairment, following a 1992 cohort ages 55+ for 23 063 person-years 
(Panel Study of Income Dynamics, n = 2165). We estimated monthly probabilities 
of disability and death for 7 education levels, adjusting for age, gender, 
ethnicity, and cognitive status. We used the probabilities to simulate 
populations with age-specific cognitive impairment incidence and monthly 
disability status through death. For those with cognitive impairment, education 
was associated with longer life and less disability. Among them, 
college-educated white women lived 3.2 more years than those with <8 years 
education, disabled 24.4% of life from age 55 compared with 36.7% (P< .0001). 
Increasing education will lengthen lives. Living longer, more people will have 
cognitive impairment. Education may limit their risk of disability and its 
duration.

Neuroscience, Oslo University Hospital HF, Box 4950, 0424, Nydalen, Oslo, 
Norway, torfja@online.no.

BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment for displaced proximal humeral fractures is 
widely used. However, there are very few randomized controlled studies comparing 
surgical treatment to conservative treatment, and the evidence is debated. The 
aim of this study was to describe patients with displaced proximal humeral 
fractures in a 2-years extension of a randomized controlled trial, their 
functional outcome and quality of life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from a single-center randomized controlled study 
of fifty patients aged 60 or above with displaced proximal humeral fracture 
(AO/OTA group B2 or C2) were randomized to surgical or conservative treatment. 
Surgery was performed with an angular stable implant. The main outcome was 
Constant score at 2-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were an ASES 
self-assessment form, the 15D quality of life assessment and radiographs at 2 
years.
RESULTS: A marked improvement of shoulder function and health-related quality of 
life for both surgically and conservatively treated patients occurs between 6 
and 12 months. Almost no change was observed between 1 and 2 year. There were no 
significant differences between the two treatments at 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial, surgical treatment proved no 
better results than conservative treatment for patients with displaced proximal 
humeral fracture at 2-year follow-up.

The Male Face of Caregiving: A Scoping Review of Men Caring for a Person With 
Dementia.

The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the empirical evidence 
published since 2007 on men as family caregivers of persons with dementia. 
Searches were conducted on Academic Search Complete, Ageline, CINAHL, Embase, 
Medline, PsychINFO, Social Work Abstracts, and Web of Science using 
database-specific controlled (i.e., MeSH terms) vocabulary related to dementia, 
men, and caregiving. Studies published in English between 2007 and 2012 that 
provided evidence of the experiences of male family caregivers of persons with 
dementia were included in the review. A total of 30 articles were selected for 
inclusion. Studies were grouped into three major themes for review: men's 
experiences of caregiving, relational factors, and outcomes of caregiving. The 
reviewed studies build on and support previous findings related to stress, 
burden, accessing services, and the importance of relational factors to men's 
caregiving experiences. However, there is a need for a framework that explains 
these findings in relation to masculinities. Such a framework would provide the 
necessary unifying context for a more powerful explanatory account. Furthermore, 
there appears to be the potential for great benefit in fully linking men's 
caregiver research to men's health issues as a means to articulate strategies to 
sustain the health and well-being of men caregivers. This seems especially 
relevant in light of the closing gender gap in life expectancy, which will 
ultimately see many men providing direct care to their partners.

Inflammatory co-morbidities in HIV+ individuals: learning lessons from healthy 
ageing.

Increased life expectancy due to improved efficacy of cART has uncovered an 
increased risk of age-related morbidities in HIV+ individuals and catalyzed 
significant research into mechanisms driving these diseases. HIV infection 
increases the risk of non-communicable diseases common in the aged, including 
cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive decline, non-AIDS malignancies, 
osteoporosis, and frailty. These observations suggest that HIV accelerates 
immunological ageing, and there are many immunological similarities with the 
aged, including shortened telomeres, accumulation of senescent T cells and 
altered monocyte phenotype/function. However, the most critical similarity 
between HIV+ individuals and the elderly, which most likely underpins the 
heightened risk of non-communicable diseases, is chronic inflammation and 
associated immune activation. Here, we review the similarities between HIV+ 
individuals and the aged regarding the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, 
the current evidence for mechanisms driving these processes and discuss current 
and potential therapeutic strategies for addressing inflammatory co-morbidity in 
HIV+ infection.

(1)Clinical Research Centre, Health Sciences Research, Kingston General 
Hospital, 76 Stuart Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 2V7, Canada, hopmanw@kgh.kari.net.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic leg ulceration may have significantly 
impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) due to pain, impaired mobility, 
poor sleep, depression, restricted work capacity, and social isolation. The 
study purpose was to examine the associations among sociodemographic and 
clinical factors and HRQOL in a large sample of community-dwelling adults being 
treated for leg ulcers.
METHODS: Data are from the cross-sectional baseline assessment of the Canadian 
Bandaging Trial, a multi-center, randomized controlled trial conducted to assess 
time to healing with two forms of high-compression bandaging. All participants 
received a comprehensive, standardized clinical assessment, and completed the 
12-item Short Form (SF-12) and McGill Pain Questionnaire. SF-12 data were 
compared to age- and sex-adjusted norms, and multivariable logistic regression 
was used to identify factors associated with whether individuals were below, or 
at/above their normative values on the physical and mental component summary 
(PCS, MCS).
RESULTS: Of 424 individuals enrolled over a 50-month period, 407 (96 %) 
completed the SF-12. Mean age was 65 ± 17 years, and 55 % were women. Mean PCS 
was 39.1 ± 9.9 with 91 (22.4 %) scoring at/above the mean value for their age 
and sex; equivalent values for the MCS were 51.4 ± 9.9 and 209 (51.4 %). Higher 
levels of pain, younger age, larger size and longer duration of ulcer, and 
limited mobility were associated with poorer HRQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm the considerable burden of illness associated with 
leg ulcers. Given the chronic and recurring nature of the condition, strategies 
focused on improving HRQOL and healing are needed for this vulnerable 
population.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) decreases resistance to fatigue and life expectancy. 
The aim of this study was to correlate some indirect Doppler indices of PH with 
tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation criteria and to relate PH on different 
indices with the severity of clinical signs. Furthermore the pathogenetic 
mechanisms associated to PH development were discussed. Dogs with Doppler 
echocardiographic evidence of PH diagnosed by assessment of pulmonary and 
tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity were selected, their clinical records were 
reviewed and a clinical score was computed. Seventeen cases of PH were 
identified. The degree of PH was assessed based on systolic or diastolic 
pulmonary pressure and the indirect Doppler indices (AT/ET and Tei Index) were 
calculated; data were statistically evaluated. Indirect Doppler indices were 
calculated also in a control group of seven healthy dogs. The most common 
clinical signs were coughing, dyspnea and syncope; the most common condition 
associated to PH development was the left-sided valvular heart disease. A 
significant positive correlation was found between Tei Index and both the 
systolic pressure and the severity of PH while no correlations were found 
between PH on different indices and clinical score and/or severity of clinical 
signs. Results of this study suggest that Tei-index could be an useful support 
not only to reveal PH but also to give information on the severity of PH. The 
clinical picture in dogs with PH is apparently unpredictable and not strictly 
correlated with the severity of PH.

Metastatic pleuritis can be a severely disabling condition. Recurrent pleural 
effusion often leads to severe shortness of breath. Treatment should consist of 
removal of the fluid as well as prevention of the re-accumulation of the pleural 
effusion. We describe the technique of subtotal pleurectomy by video-assisted 
thoracic surgery. We show several methods of stripping of the pleura as well as 
the application of talc. Subtotal parietal pleurectomy provides an effective 
treatment and control of recurrent effusion, but due to its invasive nature, it 
should be offered only to patients with a reasonable life expectancy.

Practising arts has been linked to lowering stress, anxiety and blood pressure. 
These mechanisms are all known to affect the ageing process. Therefore, we 
examine the relation between long-term involvement in arts and life expectancy 
at age 50 (LE50), in a cohort of 12,159 male acoustic, literary and visual 
artists, who were born between 1700 and 1899 in the Low Countries. We compared 
the life expectancy at age 50 of the various artists with the elite and middle 
class of that time. In the birth cohorts before 1850, acoustic (LE50:14.5-19.5) 
and literary artists (LE50:17.8-20.8) had a similar life expectancy at age 50 
compared to the elite (LE50:18.0-19.0). Only visual artists (LE50:15.5-17.1) had 
a lower life expectancy at age 50 compared to the elite at that time. For the 
most recent birth cohorts from 1850 through 1899, the comparison between artists 
and the elite reversed and acoustic and literary artist had a lower life 
expectancy at age 50, while visual artists enjoyed a similar life expectancy at 
age 50. Although artists belonged to the middle socioeconomic class and lived 
predominantly in urban areas with poor living conditions, they had a life 
expectancy similar to the elite population. This is in line with observed 
favourable effects of practicing arts on health in the short-term. From our 
historical analysis, we hypothesize several mechanisms through which artistic 
creativity could influence the ageing process and life expectancy. These 
hypotheses, however, should be formally tested before any definite conclusions 
on effects of arts on ageing can be drawn.

Life expectancy for US women lags behind that for women in other countries. 
Factors contributing to inequitable health for women are complex and include 
policy, community, healthcare access, and the interaction between the patient 
and her healthcare provider working within the healthcare system. We propose a 
societal pyramid of health accounting for the effects of these different factors 
and their impact on prevention, screening, diagnosis, and management of disease 
using the examples of smoking and obesity, two of the most important yet 
modifiable risk factors for chronic disease and death among US women.

Living with xeroderma pigmentosum: comprehensive photoprotection for highly 
photosensitive patients.

Health, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disease of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair with ultraviolet (UV) radiation sensitivity 
and a 10 000-fold increased risk of skin cancer. Symptoms include: freckle-like 
pigmentation in sun-exposed skin before age 2 years, severe burns after minimal 
sun exposure (50% of patients) and damage to exposed surfaces of the eyes with 
loss of vision and ocular cancer. About 25% of patients develop a progressive 
neurodegeneration. The combination of an inherited inability to repair 
UV-induced DNA damage and environmental exposure to UV must occur for cutaneous 
and ocular symptoms to develop. There is no cure for XP, but many of its 
manifestations may be reduced or prevented through consistent UV protection; 
thus XP serves as a model for sun protection of patients with marked 
photosenstivity. Sun protective clothing including hats, sunglasses and face 
shields, sun screen lotions and avoidance of environmental sources of UV are 
cornerstones of prevention of skin and eye damage and cancer. Although XP is a 
serious disease with the potential for limitation of life expectancy, XP 
patients can live active lives while at the same time avoiding UV.

Understanding public resistance to messages about health disparities.

USA.

Advocates and policymakers strategically communicate about health disparities in 
an effort to raise public awareness, often by emphasizing the social and 
economic factors that influence these disparities. Previous research suggests 
that predisposing political orientation and values related to self-reliance and 
personal responsibility may produce resistance to such messages. In this study, 
the authors culled 4 messages about the causes of disparities in life expectancy 
from public discourse and randomly presented them to a nationally representative 
sample of 732 Americans. Three indicators of message resistance were measured: 
belief that messages are weak, elicitation of anger, and production of 
counterarguments. Expected political differences in message resistance were 
identified, with Republicans perceiving messages to be weaker, arousing less 
anger, and eliciting more counterarguing than for Democrats. Among 3 messages 
that described the social determinants of health disparities, a message that 
identified the role of personal choices (explicitly acknowledging personal 
responsibility) produced the least anger and counterarguing among Republicans. 
Political differences in anger arousal and counterarguing can be explained, in 
part, by predisposing values toward personal responsibility. These findings have 
relevance for policy advocates seeking to bridge public divides surrounding 
health disparities and for scholars advancing theories of reactance to 
policy-relevant health messaging.

Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable interstitial 
lung disease occurring mainly in West Highland White Terriers (WHWTs). The 
effects of IPF on survival and on exercise tolerance in WHWTs are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate survival, prognostic factors, and exercise tolerance in 
WHWTs with IPF.
ANIMALS: Privately owned WHWTs; 15 with IPF and 11 healthy controls.
METHODS: Prospective case-control study conducted in 2007-2012. For survival, 
descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves with Cox 
proportional hazard ratios were performed. For the prognostic factor study, KM 
curves, Cox regression analysis, and logistic regression models were used. The 
6-minute walk test (6MWT) was used for measurement of exercise tolerance.
RESULTS: The median IPF-specific survival of deceased WHWTs (7/15) with IPF was 
32 (range 2-51) months from onset of clinical signs. The risk of death from 
birth in WHWTs with IPF in age-adjusted Cox model was significantly higher 
(hazard ratio 4.6; 95% confidence interval 1.05-19.74, P = .04) than in control 
WHWTs. No significant prognostic factors were identified. In 6MWT, WHWTs with 
IPF walked a shorter distance, median 398 m (range 273-519 m), than healthy 
controls, median 492 m (420-568 m), P = .05, and the partial pressure of oxygen 
in arterial blood in diseased dogs had a moderate positive correlation with 
walking distance (Kendall's tau-b = 0.69, P = .06).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: IPF had a negative impact on life 
expectancy, but individual survival varied considerably. 6MWT proved to be a 
well-tolerated, noninvasive test to evaluate exercise tolerance.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear why cystic fibrosis (CF) survival has improved. We 
wished to quantify increases in CF median age of death in the context of general 
population survival improvement.
METHOD: Death registration data analysis (US, England & Wales (E&W)-1972-2009).
RESULTS: CF median age of death is higher in US than E&W and greater for males, 
opposite to that of death from all causes. CF median age of death has increased 
by 0.543 life years per year (E&W, US combined (95% confidence interval 0.506, 
0.582)). The difference in median age at death between those dying from all 
causes and CF decreased in both territories. CF median age of death for males is 
greater than for females in both territories. This gap has not narrowed.
CONCLUSION: The median age of death of people with CF is improving more rapidly 
than that of the general population in US and E&W.

BACKGROUND AIMS: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is rare in pregnant 
patients. Stem cell therapy has been proposed as a potential therapeutic 
strategy for ALS.
METHODS: We describe a young woman with sporadic ALS that started during the 
second trimester of pregnancy with a rapid progression after delivery and severe 
motor impairment. Several drugs and stem cell injection by lumbar puncture were 
performed without changes before the patient was referred to our institution.
RESULTS: After bilateral autologous stem cell transplantation into the frontal 
motor cortices, we observed stabilization in ALS functional rating scale, 
significant delay of ALS progression and an extension in her life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Stem cell transplantation may alter the clinical course of ALS and 
improve quality of life in pre-menopausal women.

The increase in life expectancy has resulted in a high occurrence of dementia 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research on AD has undergone a paradigm shift from 
viewing it as a disease of old age to taking a life course perspective. Several 
vascular, lifestyle, psychological and genetic risk factors influencing this 
latent period have been recognized and they may act both independently and by 
potentiating each other. These risk factors have consequently been used to 
derive risk scores for predicting the likelihood of dementia. Despite population 
differences, age, low education and vascular risk factors were identified as key 
factors in all scoring systems. Risk scores can help to identify high-risk 
individuals who might benefit from different interventions. The European 
Dementia Prevention Initiative (EDPI), an international collaboration, 
encourages data sharing between different randomized controlled trials. At the 
moment, it includes three large ongoing European trials: Finnish Geriatric 
Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), 
Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (preDIVA), and Multidomain 
Alzheimer Prevention study (MAPT). Recently EDPI has developed a "Healthy Aging 
through Internet Counseling in Elderly" (HATICE) program, which intends to 
manage modifiable risk factors in an aged population through an easily 
accessible Internet platform. Thus, the focus of dementia research has shifted 
from identification of potential risk factors to using this information for 
developing interventions to prevent or delay the onset of dementia as well as 
identifying special high-risk populations who could be targeted in intervention 
trials.

Haemophiliacs who have had to keep a physically inactive lifestyle due to 
bleeding during childhood are likely to have little motivation for exercise. The 
purpose of this study is to clarify the effectiveness of the self-monitoring of 
home exercise for haemophiliacs. A randomized controlled trial was conducted 
with intervention over 8 weeks at four hospitals in Japan. Subjects included 32 
male outpatients aged 26-64 years without an inhibitor who were randomly 
allocated to a self-monitoring group and a control group. Individual exercise 
guidance with physical activity for improvement of their knee functions was 
given to both groups. The self-monitoring materials included an activity monitor 
and a feedback system so that the self-monitoring group could send feedback via 
the Internet and cellular phone. The self-monitoring was performed by checking 
exercise adherence and physical activity levels, bleeding history and injection 
of a coagulation factor. Both groups showed significant improvements in exercise 
adherence (P < 0.001) and physical function such as the strength of knee 
extension (P < 0.001), range of knee extension (P < 0.001), range of ankle 
dorsiflexion (P < 0.01), a modified Functional Reach (P < 0.05) and 10 metre 
gait time (P < 0.01). In particular, improvements in exercise adherence (P < 
0.05), self-efficacy (P < 0.05), and strength of knee extension (P < 0.05) were 
significant in the self-monitoring group compared with those in the control 
group. No increase in bleeding frequency and pain scale was noted. The 
self-monitoring of home exercise for haemophilic patients is useful for the 
improvement of exercise adherence, self-efficacy and knee extension strength.

OBJECTIVE: This study weighed the cost and benefit of thoracic endovascular 
aortic repair (TEVAR) vs open repair (OR) in the treatment of an acute 
complicated type B aortic dissection by (TBAD) estimating the cost-effectiveness 
to determine an optimal treatment strategy based on the best currently available 
evidence.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the health system payer 
was performed using a decision analytic model. Within this model, the 1-year 
survival, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs for a hypothetical 
cohort of patients with an acute complicated TBAD managed with TEVAR or OR were 
evaluated. Clinical effectiveness data, cost data, and transitional 
probabilities of different health states were derived from previously published 
high-quality studies or meta-analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed on uncertain model parameters.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed, in terms of QALYs, that OR appeared to 
be more expensive (incremental cost of €17,252.60) and less effective (-0.19 
QALYs) compared with TEVAR; hence, in terms of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, OR was dominated by TEVAR. As a result, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ie, the cost per life-year saved) was not 
calculated. The average cost-effectiveness ratio of TEVAR and OR per QALY gained 
was €56,316.79 and €108,421.91, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses, TEVAR was economically dominant in 100% of cases. The probability that 
TEVAR was economically attractive at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€50,000/QALY gained was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that TEVAR yielded more QALYs and was 
associated with lower 1-year costs compared with OR in patients with an acute 
complicated TBAD. As a result, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, TEVAR 
is the dominant therapy over OR for this disease under the predefined 
conditions.

There is evidence that persistent psychiatric disorders lead to age-related 
disease and premature mortality. Telomere length has emerged as a promising 
biomarker in studies that test the hypothesis that internalizing psychiatric 
disorders are associated with accumulating cellular damage. We tested the 
association between the persistence of internalizing disorders (depression, 
generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder) and leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL) in the prospective longitudinal Dunedin Study (n=1037). 
Analyses showed that the persistence of internalizing disorders across repeated 
assessments from ages 11 to 38 years predicted shorter LTL at age 38 years in a 
dose-response manner, specifically in men (β=-0.137, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): -0.232, -0.042, P=0.005). This association was not accounted for by 
alternative explanatory factors, including childhood maltreatment, tobacco 
smoking, substance dependence, psychiatric medication use, poor physical health 
or low socioeconomic status. Additional analyses using DNA from blood collected 
at two time points (ages 26 and 38 years) showed that LTL erosion was 
accelerated among men who were diagnosed with internalizing disorder in the 
interim (β=-0.111, 95% CI: -0.184, -0.037, P=0.003). No significant associations 
were found among women in any analysis, highlighting potential sex differences 
in internalizing-related telomere biology. These findings point to a potential 
mechanism linking internalizing disorders to accelerated biological aging in the 
first half of the life course, particularly in men. Because internalizing 
disorders are treatable, the findings suggest the hypothesis that treating 
psychiatric disorders in the first half of the life course may reduce the 
population burden of age-related disease and extend health expectancy.
