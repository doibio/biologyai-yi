BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab (Tmab), pertuzumab (Pmab), and taxane has been a 
standard first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic human epidermal growth 
factor (HER2)-positive breast cancer (HER2+ mBC) but has some safety issues due 
to taxane-induced toxicities. This has led to ongoing efforts to seek less toxic 
alternatives to taxanes that are equally effective when used in combination with 
Tmab plus Pmab. This study aims to show the non-inferiority of eribulin, a 
non-taxane microtubule inhibitor, against taxane, as a partner for dual HER2 
blockade.
METHODS/DESIGN: This multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, phase 
III study will involve a total of 480 Japanese women with HER2+ mBC who meet the 
following requirements: (1) age 20-70 years; (2) no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(excluding trastuzumab-emtansine) for mBC; (3) ≥ 6 months after prior 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy; (4) presence of any 
radiologically evaluable lesion; (5) left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%; 
(6) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1; (7) 
adequate organ function; and (8) life expectancy of at least 6 months. They will 
be randomized 1:1 to receive eribulin (1.4 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) or taxane 
(docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1 or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15) in 
combination with Tmab (8 mg/kg then 6 mg/kg) plus Pmab (840 mg then 420 mg) on 
day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The treatment will be continued until disease 
progression or unmanageable toxicity. The primary endpoint is progression-free 
survival as per investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Key secondary 
endpoints include objective response rate, overall survival, quality of life and 
safety. Non-inferiority will be tested with two margins of 1.33 and 1.25 in a 
stepwise manner. If non-inferiority is shown with a margin of 1.25, superiority 
will then be tested.
DISCUSSION: If this study shows the non-inferiority, or even superiority, of 
Tmab, Pmab, and eribulin against the existing taxane-containing regimen, this 
new regimen may become a standard first- or second-line treatment option for 
HER2+ mBC in Japan.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The general rule that every active malignancy is an 
absolute contraindication for kidney transplantation is challenged by kidney 
failure patients diagnosed with active surveillance-eligible prostate cancer 
during pretransplantation workup. Interdisciplinary treatment teams therefore 
often face the challenge of balancing the benefits of early kidney 
transplantation and the risk of metastatic progression. Hence, we compared the 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of different management strategies in kidney 
failure patients diagnosed with active surveillance-eligible prostate cancer 
during pretransplantation workup.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A discrete event simulation model 
was developed on the basis of a systematic literature search, clinical 
guidelines, and expert opinion. After model validation and calibration, we 
simulated four management strategies in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 
patients: Definitive treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) and listing after 
a waiting period of 2 years, definitive treatment and immediate listing, active 
surveillance and listing after a waiting period of 2 years, and active 
surveillance and immediate listing. Individual patient results (quality-adjusted 
life years; QALYs) were aggregated into strategy-specific means (± SEs).
RESULTS: Active surveillance and immediate listing yielded the highest amount of 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (6.97 ± 0.01 QALYs) followed by definitive 
treatment and immediate listing (6.75 ± 0.01 QALYs). These two strategies 
involving immediate listing not only outperformed those incorporating a waiting 
period of 2 years (definitive treatment: 6.32 ± 0.01 QALYs; active surveillance: 
6.59 ± 0.01 QALYs) but also yielded a higher proportion of successfully 
performed transplantations (72% and 74% versus 56% and 59%), with less time on 
hemodialysis on average (4.02 and 3.81 years versus 4.80 and 4.65 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Among kidney failure patients diagnosed with active 
surveillance-eligible prostate cancer during pretransplantation workup, the 
active surveillance and immediate listing strategy outperformed the alternative 
management strategies from a quality of life expectancy perspective, followed by 
definitive treatment and immediate listing.

The structure and mechanics of many connective tissues are dictated by a 
collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM), where collagen fibers provide 
topological cues that direct cell migration. However, comparatively little is 
known about how cells navigate the hyaluronic acid (HA)-rich, nanoporous ECM of 
the brain, a problem with fundamental implications for development, 
inflammation, and tumor invasion. Here, we demonstrate that glioblastoma cells 
adhere to and invade HA-rich matrix using microtentacles (McTNs), which extend 
tens of micrometers from the cell body and are distinct from filopodia. We 
observe these structures in continuous culture models and primary 
patient-derived tumor cells, as well as in synthetic HA matrix and organotypic 
brain slices. High-magnification and superresolution imaging reveals McTNs are 
dynamic, CD44-coated tubular protrusions containing microtubules and actin 
filaments, which respectively drive McTN extension and retraction. Molecular 
mechanistic studies reveal that McTNs are stabilized by an interplay between 
microtubule-driven protrusion, actomyosin-driven retraction, and CD44-mediated 
adhesion, where adhesive and cytoskeletal components are mechanistically coupled 
by an IQGAP1-CLIP170 complex. McTNs represent a previously unappreciated 
mechanism through which cells engage nanoporous HA matrix and may represent an 
important molecular target in physiology and disease.

An 85-year-old man was diagnosed with esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, 
E=G, Type 2, por, 6 cm in size, cT4aN1M0, cStage ⅢA. He had a history of 
atherosclerosis obliterans and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Considering the 
comorbidities and life expectancy, we decided to perform chemotherapy without 
tumor resection. Although the renal function was poor, we chose SP therapy(S-1 
80mg/kg/day for 14 days, followed by 7-day rest, CDDP 30mg/kg/day on day 
1)because the current status of the patient was satisfactory. The primary tumor 
remarkably shrank after 2 courses of SP therapy and completely disappeared after 
5 courses of SP therapy. There were no adverse events during the entire course 
of treatment. We detected clinical CR and provided the S-1 monotherapy for 
another 2 years. The patient has survived with no recurrences for 7 years since 
the initial chemotherapy. Although intensive chemotherapy regimens are avoided 
in elderly patients, the patient, in this case, showed a favorable prognosis 
from powerful chemotherapy.

Professional identities research in medical education has made significant 
contributions to the field. However, what comprises professional identities is 
rarely interrogated. This research tackles this relatively understudied 
component of professional identities research by understanding emergency 
medicine physicians' perspectives on the important elements that comprise their 
professional identities. Q-methodology was used to identify different clusters 
of viewpoints on professional identities; by extension, the core components that 
comprise emergency medicine physicians' professional identities are disclosed. 
Thirty-three emergency medicine physicians were recruited, through purposive 
sampling, from five hospitals across Taiwan. R software was used to analyse the 
Q-sorts, determine loadings on each viewpoint and formulate the viewpoint array. 
Analysis of interview data enhanced our understanding of these viewpoints. In 
total, twenty-five emergency medicine physicians loaded onto four distinct 
viewpoints, reflecting dominant perspectives of emergency medicine physicians' 
understanding of their professional identities. These distinct viewpoints 
demonstrated what emergency medicine physicians deemed significant in how they 
understood themselves. The viewpoints comprised: skills acquisition, 
capabilities and practical wisdom; coping ability and resilience; professional 
recognition and self-esteem; and wellbeing and quality of life. All viewpoints 
stressed the importance of trust between colleagues. These findings demonstrate 
the multitude of ways in which seemingly unified professional identities diverge 
across groups of individuals. An enhanced understanding of speciality work 
culture is gained. By understanding facets of professional identities, the 
development of future educational interventions and departmental initiatives, 
which might support key components of professional identities, can be explored.

PURPOSE: To explore in a sample of adult cancer patients: (1) the relative 
influence of initiation source, information format and consultation format on 
preferred approach to life expectancy disclosure using a discrete choice 
experiment (DCE); and (2) whether patient age, cancer type and perceived 
prognosis were associated with preferences within the three attributes.
METHODS: A DCE survey of adult solid tumour and haematological cancer patients. 
Participants chose between three hypothetical scenarios about life expectancy 
disclosure consisting of three attributes: initiation source (i.e. doctor versus 
patient-initiated discussion), information content (i.e. estimate presented as 
best-worst-typical length of life case scenario versus median survival time) and 
consultation format (i.e. two 20-min versus one 40-min consultation). 
Respondents selected their most preferred scenario within each question.
RESULTS: Three hundred and two patients completed the DCE (78% consent rate). 
Initiation source was the most influential predictor of patient choice. More 
preferred a doctor deliver life expectancy information as soon as it is 
available rather than waiting for the patient to ask (59% vs 41% z = - 7.396, 
p < 0.01). More patients preferred the two 20-min rather than the one 40-min 
consultation format (55% vs 45%, z = 4.284, p < 0.01). Information content did 
not influence choice. Age, cancer type, and patient-perceived prognosis were not 
associated with preferences.
CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals should assess cancer patients' preferences 
for engaging in life expectancy discussions as soon as they have this 
information, and ensure patients have adequate time to consider the information 
they receive, seek additional information and involve others if they wish.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) from an official recognition as a residual 
category in DSM-III has come a long way to be appreciated as a common underlying 
anxiety pathway in the literature. Despite still being defined as extreme 
anxiety and worry upon performance and about one's health, GAD seems to be a 
general umbrella of anxiety, covering even social anxiety and panic disorder 
(PD) and even when not treated and chronic, leading to major depressive disorder 
(MDD). Along the line of some other similar studies and contentions, in the 
present study we sought to validate the hypothesis of GAD encompassing social 
anxiety as well as performance anxiety and its extension to PD and MDD. We also 
examined the onset of each diagnostic category of GAD, PD and MDD and their 
developmental course in our clinical sample. 113 patients with Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD) out of 295 referrals to our mood and anxiety clinic 
during the three months of May-July 2019, were identified and included in this 
research. We expanded the definition of GAD as per our clinical observation to 
include any situations triggering the anxiety including any performance and 
social situations and did not exclude if the anxiety led to panic attacks. The 
results of our study showed that an encompassing GAD (including performance and 
social anxiety) has an early onset, recognized partially in childhood, but 
mostly during adolescence. An untreated GAD was complicated with panic disorder 
and episodes of major depression, each with an onset later in life. GAD in our 
study was also found to be familial and genetic, while its post-morbid 
depression seemed to be more a reaction to a long-standing untreated anxiety. 
The findings of our study if replicated has research implication of better 
understanding the developmental course of mood disorders and hold the promise of 
more targeted treatments of anxiety, panic and depression in clinical practice.

Morbid obesity afflicts one third of the population in the United States and 
decreases life expectancy by 5-20 years. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(LRYGB) has been an established operation for the treatment of morbid obesity 
for nearly three decades. There are several different techniques for performing 
a LRYGB. We describe our circular stapled gastrojejunostomy technique and our 
preoperative and postoperative management of patients.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of hemophiliacs is similar to that of the 
general population. As a result, the prevalence of age-related cardiovascular 
diseases has increased. We present our experience with hemophilia patients who 
underwent cardiac surgery in our Medical Center between 2004 and 2019.
METHODS: All hemophilia patients who underwent cardiac surgery were identified, 
and their peri-operative data evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: Ten patients were identified: six with hemophilia-A, one with 
hemophilia-B, and three with hemophilia-C (factor XI deficiency). Cardiac 
procedures included ten coronary artery bypass grafts and one aortic valve 
replacement. Hemophilia-A and B patients were treated with factor substitution, 
whereas patients with factor XI deficiency were treated with fresh frozen 
plasma. One patient died, and one patient suffered from non-active 
gastrointestinal bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: While major cardiac surgery can be performed safely on patients 
with hemophilia, a multidisciplinary team approach and strict postoperative

BACKGROUND: Within the UK, there has been debate on whether life expectancy is 
increasing or decreasing in particular single or 3-year periods, but there has 
been less thinking whether overall trends have changed. This paper considers the 
extent to which the trends in life expectancy for the UK and its nations have 
changed before and after 2011.
METHODS: We used the Office for National Statistics period life expectancy data 
for the UK and its nations. We used Lee's approach to project life expectancy 
based on repeated sampling of year-to-year change in the baseline periods 
(1990-2011 and 1980-2011) and applied that to 2012 onwards.
FINDINGS: Improvements in period life expectancy were substantially and 
consistently lower between 2012 and 2018 than predicted from the trends from 
1980 and, especially, from 1990. By 2018, life expectancy was lower than 
projected for females and males, respectively, by 1.22 and 1.52 years (England), 
1.44 and 0.95 years (Northern Ireland), 1.30 and 1.44 years (Scotland), 1.53 and 
1.63 years (Wales) and 1.24 and 1.49 years (UK overall), based on the 1990-2011 
baseline period. Using a longer baseline period, which includes the slower rates 
of improvement during the 1980s, slightly reduces the gap between the current 
life expectancies and the projected medians.
INTERPRETATION: Future academic and policy focus should be on the deviation of 
the life expectancy trends from the baseline projection rather than on 
year-to-year variation. Concerted policy focus to return life expectancy to the 
projected trends is now urgently required.

OBJECTIVE: Examine the health and economic impact of extending screening 
intervals in people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) 
without diabetes-related retinopathy (DR).
SETTING: Diabetic Eye Screening Wales (DESW).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study with cost-utility analysis (CUA) 
and Decremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (DCER) study.
INTERVENTION: Biennial screening versus usual care (annual screening).
INPUTS: Anonymised data from DESW were linked to primary care data for people 
with two prior screening events with no DR. Transition probabilities for 
progression to DR were estimated based on a subset of 26,812 and 1232 people 
with T2DM and T1DM, respectively. DCER above £20,000 per QALY was considered 
cost-effective.
RESULTS: The base case analysis DCER results of £71,243 and £23,446 per QALY for 
T2DM and T1DM respectively at a 3.5% discount rate and £56,822 and £14,221 
respectively when discounted at 1.5%. Diabetes management represented by the 
mean HbA1c was 7.5% for those with T2DM and 8.7% for T1DM.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Extending screening to biennial based on HbA1c, being the 
strongest predictor of progression of DR, at three levels of HbA1c 6.5%, 8.0% 
and 9.5% lost one QALY saving the NHS £106,075; £58,653 and £31,626 respectively 
for T2DM and £94,696, £37,646 and £11,089 respectively for T1DM. In addition, 
extending screening to biennial based on the duration of diabetes > 6 years for 
T2DM per QALY lost, saving the NHS £54,106 and for 6-12 and > 12 years for T1DM 
saving £83,856, £23,446 and £13,340 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Base case and sensitivity analyses indicate biennial screening to 
be cost-effective for T2DM irrespective of HbA1c and duration of diabetes. 
However, the uncertainty around the DCER indicates that annual screening should 
be maintained for those with T1DM especially when the HbA1c exceeds 80 mmol/mol 
(9.5%) and duration of diabetes is greater than 12 years.

PURPOSE: Metastases to the thyroid gland are uncommon and they represent 1-3% of 
all thyroid malignancy. The aim of this study is to analyze the diagnostic 
problems and the role of surgery in metastatic lesions to the thyroid.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who had undergone 
thyroidectomy at our Center. Out of more than 5000 thyroidectomies performed, 
only 9 cases had metastases to the thyroid gland.
RESULTS: The most common primary tumor arises from kidney and lung. Non-thyroid 
malignancies diagnosis was obtained with US, FNAC and PET-CT. Surgery was 
performed in all our series (except for one case) and the expectancy of life 
after surgery is related to the primary tumor and comorbidities of patients.
CONCLUSION: The thyroid gland can be a rare site of metastases for many tumors, 
especially in an abnormal thyroid gland. Surgery is associated with an improved 
survival and the extension of surgery depends on the extension of the neoplastic 
lesion.

OBJECTIVE: The aim: identifying the characteristics and trends of inequalities 
in the health of the population to substantiate the educational content of the 
curriculum for the training of Master in Public Health.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Bibliographic, sociological, 
medical-statistical and information-analytical methods were used in the study. 
Ukraine's healthcare institutions were the scientific base of the study. The 
data on the average life expectancy, morbidity, mortality, satisfaction of 
medical needs of different groups of the population for revealing the social 
gradient are analyzed. Documents on strategies to reduce health inequalities 
have been examined.
RESULTS: Results: Health inequalities between WHO countries have been 
identified, including a difference in the average life expectancy at birth of 
17.1 years in premature mortality due to differences in the levels of economic 
development of countries. The inequality in the prevalence of diseases and the 
difference in the satisfaction of specific medical needs among the first and 
tenth decile population of Ukraine were determined. The prevalence of diseases 
of the genitourinary system in the population older than 60 years with low rates 
by 27.3% was higher than the figure among financially insured persons. The 
incidence of ocular pathology among adults with different income levels varied 
1.8 times. The provisions of the WHO strategic documents on reducing health 
inequalities and its protection and on developing the public health system are 
analyzed. We justify the necessity of expanding the coverage of the problems of 
reducing disparities in health and health care in the course of training of the 
Master in Public Health. A modern curriculum "Social Medicine, Public Health" 
has been developed with the inclusion of inequalities in public health and 
appropriate educational and methodological support.
CONCLUSION: Conclusion: The strategic goal of reducing inequalities in public 
health and its care requires integrating these issues into a modern master's in 
public health program. The curriculum developed covers various aspects of health 
inequalities and health care, including the identification and assessment of 
disparities, the clarification of causes, the identification of 
counter-measures. Created educational and methodological support allows 
acquiring theoretical knowledge and practical skills that form the necessary 
competencies of professionals in the context of overcoming inequalities in 
health.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in 
the world. Traditional cancer therapies prolong the life expectancy of patients 
but often suffer from adverse reactions. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) has been 
recommended as a treatment option for lung cancer in several countries, due to 
its non-invasive procedures, high selectivity and weak side effects.
OBJECTIVE: We have designed and synthesized a biotin receptor-targeted silicon 
phthalocyanine (IV) (compound 1) which showed a good therapeutic effect on 
biotin receptor-positive tumors. Since the overexpression of Biotin Receptor 
(BR) is also present in human lung cancer cells (A549), we explored the 
therapeutic properties of compound 1 on A549 xenograft tumor models.
METHODS: The selectivity of compound 1 toward A549 cells was studied with a 
fluorescence microscope and IVIS Spectrum Imaging System. The cytotoxicity was 
measured using the MTT assay. In vivo anti-tumor activity was investigated on 
the nude mice bearing A549 xenografts.
RESULTS: In vitro assays proved that compound 1 could selectively accumulate in 
A549 cells via the BR-mediated internalization. In vivo imaging and distribution 
experiments showed that compound 1 could selectively accumulate in tumor tissues 
of tumor-bearing mice. After 16 days of the treatment, the volumes of tumor in 
the PDT group were obviously smaller than that in other groups.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that compound 1 is a promising 
photosensitizer and has broad application prospects in clinical PDT of lung 
cancers.

Advances in the treatment of Pompe disease have improved life expectancy and 
quality of life, but speech and oromotor function remain significantly affected. 
The purpose of this study was to expand on existing data and present new 
findings of speech acoustic and physiologic outcomes in Pompe disease. A 
retrospective analysis was carried out on results of speech, language and 
oromotor tests carried out in 14 children diagnosed with Pompe disease. The 
assessment battery included standardized tests of language, picture naming, 
maximum performance tests, and oromotor resistance tasks. Speech production was 
scored with respect to intelligibility, hypernasality, and articulatory 
accuracy. Language delays ranged from mild to severe in 1/3 of the children. 
Reduced speech intelligibility, disordered articulation, and hypernasality were 
present in at least 2/3 of the children. Maximum performance tests all fell at 
least 1 SD below normative means. Significant correlations were identified 
between maximum phonation time and articulation and between the S/Z ratio and 
intelligibility. Positive correlations were also found between tongue strength 
and articulation. Results confirm previous reports of speech and language 
function in Pompe disease. Clinical acoustic measures provide important insights 
into the speech deficits in this group of children and suggest possible 
treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of screening adult patients for pulmonary 
tuberculosis is not clear. As such, this study aims to identify the 
cost-effectiveness between the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and the sputum acid-fast 
bacilli (AFB) smear. Multi-outcomes were correct diagnosis, time to achieve 
correct diagnosis, and gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to reveal a possible clinical 
pathway of tuberculosis diagnosis. The researchers used a clinical study to 
establish the probability of all clinical pathways for input into this model. 
The sample size was calculated following the correct diagnosis. Participants 
were randomly divided into 2 groups. A structural questionnaire and the Thai 
version of quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) were used for interviewing.
RESULTS: The results showed that the time to achieve the correct diagnosis for 
the group using Xpert MTB/RIF was shorter than that for the group using the 
sputum AFB smear. Both the correct diagnosis and QALYs of the base case analysis 
presented the Xpert MTB/RIF method as dominant. A Monte Carlo model, which 
analyzed the Xpert MTB/RIF method, revealed that the average number of patients 
who were correctly diagnosed was 673, the QALYs were 945.85 years, and the total 
cost was $143 110.64. For the sputum AFB smear method, the average number who 
received a correct diagnosis was 592, the QALYs were 940.40 years, and the total 
cost was $196 666.84. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analysis confirmed 
that the Xpert MTB/RIF remained dominant.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide useful information for the National Strategic 
Plan to screen all adult patients for pulmonary tuberculosis.

Beyond skin deep: addressing comorbidities in psoriasis.

Kovitwanichkanont T(1), Chong AH(1)(2), Foley P(1)(2).

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is commonly encountered in 
primary care and is associated with significant morbidity that extends beyond 
the skin manifestations. Psoriasis is associated with an elevated risk of 
psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, obesity, insulin resistance, mental 
health disorders, certain types of malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease and 
other immune-related disorders, and hepatic and renal disease. Enhanced 
recognition of these comorbidities may lead to earlier diagnosis and potentially 
better overall health outcomes. Psoriatic nail involvement, severe skin disease 
and obesity are associated with a greater risk of psoriatic arthritis. 
Individuals with psoriasis should be routinely screened for psoriatic arthritis 
to allow for early intervention to improve long term prognosis. Life expectancy 
is reduced in people with psoriasis due to a variety of causes, with 
cardiovascular disease and malignancy being the most common aetiologies. 
Psoriasis affects several factors that contribute to worsened quality of life 
and increased risk of depression and anxiety. Effective therapies are now 
available that have been shown to concurrently improve skin disease, quality of 
life and psychiatric symptoms. As the concordance between psychosocial impact 
and objective disease severity does not always correlate, it is essential to 
tailor management strategies specifically to the needs of each individual. 
Cigarette smoking and excess alcohol consumption are among the most important 
modifiable risk factors that increase the likelihood of psoriasis development 
and severity of skin disease. This provides a compelling rationale for smoking 
cessation and limiting alcohol intake in people with psoriasis beyond their 
traditional harmful health consequences.

OBJECTIVES: To review assessments from the Institute for Clinical and Economic 
Review (ICER) and describe how cost-effectiveness, other benefits or 
disadvantages, and contextual considerations affect Council members' assessments 
of value.
METHODS: Assessments published by the ICER between December 2014 and April 2019 
were reviewed. Data on the assessment, intervention, results from 
cost-effectiveness analyses, and Council members' votes were extracted. Voting 
data were examined using bar charts and radar plots. Spearman's correlations 
between the number of votes for other benefits and contextual considerations 
were estimated. Two case studies (tisagenlecleucel and voretigene neparvovec) 
explored the relationship between different aspects of value and the vote.
RESULTS: Thirty-one ICER assessments were reviewed, which included 51 value 
votes and 17 votes on other benefits and contextual considerations. On average, 
interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios received a higher proportion 
of high and intermediate value votes; however, there was heterogeneity across 
assessments. Of other benefits or disadvantages, having a novel mechanism of 
action received the most votes (n = 138), and reducing health disparities 
received the fewest (n = 24). Of contextual considerations, treating a condition 
that has a severe impact on length and quality of life received the most votes 
(n = 164). There was a strong positive correlation between votes for reduced 
caregiver/family burden and improving return to work/productivity (ρ = 0.88, P < 
.05). Two case studies highlighted that factors beyond cost-effectiveness can 
lead to lower (tisagenlecleucel) or higher (voretigene neparvovec) assessments 
of value.
CONCLUSION: Council members' judgments about the value of interventions are 
influenced by other benefits or disadvantages and contextual considerations but 
anchored by cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation 
when added to a standardized exercise program for patients with chronic low back 
pain.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside 3 pragmatic multicenter, 
nonblinded randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in The Netherlands with a follow up 
of 52 weeks. Eligible participants were included between January 1, 2013, and 
October 24, 2014, and had chronic low back pain; a positive diagnostic block at 
the facet joints (n = 251), sacroiliac (SI) joints (n = 228), or a combination 
of facet joints, SI joints, and intervertebral discs (n = 202); and were 
unresponsive to initial conservative care. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and societal costs were measured using self-reported questionnaires. Missing 
data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapping was used to estimate 
statistical uncertainty.
RESULTS: After 52 weeks, no difference in costs between groups was found in the 
facet joint or combination RCT. The total costs were significantly higher for 
the intervention group in the SI joint RCT. The maximum probability of 
radiofrequency denervation being cost-effective when added to a standardized 
exercise program ranged from 0.10 in the facet joint RCT to 0.17 in the SI joint 
RCT irrespective of the ceiling ratio, and 0.65 at a ceiling ratio of €30 000 
per QALY in the combination RCT.
CONCLUSIONS: Although equivocal among patients with symptoms in a combination of 
the facet joints, SI joints, and intervertebral discs, evidence suggests that 
radiofrequency denervation combined with a standardized exercise program cannot 
be considered cost-effective from a societal perspective for patients with 
chronic low back pain originating from either facet or SI joints in a Dutch 
healthcare setting.
