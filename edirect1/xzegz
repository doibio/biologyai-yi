Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common diseases and the 8th leading 
cause of death worldwide. Individuals with T2D are at risk for several health 
complications that reduce their life expectancy and quality of life. Although 
several drugs for treating T2D are currently available, many of them have 
reported side effects ranging from mild to severe. In this work, we present the 
synthesis in a gram-scale as well as the in silico and in vitro activity of two 
semisynthetic glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) derivatives (namely FC-114 and FC-122) 
against Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and α-glucosidase enzymes. 
Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxicity assay on Human Foreskin fibroblast and 
the in vivo acute oral toxicity was also conducted. The anti-diabetic activity 
was determined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after oral administration 
with FC-114 or FC-122. Results showed that both GA derivatives have potent PTP1B 
inhibitory activity being FC-122, a dual PTP1B/α-glucosidase inhibitor that 
could increase insulin sensitivity and reduce intestinal glucose absorption. 
Molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and enzymatic kinetics studies revealed 
the inhibition mechanism of FC-122 against α-glucosidase. Both GA derivatives 
were safe and showed better anti-diabetic activity in vivo than the reference 
drug acarbose. Moreover, FC-114 improves insulin levels while decreasing LDL and 
total cholesterol levels without decreasing HDL cholesterol.

The Evolving Role of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in the Era of 
Transcatheter Valvular Procedures.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has long been the standard treatment 
for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). However, transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative; it was 
initially intended for high-risk patients and has now expanded its use to 
patients of all risk groups. While TAVR has demonstrated promising outcomes in 
diverse patient populations, uncertainties persist regarding its long-term 
durability and potential complications, raising the issue of the ideal lifetime 
management strategy for patients with AS. Therefore, SAVR continues to play an 
important role in clinical practice, particularly in younger patients with 
longer life expectancies, those with complex aortic anatomy who are unsuitable 
for TAVR, and those requiring concomitant surgical procedures. The choice 
between TAVR and SAVR warrants personalized decision-making, considering patient 
characteristics, comorbidities, anatomical considerations, and overall life 
expectancy. A multidisciplinary approach involving an experienced heart team is 
crucial in the preoperative evaluation process. In this review, we aimed to 
explore the current role of surgical management in addressing aortic valve 
stenosis amidst the expanding utilization of less invasive transcatheter 
procedures.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive 
therapeutic procedure with a consistent, linear increase in the number of 
implantations worldwide. Recently, TAVR has been rapidly expanding into 
lower-risk populations. Sporadic cases of late prosthesis-related Stanford type 
A dissection have been documented in self-expanding, as well as 
balloon-expandable TAVR valves, manifested primarily as acute aortic syndrome. 
We present the case of a 76-year-old male, who experienced refractory 
in-hospital cardiac arrest with non-shockable rhythm due to the obstruction of 
coronary flow caused by aortic dissection type A, with entry directly adjacent 
to the aortic prosthesis according to autopsy. The patient died despite the 
engagement of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Aortic dissection 
developed one year after a transfemoral TAVR procedure using an Edwards SAPIEN 3 
29 mm self-expanding valve. TAVR-associated late aortic dissection type A 
represents a rare, life-threatening condition with various clinical 
manifestations. The risk factors have not been well described and the 
differential diagnosis may be challenging. As the number of TAVR recipients and 
their life expectancy is increasing, we may face this complication more often in 
future.

ActiGraph® is a valid, frequently used, accelerometer to quantify moderate to 
vigorous physical activities (MVPA) in people with COPD. The impact of ActiGraph 
processing techniques on this population is unknown. This study aimed to explore 
the effect of data reduction techniques on MVPA in people with COPD. MVPA/day, 
through ActiGraph GT3X+, was estimated using: Troiano, Freedson 98 and 
FreedsonVM3 cutoffs, 15-s and 60-s epochs, and normal and low-frequency 
extension (LFE) filters. Cutoff, epoch, and filter effects were explored with 
Aligned Rank Transform-ANOVA. Lin's concordance correlation coefficients and 
Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate agreement and bias between different 
techniques. The analysis included 136 people with COPD (79% male; 68 ± 8 years; 
FEV1 51 ± 17% predicted). MVPA/day differed according to cutoff, filter, and 
epoch selection (p-value < 0.001). FreedsonVM3 cutoff, 15-s epochs, and LFE 
yielded the highest MVPA (45 min/day, 68% of physically active participants). 
Troiano cutoff, 60-s epochs, and normal filter yielded the lowest MVPA (8 
min/day, 20% of physically active participants). Only comparisons between 
Troiano and Freedson98 cutoffs presented an almost perfect agreement. ActiGraph 
data reduction techniques affected MVPA/day estimates and their interpretation 
at the individual and group level. Studies using different processing criteria 
should not be compared in people with COPD. Future studies with a gold standard 
are required to ascertain which processing technique produces the most accurate 
MVPA estimates in COPD. Meanwhile, future trials employing the ActiGraph GT3X+ 
may consider estimating MVPA based on Freedson VM3 cutofffs, 60-s epochs, and 
normal filter.

This paper presents a literature review and a case of an 83-year-old otherwise 
healthy female patient with a history of recent syncope, a sudden-onset 
right-sided temporal headache, diplopia, and vision loss. An exam revealed 
right-sided upper eyelid ptosis, myosis, vision loss, ophthalmoplegia, and a 
positive relative afferent pupillary defect on the right eye. CT showed sphenoid 
sinus opacification, eroded lateral sinus wall, Vidian canal, disease extension 
to the posterior ethmoid air cells, orbital apex, medial orbital wall, and 
pterygopalatine fossa. An orbital apex syndrome (Jacod's syndrome), Horner 
syndrome, and pterygopalatine fossa infection were diagnosed due to the acute 
invasive fungal sinusitis developed from a sphenoid sinus fungal ball. The 
patient was treated with antimicrobial therapy and transnasal endoscopic surgery 
twice to decompress the orbital apex, drain the abscess and obtain specimens for 
analysis. The right-sided ptosis, visual loss, ophthalmoplegia, and headache 
resolved entirely. No immune or comorbid diseases were identified, 
microbiological and histopathological analyses were negative, and MRI could not 
be performed on the presented patient. For that reason, the diagnostic procedure 
was non-standard. Nevertheless, the treatment outcome of this vision and 
life-threatening disease was satisfactory. Treating the fungal ball in an older 
or immunocompromised patient is essential to prevent invasive fungal 
rhinosinusitis and fatal complications.

Dairy cattle systems have targeted improvements in feed efficiency by selecting 
animals that can convert less feed into more products. Residual feed intake 
(RFI) has been the index of choice when selecting dairy cattle for feed 
efficiency. Nonetheless, RFI studies have focused on lactating cows, and the 
crucial importance of pre-weaning efficiency on farm profitability and cow 
productivity has been mostly neglected. This review discusses the current 
knowledge of how RFI divergence relates to nutrient metabolism in pre-weaning 
dairy calves, including the advantages and limitations of evaluating RFI in this 
phase. Existing literature indicates that nutrient utilization, energy 
metabolism, protein metabolism, vitamin metabolism, intestinal development, and 
hindgut bacterial populations may be implicated in RFI divergence between 
pre-weaning calves. Techniques developed to date to evaluate RFI in this phase 
are still evolving to better adapt to the unique characteristics of this phase, 
and more research is needed to fill in the gaps in our current understanding of 
early-life feed efficiency divergence in cattle. However, current results 
suggest great potential for selecting high-efficiency calves while in 
pre-weaning to accelerate the progress of genetic selection in dairy cattle.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a relatively new class 
of antidiabetic drugs that have shown favorable effects in heart failure (HF) 
patients, irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Recent 
studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on cardiac 
function and structure; however, less is known about dapagliflozin. The purpose 
of the current work was to investigate the association between the use of 
dapagliflozin and cardiac biomarkers as well as the cardiac structure in a 
cohort of patients with HF and diabetes mellitus (DM). The present work was an 
observational study that included 118 patients (dapagliflozin group n = 60; 
control group n = 58) with HF and DM. The inclusion criteria included: age > 18 
years, a history of DM and HF, regardless of LVEF, and hospitalization for HF 
exacerbation within the previous 6 months. The exclusion criteria were previous 
treatment with SGLT2i or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, a GFR< 30 
and life expectancy < 1 year. The evaluation of patients (at baseline, 6 and 12 
months) included a clinical assessment, laboratory blood tests and 
echocardiography. The Mann-Whitney test was used for the comparison of 
continuous variables between the two groups, while Friedman's analysis of 
variance for repeated measures was used for the comparison of continuous 
variables. Troponin (p < 0.001) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (p < 0.001) 
decreased significantly throughout the follow-up period in the dapagliflozin 
group, but not in the control group (p > 0.05 for both). The LV end-diastolic 
volume index (p < 0.001 for both groups) and LV end-systolic volume index (p < 
0.001 for both groups) decreased significantly in the dapagliflozin and the 
control group, respectively. The LVEF increased significantly (p < 0.001) only 
in the dapagliflozin group, whereas the global longitudinal strain (GLS) 
improved in the dapagliflozin group (p < 0.001) and was impaired in the control 
group (p = 0.021). The left atrial volume index decreased in the dapagliflozin 
group (p < 0.001) but remained unchanged in the control group (p = 0.114). 
Lastly, the left ventricular mass index increased significantly both in the 
dapagliflozin (p = 0.003) and control group (p = 0.001). Dapagliflozin, an 
SGLT2i, was associated with a reduction in cardiac biomarkers and with reverse 
cardiac remodeling in patients with HF and DM.

Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder with a 
deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity, which results in the intracellular 
accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids in 
various organs. Fabry nephropathy is one of the major complications of Fabry 
disease, and kidney damage is often related to cardiovascular disease and 
mortality. The treatment of Fabry nephropathy thus helps prolong life 
expectancy. Two treatment options for Fabry nephropathy and cardiopathy are now 
commercially available: enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase α agalsidase β, 
and a biosimilar of agalsidase β) and pharmacological chaperone therapy 
(migalastat). In this review, we summarize the efficacy of these treatment 
options for Fabry nephropathy with respect to renal function, proteinuria, and 
renal pathological findings. We also describe the importance of adjunctive 
therapy for Fabry nephropathy.

Background and Objectives: The demand for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation 
for extremely old patients is increasing. Prior to implanting PPMs, life 
expectancy evaluation is essential but difficult. We aimed to develop and 
validate a scoring system for all-cause mortality risk stratification prior to 
PPM implantation in patients aged ≥80. Materials and Methods: A total of 210 
patients aged ≥80 who received PPM implantation were included. Multivariable 
analysis was performed to assess the effects of different variables on all-cause 
mortality in a derivation cohort (n = 100). We developed the MELODY score for 
stratifying all-cause mortality prior to PPM implantation and tested the scoring 
system in a validation cohort (n = 102). Results: After 4.0 ± 2.7 years of 
follow-up, 54 patients (54%) had died. The 0.5-, 1- and 2-year all-cause 
mortality rates were 7%, 10% and 24%, respectively. The MELODY score based on 
body mass index <21 kg/m2 (HR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.06-4.61), estimated glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (3.35, 1.77-6.35), length of hospitalization 
before PPM implantation >7 days (1.87, 1.02-3.43) and dyspnea as the major 
presenting symptom (1.90, 1.03-3.50) successfully distinguished patients at high 
risk of mortality. Patients with MELODY scores ≥3 had a higher risk of mortality 
compared to those with MELODY scores <3 (8.49, 4.24-17.00). The areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves in predicting 0.5, 1 and 2 years 
mortality rates were 0.86, 0.81 and 0.74, respectively. The predictive value of 
the model was confirmed in a validation cohort. Conclusions: The novel scoring 
system is a simple and effective tool for all-cause mortality risk 
stratification prior to PPM implantation in patients aged ≥80.

The positive association between excessive dietary sodium intake, hypertension, 
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been widely investigated in observational 
studies and clinical trials. Reducing sodium intake is a proven strategy to 
prevent hypertension and the onset of CVD, a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality globally. Africa has the youngest population globally, which is key to 
the continent's sustainable development. However, in Africa, the epidemics of 
hypertension and CVD negatively impact life expectancy and economic growth. 
Ghana, like other African countries, is no exception. The factors contributing 
to the increasing burden of CVD and excessive sodium consumption are 
multi-faceted and multi-level, including individual lifestyle, neighborhood and 
built environments, and socio-economic and health policies. Thus, the 
implementation of evidence-based interventions such as the World Health 
Organization Best Buys that target the multi-level determinants of sodium 
consumption is urgently needed in Ghana and other African countries. The aim of 
this commentary is to highlight factors that contribute to excessive sodium 
consumption. Second, the commentary will showcase lessons of successful 
implementation of sodium reduction interventions in other countries. Such 
lessons may help avert CVD in young adults in Ghana and Africa.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, 
necessitating urgent and effective strategies to mitigate its consequences. 
Vaccination programs have been implemented worldwide to combat virus 
transmission and reduce the disease burden. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationship between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and all-cause excess 
mortality in 178 nations during the first two years of the pandemic. Multiple 
regression analysis, after adjusting for life expectancy at birth, confirmed a 
significant association between higher vaccination coverage and lower all-cause 
mortality rates (β = -106.8, 95% CI -175.4 to -38.2, p = 0.002). These findings 
underscore the importance of vaccination campaigns in reducing overall mortality 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based decision making and resource 
allocation can benefit from this information, facilitating the optimization of 
vaccination strategies for maximal impact on mortality reduction. Further 
research and continuous monitoring are crucial to understanding the long-term 
effects of vaccination coverage on population health in the ongoing pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Survival data after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) 
are scarce, and its impact on predicted life expectancy is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of TEER on 
postprocedural life expectancy among patients enrolled in the MitraSwiss 
registry through a relative survival (RS) analysis.
METHODS: Consecutive TEER patients 60 to 89 years of age enrolled between 2011 
and 2018 (N = 1140) were evaluated. RS was defined as the ratio between 
post-TEER survival and expected survival in an age-, sex- and calendar 
period-matched group derived from the Swiss national 2011 to 2019 mortality 
tables. The primary aim was to assess 5-year survival and RS after TEER. The 
secondary aim was to assess RS according to the etiology of mitral 
regurgitation, age class and sustained procedural success over time.
RESULTS: Overall, 5-year survival after TEER was 59.3% (95% CI: 54.9%-63.4%), 
whereas RS reached 80.5% (95% CI: 74.6%-86.0%). RS was 91.1% (95% CI: 
82.5%-98.6%) in primary mitral regurgitation (PMR) and 71.5% (95% CI: 
63.0%-79.3%) in secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR). Patients 80 to 89 years of 
age (n = 579) showed high 5-year RS (93.0%; 95% CI: 83.3%-101.9%). In this 
group, restoration of predicted life expectancy was achieved in PMR with a 
5-year RS of 100% (95% CI: 87.9%-110.7%), whereas sustained procedural success 
increased the RS rate to 90.6% (95% CI: 71.3%-107.3%) in SMR.
CONCLUSIONS: Mitral TEER in patients 80 to 89 years of age is able to restore 
predicted life expectancy in PMR, whereas in SMR with sustained procedural 
success, high RS estimates were observed. Our analysis suggests that successful, 
sustained mitral regurgitation reduction is key to survival improvement, 
particularly in patients 80 to 89 years of age.

Carrageenan-based active/intelligent packaging films containing anthocyanin and 
ZnO-doped CD (Zn-CD) from purple Kohlrabi peels were prepared for freshness 
monitoring and shelf-life extension of shrimp, and the influence of additives on 
the films' physical, functional, and structural properties was investigated. The 
films showed excellent UV blocking ability (85.2% of UV-A and 99.4% of UV-B) and 
high antioxidant effect (∼99% for ABTS and ∼ 58.6% for DPPH radical scavenging 
activity) and showed strong antibacterial activity to stop the growth (100%) of 
L. monocytogenes and to reduce the growth of E. coli by 8.1 log CFU/mL after 
12 h of incubation. In shrimp packaging experiments, the films were evident in 
the freshness monitoring, reduced spoilage, and increased shelf life. This study 
suggests that next-generation biopolymer films impregnated with biomass-derived 
CDs and natural colorants will provide broad directions for ensuring safety and 
extending shelf life to meet the accelerating demand for packaging products.

Climate warming has major consequences for animal populations, as ambient 
temperature profoundly influences all organisms' physiology, behavior, or both.1 
Body size in many organisms has been found to change with increased ambient 
temperatures due to influences on metabolism and/or access to 
resources.2,3,4,5,6 Changes in body size, in turn, can affect the dynamics and 
persistence of populations.7 Notably, in some species, body size has increased 
over the last decades in response to warmer temperatures.3,8 This has primarily 
been attributed to higher food availability,3 but might also result from 
metabolic savings in warmer environments.9,10 Bechstein's bats (Myotis 
bechsteinii) grow to larger body sizes in warmer summers,11 which affects their 
demography as larger females reproduce earlier at the expense of a shorter life 
expectancy.12,13 However, it remains unclear whether larger body sizes in warmer 
summers were due to thermoregulatory benefits or due to increased food 
availability. To disentangle these effects, we artificially heated communal day 
roosts of wild maternity colonies over four reproductive seasons. We used 
generalized mixed models to analyze these experimental results along with 25 
years of long-term data comprising a total of 741 juveniles. We found that 
individuals raised in heated roosts grew significantly larger than those raised 
in unheated conditions. This suggests that metabolic savings in warmer 
conditions lead to increased body size, potentially resulting in the decoupling 
of body growth from prey availability. Our study highlights a direct mechanism 
by which climate change may alter fitness-relevant traits, with potentially dire 
consequences for population persistence.

BACKGROUND: Social inequalities in adult mortality have been reported across 
diverse populations, but there is no large-scale prospective evidence from 
Mexico. We aimed to quantify social, including educational, inequalities in 
mortality among adults in Mexico City.
METHODS: The Mexico City Prospective Study recruited 150 000 adults aged 35 
years and older from two districts of Mexico City between 1998 and 2004. 
Participants were followed up until Jan 1, 2021 for cause-specific mortality. 
Cox regression analysis yielded rate ratios (RRs) for death at ages 35-74 years 
associated with education and examined, in exploratory analyses, the mediating 
effects of lifestyle and related risk factors.
FINDINGS: Among 143 478 participants aged 35-74 years, there was a strong 
inverse association of education with premature death. Compared with 
participants with tertiary education, after adjustment for age and sex, those 
with no education had about twice the mortality rate (RR 1·84; 95% CI 
1·71-1·98), equivalent to approximately 6 years lower life expectancy, with an 
RR of 1·78 (1·67-1·90) among participants with incomplete primary, 1·62 
(1·53-1·72) with complete primary, and 1·34 (1·25-1·42) with secondary 
education. Education was most strongly associated with death from renal disease 
and acute diabetic crises (RR 3·65; 95% CI 3·05-4·38 for no education vs 
tertiary education) and from infectious diseases (2·67; 2·00-3·56), but there 
was an apparent higher rate of death from all specific causes studied with lower 
education, with the exception of cancer for which there was little association. 
Lifestyle factors (ie, smoking, alcohol drinking, and leisure time physical 
activity) and related physiological correlates (ie, adiposity, diabetes, and 
blood pressure) accounted for about four-fifths of the association of education 
with premature mortality.
INTERPRETATION: In this Mexican population there were marked educational 
inequalities in premature adult mortality, which appeared to largely be 
accounted for by lifestyle and related risk factors. Effective interventions to 
reduce these risk factors could reduce inequalities and have a major impact on 
premature mortality.

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current status of 
osteoarthritis (OA) as one of the most common joint disorders worldwide. Despite 
being the 11th cause of disability globally, there has been an increase in the 
prevalence, annual incidence, and years lived with disability of OA, 
particularly in developed and developing countries. Erosive hand OA, which 
affects approximately 10% of the general population, has been associated with a 
higher clinical burden compared to non-erosive hand OA. Patients with knee and 
hip OA, but not hand OA, are also at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, OA has a significant contribution to 
healthcare costs in most countries. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has further 
exacerbated the disease burden of OA patients due to limited access to medical 
and surgical treatment. With increasing life expectancy and the aging of the 
global population, the burden of OA is expected to worsen. Therefore, this 
review highlights the importance of improving population and policymaker 
awareness of risk factors, such as obesity and injury, as well as early 
intervention and management of OA to control the future burden of the disease.

INTRODUCTION: The ever-increasing human life expectancy has currently resulted 
in a noticeable rise in the world's older population. Addressing the healthcare 
needs of the older people has become a significant concern for many countries. 
Moreover, the older people are particularly vulnerable to traumatic events. This 
study aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prehospital care 
provided by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for trauma-related cases among the 
older people in Iran.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved analyzing the medical records 
of 1,111 older people aged above 60 who experienced traumatic injuries and 
received pre-hospital emergency services from March 2018 to March 2022. In order 
to collect the data, the checklist made by the researcher was used and data 
analysis in SPSS16 was done using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: The age group of 60-74 received the highest number of services both 
before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The older men experienced more traumatic 
events compared to women throughout the study period. The majority of the 
traumatic events occurred between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. both before and after the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence rate of geriatric traumas can be primarily 
attributed to their physical problems and no control over movements caused by 
old age, as well as unsafe living conditions. To address these issues, it is 
suggested that facilities be provided to assist with mobility problems. 
Moreover, constructing suitable pedestrian bridges and regularly checking 
neighborhoods and surroundings to identify potential risk factors should be 
prioritized. Once these risk factors are identified, efforts can be made to 
adjust and eliminate them, thereby minimizing traumatic events and enhancing a 
safe and friendly environment for the older people.

BACKGROUND: Abiraterone (Abi) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor that 
significantly improves patients' life expectancy in metastatic prostate cancer 
(PCa). Despite its beneficial effects, many patients have baseline or acquired 
resistance against Abi. The aim of this study was to identify predictive serum 
biomarkers for Abi treatment.
METHODS: We performed a comparative proteome analysis on three Abi sensitive 
(LNCaPabl, LAPC4, DuCaP) and resistant (LNCaPabl-Abi, LAPC4-Abi, DuCaP-Abi) PCa 
cell lines using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
technique. Two bioinformatic selection workflows were applied to select the most 
promising candidate serum markers. Serum levels of selected proteins were 
assessed in samples of 100 Abi-treated patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant disease (mCRPC) using ELISA. Moreover, FSCN1 serum 
concentrations were measured in samples of 69 Docetaxel (Doc) treated mCRPC 
patients.
RESULTS: Our proteome analysis identified 68 significantly, at least two-fold 
upregulated proteins in Abi resistant cells. Using two filtering workflows four 
proteins (AMACR, KLK2, FSCN1 and CTAG1A) were selected for ELISA analyses. We 
found high baseline FSCN1 serum levels to be significantly associated with poor 
survival in Abi-treated mCRPC patients. Moreover, the multivariable analysis 
revealed that higher ECOG status (>1) and high baseline FSCN1 serum levels 
(>10.22 ng/ml by ROC cut-off) were independently associated with worse survival 
in Abi-treated patients (p < 0.001 and p = 0.021, respectively). In contrast, no 
association was found between serum FSCN1 concentrations and overall survival in 
Doc-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified baseline FSCN1 serum levels to be 
independently associated with poor survival of Abi-treated, but not Doc-treated 
mCRPC patients, suggesting a therapy specific prognostic value for FSCN1.

BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for guiding transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, a sizable proportion of TAVR 
candidates have chronic kidney disease, in whom the use of iodinated contrast 
media is a limitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a promising 
alternative, but randomized data comparing the effectiveness of CMR-guided 
versus CT-guided TAVR are lacking.
METHODS: An investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open-label, 
noninferiority trial was conducted at 2 Austrian heart centers. Patients 
evaluated for TAVR according to the inclusion criteria (severe symptomatic 
aortic stenosis) and exclusion criteria (contraindication to CMR, CT, or TAVR, a 
life expectancy <1 year, or chronic kidney disease level 4 or 5) were randomized 
(1:1) to undergo CMR or CT guiding. The primary outcome was defined according to 
the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 definition of implantation success at 
discharge, including absence of procedural mortality, correct positioning of a 
single prosthetic valve, and proper prosthetic valve performance. Noninferiority 
was assessed using a hybrid modified intention-to-treat/per-protocol approach on 
the basis of an absolute risk difference margin of 9%.
RESULTS: Between September 11, 2017, and December 16, 2022, 380 candidates for 
TAVR were randomized to CMR-guided (191 patients) or CT-guided (189 patients) 
TAVR planning. Of these, 138 patients (72.3%) in the CMR-guided group and 129 
patients (68.3%) in the CT-guided group eventually underwent TAVR (modified 
intention-to-treat cohort). Of these 267, 19 patients had protocol deviations, 
resulting in a per-protocol cohort of 248 patients (121 CMR-guided, 127 
CT-guided). In the modified intention-to-treat cohort, implantation success was 
achieved in 129 patients (93.5%) in the CMR group and in 117 patients (90.7%) in 
the CT group (between-group difference, 2.8% [90% CI, -2.7% to 8.2%]; P<0.01 for 
noninferiority). In the per-protocol cohort (n=248), the between-group 
difference was 2.0% (90% CI, -3.8% to 7.8%; P<0.01 for noninferiority).
CONCLUSIONS: CMR-guided TAVR was noninferior to CT-guided TAVR in terms of 
device implantation success. CMR can therefore be considered as an alternative 
for TAVR planning.
