There is a scarcity of studies that have investigated the role of multiple 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a range of muscle phenotypes in an 
elderly population. The present study investigated the possible association of 
24 SNPs with skeletal muscle phenotypes in 307 elderly Caucasian women (aged 
60-91 years, 66.3 ± 11.3 kg). Skeletal muscle phenotypes included biceps brachii 
thickness, vastus lateralis cross-sectional areas, maximal hand grip strength, 
isometric knee extension and elbow flexion torque. Genotyping for 24 SNPs, 
chosen on their skeletal muscle structural or functional links, was conducted on 
DNA extracted from blood or saliva. Of the 24 SNPs, 10 were associated with at 
least one skeletal muscle phenotype. HIF1A rs11549465 was associated with three 
skeletal muscle phenotypes and PTK2 rs7460 and ACVR1B rs10783485 were each 
associated with two phenotypes. PTK2 rs7843014, COL1A1 rs1800012, CNTF 
rs1800169, NOS3 rs1799983, MSTN rs1805086, TRHR rs7832552 and FTO rs9939609 were 
each associated with one. Elderly women possessing favourable genotypes were 
3.6-13.2% stronger and had 4.6-14.7% larger muscle than those with less 
favourable genotypes. These associations, together with future work involving a 
broader range of SNPs, may help identify individuals at particular risk of an 
age-associated loss of independence.

Malignancies heterogeneity represents a critical issue in cancer care, as it 
often causes therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Organoids are 
three-dimensional (3D) miniaturized representations of selected tissues within a 
dish. Lately, organoid technology has been applied to oncology with growing 
success and Patients Derived Tumor Organoids (PDTOs) constitute a novel 
available tool which fastens cancer research. PDTOs are in vitro models of 
cancer, and importantly, they can be used as a platform to validate the efficacy 
of anti-cancer drugs. For that reason, they are currently utilized in clinics as 
emerging in vitro screening technology to tailor the therapy around the patient, 
with the final goal of beating cancer resistance and recurrence. In this sense, 
PDTOs biobanking is widely used and PDTO-libraries are helping the discovery of 
novel anticancer molecules. Moreover, they represent a good model to screen and 
validate compounds employed for other pathologies as off-label drugs potentially 
repurposed for the treatment of tumors. This will open up novel avenues of care 
thus ameliorating the life expectancy of cancer patients. This review discusses 
the present advancements in organoids research applied to oncology, with special 
attention to PDTOs and their translational potential, especially for anti-cancer 
drug testing, including off-label molecules.

Cold expansion technology is an extended method used in aeronautics to increase 
fatigue life of holes and hence extending inspection intervals. During the cold 
expansion process, a mechanical mandrel is forced to pass along the hole 
generating compressive residual hoop stresses. The most widely accepted geometry 
for this mandrel is the tapered one and simpler options like balls have 
generally been rejected based on the non-conforming residual hoop stresses 
derived from their use. In this investigation a novelty process using multiple 
balls with incremental interference, instead of a single one, was simulated. 
Experimental tests were performed to validate the finite element method (FEM) 
models and residual hoop stresses from multiple balls simulation were compared 
with one ball and tapered mandrel simulations. Results showed that the use of 
three incremental balls significantly reduced the magnitude of non-conforming 
residual hoop stresses and the extension of these detrimental zone.

Background To explore the pathophysiological features of ischemic stroke in 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), we evaluated the association between 268 
plasma proteins and subsequent ischemic stroke in 2 large AF cohorts receiving 
oral anticoagulation. Methods and Results A case-cohort sample of patients with 
AF from the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic 
Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, including 282 cases with ischemic stroke 
or systemic embolism and a random sample of 4124 without these events, during 
1.9 years of follow-up was used for identification. Validation was provided by a 
similar case-cohort sample of patients with AF from the RE-LY (Randomized 
Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial, including 149 cases with 
ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and a random sample of 1062 without these 
events. In plasma obtained before randomization, 268 unique biomarkers were 
measured with OLINK proximity extension assay panels (CVD II, CVD III, and 
Inflammation) and conventional immunoassays. The association between biomarkers 
and outcomes was evaluated by random survival forest and adjusted Cox 
regression. According to random survival forest or Cox regression analyses, the 
biomarkers most strongly and consistently associated with ischemic 
stroke/systemic embolism were matrix metalloproteinase-9, NT-proBNP (N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), osteopontin, sortilin, soluble suppression of 
tumorigenesis 2, and trefoil factor-3. The corresponding hazard ratios (95% CIs) 
for an interquartile difference were as follows: 1.18 (1.00-1.38), 1.55 
(1.28-1.88), 1.28 (1.07-1.53), 1.19 (1.02-1.39), 1.23 (1.05-1.45), and 1.19 
(0.97-1.45), respectively. Conclusions In patients with AF, of 268 unique 
biomarkers, the 6 biomarkers most strongly associated with subsequent ischemic 
stroke/systemic embolism represent fibrosis/remodeling (matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 and soluble suppression of tumorigenesis 2), cardiac 
dysfunction (NT-proBNP), vascular calcification (osteopontin), metabolism 
(sortilin), and mucosal integrity/ischemia (trefoil factor-3). Registration URL:

A review of the available literature was performed in order to summarize the 
pathogenic and clinical connections between HIV infection and rheumatological 
syndromes. The increasing life expectancy during human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection has led to the observation of many rheumatological 
manifestations over the years in these types of patients. Although the 
pathological mechanisms are still not fully understood, several rheumatological 
diseases have been more commonly observed in the general population, especially 
after the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and sometimes 
clinical and serological findings are influenced by the underlying condition 
which defines a characteristic onset or development of the disease. Autoimmune 
diseases occur during specific stages of the HIV infection, depending on the 
underlying pathogenic mechanism being mainly influenced by the CD4+ cells count. 
Several rheumatological diseases show peculiar clinical manifestations 
influenced by the underlying HIV infection leading to specific features less 
commonly observed in the healthy population. Conversely to pathological 
findings, broadly, HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies (BnAb) observed in several 
autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, could play a protective role in HIV infection. 
It is important to evaluate the onset of autoimmune diseases in HIV patients in 
order to start the appropriate treatment to avoid harmful events. More studies 
are needed to enlighten the trend of autoimmune diseases during HIV infection. 
Pathogenic mechanisms and clinical manifestations of rheumatological diseases 
during HIV infection are discussed in this review.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have shorter life 
expectancy than people without SMI, mainly due to overmortality from physical 
diseases. They are treated by professionals in three different health and social 
care sectors with sparse collaboration between them, hampering coherent 
treatment. Previous studies have shown difficulties involved in establishing 
such collaboration. As the preparatory phase of an intervention to improve 
physical health of people with SMI and increase collaboration across sector 
borders, we explored different actors' experiences of barriers for 
collaboration.
METHOD: We collected qualitative data from patients, professionals in general 
practice, psychiatry and social psychiatry involved in the treatment of these 
patients. Data consisted of notes from meetings and observations, interviews, 
focus groups and workshops. Analysis was by Interpretative Phenomenological 
Analysis.
RESULTS: The study revealed many obstacles to collaboration and coherent 
treatment, including the consultation structures in general practice, sectors 
being subject to different legislation, and incompatible IT systems. 
Professionals in general practice and social psychiatry felt that they were left 
with the responsibility for actions taken by hospital psychiatry without 
opportunity to discuss their concerns with psychiatrists. There were also 
cultural differences between health care and social psychiatry, expressed in 
ideology and language. Social psychiatry had an existential approach to 
recovery, whereas the views of health professionals were linked to symptom 
control and based on outcomes. Meanwhile, patients were left in limbo between 
these separate ideologies with no leadership in place to promote dialogue and 
integrate treatments between the sectors.
CONCLUSION: Many obstacles to integrated trans-sectoral treatment of patients 
with SMI seem related to a lack of an overriding leadership and organizational 
support to establish collaboration and remove barriers related to legislation 
and IT. However, professional and ideological barriers also contribute. 
Psychiatry does not consider general practice to be part of the treatment team 
although general practitioners are left with responsibility for decisions taken 
in psychiatry; and different ideologies and treatment principles in psychiatry 
and municipal social psychiatry hamper the dialogue between them. There is a 
need to rethink the organization to avoid that the three sectors live autonomous 
lives with different cultures and lack of collaboration.

In de novo molecular design, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been shown to 
be effective methods for sampling and generating novel chemical structures. 
Using a technique called reinforcement learning (RL), an RNN can be tuned to 
target a particular section of chemical space with optimized desirable 
properties using a scoring function. However, ligands generated by current RL 
methods so far tend to have relatively low diversity, and sometimes even result 
in duplicate structures when optimizing towards desired properties. Here, we 
propose a new method to address the low diversity issue in RL for molecular 
design. Memory-assisted RL is an extension of the known RL, with the 
introduction of a so-called memory unit. As proof of concept, we applied our 
method to generate structures with a desired AlogP value. In a second case 
study, we applied our method to design ligands for the dopamine type 2 receptor 
and the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1A receptor. For both receptors, a machine 
learning model was developed to predict whether generated molecules were active 
or not for the receptor. In both case studies, it was found that memory-assisted 
RL led to the generation of more compounds predicted to be active having higher 
chemical diversity, thus achieving better coverage of chemical space of known 
ligands compared to established RL methods.

BACKGROUND: While the world's population is growing older, healthy life 
expectancy is not increasing. The Japanese Orthopedic Association proposed the 
concept of 'locomotive syndrome,' manifested as a decline in mobility functions, 
and introduced a short test battery for assessing the risk of this syndrome. The 
test battery includes the 'stand-up test,' 'two-step test,' and '25-question 
Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale' (25-question GLFS). The purpose of 
locomotion training is to improve and sustain standing and gait functions. 
However, the place where locomotion training can be provided and followed up has 
not been decided upon. Therefore, a study was conducted to explore the effect of 
locomotive syndrome improvement by continuous locomotion training provided at 
community pharmacies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
pharmacists' instructions and follow-up on the compliance and effectiveness of 
locomotion training.
METHODS: The inclusion criteria were 1) age ≥ 65 years and 2) decline in 
mobility functions. Guidance on how to perform locomotion training was provided 
by a pharmacist at the pharmacy. The participants performed locomotion training 
at home. They were tested and instructed at the pharmacy once a month for 
3 months. The main outcome measures were test battery results and the percentage 
of number of days participants who were able to do the training at home.
RESULTS: Eleven participants were analysed. The minimum implementation 
percentage was 78%. Improvements were observed in 25-question GLFS, muscle 
strength, and standing time on one leg. Three participants no longer showed a 
noticeable decline in mobility function.
CONCLUSION: Continuous locomotion training provided at pharmacies could 
contribute to locomotive syndrome prevention.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the University hospital 
Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR; identification 
No. UMIN000027963 . Registered 28 June 2017).

Although the "stay-at-home" order is advocated against the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19), the lives of individuals lacking adequate housing are 
threatened. We developed a framework to assess various populations with unstable 
housing in terms of socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, risk of COVID-19 
infection and progression, existing/urgent measures, and remaining challenges. 
Within the framework, nine groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan were 
classified into (i) "people without accommodation," (ii) "people living in 
temporary or crisis accommodation," and (iii) populations that include "people 
living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation." The assessment 
revealed that "staying at home" was physically and practically unattainable 
across groups. The study identified specific institutional, social, and cultural 
challenges apart from the common economic crisis, whereas the utilization of 
social welfare was low. Findings suggest that the rapid increase of groups 
classified as "(i)" and "(ii)" should be addressed by engaging stakeholders to 
enhance the availability and accessibility of social welfare and rescue 
measures, and to ensure safe and private accommodations for all groups. It is 
critical to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to the common and 
specific vulnerabilities of these population groups from health, socio-economic, 
and humanitarian perspectives. Under the pandemic, homelessness should be 
regarded less as a peculiar problem for specific populations but an extension of 
daily life. The framework can be a reference when planning the comprehensive yet 
concise assessment of populations with unstable housing in other countries to 
inform responses to the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Most often in Canada, the evaluation and management of abnormal 
uterine bleeding occurs under general anesthesia in the operating room. We aimed 
to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of an outpatient uterine assessment 
and treatment unit (UATU) compared with the current standard of care when 
diagnosing and treating abnormal uterine bleeding in women.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis and developed a 
probabilistic decision tree model to simulate the total costs and outcomes of 
women receiving outpatient UATU or usual care over a 1-year time horizon (Apr. 
1, 2014, to Mar. 31, 2017) at a tertiary care hospital in Ontario, Canada. 
Probabilities, resource use and time to diagnosis and treatment were obtained 
from a retrospective chart review of 200 randomly selected women who presented 
with abnormal uterine bleeding. Results were expressed as overall cost and time 
savings per patient. Costs are reported in 2018 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, care in the UATU was associated with a 
decrease in overall cost ($1332, 95% confidence interval [CI] -$1742 to -$1008) 
and a decrease in overall time to treatment (-75, 95% CI -89 to -63, d). The 
point at which the UATU would no longer be cost saving is if the additional cost 
to operate and maintain the UATU is greater than $1600 per patient.
INTERPRETATION: From the perspective of Canada's health care system, an 
outpatient UATU is more cost effective than usual care and saves time. Future 
studies should focus on the relative efficacy of a UATU and the total budget 
required to operate and maintain a UATU.

OBJECTIVE: As cases of COVID-19 infections surge, concerns have renewed about 
intensive care units (ICUs) being overwhelmed and the need for specific triage 
protocols over winter. This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by 
exploring the views of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Online survey between 29th of May and 22nd of 
June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from 
existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. 
Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two 
patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: 
chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, 
disability and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing 
one patient to treat or tossing a coin to decide.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents 
prioritised patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72%-93%), 
longer life expectancy (78%-83%), required shorter duration of treatment 
(88%-94%), were younger (71%-79%) or had a lesser degree of frailty 
(60%-69%, all p<0.001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, 
a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A 
majority (58%-86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in 
intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently 
presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give 
higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children.
CONCLUSION: Members of the UK general public potentially support a broadly 
utilitarian approach to ICU triage in the face of overwhelming need. Survey 
respondents endorsed the relevance of patient factors currently included in 
triage guidance, but also factors not currently included. They supported the 
permissibility of reallocating treatment in a pandemic.

Age-related changes in physical function are attracting attention in Japan. 
Sarcopenia is known as the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in the 
elderly. Secondary sarcopenia due to neuromuscular disorders should be 
considered in patients with sarcopenia. Providing appropriate medical care for 
patients with neuromuscular disorders will extend healthy life expectancy. In 
this review, previous studies on age-related changes in the neuromuscular system 
were summarized and the common neuromuscular disorders in the oldest-old were 
reviewed.

The number of super-aged people over 80 years has increased with the life 
expectancy; however, studies on their psychiatric disorders are lacking. The 
characteristics of psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often complicated by 
physical diseases and organic changes in the brain. Psychiatric symptoms change 
atypically and rapidly. In the oldest-old, it is difficult to hear about the 
present condition of the patient and the aging process complicates drug therapy. 
In this paper, I outlined the diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments of: 1. 
psychotic disorders in the oldest-old including (A) schizophrenia comprised of 
(i) schizophrenia in late life and (ii) late-onset schizophrenia, (B) delusional 
disorder, (C) catatonia, and (D) late-onset psychotic disorders (conventional 
diagnosis); 2. depression; 3. apathy; 4. anxiety disorder; and 5. somatoform 
disorder.

The fovea is a pit formed in the center of the retina that enables high-acuity 
vision in certain vertebrate species. While formation of the fovea fascinates 
many researchers, the molecular mechanisms underlying foveal development are 
poorly understood. In the current study, we histologically investigated foveal 
development in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and found that foveal pit 
formation begins just before post-hatch day 14 (P14). We next performed RNA-seq 
analysis to compare gene expression profiles between the central (foveal and 
parafoveal) and peripheral retina in zebra finch at P14. We found that the 
Arhgef33 expression is enriched in the middle layer of the inner nuclear layer 
at the parafovea, suggesting that Arhgef33 is dominantly expressed in Müller 
glial cells in the developing parafovea. We then performed a pull-down assay 
using Rhotekin-RBD and observed GEF activity of Arhgef33 against RhoA. We found 
that overexpression of Arhgef33 in HEK293 cells induces cell contraction and 
that Arhgef33 expression inhibits neurite extension in Neuro 2A cells, which is 
partially recovered by a Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. Taken together, we used 
zebra finch as a model animal to investigate foveal development and identified 
Arhgef33 as a candidate protein possibly involved in foveal development through 
modulating RhoA activity.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the midterm results of a 
brachio-axillary arteriovenous graft (BA-AVG) for the provision of vascular 
access haemodialysis patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort retrospective consecutive single-centre study of 
46 patients undergoing BA-AVG using the Gore Acuseal, from November 2015 to 
October 2019 was conducted. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, medical 
therapy, and complications were collated for the initial endpoints of primary 
patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency. A subgroup analysis 
included outcomes in patients over 70 years old and events (complications) per 
AVG per year. Data were subjected to Kaplan-Meier survival estimator with 
log-rank analysis and test of probability.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 63.5 years with male predominance (male, 
n = 27, 59%). A total of 37 (80%) patient procedures were conducted with 
elective settings as well as on an emergency basis with a 91.3% technical 
success rate. The most common complication was grade I steal syndrome (8.7%), 
followed by graft infections (4.3%), median nerve neuropraxia (4.3%), and 
postoperative bleeding (2%), demonstrating a 0.1 per AVG complication per 2 
years. Median primary patency, primary assisted patency, and secondary patency 
over a mean follow-up period of 28 months was 5.5, 12.5, and 18 months, 
respectively, with no associated 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: BA-AVG with midterm longevity and low complications may serve as an 
alternative access type when a suitable site is not identified. The AVG patency 
rate in the elderly or patients with limited life expectancy is promising. 
However, more robust data are needed to confirm the benefit of AVG in this 
cohort.

BACKGROUND: Nocturia is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) 
and can significantly reduce men's quality of life. It is often poorly managed 
with conventional treatments.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the self-assessed benefits 
of a prostate health dietary combination formulation on mild LUTS, especially 
nocturia in healthy males.
METHODS: In an open label clinical study, thirty healthy male subjects with mild 
LUTS took one daily capsule of the product for 60 days. The primary outcome was 
self-assessed severity of LUTS using the International Prostate Symptoms Score 
(IPSS) questionnaire at Day 1 (baseline), Day 30 and Day 60. Safety and 
compliance were also evaluated.
RESULTS: At Day 60, IPSS significantly decreased from baseline by 16.3% 
(3.6 ± 2.1 vs. 4.3 ± 1.5, p < 0.05). Although the reduction in IPSS did not 
reach statistical significance at Day 30, it was mostly driven by a 30.7% 
decrease (p < 0.05) in the nocturia sub-score compared with baseline. While 37% 
of subjects reported at baseline waking up 2‒3 times/night to void, none did so 
after taking the study product for 60 days. Compliance was very high throughout 
the study. No adverse events related to the study product were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The study product might be a safe alternative for individuals 
willing to explore a non-conventional approach to manage their nocturia. A 
larger randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial is warranted to confirm 
these results. Clinical trial registry: Clinical Trials.gov. Registration number 
(September 1st, 2016): NCT02886832.

University, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.

AIM: Stroke is one of the major health challenges affecting life expectancy and 
quality of life around the world. However, there is limited reporting on the 
status of some caregivers, including Chinese caregivers of stroke inpatients. 
Limited information is available on evaluations using the World Health 
Organization Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL) and the effects of resilience 
and self-efficacy on WHOQOL score. Therefore, we conducted research to assess 
the role of resilience on the WHOQOL and to investigate the role of 
self-efficacy as a mediator between resilience and WHOQOL score among Chinese 
caregivers of stroke inpatients.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study to gather data from north-east and 
south-east China was conducted from June 2019 to October 2019. Over 380 
caregivers of stroke inpatients at two general public hospitals were interviewed 
face-to-face. About 305 caregivers (80.26%) completed the questionnaire, which 
included the Ego Resilience Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the 
brief version of the WHOQOL and asked about demographic characteristics. This 
study also examined factors associated with WHOQOL score and used linear 
regression analysis and structure equation modelling to construct direct and 
indirect models, respectively.
RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic characteristics, both resilience and 
self-efficacy were positively associated with all WHOQOL domains. Structure 
equation modelling revealed that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between 
resilience and WHOQOL score among caregivers of stroke inpatients.
CONCLUSION: Chinese caregivers of stroke inpatients exhibited good social health 
but poor physical, psychological, and environmental health. It is necessary for 
promoting resilience and improving WHOQOL score through the mediating effect of 
self-efficacy. These results suggest that interventions in health care focused 
on both enhancing resilience and providing self-efficacy training could 
effectively improve WHOQOL score.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to estimate the cumulative incidence rate 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Taiwanese population ages 16-84 years, and 
life expectancy, loss of life expectancy, and lifetime health care expenditures 
for incident RA in Taiwan after 2003, when biologics began to be prescribed.
METHODS: We obtained all claims data for the period 1999 to 2016 from the 
National Health Insurance program of Taiwan, and validated the data against the 
Catastrophic Illness Registry to establish the study cohort. We estimated the 
survival function for RA and extrapolated to lifetime using a rolling-over 
algorithm. For every RA case, we simulated sex-, age-, and calendar year-matched 
referents from vital statistics and estimated their life expectancy. The 
difference between the life expectancy of the referent and the life expectancy 
of the RA patient was the loss of life expectancy for the RA patient. Average 
monthly health care expenditures were multiplied by the corresponding survival 
rates and summed up throughout the lifetime to calculate the lifetime health 
care expenditures.
RESULTS: A total of 29,352 new RA cases were identified during 2003-2016. There 
was a decreasing trend in cumulative incidence rate in those ages 16-84 for both 
sexes. Mean life expectancy after diagnosis of RA was 26.3 years, and mean 
lifetime cost was $72,953. RA patients had a mean loss of life expectancy of 
4.97 years. Women with RA survived 1-2 years longer than men with RA of the same 
age, which resulted in higher lifetime expenditures for the former. Since the 
life expectancy for women in Taiwan was 6-7 years higher than that for men, the 
loss of life expectancy for women with RA was higher than that for men with RA. 
Annual health care expenditures were similar for both sexes.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that since biologics became available, RA 
patients have lived longer and had higher lifetime expenditures, which should be 
monitored and evaluated for cost-effectiveness.

Characterization of Deaths from Cirrhosis of the Liver in Cuba, 1987-2017.

Pedroso-Flaquet P, Alfonso-Sagué K, J S.

INTRODUCTION Cirrhosis of the liver is a chronic disease that is widespread and 
irreversible. It represents the fi nal stage of numerous diseases that affect 
the liver. By the end of 2017, it was the 11th most common cause of death, with 
a loss of 41.4 million years of disability-adjusted life years, which represent 
2.1% of the total years of life lost in the global mortality burden. In Cuba, 
cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases have been among the top 10 causes of 
death for several decades, their rates consistently increasing, from 576 deaths 
in 1970 (6.7 per 100,000 population) to 1738 in 2017 (15.5 per 100,000 
population), with a risk of death that is 4.6 times higher in men. OBJECTIVE 
Characterize deaths from cirrhosis of the liver in Cuba from 1987 to 2017. 
METHODS An ecological time-series study was conducted for 1987 to 2017 using 
information obtained from the mortality database of the Medical Records and 
Health Statistics Bureau of Cuba's Ministry of Public Health. The study universe 
consisted of all deceased persons in the country whose underlying cause of death 
was cirrhosis of the liver. Both general mortality rates and specifi c mortality 
were calculated by age group, sex and etiological classifi cation using adjusted 
and crude rates. Rates were age-adjusted using the direct method, and the 
population from the 2002 Census of Population and Housing was considered as the 
standard population. Percentages and means were also calculated according to 
selected variables and the relative risk of death due to the disease according 
to sex, age group and etiological classifi cation. The trend and forecast for 
mortality rates were estimated for this disease. RESULTS The crude mortality 
rate from cirrhosis of the liver was 9.0 per 100,000 population for the period. 
Those aged ≥75 years had the highest risk of death (48.3 per 100,000 
population). The crude and adjusted mortality rates were almost double for men 
(12.4 vs. 5.6 and 11.7 vs. 5.6 per 100,000 population, respectively), as was the 
total relative risk of death, which was 2.2 times higher. Nonalcoholic cirrhosis 
accounted for 71.6% of deaths. By the end of 2017, risk of death from cirrhosis 
had climbed to 14.8 per 100,000 population (adjusted rate: 10.6 per 100,000 
population), a signal that mortality had progressively increased over the 31 
years analyzed. In addition, forecasts predict that death rates will continue 
their gradual increase, reaching 19.2 per 100,000 population in 2025. 
CONCLUSIONS Deaths from cirrhosis of the liver constitute a substantial health 
burden in Cuba. The upward trend and forecast, in addition to increased risk of 
mortality in men and older adults, are similar to those reported 
internationally. The fi nding that most of these deaths result from nonalcoholic 
cirrhosis should be further studied, as formulation of effective public health 
strategies depends largely on attaining a better understanding of the etiology, 
progression and social determinants of the disease. KEYWORDS Liver cirrhosis,

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a globally relevant health problem, which places a 
great burden on patients and their families. This study aimed to estimate the 
burden associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias in Brazil.
METHODS: In this descriptive study, we investigated the estimates obtained by 
the Global Burden of Disease study. We described the prevalence of AD and other 
dementias, years lived with disability (YLDs), age-standardized mortality, years 
of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) among 
individuals aged 60 years or older between 2000 and 2016, with their respective 
95% uncertainty intervals (95%UI).
RESULTS: During this period, the age-standardized prevalence of AD and other 
dementias per 100,000 people increased by 7.8%, from 961.7 (95%UI 828.3-1,117.5) 
to 1,036.9 (95%UI 882.0-1,219.5), with approximately 1.5 million people living 
with dementia in Brazil. The incidence increased by 4.5%. Similarly, all 
age-standardized rates had an upward trend (mortality: 3.1%; YLLs: 5.8%; YLDs: 
7.9%; and DALYs: 6.3%). Mortality profiles increased with age in both years.
