A deficiency in Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein results in motor neuron loss 
in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. Human SMN is encoded by SMN1 and SMN2 
that differ by a single C6T transition in a splice regulatory region of exon 7. 
In SMN2, exon 7 is skipped leading to an unstable protein, which cannot 
compensate for SMN1 loss in SMA patients. The disease severity of human SMA 
(Types 1-4) depends on the levels of SMN protein, with intermediate levels 
leading to delayed disease onset and extended life expectancy in Type 2 
patients. We used homology directed repair (HDR) to generate a zebrafish mutant 
with intermediate Smn levels, to mimic intermediate, hSMN2 dependent forms of 
SMA. In the obtained smnA6Tind27 mutant zebrafish, Smn protein formed oligomers 
but protein levels dropped significantly at juvenile stages. Motor neurons and 
neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) also formed normally initially but motor neuron 
loss and locomotor deficiencies became evident at 21 days. Subsequent muscle 
wasting and early adult lethality also phenocopied intermediate forms of human 
SMA. Together, our findings are consistent with the interpretation that Smn is 
required for neuromuscular maintenance, and establish the smnA6Tind27 zebrafish 
mutant as a novel model for intermediate types of SMA. As this mutant allows 
studying the effect of late Smn loss on motor neurons, neuromuscular junctions, 
and muscle at advanced stages of the disease, it will be a valuable resource for 
testing new drugs targeted towards treating intermediate forms of SMA.

BACKGROUND: Due to trisomy of chromosome 21 and the resultant extra copy of the 
amyloid precursor protein gene, nearly all adults with Down syndrome develop 
Alzheimer's disease pathology by the age of 40 years and are at high risk for 
dementia given their increased life expectancy compared with adults with Down 
syndrome in the past. We aimed to compare CSF biomarker patterns in Down 
syndrome with those of carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease 
mutations to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms in these two 
genetic groups at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study using data from adults enrolled in the 
Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) study, a multisite 
longitudinal study of Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome, as well as a cohort 
of carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations and non-carrier 
sibling controls enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) 
study. For ABC-DS, participants with baseline CSF, available clinical diagnosis, 
and apolipoprotein E genotype as of Jan 31, 2019, were included in the analysis. 
DIAN participants with baseline CSF, available clinical diagnosis, and 
apolipoprotein E genotype as of June 30, 2018, were evaluated as comparator 
groups. CSF samples obtained from adults with Down syndrome, similarly aged 
carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations, and non-carrier 
siblings (aged 30-61 years) were analysed for markers of amyloid β (Aβ1-40, 
Aβ1-42); tau phosphorylated at threonine 181-related processes; neuronal, 
axonal, or synaptic injury (total tau, visinin-like protein 1, neurofilament 
light chain [NfL], synaptosomal-associated protein 25); and astrogliosis and 
neuroinflammation (chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]) via immunoassay. 
Biomarker concentrations were compared as a function of dementia status 
(asymptomatic or symptomatic), and linear regression was used to evaluate and 
compare the relationship between biomarker concentrations and age among groups.
FINDINGS: We assessed CSF samples from 341 individuals (178 [52%] women, 163 
[48%] men, aged 30-61 years). Participants were adults with Down syndrome 
(n=41), similarly aged carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease 
mutations (n=192), and non-carrier siblings (n=108). Individuals with Down 
syndrome had patterns of Alzheimer's disease-related CSF biomarkers remarkably 
similar to carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations, 
including reductions (all p<0·0080) in Aβ1-42 to Aβ1-40 ratio and increases in 
markers of phosphorylated tau-related processes; neuronal, axonal, and synaptic 
injury (p<0·080); and astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, with greater degrees 
of abnormality in individuals with dementia. Differences included overall higher 
concentrations of Aβ and YKL-40 (both p<0·0008) in Down syndrome and potential 
elevations in CSF tau (p<0·010) and NfL (p<0·0001) in the asymptomatic stage 
(ie, no dementia symptoms).

The residual chlorine disinfectants (CDs) in swine slurry could negatively 
impact the anaerobic digestion (AD). The objective of this study was to 
investigate the effects of CDs on mesophilic and thermophilic AD. The results 
indicated that CDs exerted inhibition effects on methanogenesis at the initial 
stage of mesophilic AD, leading to the extension of lag time from 0.62 days for 
control to 0.85, 1.9, 3.8, and 5.5 days with the increasing CDs concentrations 
of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L, respectively. Under thermophilic condition, the 
inhibition effects reduced significantly at the initial stage but a decrease of 
CMPu at later stage was observed. The microbial analysis revealed that CDs 
resulted in the enrichment of chlorine-resistant bacteria 
(Clostridum_sensu_stricto_1) and archaea (Methanosarcina). Addition of activated 
carbon (AC), zero-valent iron (ZVI) and biochar (BC) was evaluated for 
alleviating the inhibitions of CDs and proved to be feasible strategies to 
alleviate the inhibited AD.

BACKGROUND: Low muscle strength has been focused on as an essential 
characteristic of sarcopenia, and the 30-s chair stand test (CS-30) could be a 
particularly useful test for assessing muscle strength. While it is speculated 
to be a beneficial tool for the assessment of sarcopenia, this remains to be 
verified. In this study, we examined the reliability and optimal diagnostic 
score of the CS-30 for assessing sarcopenia in elderly Japanese participants.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 678 participants (443 females and 
235 males) who underwent the test for sarcopenia as per the Asian Working Group 
for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019, the CS-30 test, and the isometric knee-extension 
muscle strength test. ROC analysis was used to estimate the optimal CS-30 scores 
at which sarcopenia was detected.
RESULTS: CS-30 scores were positively associated with sarcopenia (OR: 0.88; 95% 
CI:0.82-0.93). The AUC of the CS-30 for sarcopenia definition were 0.84 
(p < 0.001) for females and 0.80 (p < 0.001) for males. The optimal number of 
stands in the CS-30 that predicted sarcopenia was 15 for females (sensitivity, 
76.4%; specificity, 76.8%) and 17 for males (sensitivity, 75.0%; specificity, 
71.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: The CS-30 was found to be a reliable test for sarcopenia screening 
in the elderly Japanese population.

Harmful algal bloom events are increasing in a number of water bodies around the 
world with significant economic impacts on the aquaculture, fishing and tourism 
industries. As well as their potential impacts on human health, toxin exposure 
from harmful algal blooms (HABs) has resulted in widespread morbidity and 
mortality in marine life, including top marine predators. There is therefore a 
need for an improved understanding of the trophic transfer, and persistence of 
toxins in marine food webs. For the first time, the concentrations of two toxin 
groups of commercial and environmental importance, domoic acid (DA) and 
saxitoxin (including Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) analogues), were measured 
in the viscera of 40 different fish species caught in Scotland between February 
and November, 2012 to 2019. Overall, fish had higher concentrations of DA 
compared to PSTs, with a peak in the summer / autumn months. Whole fish 
concentrations were highest in pelagic species including Atlantic mackerel and 
herring, key forage fish for marine predators including seals, cetaceans and 
seabirds. The highest DA concentrations were measured along the east coast of 
Scotland and in Orkney. PSTs showed highest concentrations in early summer, 
consistent with phytoplankton bloom timings. The detection of multiple toxins in 
such a range of demersal, pelagic and benthic fish prey species suggests that 
both the fish, and by extension, piscivorous marine predators, experience 
multiple routes of toxin exposure. Risk assessment models to understand the 
impacts of exposure to HAB toxins on marine predators therefore need to consider 
how chronic, low-dose exposure to multiple toxins, as well as acute exposure 
during a bloom, could lead to potential long-term health effects ultimately 
contributing to mortalities. The potential synergistic, neurotoxic and 
physiological effects of long-term exposure to multiple toxins require 
investigation in order to appropriately assess the risks of HAB toxins to fish 
as well as their predators.

Serum albumin shows slow clearance from circulation due to neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn)-mediated recycling and has been used for half-life extension. We report 
here fusions to a high-affinity DARPin, binding to Epithelial Cell Adhesion 
Molecule (EpCAM). We developed a novel, efficient expression system for such 
fusion proteins in Pichia pastoris with titers above 300 mg/L of lab-scale 
shake-flask culture. Since human serum albumin (HSA) does not bind to the murine 
FcRn, half-lives of therapeutic candidates are frequently measured in human FcRn 
transgenic mice, limiting useable tumor models. Additionally, serum albumins 
with extended half-life have been designed. We tested HSA7, motivated by its 
previously claimed extraordinarily long half-life in mice, which we could not 
confirm. Instead, we determined a half-life of only 29 h for HSA7, comparable to 
MSA. The fusion of HSA7 to a DARPin showed a similar half-life. To rationalize 
these findings, we measured binding kinetics and affinities to murine and human 
FcRn. Briefly, HSA7 showed affinity to murine FcRn only in the micromolar range, 
comparable to MSA to its cognate murine FcRn, and an affinity in the nanomolar 
range only to the human FcRn. This explains the comparable half-life of MSA and 
HSA7 in mice, while wild-type-HSA has a half-life of only 21 h, as it does not 
bind the murine FcRn and is not recycled. Thus, HSA-fusions with improved 
FcRn-affinity, such as HSA7, can be used for preclinical experiments in mice 
when FcRn transgenes cannot be used, as they reflect better the complex 
FcRn-mediated recycling and distribution mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: This meta-analytic review aimed to systematically evaluate 
associations of depression with multiple gender role dimensions (masculinity, 
femininity, androgyny, and undifferentiated traits) and to determine potential 
moderators (participant characteristics, study instruments and sociocultural 
factors) of the relationship.
METHODS: Of 4481 initially identified records in three electronic databases, 58 
studies published 1978 to 2021 were included for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: (1) Association of depression and gender role is moderated by study 
year and human development indices. (2) Masculinity is a protective factor for 
depression, while this dominance has declined as life expectancy increases. (3) 
A negative, weak but significant association between depression and femininity 
is observed in women, and college students, which starts to emerge with the 
gradual increase in the national education and income index from 1990 to 2019. 
(4) Androgynous individuals reported the lowest level of depression as compared 
with other gender role orientations (masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated 
trait group). This disparity is becoming more extreme with life expectancy and 
per capita income index increases.
LIMITATIONS: English-language studies were only included in this review.
CONCLUSIONS: Androgyny might be the most ideal gender role protecting both women 
and men from depression.

Objective: To estimate the healthy life expectancy (HALE) of registered 
residents in Jing'an District, Shanghai City. Methods: From June to August in 
2017, 14 districts (towns) were selected as the research sites, and 4 159 
registered residents were selected as the subjects. The health status data of 
subjects were collected by using the self-rated health scale, and the health 
rate of subjects was obtained by using the CHOPIT model. The health rate of 
residents under 18 years old was replaced by the parameters of 18-year-old 
group, and Sullivan method was used to calculate the HALE of registered 
residents in Jing'an District, Shanghai City. Results: The age of 4 159 subjects 
was (56.46±15.19) years old, ranging from 18 to 98 years old. There were 1 768 
males (42.5%). The overall health rate of subjects was 74.96%, of which the 
health rates of male and female were 76.87% and 72.45% respectively. With the 
increase of age, the health rate decreased (Z=265.51, P<0.001), and the health 
rate of male was higher than that of female (χ²=2 154.54, P<0.001). The HALE of 
the 0-year-old group was 64.29 years old, in which the male and female were 
66.25 and 63.57 years old respectively. Among the 18-year-old group, the HALE 
was 48.18 years old, with 49.07 years old for male and 47.46 years old for 
female. The HALE of male was higher than that of female in all age groups. With 
the increase of age, the HALE decreased gradually. Conclusion: There are 
significant sex and age differences in HALE in Jing'an District, Shanghai City. 
The health issue of female and older people should be given more attention.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that affects the 
skin, musculoskeletal structures and other organs and systems compromising 
functionality, quality of life and reducing the life expectancy of patients. It 
is a complex disease that requires specialist and timely care and management. 
The alternatives for treating the manifestations of psoriatic arthritis have 
increased and the effect of the different agents on specific manifestations has 
been clarified in recent studies. Therefore, we should incorporate the available 
evidence to build a strategy for the treatment of these patients. The Mexican 
College of Rheumatology selected a committee to evaluate these different 
alternatives and make recommendations.
METHODS: The study group included 16 rheumatologists and 3 certified 
dermatologists, selected from different health institutions and regions of the 
country. An executive committee was formed to coordinate the meetings and a 
committee of experts selected the literature search criteria, prepared the 
research questions, rated the quality of the evidence, and produced the 
recommendations in the different disease domains based on the GRADE methodology.
RESULTS: 24 updated recommendations were generated for the treatment of patients 
with psoriatic arthritis. The recommendations establish the role of the drugs 
currently available in our country. The importance of adequate disease control 
is emphasized, individualizing the level of involvement of each patient in each 
of the six domains potentially affected by the disease. In addition, the 
sequence in the choice of treatments available for each domain is established, 
based on their efficacy, safety profile and accessibility.
CONCLUSIONS: With this consensus document, it will be possible to improve the 
care of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The recommendations were generated 
based on the best available information and in consideration of the Mexican 
health system.

This case-based discussion describes a 65-year-old man newly diagnosed with 
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 prostate cancer 
(PCa). According to the European Association of Urology classification system, 
the patient harbors an intermediate-risk cancer. In step-by step discussion, we 
elaborate guideline-based treatment modalities for intermediate-risk PCa focused 
on debating active surveillance versus active treatment. Thereby, we discuss the 
importance of patient characteristics, including age, hereditary factors, life 
expectancy and comorbidity status, findings of multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging, as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density and PSA 
kinetics, in predicting the clinical course of the disease. In addition, we 
focus on cribriform pathology as a predictor of adverse outcomes and critically 
discuss its relevance in patient management. Lastly, we outline genomic 
stratification in ISUP 2 cancer as a future tool to predict PCa aggressiveness. 
PATIENT SUMMARY: Based on current guidelines, patients with intermediate-risk 
prostate cancer are treated actively or can alternatively undergo an active 
surveillance approach when favorable risk factors are present. One major issue 
is to discriminate between patients who benefit from an active therapy approach 
and those who benefit from a deferred treatment. Therefore, reliable biomarkers 
and early predictors of disease progression are needed urgently.

The potential therapeutic value of many proteins is ultimately limited by their 
rapid in vivo clearance. One strategy to limit clearance by metabolism and 
excretion, and improving the stability of therapeutic proteins, is their fusion 
to the immunoglobulin fragment crystallizable region (Fc). The Fc region plays 
multiple roles in (i) dimerization for the formation of "Y"-shaped structure of 
Ig, (ii) Fc-mediated effector functions, (iii) extension of serum half-life, and 
(iv) a cost-effective purification tag. Plants and in particular Nicotiana 
benthamiana have proven to be suitable expression platforms for several 
recombinant therapeutic proteins. Despite the enormous success of their use for 
the production of full-length monoclonal antibodies, the expression of Fc-fused 
therapeutic proteins in plants has shown limitations. Many Fc-fusion proteins 
expressed in plants show different degrees of instability resulting in high 
amounts of Fc-derived degradation products. To address this issue, we used 
erythropoietin (EPO) as a reporter protein and evaluated the efforts to enhance 
the expression of full-length EPO-Fc targeted to the apoplast of N. benthamiana. 
Our results show that the instability of the fusion protein is independent from 
the Fc origin or IgG subclass and from the peptide sequence used to link the two 
domains. We also show that a similar instability occurs upon the expression of 
individual heavy chains of monoclonal antibodies and ScFv-Fc that mimic the 
"Y"-shape of antibodies but lack the light chain. We propose that in this 
configuration, steric hindrance between the protein domains leads to physical 
instability. Indeed, mutations of critical residues located on the Fc 
dimerization interface allowed the expression of fully stable EPO monomeric 
Fc-fusion proteins. We discuss the limitations of Fc-fusion technology in N. 
benthamiana transient expression systems and suggest strategies to optimize the 
Fc-based scaffolds on their folding and aggregation resistance in order to 
improve the stability.

Due to the increase in the aged population and increased life expectancy, the 
underlying mechanisms involved in the aging process and cell senescence and the 
ways for modulating these processes in age-related diseases become important. 
One of the main mechanisms involved in aging and cell senescence, especially in 
the diseases related to aging, is the oxidative stress process and the following 
inflammation. Hence, the effects of antioxidants are highlighted in the 
literature due to their beneficial impacts on inhibiting telomere shortening or 
DNA damage and other processes related to aging and cell senescence in 
age-related diseases. Dietary components, foods, and dietary patterns rich in 
antioxidants can modulate the aging process and delay the progression of some 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and Alzheimer's 
disease. Foods high in polyphenols, vitamin C, or carotenoids, olive oil, seeds, 
nuts, legumes, dietary supplements such as CoQ10, and some other dietary factors 
are the most important nutritional sources that have high antioxidant contents 
which can positively affect cell senescence and disease progression. Plant 
dietary patterns including Mediterranean diets can also inhibit telomere 
shortening following oxidative damages, and this can delay cell aging and 
senescence in age-related diseases. Further, olive oil can inhibit protein 
aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. It can be concluded that nutrition can delay 
the process of cell senescence in age-related diseases via inhibiting oxidative 
and inflammatory pathways. However, more studies are needed to better clarify 
the underlying mechanisms of nutrition and dietary components on cell 
senescence, aging, and disease progression, especially those related to age.

The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is an important agricultural pest 
that severely damages cruciferous vegetables. Although previously considered a 
threat only to Brassica species, P. xylostella has been observed to feed on 
noncruciferous vegetables. Here, we established a population of P. xylostella on 
the pea Pisum sativum (PxP population). We compared this PxP population's 
performance on the pea host plant to a population (PxR) reared on the original 
host plant radish (Raphanus sativus) for several generations using an age-stage, 
two-sex life table and analyzed the correlations between different fitness 
parameters. In the 1st generation of the PxP population, survival rate of 
immature stage was 17%, while the survival rate of PxR was 68%; the duration of 
the 4th larval instar (5.30 d) and mortality (25%) of this generation were 
significantly longer (2.8 d) and higher (1%) than that of PxR, respectively 
(both p < .001). Upon long-term acclimation, the PxP fitness improved 
significantly, especially that the survival rate of immature stages increased to 
approximately 60% in the 15th, 30th, and 45th generations. However, PxP feeding 
on pea exhibited poorer fitness with longer larval developmental time, shorter 
total life span, lighter pupa, and lower fecundity in different generations 
compared with PxP feeding on radish. PxP feeding on pea also showed a 
significantly lower intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproduction rate (R 0), 
finite increase rate (λ), and longer mean generation time (T) than PxP feeding 
on radish in all generations tested. Significant positive correlations were 
observed between pupal weight and female fecundity in pea-fed populations, and 
between female longevity and female fecundity in pea-fed and radish-fed 
populations. Our findings suggest that P. xylostella adaptation to pea does not 
improve overall fitness compared with the original host radish, making pea a 
marginal host for P. xylostella.

PURPOSE: To describe retinal findings in a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis 
type I (MPS I) that underwent an early treatment with hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Case Report. We 
describe a case of a 12-year-old female with a biochemical and genetic diagnosis 
of MPS I. She underwent HSCT and ERT on the first year of life. The visual 
acuity was 5/10 in both eyes and she had bilateral grade 2 corneal haze. 
Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed thickening of the 
external limiting membrane (ELM) at the fovea. In the parafoveal and perifoveal 
regions, SD-OCT displayed a loss of the interdigitation, ellipsoid, and myoid 
zones and of the ELM accompanied by progressive thinning of the outer nuclear 
layer. Fundus infrared imaging revealed a hyperreflective ring centred on the 
fovea and hyporeflective areas in temporal parafoveal regions in both eyes. En 
face OCT imaging revealed two hyperreflective rings on the outer retinal level.
CONCLUSION: This patient developed macular changes with foveal deposition of 
hyperreflective material and parafoveal thinning, despite early systemic 
treatment. Systemic therapies can provide an increase in life expectancy and 
stabilize visual acuity and corneal clouding, although their effect on retinal 
degeneration is unknown.

BACKGROUND: The spine is the most common location of metastatic diseases. 
Treating a metastatic spinal tumor depends on many factors, including patients' 
overall health and life expectancy. The present study was conducted to 
investigate prognostic factors and clinical outcomes in patients with vertebral 
metastases.
AIM: To investigate prognostic factors and their predictive value in patients 
with metastatic spinal cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 109 patients with metastatic spinal cancer 
was conducted between January 2015 and September 2017. The prognoses and 
survival were analyzed, and the effects of factors such as clinical features, 
treatment methods, primary lesions and affected spinal segments on the prognosis 
of patients with metastatic spinal cancer were discussed. The prognostic value 
of Frankel spinal cord injury functional classification scale, metastatic spinal 
cord compression (MSCC), spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS) and the 
revised Tokuhashi score for prediction of prognosis was explored in patients 
with metastatic spinal tumors.
RESULTS: Age, comorbidity of metastasis from elsewhere, treatment methods, the 
number of spinal tumors, patient's attitude toward tumors and Karnofsky 
performance scale score have an effect on the prognosis of patients (all P < 
0.05). With respect to classification of spinal cord injury, before operation, 
the proportion of grade B and grade C was higher in the group of patients who 
died than in the group of patients who survived, and that of grade D and grade E 
was lower in the group of patients who died than in the group of patients who 
survived (all P < 0.05). At 1 mo after operation, the proportion of grade A, B 
and C was higher in the group of patients who died than in the group of patients 
who survived, and that of grade E was lower in patients in the group of patients 
who died than in the group of patients who survived (all P < 0.05). MSCC 
occurred in four (14.3%) patients in the survival group and 17 (21.0%) patients 
in the death group (P < 0.05). All patients suffered from intractable pain, 
dysfunction in spinal cord and even paralysis. The proportion of SINS score of 1 
to 6 points was lower in the death group than in the survival group, and the 
proportion of SINS score of 7 to 12 points was higher in the death group than in 
the survival group (all P < 0.05). The proportion of revised Tokuhashi score of 
0 to 8 points and 9 to 11 points were higher in the death group than in the 
survival group, and the proportion of revised Tokuhashi score of 12 to 15 points 
was lower in the death group than in the survival group (all P < 0.05). Frankel 
spinal cord injury functional classification scale, MSCC, SINS and revised 
Tokuhashi score were important factors influencing the surgical treatment of 
patients with metastatic spinal cancer (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Frankel spinal cord injury functional classification scale, MSCC,
