INTRODUCTION: There has been wide recognition of the health divide between 
Western Europe and the former socialist countries from Central and Eastern 
Europe. However, these have not been assessed in terms of burden of disease, and 
the effect of stroke has not been fully elucidated, especially in terms of time 
trends.
METHODS: The West-Eastern European stroke burden was analysed using data from 
the Global Burden of Stroke (GBD) Study 2019 in terms of disability-adjusted 
life years lost (DALYs) and years of life lost (YLL) over the period 1990-2019 
by gender. Data were extracted on a regional (West, Central, and East Europe) 
and country level for the twenty former socialist countries from Central and 
East Europe according to GBD regional definitions. We focused on the trends of 
age-standardized stroke DALY rates across the three decades and compared them 
with the average rates for West Europe.
MAIN FINDINGS: All Central and East European countries experienced a decline in 
all-cause disease burden between 1990 and 2019, and a gap was confirmed between 
the East, the Central, and the West European region for men but not for women. 
The age-standardized stroke DALY rates declined in the three European regions 
and in all twenty Central and East European countries but at a different pace. 
The stroke DALY rates among women exhibited the greatest decline in the West 
-59% (95% UI [-60; -57]) followed by the Central European region -48% (95% UI 
[-53; -42]) and lowest among women in East Europe -37% (95% UI [-43; -29]). The 
decline in men was even higher than among women -61% (95% UI [-63; -60]), while 
in Central Europe it was -43% (95% UI [-50; -37]) and in the East -25% (95% UI 
[-34; -14]), leading to widening of the gap between East, Central, and West 
Europe in relation to stroke burden. YLL represented more than 70% of stroke 
DALYs and more than 90% of DALYs for men in East European countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of stroke contributes to the European health gap through 
preventable premature stroke deaths. There are some very successful countries in 
stroke burden management from both Central (Slovenia, Czech Republic, and 
Hungary) and East Europe (Estonia), suggesting that closing the health gap 
between East and West is a realistic aim.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare hereditary, debilitating 
disease that is fatal if untreated. Given its low prevalence, collecting 
longitudinal information on large cohorts of patients is challenging. Analysis 
of health insurance databases offers an approach to meet this challenge. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate longitudinal trends in the presentation and 
management of patients with WD identified in the French national health 
insurance database (SNDS).
METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal, observational study identified people 
with WD in the SNDS database through hospitalisation diagnosis codes and 
long-term illness status between 2009 and 2019 inclusive. For each patient, data 
were extracted on hospitalisations, liver transplantation, mortality, 
WD-specific treatments (d-penicillamine, trientine and zinc), disability status 
and sick leave.
RESULTS: 1,928 patients with WD were identified, of whom 1,520 (78.8%) were 
analysed. Prevalence of WD in 2019 was estimated as 2.2 cases per 100,000. Of 
the 670 patients first documented between 2010 and 2019, 76.1% were hospitalised 
at least once for a mean duration of 4.63±10.6 days. 152 patients (10.0%) 
underwent liver transplantation and 205 died (13.5%). The mean age at death was 
57.9 ± 23.1 years. 665 patients (43.8%) received a WD-specific treatment at 
least once. 167 patients (17.1%) received a government disability pension and 
624 (41.1%) benefited from long-term illness status due to WD.
CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, less than half of patients with WD received treatment 
recommended in practice guidelines, which may contribute to a high disease 
burden in terms of hospitalisations, disability and reduced life expectancy. 
Improving treatment rates, building patient awareness of long-term disease 
impact or developing a new paradigm of treatment could make a significant 
contribution to reducing the disease burden.

Crapemyrtle Bark Scale (Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae; CMBS) is an invasive pest 
species that primarily infest crapemyrtles (Lagerstroemia spp.) in the United 
States. Recent reports have revealed the dire threat of CMBS to attack not only 
crapemrytles but also the U.S. native species with expanded host plants such as 
American beautyberry (Callicarpa spp.) and Hypericum kalmianum L. (St. 
Johnswort). A better understanding of plant-insect interaction will provide 
better and environmental-friendly pest management strategies. In this study, we 
constructed the first comprehensive life table for CMBS to characterize its 
biological parameters, including developmental stages, reproductive behavior, 
and fecundity. The indirect effects of three plant nutrient conditions (water, 
0.01MS, and 0.1MS) on CMBS populations were examined using the age-stage, 
two-sex life table. The demographic analyses revealed that the plant nutrient 
conditions had significantly altered CMBS development in terms of the intrinsic 
rate of increase (r), the finite rate of increase (λ), the net reproductive rate 
(R0), and mean generation time (T). Higher r, λ, and R0 were recorded under 
nutrient-deficient conditions (water), while CMBS reared on plants with 
healthier growing conditions (0.1MS) had the most prolonged T. Overall, CMBS 
shows better insect performance when reared on plants under nutrient-deficient 
conditions.

Noida, UP, India.

Brain disorders are a prevalent and rapidly growing problem in the medical field 
as they adversely affect the quality of life of a human. With an increase in 
life expectancy, it has been reported that diseases like Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, stroke and brain tumors, along with neuropsychological disorders, 
are also being reported at an alarmingly high rate. Despite various therapeutic 
methods for treating brain disorders, drug delivery to the brain has been 
challenging because of a very complex Blood Brain Barrier, which precludes most 
drugs from entering the brain in effective concentrations. Nano-carrier-based 
drug delivery systems have been reported widely by researchers to overcome this 
barrier layer. These systems due to their small size, offer numerous advantages; 
however, their short residence time in the body owing to opsonization hinders 
their success in vivo. This review article focuses on the various aspects of 
modifying the surfaces of these nano-carriers with polymers, surfactants, 
protein, antibodies, cell-penetrating peptides, integrin binding peptides and 
glycoproteins such as transferrin & lactoferrin leading to enhanced residence 
time, desirable characteristics such as the ability to cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), increased bioavailability in regions of the brain and targeted 
drug delivery.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the growing evidence on efficacy, little is known 
regarding the efficiency of Vitamin A supplementation to decrease the 
probability of chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants. This study aims to 
determine the cost-utility of Vitamin A to prevent CLD in preterm infants in 
Colombia.
METHODS: A decision tree model was used to estimate the cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of Vitamin A supplementation in preterm 
infants. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness 
of the model. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of 
US$5180.
RESULTS: Vitamin A was associated with lower costs and higher QALYs. The 
expected annual cost per patient with Vitamin A was US$1579 (95% 
CI US$1555-US$1585) and without Vitamin A was US$1913 (95% CI US$1891-US$1934). 
The QALYs per person estimated with Vitamin A was 0.66 (95% CI 0.66-0.67) and 
without Vitamin A was 0.61 (95% CI 0.60-0.61). This position of absolute 
dominance (Vitamin A has lower costs and higher QALYs than without Vitamin A) is 
unnecessary to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
CONCLUSION: Our economic evaluation shows that Vitamin A is cost-effective to 
reduce the incidence rate of CLD in premature infants in Colombia. Our study 
provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical 
practice guidelines.

In an increasingly aged global population, achieving healthy life expectancy 
through natural and safe drug interventions is highly desirable. Here we show 
that total ginsenosides (TGGR), the main active components in the traditional 
Chinese medicine, ginseng, promote longevity across species. In Drosophila, an 
intriguing effect of TGGR on lifespan was the relatively narrow treatment window 
to elicit long-term benefits. TGGR administration during early adulthood, and 
especially during midlife, was sufficient to extend lifespan in both sexes. TGGR 
did not increase lifespan by reducing food intake or reproductive capacity; 
rather, TGGR increased the fertility of male Drosophila. TGGR augmented 
healthspan readouts associated with youth and with healthy aging, such as 
motility, intestinal barrier integrity, and biorhythm homeostasis. TGGR 
treatment also improved some types of stress resistance in both sexes, including 
increased tolerance to starvation and oxidation, and shifting "aged" gene 
expression patterns toward "healthy" patterns seen in the young. Gene 
expression, pharmacological and genetic epistatic analyses demonstrated that 
TGGR effects require normal expression of genes involved in insulin, TOR and 
MAPK signaling. The positive effects of TGGR on both healthspan and lifespan, 
coupled with its mechanism of action via evolutionarily conserved signaling 
pathways, demonstrate it to be a promising anti-aging drug.

Fractures of the patella constitute approximately 1% of all skeletal injuries. 
The vertical pattern represents 12-17% and the open patella fracture represents 
6-30%. We here represent a rare case constituting the presence of these two 
uncommon (vertical type patella fracture with depression of articular surface). 
A 22-year-old male had a close patella fracture after a road traffic accident. 
The fracture was classified as a vertical and comminuted pattern. A back slab 
above the knee was applied and then the patient was prepared for surgery. Open 
reduction and internal fixation of the patella by miniplate and bone graft 
restore the articular surface, which reduces the risk of post-traumatic 
osteoarthritis. At five months postoperatively, the patient had a satisfactory 
joint motion with full extension and 120° of joint flexion and returned to his 
daily life activities without restriction. Additionally, the patient was in good 
health and able to bear full weight. In conclusion, the treatment choice 
requires a thorough knowledge of the case to ensure good stability and avoid 
fracture displacement.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare, autosomal dominant inherited syndrome 
that affects the germline of the VHL gene, a tumor suppressor gene. VHL disease 
is characterized by the multisystemic development of a variety of benign and 
malignant tumors, especially in the central nervous system (CNS). Such tumors 
include retinal and CNS hemangioblastomas, as well as endolymphatic sac tumors. 
The various tumor sites are responsible for the diversity of signs and symptoms 
related to the disease. The mean age at symptom onset is 33 years. Despite 
medical advances, the average life expectancy of patients with VHL disease is 49 
years. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the clinical diagnosis and is essential 
to the follow-up of patients with VHL disease. This pictorial essay describes 
characteristic CNS manifestations of VHL disease-related tumors that all 
radiology residents should be aware of.

tumores justificam a diversidade de sinais e sintomas relacionados à doença, que 
usualmente se manifestam com a idade média de 33 anos. Apesar dos avanços da 
medicina, a expectativa de vida média desses pacientes é de 49 anos. Exames de 
imagem têm papel fundamental no diagnóstico e são essenciais no seguimento dos 
pacientes com doença de VHL. Este ensaio iconográfico descreve as manifestações 
características dos tumores do SNC relacionados à doença de VHL que todos os

Level of Late Initiation of Antenatal Care Visit and Associated Factors Amongst 
Antenatal Care Attendant Mothers in Gedo General Hospital, West Shoa Zone, 
Oromia Region, Ethiopia.

Debelo BT(1), Danusa KT(1).

Author information:

University, Ambo, Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Antenatal care is a care given for pregnant women and is taken as a 
key maternal care service in improving and keeping health of both life outcomes 
for mothers and newborns. Countries with low antenatal care coverage are the 
countries with very high maternal mortality ratios.
OBJECTIVE: Hence, The aim of this study was to determine the level of late 
initiation of antenatal care visit and associated factors amongst antenatal care 
follow up in Antenatal care (ANC) services at Gedo General Hospital, Western 
Oromia Region, Ethiopia, 2021.
METHODOLOGY: A health facility based cross-sectional study design was conducted 
from July 10-30, 2021 using primary data review and face-to-face interviews 
among clients receiving ANC. A total of 347 mothers was selected by simple 
random sampling and were interviewed while they come to antenatal care follow-up 
in Gedo general hospital. Data were entered into Epi-data version 4.6 and then 
changed to SPSS version 23 for the analysis purpose. Those Variables which are P 
< 0.25 in binary logistic regression were selected as a candidate for multiple 
logistic regressions to determine independently associated factors. The adjusted 
odds ratio was employed with 95% CI to illustrate the strength of association 
and P < 0.05 was used to state a statistical significance.
RESULT: Among 330 women, about 58.5% of women came for their first ANC visit 
initiation lately. Being a housewife, having a family size >4, and having a 
distance from the health facility >1 h were higher odds of late first ANC visit 
initiation as compared to vice versa. Besides, women aged 20-24 years had 0.18 
times and 25-29 years had lower odds of late first ANC visit initiation.
CONCLUSION: Majority of women began their first antenatal care initiation 
lately. Therefore, the provision of awareness on the significance of attending 
the first antenatal care early via health extension workers is recommended.

BACKGROUND: socioeconomic inequity in mortality and life expectancy remains 
inconclusive in low- and middle-income countries, and to what extent the 
associations are mediated or modified by lifestyles remains debatable.
METHODS: we included 21,133 adults from China Health and Nutrition Survey 
(1991-2011) and constructed three parameters to reflect participants' overall 
individual- (synthesising income, education and occupation) and area-level 
(urbanisation index) socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyles (counting the 
number of smoking, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet and bodyweight). HRs 
for mortality and life expectancy were estimated by time-dependent Cox model and 
life table method, respectively.
RESULTS: during a median follow-up of 15.2 years, 1,352 deaths were recorded. 
HRs (95% CIs) for mortality comparing low versus high individual- and area-level 
SES were 2.38 (1.75-3.24) and 1.84 (1.51-2.24), respectively, corresponding to 
5.7 (2.7-8.6) and 5.0 (3.6-6.3) life-year lost at age 50. Lifestyles explained 
≤11.5% of socioeconomic disparity in mortality. Higher lifestyle risk scores 
were associated with higher mortality across all socioeconomic groups. HR (95% 
CI) for mortality comparing adults with low individual-level SES and 3-4 
lifestyle risk factors versus those with high SES and 0-1 lifestyle risk factors 
was 7.06 (3.47-14.36), corresponding to 19.1 (2.6-35.7) life-year lost at age 
50.
CONCLUSION: this is the first nationwide cohort study reporting that 
disadvantaged SES was associated with higher mortality and shorter life 
expectancy in China, which was slightly mediated by lifestyles. Risk lifestyles 
were related to higher mortality across all socioeconomic groups, and those with 
risk lifestyles and disadvantaged SES had much higher mortality risks.

OBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery prolongs life expectancy in severely obese 
individuals, but it is uncertain which of the two dominating bariatric 
procedures, sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass, offers the best long-term 
survival.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study of primary 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy compared with gastric bypass for obesity in 
Sweden and Finland between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2020. The risk of 
all-cause mortality was calculated using multivariable Cox regression, providing 
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, 
Charlson comorbidity index, country, and calendar year.
RESULTS: Among 61,503 patients (median age 42 years; 75.4% women), who 
contributed 415,712 person-years at risk (mean 6.8 person-years), 1,571 (2.6%) 
died during follow-up. Compared with patients who underwent gastric bypass (n = 
51,891 [84.4%]), the sleeve gastrectomy group (n = 9,612 [15.6%]) had similar 
all-cause mortality during the entire study period (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.20), 
but decreased all-cause mortality in more recent years (HR 0.72, 95% CI 
0.54-0.97, from 2014 onward). Diabetes interacted statistically significantly 
with the type of bariatric surgery, with higher all-cause mortality after sleeve 
gastrectomy than after gastric bypass (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.24).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival following sleeve gastrectomy seems to compare 
well with gastric bypass and may even be better during recent years. A tailored 
surgical approach in relation to patients' diabetes status may optimize survival 
in patients selected for bariatric surgery (i.e., sleeve gastrectomy for 
patients without diabetes and gastric bypass for patients with diabetes).

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials reported the benefit of empagliflozin when combined 
with standard treatment relative to cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) 
hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced or preserved 
ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). We conducted a cost-utility 
analysis of combination empagliflozin and standard treatment (ST) versus ST 
alone in Thai HF patients with HFrEF or HFpEF.
METHODS: A Markov model was employed to capture lifetime direct medical costs 
and outcomes from a healthcare system perspective. Two cohorts (HFrEF and HFpEF) 
with an average age of 60 years were enrolled. The clinical inputs were the 
results of the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved studies, and a Thai 
database. Costs were gathered from published studies or from a Thai hospital 
database. Utilities were obtained from published studies. All costs and outcomes 
were discounted at a rate of 3% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were estimated, and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In patients with HFrEF, add-on empagliflozin yielded a life-year gain 
of 0.26, and a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of 0.20 at an increased 
total cost of 409.82 USD compared to ST alone [ICER: 69,218 THB/QALY (2064.98 
USD/QALY gained)]. Among HFpEF patients, add-on empagliflozin yielded a 
life-year gain of 0.07, and a QALY gain of 0.05 at an increased total cost of 
622.49 USD compared to ST alone [ICER: 395,826 THB/QALY (11,809 USD/QALY 
gained)].
CONCLUSIONS: At the local Thai threshold of 4773.27 USD/QALY, empagliflozin is a 
cost-effective add-on treatment for patients with HFrEF, but not for patients 
with HFpEF.

IMPORTANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a large decrease in US life expectancy 
in 2020, but whether a similar decrease occurred in 2021 and whether the 
relationship between income and life expectancy intensified during the pandemic 
are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in life expectancy in 2020 and 2021 and the 
relationship between income and life expectancy by race and ethnicity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective ecological analysis of deaths 
in California in 2015 to 2021 to calculate state- and census tract-level life 
expectancy. Tracts were grouped by median household income (MHI), obtained from 
the American Community Survey, and the slope of the life expectancy-income 
gradient was compared by year and by racial and ethnic composition.
EXPOSURES: California in 2015 to 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2020 to 
2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: California experienced 1 988 606 deaths during 2015 to 2021, including 
654 887 in 2020 to 2021. State life expectancy declined from 81.40 years in 2019 
to 79.20 years in 2020 and 78.37 years in 2021. MHI data were available for 7962 
of 8057 census tracts (98.8%; n = 1 899 065 deaths). Mean MHI ranged from 
$21 279 to $232 261 between the lowest and highest percentiles. The slope of the 
relationship between life expectancy and MHI increased significantly, from 0.075 
(95% CI, 0.07-0.08) years per percentile in 2019 to 0.103 (95% CI, 0.098-0.108; 
P < .001) years per percentile in 2020 and 0.107 (95% CI, 0.102-0.112; P < .001) 
years per percentile in 2021. The gap in life expectancy between the richest and 
poorest percentiles increased from 11.52 years in 2019 to 14.67 years in 2020 
and 15.51 years in 2021. Among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian, Black, and White 
populations, life expectancy declined 5.74 years among the Hispanic population, 
3.04 years among the non-Hispanic Asian population, 3.84 years among the 
non-Hispanic Black population, and 1.90 years among the non-Hispanic White 
population between 2019 and 2021. The income-life expectancy gradient in these 
groups increased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (0.038 [95% CI, 
0.030-0.045; P < .001] years per percentile among Hispanic individuals; 0.024 
[95% CI: 0.005-0.044; P = .02] years per percentile among Asian individuals; 
0.015 [95% CI, 0.010-0.020; P < .001] years per percentile among Black 
individuals; and 0.011 [95% CI, 0.007-0.015; P < .001] years per percentile 
among White individuals) and between 2019 and 2021 (0.033 [95% CI, 0.026-0.040; 
P < .001] years per percentile among Hispanic individuals; 0.024 [95% CI, 
0.010-0.038; P = .002] years among Asian individuals; 0.024 [95% CI, 
0.011-0.037; P = .003] years per percentile among Black individuals; and 0.013 
[95% CI, 0.008-0.018; P < .001] years per percentile among White individuals). 
The increase in the gradient was significantly greater among Hispanic vs White 
populations in 2020 and 2021 (P < .001 in both years) and among Black vs White 
populations in 2021 (P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This retrospective analysis of census tract-level 
income and mortality data in California from 2015 to 2021 demonstrated a 
decrease in life expectancy in both 2020 and 2021 and an increase in the life 
expectancy gap by income level relative to the prepandemic period that 
disproportionately affected some racial and ethnic minority populations. 
Inferences at the individual level are limited by the ecological nature of the 
study, and the generalizability of the findings outside of California are 
unknown.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) experience a 10-25-year 
reduced life expectancy when compared to the general population that is due, in 
part, to poor health behaviors. Yet, in spite of the development of health 
promotion and self-management interventions designed for people with SMI to 
promote health behavior change, the mortality gap has increased, suggesting that 
relevant factors are not being addressed. The objective of the present study was 
to explore potential contributors to early mortality among individuals with SMI 
by drawing from the lived experience of certified peer support specialists and 
service users (SUs).
METHOD: Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted with a convenience 
sample of SU participants (n = 17) and certified peer specialists (n = 15). 
Qualitative data were analyzed using a grounded-theory approach.
RESULTS: We identified a final set of 27 codes relating to five overarching 
themes that relate to both risk factors and protective factors for early death: 
social connectedness (24.1% of coded items), treatment (21.3%), coping (21.3%), 
physical health and wellness (18.5%), and resilience and mental health (14.8%).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Findings add to the literature 
supporting the powerful role of social processes in shaping health in people 
with SMI beyond social determinants of health (SDOH; e.g., income, employment) 
and health behavior change. Interventions that reduce loneliness and isolation 
in combination with addressing more conventional SDOH may have the most 
potential to reduce early mortality in people with SMI. (PsycInfo Database

Ever since the historic discovery of the cooperative oxygenation of its multiple 
subunits, hemoglobin (Hb) has been among the most exhaustively studied 
allosteric proteins. However, the lack of structural information on the 
intermediates between oxygenated and deoxygenated forms prevents our detailed 
understanding of the molecular mechanism of its allostery. It has been difficult 
to prepare crystals of intact oxy-deoxy intermediates and to individually 
identify the oxygen saturation for each subunit. However, our recent 
crystallographic studies have demonstrated that giant Hbs from annelids are 
suitable for overcoming these problems and can provide abundant information on 
oxy-deoxy intermediate structures. Here, we report the crystal structures of 
oxy-deoxy intermediates of a 400 kDa Hb (V2Hb) from the annelid Lamellibrachia 
satsuma, following up on a series of previous studies of similar giant Hbs. Four 
intermediate structures had average oxygen saturations of 78%, 69%, 55%, and 
26%, as determined by the occupancy refinement of the bound oxygen based on 
ambient temperature factors. The structures demonstrate that the cooperative 
oxygen dissociation is weaker, large ternary and quaternary changes are induced 
at a later stage of the oxygen dissociation process, and the ternary and 
quaternary changes are smaller with local perturbations. Nonetheless, the 
overall structural transition seemed to proceed in the manner of the MWC 
two-state model. Our crystallographic snapshots of the allosteric transition of 
V2Hb provide important experimental evidence for a more detailed understanding 
of the allostery of Hbs by extension of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model.

BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic cumulative 
United States COVID-19 deaths per capita were higher than all other large, 
high-income nations, but with substantial variation across the country.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to detail the public health response during the pandemic 
in Eagle County, Colorado.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND MEASURES: Observational study using pre-COVID-19 county 
public health metrics. Pandemic actions were recorded from a narrative summary 
of daily phone consultations by a county-wide taskforce and interviews. Outcomes 
obtained from local, state, and nationally reported databases.
METHODS: Eagle County began with a life expectancy of 85.9, low all-cause 
age-adjusted death rates equal for both White and Latinx populations, a high 
household median income, and other prepandemic advantages. It also launched an 
innovative, independent county-wide taskforce lead by experienced mid-level 
managers. The taskforce implemented rapid communication of decision 
consequences, made immediate course corrections without traditional 
organizational approvals or contradictory political pressures.
RESULTS: Eagle County was first in Colorado to obtain Personal Protective 
Equipment and to establish a drive-through testing facility. The COVID-19 case 
fatality rate was 0.34%. The sole intensive care unit never reached maximum 
capacity. By March 2022, Eagle County had administered at least 1 vaccine dose 
to 100% of the population and 83% were fully vaccinated.
CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to directly attribute superior outcomes to 
either the baseline characteristics of Eagle County or its innovative taskforce 
design and deployment. Rather this report highlights the potential impact that 
improving the baseline health status of US citizens and permitting novel 
problem-solving approaches by local public health officials might have for the 
next pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) are an important public health 
problem in China. This study aimed to estimate the fatal burden of LRIs in China 
and trends from 1990 to 2019, thereby making targeted prevention strategies.
METHODS: Annual deaths and mortality were collected from the GBD 2019. Estimated 
annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of age-standardized mortality were calculated 
to quantify the trends of LRI mortality. We also analyzed four aetiologies and 
14 risk factors.
RESULTS: In China, total deaths due to LRIs decreased from 543,901 (95 %UI 
472,378-606,600) in 1990 to 185,264 (95 %UI 160,993-216,219) in 2019. From 
1990-2019, the age-standardized mortality decreased by an average of 5.68 % 
(95 %CI 5.46 %-5.89 %) per year, whereas the reduction among adults older than 
70 years (EAPC=-2.56,95 %CI -2.68 to -2.43) was slower than that among children 
under 5 years (EAPC=-10.11,95 %CI -10.46 to -9.76). Moreover, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae was the first leading aetiology of LRI mortality among all ages. 
Although LRI mortality attributable to child undernutrition decreased rapidly 
from 2000 to 2019, alcohol use (EAPC=-1.06,95 %CI -1.40 to -0.72), smoking 
(EAPC=-3.70,95 %CI -3.89 to -3.51), and ambient particulate matter pollution 
(EAPC=-4.00,95 %CI -4.28 to -3.73) remained serious risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: LRIs remain an important health problem in China particularly in 
children under 5 years and adults older than 70 years. Continuous efforts are 
needed to promote maternal and child health, control smoking and alcohol use, 
and improve ambient air quality. More researches focusing on LRIs are required 
to provide targeted and updated prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVE: There is now an unprecedented amount of evidence to consider when 
revising prostate cancer guidelines. We believe that there is a value in 
publishing summaries of national clinical guidelines in English for others to 
read and comment on.
METHODS: This is part 2 of a summary of the Swedish prostate cancer guidelines 
that were published in June 2022. This part covers recurrence after local 
treatment and management of metastatic and castration resistant disease. Part 1 
covers early detection, diagnostics, staging, patient support and management of 
non-metastatic disease.
RESULTS: The 2022 Swedish guidelines include several new recommendations. Among 
these is a recommendation of a period of observation with repeated PSA tests for 
patients with approximately 10 years' life expectancy who experience a BCR more 
than 2-5 years after radical prostatectomy, to allow for estimating the PSA 
doubling time before deciding whether to give salvage radiotherapy or not. 
Recent results from the PEACE-1 trial led to the recommendation of 
triple-treatment with a GnRH agonist, abiraterone plus prednisolone and 6 cycles 
of docetaxel for patients with high-volume metastatic disease who are fit for 
chemotherapy. The Swedish guidelines differ from the European ones by having 
more restrictive recommendations about genetic testing of and high-dose 
zoledronic acid or denosumab treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer, 
and by recommending considering bicalutamide monotherapy for selected patients 
with low-volume metastatic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2022 Swedish prostate cancer guidelines include several new 
recommendations and some that differ from the European guidelines.

BACKGRUOUND: Diabetes is a leading cause of death that is responsible for 1.6 
million annual deaths worldwide. However, the life expectancy and age at death 
of people with diabetes have been a matter of debate.
METHODS: The National Health Insurance Service claims database, merged with 
death records from the National Statistical Information Service in Korea from 
2006 to 2018, was analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 1,432,567 deaths were collected. The overall age at death 
increased by 0.44 and 0.26 year/year in the diabetes and control populations, 
respectively. The disparity in the mean age at death between the diabetes and 
control populations narrowed from 5.2 years in 2006 to 3.0 years in 2018 
(p<0.001). In a subgroup analysis according to the presence of comorbid 
diseases, the number and proportion of deaths remained steady in the group with 
diabetes only, but steadily increased in the groups with diabetes combined with 
dyslipidemia and/or hypertension. Compared to the control population, the 
increase in the mean death age was higher in the population with diabetes. This 
trend was more prominent in the groups with dyslipidemia and/or hypertension 
than in the diabetes only group. Deaths from vascular disease and diabetes 
decreased, whereas deaths from cancer and pneumonia increased. The decline in 
the proportion of deaths from vascular disease was greater in the diabetes 
groups with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia than in the control population.
CONCLUSION: The age at death in the population with diabetes increased more 
steeply and reached a comparable level to those without diabetes.

We aimed to estimate the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) of stomach cancer at the global, regional, and national 
levels. Stomach cancer resulted in 1.3 million (1.2-1.4 million) incident cases, 
9.5 hundred thousand (8.7-10.4 hundred thousand) deaths, and 22.2 million 
(20.3-24.1 million) DALYs in 2019. The age-standardized incidence rate, death 
rate and DALY rate were 15.6 (14.1-17.2), 11.9 (10.8-12.8), and 268.4 
(245.5-290.6) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Between 1990 and 2019, the 
global age-standardized incidence rate, death rate, and DALY rate decreased by 
- 30.5% (- 36.7 to - 22.9), - 41.9% (- 47.2 to - 36.3), and - 45.6% (- 50.8 to 
- 39.8), respectively. In 2019, most of the global numbers of incidence, death 
and DALYs were higher among males than females. A considerable burden of stomach 
cancer was attributable to smoking and a high-sodium diet. Although the global 
age-standardized incidence and death rates have decreased, continued growth in 
absolute numbers in some regions, especially in East Asia, poses a major global 
public health challenge. To address this, public health responses should be 
tailored to fit each country's unique situation. Primary and secondary 
prevention strategies with increased effectiveness are required to reduce the 
incidence and mortality of stomach cancer, particularly in populations with a 
high disease burden.
