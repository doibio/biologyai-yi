BACKGROUND: Localised immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, involving one type 
of tissue, is rare. Little systematic data exists regarding clinical 
presentations, course or outcomes, or risk of progression to systemic 
amyloidosis. We aimed to report clinical features and outcomes of a large series 
of patients with localised light-chain amyloidosis.
METHODS: We examined data for all patients with localised amyloidosis who were 
diagnosed, assessed, and followed at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) 
between Jan 2, 1980, and Dec 15, 2011, from the NAC database and written 
records. The inclusion criteria was the presence of biopsy sample proven 
localised amyloidosis classified as biopsy proven amyloid deposition confined to 
one site or tissue proven by histology of the tissue examined), without any 
evidence of vital organ involvement, which was defined as cardiac, renal, or 
liver involvement or peripheral or autonomic neuropathy and treatment naive.
FINDINGS: We identified 606 patients with biopsy proven localised amyloidosis 
(likely light-chain type in 98%) from 5050 newly diagnosed patients with all 
types of amyloidosis. Median age was 59·5 years (IQR 50·2-74·5). The most common 
sites included bladder (95; 16%), laryngeal or tonsillar (92; 15%), cutaneous 
(84; 14%), and pulmonary nodular (47; 8%). 121 (20%) had a monoclonal 
immunoglobulin or abnormal circulating free light chains. At median follow-up of 
74·4 months (IQR 37·2-132·0), seven (1%) patients progressed to systemic 
immunoglobin light-chain amyloidosis. 270 (51%) patients had one repeated 
treatment intervention and 112 (21%) had more than one repeated treatment 
interventions (predominantly localised debulking). The estimated 5-year overall 
survival was 90·6% (95% CI 87·7-92·9) and 10-year overall survival was 80·3% 
(75·1-84·1). In patients aged 70 years or older, median overall survival was 
12·1 years (95% CI 10·5-13·7).
INTERPRETATION: Localised immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis has an 
excellent prognosis with no apparent effect on life expectancy. Evolution into 
systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis is very rare.
FUNDING: None.

Non-communicable diseases are now the number one cause of disabilities and loss 
of life expectancy. Among them, chronic respiratory conditions constitute a 
major class. The burden of chronic respiratory diseases is generally increasing 
across the globe, and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
are among the main causes of mortality and morbidity. However, the direct and 
indirect costs of these conditions vary across jurisdictions. This article 
reports on recent estimates of the costs of asthma and COPD, with a focus on 
comparing disease burden across different regions. Overall, there is tremendous 
variation in per capita annual costs of asthma and COPD. However, the 
methodology of the cost-of-illness studies is also vastly different, making it 
difficult to associate differences in reported costs to differences in the true 
burden of asthma and COPD. Suggestions are provided towards improving the 
validity and comparability of future studies.

Umiam, 793 103 Meghalaya India.

Sarcoptic mange infestation in pigs is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis. It 
is the most common mange infestation of pigs. The parasite is distributed 
worldwide. Pig owners are generally concerned about the internal parasitic 
infections and ignored the external parasitic infestations. But the external 
parasitic infestation with S. scabiei var. suis has economic significance as it 
causes morbidity, mortality, decreased fertility and feed conversion ratio in 
pigs. Keeping in view of importance of S. scabies var. suis infestation in pigs, 
this communication discussed about the present and past research works done on 
S. scabies var. suis infestation in pigs, particularly its prevalence, life 
cycle, pathological lesions, clinical symptoms, haematobiochemical changes, 
diagnosis, treatment and control, to have an idea about this infestation at a 
glance. It has been concluded that the research work done on sarcoptic mange 
infestation in pigs in India is less in comparison to other countries. It may be 
due to its consideration as a neglected parasite or due to it's under report. 
Organization of awareness programs for the farmers by extension personalities or 
other authorities might be able to save the farmers from economic losses due to 
this infestation.

BACKGROUND: The most common ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L., is an 
excellent predator of crop pests such as aphids and white flies, and it shows a 
wide range of adaptability, a large appetite and a high reproductive ability. 
Diapause research plays an important role in the artificial propagation and 
shelf-life extension of insect products. Although this lady beetle's regulatory, 
physiological and biochemical characteristics in the diapause period are well 
understood, the molecular mechanism of diapause remains unknown. Therefore, we 
collected female adults in three different states, i.e., non-diapause, diapause 
and diapause termination, for transcriptome sequencing.
RESULTS: After transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform 
with pretreatment, a total of 417.6 million clean reads from nine samples were 
filtered using the program FASTX (version 0.0). Additionally, 106,262 contigs 
were assembled into 82,820 unigenes with an average length of 921 bp and an N50 
of 1,241 bp. All of the unigenes were annotated through BLASTX alignment against 
the Nr or UniProt database, and 37,872 unigenes were matched. We performed 
further analysis of these unigenes using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of 
proteins (COG), Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) databases. Through pairwise comparisons of the non-diapause (ND), 
diapause (D), and diapause-terminated (DT) groups, 3,501 and 1,427 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between D and ND and 
between DT and D, respectively. Moreover, 443 of the DEGs were specifically 
expressed during the diapause period (i.e., DEGs that were expressed at the 
highest or lowest levels during diapause compared with the other stages). GO 
function and KEGG pathway enrichment were performed on all DEGs and showed that 
RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity and fatty acid metabolism were 
significantly affected. Furthermore, eight specific expressed genes were 
selected for validation using qRT-PCR. Among these eight genes, seven genes were 
up-regulated, and one gene was down-regulated; the change trends of the eight 
genes were the same between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq analysis results.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a new method for collecting and identifying diapause 
insects was described. We generated a vast quantity of transcriptome data from 
C. septempunctata L., providing a resource for gene function research. The 
diapause-associated genes that we identified establish a foundation for future 
studies on the molecular mechanisms of diapause.

BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), often referred to as 
functional electrical stimulation (FES), has been used to activate paralyzed 
skeletal muscle in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). The goal of NMES has 
been to reverse some of the dramatic losses in skeletal muscle mass, to 
stimulate functional improvements in people with incomplete paralysis, and to 
produce some of the health benefits associated with exercise.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this brief review is to describe a quantifiable 
resistance training form of NMES developed by Gary A. Dudley.
METHODS: People with motor complete SCI were first tested to confirm that an 
NMES-induced muscle contraction of the quadriceps muscle could be achieved. The 
contraction stimulus consisted of biphasic pulses at 35 Hz performed with 
increasing current up to what was needed to produce full knee extension. Four 
sets of 10 knee extensions were elicited, if possible. Training occurred 
biweekly for 3 to 6 months, with ankle weights being increased up to an added 
weight of 9.1 kg if the 40 repetitions could be performed successfully for 2 
sessions.
RESULTS: Many participants have performed this protocol without adverse events, 
and all participants showed progression in the number of repetitions and/or the 
amount of weight lifted. Large increases in muscle mass occur, averaging 30% to 
40%. Additional physiological adaptations to stimulated muscle have also been 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the affected skeletal muscle after 
SCI responds robustly to progressive resistance training many years after 
injury. Future work with NMES should determine whether gains in lean mass 
translate to improved health, function, and quality of life.

LLG-3 is a ganglioside isolated from the starfish Linchia laevigata. To clarify 
the structure-activity relationship of the glycan of LLG-3 toward rat 
pheochromocytoma PC12 cells in the presence of nerve growth factor, a series of 
mono- to tetrasaccharide glycan derivatives were chemically synthesized and 
evaluated in vitro. The methyl group at C8 of the terminal sialic acid residue 
was crucial for neuritogenic activity, and the terminal trisaccharide moiety was 
the minimum active motif. Furthermore, the trisaccharide also stimulated 
neuritogenesis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells via mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Phosphorylation of extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was rapidly induced by adding 1 or 10 nM of 
the trisaccharide. The ratio of phosphorylated ERK to ERK reached a maximum 5 
min after stimulation, and then decreased gradually. However, the trisaccharide 
did not induce significant Akt phosphorylation. These effects were abolished by 
pretreatment with the MAPK inhibitor U0126, which inhibits enzymes MEK1 and 
MEK2. In addition, U0126 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in response to 
the trisaccharide dose-dependently. Therefore, we concluded that the 
trisaccharide promotes neurite extension in SH-SY5Y cells via MAPK/ERK 
signaling, not Akt signaling.

OBJECTIVE: This study provides estimates of associations of education with life 
expectancy and the percentage of remaining life from age 40 with disability.
METHOD: We used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1999-2011 ( n = 8,763; 
94,246 person-years), measuring five education levels. We estimated 
probabilities of disability and death with multinomial logistic Markov models, 
and used microsimulations beginning at age 40, controlling for gender, 
race/ethnicity, age, and disability.
RESULTS: With college education, African American and White women, and African 
American and White men, respectively, lived 46.6%, 44.0%, 55.2%, and 50.4% more 
years from age 40 than those educated at less than the ninth grade ( p < .001). 
Corresponding percentages of life with disability were lower with high 
education, by 37.9%, 38.9%, 41.0%, and 39.9% ( p < .001). There was little 
evidence of outcome differences between African Americans and Whites within 
education levels.
DISCUSSION: Low education is associated with shorter lives with much more 
disability.

Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy in the skull: a case report.

Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (MNTI) is a rarely occurring neoplasm 
of neural crest origin, appearing in children during the first year of life. 
MNTI is a benign tumor but is nonetheless locally aggressive; it usually 
originates from the maxilla and the mandible. Recognition of the diagnostic 
features of MNTI is important, so that it may be differentiated from benign 
lesions (dermoid or epidermoid cysts, vascular lesions) as well as from 
malignant lesions such as small round cell tumors. We present a case of a 
2-month-old infant who developed right retroauricular swelling with extension 
through the calvarium and into the central nervous system. The tumor was totally 
resected. Aggressive benign or malignant lesions of the calvarium may entail 
dural infiltration and brain involvement, as in our case. Early diagnosis and 
surgery are thus mandatory for benign or malignant tumors of the calvarium.

Dedicated neural systems represent the space surrounding the body, termed 
Peripersonal space (PPS), by integrating visual or auditory stimuli occurring 
near the body with somatosensory information. As a behavioral proxy to PPS, we 
measured participants' reaction time to tactile stimulation while 
task-irrelevant auditory or visual stimuli were presented at different distances 
from their body. In 7 experiments we delineated the critical distance at which 
auditory or visual stimuli boosted tactile processing on the hand, face, and 
trunk as a proxy of the PPS extension. Three main findings were obtained. First, 
the size of PPS varied according to the stimulated body part, being 
progressively bigger for the hand, then face, and largest for the trunk. Second, 
while approaching stimuli always modulated tactile processing in a 
space-dependent manner, receding stimuli did so only for the hand. Finally, the 
extension of PPS around the hand and the face varied according to their relative 
positioning and stimuli congruency, whereas the trunk PPS was constant. These 
results suggest that at least three body-part specific PPS representations 
exist, differing in extension and directional tuning. These distinct PPS 
representations, however, are not fully independent from each other, but 
referenced to the common reference frame of the trunk.

This study presents age-specific and gender-specific patterns and normative 
values for lower-body isokinetic performance in 195 women and 162 men, 18-80 
years of age, using data collected from 1991 to 2004. Peak torque (PT) and 
average power (AP) during knee extension (KE), knee flexion (KF), ankle plantar 
flexion, and dorsiflexion (DF) at 1.05, 3.14, and 5.24 rad · s(-1) were compared 
by decade. Knee extension and KF at all speeds showed a significant main effect 
by age group (G). Men's KEPT and KEAP at 60 and 70 G were significantly 
different than 20, 30, and 40 G at all speeds. Additionally, 50 G differed from 
all other groups. For women, 50, 60, and 70 G KEPT and KEAP at 5.24 rad · s 
(-1)differed significantly from all other age groups. Men's KFPT and KFAP showed 
no differences among 20, 30, and 40 G, whereas 50 G differed from all groups 
except 60 G. For KFPT and KFAP, women 20 and 30 G differed from other age groups 
at all testing speeds. Plantar flexion and DF performance declines were speed 
specific mainly occurring at 3.14 rad · s.(-1) The results reflect declines in 
strength and power beginning during the fifth decade in men, and earlier in 
women. The study also provides normative values, which may be used to evaluate 
neuromuscular performances by gender across decades of life.

CONTEXT: The relative benefits and harms of hormonal treatment (HT) versus no or 
deferred HT in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa) relapse after 
primary curative therapy are controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of HT for nonmetastatic PCa relapse, 
prognostic factors for treatment outcome, timing of treatment, and the most 
effective treatment strategy to provide guidance for clinical practice.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was undertaken 
incorporating Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (search ended March 
2015). Studies were critically appraised for risk of bias. The outcomes included 
overall and cancer-specific survival, metastasis-free survival, symptom-free 
survival, progression to castrate resistance, adverse events, and quality of 
life.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 9687 articles identified, 27 studies were eligible for 
inclusion (2 RCTs, 8 nonrandomised comparative studies, and 17 case series). The 
results suggest that only a subgroup of patients, especially those with 
high-risk disease, may benefit from early HT. The main predictors for 
unfavourable outcomes were shorter PSA doubling time (<6-12 mo) and higher 
Gleason score (>7). Early HT may be warranted for patients with high-risk 
disease. An intermittent HT strategy appears feasible. Most studies had a 
moderate to high risks of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: HT for PCa relapse after primary therapy with curative intent 
should be reserved for patients at highest risk of progression and with a long 
life expectancy. The potential benefits of starting HT should be judiciously 
balanced against the associated harms.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This article summarises the evidence on the benefits and harms 
of hormonal treatment in prostate cancer (PCa) patients in whom the disease has 
recurred following earlier curative treatment. We found that only a select group 
of patients with aggressive PCa and a fast rising prostate-specific antigen may 
benefit from early hormonal treatment (HT), whereas in others HT may be more 
harmful than beneficial.

Men's vulnerability--women's resilience: from widowhood to late-life 
repartnering.

BACKGROUND: The ongoing increase in life expectancy resulting in people living 
longer after the death of a lifelong spouse along with the stresses of widowhood 
is likely to increase the phenomenon of repartnering in old age. The aim of this 
article is to learn about the attributed meanings of late-life repartnering 
among older repartnered widows and widowers dealing with widowhood.
METHODS: The experiences of 27 couples (54 participants), in which both partners 
were widowed, were chosen from two larger studies on late-life repartnering: one 
took a dyadic perspective (interviewing both partners), and the other took an 
intergenerational approach (interviewing both partners and offspring). Criterion 
sampling in both studies used the criteria of widowers who repartnered above age 
65 and widows above age 60, remarried or not, living separately, or under the 
same roof, and who had children and grandchildren from a lifelong marriage that 
had ended with the death of their spouse. All semi-structured interviews were 
recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed based on grounded theory principles 
and dyadic analysis adapted to families.
RESULTS: Present a grounded model indicating gender differences in dealing with 
the death of a lifelong spouse. Men tended to experience vulnerability whereas 
women tended to experience resilience.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings make an innovative contribution by showing the 
reversal of gender inequality in old age, and gender differences between widows' 
and widowers' coping with widowhood, even though both repartnered. They are 
discussed in light of (critical) feminist gerontology including contribution to 
theory development and implications for practice.

Increased life expectancy and the prospect of longevity lead to reflection on 
the importance of spirituality while aging. This article aims to investigate and 
analyze the concepts that older people have of spirituality and how this concept 
affects their quality of life. It is a descriptive, exploratory, 
quantitative-qualitative study, with a sample of 12 participants over the age of 
60. The following tools were used: semi-structured interviews, 
social-demographic questionnaires and WHOQOL (Bref, SRPB and Domain VI). The 
statistical program SPSS 21.0, and Content Analysis, were used in the analysis. 
The average score on the Psychological Health and Social Relationship domains 
was high, and the WHOQOL-SRPB showed high averages in all facets, and positive 
association with the Bref domains. Content analysis showed a relationship 
between Quality of Life and Spirituality. The latter is conceptualized as: 
Support, Relationship with the Sacred, and Transcendence; and is distinguished 
from Religion, which is defined by Religious Affiliation, Cultural Affiliation, 
and Dogmas. The relationship between spirituality and old age takes place 
through the capacity to bear the limitations, difficulties and losses inherent 
to the process; thus, the nature of living a spiritual life was observed to be 
heterogeneous, while all had in common the recognition of its importance and its 
significance for living an old age with Quality of Life.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the indirect economic burden of 
fire-related deaths in Finland in the period 2000-2010.
METHODS: The Human Capital (HC) approach was the main method used to estimate 
productivity losses due to fire-related deaths. Additionally, Potential Years of 
Life Lost (PYLL) due to deaths were reported.
RESULTS: A total of 1090 fire-related deaths occurred in the period 2000-2010 
within a population of some 5.4 million. The majority were male (76% vs 24%), 
with a mean age of 52 (CI: 51.0-53.2) years for males and 57 (CI: 54.6-59.6) for 
females; 24% (CI: 21.1-26.2%) of victims were over the retirement age. Most of 
the victims died of combustion gas poisoning (65%, CI: 61.8-67.6%), followed by 
burns (33%, CI: 30.6-36.3%). Alcohol was often involved and victims were often 
socially disadvantaged, with socioeconomic features significantly deviating from 
those of the general population. Annual PYLL ranged from 2094 (CI: 1861-2326) to 
3299 (CI: 3008-3594), with an annual average PYLL of 2763 (CI: 2675-2851). PYLL 
per death fell in the study period from 34.3 (2000, CI: 31.0-37.7) to 24.6 
(2010, CI: 21.8-27.6). The reduction is attributable to a decreasing fraction of 
young victims and an increase in average ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Total productivity loss in the period 2000-2010 was c.a. EUR 342 
million (CI: 330-354 million), giving an annual average of EUR 31.1 million (CI: 
30.0-32.2 million), with the mean for a victim being EUR 0.315 million (CI: 
0.30-0.33 million). The economic burden of deaths is considerable and this study 
remedies the lack of academic knowledge about the burden of fire-related deaths.

A reference relative time-scale as an alternative to chronological age for 
cohorts with long follow-up.

Hurley MA(1).

PR1 2HE UK.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiologists have debated the appropriate time-scale for cohort 
survival studies; chronological age or time-on-study being two such time-scales. 
Importantly, assessment of risk factors may depend on the choice of time-scale. 
Recently, chronological or attained age has gained support but a case can be 
made for a 'reference relative time-scale' as an alternative which circumvents 
difficulties that arise with this and other scales. The reference relative time 
of an individual participant is the integral of a reference population hazard 
function between time of entry and time of exit of the individual. The objective 
here is to describe the reference relative time-scale, illustrate its use, make 
comparison with attained age by simulation and explain its relationship to 
modern and traditional epidemiologic methods.
RESULTS: A comparison was made between two models; a stratified Cox model with 
age as the time-scale versus an un-stratified Cox model using the reference 
relative time-scale. The illustrative comparison used a UK cohort of cotton 
workers, with differing ages at entry to the study, with accrual over a time 
period and with long follow-up. Additionally, exponential and Weibull models 
were fitted since the reference relative time-scale analysis need not be 
restricted to the Cox model. A simulation study showed that analysis using the 
reference relative time-scale and analysis using chronological age had very 
similar power to detect a significant risk factor and both were equally 
unbiased. Further, the analysis using the reference relative time-scale 
supported fully-parametric survival modelling and allowed percentile predictions 
and mortality curves to be constructed.
CONCLUSIONS: The reference relative time-scale was a viable alternative to 
chronological age, led to simplification of the modelling process and possessed 
the defined features of a good time-scale as defined in reliability theory. The 
reference relative time-scale has several interpretations and provides a 
unifying concept that links contemporary approaches in survival and reliability 
analysis to the traditional epidemiologic methods of Poisson regression and 
standardised mortality ratios. The community of practitioners has not previously 
made this connection.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium autoethanogenum is an acetogenic bacterium capable of 
producing high value commodity chemicals and biofuels from the C1 gases present 
in synthesis gas. This common industrial waste gas can act as the sole energy 
and carbon source for the bacterium that converts the low value gaseous 
components into cellular building blocks and industrially relevant products via 
the action of the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway. Current 
research efforts are focused on the enhancement and extension of product 
formation in this organism via synthetic biology approaches. However, crucial to 
metabolic modelling and directed pathway engineering is a reliable and 
comprehensively annotated genome sequence.
RESULTS: We performed next generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq technology 
on the DSM10061 strain of Clostridium autoethanogenum and observed 243 single 
nucleotide discrepancies when compared to the published finished sequence (NCBI: 
GCA_000484505.1), with 59.1 % present in coding regions. These variations were 
confirmed by Sanger sequencing and subsequent analysis suggested that the 
discrepancies were sequencing errors in the published genome not true single 
nucleotide polymorphisms. This was corroborated by the observation that over 
90 % occurred within homopolymer regions of greater than 4 nucleotides in 
length. It was also observed that many genes containing these sequencing errors 
were annotated in the published closed genome as encoding proteins containing 
frameshift mutations (18 instances) or were annotated despite the coding frame 
containing stop codons, which if genuine, would severely hinder the organism's 
ability to survive. Furthermore, we have completed a comprehensive manual 
curation to reduce errors in the annotation that occur through serial use of 
automated annotation pipelines in related species. As a result, different 
functions were assigned to gene products or previous functional annotations 
rejected because of missing evidence in various occasions.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a revised manually curated full genome sequence for 
Clostridium autoethanogenum DSM10061, which provides reliable information for 
genome-scale models that rely heavily on the accuracy of annotation, and 
represents an important step towards the manipulation and metabolic modelling of 
this industrially relevant acetogen.

Prevalence and determinants of exclusive breastfeeding among adolescent mothers 
from Quito, Ecuador: a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is the optimal way to feed children 
during their first six months of life, having important benefits for them and 
their mothers. However, the proportion of Ecuadorian mothers who continue to 
exclusively breastfeed their infants during the recommended six-month period has 
been reported to remain below the World Health Organization's goal set of 90 %. 
Little is known regarding factors influencing adolescent mothers to decide 
whether to practice EBF or not. Furthermore, there is no data about the EBF 
rates among adolescent mothers in Quito, Ecuador.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study took place from April to November 2013 in 
the largest maternity ward in Quito, Ecuador (Hospital Gineco Obstétrico Isidro 
Ayora). Adolescent mothers parenting an infant between 6 and 24 months of age 
(n = 375) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire about EBF knowledge, 
beliefs and practices. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify 
the independent predictors of EBF.
RESULTS: In our sample, 62.9 % of adolescent mothers raising infants between 6 
to 24 months of age chose EBF. Knowledge about the maternal benefits of 
breastfeeding and awareness of appropriate time frame for EBF were statistically 
associated with increasing the likelihood of choosing EBF. Adolescent mothers 
who were acquainted with the recommended duration of EBF were more likely to 
practice EBF (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.73; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 
1.003, 2.98) as well as those who knew that breastfeeding is a protective factor 
against breast cancer (AOR = 5.40; 95 % CI 1.19, 24.56).
CONCLUSIONS: Although adolescent mothers may be more prone to discontinuing EBF 
before their infants reach six months of age, the prevalence of EBF among 
adolescent mothers interviewed was higher than the rate reported for Ecuadorian 
mothers in other age groups. Our data underscores the importance of emphasizing 
the correct practice of BF and its benefits in breastfeeding education programs 
provided to Ecuadorian mothers, in order to promote the extension of 
breastfeeding duration to the recommended levels.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the single most common form of inherited heart 
disease. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is a recognised 
feature of this condition which arises when blood leaving the outflow tract is 
impeded by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. In an important 
minority of patients, breathlessness, chest pain and syncope may result and 
persist despite the use of medications. In suitable candidates, surgery may 
relieve obstruction and its associated symptoms, and normalise life expectancy. 
Refinements in surgical techniques have marked improvements in the understanding 
of mechanisms underlying LVOTO. In this review, we hope to provide the reader 
with an understanding of how contemporary surgical practice has developed, which 
patients should be considered for surgery, and what results are anticipated. The 
role echocardiography plays in this area is highlighted throughout.

Diabetes mellitus in elderly.

Author information:
(1)Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Bab El Oued Teaching 
Hospital, Algiers, Algeria.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) frequency is a growing problem worldwide, because of long 
life expectancy and life style modifications. In old age (≥60-65 years old), DM 
is becoming an alarming public health problem in developed and even in 
developing countries as for some authors one from two old persons are diabetic 
or prediabetic and for others 8 from 10 old persons have some dysglycemia. DM 
complications and co-morbidities are more frequent in old diabetics compared to 
their young counterparts. The most frequent are cardiovascular diseases due to 
old age and to precocious atherosclerosis specific to DM and the most bothersome 
are visual and cognitive impairments, especially Alzheimer disease and other 
kind of dementia. Alzheimer disease seems to share the same risk factors as DM, 
which means insulin resistance due to lack of physical activity and eating 
disorders. Visual and physical handicaps, depression, and memory troubles are a 
barrier to care for DM treatment. For this, old diabetics are now classified 
into two main categories as fit and independent old people able to take any 
available medication, exactly as their young or middle age counterparts, and 
fragile or frail persons for whom physical activity, healthy diet, and medical 
treatment should be individualized according to the presence or lack of 
cognitive impairment and other co-morbidities. In the last category, the 
fundamental rule is "go slowly and individualize" to avoid interaction with poly 
medicated elder persons and fatal iatrogenic hypoglycemias in those treated with 
sulfonylureas or insulin.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health outcomes such as survival, minimal disability 
and well-being are presumptively dependent on food and ecosystems. An integral 
measure of the critical urban food system linkages to health problems is needed. 
Much of the current health change in cities could be attributed to short-comings 
in food systems which can pose threats to food security and food safety. Health 
problems have needed a reconceptualisation of present medical and nutritional 
constructs.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The present study is based on a situational analysis 
of food and the related ecosystems presumptively affected by rapid urbanisation 
in China. With an ecological information matrix, an Urban Food System Index with 
ten indicators which could influence food system outcomes and promote health and 
well-being has been developed. It uses sixteen data sets from the National 
Bureau of Statistics for all 31 provinces in China. The indicators were 
Locality, Climate, Biodiversity, Infrastructure, Transport, Population 
structure, Livelihood, Recreation and Socialisation, Personal security and 
Communication. The indicators for each province, scored between 1 (severe) and 5 
(best), were used to predict life expectancy for China as a whole by 
multivariable regression analysis.
RESULTS: The best model explained 70% of the variance and had significant beta 
coefficients for population structure (proportion of juveniles) (-0.52, 
p<0.0001) and livelihood (food expenditure) (0.31, p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Population characteristics and livelihoods related to food systems 
can account for much of life expectancy as a health outcome. An index which 
captured this in-formation is provided and could evaluate concurrently as well 
as prospectively food system-related health with urbanisation.

OBJECTIVE: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with myriad 
health conditions and risk behaviors in both adolescents and adults. In this 
study we examine the association between ACEs and specific physical, mental, and 
developmental conditions, as well as their comorbidity, in a nationally 
representative sample of children 0-17 years.
METHODS: Data from the 2011-2012 National Survey for Child Health (NSCH) were 
used. A total of 95,677 random-digit-dial interviews with parents of children 
0-17 years were conducted across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Outcomes included singular condition domains (physical, mental, and 
developmental) as well as combinations of condition domains (e.g., physical plus 
mental, mental plus developmental, etc.).
RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of parents reported that their child experienced 1 
ACE; 9.2 % experienced 2 ACEs, and 10.3 % experienced three or more. Across all

least one ACE were more likely than children who experienced 0 ACEs to have at 
least one condition. Additionally, greater ACEs was associated with increased 
likelihood of at least one condition in each domain and in multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: for practice These findings support the extension of existing 
family environment screening tools in pediatric practices as well as the
