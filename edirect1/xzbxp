BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy of HIV-infected patients has driven 
increased costs due to life-long HIV treatment and concurrent age-related 
comorbidities. This population-based study aimed to investigate the burden of 
chronic diseases and health costs for HIV+ subjects compared to the general 
population living in Brescia Local health Agency (LHA) over a 12-year period.
METHODS: LHA database recorded diagnoses, deaths, drug prescriptions and health 
resource utilization for all residents during 2003-2014. We estimated HIV 
prevalence and incidence, HIV-related mortality as well as prevalence of chronic 
diseases in HIV+ subjects. Observed/expected ratio of chronic diseases was 
calculated by indirect standardization with the general population as reference. 
Direct cost of HIV care and determinants were estimates across the period.
RESULTS: HIV prevalence increased from 220 to 307 per 100 000 person-years while 
incidence decreased from 16.1 to 10.8 per 100 000 person-years from 2003 to 
2014. Prevalence of most comorbidities increased over time but it reduced 
significantly (annual mean change - 0.7 %) when adjusting for age and gender. 
Observed to expected ratio for each chronic disease in HIV+ subjects decreased 
over time. Cost of HIV+ cures increased (+25 %) mainly due to cost for drugs 
(+50 %) but it stabilized in recent years. CD4+ cell count at the time of 
diagnosis was an important predictor of cost for HIV management.
CONCLUSIONS: Expenditures for HIV-infection are driven mainly by drugs cost and 
they have increased overtime. However, our findings suggest that spending on 
public health for HIV care can improve prognosis of HIV-infected patients, 
reduce transmission of HIV infection and reduce the global burden of chronic 
diseases, leading to a reduction of HIV global cost in the medium-long time.

BACKGROUND: Providing end of life care in rural areas is challenging. We 
evaluated in a pilot whether nurse practitioner (NP)-led care, including 
clinical care plans negotiated with involved health professionals including the 
general practitioner(GP), ± patient and/or carer, through a single 
multidisciplinary case conference (SMCC), could influence patient and health 
system outcomes.
METHODS: Setting - Australian rural district 50 kilometers from the nearest 
specialist palliative care service.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults nearing the end of life from any cause, life expectancy 
several months. Intervention- NP led assessment, then SMCC as soon as possible 
after referral. A clinical care plan recorded management plans for current and 
anticipated problems and who was responsible for each action. Eligible patients 
had baseline, 1 and 3 month patient-reported assessment of function, quality of 
life, depression and carer stress, and a clinical record audit. Interviews with 
key service providers assessed the utility and feasibility of the service.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were referred to the service, forty from the 
specialist service. Many patients required immediate treatment, prior to both 
the planned baseline assessment and the planned SMCC (therefore ineligible for 
enrollment). Only six patients were assessed per protocol, so we amended the 
protocol. There were 23 case conferences. Reasons for not conducting the case 
conference included the patient approaching death, or assessed as not having 
immediate problems. Pain (25 %) and depression (23 %) were the most common 
symptoms discussed in the case conferences. Ten new advance care plans were 
initiated, with most patients already having one. The NP or RN made 101 
follow-up visits, 169 phone calls, and made 17 referrals to other health 
professionals. The NP prescribed 24 new medications and altered the dose in 
nine. There were 14 hospitalisations in the time frame of the project. 
Participants were satisfied with the service, but the service cost exceeded 
income from national health insurance alone.
CONCLUSIONS: NP-coordinated, GP supported care resulted in prompt initiation of 
treatment, good follow up, and a care plan where all professionals had named 
responsibilities. NP coordinated palliative care appears to enable more 
integrated care and may be effective in reducing hospitalisations.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity is recommended for people with peripheral arterial 
disease (PAD), and can improve walking capacity and quality of life; and reduce 
pain, requirement for surgery and cardiovascular events. This trial will assess 
the efficacy of a brief behavioral counselling intervention delivered by allied 
health professionals to improve physical activity in people with PAD.
METHODS: This is a multi-center randomised controlled trial in four cities 
across Australia. Participants (N = 200) will be recruited from specialist 
vascular clinics, general practitioners and research databases and randomised to 
either the control or intervention group. Both groups will receive usual medical 
care, a written PAD management information sheet including advice to walk, and 
four individualised contacts from a protocol-trained allied health professional 
over 3 months (weeks 1, 2, 6, 12). The control group will receive four 15-min 
telephone calls with general discussion about PAD symptoms and health and 
wellbeing. The intervention group will receive behavioral counselling via two 
1-h face-to-face sessions and two 15-min telephone calls. The counselling is 
based on the 5A framework and will promote interval walking for 3 × 40 min/week. 
Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and 4, 12 and 24 months by staff 
blinded to participant allocation. Objectively assessed outcomes include 
physical activity (primary), sedentary behavior, lower limb body function, 
walking capacity, cardiorespiratory fitness, event-based claudication index, 
vascular interventions, clinical events, cardiovascular function, circulating 
markers, and anthropometric measures. Self-reported outcomes include physical 
activity and sedentary behavior, walking ability, pain severity, and 
health-related quality of life. Data will be analysed using an 
intention-to-treat approach. An economic evaluation will assess whether 
embedding the intervention into routine care would likely be value for money. A 
cost-effectiveness analysis will estimate change in cost per change in activity 
indicators due to the intervention, and a cost-utility analysis will assess 
change in cost per quality-adjusted life year. A full uncertainty analysis will 
be undertaken, including a value of information analysis, to evaluate the 
economic case for further research.
DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a 
brief behavioral counselling intervention for a common cardiovascular disease 
with significant burden.

BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in veterinary 
practice. However, contrary to human medicine, epilepsy classification in 
veterinary medicine had not been clearly defined until recently. A number of 
reports on canine epilepsy have been published, reflecting in part updated 
proposals from the human epilepsy organization, the International League Against 
Epilepsy. In 2015, the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force (IVETF) 
published a consensus report on the classification and definition of canine 
epilepsy. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the 
etiological distribution, survival time of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (IdE) 
and structural epilepsy (StE), and risk factors for survival time, according to 
the recently published IVETF classification. We investigated canine cases with 
epilepsy that were referred to our teaching hospital in Japan during the past 
10 years, and which encompassed a different breed population from Western 
countries.
RESULTS: A total of 358 dogs with epilepsy satisfied our etiological study 
criteria. Of these, 172 dogs (48 %) were classified as IdE and 76 dogs (21 %) as 
StE. Of these dogs, 100 dogs (consisting of 65 with IdE and 35 with StE) were 
included in our survival study. Median survival time from the initial epileptic 
seizure in dogs with IdE and StE was 10.4 and 4.5 years, respectively. Median 
lifespan of dogs with IdE and StE was 13.5 and 10.9 years, respectively. 
Multivariable analysis demonstrated that risk factors for survival time in IdE 
were high seizure frequency (≥0.3 seizures/month) and focal epileptic seizures.
CONCLUSIONS: Focal epileptic seizures were identified as a risk factor for 
survival time in IdE. Clinicians should carefully differentiate seizure type as 
it is difficult to identify focal epileptic seizures. With good seizure control, 
dogs with IdE can survive for nearly the same lifespan as the general dog 
population. Our results using the IVETF classification are similar to previous 
studies, although some features were noted in our Japanese canine population 
(which was composed of mainly small-breed dogs), including a longer lifespan in 
dogs with epilepsy and a larger percentage of meningoencephalomyelitis of 
unknown origin in dogs with StE.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rheumatic inflammatory chronic autoimmune 
disease inducing hypercoagulable state associated with vascular thrombosis and 
pregnancy loss in women. Cardiac, cerebral and vascular strokes in these 
patients are responsible for reduction in life expectancy. Timely diagnosis and 
accurate monitoring of disease are decisive to improve the accuracy of therapy. 
In the present work, we present a NMR-based metabolomic study of blood sera of 
APS patients. Our data show that individuals suffering APS have a characteristic 
metabolomic profile with abnormalities associated to the metabolism of methyl 
group donors, ketone bodies and amino acids. We have identified for the first 
time the metabolomic fingerprint characterizing APS disease having potential 
application to improve APS timely diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic 
approaches.

INTRODUCTION Shifts in diabetes onset to earlier ages, globally and in Cuba, 
signify greater risk of early complications and premature death, with consequent 
economic and social repercussions for families and health systems. OBJECTIVE 
Describe the trend in diabetes burden in Cuban children and adolescents in the 
period 1990 to 2010, in terms of disability-adjusted life years. METHODS A 
descriptive epidemiological study was conducted of diabetes burden in Cuba, 
analyzing the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 for the age group 0-19 
years. Disability-adjusted life years were obtained from the sum of potential 
years of life lost plus years lived with disability. The first is calculated 
based on total deaths in the country in which diabetes was recorded as 
underlying cause; the second from the product of severity, as assigned to 
diabetes in similar studies, and incidence and average duration, provided by the 
DISMOD II program, which estimates six internally consistent epidemiological 
indicators. RESULTS Mortality indicators improved, with a decrease in the rate 
of potential years of life lost in boys from 21.9/100,000 population in 1990 to 
0 in 2010, and in girls from 38.8/100,000 in 1990 to 4.9/100,000 in 2010 (1% of 
disability-adjusted life years in girls in 2010, corresponding to one death). In 
contrast, years lived with disability increased by 134.5% in boys and 156.4% in 
girls. The net result was that disability-adjusted life years increased by >100% 
in both sexes (from 137.2 to 321.9/100,000 in boys and from 157.3 to 
403.3/100,000 in girls, increases of 102.3% and 108.1%, respectively). 
CONCLUSIONS Disability-adjusted life years lost for diabetes in Cuban children 
and adolescents have increased, due to disability, while mortality has 
decreased. KEYWORDS Diabetes mellitus, childhood, adolescence, 
disability-adjusted life years, potential years of life lost, years lived with

Spinal cord injury disrupts the communication between the brain and the spinal 
circuits that orchestrate movement. To bypass the lesion, brain-computer 
interfaces have directly linked cortical activity to electrical stimulation of 
muscles, and have thus restored grasping abilities after hand paralysis. 
Theoretically, this strategy could also restore control over leg muscle activity 
for walking. However, replicating the complex sequence of individual muscle 
activation patterns underlying natural and adaptive locomotor movements poses 
formidable conceptual and technological challenges. Recently, it was shown in 
rats that epidural electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord can 
reproduce the natural activation of synergistic muscle groups producing 
locomotion. Here we interface leg motor cortex activity with epidural electrical 
stimulation protocols to establish a brain-spine interface that alleviated gait 
deficits after a spinal cord injury in non-human primates. Rhesus monkeys 
(Macaca mulatta) were implanted with an intracortical microelectrode array in 
the leg area of the motor cortex and with a spinal cord stimulation system 
composed of a spatially selective epidural implant and a pulse generator with 
real-time triggering capabilities. We designed and implemented wireless control 
systems that linked online neural decoding of extension and flexion motor states 
with stimulation protocols promoting these movements. These systems allowed the 
monkeys to behave freely without any restrictions or constraining tethered 
electronics. After validation of the brain-spine interface in intact (uninjured) 
monkeys, we performed a unilateral corticospinal tract lesion at the thoracic 
level. As early as six days post-injury and without prior training of the 
monkeys, the brain-spine interface restored weight-bearing locomotion of the 
paralysed leg on a treadmill and overground. The implantable components 
integrated in the brain-spine interface have all been approved for 
investigational applications in similar human research, suggesting a practical 
translational pathway for proof-of-concept studies in people with spinal cord 
injury.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate life expectancy over 25 years in HIV-positive people and 
to compare their life expectancy with recent estimates for the general 
population, by education.
METHODS: Patients aged 20 years or older enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study 
1988-2013 were eligible. Patients alive in 2001 were matched to up to 100 Swiss 
residents, by sex, year of birth, and education. Life expectancy at age 20 was 
estimated for monotherapy (1988-1991), dual therapy (1992-1995), early 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART, 1996-1998), later cART (1999-2005) and 
recent cART (2006-2013) eras. Parametric survival regression was used to model 
life expectancy.
RESULTS: In all, 16 532 HIV-positive patients and 927 583 residents were 
included. Life expectancy at age 20 of HIV-positive individuals increased from 
11.8 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.2-12.5] in the monotherapy era to 
54.9 years (95% CI 51.2-59.6) in the most recent cART era. Differences in life 
expectancy across educational levels emerged with cART. In the most recent cART 
period, life expectancy at age 20 years was 52.7 years (95% CI 46.4-60.1) with 
compulsory education, compared to 60.0 years (95% CI 53.4-67.8) with higher 
education. Estimates for the general population were 61.5 and 65.6 years, 
respectively. Male sex, smoking, injection drug use, and low CD4 cell counts at 
enrolment were also independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: In Switzerland, educational inequalities in life expectancy were 
larger among HIV-infected persons than in the general population. Highly 
educated HIV-positive people have an estimated life expectancy similar to Swiss 
residents with compulsory education. Earlier start of cART and effective 
smoking-cessation programs could improve HIV-positive life expectancy further 
and reduce inequalities.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a considerable public 
health challenge. Novel direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens offer high cure 
rates and the promise of reduced HCV incidence and prevalence following the 
up-scaling of treatment. This has focused attention towards affordability. This 
study aimed to estimate the economic value of cure to evaluate the treatment 
costs justifiable from the patient perspective.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A published, validated HCV model was utilized to contrast 
clinical and cost outcomes for patients aged 30-70 years, stratified by METAVIR 
F0-F4, for (i) no treatment and (ii) successful treatment [i.e. sustained 
virologic response (SVR)] ignoring the cost of treatment. Regression equations 
were fitted and used to determine the financial expenditure justifiable to 
achieve a cost-neutral or a cost-effective [£20 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY)] cure. Model inputs were derived from UK literature; costs and 
utilities were discounted at 3.5% over a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: To achieve cost-neutrality, the maximum discounted expenditure 
justifiable for SVR was £3774-43 607 across ages and fibrosis stages. Spending 
between £19 745 (70 years, F0) and £188 420 (30 years, F4) on SVR is expected to 
be cost-effective at £20 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity across HCV patients is considerable, which can obscure 
the relevance of conventional cohort-based economic models evaluated at the 
mean, particularly when considering the value of treatment at the individual 
patient level. By quantifying the full exposition of HCV cost-savings and health 
benefits realizable following HCV cure, this study provides insight into the 
economic value of successful treatment from the patient perspective.

OBJECTIVE: Compared to traditional drugs, specialty drugs tend to be indicated 
for lower prevalence diseases. Our objective was to compare the potential 
population health benefits associated with specialty and traditional drugs in 
the year following product approval.
METHODS: First, we created a dataset of estimates of incremental 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains and incremental life-year (LY) gains for 
US FDA-approved drugs (1999-2011) compared to standard of care at the time of 
approval identified from a literature search. Second, we categorized each drug 
as specialty or traditional. Third, for each drug we identified estimates of US 
disease prevalence for each pertinent indication. Fourth, in order to 
conservatively estimate the potential population health gains associated with 
each new drug in the year following its approval we multiplied the health gain 
estimate by 10% of the identified prevalence. Fifth, we used Mann-Whitney U 
tests to compare the population health gains for specialty and traditional 
drugs.
RESULTS: We identified QALY gain estimates for 101 drugs, including 56 specialty 
drugs, and LY gain estimates for 50 drugs, including 34 specialty drugs. The 
median estimated population QALY gain in the year following approval for 
specialty drugs was 4200 (IQR = 27,000) and for traditional drugs was 694 
(IQR = 24,400) (p = 0.245). The median estimated population LY gain in the year 
following approval for specialty drugs was 7250 (IQR = 39,200) and for 
traditional drugs was 2500 (IQR = 58,200) (p = 0.752).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite often being indicated for diseases of lower prevalence, we 
found a trend towards specialty drugs offering larger potential population 
health gains than traditional drugs, particularly when measured in terms of 
QALYs.

PURPOSE: To investigate second cancer risk (SCR) comparing volumetric modulated 
arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) with different high 
dose fractionation schemes.
METHODS: VMAT and 3DCRT virtual treatment plans for 25 patients previously 
treated with radiotherapy for rectal cancer were evaluated retrospectively. 
Doses prescribed were 25 × 1.8 Gy and 5 × 5 Gy, respectively. SCR was estimated 
using a carcinogenesis model and epidemiological data for carcinoma and sarcoma 
induction. SCR was determined by lifetime attributable risk (LAR).
RESULTS: Mean excess LAR was highest for organs adjacent to the PTV. Total LAR 
for VMAT and 3DCRT was 2.3-3.0 and 2.0-2.7 %, respectively. For 5 × 5 Gy, LAR 
was 1.4-1.9 % for VMAT and 1.2-1.6 % for 3DCRT. Organ-specific excess LAR was 
significantly higher for VMAT, and highest for bladder and colon. Size and shape 
of the PTV influenced SCR and was highest for age ≤ 40 years. For a patient with 
an additional lifetime risk of 60 years, LAR was 10 % for 25 × 1.8 Gy and 6 % 
for 5 × 5 Gy.
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was detected in SCR using 
VMAT or 3DCRT. For bladder and colon, organ-specific excess LAR was 
statistically lower using 3DCRT, however the difference was small. Compared to 
epidemiological data, SCR was smaller when using a hypofractionated schedule. 
SCR was 2 % higher at normal life expectancy.

The majority of strokes occur in women who in crude numbers have poorer outcome 
including higher mortality from stroke than men. This may, however, to a large 
degree be explained by the preponderance of women in the older age groups. 
Nevertheless, incidence of stroke is higher in men than in women. Overall rates 
of stroke decline, but more in men than in women; consequently the excess number 
of strokes in women will be on the rise in the years to come. Risk factors 
differ between men and women: e.g. rates of atrial fibrillation and hypertension 
are higher in women with stroke, while rates of e.g. smoking or high alcohol 
consumption are higher in men, while some risk factors including diabetes or 
smoking carries a higher risk in women than in men. Especially older women are 
less well represented in many trials, which reduces the generalizability of 
results to this from a stroke perspective extremely important population, 
however, in areas of treatment where sufficient data is available, e.g. i.v. 
thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy the benefit is equal between sexes and 
may even be higher in women due to their longer life expectancy. Access to care 
varies between regions depending both on cultural factors and the overall access 
to care; in especially lower income countries though data is very scarce the 
impression is that women's access to care is restricted in comparison to men. 
Specific female risk factors including pregnancy or sex hormone therapy are rare 
causes of stroke especially in high-income countries, however these stroke 
events occur early in life and have massive effect of individual families. 
Evidence on stroke care in these events is extremely limited and more data, also 
including prospective generalizable observational data is urgently needed to 
guide clinicians. Further more specific data on women and stroke is needed to 
identify if gender in some instances should guide treatment and care.

Mutational status of TP53 together with expression of wild-type (wt) IGHV 
represents the most widely accepted biomarkers, establishing a very poor 
prognosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. Adoptive cell 
therapy using allogeneic HLA-mismatched Natural killer (NK) cells has emerged as 
an effective and safe alternative in the treatment of acute myeloid and lymphoid 
leukemias that do not respond to traditional therapies. We have described that 
allogeneic activated NK cells eliminate hematological cancer cell lines with 
multidrug resistance acquired by mutations in the apoptotic machinery. This 
effect depends on the activation protocol, being B-lymphoblastoid cell lines 
(LCLs) the most effective stimulus to activate NK cells. Here, we have further 
analyzed the molecular determinants involved in allogeneic NK cell recognition 
and elimination of B-CLL cells, including the expression of ligands of the main 
NK cell-activating receptors (NKG2D and NCRs) and HLA mismatch. We present 
preliminary data suggesting that B-CLL susceptibility significantly correlates 
with HLA mismatch between NK cell donor and B-CLL patient. Moreover, we show 
that the sensitivity of B-CLL cells to NK cells depends on the prognosis based 
on TP53 and IGHV mutational status. Cells from patients with worse prognosis 
(mutated TP53 and wt IGHV) are the most susceptible to activated NK cells. 
Hence, B-CLL prognosis may predict the efficacy of allogenic activated NK cells, 
and, thus, NK cell transfer represents a good alternative to treat poor 
prognosis B-CLL patients who present a very short life expectancy due to lack of 
effective treatments.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is most prevalent in deprived communities and patients 
with low health literacy have worse glycaemic control and higher rates of 
diabetic complications. However, recruitment from this patient population into 
intervention trials is highly challenging. We conducted a study to explore the 
feasibility of recruitment and to assess the effect of a lay health trainer 
intervention, in patients with low health literacy and poorly controlled 
diabetes from a socioeconomically disadvantaged population, compared with usual 
care. Methods. A pilot RCT comparing the LHT intervention with usual care. 
Patients with HbA1c > 7.5 (58 mmol/mol) were recruited. Baseline and 7-month 
outcome data were entered directly onto a laptop to reduce patient burden. 
Results. 76 patients were recruited; 60.5% had low health literacy and 75% were 
from the most deprived areas of England. Participants in the LHT arm had 
significantly improved mental health (p = 0.049) and illness perception (p = 
0.040). The intervention was associated with lower resource use, better patient 
self-care management, and better QALY profile at 7-month follow-up. Conclusion. 
This study describes successful recruitment strategies for hard-to-reach 
populations. Further research is warranted for this cost-effective, relatively 
low-cost intervention for a population currently suffering a disproportionate 
burden of diabetes, to demonstrate its sustained impact on treatment effects, 
health, and health inequalities.

Geographic disparities in life expectancy are substantial and not fully 
explained by differences in race and socioeconomic status. To develop policies 
that address these inequalities, it is essential to identify other factors that 
account for this variation. In this study we investigated whether population 
well-being-a comprehensive measure of physical, mental, and social health-helps 
explain geographic variation in life expectancy. At the county level, we found 
that for every 1-standard-deviation (4.2-point) increase in the well-being 
score, life expectancy was 1.9 years higher for females and 2.6 years higher for 
males. Life expectancy and well-being remained positively associated, even after 
race, poverty, and education were controlled for. In addition, well-being 
partially mediated the established associations of race, poverty, and education 
with life expectancy. These findings highlight well-being as an important metric 
of a population's health and longevity and as a promising focus for 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Psychosocial distress among patients with limited life expectancy 
influences treatment decisions, treatment adherence, and physical health. 
Veterans may be at elevated risk of psychosocial distress at the end of life, 
and understanding their mental healthcare needs may help identify hospitalized 
patients to whom psychiatric services should be targeted.
OBJECTIVE: To examine mental illness prevalence and mental health treatment 
rates among a national sample of hospitalized veterans with serious physical 
illnesses. Design, Subjects, and Measurements: This was a retrospective study of 
11,286 veterans hospitalized in a Veterans Health Administration acute care 
facility in fiscal year 2011 with diagnoses of advanced cancer, congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or advanced HIV/AIDS. 
Prevalent and incident mental illness diagnoses during and before 
hospitalization and rates of psychotherapy and psychotropic use among patients 
with incident depression and anxiety were measured.
RESULTS: At least one-quarter of the patients in our sample had a mental illness 
or substance use disorder. The most common diagnoses at hospitalization were 
depression (11.4%), followed by alcohol abuse or dependence (5.5%), and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (4.9%). Of the 831 patients with incident 
past-year depression and 258 with incident past-year anxiety, nearly two-thirds 
received at least some psychotherapy or guideline-concordant medication within 
90 days of diagnosis. Of 191 patients with incident depression and 47 with 
incident anxiety at time of hospitalization, fewer than half received mental 
healthcare before discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Many veterans hospitalized with serious physical illnesses have 
comorbid mental illnesses and may benefit from depression and anxiety treatment.

BACKGROUND: Recent data demonstrate decreased fracture risk after operation for 
asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. We performed a revised 
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing parathyroidectomy versus observation while 
incorporating fracture risk reduction.
METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was created comparing parathyroidectomy 
and guideline-based medical observation for a 60-year-old female patient with 
mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. Costs were estimated using 
published Medicare reimbursement data. Treatment strategy outcomes, including 
risk of fracture, were identified by literature review. Quality adjustment 
factors were used to weight treatment outcomes. A threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year was used to determine cost-effectiveness. 
Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were performed to examine the 
effect of uncertainty on the model.
RESULTS: Parathyroidectomy was the dominant strategy (less costly and more 
effective) with an incremental cost savings of $1,721 and an incremental 
effectiveness of 0.185 quality-adjusted life years. Parathyroidectomy remained 
dominant when the relative risk reduction of fracture after operation was ≥14%, 
the cost of fracture was ≥$7,600, or the probability of recurrent laryngeal 
nerve injury was <12.5%. Monte Carlo simulation showed parathyroidectomy was 
cost-effective in 995/1,000 hypothetical patients.
CONCLUSION: When fracture risk reduction is considered, parathyroidectomy for 
mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is the dominant strategy when 
compared to observation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Undernutrition in old age is associated with increased 
morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Treatment by caloric supplementation 
results in weight gain, but compliance is poor in the long run. Few studies 
targeted underlying causes of undernutrition in community-dwelling older adults. 
This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a multifactorial 
personalized intervention focused on eliminating or managing the underlying 
causes of undernutrition to prevent and reduce undernutrition in comparison with 
usual care.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed among 155 
community-dwelling older adults receiving home care with or at risk of 
undernutrition. The intervention included a personalized action plan and 6 
months support. The control group received usual care. Body weight, and 
secondary outcomes were measured in both groups at baseline and 6 months 
follow-up. Multiple imputation, linear regression and generalized estimating 
equation analyses were used to analyze intervention effects. In the 
cost-effectiveness analyses regression models were bootstrapped to estimate 
statistical uncertainty.
RESULTS: This intervention showed no statistically significant effects on body 
weight, mid-upper arm circumference, grip strength, gait speed and 12-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey physical component scale as compared to usual care, but 
there was an effect on the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey mental component 
scale (0-100) (β = 8.940, p=0.001). Borderline significant intervention effects 
were found for both objective and subjective physical function measures, Short 
Physical Performance Battery (0-12) (β = 0.56, p=0.08) and ADL-Barthel score 
(0-20) (β = 0.69, p=0.09). Societal costs in the intervention group were 
statistically non-significantly lower than in the control group (mean 
difference -274; 95% CI -1111; 782). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 
showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.72 at a 
willingness-to-pay of 1000 €/kg weight gain and 0.80 at a willingness-to-pay of 
20,000 €/quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This multifactorial personalized intervention showed a 
statistically non-significant effect and was not cost-effective on body-weight 
compared to usual care. We observed consistently beneficial treatment effects in 
the intervention group on all outcomes measures.
