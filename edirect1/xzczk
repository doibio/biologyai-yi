The objective is to evaluate the relations between gender health inequalities 
and economic prosperity in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries. The groups included health indicators in the 
specification of men, women and gender inequalities: life expectancy, causes of 
mortality and avoidable mortality. The variable determining the economic 
prosperity was represented by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The analytical 
processing included descriptive analysis, analysis of differences and analysis 
of relationships. The regression analysis was presented as the main output of 
the research. Most of the significant gender differences in health showed a more 
positive outcome for women. It is possible to identify a certain relation 
between gender health inequalities and economic prosperity. If there is some 
reduction in gender inequalities in health, the economic prosperity will 
increase. The reduction seems to be more effective on the part of men than 
women. The output of the cluster analysis showed the relations of indicators 
evaluating the inequalities and the prosperity. The countries such as 
Luxembourg, Norway or Switzerland showed very positive outputs, on the other 
hand, the countries with a potential for the improvement are Lithuania, Latvia 
or Estonia. Overall, the policies should focus on reducing the inequalities in 
avoidable mortality as well as reducing the frequent diseases in younger people.

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented as it reached 
all countries in the world within a record short period of time. Even though 
COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old 
or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer 
patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of 
their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are 
limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if 
they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, 
may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, 
special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer 
patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer 
treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care 
providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of 
infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate 
scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social 
services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate 
medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close 
monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing 
and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. 
(5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to 
decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) 
Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral 
medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an 
effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid 
hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For 
selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic 
therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical 
trials.

This study computes educational inequalities in life expectancy (LE), healthy 
life expectancy (HLE), and unhealthy life expectancy (ULE) by gender and 
education level in Spain in 2012. Death registrations and vital status by level 
of education were obtained from Spain's National Institute of Statistics. Health 
prevalences were estimated from the National Health Survey for Spain. We used 
Sullivan's method to compute HLE, ULE, and the proportion of time lived with 
health problems. Our results reveal that Spanish women live longer than men in 
all education groups, but a higher proportion of women report poor health. We 
detect substantial differences in unhealthy life by gender and education, with 
higher effect for women and for those with low levels of education. Poor 
self-perceived health shows the largest educational gradient; chronic diseases 
present the lowest. This is the first work that provides evidence on health 
inequalities by education level in Spain. Our findings seem to be in line with 
reports of the smaller social inequalities experienced in Southern Europe and 
highlight the importance of education level on extending the proportion of years 
spent in good health in a Mediterranean country.

People with schizophrenia have an increased risk of developing cardiometabolic 
diseases and a reduced life expectancy. Studies conducted mainly in Western 
settings report low amounts of activity and poor levels of fitness in this 
population. This study aims to compare physical fitness and activity levels 
between people with schizophrenia/healthy matched controls and investigate 
potential associations between these variables. A cross-sectional study was 
conducted with 57 community-dwelling people with schizophrenia and 57 age-, 
gender- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. Participants completed the 
international physical activity questionnaire and the Young Men's Christian 
Association (YMCA) fitness assessment protocol with accompanying 
cardiovascular/lung function tests. Cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly 
better in healthy matched controls than individuals with schizophrenia in all 
areas (all p < 0.05, d = 0.38 to 1.06). Performance in best trunk flexion, half 
sit-ups and one-minute pulse recovery following the three-min step test were 
significantly worse in the schizophrenia group (all p < 0001, d = 0.76 to 1.04). 
Higher levels of weekly moderate activity (t = -2.66, p = 0.009) and total 
weekly activity levels (t = -2.013, p = 0.047) were reported by the healthy 
controls. Levels of vigorous activity were significantly correlated with some 
areas of lung functioning in the schizophrenia group (all p < 0.05). The 
findings show that Chinese people with schizophrenia have significantly poorer 
fitness than matched healthy controls, demonstrating the need to provide timely 
effective exercise-based interventions as a matter of routine to attenuate the 
risk of developing chronic physical illnesses.

BACKGROUND: The lifetime prevalence of mental disorders in South Korea was 25.4% 
in 2016. The Act on Mental Health enabled the expansion of psychiatric 
facilities; however, resources were allocated without considering the population 
structure or the characteristics of mental health problems.
AIMS: This paper investigates the status and trends of disease burden and the 
government budget for Korean mental health.
METHODS: The burden of mental and behavioral disorders (MBDs) was measured using 
the incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and the mental 
health budget data was from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea.
RESULTS: We estimated that the disease burden of MBDs accounted for 6.4% of the 
total disease burden, ranking as the seventh leading cause of Korean DALYs. The 
mental health budget in South Korea was USD 253.4 million in 2019 (USD 90.3 
million from the general account, USD 65.8 million from the National Health 
Promotion Fund, and USD 97.3 million from the special account for the national 
mental hospitals).
CONCLUSIONS: Challenges are created by the MBD burden on the Korean healthcare 
system, and the budget is insufficient to address this disease burden, 
suggesting that resource allocation systems should be improved.

Studies have shown reduced life expectancy following moderate-severe traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) with death from unintentional poisoning (UP) being 11 times 
higher following TBI than in the general population. The characteristics of 
those who die of unintentional poisoning are compared with the characteristics 
of those who die of other causes (OC) in a retrospective cohort who received 
inpatient rehabilitation following TBI and enrolled in the TBI Model Systems 
National Database between 1989 and 2017 (n = 15,835 cases with 2,238 deaths 
recorded). Seventy-eight cases (3.5%) of deaths were the result of UP, 76% were 
the result of OC, and 20.5% were from an unknown cause. Among the UP deaths, 90% 
involved drugs (of these, 67% involved narcotic drugs and 14% involved 
psychostimulants), and 8% involved alcohol. Age-adjusted risk for UP death was 
associated with: white/non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, living alone, 
non-institutionalization, pre- and post-injury illicit drug use and alcohol/drug 
problem use, any alcohol use at last follow-up, better Functional Independence 
MeasureTM (FIM) scores, history of arrest, moderate disability (vs. severe 
disability or good recovery), less supervision needed, and greater anxiety. 
Adults who receive inpatient rehabilitation for TBI who die from UP are 
distinguishable from those who die of OC. Factors such as pre-injury substance 
use in the context of functional independence may be regarded as targets for 
prevention and/or intervention to reduce substance use and substance-related 
mortality among survivors of moderate-severe TBI. The current findings may have 
implications for medical care, surveillance, prevention, and health promotion.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess long-term arrhythmic risk in patients 
with myocarditis who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
BACKGROUND: The arrhythmic risk of patients with myocarditis overtime remains 
poorly known.
METHODS: The study enrolled 56 patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis who 
received an ICD for either primary (57%) or secondary prevention (43%) according 
to current guidelines. Clinical characteristics, biopsy findings, 
electrophysiological data from endocardial 3-dimensional electroanatomic voltage 
mapping, and device interrogation data were analyzed to detect arrhythmic events 
overtime. Coronary angiography excluded significant coronary artery disease in 
all patients.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 74 ± 60 months (median 65 months), 25 (45%) 
patients had major ventricular arrhythmias treated by ICD intervention (76% 
being terminated by ICD shock and 24% by antitachyarrhythmia burst pacing). At 
multivariable analysis, the presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia on 
admission (hazard ratio: 13.0; 95% confidence interval: 2.0 to 35.0; p = 0.032) 
and the extension of the areas of low potentials at the bipolar endocardial 
mapping (hazard ratio: 1.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.37; p = 0.013) 
were the only independent predictors of appropriate ICD interventions. A cutoff 
value of 10% of abnormal bipolar area at electroanatomical ventricular mapping 
discriminated patients with appropriate ICD interventions with a sensitivity of 
89% and a specificity of 85%.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that the prevalence of life-threatening 
ventricular arrhythmias in patients with myocarditis receiving an ICD according 
to current guidelines is high and the arrhythmic risk persists late overtime. 
Electroanatomical ventricular mapping may be a useful tool to identify patients 
at greater arrhythmic risk.

Cost-effectiveness analysis compares benefits and costs of different 
interventions to inform decision makers. Alternatives are compared based on an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio reported in terms of cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. Multiple cost-effectiveness analyses of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening have been performed. Although regional 
epidemiology of CRC, relevant screening strategies, regional health system, and 
applicable medical costs in local currencies differ by country and region, 
several overarching points emerge from literature on cost-effectiveness of CRC 
screening. Cost-effectiveness analysis informs decisions in ongoing debates, 
including preferred age to begin average-risk CRC screening, and implementation 
of CRC screening tailored to predicted CRC risk.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disease with an 
estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 individuals. In 90% of cases it is caused by 
mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1, the main constituent of extracellular 
microfibrils. Studies on animal models of Marfan syndrome have revealed that 
fibrillin-1 mutations interfere with local TGF-β signaling, in addition to 
impairing tissue integrity. The cardinal features involve the cardiovascular, 
ocular and skeletal systems. The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is made according 
to the revised Ghent nosology. Early identification and appropriate management 
are critical for patients with Marfan syndrome, who are prone to the 
life-threatening cardiovascular complications of aortic aneurysms and aortic 
dissection. The standard treatment includes prophylactic beta-blockers in order 
to slow down dilation of the ascending aorta, and prophylactic aortic surgery. 
The success of current medical and surgical treatment of aortic disease in 
Marfan syndrome has substantially improved mean life expectancy, extending it 
above 72 years. This review aims to provide an overview of this hereditary 
disorder.

BACKGROUND: The clinical effectiveness of surgical versus endovascular therapy 
for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) continues to be debated, and the 
resources required for each therapy are unclear.
METHODS: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
observational studies comparing surgery with endovascular therapy for CLTI, 
which reported clinical effectiveness and resource utilization. Short-term and 
long-term clinical outcomes were examined.
RESULTS: The search yielded 4,231 titles, of which 17 publications met our 
inclusion criteria. Five publications were all from 1 RCT, and 12 publications 
were observational studies. In the RCT, the surgical approach had greater 
resource use in the first year (total hospital days across all admissions for 
surgery versus angioplasty: 46.14 ± 53.87 vs. 36.35 ± 51.39; P < 0.001; also 
true for days in high-dependency and intensive therapy units), but differences 
were not statistically significant in subsequent years. All-cause mortality 
presented a nonsignificant difference favoring angioplasty in the first 2 years 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 
0.75-2.15), but after 2 years, it favored surgical treatment (aHR, 0.34; 95% CI, 
0.17-0.71). The observational studies reported short-term effectiveness and 
resource utilization favoring endovascular therapy, but most differences were 
not statistically significant. Long-term outcomes were more mixed; in 
particular, mortality outcomes generally favored surgery, although concluding 
that cause and effect is not possible as endovascularly treated patients tended 
to be older and may have had a shorter life expectancy regardless of therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical effectiveness and resource utilization of surgery 
compared with endovascular therapy for CLTI is not known with certainty and will 
not be known until ongoing trials report results. It is likely that findings 
will vary by the time horizon, where initial outcomes and utilization tend to 
favor endovascular interventions, but long-term outcomes favor surgical 
revascularization.

Acromegaly is a rare and severe disease caused by an increased and autonomous 
secretion of growth hormone (GH), thus resulting in high circulating levels of 
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Comorbidities and mortality rate are 
closely related to the disease duration. However, in most cases achieving 
biochemical control means reducing or even normalizing mortality and restoring 
normal life expectancy. Current treatment for acromegaly includes neurosurgery, 
radiotherapy and medical therapy. Transsphenoidal surgery often represents the 
recommended first-line treatment. First-generation somatostatin receptor ligands 
(SRLs) are the drug of choice in patients with persistent disease after surgery 
and are suggested as first-line treatment for those ineligible for surgery. 
However, only about half of patients treated with octreotide (or lanreotide) 
achieve biochemical control. Other available drugs approved for clinical use are 
the second-generation SRL pasireotide, the dopamine agonist cabergoline, and the 
GH-receptor antagonist pegvisomant. In the present paper, we revised the current 
literature about the management of acromegaly, aiming to highlight the most 
relevant and recent therapeutic strategies proposed for patients resistant to 
first-line medical therapy. Furthermore, we discussed the potential molecular 
mechanisms involved in the variable response to first-generation SRLs. Due to 
the availability of different medical therapies, the choice for the most 
appropriate drug can be currently based also on the peculiar clinical 
characteristics of each patient.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review is an assessment of the state of the science on 
nutrition disparities and their contribution to disparities in cardiovascular 
health.
RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition disparities remain pervasive by race/ethnicity, 
sex/gender, socioeconomic status, and geography. They are rooted in differences 
in social, cultural, and environmental determinants of health, behavioral and 
lifestyle factors, and the impact of policy interventions. Systematic 
differences in diet quality, dietary patterns, and nutrient intakes contribute 
to cardiovascular disparities and are mediated by microbiota, and CVD risk 
factors including high levels of blood pressure, low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL), and glucose; oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
and endothelial dysfunction. Despite the progress made in nutrition research, 
important gaps persist that signal the need for more effective interventions at 
multiple levels to reduce cardiovascular disparities. Research opportunities 
include (1) exploring the gene-nutrient-environment interactions in the context 
of ancestral diversity; (2) investigating the causal link between diet and gut 
microbiota and impact of social determinants of health; (3) understanding 
resilience; (4) testing the effectiveness of multi-level interventions that 
address social and environmental determinants; and (4) supporting intervention 
research informed by validated implementation science frameworks.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Effective communication is essential to complex 
shared decision making and is associated with improved recovery and pain 
control. However, patients and surgeons often have disparate expectations of 
treatment efficacy and perceptions of cure for advanced malignancies. This study 
measures correlation of patient and surgeon expectations with perceptions of 
cure.
METHODS: Our prospective study surveying surgeon-patient dyads before and after 
surgical consultation was performed for advanced abdominal malignancy between 
July and November 2017 at a single NCI designated cancer center using electronic 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: Patients and surgeons' own opinions regarding surgical candidacy (Q1), 
chance at cure (Q2), and life expectancy (Q3) did not measurably change from 
pre- to postvisit survey as evidenced by unchanged response concordance 
(patients Q1 P = .82; Q2 P = .81; and Q3 P = .53; surgeon responses Q1: P = .17; 
Q2: P = .32; and Q3: P = .50). Patient and surgeon perception of likelihood of 
cure and of estimated life expectancy remained discordant in pre- and postvisit 
surveys (Q2: P = .006 and Q3: P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the stark differences between patient and 
surgeon perceptions of cure and prognosis of gastrointestinal cancers. These 
results prove that a larger scale study using this electronic questionnaire is 
feasible and important to better understand these differences and enhance shared 
decision making.

BACKGROUD: Fabry disease (OMIM #301 500), the most prevalent lysosomal storage 
disease, is caused by enzymatic defects in alpha-galactosidase A (GLA gene; 
Xq22.1). Fabry disease has historically been characterized by progressive renal 
failure, early stroke and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a diminished life 
expectancy. A nonclassical phenotype has been described with an almost exclusive 
cardiac involvement. Specific therapies with enzyme substitution or chaperone 
molecules are now available depending on the mutation carried. Numerous clinical 
and fundamental studies have been conducted without stratifying patients by 
phenotype or severity, despite different prognoses and possible different 
pathophysiologies. We aimed to identify a simple and clinically relevant way to 
classify and stratify patients according to their disease severity.
METHODS: Based on data from the French Fabry Biobank and Registry (FFABRY; n = 
104; 54 males), we applied unsupervised multivariate statistics to determine 
clusters of patients and identify clinical criteria that would allow an 
effective classification of adult patients. Thanks to these criteria and 
empirical clinical considerations we secondly elaborate a new score that allow 
the severity stratification of patients.
RESULTS: We observed that the absence of acroparesthesia or cornea verticillata 
is sufficient to classify males as having the nonclassical phenotype. We did not 
identify criteria that significantly cluster female patients. The classical 
phenotype was associated with a higher risk of severe renal (HR = 35.1; p <10-3) 
and cardiac events (HR = 4.8; p = 0.008) and a trend toward a higher risk of 
severe neurological events (HR = 7.7; p = 0.08) compared to nonclassical males. 
Our simple, rapid and clinically-relevant FFABRY score gave concordant results 
with the validated MSSI.
CONCLUSION: Acroparesthesia and cornea verticillata are simple clinical criteria 
that efficiently stratify Fabry patients, defining 3 different groups: females 
and males with nonclassical and classical phenotypes of significantly different 
severity. The FFABRY score allows severity stratification of Fabry patients.

Early treatment of HIV infection increases life expectancy and reduces 
infectivity; however, delayed HIV diagnosis remains common. Implementation and 
sustainability of hospital-based routine HIV testing in Vancouver, British 
Columbia, was evaluated to address a local HIV epidemic by facilitating earlier 
diagnosis and treatment. Public health issued a recommendation in 2011 to offer 
HIV testing to all patients presenting to three Vancouver hospitals as part of 
routine care, including all patients admitted to medical/surgical units with 
expansion to emergency departments (ED). We evaluated acceptability, 
feasibility, and effectiveness from 2011 to 2014 and continued monitoring 
through 2016 for sustainability. Between October 2011-December 2016, 114,803 HIV 
tests were administered at the three hospitals; an 11-fold increase following 
implementation of routine testing. The rate of testing was sustained and 
remained high through 2018. Of those tested, 151 patients were diagnosed with 
HIV for a testing yield of 0.13%. Review of 12,996 charts demonstrated 4935/5876 
(96·9%) of admitted patients agreed to have an HIV test when offered. People 
diagnosed in hospital were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with acute 
stage (aOR 1·96, 95% CI 1·19, 3·23) infection, particularly those diagnosed in 
the ED. This study provides practice-based evidence of the feasibility, 
acceptability, and effectiveness of implementing a recommendation for routine 
HIV testing among inpatient and emergency department admissions, as well as the 
ability to normalize and sustain this change. Routine hospital-based HIV testing 
can increase diagnoses of acute HIV infection and facilitate earlier initiation 
of antiretroviral treatment.

BACKGROUND: Few models exist that can control for placebo and expectancy effects 
commonly observed in clinical trials measuring 'Cannabis' pharmacodynamics. We 
used the Foramen Rotundum Inflammatory Constriction Trigeminal Infraorbital 
Nerve injury (FRICT-ION) model to measure the effect of "full-spectrum" whole 
plant extracted hemp oil on chronic neuropathic pain sensitivity in mice.
METHODS: Male BALBc mice were submitted to the FRICT-ION chronic neuropathic 
pain model with oral insertion through an incision in the buccal/cheek crease of 
3 mm of chromic gut suture (4-0). The suture, wedged along the V2 trigeminal 
nerve branch, creates a continuous irritation that develops into secondary 
mechanical hypersensitivity on the snout. Von Frey filament stimuli on the mouse 
whisker pad was used to assess the mechanical pain threshold from 0-6 h 
following dosing among animals (n = 6) exposed to 5 μL of whole plant extracted 
hemp oil combined with a peanut butter vehicle (0.138 mg/kg), the vehicle alone 
(n = 3) 7 weeks post-surgery, or a naïve control condition (n = 3).
RESULTS: Mechanical allodynia was alleviated within 1 h (d = 2.50, p < 0.001) 
with a peak reversal effect at 4 h (d = 7.21, p < 0.001) and remained 
significant throughout the 6 h observation window. There was no threshold change 
on contralateral whisker pad after hemp oil administration, demonstrating the 
localization of anesthetic response to affected areas.
CONCLUSION: Future research should focus on how whole plant extracted hemp oil 
affects multi-sensory and cognitive-attentional systems that process pain.

BACKGROUND: In rural settings where patients face significant structural 
barriers to accessing healthcare services, the formal existence of 
government-provided health coverage does not necessarily translate to meaningful 
care delivery. This paper analyses the effectiveness of an innovative approach 
to overcome these barriers, the Right to Health Care programme offered by 
Compañeros en Salud in Chiapas, Mexico. This programme provides comprehensive 
free coverage of all additional direct and indirect medical costs as well as 
accompaniment through the medical system. Over 550 patients had participated 
from 2013 until November 2018.
METHODS: Focusing on ten of the most frequently treated conditions, including 
hernias, cataracts and congenital heart defects, we performed a retrospective 
case study analysis of the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from 
treatment and the cost per QALY for 69 patients. This analysis used disability 
weights and uncertainty intervals from the Global Burden of Disease study and 
organisational micro-costing data for each patient. Each patient was compared to 
their own hypothetical counterfactual health outcome had they not received the 
secondary and tertiary care required for the specific condition. A mixed methods 
approach is used to establish this counterfactual baseline, drawing on 
pre-intervention observations, qualitative interviews and established literature 
precedent.
RESULTS: The programme was found to deliver an average of 14.4 additional QALYs 
(95% uncertainty interval 12.4-15.8) without time discounting. The mean cost per 
QALY over these conditions was $388 USD (95% UI $262-588) at purchasing power 
parity.
CONCLUSIONS: These numbers compare favourably with studies of other health 
services and international cost per QALY guidelines. They reflect the 
on-treatment effect for the ten conditions analysed and are presented as a case 
study indicative of the promise of healthcare intermediaries rather than a 
definitive assessment of cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, these results show the 
potential feasibility and cost effectiveness of a more comprehensive approach to 
healthcare provision in a resource-limited rural setting.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study involves economic analysis of a programme 
facilitating access to public healthcare services. Thus, there was no associated 
clinical trial to be registered.

Elderly people are the main victims of discontinuities in their treatment 
because they require appropriate care. The current system is no longer able to 
satisfactorily cover all these complex and increasingly important demands due to 
the lengthening of life expectancy and the profound crisis affecting health 
professionals. Feedback from the experience of nurses with a Master's degree in 
Advanced Practice in Gerontology since 2012 shows that in this new and critical 
context, they are a serious solution to be adopted by the legislator to meet 
these public health challenges.
