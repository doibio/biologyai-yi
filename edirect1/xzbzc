Engaging in regular physical activity reduces one's risk of chronic disease, 
stroke, cardiovascular disease, and some forms of cancer. These preventive 
benefits associated with physical activity are of particular importance for men, 
who have shorter life expectancy and experience higher rates of chronic diseases 
as compared to women. Studies at the community and national levels have found 
that social and environmental factors are important determinants of men's 
physical activity, but little is known about how regional influences affect 
physical activity behaviors among men. The objective of this study is to examine 
the association between geographic region and physical activity among men in the 
United States, and to determine if there are racial/ethnic differences in 
physical activity within these geographic regions. Cross-sectional data from men 
who participated the 2000 to 2010 National Health Interview Survey ( N = 
327,556) was used. The primary outcome in this study was whether or not men had 
engaged in sufficient physical activity to receive health benefits, defined as 
meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Race/ethnicity and 
geographic region were the primary independent variables. Within every region, 
Hispanic and Asian men had lower odds of engaging in sufficient physical 
activity compared to white men. Within the Northeast, South, and West, black men 
had lower odds of engaging in sufficient physical activity compared to white 
men. The key findings indicate that the odds of engaging in sufficient physical 
activity among men differ significantly between geographic regions and within 
regions by race/ethnicity.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) and genital warts (GW) are a significant public 
health issue in Venezuela. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
the two available vaccines, bivalent and quadrivalent, against Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) in Venezuelan girls in order to inform decision-makers.
METHODS: A previously published Markov cohort model, informed by the best 
available evidence, was adapted to the Venezuelan context to evaluate the 
effects of vaccination on health and healthcare costs from the perspective of 
the healthcare payer in an 11-year-old girls cohort of 264,489. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 5%. Eight scenarios were 
analyzed to depict the cost-effectiveness under alternative vaccine prices, 
exchange rates and dosing schemes. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Compared to screening only, the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines were 
cost-saving in all scenarios, avoiding 2,310 and 2,143 deaths, 4,781 and 4,431 
CCs up to 18,459 GW for the quadrivalent vaccine and gaining 4,486 and 4,395 
discounted QALYs respectively. For both vaccines, the main determinants of 
variations in the incremental costs-effectiveness ratio after running 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were transition 
probabilities, vaccine and cancer-treatment costs and HPV 16 and 18 distribution 
in CC cases. When comparing vaccines, none of them was consistently more 
cost-effective than the other. In sensitivity analyses, for these comparisons, 
the main determinants were GW incidence, the level of cross-protection and, for 
some scenarios, vaccines costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunization with the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines showed 
to be cost-saving or cost-effective in Venezuela, falling below the threshold of 
one Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (104,404 VEF) per QALY gained. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of 
these results.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that body habitus is associated 
with survival (life expectancy) time. We sought to determine if survival 
differed between elite athletes with a range of body types. We hypothesized that 
the survival would differ between athlete types and that ectomorph athletes 
would have longer survival than heavier athletes.
METHODS: For each Olympics between 1928 and 1948 we identified the top (up to 
20) Olympic male and female finishers in the high jump (HJ), discus throw, 
marathon, and 100-m run. We determined date of death using internet searches and 
calculated age-specific expected survival using published US life tables. We 
adjusted life expectancy for country of origin based on Global Burden of Disease 
data.
RESULTS: We identified a death date for 336 of 429 (78%) Olympic athletes 
including 229 males (55 marathon, 56 100-m 58 high jump, 60 discus), and 107 
females (54 100-m, 25 high jump, 28 discus). Discus throwers were heaviest and 
marathon runners the lightest and oldest athletes (p < 0.01). Observed-expected 
survival was highest for high jumpers (7.1 years for women, 3.7 years for men) 
and marathon runners (4.7 years for men) and lowest for sprinters (-1.6 years 
for women and -0.9 years for men). In multivariate analysis controlling for age 
and gender, type of sport remained significantly associated with mortality with 
greatest survival for high jumpers and marathon runners compared to discus 
throwers and sprinters (p = 0.005). Controlling for weight, reduced the survival 
benefit of high jumpers over discus throwers, but had little effect on the 
survival benefit of marathon runners vs. sprinters.
CONCLUSION: Significant differences in long term survival exist for different 
types of track and field Olympic athletes that were explained in part by weight.

High-grade glioma is the most aggressive and severe brain tumor that leads to 
death of almost 50% patients in 1-2 years. Thus, accurate prognosis for glioma 
patients would provide essential guidelines for their treatment planning. 
Conventional survival prediction generally utilizes clinical information and 
limited handcrafted features from magnetic resonance images (MRI), which is 
often time consuming, laborious and subjective. In this paper, we propose using 
deep learning frameworks to automatically extract features from multi-modal 
preoperative brain images (i.e., T1 MRI, fMRI and DTI) of high-grade glioma 
patients. Specifically, we adopt 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and 
also propose a new network architecture for using multi-channel data and 
learning supervised features. Along with the pivotal clinical features, we 
finally train a support vector machine to predict if the patient has a long or 
short overall survival (OS) time. Experimental results demonstrate that our 
methods can achieve an accuracy as high as 89.9% We also find that the learned 
features from fMRI and DTI play more important roles in accurately predicting 
the OS time, which provides valuable insights into functional neuro-oncological 
applications.

"Do grown-ups become happy when they drink?" Alcohol expectancies among 
preschoolers.

Kuntsche E(1).

Despite ample evidence on risky drinking in adolescence and beyond, little is 
known about early alcohol-related precursors. The present study investigates 
whether preschool children are already familiar with the emotional changes that 
are likely to occur when people drink alcohol, that is, their alcohol 
expectancies. Based on the circumplex model of affect (CMA; Russell, 1980), 
expectancies (12 items for alcohol and 12 for soft drinks) were assessed using 
the Berkeley Puppet Interview (BPI; Measelle, Ablow, Cowan, & Cowan, 1998) among 
198 3- to 6-year-olds (52.5% girls) in French-speaking Switzerland who had some 
knowledge of alcoholic beverages. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the 
4-dimensional factor structure (arousal-positive, arousal-negative, 
sedation-positive, sedation-negative) as assumed by the CMA for alcohol 
expectancies but not for soft drink expectancies. For the former, intraclass 
correlation coefficients showed an excellent interrater reliability and a 
satisfactory test-retest reliability. A paired-sample t test revealed that girls 
in particular endorsed positive alcohol expectancies more frequently than 
negative expectancies. There was no significant age difference in any expectancy 
dimension. This study indicates that alcohol expectancies already exist in 
preschoolers and that, even at this early age, expectancies can be classified 
according to the dimensions of valence and activation. This is important because 
alcohol expectancies have been found to be important predictors of early alcohol 
initiation and the development of risky drinking patterns later in life.

BACKGROUND: Decision-analytic cost-effectiveness (CE) models combine many 
parameters, often obtained after meta-analysis.
AIM: We compared different methods of mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) to 
combine transition and event probabilities derived from several trials, 
especially with respect to health-economic (HE) outcomes like (quality adjusted) 
life years and costs.
METHODS: Trials were drawn from a simulated reference population, comparing two 
of four fictitious interventions. The goal was to estimate the CE between two of 
these. The amount of heterogeneity between trials was varied in scenarios. 
Parameter estimates were combined using direct comparison, MTC methods proposed 
by Song and Puhan, and Bayesian generalized linear fixed effects (GLMFE) and 
random effects models (GLMRE). Parameters were entered into a Markov model. 
Parameters and HE outcomes were compared with the reference population using 
coverage, statistical power, bias and mean absolute deviation (MAD) as 
performance indicators. Each analytical step was repeated 1,000 times.
RESULTS: The direct comparison was outperformed by the MTC methods on all 
indicators, Song's method yielded low bias and MAD, but uncertainty was 
overestimated. Puhan's method had low bias and MAD and did not overestimate 
uncertainty. GLMFE generally had the lowest bias and MAD, regardless of the 
amount of heterogeneity, but uncertainty was overestimated. GLMRE showed large 
bias and MAD and overestimated uncertainty. Song's and Puhan's methods lead to 
the least amount of uncertainty, reflected in the shape of the CE acceptability 
curve. GLMFE showed slightly more uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining direct and indirect evidence is superior to using only 
direct evidence. Puhan's method and GLMFE are preferred.

Previous research has shown that anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) 
are expensive illnesses to treat. To reduce their economic burden, adequate 
interventions need to be established. Our objective was to conduct cost-offset 
analyses for evidence-based treatment of eating disorders using outcome data 
from a psychotherapy trial involving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT) for AN and a trial involving CBT for BN. 
Assuming a currently running, ideal healthcare system using a 12-month, 
prevalence-based approach and varying the willingness to participate in 
treatment, we investigated whether the potential financial benefits of AN- and 
BN-related treatment outweigh the therapy costs at the population level. We 
elaborated on a formula that allows calculating cost-benefit relationships 
whereby the calculation of the parameters is based on estimates from data of 
health institutions within the German healthcare system. Additional intangible 
benefits were calculated with the aid of Quality-Adjusted Life Years. The annual 
costs of an untreated eating disorder were 2.38 billion EUR for AN and 617.69 
million EUR for BN. Independent of the willingness to participate in treatment, 
the cost-benefit relationships for the treatment remained constant at 2.51 (CBT) 
and 2.33 (FPT) for AN and 4.05 (CBT) for BN. This consistency implies that for 
each EUR invested in the treatment, between 2.33 and 4.05 EUR could be saved 
each year. Our findings suggest that the implementation of evidence-based 
psychotherapy treatments for AN and BN may achieve substantial cost savings at 
the population level.

OBJECTIVES: An individualized stroke care program was developed to match 
patients' education with their needs regarding stroke knowledge, secondary 
prevention and rehabilitation. Our purpose was to assess feasibility of 
in-hospital and post-discharge, personalized stroke coaching service.
METHODS: Acute ischemic stroke patients enrolled in ASTRAL-B stroke registry 
(Sint-Lucashospital, Bruges Belgium) with: (a) hospitalization between 
12/2014-12/2015, (b) hospital-to-home discharge, and (c) without cognitive 
decline, were selected. The stroke coach contacted patients individually twice 
during hospitalization (2×20min) and post-discharge via phone calls using the 
standardized WSO Post-Strokechecklist. Risk factor management, review of therapy 
and clinical evolution were discussed. Participants were contacted at 2 weeks, 
followed by repeat calls if necessary and ambulatory with the vascular 
neurologist at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Of all 255 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 152 (59.7%) 
received individualized education during hospitalization by the stroke coach. 
Median age of our population was 74 years and median NIHSS 5. Majority of 
patients had at least two cardiovascular risk factors. Patients were not coached 
because of palliative care/decease (10%), unfavorable life expectancy (2%), 
dementia (8.5%) and lack of time due to short hospitalization (22%). A quarter 
of all patients were contacted at least once by phone, 12% were contacted at 
least twice after discharge. At three months, low stroke recurrence (5%) and 
mortality rates (4%) were identified, probably linked to improved adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated feasibility of an individualized coaching service 
executed by well-trained stroke nurse. Future research will focus on developing 
an online portal delivering post-discharge services to patients and caregivers.

BACKGROUND: The evidence on the association between politics and health is 
scarce considering the importance of this topic for population health. Studies 
that investigated the effect of different political regimes on health outcomes 
show inconsistent results.
METHODS: Bayesian time-series cross-section analyses are used to examine the 
overall impact of regional politics on variations in Italian regional life 
expectancy (LE) at birth during the period 1980-2010. Our analyses control for 
trends in and unobserved determinants of regional LE, correct for temporal as 
well as spatial autocorrelation, and employ a flexible specification for the 
timing of the political effects.
RESULTS: In the period from 1980 to 1995, we find no evidence that the 
communist, left-oriented coalitions and Christian Democratic, centre-oriented 
coalitions have had an effect on regional LE. In the period from 1995 onwards, 
after a major reconfiguration of Italy's political regimes and a major 
healthcare reform, we again find no evidence that the Centre-Left and 
Centre-Right coalitions have had a significant impact on regional LE.
CONCLUSION: The presented results provide no support for the notion that 
different regional political regimes in Italy have had a differential effect on 
regional LE, even though Italian regions have had considerable and increasing 
autonomy over healthcare and health-related policies and expenditures.

BACKGROUND: Australia and New Zealand have the highest incidence of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) in the world, presenting considerable health, economic, and 
societal burden. Over a third of the Australian population live in regional 
areas and research has shown they experience a range of health disadvantages 
that result in a higher disease burden and lower life expectancy. The extent to 
which geographical disparities exist in CRC management and outcomes has not been 
systematically explored. The present review aims to identify the nature of 
geographical disparities in CRC survival, clinical management, and psychosocial 
outcomes.
METHODS: The review followed PRISMA guidelines and searches were undertaken 
using seven databases covering articles between 1 January 1990 and 20 April 2016 
in an Australian setting. Inclusion criteria stipulated studies had to be 
peer-reviewed, in English, reporting data from Australia on CRC patients and 
relevant to one of fourteen questions examining geographical variations in a) 
survival outcomes, b) patient and cancer characteristics, c) diagnostic and 
treatment characteristics and d) psychosocial and quality of life outcomes.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight quantitative, two qualitative, and three mixed-methods 
studies met review criteria. Twenty-seven studies were of high quality, sixteen 
studies were of moderate quality, and no studies were found to be low quality. 
Individuals with CRC living in regional, rural, and remote areas of Australia 
showed poorer survival and experienced less optimal clinical management. 
However, this effect is likely moderated by a range of other factors (e.g., SES, 
age, gender) and did appear to vary linearly with increasing distance from 
metropolitan centres. No studies examined differences in use of stoma, or 
support with stomas, by geographic location.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, despite evidence of disparity in CRC survival and clinical 
management across geographic locations, the evidence was limited and at times 
inconsistent. Further, access to treatment and services may not be the main 
driver of disparities, with individual patient characteristics and type of 
region also playing an important role. A better understanding of factors driving 
ongoing and significant geographical disparities in cancer related outcomes is 
required to inform the development of effective interventions to improve the 
health and welfare of regional Australians.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are associated with high costs for productivity 
loss, sickness absence and unemployment. A participatory supportive return to 
work (RTW) program was developed in order to improve RTW among workers without 
an employment contract, sick-listed due to a common mental disorder. The program 
contained a participatory approach, integrated care and direct placement in a 
competitive job. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
and cost-utility of this new program, compared to usual care. In addition, its 
return on investment was evaluated.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 12-month randomized 
controlled trial. A total of 186 participants was randomly allocated to the new 
program (n = 94) or to usual care (n = 92). Effect measures were the duration 
until sustainable RTW in competitive employment and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained. Costs included intervention costs, medical costs and absenteeism 
costs. Registered data of the Dutch Social Security Agency were used to assess 
the duration until sustainable RTW, intervention costs and absenteeism costs. 
QALYs and medical costs were assessed using three- or six-monthly 
questionnaires. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputations. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis were conducted from the 
societal perspective. A return on investment analysis was conducted from the 
social insurer's perspective. Various sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The new program had no significant effect on the duration until 
sustainable RTW and QALYs gained. Intervention costs and medical costs were 
significantly higher in the intervention group. From the societal perspective, 
the maximum probability of cost-effectiveness for duration until sustainable RTW 
was 0.64 at a willingness to pay of about €10 000/day, and 0.27 for QALYs 
gained, regardless of the willingness to pay. From the social insurer's 
perspective, the probability of financial return was 0.18.
CONCLUSIONS: From the societal perspective, the new program was neither 
cost-effective in improving sustainable RTW nor in gaining QALYs. From the 
social insurer's perspective, the program did not result in a positive financial 
return. Therefore, the present study provided no evidence to support its 
implementation.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was listed at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR) under 
NTR3563 on August 7, 2012.

BACKGROUND: ERp is a variable selection and classification method for 
metabolomics data. ERp uses minimized classification error rates, based on data 
from a control and experimental group, to test the null hypothesis of no 
difference between the distributions of variables over the two groups. If the 
associated p-values are significant they indicate discriminatory variables (i.e. 
informative metabolites). The p-values are calculated assuming a common 
continuous strictly increasing cumulative distribution under the null 
hypothesis. This assumption is violated when zero-valued observations can occur 
with positive probability, a characteristic of GC-MS metabolomics data, 
disqualifying ERp in this context. This paper extends ERp to address two sources 
of zero-valued observations: (i) zeros reflecting the complete absence of a 
metabolite from a sample (true zeros); and (ii) zeros reflecting a measurement 
below the detection limit. This is achieved by allowing the null cumulative 
distribution function to take the form of a mixture between a jump at zero and a 
continuous strictly increasing function. The extended ERp approach is referred 
to as XERp.
RESULTS: XERp is no longer non-parametric, but its null distributions depend 
only on one parameter, the true proportion of zeros. Under the null hypothesis 
this parameter can be estimated by the proportion of zeros in the available 
data. XERp is shown to perform well with regard to bias and power. To 
demonstrate the utility of XERp, it is applied to GC-MS data from a metabolomics 
study on tuberculosis meningitis in infants and children. We find that XERp is 
able to provide an informative shortlist of discriminatory variables, while 
attaining satisfactory classification accuracy for new subjects in a 
leave-one-out cross-validation context.
CONCLUSION: XERp takes into account the distributional structure of data with a 
probability mass at zero without requiring any knowledge of the detection limit 
of the metabolomics platform. XERp is able to identify variables that 
discriminate between two groups by simultaneously extracting information from 
the difference in the proportion of zeros and shifts in the distributions of the 
non-zero observations. XERp uses simple rules to classify new subjects and a 
weight pair to adjust for unequal sample sizes or sensitivity and specificity 
requirements.

INTRODUCTION: A diet high in fruits and vegetables (FV) is associated with 
reduced risk of chronic disease. One strategy to incentivize FV consumption 
among low-income households is to make them more affordable through the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This study aims to identify 
the cost effectiveness of subsidizing FV purchases among the one in seven 
Americans who participate in SNAP.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a societal perspective 
to estimate lifetime costs and health gains associated with subsidizing FV 
purchases. A stochastic microsimulation model of obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke in the 2015 U.S. population was used. Model 
parameters were based on nationally representative SNAP participation and 
dietary consumption data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (2003-2012), and data from a randomized trial of FV subsidies among SNAP 
users.
RESULTS: Despite cycling of participants in and out of SNAP, expanding an FV 
subsidy nationwide through SNAP would be expected to reduce incidence of type 2 
diabetes by 1.7% (95% CI=1.2, 2.2), myocardial infarction by 1.4% (95% CI=0.9, 
1.9), stroke by 1.2% (95% CI=0.8, 1.6), and obesity by 0.2% (95% CI=0.1, 0.3), 
and be cost saving from a societal perspective. The saved costs would be largely 
attributable to long-term reductions in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests nationwide SNAP FV subsidies would reduce 
chronic disease morbidity, mortality, and costs over long time horizons that are 
unlikely to be observed in short-term community-based trials.

In this study, the phylogeny and morphology of Mycosphaerella nawae 
(Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota) were examined using Korean and Japanese isolates, 
to establish the phylogenetic relationship between M. nawae and its allied 
species. Korean and Japanese isolates of M. nawae were collected from circular 
leaf spot-diseased leaves and were confirmed based on internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS) sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using multiple 
genes, including the ITS region, 28S rDNA, β-tubulin, translation elongation 
factor-1α, and actin genes. Our results revealed that M. nawae is closely 
related to members of the genus Phaeophleospora but are distant from the 
Ramularia spp. In addition, microscopic analysis revealed pseudothecia on the 
adaxial and abaxial surface of overwintered diseased leaves (ODL) and only on 
the abaxial surface of diseased leaves. Ascospores are oval to fusiform, 
one-septate, tapered at both ends, 1.7~3.1 × 8.1~14.1 µm, and were observed in 
ODL. Conidia are oval, guttulate, one-septate, 3.5~4.9 × 12.8~19.8 µm, and 
barely discernable on 30-day cultures. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report on the phylogeny of M. nawae, which is closely related to the genus 
Phaeophleospora, especially P. scytalidii.

Patients with critical limb ischemia have a poor life expectancy, and aggressive 
revascularization is accepted to maintain their independence in the end stage of 
life. Bypass surgery and, more recently, endovascular interventions with 
angioplasty and stenting have become the treatment of choice to prevent 
amputation and resolve rest pain. Up to 20% of patients with critical limb 
ischemia are not suitable candidates for a vascular intervention because of 
extensive occlusions of the outflow in the crural and pedal vessels. This 
"desert foot" can be treated with a venous arterialization. In this review, we 
discuss the mechanism, the techniques, outcome, and complications of venous 
arterialization.

The nature of unpaid caregiving is changing significantly in response to the 
changing nature of families, increased average life expectancy, and the rise in 
elderly populations. In order to adapt to these challenges, there is an 
increased focus on the workplace as a source of support for caregiver-employees 
(CEs), or employees providing unpaid care to a family member or friend while 
also working in paid employment. As demonstrated by Ireson et al. (2016), a 
number of workplaces in Canada and abroad are currently showing leadership with 
respect to the provision of caregiver-friendly workplace policies (CFWPs). The 
purpose of this study was to explore what is currently being offered to 
caregiver-employees by Canadian and international workplaces, as well as how 
these strategies have been defined, developed, introduced, integrated and 
sustained within the workplace. For the purposes of this study, CEs are defined 
as individuals engaged in paid employment, while simultaneously serving as an 
unpaid elder-care provider. To achieve the aims of this paper, a qualitative 
comparative case study of 21 workplaces was conducted. Participants were 
recruited via strategies such as snowball sampling, cold-calling and social 
media blasts. These workplaces, which operate as exemplars in meeting the needs 
of caregiver-employees, are pivotal to understanding the process which takes 
place in the implementation and success of CFWPs across various 
sectors/industries. The results of this study will be used to inform the wide 
gap in our knowledge about CFWPs while providing the evidence needed to 
workplaces and other organizations to introduce CFWPs into their employment 
practices.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is an important problem in those of advanced age. 
Osteoporosis can induce sacral insufficiency fractures (SIFs). As average life 
expectancy increases, the number of patients with osteoporotic SIFs also 
increases. Osteoporotic SIFs cause severe low back pain and immobilization. 
Treatment of SIFs varies from analgesia to surgery.
OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience and assess the safety and effectiveness 
of minimally invasive percutaneous sacroplasty in patients with osteoporotic 
SIFs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation.
SETTING: The spine and joint specialized hospital's research center.
METHODS: We reviewed cases of percutaneous sacroplasty performed since 2009. We 
used data only from patients with osteoporotic SIFs who were followed for more 
than 12 months after sacroplasty. Tumor-related SIFs were excluded from our 
analysis. The following clinical parameters were investigated: initial 
diagnosis, symptoms, visual analog scale (VAS) of pain, functional mobility 
scale (FDC) score, past history of illness, amount of bone cement infused, and 
complications related to sacroplasty. Also, the following radiological 
parameters were analyzed: the pattern of SIFs, T-score cement leakage, and 
concomitant fractures in other sites.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in our study (4 men and 64 women). 
The mean age of the patients was 76.8 ± 6.2 years. All patients had severe 
osteoporosis (mean T score: -3.9 ± 0.5). Percutaneous sacroplasty was performed 
under fluoroscopic guidance. No major complications or procedure-related 
morbidity occurred. FDS and VAS scores significantly improved after sacroplasty, 
and the improvements lasted through the final follow-up period (P < 0.05).
LIMITATIONS: This study is a retrospective analysis without a control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous sacroplasty is an effective minimally invasive 
treatment for osteoporotic SIFs refractory to conservative management. The study 
patients experienced significant relief of pain and increased mobility.Key 
words: Sacrum, sacroplasty, insufficiency fractures, osteoporosis, minimally 
invasive surgery.

Gamma glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) is the rate-limiting enzyme for 
intracellular glutathione (GSH) synthesis. The GSH concentration and GCL 
activity are declining with age in the central nervous system (CNS), and is 
accompanied by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). To study the biological 
effects of low GSH levels, we disrupted its synthesis both at birth by breeding 
a Gclc loxP mouse with a thy1-cre mouse (NEGSKO mouse) and at a later age by 
breeding with a CaMKII-ERT2-Cre (FIGSKO mouse). NEGSKO mice with deficiency of 
the Gclc in their entire CNS neuronal cells develop at 4 weeks: progressive 
motor neuron loss, gait problems, muscle denervation and atrophy, paralysis, and 
have diminished life expectancy. The observed neurodegeneration in Gclc 
deficiency is of more chronic rather than acute nature as demonstrated by Gclc 
targeted single-neuron labeling from the inducible Cre-mediated knockout (SLICK) 
mice. FIGSKO mice with inducible Gclc deficiency in the forebrain at 23 weeks 
after tamoxifen induction demonstrate profound brain atrophy, elevated 
astrogliosis and neurodegeneration, particularly in the hippocampus region. 
FIGSKO mice also develop cognitive abnormalities, i.e. learning impairment and 
nesting behaviors based on passive avoidance, T-Maze, and nesting behavior 
tests. Mechanistic studies show that impaired mitochondrial glutathione 
homeostasis and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction are responsible for 
neuronal cell loss. This was confirmed by mitochondrial electron transporter 
chain activity analysis and transmission electron microscopy that demonstrate 
remarkable impairment of state 3 respiratory activity, impaired complex IV 
function, and mitochondrial swollen morphology in the hippocampus and cerebral 
cortex. These mouse genetic tools of oxidative stress open new insights into 
potential pharmacological control of apoptotic signaling pathways triggered by 
mitochondrial dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES: The 2014-15 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and deadliest 
Ebola outbreak recorded; however, there remains uncertainty over its wider 
health consequences. Our objective was to provide a comprehensive overview of 
the impact of the Ebola outbreak on population health in the three most affected 
countries: Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review.
METHODS: A narrative overview of the peer-reviewed and grey literature related 
to the impact and consequences of the Ebola outbreak was conducted, synthesizing 
the findings of literature retrieved from a structured search of biomedical 
databases, the Web and references of reviewed articles.
RESULTS: The impact of the Ebola outbreak was profound and multifaceted. The 
health system was severely compromised due to overwhelming demand, healthcare 
workers deaths, resource diversion and closure of health facilities. Fear of 
Ebola and healthcare workers led to a breakdown in trust in health systems. 
Access to healthcare was compromised. Substantial reductions in healthcare 
utilization were reported including over 80% reductions in maternal delivery 
care in Ebola-affected areas, 40% national reductions in malaria admissions 
among children <5 years and substantial reductions in vaccination coverage. 
Socio-economic impacts included reduced community cohesion, education loss, 
reduced child protection, widespread job losses and food insecurity. Increased 
morbidity and mortality and reduced expected life expectancy were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the scope and scale of the consequences of 
the Ebola outbreak on population health. Sustained commitment of the 
international community is required to support health system re-building and to 
urgently address unmet population health needs.

BACKGROUND: In 2011, WHO member states signed up to the 25 × 25 initiative, a 
plan to cut mortality due to non-communicable diseases by 25% by 2025. However, 
socioeconomic factors influencing non-communicable diseases have not been 
included in the plan. In this study, we aimed to compare the contribution of 
socioeconomic status to mortality and years-of-life-lost with that of the 
25 × 25 conventional risk factors.
METHODS: We did a multicohort study and meta-analysis with individual-level data 
from 48 independent prospective cohort studies with information about 
socioeconomic status, indexed by occupational position, 25 × 25 risk factors 
(high alcohol intake, physical inactivity, current smoking, hypertension, 
diabetes, and obesity), and mortality, for a total population of 1 751 479 (54% 
women) from seven high-income WHO member countries. We estimated the association 
of socioeconomic status and the 25 × 25 risk factors with all-cause mortality
