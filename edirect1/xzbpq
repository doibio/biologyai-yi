younger patients may be considered controversial.
METHODS: We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify patients between the 
ages of 40 and 65 years who were diagnosed with SRMs from 2004 to 2011. The 
primary outcome was the use of local ablative therapy. Multivariable logistic 
regression analysis was used to identify patient and hospital factors associated 
with ablation therapies in this cohort.
RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 49,441 patients with SRMs, of 
which 2789 (5.6%) were treated with ablative therapies. The proportion of 
patients undergoing ablation gradually rose from 2.2% in 2004 to 6.2% in 2011 (P 
< .001). On multivariable analysis, patients were more likely to receive local 
ablation at academic hospitals (odds ratio [OR]: 1.5; P < .001) compared with 
community hospitals, or primarily insured by Medicaid (OR: 1.4; P < .001) or 
Medicare (OR: 1.3; P < .001) compared with private insurance.
CONCLUSION: The use of local ablative therapies is gradually rising but has so 
far been limited to a small fraction of young patients with SRMs. Patients 
treated at high-volume, academic hospitals or insured with Medicaid or Medicare 
were treated to a greater degree with ablation. These results have important 
implications for the adoption of ablation and the need for long-term 
surveillance.

EGFR and HER2 are found overexpressed and/or activated in many different human 
malignancies (e.g. breast and colon cancer), and a number of drugs specifically 
targeting these two tyrosine kinases have been developed over the years as 
anticancer agents. In the present review, the renal safety profile of presently 
available agents targeting either HER2 or EGFR will be discussed, together with 
the peculiarities related to their clinical use in patients with impaired renal 
function, or even in dialysis. Indeed, even though renal toxicity is not so 
common with these agents, it may nevertheless happen, especially when these 
agents are combined with traditional chemotherapeutic agents. As a whole, kidney 
impairment or dialysis should not be regarded per se as reasons not to 
administer or to stop an active anti-HER or anti-EGFR anticancer treatment, 
especially given the possibility of significantly improving the life expectancy 
of many cancer patients with the use of these agents.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the years of potential life lost, years of potential 
productive life lost and the labor productivity losses attributable to premature 
deaths due to traffic injuries between 2002 and 2012 in Spain.
METHOD: Several statistical sources were combined (Spanish Registry of Deaths, 
Labor Force Survey and Wage Structure Survey) to develop a simulation model 
based on the human capital approach. This model allowed us to estimate the loss 
of labor productivity caused by premature deaths following traffic injuries from 
2002 to 2012. In addition, mortality tables with life expectancy estimates were 
used to compute years of potential life lost and years of potential productive 
life lost.
RESULTS: The estimated loss of labour productivity caused by fatal traffic 
injuries between 2002 and 2012 in Spain amounted to 9,521 million euros 
(baseline year 2012). The aggregate number of years of potential life lost in 
the period amounted to 1,433,103, whereas the years of potential productive life 
lost amounted to 875,729. Throughout the period analyzed, labor productivity 
losses and years of life lost diminished substantially.
CONCLUSIONS: Labor productivity losses due to fatal traffic injuries decreased 
throughout the period analyzed. Nevertheless, the cumulative loss was alarmingly 
high. Estimation of the economic impact of health problems can complement 
conventional indicators of distinct dimensions and be used to support public 
policy making.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of mortality due to motor vehicle traffic 
injuries (MVTI) compared with other causes of death on life expectancy in Mexico 
and Spain during the three-year periods 2000-2002 and 2010-2012 and the weight 
of the different age groups in years of life expectancy lost (YLEL) due to this 
cause.
METHODS: Based on official death and population data, abridged life tables in 
Mexico and Spain were constructed for the three-year periods studied. Temporary 
life expectancy and YLEL for persons aged 15 to 75 years were calculated by 
selected causes (MVTI, diabetes mellitus, malignant neoplasms and ischemic heart 
diseases) and age groups in each three-year period.
RESULTS: In Spain, YLEL decreased in both sexes from all the causes studied, 
especially MVTI; this reduction was greater in the younger ages. In addition, 
temporary life expectancy increased. In Mexico, YLEL due to MVTI increased in 
men, mainly in young people, and remained unchanged among women. Temporary life 
expectancy declined in men but increased slightly among women.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in YLEL due to MVTI in Spain has contributed to 
increased life expectancy. By contrast, the increase in YLEL due to MVTI among 
Mexican men has contributed to the decline in male life expectancy.

Aging is a long-standing problem that people are always interested in. Thus, it 
is critical to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in aging and 
explore the most efficient method to extend life expectancy. To achieve this 
goal, a wide range of systems including cells, rodent models, budding yeast, 
worms and flies have been employed for decades. In recent years, the effect of 
dietary restriction (DR) on lifespan is in the prime focus. Although we have 
confirmed that reduced insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the 
target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling can increase Drosophila lifespan; the 
precise molecular mechanisms and nutritional response landscape of diet-mediated 
aging is ambiguous. Epigenetic events have been considered as the major 
contributors to lifespan extension with response to DR. The role of DNA 
methylation in aging is well acknowledged in mammals and rodents where it has 
been shown to impact aging by regulating the transcription, though the mechanism 
of regulation is not limited to only transcription. In Drosophila, the 
contribution of methylation during DR in aging is definitely less explored. In 
this review, we will update the advances in mechanisms of DR, with a particular 
focus on methylation as an upcoming target for aging studies and discuss 
Drosophila as a powerful model to understand mechanisms of aging with response 
to diet.

The impact of pharmaceutical innovation on premature cancer mortality in 
Switzerland, 1995-2012.

York, USA. frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu.

The premature cancer mortality rate has been declining in Switzerland, but there 
has been considerable variation in the rate of decline across cancer sites 
(e.g., breast or digestive organs). I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical 
innovation had on premature cancer mortality in Switzerland during the period 
1995-2012 by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more 
pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in premature mortality, 
controlling for the number of people diagnosed and mean age at diagnosis. 
Premature cancer mortality before ages 75 and 65 is significantly inversely 
related to the cumulative number of drugs registered 5, 10, and 15 years 
earlier. The number of drugs registered during 1980-1997 explains 63 % of the 
variation across cancer sites in the 1995-2012 log change in the premature 
(before age 75) mortality rate. Controlling for the cumulative number of drugs, 
the cumulative number of chemical subgroups does not have a statistically 
significant effect on premature mortality. This suggests that drugs (chemical 
substances) within the same class (chemical subgroup) are not "therapeutically 
equivalent". Over 17,000 life-years before age 75 were gained in 2012 due to 
drugs registered during 1990-2007. The number of life-years before age 75 gained 
in 2012 from drugs registered during two earlier periods (1985-2002 and 
1980-1997) were more than twice as great. Since mean utilization of new drugs is 
much lower than mean utilization of older drugs, more recent drug registrations 
may have a smaller effect on premature mortality than earlier drug registrations 
even if the average quality of newer drugs is higher. Estimates of the cost per 
life-year gained before ages 75 and 65 in 2012 from drugs registered during 
1990-2007 are $21,228 and $28,673, respectively. These figures are below even 
the lowest estimates from the value-of-life literature of the value of a 
quality-adjusted life-year. The estimates indicate that the cost per life-year 
before age 75 gained from drugs registered during earlier periods (1985-2002 and 
1980-1997) were considerably lower: $5299 and $3218, respectively. The largest 
reductions in premature mortality occur at least a decade after drugs are 
registered, when their utilization increases significantly. This suggests that 
if Switzerland is to obtain substantial additional reductions in premature 
cancer mortality in the future (a decade or more from now) at a modest cost, 
pharmaceutical innovation (registration of new drugs) is needed today.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a tight-control treatment 
strategy using the handscan (TCHS) compared to using only clinical assessments 
(TC) and compared to a general non-tight-control treatment strategy (usual care; 
UC) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Data from 299 early RA patients from the CAMERA trial were used. 
Clinical outcomes were extrapolated to Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and 
costs using a Markov model. Costs and QALYs were compared between the TC and UC 
treatment strategy arm of the CAMERA trial and a simulated tight-control 
treatment strategy using the handscan (TCHS). Incremental Cost-Effectiveness 
Ratios (ICERs) were calculated and several scenario analyses performed. All 
analyses were performed probabilistically to obtain confidence intervals and 
costs-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves.
RESULTS: In TCHS, €4,660 (95% CI -€11,516 to €2,045) was saved and 0.06 (95% CI 
0.01 to 0.11) QALYs were gained when compared to UC, with an ICER of €77,670 
saved per QALY gained. Ninety-one percent (91%) of simulations resulted in less 
costs and more QALYs. TCHS resulted in comparable costs or even limited savings 
€642 (95% CI -€6,903 to €5,601)) and comparable QALYs to TC. In all scenario 
analyses, TCHS and TC were found to be cost effective as compared to UC.
CONCLUSIONS: A tight-control treatment strategy is highly cost-effective 
compared to a non-tight-control approach in early RA. Using the handscan as a 
monitoring device might facilitate implementation of tight-control treatment 
strategy at comparable costs and with comparable effects. This approach should 
be investigated further.

Microcystis colonial size and concentration have detrimental effects on life 
history traits of Daphnia, but their detailed interactions have remained unclear 
so far. Our experiments show that the interaction between Microcystis colonial 
size and concentration on maturation time, life expectancy, net reproductive 
rate and innate capacity of increase in Daphnia similoides was significant. In 
all groups, the survival rate of D. similoides was 100% within 8 days. This 
value then declined quickly in the large-colony groups and in the SH group of 
Microcystis. Colonial M. aeruginosa significantly reduced the maturation time 
and body length at maturity of D. similoides. The number of offspring at first 
reproduction per female in the SH group of Microcystis was significantly higher 
than those in other groups. Net reproductive rate of D. similoides in the SL 
group of Microcystis was significantly higher than those in other groups of 
Microcystis. The innate capacity of increase of D. similoides in small-colony 
Microcystis groups was significantly higher than that in the large-colony 
groups. The results suggested that the effect of smallcolony Microcystis on the 
reproduction of Daphnia was positive under lower concentration, while their 
toxicity was intensitied under higher concentration when small-colony 
Microcystis were by Daphnia as food.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 2016 Jun 21;164(12):850.
    Ann Intern Med. 2016 Jun 21;164(12):850-1.

BACKGROUND: Each year, herpes zoster (HZ) affects 1 million U.S. adults, many of 
whom develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Zoster vaccine is licensed for 
persons aged 50 years or older, but its cost-effectiveness for those aged 50 to 
59 years is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccine versus no 
vaccination.
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Medical literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Adults aged 50 years.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: HZ vaccine.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of HZ and PHN cases prevented and incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For every 1000 persons receiving the vaccine at 
age 50 years, 25 HZ cases and 1 PHN case could be prevented. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for HZ vaccine versus no vaccine was $323 456 
per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In deterministic and scenario sensitivity 
analyses, the only variables that produced an ICER less than $100 000 per QALY 
were vaccine cost (at a value of $80) and the rate at which efficacy wanes. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was $500 754 per QALY (95% CI, 
$93 510 to $1 691 211 per QALY). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 
per QALY, the probability that vaccination would be cost-effective was 3%.
LIMITATION: Long-term effectiveness data for HZ vaccine are lacking for 
50-year-old adults.
CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster vaccine for persons aged 50 years does not seem to 
represent good value according to generally accepted standards. Our findings 
support the decision of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices not to 
recommend the vaccine for adults in this age group.

The tremendous therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized, 
mainly owing to their short in vivo half-life. Although conjugation to 
macromolecules has been a mainstay approach for enhancing protein half-life, the 
steric hindrance of macromolecules often harms the binding of peptides to target 
receptors, compromising the in vivo efficacy. Here we report a new strategy for 
enhancing the in vivo half-life of peptides without compromising their potency. 
Our approach involves endowing peptides with a small molecule that binds 
reversibly to the serum protein transthyretin. Although there are a few 
molecules that bind albumin reversibly, we are unaware of designed small 
molecules that reversibly bind other serum proteins and are used for half-life 
extension in vivo. We show here that our strategy was effective in enhancing the 
half-life of an agonist for GnRH receptor while maintaining its binding 
affinity, which was translated into superior in vivo efficacy.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness, from a health care 
perspective, of adding rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide scheme (FCR 
versus FC) for treatment-naïve and refractory/relapsed Ukrainian patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A decision-analytic Markov cohort model with three 
health states and 1-month cycle time was developed and run within a life time 
horizon. Data from two multinational, prospective, open-label Phase 3 studies 
were used to assess patients' survival. While utilities were generalized from UK 
data, local resource utilization and disease-associated treatment, 
hospitalization, and side effect costs were applied. The alternative scenario 
was performed to assess the impact of lower life expectancy of the general 
population in Ukraine on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
treatment-naïve patients. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. The ICER (in US 
dollars) of treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with FCR versus FC is 
US$8,704 per quality-adjusted life year gained for treatment-naïve patients and 
US$11,056 for refractory/relapsed patients. When survival data were modified to 
the lower life expectancy of the general population in Ukraine, the ICER for 
treatment-naïve patients was higher than US$13,000. This value is higher than 
three times the current gross domestic product per capita in Ukraine. 
Sensitivity analyses have shown a high impact of rituximab costs and a moderate 
impact of differences in utilities on the ICER. Furthermore, probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses have shown that for refractory/relapsed patients the 
probability of FCR being cost-effective is higher than for treatment-naïve 
patients and is close to one if the threshold is higher than US$15,000. State 
coverage of rituximab treatment may be considered a cost-effective treatment for 
the Ukrainian population under conditions of economic stability, 
cost-effectiveness threshold growth, or rituximab price negotiations.

BACKGROUND: About 90 % of patients with intra-thoracic malignancy experience 
breathlessness. Breathing training is helpful, but it is unknown whether 
repeated sessions are needed. The present study aims to test whether three 
sessions are better than one for breathlessness in this population.
METHODS: This is a multi-centre randomised controlled non-blinded parallel arm 
trial. Participants were allocated to three sessions or single (1:2 ratio) using 
central computer-generated block randomisation by an independent Trials Unit and 
stratified for centre. The setting was respiratory, oncology or palliative care 
clinics at eight UK centres. Inclusion criteria were people with intrathoracic 
cancer and refractory breathlessness, expected prognosis ≥3 months, and no prior 
experience of breathing training. The trial intervention was a complex 
breathlessness intervention (breathing training, anxiety management, relaxation, 
pacing, and prioritisation) delivered over three hour-long sessions at weekly 
intervals, or during a single hour-long session. The main primary outcome was 
worst breathlessness over the previous 24 hours ('worst'), by numerical rating 
scale (0 = none; 10 = worst imaginable). Our primary analysis was area under the 
curve (AUC) 'worst' from baseline to 4 weeks. All analyses were by intention to 
treat.
RESULTS: Between April 2011 and October 2013, 156 consenting participants were 
randomised (52 three; 104 single). Overall, the 'worst' score reduced from 6.81 
(SD, 1.89) to 5.84 (2.39). Primary analysis [n = 124 (79 %)], showed no 
between-arm difference in the AUC: three sessions 22.86 (7.12) vs single session 
22.58 (7.10); P value = 0.83); mean difference 0.2, 95 % CIs (-2.31 to 2.97). 
Complete case analysis showed a non-significant reduction in QALYs with three 
sessions (mean difference -0.006, 95 % CIs -0.018 to 0.006). Sensitivity 
analyses found similar results. The probability of the single session being 
cost-effective (threshold value of £20,000 per QALY) was over 80 %.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that three sessions conferred additional 
benefits, including cost-effectiveness, over one. A single session of breathing 
training seems appropriate and minimises patient burden.

We performed a 1-year cluster-randomized field trial to assess the effect of 
standardized management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on lung 
function and quality of life (QOL) measures in patients in China. We used the 
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) treatment 
guidelines and assessed indexes including pulmonary function, QOL, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea 
scale, 6-min walk distance (6-MWD), number of emergency visits, and frequency of 
hospitalization. Of a total of 711 patients with chronic cough and asthma, 132 
were diagnosed as having COPD and 102 participated in this study [intervention 
group (N = 47); control group (N = 55)]. We found that adherence to GOLD 
guidelines had a perceivable impact on 6-MWD, MRC dyspnea scale score, and QOL. 
The average QALY increased by 1.42/person/year in the intervention group, but 
declined by 0.95/person/year in the control group. We conclude that standardized 
management improves disease severity, QOL, and QALY in COPD patients when 
treatment protocols adhere to GOLD guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects approximately 3 
million people in the UK. An 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) course is 
recommended under current guidelines. However, studies show that initial 
benefits diminish over time.
OBJECTIVE: We present here an economic evaluation conducted alongside a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a low-intensity maintenance programme over 
a time horizon of 1 year delivered in UK primary and secondary care settings.
METHODS: Patients with COPD who completed at least 60 % of a standard 8-week PR 
programme were randomised to a 2-h maintenance session at 3, 6 and 9 months 
(n = 73) or treatment as usual (n = 75). Outcomes were change in Chronic 
Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) score, EQ-5D-based QALYs, cost (price year 2014) 
to the UK NHS and social services over the 12 months following initial PR, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: At 12 months, incremental cost to the NHS and social services was 
-£204.04 (95 % CI -£1522 to £1114). Incremental CRQ and QALY gains were -0.007 
(-0.461 to 0.447) and +0.015 (-0.050 to 0.079), respectively. Based on point 
estimates, PR maintenance therefore dominates treatment as usual from the 
perspective of the NHS and social services in terms of cost per QALY gained. 
Whether it is cost effective in terms of CRQ depends on whether the £204 per 
patient could be reinvested elsewhere to a CRQ gain of greater than 0.007. 
However, there is much decision uncertainty: 95 % CIs around increments did not 
exclude zero, and there is a 72.9 % (72.5 %) probability that the ICER is below 
£20,000 (£30,000) per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Future research should explore whether more intensive maintenance 
regimens offer benefit to patients at reasonable cost.

Based on the data of latest three Chinese population censuses (1990-2010), four 
lifespan indicators were calculated: centenarians per one hundred thousand 
inhabitants (CH); longevity index (LI); the percentage of the population aged at 
least 80 years (ultra-octogenarian index, UOI) and life expectancy at birth 
(LEB). The spatio-temporal distributions of data at Chinese county level show 
that high-longevity areas (high values of CH and LI) and low-longevity areas 
(low CH and LI values) both exhibit clear non-uniformity of spatial distribution 
and relative immobility through time. Contrarily, the distribution of UOI and 
LEB shows a decline from the east to the west. The spatial autocorrelation 
analyses indicate less spatial dependency and several discontinuous clusters 
regions of high-CH and LI areas. The factors of temperature, topography and 
wet/dry climate lack of significant influence on CH and LI. It can be inferred 
that, in addition to genetic factor and living custom, some unique and long-term 
environmental effects may be related with high or low values of CH and LI.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of disability among young 
Americans. Reports suggest that life expectancy (i.e., average age at death) 
remains reduced as compared to the general population, but underlying causes of 
death (UCOD) are less well-characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the cause-specific mortality among participants enrolled 
in the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) 
registry and to compare the profile of these causes by age, sex, race and 
disability status at entry into NARCOMS, with U.S. mortality data.
METHODS: The underlying cause of death (UCOD), any mention cause of death and 
proportionate mortality were compared among U.S. NARCOMS participants by age, 
sex, race and disability status.
RESULTS: Of the 32,445 participants to be considered for this study, 2,927 had 
died. Compared to survivors, decedents were older at enrollment and MS 
diagnosis, more likely to be male, and had less education. UCOD differed 
markedly by age group. In both sexes, MS as the UCOD was proportionately lower 
by 20% or more in those aged 25-39 compared to those aged 75 or older. Cancer 
and cardiovascular causes were more frequent as causes of death with increasing 
age, but were less than expected at older ages. The effect of disability on 
mortality was roughly equivalent to the effect of aging on mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Among NARCOMS participants older age at enrollment, male sex and 
greater disability were associated with increased mortality risk. This cohort of 
MS subjects had a lower proportionate mortality from cardiovascular disease and 
cancer compared to the U.S. population.

INTRODUCTION: During the past decade, it has become increasingly more common to 
offer hip arthroscopic surgery when treating people with femoroacetabular 
impingement (FAI). Nevertheless, the latest reviews conclude that it still 
remains to be properly investigated how surgery affects the patients. 
Specifically, detailed information on the functional, muscular and mechanical 
impact of surgery in larger groups is lacking. Furthermore, the long-term 
outcome of the surgery is still to be investigated.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this prospective cohort study, a total of 60 patients 
with FAI scheduled for arthroscopic surgery will be followed and tested 
preoperatively, and again after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Assessment includes 
isokinetic dynamometry evaluating hip flexion and extension; evaluation of 
functional capacity in a three-dimensional motion laboratory; pain assessment; 
self-reported function, quality of life, expectation and satisfaction with the 
surgery; recording of previous and present sporting activities and 
accelerometry. In addition, data on surgical procedure, rehabilitation progress, 
adverse events and failure will be recorded. Patients will be compared with an 
age-matched and gender-matched reference group of 30 persons with no hip, knee, 
ankle or back problems. Long-term follow-up of this cohort may evaluate possible 
reoperations and development of hip osteoarthritis. Furthermore, analysis on how 
subgroups respond to the treatment could be performed together with 
identification of possible "non-responders".
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Central Denmark Region 
Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (Journal No 1-10-72-239-14). The results 
from this study will be presented at national and international congresses and 
published in peer-reviewed journals.

Medical Center, Pittsburgh, USA.

BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of common femoral and profunda femoris 
arteries has been historically treated with surgical endarterectomy. 
Endovascular treatment of common femoral artery and profunda femoris artery 
disease is increasingly reported in the recent literature. This review 
summarizes short- and mid-term outcomes of endovascular interventions to the 
common femoral artery and common femoral artery.
METHODS: All published series in the English language were identified through a 
systematic PubMed search. Standard descriptive statistics, reported as 
mean ± SD, were applied to perform the pooled analysis and calculate the overall 
outcome measures. Combined overall effect sizes were calculated using 
fixed-effect meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The analysis included 20 studies with a total of 836 patients (897 
limbs, mean age of 70.5 ± 4.3 years, critical limb ischemia 39.6%). Technical 
success was 95%. Angioplasty alone was undertaken in 68.8% of cases and stenting 
in 22.3%. Access complications occurred in 2.4% of cases. Post-operative major 
adverse limb events occurred in 2% and major adverse cardiovascular events in 1% 
of cases. Primary patency at 6, 12 and 24 months was 87%, 77% and 73%, 
respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly higher mean primary 
patency at 12 months for routine stenting compared to a selective stenting 
strategy (91.4% versus 75%; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular interventions to the common femoral artery and common 
femoral artery can be performed safely with high technical success. Endovascular 
therapy may be a favored approach over endarterectomy for highly selected 
patients of poor surgical risk, with limited life expectancy and those with 
wound-healing considerations such as re-operative fields or prone to infection.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of demographic and 
cultural factors on health preferences among Chinese general population.
METHODS: The Chinese EQ-5D-5L valuation study was conducted between December 
2012 and January 2013. A total of 1296 participants were recruited from the 
general public at Beijing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Nanjing, and Shenyang. Each 
participant was interviewed to measure preferences for ten EQ-5D-5L health 
states using composite time trade-off and seven pairs of states using discrete 
choice experiment (data were not included in this study). At the end of the 
interview, each participant was also asked to provide their demographic 
information and answers to two questions about their attitudes towards whether 
bad living is better than good death (LBD) and whether they believe in an 
afterlife. Generalized linear model and random effects logistic models were used 
to examine the impact of demographic and cultural factors on health preferences.
RESULTS: Participants who had serious illness experience received college or 
higher education, or agree with LBD were more likely to value health states 
positively and have a narrower score range. Participants at Beijing were more 
likely to be non-traders, value health states positively, less likely to reach 
the lowest possible score, and have narrower score range compared with all other 
four cities after controlling for all other demographic and culture factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Health state preference is significantly affected by factors beyond 
demographics. These factors should be considered in achieving a representative 
sample in valuation studies in China.

Aging in the Americas: Disability-free Life Expectancy Among Adults Aged 65 and 
Older in the United States, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.

Payne CF(1).

Author information:

Massachusetts.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate and compare disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and 
current age patterns of disability onset and recovery from disability between 
the United States and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
METHOD: Disability is measured using the activities of daily living scale. Data 
come from longitudinal surveys of older adult populations in Costa Rica, Mexico, 
Puerto Rico, and the United States. Age patterns of transitions in and out of 
disability are modeled with a discrete-time logistic hazard model, and a 
microsimulation approach is used to estimate DFLE.
RESULTS: Overall life expectancy for women aged 65 is 20.11 years in Costa Rica, 
19.2 years in Mexico, 20.4 years in Puerto Rico, and 20.5 years in the United 
States. For men, these figures are 19.0 years in Costa Rica, 18.4 years in 
Mexico, 18.1 years in Puerto Rico, and 18.1 years in the United States. 
Proportion of remaining life spent free of disability for women at age 65 is 
comparable between Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the United States, with Costa Rica 
trailing slightly. Male estimates of DFLE are similar across the four 
populations.
DISCUSSION: Though the older adult population of Latin America and the Caribbean 
lived many years exposed to poor epidemiological and public health conditions, 
their functional health in later life is comparable with the older adult 
population of the United States.

Evaluating the ability of the pairwise joint site frequency spectrum to 
co-estimate selection and demography.

Switzerland.

The ability to infer the parameters of positive selection from genomic data has 
many important implications, from identifying drug-resistance mutations in 
viruses to increasing crop yield by genetically integrating favorable alleles. 
Although it has been well-described that selection and demography may result in 
similar patterns of diversity, the ability to jointly estimate these two 
processes has remained elusive. Here, we use simulation to explore the utility 
of the joint site frequency spectrum to estimate selection and demography 
simultaneously, including developing an extension of the previously proposed 
Jaatha program (Mathew et al., 2013). We evaluate both complete and incomplete 
selective sweeps under an isolation-with-migration model with and without 
population size change (both population growth and bottlenecks). Results suggest 
that while it may not be possible to precisely estimate the strength of 
selection, it is possible to infer the presence of selection while estimating 
accurate demographic parameters. We further demonstrate that the common 
assumption of selective neutrality when estimating demographic models may lead 
to severe biases. Finally, we apply the approach we have developed to better 
characterize the within-host demographic and selective history of human 
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection using published next generation sequencing 
data.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown etiology, and life 
expectancy of 3-5 years after diagnosis. The incidence rate in the United States 
is estimated as high as 15 per 100,000 persons per year. The disease is 
characterized by repeated injury to the alveolar epithelium, resulting in 
inflammation and deregulated repair, leading to scarring of the lung tissue, 
resulting in progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia. The disease has no cure, 
although new drugs are in clinical trials and two agents have been approved for 
use by the FDA. In the present paper we develop a mathematical model based on 
the interactions among cells and proteins that are involved in the progression 
of the disease. The model simulations are shown to be in agreement with 
available lung tissue data of human patients. The model can be used to explore 
the efficacy of potential drugs.
