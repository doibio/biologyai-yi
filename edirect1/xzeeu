the associated risk factors.
METHODS: We consecutively recruited asymptomatic PLWH without previous CVD from 
a medical center of Taiwan, and their cardiac function was evaluated by 
conventional echocardiogram and STE. Enrolled PLWH were classified as 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced and ART-naive, and multivariable 
regressions were used to assess the association between myocardial strain and 
risk factors including traditional CVD and HIV-associated factors.
RESULTS: A total of 181 PLWH (mean age: 36.4 ± 11.4 years, 173 males) were 
recruited and conventional echocardiogram parameters were within normal ranges. 
Decreased myocardial strain across the myocardium was found, with a mean left 
ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain of -18.7 ± 2.9%. The LV strain in 
the ART-experienced group (-19.0 ± 2.9%) was significantly better than the 
ART-naive group (-17.9 ± 2.8%), despite a younger age and lesser CVD risk 
factors in the ART-naive group. Hypertension [B = 1.92, 95% confidence interval 
(95% CI) 0.19-3.62, p = 0.029] and ART-naive with both low and high viral loads 
(VL) (B = 1.09, 95% CI 0.03-2.16, p = 0.047; and B = 2.00, 95% CI, 0.22-3.79, 
p = 0.029) were significantly associated with reduced myocardial strain.
CONCLUSION: This is the first and largest cohort using STE to investigate 
myocardial strain in Asian PLWH. Our results suggest that hypertension and 
detectable VL are associated with impaired myocardial strain. Thus, timely ART 
administration with VL suppression and hypertension control are crucial in 
preventing CVD when making the management parallel with the improved life 
expectancy of PLWH on ART.

Differential regulation of gene expression has produced the astonishing 
diversity of life on Earth. Understanding the origin and evolution of 
mechanistic innovations for control of gene expression is therefore integral to 
evolutionary and developmental biology. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is the 
biochemical extension of polyadenosine at the 3'-end of cytoplasmic mRNAs. This 
process regulates the translation of specific maternal transcripts and is 
mediated by the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element-Binding Protein family 
(CPEBs). Genes that code for CPEBs are amongst a very few that are present in 
animals but missing in nonanimal lineages. Whether cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
is present in non-bilaterian animals (i.e., sponges, ctenophores, placozoans, 
and cnidarians) remains unknown. We have conducted phylogenetic analyses of 
CPEBs, and our results show that CPEB1 and CPEB2 subfamilies originated in the 
animal stem lineage. Our assessment of expression in the sea anemone, 
Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria), and the comb jelly, Mnemiopsis leidyi 
(Ctenophora), demonstrates that maternal expression of CPEB1 and the catalytic 
subunit of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation machinery (GLD2) is an ancient 
feature that is conserved across animals. Furthermore, our measurements of 
poly(A)-tail elongation reveal that key targets of cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
are shared between vertebrates, cnidarians, and ctenophores, indicating that 
this mechanism orchestrates a regulatory network that is conserved throughout 
animal evolution. We postulate that cytoplasmic polyadenylation through CPEBs 
was a fundamental innovation that contributed to animal evolution from 
unicellular life.

OBJECTIVE: Emerging research challenges the one-factor model of the future time 
perspective (FTP) scale by demonstrating two- and three-factor models of the FTP 
scale.
METHOD: Three samples (i.e., Switzerland and the United States; N = 2022) 
explored the factor structure, age pattern differences, tested the link between 
FTP factors, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction, as well as age as 
a moderator.
RESULTS: We distinguished FTP into opportunities, extension, and constraint 
factors that corroborated previous research. We did not find a replicable 
curvilinear age pattern difference on any of the FTP factors. The association 
between extension and life satisfaction was stronger among younger than older 
adults. Alternatively, the association between constraint and life satisfaction 
was stronger among younger than older adults in Samples A and C, and the pattern 
was reversed in Sample B. Lastly, the association between constraint and 
environmental mastery was stronger among older adults than younger adults in 
Sample B and the pattern was reversed in Sample C.
CONCLUSION: This variation in the perception of the future is different for 
people at different periods in life and has an important consequence for living 
life well, especially a focus on extension and lack of constraint.

BACKGROUND: To date, it is not fully understood to what extent COVID-19 has 
burdened society in Japan. This study aimed to estimate the total disease burden 
due to COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021.
METHODS: We stratify disease burden estimates by age group and present it as 
absolute Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost and QALYs lost per 100,000 
persons. The total estimated value of QALYs lost consists of (1) QALYs lost 
brought by deaths due to COVID-19, (2) QALYs lost brought by inpatient cases, 
(3) QALYs lost brought by outpatient cases, and (4) QALYs lost brought by 
long-COVID.
RESULTS: The total QALYs lost due to COVID-19 was estimated as 286,782 for two 
years, 114.0 QALYs per 100,000 population per year. 71.3% of them were explained 
by the burden derived from deaths. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
that the burden of outpatient cases was the most sensitive factor.
CONCLUSIONS: The large part of disease burden due to COVID-19 in Japan from the 
beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021 was derived from Wave 3, 4, and 5 and the 
proportion of QALYs lost due to morbidity in the total burden increased 
gradually. The estimated disease burden was smaller than that in other 
high-income countries. It will be our future challenge to take other indirect 
factors into consideration.

Research into perceived wellbeing (WB) can improve understanding of consumer 
food choices and support development of strategies to promote healthier and more 
sustainable eating habits. In this research, using online studies, food-related 
WB was explored among New Zealand consumers. In a "quasi-replication" of Jaeger, 
Vidal, Chheang, and Ares (2022), Study 1 uncovered word associations to 
different WB-related terms ('Sense of wellbeing,' 'Lack of wellbeing,' 'Feeling 
good,' 'Feeling bad/unhappy,' 'Satisfied with life,' and 'Dissatisfied with 
life') with 912 participants in a between-subjects design. The results confirmed 
the multidimensional nature of WB, and the need to consider positive and 
negative aspects of food-related WB, as well as differences linked to physical, 
emotional, and spiritual WB. Drawing on Study 1, 13 characteristics of 
food-related WB were identified, and in Study 2 their importance for feeling a 
'Sense of wellbeing' and 'Satisfied with life' was determined with 1206 
participants using a between-subjects design. In a further extension, Study 2 
also adopted a product-specific perspective and explored the associations of, 
and importance, for 16 different foods and beverages to food-related WB. Based 
on Best-Worst Scaling and penalty/lift analysis, the four most important 
characteristics overall were 'Is good quality,' 'Is healthy,' 'Is fresh,' and 
'Is tasty,' with the nuance that healthiness contributed most to feeling a 
'Sense of wellbeing' while good quality contributed most to feeling 'Satisfied 
with life.' The associations to individual foods and beverages underscored that 
food-related WB is a complex construct arising from an overall evaluation of the 
different effects of foods (including physical health, social and spiritual 
aspects of food consumption) and their short-term effects on food-related 
behaviour. Contextual and individual differences in perceptions of WB in 
relation to food deserve further investigation.

BACKGROUND: End-of-life care requires support for people to die where they feel 
safe and well-cared for. End-of-life care may require funding to support dying 
outside of hospital. In England, funding is procured through Continuing 
Healthcare Fast-Track funding, requiring assessment to determine eligibility. 
Anecdotal evidence suggested that Fast-Track funding applications were deferred 
where clinicians thought this inappropriate due to limited life-expectancy.
AIM: To evaluate overall survival after Fast-Track funding application.
DESIGN: Prospective evaluation of Fast-Track funding application outcomes and 
survival.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: All people in 2021 who had a Fast-Track funding 
application from a medium-sized district general hospital in Southwest England.
RESULTS: 439 people were referred for Fast-Track funding with a median age of 80 
years (range 31-100 years). 413/439 (94.1%) died during follow-up, with a median 
survival of 15 days (range 0-436 days). Median survival for people with 
Fast-Track funding approved or deferred was 18 days and 25 days, respectively 
(p=0.0013). 129 people (29.4%) died before discharge (median survival 4 days) 
and only 7.5% were still alive 90 days after referral for Fast-Track funding.
CONCLUSIONS: Fast-Track funding applications were deferred for those with very 
limited life-expectancy, with minimal clinical difference in survival (7 days) 
compared with those who had applications approved. This is likely to delay 
discharge to the preferred place of death and reduce quality of end-of-life 
care. A blanket acceptance of Fast-Track funding applications, with review for 
those still alive after 60 days, may improve end-of-life care and be more 
efficient for the healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of circulating seasonal influenza strains changed 
following the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1). A universal influenza vaccination 
recommendation has been implemented and new vaccine types have become available 
post-2009. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
routine annual influenza vaccination in the context of this new evidence.
METHODS: A state transition simulation model was constructed to estimate the 
health and economic outcomes of influenza vaccination compared to no vaccination 
for hypothetical US cohorts stratified by age and risk status. Model input 
parameters were derived from multiple sources, including post-2009 vaccine 
effectiveness data from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network. The analysis 
used societal and healthcare sector perspectives and a one-year time horizon, 
except permanent outcomes were also included. The primary outcome was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars per quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, vaccination yielded ICERs lower than 
$95,000/QALY for all age and risk groups, except for non-high-risk adults 
18-49 years ($194,000/QALY). Vaccination was cost-saving for adults ≥50 years at 
higher risk for influenza-related complications. Results were most sensitive to 
changes in the probability of influenza illness. Performing the analysis from 
the healthcare sector perspective, excluding vaccination time costs, delivering 
vaccinations in lower-cost settings, and including productivity losses improved 
the cost-effectiveness of vaccination. Sensitivity analysis revealed that 
vaccination remains below $100,000/QALY for older persons ≥65 years at vaccine 
effectiveness estimates as low as 4 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination varied by age and risk 
status and was less than $95,000/QALY for all subgroups, except for 
non-high-risk working-age adults. Results were sensitive to the probability of 
influenza illness and vaccination was more favorable under certain scenarios. 
Vaccination for higher risk subgroups resulted in ICERs below $100,000/QALY even 
at low levels of vaccine effectiveness or circulating virus.

BACKGROUND: Spodoptera frugiperda is an invasive, widespread agricultural pest 
in China. However, there have been no reports assessing feeding damage on wheat 
caused by S. frugiperda. To clarify the fitness and potential damage of S. 
frugiperda to wheat, this study analyzed the population parameters of S. 
frugiperda fed on wheat in a laboratory and simulated the potential damage in 
field conditions.
RESULTS: The population parameters of S. frugiperda were compared using life 
tables on wheat at the seedling and adult plant stages. The adult female 
longevity of S. frugiperda varied from 12.29 days on seedling plants to 
16.60 days on adult plants. Egg production was significantly higher when fed on 
wheat at the seedling stage (646.34 eggs) than when fed on adult plants (495.86 
eggs). On wheat at the seedling and adult plant stages, the mean generation 
times were 35.42 and 38.34 days, respectively, and the intrinsic rates of 
increase were 0.15 and 0.14, respectively. Spodoptera frugiperda completed 
development and increased its population in wheat at both plant growth stages. 
In the field, the effect of different larval densities on the 1000-kernel weight 
of wheat was significantly different. An action threshold of 40 larvae per m2 
was estimated, and the higher population densities caused a yield loss of 17.7%.
CONCLUSION: Spodoptera frugiperda can complete its life cycle on wheat at 
different stages. Wheat can serve as an alternative host for S. frugiperda. If 
S. frugiperda reaches 320 larvae per m2 density during wheat growth, it will 
cause yield loss exceeding 17%. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Citrus fruit has long been considered a healthy food, but its role and detailed 
mechanism in lifespan extension are not clear. Here, by using the nematode C. 
elegans, we identified that nomilin, a bitter-taste limoloid that is enriched in 
citrus, significantly extended the animals' lifespan, healthspan, and toxin 
resistance. Further analyses indicate that this ageing inhibiting activity 
depended on the insulin-like pathway DAF-2/DAF-16 and nuclear hormone receptors 
NHR-8/DAF-12. Moreover, the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) was identified as 
the mammalian counterpart of NHR-8/DAF-12 and X-ray crystallography showed that 
nomilin directly binds with hPXR. The hPXR mutations that prevented nomilin 
binding blocked the activity of nomilin both in mammalian cells and in C. 
elegans. Finally, dietary nomilin supplementation improved healthspan and 
lifespan in D-galactose- and doxorubicin-induced senescent mice as well as in 
male senescence accelerated mice prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, and induced a longevity 
gene signature similar to that of most longevity interventions in the liver of 
bile-duct-ligation male mice. Taken together, we identified that nomilin may 
extend lifespan and healthspan in animals via the activation of PXR mediated 
detoxification functions.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate whether hypofractionated radiotherapy 
(HYPOFRT) is a cost-effective strategy than conventional fractionated 
radiotherapy (CFRT) for early-stage glottic cancer (ESGC) in the Brazilian 
public and private health systems.
METHODS: Adopting the perspective of the Brazilian public and private health 
system as the payer, a Markov model with a lifetime horizon was built to 
delineate the health states for a cohort of 65-year-old men after with ESGC 
treated with either HYPOFRT or CFRT. Probabilities of controlled disease, local 
failure, distant metastasis, and death and utilities scores were extracted from 
randomized clinical trials. Costs were based on the public and private health 
system reimbursement values.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, for both the public and private health 
systems, HYPOFRT dominated CFRT, being more effective and less costly, with a 
negative ICER of R$264.32 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (public health 
system) and a negative ICER of R$2870.69/ QALY (private health system). The ICER 
was most sensitive to the probability of local failure, controlled disease, and 
salvage treatment costs. For the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicates that there is a probability of 
99.99% of HYPOFRT being cost-effective considering a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of R$2,000 ($905.39) per QALY (public sector) and willingness-to-pay 
threshold of R$16,000 ($7243.10) per QALY (private sector). The results were 
robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering a threshold of R$ 40,000 per QALY, HYPOFRT was 
cost-effective compared to CFRT for ESGC in the Brazilian public health system. 
The Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) is approximately 2,4 times (public health system) 
and 5,2 (private health system) higher for HYPOFRT than CFRT, which could open 
the opportunity of incorporating new technologies.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines the factors that led to the collapse of hemp 
grown for cannabidiol (CBD) in Arizona, the United States of America (USA), and 
particularly in Yuma County, which is a well-established agricultural area in 
the state.
METHODS: This research uses a combination of mapping analysis along with a 
survey of hemp farmers to assess the reasons why the hemp industry collapsed as 
well as to foster solutions to these problems.
RESULTS: In 2019, 5430 acres were sown with hemp seed in Arizona with 3890 acres 
inspected by the state to determine if they could be harvested. By 2021, there 
were only 156 acres planted, and only 128 of those acres were inspected by the 
state for compliance. (Crop mortality accounts for the difference between acres 
sown and acres inspected.) CONCLUSIONS: A lack of knowledge about the hemp life 
cycle greatly contributed to the failure of high CBD hemp crops in Arizona. 
Other problems included noncompliance with tetrahydrocannabinol limits, poor 
sources for seeds and inconsistent genetics of the hemp varieties sold to 
farmers, and diseases that hemp plants were susceptible to such as Pythium crown 
and root rot and beet curly top virus. Addressing these factors will go far in 
making hemp a profitable and widespread crop in Arizona. Additionally, hemp 
grown for other traditional uses (e.g., fiber or seed oil) as well as new 
applications (e.g., microgreens, hempcrete, and phytoremediation) offers other 
pathways for successful hemp agriculture in this state.

Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive brain disorders characterized by 
inexorable synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Since the most consistent 
risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases is aging, the prevalence 
of these disorders is intended to increase with increasing life expectancy. 
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, 
representing a significant medical, social, and economic burden worldwide. 
Despite growing research to reach an early diagnosis and optimal patient 
management, no disease-modifying therapies are currently available. Chronic 
neuroinflammation has been recognized as a crucial player in sustaining 
neurodegenerative processes, along with pathological deposition of misfolded 
proteins, including amyloid-β and tau protein. Modulating neuroinflammatory 
responses may be a promising therapeutic strategy in future clinical trials. 
Among factors that are able to regulate neuroinflammatory mechanisms, diet, and 
nutrients represent easily accessible and modifiable lifestyle components. 
Mediterranean diet and several nutrients, including polyphenols, vitamins, and 
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, can exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
properties, impacting clinical manifestations, cognitive decline, and dementia. 
This review aims to provide an updated overview of the relationship between 
neuroinflammation, nutrition, gut microbiota, and neurodegeneration. We 
summarize the major studies exploring the effects of diet regimes on cognitive 
decline, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's disease dementia and the impact of 
these results on the design of ongoing clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced mortality and improved 
life expectancy among HIV patients but does not provide a cure. Patients must 
remain on lifelong medications and deal with drug resistance and side effects. 
This underscores the need for HIV cure research. However, participation in HIV 
cure research has risks without guaranteed benefits. We determined what HIV 
healthcare providers know about HIV cure research trials, the risks involved, 
and what kind of cure interventions they are likely to recommend for their 
patients.
METHODS: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 39 HIV care providers 
consisting of 12 physicians, 8 counsellors, 14 nurses, 2 pharmacists, 2 
laboratory scientists, and 1 community advocate from three hospitals. Interviews 
were transcribed verbatim and coded, and thematic analysis was performed 
independently by two investigators.
RESULTS: Participants were happy about the success of current treatments and 
hopeful that an HIV cure will be found in the near future, just as ART was 
discovered through research. They described cure as total eradication of the 
virus from the body and inability to test positive for HIV or transmit the 
virus. In terms of risk tolerance, respondents would recommend to their 
patients' studies with mild to moderate risks like what patients on 
antiretroviral therapy experience. Participants were reluctant to recommend 
treatment interruption to patients as part of a cure study and wished trials 
could be performed without stopping treatment. Healthcare providers 
categorically rejected death or permanent disability as an acceptable risk. The 
possibility of finding a cure that will benefit the individual or future 
generations was strong motivations for providers to recommend cure trials to 
their patients, as was transparency and adequate information on proposed trials. 
Overall, the participants were not actively seeking knowledge on cure research 
and lacked information on the various cure modalities under investigation.
CONCLUSION: While hopeful for an HIV cure, healthcare providers in Ghana expect 
a cure to be definitive and pose minimal risk to their patients.

INTRODUCTION: Farm children and youths face unique health risks, including 
increased risk of agricultural injuries (AI), due to the hazardous machinery, 
structures and animals on their residential environment. As a result, they 
experience more severe and complex polytraumatic injuries and longer hospital 
stays compared to those children injured in homes or residences. A major barrier 
to the prevention of AI among children and youth residing on farms is a lack of 
analytic studies about the magnitude and characteristics of these injuries, 
especially in North Dakota.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the Sanford Medical Center Fargo 
trauma registry for pediatric patients (aged 0-19 years) who received care 
between January 2010 and December 2020 for AI. Patients were grouped for 
analysis by the age categories of the Agricultural Youth Work Guidelines (AYWG) 
to compare the mechanisms of injury with the recommended minimum age 
requirements for specific farm tasks.
RESULTS: Of the 41 patients, 26 were male. Mean age was 11 years and one death 
was reported. The most common mechanism of injury was animals (37%), followed by 
falls (20%) and machinery (17%). Children under 6 years and youth aged 16 to 19 
had the highest number of injuries. Females experienced 53% of animal-related 
injuries and males accounted for all vehicle-related injuries.
CONCLUSION: The incidence and severity of polytraumatic AI among young children 
in North Dakota is concerning. Our results underscore the continued need to 
pursue pediatric injury prevention on farms through educational resources and 
programs, including the AWYG.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Parents require more training on age and ability 
appropriate farm tasks, especially animal-related interactions. It is imperative 
that families are given the education and training necessary to integrate 
children into the farm life while protecting them from injury.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with decreased muscle 
force generation. The disturbed force generation process in T2DM could be 
attributed to either or both agonist and antagonist muscles activation. The 
present study aims to assess the effects of T2DM on the interaction of 
antagonist and agonist muscles in the knee joint.
METHODS: The peak torque, root mean square (RMS) of the SEMG signals, the ratio 
of torque/RMS, and the interaction of antagonists and agonist muscles were 
compared between healthy and T2DM patients. Surface ElectroMyoGraphy (SEMG) of 
knee flexor and extensor muscles were recorded during concentric contraction 
with an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/s in 13 T2DM and 12 healthy subjects. The 
independent sample t-tests were used to compare diabetic and healthy subjects. 
The significance level was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: The antagonist/agonist interaction during maximal extension (P = 0.010) 
and flexion (P = 0.022) torques of the knee joint showed significantly lower 
activation of antagonist muscles in T2DM patients than in healthy subjects. 
Lower knee flexion (41.3%) and extension torques (49.1%) and RMS of agonist and 
antagonist muscles were observed in T2DM. The torque/RMS ratio (P > 0.05) showed 
no significant differences in T2DM and healthy subjects.
CONCLUSION: The reduced maximal knee flexor and extensor torques in T2DM are 
accompanied with the decreased myoelectric activity of corresponding muscles. 
The related mechanism could be attributed to lower values of antagonist/agonist 
interaction, which may point out some neural compensatory processes to preserve 
the functional capacity of the neuromuscular system in T2DM.

BACKGROUND: An important contributor to the decreased life expectancy of 
individuals with schizophrenia is sudden cardiac death. While arrhythmic 
disorders play an important role in this, the nature of the relation between 
schizophrenia and arrhythmia is not fully understood.
METHODS: We leveraged summary-level data of large-scale genome-wide association 
studies of schizophrenia (53,386 cases 77,258 controls), arrhythmic disorders 
(atrial fibrillation, 55,114 cases 482,295 controls; Brugada syndrome, 2,820 
cases 10,001 controls) and electrocardiogram traits (heart rate (variability), 
PR interval, QT interval, JT interval, and QRS duration, n=46,952-293,051). 
First, we examined shared genetic liability by assessing global and local 
genetic correlations and conducting functional annotation. Next, we explored 
bidirectional causal relations between schizophrenia and arrhythmic disorders 
and electrocardiogram traits using Mendelian randomization.
OUTCOMES: There was no evidence for global genetic correlations, except between 
schizophrenia and Brugada (rg=0·14, p=4·0E-04). In contrast, strong positive and 
negative local genetic correlations between schizophrenia and all cardiac traits 
were found across the genome. In the strongest associated regions, genes related 
to immune system and viral response mechanisms were overrepresented. Mendelian 
randomization indicated a causal, increasing effect of liability to 
schizophrenia on Brugada syndrome (OR=1·15, p=0·009) and heart rate during 
activity (beta=0·25, p=0·015).
INTERPRETATION: While there was little evidence for global genetic correlations, 
specific genomic regions and biological pathways important for both 
schizophrenia and arrhythmic disorders and electrocardiogram traits emerged. The 
putative causal effect of liability to schizophrenia on Brugada warrants 
increased cardiac monitoring and potentially early medical intervention in 
patients with schizophrenia.

Giant ovarian cysts are categorized with sizes >10 cm. After reaching huge 
diameters, these rare tumors cause clinical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or 
abdominal pain. We present a 29-year-old woman with a giant unique cystadenoma 
represented with unusual clinical features like low back pain and progressive 
constipation. Specific imaging methods demonstrated an adnexal lesion in the 
form of an enormous ovarian cyst; afterward, an open laparotomy was recommended 
to access the abdominal cavity. The critical role of timely diagnosis and 
accurate workups for giant ovarian cysts in increasing patients' life expectancy 
and quality of life is discussed.

humans and other animal species.

Telomeres are the terminal regions of chromosomes that ensure their stability 
while cell division. Telomere shortening initiates cellular senescence, which 
can lead to degeneration and atrophy of tissues, so the process is associated 
with a reduction in life expectancy and predisposition to a number of diseases. 
An accelerated rate of telomere attrition can serve as a predictor of life 
expectancy and health status of an individual. Telomere length is a complex 
phenotypic trait that is determined by many factors, including the genetic ones. 
Numerous studies (including genome-wide association studies, GWAS) indicate the 
polygenic nature of telomere length control. The objective of the present study 
was to characterize the genetic basis of the telomere length regulation using 
the GWAS data obtained during the studies of various human and other animal 
populations. To do so, a compilation of the genes associated with telomere 
length in GWAS experiments was collected, which included information on 270 
human genes, as well as 23, 22, and 9 genes identified in the cattle, sparrow, 
and nematode, respectively. Among them were two orthologous genes encoding a 
shelterin protein (POT1 in humans and pot-2 in C. elegans). Functional analysis 
has shown that telomere length can be influenced by genetic variants in the 
genes encoding: (1) structural components of telomerase; (2) the protein 
components of telomeric regions (shelterin and CST complexes); (3) the proteins 
involved in telomerase biogenesis and regulating its activity; (4) the proteins 
that regulate the functional activity of the shelterin components; (5) the 
proteins involved in telomere replication and/or capping; (6) the proteins 
involved in the alternative telomere lengthening; (7) the proteins that respond 
to DNA damage and are responsible for DNA repair; (8) RNA-exosome components. 
The human genes identified by several research groups in populations of 
different ethnic origins are the genes encoding telomerase components such as 
TERC and TERT as well as STN1 encoding the CST complex component. Apparently, 
the polymorphic loci affecting the functions of these genes may be the most 
reliable susceptibility markers for telomere-related diseases. The systematized 
data about the genes and their functions can serve as a basis for the 
development of prognostic criteria for telomere length-associated diseases in 
humans. Information about the genes and processes that control telomere length 
can be used for marker-assisted and genomic selection in the farm animals, aimed 
at increasing the duration of their productive lifetime.

Publisher: Теломеры – это концевые участки хромосом, обеспечивающие их 
стабильность в ходе клеточного деления. Укорочение теломер инициирует процесс 
старения клеток, что может приводить к дегенерации и атрофии тканей. Укорочение 
теломер связано с сокращением продолжительности жизни и с предрасположенностью к 
ряду заболеваний, поэтому данный показатель может быть использован в качестве 
предиктора продолжительности жизни и состояния здоровья отдельного индивида. 
Длина теломер – сложный фенотипический признак, который определяется многими 
факторами, в том числе генетическими. Многочисленные исследования (включая 
полногеномный анализ ассоциаций, ПГАА) свидетельствуют о полигенном характере 
контроля длины теломер. Цель работы – охарактеризовать генетические основы 
регуляции длины теломер на основе данных ПГАА, полученных при исследовании 
различных популяционных выборок человека и других животных. Для этого авторами 
была собрана компиляция генов, ассоциированных с длиной теломер по данным ПГАА, 
которая включала сведения о 270 генах человека, а также 23, 22 и 9 генах, 
выявленных у крупного рогатого скота, домового воробья и нематоды 
соответственно. Среди них присутствовали два гена-ортолога, кодирующих белок 
шелтеринового комплекса (POT1 у человека и pot-2 у C. elegans). Функциональный 
анализ показал, что на длину теломер могут влиять генетические варианты в генах, 
кодирующих: 1) структурные компоненты теломеразы; 2) белковые компоненты 
теломерных участков хромосом (шелтериновый комплекс и CST комплекс); 3) белки, 
участвующие в биогенезе теломеразы и регулирующие ее активность; 4) белки, 
регулирующие функциональную активность компонентов шелтеринового комплекса; 5) 
белки, участвующие в репликации и/или кэпировании теломер; 6) белки, 
контролирующие альтернативный путь удлинения теломер; 7) белки, реагирующие на 
повреждения ДНК и отвечающие за репарацию; 8) компоненты РНК экзосом. В работе 
выявлены гены человека, идентифицированные несколькими исследовательскими 
группами в популяциях различного этнического происхождения. Это гены, кодирующие 
компоненты теломеразы (TERC и TERT), а также ген STN1, кодирующий белок CST 
комплекса. По-видимому, полиморфные локусы, затрагивающие функции этих генов, 
могут быть наиболее надежными маркерами предрасположенности к заболеваниям, 
связанным с длиной теломер. Систематизированные нами данные о генах и их 
функциях будут полезны при разработке прогностических критериев заболеваний 
человека, для которых показана связь с длиной теломер. Сведения о генах и 
процессах, контролирующих длину теломер, могут быть востребованы для 
маркер-ориентированной и геномной селекции сельскохозяйственных животных, 
направленной на повышение продолжительности их хозяйственного использования.
