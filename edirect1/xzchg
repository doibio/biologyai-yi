OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to illustrate the potential benefit of 
effective congestive heart failure (CHF) treatment in terms of improved health, 
greater social value, and reduced health disparities between black and white 
subpopulations.
BACKGROUND: CHF affects 5.7 million Americans, costing $32 billion annually in 
treatment expenditures and lost productivity. CHF also contributes to health 
disparities between black and white Americans: black subjects develop CHF at a 
younger age and are more likely to be hospitalized and die of this disease. 
Improved CHF treatment could generate significant health benefits and reduce 
health disparities.
METHODS: We adapted an established economic-demographic microsimulation to 
estimate scenarios in which a hypothetical innovation eliminates the incidence 
of CHF and, separately, 6 other diseases in patients 51 to 52 years of age in 
2016. This cohort was followed up until death. We estimated total life years, 
quality-adjusted life years, and disability-free life years with and without the 
innovation, for the population overall and for race- and sex-defined 
subpopulations.
RESULTS: CHF prevalence among 65- to 70-year-olds increased from 4.3% in 2012 to 
8.5% in 2030. Diagnosis with CHF coincided with significant increases in 
disability and medical expenditures, particularly among black subjects. 
Preventing CHF among those 51 to 52 years of age in 2016 would generate nearly 
2.9 million additional life years, 1.1 million disability-free life years, and 
2.1 million quality-adjusted life years worth $210 to $420 billion. These 
gains are greater among black subjects than among white subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: CHF prevalence will increase substantially over the next 2 decades 
and will affect black Americans more than white Americans. Improved CHF 
treatment could generate significant social value and reduce existing health 
disparities.

China has the largest population of adults with hypertension in the world. 
Recent clinical trials have shown that intensive hypertension control can help 
patients achieve lower blood pressure and reduce the incidence of major 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, but this level of hypertension control also 
incurs additional costs to patients and society and may result in a substantial 
increase in adverse events. The objective of this study is to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of intensive hypertension control to inform health 
policymakers and health care delivery systems in China in their decision-making 
regarding hypertension treatment strategies. We developed a Markov based 
simulation model of hypertension to assess the impact of intensive and standard 
hypertension control strategies for the Chinese population who are diagnosed 
with hypertension. Model parameters were estimated based on the best available 
data and the literature. We projected that intensive hypertension control would 
avert about 2.2 million coronary heart disease events and 4.4 million stroke 
events for all hypertensive patients in China in 10 years compared to standard 
hypertension control. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
intensive hypertension control was estimated at 7876 CNY per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) compared to standard hypertension control. Intensive 
hypertension control would be more cost-effective than standard hypertension 
control in China. Our findings indicated that China should consider expanding 
intensive hypertension control among hypertensive patients given its great 
potential in preventing CVD.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-utility of the addition of 
different doses of Pilates to an advice for non-specific chronic low back pain 
(NSCLBP) from a societal perspective.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation.
SETTING: Physiotherapy clinic in São Paulo, Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS: 296 patients with NSCLBP.
INTERVENTIONS: All patients received advice and were randomly allocated to four 
groups (n=74 per group): booklet group (BG), Pilates once a week (Pilates group 
1, PG1), Pilates twice a week (Pilates group 2, PG2) and Pilates three times a 
week (Pilates group 3, PG3).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were pain and disability at 6-week 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared with the BG, all Pilates groups showed significant 
improvements in pain (PG1, mean difference (MD)=-1.2, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.3; PG2, 
MD=-2.3, 95% CI -3.2 to -1.4; PG3, MD=-2.1, 95% CI -3.0 to -1.1) and disability 
(PG1, MD=-1.9, 95% CI -3.6 to -0.1; PG2, MD=-4.7, 95% CI -6.4 to -3.0; PG3, 
MD=-3.3, 95% CI -5.0 to -1.6). Among the different doses, PG2 showed significant 
improvements in comparison with PG1 for pain (MD=-1.1, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.1) and 
disability (MD=-2.8, 95% CI -4.5 to -1.1). The cost-utility analysis showed that 
PG3 had a 0.78 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of 
£20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding two sessions of Pilates exercises to advice provided better 
outcomes in pain and disability than advice alone for patients with NSCLBP; 
non-specific elements such as greater attention or expectation might be part of 
this effect. The cost-utility analysis showed that Pilates three times a week 
was the preferred option.

INTRODUCTION: While myeloma is an incurable malignancy, developments in disease 
management have led to increased life expectancy in recent years. Treatment 
typically involves stem-cell transplantation. Increased survival rates equate to 
more patients living with the burden of both the disease and its treatment for 
increasing number of years, rendering myeloma a long-term condition.Evidence 
exists to demonstrate the benefits of exercise for patients recovering from 
stem-cell transplantation, and prehabilitation-exercise before treatment-has 
been shown to be effective in other disease areas. To date there has been no 
research into prehabilitation in patients with myeloma awaiting transplantation 
treatment.Our objective is to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a 
randomised controlled trial into pretransplant exercise for patients with 
multiple myeloma who are awaiting autologous stem-cell transplantation.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This mixed methods study identifies patients with 
diagnosis of multiple myeloma who have been assigned to the autologous 
transplantation list and invites them to participate in six weekly sessions of 
individualised, supervised exercise while awaiting transplantation.Quantitative 
data to determine feasibility targets include rates of recruitment, adherence 
and adverse events, and outcome measures including 6 min walking distance test 
and quality of life.Qualitative interviews are undertaken with a purposive 
sample of patients to capture their experiences of the study and the 
intervention.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics committee approval has been obtained. 
Dissemination will be through open-access publications and presentations and 
will seek to reach multiprofessional bases as well as patients and carer groups, 
addressing the widespread interest in this area of research.

A European League Against Rheumatism-American College of Rheumatology working 
group consisting of practising and academic rheumatologists, a rheumatology 
researcher and a patient representative created a succinct general statement 
describing rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) in adults and children 
in language that can be used in conversations with the lay public, media, 
healthcare providers and other stakeholders. Based on the literature review, 
several elements were deemed important for inclusion in the description of RMDs. 
First, RMDs encompass many different diseases that can affect individuals at any 
age, including children. Second, there are various pathophysiological pathways 
underlying different RMDs. Third, the impact of RMDs on individuals and society 
should be emphasised. The working group agreed that the language should be 
comprehensible to the lay public. Thus, the following description of RMDs has 
been developed: 'Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) are a diverse 
group of diseases that commonly affect the joints, but can affect any organ of 
the body. There are more than 200 different RMDs, affecting both children and 
adults. They are usually caused by problems of the immune system, inflammation, 
infections or gradual deterioration of joints, muscles and bones. Many of these 
diseases are long term and worsen over time. They are typically painful and 
limit function. In severe cases, RMDs can result in significant disability, 
having a major impact on both quality of life and life expectancy.' This 
description can be used by rheumatology groups, researchers and those who work 
in advocacy and education related to RMDs.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness 
of rapid-acting analog insulin relative to regular human insulin in adults with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus in Germany.
METHODS: The PRIME Diabetes Model, a patient-level, discrete event simulation 
model, was used to project long-term clinical and cost outcomes for patients 
with type 1 diabetes from the perspective of a German healthcare payer. 
Simulated patients had a mean age of 21.5 years, duration of diabetes of 
8.6 years, and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin of 7.39%. Regular human insulin 
and rapid-acting analog insulin regimens reduced glycosylated hemoglobin by 
0.312 and 0.402%, respectively. Compared with human insulin, hypoglycemia rate 
ratios with rapid-acting analog insulin were 0.51 (non-severe nocturnal) and 
0.80 (severe). No differences in non-severe diurnal hypoglycemia were modeled. 
Discount rates of 3% were applied to future costs and clinical benefits accrued 
over the 50-year time horizon.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, rapid-acting analog insulin was associated 
with an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.01 quality-adjusted 
life-years per patient (12.54 vs. 11.53 quality-adjusted life-years). 
Rapid-acting analog insulin was also associated with an increase in direct costs 
of €4490, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €4427 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. human insulin. Sensitivity analyses showed 
that the base case was driven predominantly by differences in hypoglycemia; 
abolishing these differences reduced incremental quality-adjusted life 
expectancy to 0.07 quality-adjusted life-years, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €74,622 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid-acting analog insulin is associated with beneficial outcomes 
in patients with type 1 diabetes and is likely to be considered cost effective 
in the German setting vs. regular human insulin.

Additional Surgical Method Aimed to Increase Distractive Force during 
Occipitocervical Stabilization : Technical Note.

Antar V(1), Turk O(1).

Author information:

Istanbul, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junctional anomalies constitute a technical 
challenge. Surgical opening of atlantoaxial joint region is a complex procedure 
especially in patients with nuchal deformity like basilar invagination. This 
region has actually very complicated anatomical and functional characteristics, 
including multiple joints providing extension, flexion, and wide rotation. In 
fact, it is also a bottleneck region where bones, neural structures, and blood 
vessels are located. Stabilization surgery regarding this region should consider 
the fact that the area exposes excessive and life-long stress due to complex 
movements and human posture. Therefore, all options should be considered for 
surgical stabilization, and they could be interchanged during the surgery, if 
required.
METHODS: A 53-year-old male patient applied to outpatients' clinic with 
complaints of head and neck pain persisting for a long time. Physical 
examination was normal except increased deep tendon reflexes. The patient was on 
long-term corticosteroid due to an allergic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging 
and computed tomography findings indicated basilar invagination and atlantoaxial 
dislocation. The patient underwent C0-C3-C4 (lateral mass) and additional C0-C2 
(translaminar) stabilization surgery.
RESULTS: In routine practice, the sites where rods are bound to occipital plates 
were placed as paramedian. Instead, we inserted lateral mass screw to the sites 
where occipital screws were inserted on the occipital plate, thereby creating a 
site where extra rod could be bound. When C2 translaminar screw is inserted, 
screw caps remain on the median plane, which makes them difficult to bind to 
contralateral system. These bind directly to occipital plate without any 
connection from this region to the contralateral system. Advantages of this 
technique include easy insertion of C2 translaminar screws, presence of 
increased screw sizes, and exclusion of pullout forces onto the screw from neck 
movements. Another advantage of the technique is the median placement of the 
rod; i.e., thick part of the occipital bone is in alignment with axial loading.
CONCLUSION: We believe that this technique, which could be easily performed as 
adjuvant to classical stabilization surgery with no need for special screw and 
rod, may improve distraction force in patients with low bone density.

Plant defensins are small, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides of the immune 
system found in several organs during plant development. A synthetic peptide, 
KT43C, a linear analogue of the native Cp-thionin II found in cowpea seeds, was 
evaluated for its antifungal potential. It was found that KT43C displayed 
antifungal activity against Fusarium culmorum, Penicillium expansum and 
Aspergillus niger. Like native plant defensins, KT43C showed thermostability up 
to 100 °C and cation sensitivity. The synthetic peptide decreased the fungal 
growth without inducing morphogenic changes in the fungal hyphae. Non-inhibitory 
concentrations of the peptide induced permeabilization of the fungal membrane. 
In addition, high concentrations of KT43C induced the production of reactive 
oxygen species in the granulated cytoplasm. To investigate potential 
applications, the peptide was used as an additive in the preparation of dough 
which did not contain yeast. This peptide delayed the development of fungal 
growth in the dough by 2 days. Furthermore, KT43C did not induce red blood cell 
lysis up to a concentration of 200 μg.ml-1. These results highlight the 
potential for the use of synthetic antimicrobial defensins for shelf-life 
extension of food products.

The elevated cardiovascular risk of patients with schizophrenia contributes to a 
reduced life expectancy of 15-20years. This study investigated whether cardiac 
autonomic dysfunction (CADF) in schizophrenia is related to chronotropic 
incompetence, an established cardiovascular risk marker. We investigated 
thirty-two patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and thirty-two control 
subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index and fat free mass. A 
cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was performed to study heart rate responses 
to exercise as well as submaximal (ventilatory threshold 1, VT1) and maximal 
endurance capacities (peak oxygen consumption, VO2peak; peak power output, 
Ppeak). In addition, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were assessed in a 
subset of patients. Fitness parameters were significantly reduced in all 
patients. Most investigated physiological parameters were significantly 
different at rest as well as during peak exercise being in line with previously 
described CADF in schizophrenia. In particular, 14 out of 32 patients were 
classified as chronotropically incompetent whereas no control subject was below 
the cut-off value. In addition, a positive correlation of a slope reflecting 
chronotropic incompetence with peak oxygen uptake (p<0.001) was observed in 
patients only indicating a close correlation to the lack of physical fitness. 
The catecholamine increase was reduced in patients after exercise. This study 
identified a novel cardiac risk factor in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, 
it seems to be associated with reduced physical fitness and indicates targets 
for exercise intervention studies. Future studies are warranted to elucidate 
pathophysiological mechanisms of this cardiac condition.

Elosulfase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy for Morquio A syndrome 
(mucopolysaccharidosis IVA), a multisystemic progressive lysosomal storage 
disorder. This report includes the primary treatment outcomes and immunogenicity 
profile of elosulfase alfa in patients with Morquio A syndrome from 2 sequential 
studies, MOR-002 (ClinicalTrials.govNCT00884949) and MOR-100 (NCT01242111), 
representing >5 years of clinical study data. MOR-002 was an open-label, 
single-arm phase 1/2 study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, 
immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of 3 sequential doses of elosulfase 
alfa (0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg/week) in patients with Morquio A syndrome (n = 20) 
over 36 weeks, followed by an optional 36- to 48-week treatment period using 
elosulfase alfa 1.0 mg/kg once weekly (qw). During the 0.1 mg/kg dosing phase, 1 
patient discontinued due to a type I hypersensitivity adverse event (AE), and 
that patient's sibling voluntarily discontinued in the absence of AEs. An 
additional patient discontinued due to recurrent infusion reactions during the 
1.0 mg/kg continuation phase. The remaining 17 patients completed MOR-002 and 
enrolled in MOR-100, an open-label, long-term extension study that further 
evaluated safety and clinical outcomes with elosulfase alfa administered at 
2.0 mg/kg qw. During the course of MOR-100, patients were given the option of 
receiving elosulfase alfa infusions at home with nursing assistance. Over the 
course of both studies, all patients experienced ≥1 AE and most patients 
experienced a drug-related AE, generally of mild or moderate severity. 
Hypersensitivity reactions reported as related to study drug occurred in 25% of 
patients. Thirteen patients who chose to receive infusions at home had the same 
tolerability and safety profile, as well as comparable compliance rates, as 
patients who chose to receive on-site infusions. All patients developed 
antibodies to elosulfase alfa. Positivity for neutralizing antibodies was 
associated with increased drug half-life and decreased drug clearance. Despite 
formation of antidrug-binding (total antidrug antibodies, TAb) and in vitro 
neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in all patients, these types of immunogenicity to 
elosulfase alfa were not correlated with safety or clinical outcomes. In 
contrast with the reported natural history of Morquio A, no trends toward 
decreasing endurance, respiratory function, or ability to perform activities of 
daily living were observed in this cohort over the 5-year period.

Chronic diseases are considered to be major determinants of frailty and it could 
be hypothesized that their treatment may counteract the development of frailty. 
However, the hypothesis that intensive treatment of chronic diseases might 
reduce the progression of frailty is poorly supported by existing studies. In 
contrast, some evidence suggests that intensive treatment of chronic diseases 
may increase negative health outcomes in frail older adults. In particular, if 
treatment of symptoms related to chronic diseases (i.e. pain in osteoarthritis, 
dyspnoea in respiratory disease, motor symptoms in Parkinson disease) might 
potentially reverse frailty, the benefits related to preventive pharmacological 
treatment of chronic diseases (i.e. antihypertensive treatment) in patients with 
prevalent frailty is not certain. In particular, several factors might alter the 
risk/benefit ratio of a given treatment in persons with frailty. These include: 
exclusion of frail persons from clinical studies, reduced life expectancy in 
frail persons, increased susceptibility to iatrogenic events, and functional 
deficits associated with frailty. Therefore, frailty acts as an effect modifier, 
by modifying the risks and benefits of chronic disease treatments. This 
hypothesis must be considered and tested in future clinical intervention studies 
and clinical guidelines should provide specific recommendations for the 
treatment of frail people, underlining the pros and the cons of pharmacological 
treatment and possible targets for therapy in this population. Meanwhile, in 
older patients, the prescribing process should be individualized and flexible.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The central question of preoperative assessment is not "What 
can be done?" but "What should be done and how?" Predicting a patient's risk of 
unwanted outcomes is vital to answering this question. This review discusses 
risk prediction tools currently available and anticipates future developments.
RECENT FINDINGS: Simple, parsimonious risk scales and scores are being replaced 
by complex risk prediction models as high-capacity information systems become 
ubiquitous. The accuracy of risk estimation will be further increased by 
improved assessment of physical fitness, frailty, and incorporation of existing 
and novel biomarkers. However, the limitations of risk prediction for individual 
patient care must be recognized.
SUMMARY: Risk prediction is transforming from clinical estimation to statistical 
science. Predictions should be used within the context of a patient's baseline 
risk (life expectancy independent of surgery), personal circumstances, quality 
of life, their expectations and values, and consideration of outcomes that are 
meaningful for the patient.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively extends the life expectancy of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals; however, age-related 
morbidities have emerged as major clinical concerns. In this context, 
coinfection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) accelerates immune senescence and 
elevates risk for other age-related morbidities, possibly through increased 
inflammation. We investigated potential relationships between CMV memory 
inflation, immune senescence, and inflammation by measuring markers of 
inflammation and telomere lengths of different lymphocyte subsets in 
HIV-infected individuals seropositive for anti-CMV antibodies. Our study cohort 
consists mainly of middle aged men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals 
who are stable under long-term ART. Median levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were 
significantly higher in those coinfected with CMV. Lymphocyte telomere length in 
general correlated with age, but for 32/32 subjects tested, there was a 
consistent hierarchy of telomere lengths with CD8+ T cells' shorter than the 
general lymphocyte population, CD57+CD8+ T cells' shorter than CD8+ T cells' and 
CMV-specific CD57+CD8+ T cells' the shortest of all. Telomeres of HIV-specific 
CD8+ T cells were longer than those of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in all cases 
tested and over 10 years, CMV-specific CD8+ T cell telomeres of two HIV-infected 
individuals eroded faster than those of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. These data 
indicate that CMV-specific CD8+ T cells of HIV-infected individuals are the 
lymphocytes closest to telomere-imposed replicative senescence. Exhaustive 
proliferation of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals is a 
potential source of senescent lymphocytes affecting systemic immune function and 
inflammation.

Life-saving technology used to treat catastrophic illnesses such as heart 
disease and cancer is often out of reach for the poor. As life expectancy 
increases in poor countries and the burden from chronic illnesses continues to 
rise, so will the unmet need for expensive tertiary care. Understanding how best 
to increase access to and reduce the financial burden of expensive tertiary care 
is a crucial task for the global health community in the coming decades. In 
2010, Karnataka, a state in India, rolled out the Vajpayee Arogyashree scheme 
(VAS), a social health insurance scheme focused on increasing access to tertiary 
care for households below the poverty line. VAS was rolled out in a way that 
allowed for robust evaluation of its causal effects and several studies have 
examined various impacts of the scheme on poor households. In this analysis 
article, we summarise the key findings and assess how these findings can be used 
to inform other social health insurance schemes. First, the evidence suggests 
that VAS led to a substantial reduction in mortality driven by increased 
tertiary care utilisation as well as use of better quality facilities and 
earlier diagnosis. Second, VAS significantly reduced the financial burden of 
receiving tertiary care. Third, these benefits of social health insurance were 
achieved at a reasonable cost to society and taxpayers. Several unique features 
of VAS led to its success at improving health and financial well-being including 
effective outreach via health camps, targeting expensive conditions with high 
disease burden, easy enrolment process, cashless treatment, bundled payment for 
hospital services, participation of both public and private hospitals and prior 
authorisation to improve appropriateness of care.

AIMS: Cardiovascular ageing is a key determinant of life expectancy. Cellular 
senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, is an important 
contributor to ageing due to the accumulation of damaged cells. Targeting 
cellular senescence could prevent age-related cardiovascular diseases. In this 
study, we investigated the effects of neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), an epidermal growth 
factor with cardioprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects, on cellular 
senescence.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Senescence was induced in cultured rat aortic endothelial 
cells (ECs) and aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) by 2 h exposure to 30 µM 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cellular senescence was confirmed after 72 h using 
senescence-associated-β-galactosidase staining (SA-β-gal), cell surface area, 
and western blot analyses of SA pathways (acetyl-p53, p21). Recombinant human 
NRG-1 (rhNRG-1, 20 ng/mL) significantly reduced H2O2-induced senescence, as 
shown by a lower number of SA-β-gal positive cells, smaller surface area and 
lower expression of acetyl-p53. In C57BL/6 male mice rendered diabetic with 
streptozotocin (STZ), rhNRG-1 attenuated cellular senescence in aortic ECs and 
SMCs. Next, we created mice with SMC-specific knockdown of the NRG-1 receptor 
ErbB4. Aortic SMCs isolated from SMC-specific ErbB4 deficient mice (ErbB4f/+ 
SM22α-Cre+) showed earlier cellular senescence in vitro compared with wild-type 
(ErbB4+/+ SM22α-Cre+) SMCs. Furthermore, when rendered diabetic with STZ, 
ErbB4f/+ SM22α-Cre+ male mice showed significantly more vascular senescence than 
their diabetic wild-type littermates and had increased mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to explore the role of NRG-1 in vascular 
senescence. Our data demonstrate that NRG-1 markedly inhibits stress-induced 
premature senescence in vascular cells in vitro and in the aorta of diabetic 
mice in vivo. Consistently, deficiency in the NRG-1 receptor ErbB4 provokes 
cellular senescence in vitro as well as in vivo.

Background Despite the chronic, progressive, and life-threatening nature of 
cystic fibrosis (CF), there are no guidelines for when and how to communicate 
prognosis to children with CF.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with young adults with CF, parents of young 
adults with CF, and multidisciplinary CF health care providers assessed recall 
of and practices for communicating about prognosis. Recommendations for 
improvements were also solicited.
RESULTS: Young adults with CF recalled learning that life expectancy is limited 
by CF between the ages of 8 and 16 years, and that CF is a progressive disease 
between the ages of 7 and 19 years. They reported that the information often 
came from CF physicians or from online resources. Patients and parents reported 
earlier knowledge of prognosis than providers assumed. While learning about 
prognosis caused sadness and stress for some patients and families, others 
denied negative feelings. Interestingly, most patients reported that disclosure 
of prognosis had minimal impact on their adherence and treatment goals. Patients 
and parents reported wanting physicians to be involved in conversations about 
prognosis. However, providers noted several barriers to discussing prognosis, 
including their own reluctance, time limitations, and uncertainty about 
appropriate timing and content of communication.
CONCLUSIONS: Communication about prognosis is important but also difficult for 
providers, patients, and families. Appropriately timed conversations, using 
tools to facilitate communication, could ensure patients receive timely, 
accurate information.

personality disorder and community adults in daily life: A replication and 
extension.

Affective instability and interpersonal stress are key features of borderline 
personality disorder (BPD). They were shown to covary in the daily lives of 
patients in a recent ambulatory assessment study (Hepp et al., 2017) that 
observed comparatively larger positive associations between interpersonal 
stressors and negative affect in individuals with BPD than those with depressive 
disorders. The present study sought to replicate these findings, collecting data 
on hostility, sadness, fear, and rejection or disagreement events from 56 BPD 
and 60 community control participants for 21 days, 6 times a day. Using 
identical statistical procedures, the positive associations between momentary 
rejection/disagreement and hostility, sadness, and fear were replicated. Again 
replicating the original study, the rejection-hostility, rejection-sadness, and 
disagreement-hostility associations were significantly stronger in the BPD 
group. Time-lagged analyses extended the original study, revealing that 
rejection was associated with subsequent hostility and sadness more strongly in 
the BPD group, as was disagreement with subsequent hostility and fear. Though 
small, we argue that the observed group differences reflect meaningful pervasive 
responses in a daily life context. Future research should consider these when 
implementing affect regulation strategies that are applicable in interpersonal 
contexts for all individuals, but particularly those with BPD. (PsycINFO

Recent years have witnessed a great gain in knowledge regarding parasite-host 
cell interactions during Plasmodium liver stage development. It is now an 
accepted fact that a large percentage of sporozoites invading hepatocytes fail 
to form infectious merozoites. There appears to be a delicate balance between 
parasite survival and elimination and we now start to understand why this is so. 
Plasmodium liver stage parasites replicate within the parasitophorous vacuole 
(PV), formed during invasion by invagination of the host cell plasma membrane. 
The main interface between the parasite and hepatocyte is the parasitophorous 
vacuole membrane (PVM) that surrounds the PV. Recently, it was shown that 
autophagy marker proteins decorate the PVM of Plasmodium liver stage parasites 
and eliminate a proportion of them by an autophagy-like mechanism. Successfully 
developing Plasmodium berghei parasites are initially also labeled but in the 
course of development, they are able to control this host defense mechanism by 
shedding PVM material into the tubovesicular network (TVN), an extension of the 
PVM that releases vesicles into the host cell cytoplasm. Better understanding of 
the molecular events at the PVM/TVN during parasite elimination could be the 
basis of new antimalarial measures.

Live Longer Better: The Historical Roots of Human Growth Hormone as Anti-Aging 
Medicine.

California San Francisco, SF, CA 94118.

In recent years, historians have turned their attention to the emergence of 
anti-aging medicine, suggesting that this interest group coalesced in the wake 
of widespread availability of recombinant human growth hormone (HGH) after 1985. 
We take a longer view of modern anti-aging medicine, unearthing a nexus of 
scientific, medical, and cultural factors that developed over several decades in 
the twentieth century to produce circumstances conducive to the emergence of 
this medical sub-specialty established on the premise of the anti-aging effects 
of HGH. Specifically, we locate these roots in earlier hormone replacement 
therapies and in the so-called life extension movement. We reveal the continual 
tension between, on the one hand, champions of a mainstream medical specialty 
and a field of biomedical research that aimed to improve health for the aged 
and, on the other hand, advocates who campaigned for medical endeavors to 
preserve midlife health in perpetuity, and even to extend the human lifespan. We 
also demonstrate that the two groups shared a belief in science to solve - or at 
least to ameliorate - the problems of aging. This commitment to science has been 
the hallmark of twentieth and twenty-first century prescriptions for living life 
longer and better.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex genetic, late age-onset, 
progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to the death of upper and lower 
motor neurons. Life expectancy after diagnosis is short due to the ongoing 
degeneration and to the lack of effective treatments. Axonal alterations, 
mitochondrial deficits, RNA changes, protein misfolding and turnover, glial 
dysfunction and hyperexcitability are key players in molecular mechanisms 
involved in the degeneration of motor neurons. In the context of 
hyperexcitability, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, which are widely 
distributed throughout the central nervous system and act through many 
intracellular signaling pathways, are emerging as novel potential drug targets 
for the therapeutic treatment of ALS, as they are able to counteract 
excitotoxicity by reducing glutamate release and inducing the production of 
neurotrophic factors.

BACKGROUND: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative 
(FACIT-Pal) 14 instrument measures the quality of life in palliative care 
patients but its psychometric properties are not well characterized.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the reliability and validity of the FACIT-Pal 14 in an 
outpatient palliative care clinic population.
METHODS: The FACIT-Pal 14 was administered to 227 patients in an outpatient 
palliative care clinic at a large, urban academic medical center. Internal 
consistency reliability was assessed with Crohnbach's α, and principal component 
analysis was used to investigate for multiple underlying latent variables. 
Construct validity was tested by comparing mean scores in various subgroups.
