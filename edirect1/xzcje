the proportion reaching old ages, the Finnish lagged behind from the beginning, 
but females decreased this difference. The Danes were more similar to the other 
countries at the beginning, but did not experience the same increase over time. 
Gender-specific LE at age 75 and 90 years was similar overall in the five 
countries. Conclusions: Developments in cross-country variation suggest that 
survival until old age has become more similar for Finnish females and more 
different for Danish males and females compared with the other countries in 
recent decades. This provides perspectives on the potential to improve longevity 
in Denmark and Finland. Similarities in LE in old age suggest that expected 
mortality in old age has been more similar throughout the study period.

Clinical trial design most often focuses on a single or several related outcomes 
with corresponding calculations of statistical power. We consider a clinical 
trial to be a decision problem, often with competing outcomes. Using a current 
controversy in the treatment of HPV-positive head and neck cancer, we apply 
several different probabilistic methods to help define the range of outcomes 
given different possible trial designs. Our model incorporates the uncertainties 
in the disease process and treatment response and the inhomogeneities in the 
patient population. Instead of expected utility, we have used a Markov model to 
calculate quality adjusted life expectancy as a maximization objective. Monte 
Carlo simulations over realistic ranges of parameters are used to explore 
different trial scenarios given the possible ranges of parameters. This modeling 
approach can be used to better inform the initial trial design so that it will 
more likely achieve clinical relevance.

Despite recent advances in chemotherapy and surgical resection, the 5-year 
survival rate of esophageal cancer still remains at the low level. Therefore, it 
is very important to discover a new agent to improve the life expectancy of 
patients with esophageal cancer. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semisynthetic 
derivative of artemisinin, has recently exhibited promising anticancer activity 
against various cancer cells. But so far, the specific mechanism remains 
unclear. We have previously demonstrated that DHA reduced viability of 
esophageal cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and induced cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here, we extended our study to further observe the 
efficacy of DHA on esophageal cancer cells in vivo. In the present study, for 
the first time, we found that DHA significantly inhibits cell proliferation in 
xenografted tumor compared with the control. The mechanism was that DHA induced 
cell apoptosis in both human esophageal cancer cell lines Eca109 and Ec9706 in 
vivo in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggested that DHA was a promising 
agent against esophageal cancer in the clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (CRT) in rectal cancer patients 
is associated with a reduction in physical capacity, lean mass and increased 
fatigue. As a countermeasure to these treatment-related adverse effects, we 
examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 10-week exercise program 
during CRT.
METHODS: Ten rectal cancer patients (7 men, aged 27-70 years, body mass index = 
26.4 ± 3.8 kg/m2) receiving CRT undertook supervised resistance and aerobic 
exercise twice weekly. Assessments were undertaken pre- and post-intervention 
for upper and lower body muscle strength by 1-RM, muscle endurance, physical 
performance tests, body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry, quality of 
life, and fatigue.
RESULTS: There was a significant loss in appendicular skeletal muscle (-1.1 kg, 
P = .012), and fat mass (-0.8 kg, P = .029) following CRT. Despite the loss in 
skeletal muscle, leg press ( P = .030) and leg extension ( P = .046) strength 
improved by 27.2% and 22.7%, respectively, and leg press endurance by 76.7% ( P 
= .007). Changes in strength were accompanied by improved performance ( P < .05) 
in 6-m fast walking speed (6.9%) and dynamic balance as determined by the 6-m 
backwards walk (15.5%). There was minimal change in quality of life and fatigue, 
and no adverse events related to training.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise during neoadjuvant CRT appears to be feasible and well 
tolerated in rectal cancer patients and may enhance physical function while 
minimizing adverse changes in body composition and cancer-related fatigue. These 
initial findings need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials.

Despite the reduced life expectancy and staggering financial burden of medical 
treatment associated with tobacco smoking, the molecular, cellular, and ensemble 
adaptations associated with chronic nicotine consumption remain poorly 
understood. Complex circuitry interconnecting dopaminergic and cholinergic 
regions of the midbrain and mesopontine tegmentum are critical for nicotine 
associated reward. Yet our knowledge of the nicotine activation of these regions 
is incomplete, in part due to their cell type diversity. We performed double 
immunohistochemistry for the immediate early gene and surrogate activity sensor, 
c-Fos, and markers for either cholinergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic cell types 
in mice treated with nicotine. Both acute (0.5 mg/kg) and chronic (0.5 mg/kg/day 
for 7 days) nicotine strongly activated GABAergic neurons of the interpeduncular 
nucleus and medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract (MT). Acute but 
not chronic nicotine also activated small percentages of dopaminergic and other 
neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as well as noncholinergic neurons in 
the pedunculotegmental and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (PTg/LDTg). Twenty four 
hours of nicotine withdrawal after chronic nicotine treatment suppressed c-Fos 
activation in the MT. In comparison to nicotine, a single dose of cocaine caused 
a similar activation in the PTg/LDTg but not the VTA where GABAergic cells were 
strongly activated but dopaminergic neurons were not affected. These results 
indicate the existence of drug of abuse specific ensembles. The loss of ensemble 
activation in the VTA and PTg/LDTg after chronic nicotine represents a molecular 
and cellular tolerance which may have implications for the mechanisms underlying 
nicotine dependence.

OBJECTIVE: To establish aspirational 'gold standards' for a suite of 
System-Level Measures (SLMs) being used by Counties Manukau Health (CM Health), 
a New Zealand (NZ) District Health Board.
DESIGN: This study employed a multi-stage, multi-method modified Delphi 
consensus process.
SETTING: The Delphi consensus process involved virtual (email) communication 
between participants (Round 1) and a structured face-to-face meeting (Round 2) 
held in Auckland, NZ.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised of health professionals, managers, 
academics and quality improvement experts with an interest in the use of SLMs.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the first round received a letter requesting 
their participation in an anonymous Delphi. The second round involved national 
and international health system experts taking part in a structured, facilitated 
face-to-face meeting. Participants reviewed 15 SLMs in total. The SLMs all 
related to the three domains of the Triple Aim: Population Health, e.g. life 
expectancy at birth; Patient Experience of Care, e.g. rate of adverse events; 
and Cost and Productivity, e.g. healthcare expenditure per capita.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For a proposed gold standard to be agreed and established 
for each SLM.
RESULTS: Twelve participants took part in Round 1, with 19 participating in 
Round 2. The process established agreement on a gold standard for each of the 15 
reviewed SLMs.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the Delphi consensus process can be used to 
establish gold standards for a suite of SLMs used by a NZ Health Board (CM 
Health).

INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell trait (SCT), the heterozygous carrier state for 
hemoglobin S, is present in an estimated 1.6% of all newborns and 7.3% in black 
individuals in the USA. SCT has long been considered a benign condition with 
anticipated normal life expectancy and no increased risk for chronic diseases. 
The medical literature is inconclusive on the potential association between SCT 
and chronic medical conditions (CMC) including chronic kidney disease, venous 
thromboembolism, and stroke. Studies addressing these questions are lacking 
particularly in non-Black young adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among U.S. 
active duty, enlisted, service members who entered from 1992 to 2012 using 
existing Department of Defense (DoD Military Healthcare System databases). SCT 
positive subjects (1,323) were matched by demographic characteristics to SCT 
negative subjects (3,136) and followed through 2013 for CMC that included deep 
vein thrombosis, diabetes mellitus and hematologic, pulmonary, and renal 
conditions.
RESULTS: The rate of developing any of the included CMC was higher for those 
with SCT (incidence rate ratio = 1.71 95% CI 1.61-1.81) compared with those who 
were SCT negative and their healthcare utilization rate for any of CMC studied 
was higher for SCT positive compared with negative individuals (URR = 2.45 95% 
CI 2.41-2.50), with the highest rate ratios observed for hematologic and renal 
conditions. SCT positive compared with negative individuals were more likely to 
have encounter diagnoses of sickle cell disease and diabetes Type II and were 
less likely to have encounter diagnoses of other hemoglobinopathies and diabetes 
type I.
CONCLUSION: SCT in these racially diverse, young adults increased both the 
incidence of and healthcare utilization for thromboembolism, diabetes mellitus 
type II, sickle cell disease, pulmonary, and chronic renal conditions. These 
findings suggest that clinicians treating young adults with SCT should exercise 
heightened surveillance for these CMC to ensure both early diagnosis and access 
to treatments.

BACKGROUND: Volanesorsen, an investigational inhibitor of apoC-III synthesis, 
significantly reduced triglyceride levels in clinical trials in patients with 
familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder characterized 
by marked chylomicronemia leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including recurrent 
abdominal pain and episodes of potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of volanesorsen on burden of disease on 
patients with FCS Methods: ReFOCUS was a retrospective global web-based survey 
open to patients with FCS who received volanesorsen for ≥3 months in an 
open-label extension study. The survey included questions about patients' 
experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment.
RESULTS: Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of 
222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient 
across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from 
baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry 
about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved 
overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school 
responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal, social, 
and professional life were also reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with volanesorsen has the potential to reduce disease 
burden in patients with FCS through modulation of multiple symptom domains.

Three Lymphadenectomy Strategies in Low-Risk Endometrial Carcinoma: A 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Medicine, and the Department of Health Services Research, the University of 
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; and the Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of three lymphadenectomy strategies in 
the management of low-risk endometrial carcinoma.
METHODS: A decision analysis model compared three lymphadenectomy strategies in 
women undergoing minimally invasive surgery for low-risk endometrial carcinoma: 
1) routine lymphadenectomy in all patients, 2) selective lymphadenectomy based 
on intraoperative frozen section criteria, and 3) sentinel lymph node mapping. 
Costs and outcomes were obtained from published literature and Medicare 
reimbursement rates. Costs categories consisted of hospital, physician, 
operating room, pathology, and lymphedema treatment. Effectiveness was defined 
as 3-year disease-specific survival adjusted for the effect of lymphedema 
(utility=0.8) on quality of life. A cost-utility analysis was performed 
comparing the different strategies. Multiple deterministic sensitivity analyses 
were done.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, routine lymphadenectomy had a cost of 
$18,041 and an effectiveness of 2.79 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Selective lymphadenectomy had a cost of $17,036 and an effectiveness of 2.81 
QALYs, whereas sentinel lymph node mapping had a cost of $16,401 and an 
effectiveness of 2.87 QALYs. With a difference of $1,005 and 0.02 QALYs, 
selective lymphadenectomy was both less costly and more effective than routine 
lymphadenectomy, dominating it. However, with the lowest cost and highest 
effectiveness, sentinel lymph node mapping dominated the other modalities and 
was the most cost-effective strategy. These findings were robust to multiple 
sensitivity analyses varying the rates of lymphedema and lymphadenectomy, 
surgical approach (open or minimally invasive surgery), lymphedema utility, and 
costs. For the estimated 40,000 women undergoing surgery for low-risk 
endometrial carcinoma each year in the United States, the annual cost of routine 
lymphadenectomy, selective lymphadenectomy, and sentinel lymph node mapping 
would be $722 million, $681 million, and $656 million, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared with routine and selective lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph 
node mapping had the lowest costs and highest quality-adjusted survival, making 
it the most cost-effective strategy in the management of low-risk endometrial 
carcinoma.

Diabetes currently affects more than 400 million people worldwide. This 
metabolic disorder causes various micro- and macrovascular complications that 
accelerate atherosclerosis and yet trigger other cardiovascular diseases. The 
characteristic frame of hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia in 
diabetes increases several inflammatory mediators leading to endothelial 
dysfunction and pro-atherosclerotic processes. This MiniReview summarizes 
evidence that antidiabetic drugs have effects beyond lowering glycaemic levels. 
In experimental studies, antidiabetic drugs reduce the vascular production and 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the recruitment, infiltration and 
activation of immune cells and pro-inflammatory mediators, thus decreasing 
vascular inflammatory responses; they also re-establish vascular redox 
homeostasis by reducing oxidative stress and balancing the release of 
vasoconstrictor and vasodilator factors, hence contributing to the improvement 
of endothelial function. These effects are associated with a reduction in 
vascular remodelling due to decreased matrix metalloproteinases 
expression/activity, reduced inflammatory processes and vascular wall fibrosis. 
In clinical studies, antidiabetic drugs also reduce the production and release 
of pro-inflammatory, pro-atherosclerotic and pro-oxidative mediators and improve 
flow-mediated dilatation, indicating beneficial effects on endothelial function. 
These bonus effects of antidiabetic drugs may delay and/or reduce the 
installation and development of the atherosclerotic disease, decrease 
cardiovascular risk and possibly impact mortality risk, life expectancy and 
quality.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported an increased mortality risk from heat 
waves comparing with non-heat wave days. However, how much the mortality rate 
change with the heat intensity-vulnerability curve-is still unknown. Such 
unknown information makes the related managers impossible to assess 
scientifically life losses from heat waves, consequently fail in conducting 
suitable integrated risk management measures.
METHODS: We used the heat wave intensity index (HWII) to characterize 
quantitatively the heat waves, then applied a distributed lag non-linear model 
to explore the area-specific definition of heat wave, and developed the 
vulnerability models on the relationships between HWII and mortality by age and 
by area. Finally, Monte Carlo method was run to assess and compare the 
event-based probabilistic heat wave risk during the periods of 1971-2015 and 
2051-2095.
RESULTS: We found a localized definition of heat wave for each corresponding 
area based on the minimum AIC (Akaike information criterion). Under the local 
heat wave events, the expected life loss during 1971-2015 does distinguish 
across areas, and decreases consistently in the order of WZ Chongqing, PK 
Nanjing and YX Guangzhou for each age group. More specifically, for the elders 
(≥65), the average annual loss (AAL) (and 95% confidence interval) would be 61.3 
(30.6-91.9), 38 (3.8-72.2) and 18.7 (7.3-30) deaths per million people. With two 
stresses from warming and aging in future China, the predicted average AAL of 
the elders under four Representative Carbon Pathways (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) 
during 2051-2095 would be 2460, 1675, 465 deaths per million for PK Nanjing, YX 
Guangzhou and WZ Chongqing, respectively, approximately becoming 8~ 90 times of 
the AAL during 1971-2015.
CONCLUSION: This study found that the non-linear HWII-mortality relationships 
vary by age and area. The heat wave mortality losses are closely associated with 
the social-economic level. With the increasing extreme climatic events and a 
rapid aging trend in China, our findings can provide guidance for policy-makers 
to take appropriate regional adaptive measures to reduce health risks in China.

OBJECTIVE: Homelessness is a critical public health issue and socioeconomic 
epidemic associated with a disproportionate burden of disease and significant 
decrease in life expectancy. We compared emergency care utilization between 
individuals with documented homelessness to those enrolled in Medicaid without 
documented homelessness.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study consisting of electronic 
medical record review of demographics, chief complaints, and health care 
utilization metrics of adults with homelessness compared to a group enrolled in 
Medicaid without identified homelessness. The chart review spanned two years of 
emergency visits at a single urban, academic, tertiary care medical center. 
Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analyses were utilized.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 986 patients experiencing homelessness accounted 
for 7532 ED visits, with a mean of 7.6 (SD 19.9) and max of 316 visits. The 
control group of 3482 Medicaid patients had 5477 ED visits, with a mean of 1.6 
visits (SD 2.1) and max of 49 visits. When controlling for age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, and ESI, those living with homelessness were 7.65 times more likely 
to return to the ED within 30 days of their previous visit, 9.97 times more 
likely to return within 6 months, 10.63 times more likely to return within one 
year, and 11 times more likely to return within 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-homeless Medicaid patients, patients with 
documented homelessness were over seven times more likely to return to the ED 
within 30 days and over eleven times more likely to return to the ED in two 
years.

Photosystem II complex embedded in thylakoid membrane performs oxygenic 
photosynthesis where the reaction center D1/D2 heterodimer accommodates all 
components of the electron transport chain. To express thermostable D1/D2 
heterodimer in a cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, we constructed 
a series of mutant strains whose psbA1 and psbD1 genes encoding, respectively, 
the most highly expressed D1 and D2 polypeptides were replaced with those of a 
thermophilic strain, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. Because the C-terminal 16 
amino acid sequences of D1 polypeptides should be processed prior to maturation 
but diverge from each other, we also constructed the psbA1ΔC-replaced strain 
expressing a thermostable D1 polypeptide devoid of the C-terminal extension. The 
psbA1/psbD1-replaced strain showed decreased growth rate and oxygen evolution 
rate, suggesting inefficient photosystem II. Immunoblot analyses for 
thermostable D1, D2 polypeptides revealed that the heterologous D1 protein was 
absent in thylakoid membrane from any mutant strains with psbA1, psbA1ΔC, and 
psbA1/psbD1-replacements, whereas the heterologous D2 protein was present in 
thylakoid membrane as well as purified photosystem II complex from the 
psbA1/psbD1-replaced strain. In the latter strain, the compensatory expression 
of psbA3 and psbD2 genes was elevated. These data suggest that heterologous D2 
polypeptide could be combined with the host D1 polypeptide to form chimeric 
D1/D2 heterodimer, whereas heterologous D1 polypeptide even without the 
C-terminal extension was unable to make complex with the host D2 polypeptide. 
Since the heterologous D1 could not be detected even in the whole cells of 
psbA1/psbD1-replaced strain, the rapid degradation of unprocessed or unassembled 
heterologous D1 was implicated.

Cycloxaprid is a novel cis-configuration neonicotinoid insecticide that is 
effective against a wide range of insect pests, including those that are 
resistant to conventional neonicotinoids. In this study, life table parameters 
were applied to estimate the cycloxaprid-induced sublethal effects on Aphis 
gossypii. The results indicated that the LC20 (0.81 mg a.i. L-1) of cycloxaprid 
significantly decreased the pre-oviposition period in first-progeny adults. 
Additionally, the life expectancy of F1 generation adults was reduced. However, 
no significant differences were observed for the intrinsic rate of increase (r i 
), finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rate (R0), or mean generation 
time (T) of F1 individuals. Therefore, resurgence in the A. gossypii population 
induced by a low concentration of cycloxaprid might not occur. Additionally, the 
response of the detoxification enzymes showed that cycloxaprid at the LC20 
inhibited cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) and glutathione S-transferase 
(GST) activities at 6 h after exposure. Such inhibition of P450 and GST 
activities could lead to a decrease in the metabolism of cycloxaprid, which 
would increase the efficacy of cycloxaprid. Therefore, our results contribute to 
the assessment of the overall effects of cycloxaprid on A. gossypii.

Pomegranates (cv. 'Bhagwa') packed in four semi-permeable films (Cryovac® 
BDF-2001, D-955, RD-106 and normal LDPE) were stored at ambient temperature 
(25-30 °C, 60-70% RH) and low temperature (8 °C, 80-85% RH) to study the effect 
of modified atmosphere (MA) packaging on storage life extension and quality 
maintenance. O2 and CO2 levels generated inside MA packs differed significantly 
with the film type wherein extremely high CO2 (> 70%) and low O2 (1% or less) 
were observed in BDF film during 3 weeks at ambient temperature and 3 months at 
8 °C. Moderate O2 (3-8%) and CO2 (7-11%) were maintained in D-955 film, whereas 
very high O2 (18-20%) and low CO2 (2-4%) were maintained in RD-906 film. 
Significantly low weight loss of 0.73 and 0.52% was observed in MA packed 
(D-955) fruits after 3 weeks at ambient and 3 months at 8 °C respectively 
compared to 19.0 and 17.8% in non-packed fruits. Fruits packed in D-955 film 
also retained original peel colour (L*, h° and C*), whereas colour was adversely 
affected in fruits packed in low permeable BDF film. MA packaging maintained 
peel thickness and peel moisture, significantly higher than non-packed fruits at 
both temperatures. TSS, acidity, sugars, antioxidants and sensory qualities were 
better in D-955 and LDPE packed fruits at both ambient and 8 °C storage, whereas 
quality was adversely affected in BDF film packed fruits. MA packed (D-955 and 
LDPE) fruits had less spoilage up to 3 weeks at ambient (5.5 and 8.3%) and 
3 months at 8 °C (2.8 and 9.7%). Quality got deteriorated by 4 weeks at ambient 
temperature and 4 months at 8 °C with enhanced spoilage. Pomegranate fruits cv. 
'Bhagwa' can thus be stored safely for 3 weeks at ambient and 3 months at 8 °C 
storage by MA packaging in D-955 or LDPE film with least weight loss and 
maintenance of nutritional quality.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation is a common occurrence, but diagnosis 
can be missed if patients do not complain. Delayed presentation complicates the 
management of a straightforward reduction. We present a case of a 24-year-old 
man who had bilateral TMJ dislocation of unknown duration after motor vehicle 
accident. The accident left him bedridden with speech difficulty. He was totally 
dependent on Ryles' and percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy tubes for feeding. 
Computed tomography revealed dislocation of condyles anterior to articular 
eminences. The bilateral TMJ dislocations were reduced surgically via bicoronal 
with preauricular extension approaches. However, the surgery was challenging due 
to tissue changes around the joint accompanied by masticatory muscles atrophy. 
Postoperatively, he was placed on intermaxillary fixation for 2 weeks followed 
by elastics training. Three months later, the patient's mastication returned 
completely to function. Delayed management of bilateral TMJ dislocation is 
undoubtedly challenging and somewhat frustrating; nevertheless, we manage to 
achieve satisfactory outcome in improving the patient's quality of life.

Heart failure is a growing problem in sub-Saharan Africa. This arises as the 
prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease rises, life expectancy 
increases and causes of heart failure more common in Africa, such as rheumatic 
heart disease and endomyocardial fibrosis, continue to be a significant issue. 
Lack of access to diagnostics is an issue with the expense and technical 
expertise required for echocardiography limiting access. Biomarker strategies 
may play a role here. Access to essential medicines is also limited and requires 
a renewed focus by the international community to ensure that appropriate 
medications are readily available, similar to that which has been implemented 
for HIV and malaria.

countries.

BACKGROUND: Bone metastases (BMs) are common in patients with breast cancer and 
can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs), which are associated with increased 
pain and reduced quality of life (QoL). Bone-targeted agents (BTAs), like 
zoledronic acid and denosumab, reduce the incidence of SREs and delay 
progression of bone pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the management of BMs and pain in six 
European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK) using the 
Adelphi Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme, which included a physician 
survey and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the impact of BMs on pain 
and QoL.
RESULTS: 301 physicians completed patient record forms for 2984 patients with 
advanced breast cancer; 1408 with BMs and 1136 with metastases at sites other 
than bone (non-BMs). Most patients with BMs (88%) received a BTA, with 81% 
receiving treatment during 3 months following BM diagnosis. For those who did 
not receive a BTA, the main reasons given were: very recent BM diagnosis, 
perceived low risk of bone complications, and short life expectancy. Most 
patients with BMs (68%) were experiencing bone pain and, of these, 97% were 
taking analgesics (including 28% receiving strong opioids). Despite this, 
moderate to severe pain was reported in 20% of patients who were experiencing 
pain. PROs were assessed in 766 patients with advanced breast cancer (392 with 
BMs, 374 with non-BMs). Overall, patients with BMs reported worse pain and QoL 
outcomes than those with non-BMs, those not receiving a BTA reported worse pain.
CONCLUSION: Despite the large proportion of patients receiving BTAs in this 
study, some patients with BMs are still not receiving early treatment to prevent 
SREs or to manage pain. Improving physicians' understanding of the role of BTAs 
and the importance of early treatment following BM diagnosis has the potential 
to improve patient care.

Recent studies found evidence of health selective migration whereby healthy 
people move to less deprived areas and less healthy people move to or stay in 
more deprived areas. There is no consensus, however, on whether this influences 
health inequalities. Measures of socio-economic inequalities in mortality and 
life expectancy are widely used by government and health services to track 
changes over time but do not consider the effect of migration. This study aims 
to investigate whether and to what extent migration altered the observed 
socioeconomic gradient in mortality. Data for the population of Wales 
(3,136,881) registered with the National Health Service on 01/01/2006 and 
follow-up for 24 quarters were individually record-linked to ONS mortality 
files. This included moves between lower super output areas (LSOAs), deprivation 
quintiles and rural-urban class at each quarter, age, sex, and date of death. 
Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios for the 
deprivation quintiles in all-cause mortality, as well as deprivation change 
between the start and end of the study. We found evidence of health selective 
migration in some groups, for example people aged under 75 leaving the most 
deprived areas having a higher mortality risk than those they left behind, 
suggesting widening inequalities, but also found the opposite pattern for other 
migration groups. For all ages, those who lived in the most deprived quintile 
had a 57% higher risk of death than those in the least deprived quintile, 
allowing deprivation to vary with moves over time. There was little change in 
this risk when people were artificially kept in their deprivation quintile of 
origin (54% higher). Overall, migration during the six year window did not 
substantially alter the deprivation gradient in mortality in Wales between 2006 
and 2011.

A quantitative trait locus (QTL) gw8.1 was detected in the population derived 
from a cross between the elite japonica cultivar, 'Hwaseong' and Oryza rufipogon 
(IRGC 105491). Near isogenic lines (NILs) harboring the O. rufipogon segment on 
chromosome 8 showed increased grain length and weight compared to those of the 
recurrent parent, Hwaseong. This QTL was mapped to a 175.3-kb region containing 
28 genes, of which four were considered as candidates based on the presence of 
mutations in their coding regions and as per the RNA expression pattern during 
the inflorescence stage. Leaves and panicles obtained from plants harvested 5 
days after heading showed differences in gene expression between Hwaseong and 
gw8.1-NILs. Most genes were upregulated in O. rufipogon and gw8.1-NIL than in 
Hwaseong. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the lemma inner epidermal 
cells indicated that cell length was higher in gw8.1 NIL than in Hwaseong, 
indicating that gw8.1 might regulate cell elongation. Among the candidate genes, 
LOC_Os08g34380 encoding a putative receptor-like kinase and LOC_Os08g34550 
encoding putative RING-H2 finger protein were considered as possible candidates 
based on their functional similarity.

CONTEXT:   Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common injury that interferes with 
quality of life and physical activity. Clinical subgroups of patients may exist, 
one of which is caused by proximal muscle dysfunction.
OBJECTIVES:   To develop clinical prediction rules that predict a positive 
outcome after either a hip and core- or knee-focused strengthening program for 
individuals with PFP.
DESIGN:   Secondary analysis of data from a randomized control trial.
SETTING:   Four university laboratories.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:   A total of 199 participants with PFP.
INTERVENTION(S):   Participants were randomly allocated to either a hip and 
core-focused (n = 111) or knee-focused (n = 88) rehabilitation group for a 
6-week program.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):   Demographics, self-reported knee pain (visual analog 
scale) and function (Anterior Knee Pain Scale), hip strength, abdominal muscle 
endurance, and hip range of motion were evaluated at baseline. Treatment success 
was defined as a decrease in visual analog scale score by ≥2 cm or an increase 
in the Anterior Knee Pain Scale score by ≥8 points or both. Bivariate 
relationships between the outcome (treatment success) and the predictor 
variables were explored, followed by a forward stepwise logistic regression to 
predict a successful outcome.
RESULTS:   Patients with more pain, better function, greater lateral core 
endurance, and less anterior core endurance were more likely to have a 
successful outcome after hip and core strengthening (88% sensitivity and 54% 
specificity). Patients with lower weight, weaker hip internal rotation, stronger 
hip extension, and greater trunk-extension endurance were more likely to have 
success after knee strengthening (82% sensitivity and 58% specificity).
CONCLUSION:   The patients with PFP who have more baseline pain and yet maintain 
a high level of function may experience additional benefit from hip and core 
strengthening. The clinical prediction rules from this study remain in the 
developmental phase and should be applied with caution until externally 
validated.

In relation to the Swedish ethical platform for priority setting in health-care 
it is debated what role cost-effectiveness should play. In the article an 
ethical analysis is presented showing that a limited role risks leading to 
unequal priorities between similar needs in conflict with the human dignity and 
need-solidarity principles of the platform. It is also argued that resulting 
problems with effect comparability over different conditions and resulting 
equality problems with the current praxis can be mitigated through strategies 
like explicitly considering outcome measure and by adjusting the 
cost-effectiveness threshold under specific conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Discontinuation of dopamine agonist (DA) treatment in women with 
prolactinoma after menopause is a potential approach; studies systematically 
assessing long-term outcomes are lacking. Our aim was to investigate the natural 
history of prolactinoma in this group.
DESIGN/PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of women with prolactinoma diagnosed 
before menopause and who after menopause were not on DA.
RESULTS: Thirty women were included. Twenty-eight received DA (median duration 
18 years, median age at DA withdrawal 52 years). At last assessment (median 
follow-up 3 years) and compared with values 6-12 months after stopping DA, 
Prolactin (PRL) increased in 15%, decreased but not normalized in 33% and was 
normal in 52%; PRL levels or visible adenoma on imaging before DA withdrawal, 
treatment duration and presence of macro-/microadenoma at diagnosis were not 
predictors of normoprolactinaemia at last review, whereas PRL values 6-12 months 
after stopping DA were. Adenoma regrowth was detected in 2/27 patients (7%), who 
showed gradual increase in PRL. Comparison with 28 women who had DA withdrawal 
before their menopause revealed lower risk of hyperprolactinaemia recurrence in 
the postmenopausal group (HR:0.316, 95% CI: 0.101-0.985, P < .05). Two women
