Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) frequently affects patients 
after treatments with bisphosphonates or denosumab, especially with high doses 
in patients with bone osteoporosis, neoplastic metastases, or possibly 
anti-angiogenic treatment for cancer. The aim of this article was to show a new 
treatment planning for stage 2 and stage 3 MRONJ using platelet-rich fibrin 
(PRF) at the surgical field to enhance healing in association with a new 
epi-mucosal fixation technique to prevent or treat mandibular fracture. Two 
cases were treated by epi-mucosa fixation and autologous PRF use for prevention 
of mandibular fracture risks related to necrotic bone resection or a narrow 
fracture reduction. Both cases were successfully treated by this new technique 
of epi-mucosa fixation combined with autologous PRF and achieved good results 
and good quality of life. Ability to wear prosthesis with good mastication in 
the absence of side effect such as infection, plate and screw mobilization, 
pain, and other disabilities or extension of necrosis was reported. After 
surgical removal of necrotic bone, no infection was detected without any 
extension of the necrosis.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing along with the rising prevalence of 
cognitive disorders. Among the factors that may contribute to their prevalence, 
modifiable risk factors such as diet may be of primary importance. Unarguably, 
plant-based diets rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, showed their 
potential in decreasing risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the aim 
of the present study is to investigate whether exposure to components of 
plant-based diets, namely phenolic acids, may affect cognitive status in older 
Italian adults.
METHODS: The demographic, lifestyle and dietary habits of a sample of 
individuals living in southern Italy were analyzed. Dietary intake was assessed 
through food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Data on the phenolic acids content 
in foods were estimated using the Phenol-Explorer database. Cognitive status was 
evaluated using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations.
RESULTS: The mean intake of phenolic acids was 346.6 mg/d. After adjustment for 
potential confounding factors, individuals in the highest quartile of total 
phenolic acid intake were less likely to have impaired cognitive status (OR = 
0.36 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.92)); similarly, the analysis for subclasses of phenolic 
acids showed the beneficial effect toward cognitive status of greater intake of 
hydroxycinnamic acids (OR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.91)). Among individual 
compounds, only higher intake of caffeic acid was inversely associated with 
impaired cognitive status (OR = 0.32 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.93)); notably, the 
association with ferulic acid intake was significant only when adjusting for 
background characteristics, and not for adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that greater intakes of dietary phenolic acids 
were significantly inversely associated with impaired cognition, emphasizing the 
possible role of phenolic acids in the prevention of cognitive disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Recent modifications in the epidemiology of oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (OSCC) have led to the increase of Human papillomavirus (HPV) 
related metastatic head and neck cancer patients with high life expectancy even 
at advanced stage, low comorbidity and still restricted systemic therapy 
opportunities. In the recent era of ablative therapies' development, 
oligometastatic HPV OSCC patients are indubitably good candidates for 
intensified treatment. However, data related to outcomes after optimised 
management of metastatic sites are dramatically missing.
MATERIALS AND PATIENTS: In our cohort of 186 unselected consecutive OSCC 
patients treated with curative intent at our institution between 2009 and 2013, 
we analysed the incidence, treatment and outcomes of distant metastatic (DM) 
failure according to p16 status.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.2 years (95% CI: 3.8-4.4) from primary 
diagnosis of OSCC, 21/95 p16- patients (22.1%) vs. 8/91 (8.8%) p16+ patients 
presented DM failure with a median interval of 11 (range 0-46) and 28 months 
(range 0-71), respectively (p = 0.10). Overall survival (OS) after DM failure 
was significantly higher in p16+ patients with a two-year OS rate of 75% and 15% 
for p16+ and p16-, respectively (p = 0.002). In eight HPV-related metastatic 
patients, three underwent ablative lung metastasis treatment and are still 
complete responders four to five years later.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights distinct outcomes of metastatic HPV-related 
OSCC patients emphasised by three long-term complete responders after lung 
ablative treatment. In patients with high life expectancy and limited tumour 
burden, the question of ablative treatment such as metastasectomy or 
stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) should be addressed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: most acute pancreatitis cases are of biliary origin 
and cholecystectomy is recommended to prevent recurrence. However, some patients 
will never be referred for surgery. In this study, the long-term follow-up of 
this group of patients was reviewed.
METHODS: all new cases of biliary pancreatitis from January 2015 to December 
2017 that did not undergo cholecystectomy were analyzed. Epidemiologic data and 
Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI) were recorded. Recurrent episodes of 
pancreatitis or biliary events and mortality during the follow-up period were 
recorded.
RESULTS: a total of 104 patients were included in the study (30.4 % of all 
biliary pancreatitis cases) and the median age was 82 years (range, 27-96). 
Average CCI was 5 (range, 0-18) and the median follow-up period was 37 months 
(range, 1-70). A total of 41 patients (39.4 %) had gallstone-related 
complications. Twenty-three patients (22,1 %) had recurrent pancreatitis and 34 
(32,7 %) developed biliary events. Twenty-five patients died during follow-up 
(24 %) but only in 6 (5,8 %) was death due to gallstone-related complications. 
Non-related mortality was 15.5 % in patients who refused surgery and 25 % in 
multiple-comorbidity patients.
CONCLUSION: patients who did not undergo cholecystectomy were at high risk for 
biliary events and pancreatitis recurrence. Conservative treatment and surgical 
abstention should be individualized and reserved for patients with multiple 
comorbidities with a short life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Terminal illness can cause a financial burden for many households. 
In England and Wales, fast-track access to welfare payments is available through 
special rules for the terminally ill (SRTI). Individuals are eligible for SRTI 
if they are judged to have 6 months or less to live. This criterion has been 
criticised as lacking a clinical basis, and being unfair for people with 
conditions where life-expectancy is difficult to accurately assess.
AIM: To conduct a budget impact analysis on the possible increase in expenditure 
of personal independence payments (PIP) following a change in England and Wales 
to SRTI so that everyone with a terminal illness is eligible.
METHODS: The fraction of individuals with a given long-term condition was 
estimated by combining data from the Health Survey for England, the Office for 
National Statistics (ONS) and the Department for Work and Pensions. Logistic 
growth modelling and ONS population projections were used to project PIP 
expenditure from 2020 to 2025. The increased expenditure was calculated for 
hypothetical scenarios which may occur following an SRTI regime change, 
specifically an increase of 1, 2 and 3 percentage points in the fraction of 
individuals claiming PIP under SRTI. Data from the literature on the projected 
prevalence of mild, moderate and severe dementia was used to calculate the cost 
if everyone with a given severity of dementia claimed PIP under SRTI.
RESULTS: Under the current SRTI regime, PIP expenditure under SRTI was projected 
to increase from £0.231bn in 2020 to £0.260bn in 2025, compared to equivalent 
figures of £11.1bn and £12.7bn under non-SRTI. Expenditure in 2025 following an 
increase in the fraction claiming of 1, 2 and 3 percentage points was projected 
to be £1.1bn, £1.9bn and £2.7bn respectively. In 2025, PIP expenditure was 
estimated to be £7.4bn if everyone with dementia claimed under SRTI, compared to 
£6.4bn if only individuals with moderate and severe dementia claimed, and £4.7bn 
if only individuals with severe dementia claimed.
CONCLUSION: Changes in SRTI are projected to lead to increases in PIP 
expenditure. However, the increased cost is small compared to expenditure under 
non-SRTI, especially as the highest costs were associated with extreme 
scenarios.

BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma (UM) represents the most common primary intra-ocular 
malignancy in adults. Up to 50% of the patients develop distant metastases 
within 10 years from diagnosis, with the liver as the most common site. Upon 
metastatization, life expectancy strongly reduces and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors that prove effective in cutaneous melanoma do not modify clinical 
outcome. To date, few studies have focused on deciphering the immunomodulatory 
features of metastatic UM microenvironment, and there are no prognostic models 
for clinical use. This highlights the urgent need to understand the delicate 
interplay between tumor and immune cells acting at the site of metastasis.
METHODS: We collected a patient cohort comprising 21 metastatic UM patients. 
Hepatic and extra-hepatic UM metastasis samples were studied by multiplex 
immunofluorescence to assess the tumor immune cell composition. Quantitative 
analyses were performed to correlate immune cell densities with treatment 
response, metastasis site and patient survival.
RESULTS: Compared to patients with progressive disease, those with controlled 
disease had a higher intra-tumoral/peritumoral ratio of CD8 + Granzyme B+ cells, 
higher density of intra-tumoral CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and an 
increased percentage of UM cells in close proximity to T lymphocytes, reflecting 
a role of tumor-killing T cells in the disease. In liver metastases (LM), the 
intra-tumoral densities of CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and of 
total CD8+ T cells were higher than in extra-hepatic UM metastases, but the 
percentage of Granzyme B+ CTL was lower. Moreover, LM displayed more UM cells 
adjacent to both CTL and TAM, and also more T cells in proximity to TAM, all 
signs of an impaired immune response. The percentage of activated CTL within the 
tumor represented a prognostic indicator, as patients with a higher 
intra-tumoral percentage of CD8 + Granzyme B+ cells had the better outcome. A 
temptative Immunoscore was generated and proved capable to stratify patients 
with improved survival. Finally, CD4 + FoxP3+ T cells appeared a crucial 
population for response to immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study underly the clinical relevance and 
functional importance of composition and localization of antitumor effector 
cells for the progression of UM metastasis.

Standard treatment options in classic HCL (cHCL) result in high response rates 
and near normal life expectancy. However, the disease itself and the recommended 
standard treatment are associated with profound and prolonged immunosuppression, 
increasing susceptibility to infections and the risk for a severe course of 
COVID-19. The Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation (HCLF) has recently convened 
experts and discussed different clinical strategies for the management of these 
patients. The new recommendations adapt the 2017 consensus for the diagnosis and 
management with cHCL to the current COVID-19 pandemic. They underline the option 
of active surveillance in patients with low but stable blood counts, consider 
the use of targeted and non-immunosuppressive agents as first-line treatment for 
cHCL, and give recommendations on preventive measures against COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) frequently resort to osteopathic or 
chiropractic treatment, despite very weak supporting evidence. We aimed to 
assess the efficacy of osteopathic manipulation in FM in a properly controlled 
and powered randomized clinical trial.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to osteopathic or sham treatment. Treatment 
was administered by experienced physical medicine physicians, and consisted of 
six sessions per patient, over 6 weeks. Treatment credibility and expectancy 
were repeatedly evaluated. Patients completed standardized questionnaires at 
baseline, during treatment, and at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after randomization. 
The primary outcome was pain intensity (100-mm visual analog scale) during the 
treatment period. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, functioning, and 
health-related quality of life. We performed primarily intention-to-treat 
analyses adjusted for credibility, using multiple imputation for missing data.
RESULTS: In total, 101 patients (94% women) were included. Osteopathic treatment 
did not significantly decrease pain relative to sham treatment (mean difference 
during treatment: -2.2 mm; 95% confidence interval, -9.1 to 4.6 mm). No 
significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes. No serious adverse 
events were observed, despite a likely rebound in pain and altered functioning 
at week 12 in patients treated by osteopathy. Patient expectancy was predictive 
of pain during treatment, with a decrease of 12.9 mm (4.4-21.5 mm) per 10 points 
on the 0-30 scale. Treatment credibility and expectancy were also predictive of 
several secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Osteopathy conferred no benefit over sham treatment for pain, 
fatigue, functioning, and quality of life in patients with FM. These findings do 
not support the use of osteopathy to treat these patients. More attention should 
be paid to the expectancy of patients in FM management.

Winston-Salem, NC, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition 
characterized by occlusive disease of the pulmonary vasculature. Point-of-care 
ultrasound (POCUS) of right ventricular strain patterns have high specificity 
and low sensitivity for diagnosis. Here, we describe a patient with a saddle PE 
and low pre-test probability who was diagnosed primarily by handheld POCUS.
CASE REPORT: An 80-year old female was admitted to the intensive care unit with 
hypotension and lactic acidosis. She also had mild leukocytosis and 
troponinemia. No other clinical or metabolic abnormalities were present. After 
transfer to the floor, handheld POCUS demonstrated D-sign and McConnell's sign. 
Computed tomography angiography showed a saddle PE involving both main pulmonary 
arteries. The patient was immediately initiated on anticoagulation without 
further complications.
CONCLUSION: Handheld POCUS is inexpensive, carries a low risk of harm and is an 
invaluable extension of the physical exam when interpreted in the appropriate 
context.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate local control and toxicities of 
strongly hypofractionated electron beam radiotherapy (RT) in elderly and fragile 
patients with facial nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients aged ≥ 65 years with facial NMSC, 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 40 and life expectancy ≥ 6 months, amenable 
neither to daily RT nor surgery. Radiotherapy consisted of 35 Gy, delivered with 
6 MeV electron beam, in 5 fractions of 7 Gy/day twice a week (tw). Prescription 
isodoses were 100% for cT1-cT2 and 90% for cT3-cT4. Objective response was 
assessed clinically 4 and 8 weeks after the end of RT and then monitored every 6 
months. Side effects were assessed according to the CTCAE scale.
RESULTS: 12 patients of median age 89.5 years with a total of 23 NMSC cN0 
achieved a median follow-up time of 6 months (range 1-10), with total treatment 
compliance. 10/12 patients had a 40 ≤ KPS < 70 and 2/12 a 70 ≤ KPS < 90. 5/12 
patients had synchronous lesions. 22/23 lesions were classified as T1-T2 and had 
complete response (CR), 1/23 as T4 with partial response (PR). Within 4 weeks 
after the end of treatment, G1 toxicity was reported for 12/23 lesions, G2 for 
8/23, G3 for 3/23, G4 for 0/23, all disappeared 8 weeks later, with or without 
topical therapy. After last follow-up (1 June 2020) 1/12 patients died with PR 
from senile marasmus, 11/12 are alive with CR and widely tolerated toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Extreme hypofractionation of radiotherapy dose for facial NMSC is 
effective, safe and suitable for elderly patients.

Assessing the Mortality Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Florida State 
Prisons.

Marquez NM, Littman A, Rossi V, Everett M, Tyagi E, Johnson H, Dolovich S.

BACKGROUND: The increased risk of COVID-19 infection among incarcerated 
individuals due to environmental hazards is well known and recent studies have 
highlighted the higher rates of infection and mortality prisoners in the United 
States face due to COVID-19. However, the impact of COVID-19 on all-cause 
mortality rates in incarcerated populations has not been studied.
METHODS: Using data reported by the Florida Department of Corrections on prison 
populations and mortality events we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 
all individuals incarcerated in Florida state prisons between 2015 and 2020. We 
calculated excess deaths by estimating age-specific expected deaths from 
mortality trends in 2015 through 2019 and taking the difference between observed 
and expected deaths during the pandemic period. We calculated life table 
measures using standard demographic techniques and assessed significant yearly 
changes using bootstrapping.
FINDINGS: The Florida Department of Corrections reported 510 total deaths from 
March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 among the state prison population. This was 
42% higher (rate ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.89) than the expected number of 
deaths in light of mortality rates for previous years. Reported COVID-19 deaths 
in a month were positively correlated with estimated excess deaths (80.4%, p 
<.01). Using age-specific mortality estimates, we found that life expectancy at 
age 20 declined by 4 years (95% CI 2.06-6.57) between 2019 and 2020 for the 
Florida prison population.
INTERPRETATION: The Florida prison population saw a significant increase in 
all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period, leading to a decrease 
in life expectancy of more than four years. Life years lost by the Florida 
prison population were likely far greater than those lost by the general United 
States population, as reported by other studies. This difference in years lost 
highlights the need for increased interventions to protect vulnerable 
incarcerated populations during pandemics.

Learning and memory are major cognitive processes strongly tied to the life 
histories of animals. In ants, chemotactile information generally plays a 
central role in social interaction, navigation and resource exploitation. 
However, in hunters, visual information should take special relevance during 
foraging, thus leading to differential use of information from different sensory 
modalities. Here, we aimed to test whether a hunter, the neotropical ant 
Ectatomma ruidum, differentially learns stimuli acquired through multiple 
sensory channels. We evaluated the performance of E. ruidum workers when trained 
using olfactory, mechanical, chemotactile and visual stimuli under a restrained 
protocol of appetitive learning. Conditioning of the maxilla labium extension 
response enabled control of the stimuli provided. Our results show that ants 
learn faster and remember for longer when trained using chemotactile or visual 
stimuli than when trained using olfactory and mechanical stimuli separately. 
These results agree with the life history of E. ruidum, characterized by a high 
relevance of chemotactile information acquired through antennation as well as 
the role of vision during hunting.

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, highly aggressive 
and deadly disease with a poor patient life expectancy. A few years ago, the 
main challenge was the histological diagnosis of this disease; at present, the 
search for the best therapeutic strategy is now a priority. However, an optimal 
therapeutic strategy is not yet clear, despite growing efforts in the treatment 
armamentarium and research, and at the era of tailored and individualized 
treatment, tools to predict patient survival are needed for therapeutic 
decision-making. Among them, the LENT scoring system was developed to predict 
prognosis in patients with malignant pleural effusion. The aim of this study was 
to assess the performance of the LENT score in predicting prognosis in patients 
with MPM.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted by analyzing the 
prospective collected databases of patients undergoing medical thoracoscopy in a 
single center with a final diagnosis of MPM confirmed by the MESOPATH National 
Reference Center.
RESULTS: A total of 41 patients with MPM were studied. All patients underwent 
platinum-based chemotherapy combined with pemetrexed ± bevacizumab. No high-risk 
category patients were found using the LENT scoring system in this cohort. The 
median (range) LENT score at the time of medical thoracoscopy was 0 (0-3) and 
the median survival was 15.5 (2-54) months for the entire cohort. The median 
survival of low-risk and moderate-risk category patients was 21.4 months (2-54, 
32 patients) and 6.7 months (2-19, nine patients), respectively. A total of 27 
patients with MPM of epithelial subgroup had a median LENT score of 1 (0-2) with 
a 26 (2-54) months median survival. The median LENT score and median survival of 
nonepithelial mesothelioma patients (biphasic MPM subgroup, eight patients; 
sarcomatoid MPM subgroup, six patients) were 0 (0-3) and 11 (2-52) months, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Applied to a homogenous cohort of MPM patients, the LENT score 
underestimated prognosis and was not useful per se for the management of this 
disease, as evidenced in the epithelial mesothelioma subgroup of patients in our 
study.

Vertebral fractures (VF) related to osteoporosis (i.e., severe OP) increase the 
risk of disability and mortality, but they are often neglected. We observed a 
severe OP misdiagnosis in 28.9% of inpatients with previous spinal imaging 
positive for VFs. Diagnosing severe OP is crucial to reduce the health care 
costs of inpatients.
INTRODUCTION: Vertebral fractures (VFs) related to osteoporosis (OP) increase 
the risk of additional fractures and death. In inpatients, VFs are often 
neglected with consequent delay in OP treatments, prolongation of 
hospitalization, and reduction of life expectancy. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the prevalence of a misdiagnosed severe OP (i.e., with VF) in general 
medicine inpatients.
METHODS: We evaluated inpatients of a Medicine Unit between January 2019 and 
December 2019 without severe OP diagnosis, who had spinal imaging. For each 
patient, we collected demographic data, previous or current OP treatment, and 
presence/number of VFs. Descriptive data were presented by medians 
(interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous data or as numbers (percentages) for 
categorical data. Differences between subgroups were analyzed with chi-square or 
Kruskal-Wallis tests as appropriate. p-values <0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: 793 subjects were admitted to inpatient's clinic: 235 (135 females and 
100 males with a median age of 76.0 [64.0-83.0] years) were enrolled. One or 
more vertebral fractures were present in 28.9% (68/235) subjects; 47% (32/68) 
had two or more vertebral fractures. The majority of patients (55/68) with VFs 
had not previously received a severe OP diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe OP was misdiagnosed in at least 8.6% of inpatients. The 
prevalence dramatically increases (about 29%) in subjects with previous spinal 
imaging showing one or more VFs. More attention should be given to this 
co-morbidity, which is known to be an additional risk factor for disability and 
mortality.

Chromosomal aberrations are generally considered to have a remarkable impact on 
the outcome of multiple myeloma. Bortezomib helps to achieve complete responses 
and leads to longer life expectancy in many multiple myeloma patients. This 
study was designed to clarify whether bortezomib can improve the poor prognosis 
resulting from del(17q13), del(13q14), amp(1q21), t(4,14), t(14,16) in patients 
with multiple myeloma. A total of 255 MM patients treated with bortezomib-based 
regimens were included in this study. All chromosomal aberrations were detected 
by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Kaplan-Meier survival and 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis were employed to assess the prognostic 
situation in progression-free survival and overall survival. The result showed 
that the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with 
del(17q13) were shorter than those without del(17q13) in multivariate analysis 
and patients with del(13q14), amp(1q21), t(4,14), t(14,16) were similar to 
patients without these chromosomal aberrations in progression-free survival and 
overall survival after receiving bortezomib-based regimens.In conclusion 
Bortezomib-based regimens can overcome the poor prognosis derived from 
del(13q14), amp(1q21), t(4,14), t(14,16) but not del(17q13).

Advances in the treatment of congenital heart disease (CHD) have increased life 
expectancy, entailing medical surveillance for a considerable number of 
adolescents and young adults with CHD for issues arising in areas such as sexual 
health. This study aimed to assess the sexual knowledge and the needs for sexual 
health education among this group. The participants comprised 53 young adult 
outpatients (27 males, median age: 23 years) who had undergone surgical 
interventions (median: 3 times) for CHD. The Knowledge related to Safe Sex 
Practice scale (KSSP), an assessment tool containing 15 questions on sexual 
knowledge, was administered, and the rates of correct answers for each item and 
the overall scale were compared with the age and sex of a control group (n = 
164). The overall mean KSSP score of the participant group (10.5 ± 1.8) was 
significantly lower than that of the control group (11.1 ± 1.9, p = .035). The 
KSSP scores of the participants with low peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO2 < 
95%) were significantly lower (9.77 ± 1.85) than those with normal SaO2 (11.06 ± 
1.85, p = .009). Regarding sexual health education, the participants reported 
receiving information about contraception as more important than other areas of 
sexual health. The rate of incorrect answers was higher for questions regarding 
natural ways of contraception utilizing infertile periods in the menstrual 
cycle. Based on an informed understanding of those with CHD, healthcare 
providers in this field should develop customized sexual health education for 
adolescents and young adults with CHD and implement customized sexual health 
education, including effective contraception methods.

Decisions on interventions or policy alternatives affecting health can be 
informed by economic evaluations, like cost-benefit or cost-utility analyses. In 
this context, there is a need for valid estimates of the monetary equivalent 
value of health (gains), which are often expressed in € per quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Obtaining such estimates remains methodologically 
challenging, with a recent addition to the health economists' toolbox, which is 
based on well-being data: The well-being valuation approach. Using general 
population panel data from Germany, we put this approach to the test by 
investigating several empirical and conceptual challenges, such as the 
appropriate functional specification of income utility, the choice of health 
utility tariffs, or the health state dependence of consumption utility. 
Depending on specification, the bulk of estimated € per QALY values ranged from 
€20,000-60,000, with certain specifications leading to more considerable 
deviations, underlining persistent practical challenges when applying the 
well-being valuation methodology to health and QALYs. Based on our findings, we 
formulate recommendations for future research and applications.
