(clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus aspirin 75-162 mg daily) for 18 months. Clinical 
event rates, direct medical costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
gained were the primary outcomes from the US healthcare provider perspective. 
Base-case results showed DAPT continuation gained higher QALYs (8.1769 vs 8.1582 
QALYs) at lower cost (USD42 982 vs USD44 063). One-way sensitivity analysis 
found that base-case QALYs were sensitive to odds ratio (OR) of cardiovascular 
death with DAPT continuation and base-case cost was sensitive to OR of nonfatal 
stroke with DAPT continuation. DAPT continuation remained cost-effective when 
the ORs of nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular death were below 1.241 and 1.188, 
respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, DAPT continuation was the 
preferred strategy in 74.75% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations at 
willingness-to-pay threshold of 50 000 USD/QALYs. Continuation of DAPT appears 
to be cost-effective in ACS patients who were event-free for 12-month DAPT after 
DES. The cost-effectiveness of DAPT for 30 months was highly subject to the OR 
of nonfatal stroke and OR of death with DAPT continuation.

ENDOCRINE TRAINEES EXHIBIT SENSITIVE BUT CONSERVATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE 
MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE CONDITIONS IN HIV PATIENTS IN SINGAPORE.

Seow CJ, Chen AW, Hoi WH, Dalan R.

OBJECTIVE: With advances in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infections, the life expectancy of people with HIV (PWH) is fast approaching 
that of the general population. Endocrine and metabolic disorders occur more 
frequently in PWH than in the general population. This study assessed the 
knowledge, practice patterns, and confidence levels among endocrinology trainees 
in Singapore in managing endocrine disorders in PWH.
METHODS: An anonymous, 31-item survey was administered to 23 endocrinology 
trainees. Four domains were assessed: (1) previous exposure to endocrine 
disorders in PWH; (2) attitudes towards treating PWH, (3) case studies in 
endocrinology designed to assess for differences in treatment philosophy between 
a PWH and a noninfected counterpart, and (4) confidence in managing endocrine 
disorders in PWH.
RESULTS: The participation rate was 73.9%, with the majority of trainees (88.2%) 
having managed fewer than 5 PWH with endocrine disorders. A total of 94.1% of 
the trainees had little or no hesitation in treating PWH, but more than half 
(58.8%) felt inadequate in confidently managing them. A total of 82.4% deemed 
HIV endocrinology as an emerging field and were open to the idea of pursuing it 
as a subspecialty in the future. Re-assuringly, most trainees would not 
compromise medical treatment for a PWH if it were indicated. More than half were 
ambivalent about prescribing cross-hormonal therapy to transgender individuals.
CONCLUSION: Endocrinology trainees feel that while HIV endocrinology is an 
emerging field, they lack exposure, training, and confidence in the management 
of these patients. Although they would treat medical conditions well, they 
lacked knowledge in hormonal treatment of transgender individuals.

Some promoters were isolated and characterized from the genome of Leuconostoc 
mesenteroides SY2, an isolate from kimchi, a Korean traditional fermented 
vegetable. Chromosomal DNA of L. mesenteroides SY2 was digested with Sau3AI and 
ligated with BamHI-cut pBV5030, a promoter screening vector containing a 
promoterless cat-86. Among E. coli transformants (TFs) resistant against Cm 
(chloramphenicol), 17 were able to grow in the presence of 1,000 μg/ml Cm and 
their inserts were sequenced. Transcription start sites were examined for three 
putative promoters (P04C, P25C, and P33C) by primer extension. Four putative 
promoters were inserted upstream of a promoterless α-amylase reporter gene in 
pJY15α. α-Amylase activities of E. coli TFs containing pJY15α (control, no 
promoter), pJY03α (pJY15α with P03C), pJY04α (with P04C), pJY25α (with P25C), 
and pJY33α (with P33C) were 66.9, 78.7, 122.1, 70.8, and 99.3 U, respectively. 
Cells harboring pJY04α showed 1.8 times higher activity than the control. Some 
promoters characterized in this study might be useful for construction of 
foodgrade expression vectors for Leuconostoc sp. and related lactic acid 
bacteria.

Estimating incidence and prevalence from population registers: example from 
myocardial infarction.

Council, Sweden.

AIM: To illustrate how the fundamental epidemiological measures, incidence rate 
and prevalence proportion, can be estimated based on Swedish population 
registers using acute myocardial infarction (MI) as an example, together with a 
discussion about the analytical decisions.
METHODS: All individuals in Sweden aged 60-89 (born 1904-1954) during the study 
period 1994-2014 were identified through the Total Population Register. Cases of 
MI were defined and identified from information on hospital admissions and 
causes of death. Incidence rates of all, first, and recurrent MI were calculated 
together with prevalence proportions.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of all, first, and recurrent MI declined over the 
study period. While the incidence rates of first MI are lower for women than 
men, the incidence rates of recurrent MI are considerably higher but similar for 
men and women. The prevalence calculated with duration of disease set at 28 days 
also declined. This was despite improved survival from MI and increased life 
expectancy over the same period meaning that the decline in incidence was large 
enough to compensate for increased survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Calculating incidence and prevalence of diseases using population 
registers requires detailed and well-reasoned definitions. The definitions will 
affect both the study population and the number of disease events and it is 
essential that the cases and the study population are defined in a coherent way. 
Different measures of disease occurrence contribute with different aspects of 
the disease panorama and a joint interpretation contributes to a thorough 
understanding of the disease development in a population.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), widely used to treat 
high-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, has recently been 
extended to younger patients at lower operative risk in whom long-term 
durability of TAVI devices is an important concern. Therefore, we conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addressing the 
frequency of structural valve deterioration (SVD) after TAVI.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
and Cochrane CENTRAL from 2002 to September 2016. We included observational 
studies following patients with TAVI for at least 2 years. Independently and in 
duplicate, we evaluated study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of 
bias for SVD post-TAVI. Our review used the GRADE system to assess quality of 
evidence. We pooled incidence rates using a random effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies including 8914 patients, with a median follow-up 
between 1.6 and 5 years, reported an incidence of SVD post-TAVI between 0 to 
1.34 per 100 patient years. The pooled incidence of SVD was 28.08 per 10 000 
patients/year (95% CI 2.46 to 73.44 per 100 patient years). Of those who 
developed SVD, 12% underwent valve re-intervention. Confidence in the evidence 
was moderate due to inconsistency among studies.
CONCLUSION: Structural valve deterioration is probably an infrequent event 
within the first 5 years after TAVI. Ascertaining the impact of SVD and the need 
for valve-related re-interventions to inform recommendations for patients with a 
longer life-expectancy will require studies including a large number of patients 
with longer follow-up (>10 years).

In this study, we first construct an age-stage, two-sex life table for onion 
maggot, Delia antiqua, grown on three host plants: onion, scallion, and garlic. 
We found that onion is the optimal host for this species and populations grown 
on onion have maximum fecundity, longest adult longevity and reproduction 
period, and the shortest immature developmental time. In contrast, the fecundity 
on other hosts was lower, particularly on garlic, but these crops can also serve 
as important secondary hosts for this pest. These data will be useful to the 
growers to develop specific integrated management programs for each of hosts. We 
also compared the demographic analyses of using individually-reared and 
group-reared methods. These two methods provided similar accurate outcomes for 
estimating insect population dynamics for this species. However, for gregarious 
species, using the individually-reared method to construct insect life tables 
produces inaccurate results, and researchers must use group-reared method for 
life table calculations. When studying large groups of insect, group-reared 
demographic analysis for age-stage, two-sex life table can also simplify 
statistical analysis, save considerable labor, and reduce experimental errors.

Mapping the global research landscape and knowledge gaps on multimorbidity: a 
bibliometric study.

Xu X(1), Mishra GD(1), Jones M(1).

Author information:
(1)Centre for Longitudinal and Life Course Research, School of Public Health, 
The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

BACKGROUND: To summarize global research trends and activities on 
multimorbidity; then to assess the knowledge gaps and to identify implications 
for knowledge exchange between high income countries (HICs) and low- and middle- 
income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify research publications 
on multimorbidity in the Web of ScienceTM, as well as diabetes, depression, 
hypertension, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The time frame 
for the search was from 1900 to June, 2016. Information (such as publication 
date, subject category, author, country of origin, title, abstract, and 
keywords) were extracted and the full texts were obtained for the co-citation 
analysis. Data were linked with the life expectancy at birth (years) and Gross 
National Income (GNI). Co-citation and hierarchal clustering analysis was used 
to map the trends and research networks with CiteSpace II (JAVA freeware, 
copyright Chaomei Chen, http://cluster.cis.drexel.edu/~cchen/citespace/).
FINDINGS: We identified 2864 relevant publications as at June 2016, with the 
first paper on this topic indexed in 1974 from Germany, but 80% were published 
after 2010. Further analysis yielded two knowledge gaps: (1) compared with 
single conditions (diabetes, hypertension, depression, and COPD), there is a 
mismatch between the high prevalence of multimorbidity and its research outputs 
(ratio of articles on multimorbidity vs other four single conditions is 
1:13-150); (2) although a total of 76 countries have contributed to this 
research area, only 5% of research originated from LMICs where 73% of 
non-communicable disease (NCD) related deaths had occurred. Additional analysis 
showed the median year of first publication occurred 15 years later in the LMICs 
compared with HICs (2010 vs 1995); and longer life expectancy was associated 
with exponentially higher publication outputs (Pearson correlation coefficient 
r = 0.95) at the global level. The life expectancy at the median year (1994) of 
first publication was 66.1, with the gap between LMICs and HICs 7.9 (68.4 vs 
76.3).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms substantial knowledge gaps in the research 
agenda on multimorbidity, with input urgently needed to move us forward 
worldwide, especially for and in LMICs. There is the possibility that LMICs can 
learn from and collaborate with HICs in this area.

Personalized medicine could transform healthcare.

Mathur S(1), Sutton J(1).

Author information:
(1)Molecular Drug Research Laboratory, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh 
EH11 4BN, UK.

Personalized medicine (PM) is about tailoring a treatment as individualized as 
the disease. The approach relies on identifying genetic, epigenomic, and 
clinical information that allows the breakthroughs in our understanding of how a 
person's unique genomic portfolio makes them vulnerable to certain diseases. PM 
approach is a complete extension of traditional approach (One-Size-Fits-All) to 
increasing our ability to predict which medical treatments will be safe and 
effective for individual patient, and which ones will not be, based on the 
patient's unique genetic profile. Implementation of PM has the potential to 
reduce financial and time expenditure, and increase quality of life and life 
extension of patients. Knowledge of PM facilitates earlier disease detection via 
enhanced use of existing biomarkers and detection of early genomic and 
epigenomic events in disease development, particularly carcinogenesis. The PM 
approach predominantly focuses on preventative medicine and favours taking 
pro-active actions rather than just reactive. This approach delays or prevents 
the need to apply more severe treatments which are usually less tolerated and 
with increased quality of life and financial considerations. Increasing 
healthcare costs have placed additional pressure on government funded healthcare 
systems globally, especially regarding end of life care. PM may increase the 
effectiveness of existing treatments and negate the inherent problems associated 
with non-PM approaches. PM is a young but rapidly expanding field of healthcare 
where a physician can select a treatment based on a patient's genetic profile 
that may not only minimize harmful side effects and guarantee a more successful 
result, but can be less cost effective compared with a 'trial-and-error' 
approach to disease treatment. The less efficient non-PM ('trial-and-error') 
approach, which can lead to drug toxicity, severe side effects, reactive 
treatment and misdiagnosis continue to contribute to increasing healthcare 
costs. Increased patient stratification will allow for the enhanced application 
of PM and pro-active treatment regimens, resulting in reduced costs and quality 
of life enhancement.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent chronic pathologies 
in the world. In developing countries, such as Mexico, its prevalence represents 
an important public health and research issue. Determining factors triggering 
T2DM are environmental and genetic. While diet, exercise and proper weight 
control are the first measures recommended to improve the quality of life and 
life expectancy of patients, pharmacological treatment is usually the next step. 
Within every population there are variations in interindividual drug response, 
which may be due to genetic background. Some of the most frequent first line 
T2DM treatments in developing countries are sulfonylureas (SU), whose targets 
are ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). Single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of the KATP coding genes, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J 
member 11 (KCNJ11) and ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8) have 
been associated with SU response variability. To date, there is little 
information regarding the mechanism by which these SNPs work within Mexican 
populations. The present study describes the distribution of three SNPs [KCNJ11 
rs5219 (E23K), ABCC8 rs757110 (S1369A) and rs1799854 (-3C/T)] among Mestizo 
Mexican (MM) T2DM patients, and compares it with published data on various 
healthy subjects and T2DM populations. Through this comparison, no difference in 
the KCNJ11 rs5219 and ABCC8 rs757110 allelic and genotypic frequencies in MM 
were observed compared with the majority of the reported populations of healthy 
and diabetic individuals among other ethnic groups; except for African and 
Colombian individuals. By contrast, ABCC8 rs1799854 genomic and allelic 
frequencies among MM were observed to be significantly different from those 
reported by the 1000 Genomes Project, and from diabetic patients within other 
populations reported in the literature, such as the European, Asian and 
Latin-American individuals [T=0.704, G=0.296; CC=0.506, CT=0.397, TT=0.097; 95% 
confidence interval (CI); P≤0.05]; except for South Asian and Iberian 
populations, which may reflect the admixture origins of the present Mexican 
population. This genetic similarity has not been observed in the other 
Latin-American groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of 
ABCC8 rs757110 and rs1799854 SNP frequencies in any Mexican population and, 
specifically with diabetic Mexicans. Knowledge of the genetic structure of 
different populations is key to understanding the interindividual responses to 
drugs, such as SU and whether genotypic differences affect clinical outcome.

The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the treatment 
outcomes of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with S-1, an oral 
fluoropyrimidine anticancer agent, for advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC). The study population consisted of 47 patients with clinical stage III or 
IV oral SCC, who underwent CCRT with S-1. Pretreatment variables, including 
patient age, clinical stage, T classification, midline involvement of the 
primary tumor and nodal status, were analyzed as predictors of survival. In 
addition to the N classification (node-positive, multiple and contralateral), 
the prognostic impact of the level of nodal involvement was assessed. Nodal 
involvement was mainly observed at levels Ib and II; involvement at levels Ia 
and III-V was considered to be anterior and inferior extension, respectively, 
and was recorded as extensive nodal involvement (ENI). The 3-year overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 37 and 27%, 
respectively. A finding of ENI was a significant factor for OS [hazard ratio 
(HR)=2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-4.55; P=0.038] and PFS (HR=2.65; 
95% CI: 1.32-5.33; P=0.005); the 3-year OS and PFS rates in patients with vs. 
those without ENI were 23 vs. 50% and 9 vs. 43%, respectively. The other 
variables were not significant. Therefore, CCRT with S-1 may be an alternative 
treatment for advanced oral SCC; favorable outcomes are expected in patients 
without ENI.

BACKGROUND: Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disease characterized by 
hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction (HVOTO).
METHODS: Recent literature has been analyzed for this narrative review.
RESULTS: Primary BCS/HVOTO is a result of thrombosis. The same patient often has 
multiple risk factors for venous thrombosis and most have at least one. 
Presentation and etiology may differ between Western and certain Eastern 
countries. Myeloproliferative neoplasms are present in 40% of patients and are 
usually associated with the V617F-JAK2 mutation in myeloid cells, in particular 
peripheral blood granulocytes. Presentation and symptoms vary, thus this 
diagnosis must be considered in any patient with acute or chronic liver disease. 
Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging of the 
hepatic veins and inferior vena cava usually successfully provide noninvasive 
identification of the obstruction or its consequences in the collaterals of 
hepatic veins or the inferior vena cava. The reported life expectancy in these 
patients is 3 years after the first symptoms. The therapeutic strategy includes 
first, anticoagulation, correction of risk factors, diuretics, and prophylaxis 
for portal hypertension, then angioplasty for short-length venous stenosis 
followed by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and finally 
liver transplantation. The progression of treatment is based on the response to 
therapy at each step. This strategy results in a 5-year survival rate of nearly 
85%. The medium-term prognosis depends upon the severity of liver disease, and 
the long-term outcome can be jeopardized by transformation of underlying 
conditions and hepatocellular carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: BCS/HVOTO hepatic manifestations of BCS/HVOTO can be controlled in 
most patients with medical or radiological interventions. Underlying disease has 
become the major determinant of patient outcome.

BACKGROUND: An interesting area of scientific research is the development of 
potential antiaging drugs. In order to pursue this goal, it is necessary to 
gather the specific knowledge about the adequate preclinical models that are 
available to evaluate the beneficial effects of new potential drugs. This review 
is focused on invertebrate and vertebrate preclinical models used to evaluate 
the efficacy of antiaging compounds, with the objective to extend life span and 
health span.
METHODS: Research and online content related to aging, antiaging drugs, 
experimental aging models is reviewed. Moreover, in this review, the main 
experimental preclinical models of organisms that have contributed to the 
research in the pharmacology of lifespan extension and the understanding of the 
aging process are discussed.
RESULTS: Dietary restriction (DR) constitutes a common experimental process to 
extend life span in all organisms. Besides, classical antiaging drugs such as 
resveratrol, rapamycin and metformin denominated as DR mimetics are also 
discussed. Likewise, the main therapeutic targets of these drugs include 
sirtuins, IGF-1, and mTOR, all of them being modulated by DR.
CONCLUSION: Advances in molecular biology have uncovered the potential molecular 
pathways involved in the aging process. Due to their characteristics, 
invertebrate models are mainly used for drug screening. The National Institute 
on Aging (NIA) developed the Interventions Testing Program (ITP). At the 
preclinical level, the ITP uses Heterogeneous mouse model (HET) which is 
probably the most suitable rodent model to study potential drugs against aging 
prevention. The accelerated-senescence mouse P8 is also a mammalian rodent model 
for aging research. However, when evaluating the effect of drugs on a 
preclinical level, the evaluation must be done in non-human primates since it is 
the mammalian specie closest to humans. Research is needed to investigate the 
impact of new potential drugs for the increase of human quality of life.

Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery and Fellow of the QNI.

The rise in life expectancy requires strategies to enable healthy ageing and the 
promotion of a high quality of life in old age. Poor mental health including 
depression and social isolation can blight older people's lives. Despite the 
positive benefits of physical activity for both mental and physical health, only 
a minority of those over 65 years are attaining the recommended levels of 
physical activity. The evidence relating to the benefits of pet dogs as 
promoters of wellbeing is set out in this article, although meeting their care 
needs may place an additional strain on an older person and/or their carer who 
has limited resources and physical capabilities.

The role of recombinant activated factor VII in the haematological management of 
elective orthopaedic surgery in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors.

"Careggi" University Hospital, Florence, Italy.

The clinical profile and expectations of haemophilic patients with inhibitors 
have changed over the last three decades, mainly because of the prolongation of 
life-expectancy, often resulting in an increase of the orthopaedic burden. 
Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is the most frequently used bypassing 
agent in haemophilia patients with inhibitors during elective orthopaedic 
surgery. For nearly 30 years, rFVIIa has been successfully used to control 
haemostasis in several major and minor surgical procedures. Clinical trials, 
case series, reports and surveys were progressively aimed at optimising rFVIIa 
usage in very demanding conditions managed in highly specialised centres. 
Recommendations from consensus opinions and guidelines have been provided on the 
basis of this clinical experience.

BACKGROUND: Patients with esophageal cancer seldom achieve long-term survival. 
This prospective cohort study investigated the selection of patients likely to 
benefit from curative treatment and whether information on patients' 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) would assist treatment decisions in the 
multidisciplinary team.
METHODS: Consecutive patients completed HRQL assessments and clinical data were 
collected before start of treatment. Logistic regression analyses identified 
clinical factors associated with treatment intent in patients with stage-III 
disease. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analyses and Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to assess the impact of clinical factors and HRQL on 
survival in patients planned for curative treatment.
RESULTS: Patients with curative treatment intent (n = 90) were younger, had 
better WHO performance status and less fatigue than patients with palliative 
treatment intent (n = 89). Median survival for the total cohort (n = 179) and 
patients with palliative or curative treatment intent was nine, five and 19 
months, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, performance 
status (0-1 favorable) and comorbidity (ASA I favorable) were factors of 
importance for survival, whereas measures of HRQL were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients performance status and comorbidity must be considered in 
addition to stage of disease to avoid extensive curative treatment in patients 
with short life expectancy. This study did not provide evidence to support that 
information on patients HRQL adds value to the multidisciplinary team's 
treatment decision process.

Cells and tissues can undergo a variety of biological and structural changes in 
response to mechanical forces. Only a few existing techniques are available for 
quantification of structural changes at high resolution in response to forces 
applied along different directions. 3D-magnetic twisting cytometry (3D-MTC) is a 
technique for applying local mechanical stresses to living cells. Here we 
describe a protocol for interfacing 3D-MTC with confocal fluorescence 
microscopy. In 3D-MTC, ferromagnetic beads are bound to the cell surface via 
surface receptors, followed by their magnetization in any desired direction. A 
magnetic twisting field in a different direction is then applied to generate 
rotational shear stresses in any desired direction. This protocol describes how 
to combine magnetic-field-induced mechanical stimulation with confocal 
fluorescence microscopy and provides an optional extension for super-resolution 
imaging using stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy. This technology 
allows for rapid real-time acquisition of a living cell's mechanical responses 
to forces via specific receptors and for quantifying structural and biochemical 
changes in the same cell using confocal fluorescence microscopy or STED. The 
integrated 3D-MTC-microscopy platform takes ∼20 d to construct, and the 
experimental procedures require ∼4 d when carried out by a life sciences 
graduate student.

Introduction of cART in 1996 has drastically increased the life expectancy of 
people living with HIV-1. However, this treatment has not allowed cure as 
cessation of cART is associated with a rapid viral rebound. The main barrier to 
the eradication of the virus is related to the persistence of latent HIV 
reservoirs. Evidence is now accumulating that purging the HIV-1 reservoir might 
lead to a cure or a remission. The most studied strategy is the so called "shock 
and kill" therapy. This strategy is based on reactivation of dormant viruses 
from the latently-infected reservoirs (the shock) followed by the eradication of 
the reservoirs (the kill). This review focuses mainly on the recent advances 
made in the "shock and kill" therapy. We believe that a cure or a remission will 
come from combinatorial approaches i.e. combination of drugs to reactivate the 
dormant virus from all the reservoirs including the one located in sanctuaries, 
and combination of strategies boosting the immune system. Alternative strategies 
based on cell and gene therapy or based in inducing deep latency, which are 
evoked in this review reinforce the idea that at least a remission is 
attainable.

OBJECTIVES: Deep neck infections (DNIs) can lead to life-threatening disease. 
However, the detailed pathophysiology remains unclear due to its rarity and only 
a few reports have directly compared DNIs in children and adults. This study 
aimed to reveal the clinical differences between DNIs in children and adults.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 123 patients who suffered from DNIs at 
Tohoku University Hospital from August 2005 to July 2015. We extracted data on 
patient sex, age, antecedent illness, extension of infections, operative 
procedures, and bacteriology results. The patients were categorized into 
pediatric (≤18 years) and adult (>18 years) groups. Fisher's exact test was 
performed to determine significant differences between the two groups.
RESULTS: Fifteen children (6 males and 9 females) and 108 adults (71 males and 
37 females) were identified. The most common antecedent illness in pediatric 
patients was lymphadenitis, which was the least common in adult patients (73% vs 
7%, p < 0.0001). The incidence of DNIs extending below the hyoid bone was 
significantly lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients (20% vs 53%, 
p < 0.05). Regarding bacterial culture analysis, Staphylococcus species was the 
most common pathogen in children (60%), whereas only 9% of adults were positive 
for Staphylococcus (p < 0.001). Streptococcus species were significantly less 
common in children than in adults (27% vs 56%, p = 0.05). Anaerobes were also 
significantly less common in children than in adults (13% vs 45%, p < 0.01). 
Concerning surgical intervention, 53% of pediatric patients underwent external 
incision compared with 70% of adults. Specifically, tracheostomy was 
significantly less frequently performed in children than in adults (7% vs 54%, 
p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: DNIs in children feature different characteristics from those in 
adults regarding severity, antecedent illness, bacteriology, and clinical 
management.

Over 3 billion people use solid fuels as a means of energy and heating source, 
and ~ 50% of households burn them in inefficient, poorly ventilated stoves. In 
2010, ~ 43% of the 640 million preschool children in 220 countries suffered from 
a certain degree of anemia, with iron deficiency as the main cause in developed 
countries whereas its causes remained multifactorial in the undeveloped group. 
In this study, we explore the relations of country-wide variables that might 
affect the people's health status (from socioeconomic status to more specific 
variables such as water access). We found independent relationship between solid 
fuel use and anemia in children under five years old (p < 0.0001), taking into 
account the prevalence of anemia in pregnant woman and the access to improved 
water sources. Countries in which the population uses solid fuel the most have 
over three times higher anemia rates in children than countries with the lowest 
prevalence of solid fuels use. There is still a complex relationship between 
solid fuels use and anemia, as reflected in its worldwide significance (p < 
0.05) controlled for measles immunization, tobacco consumption, anemia in 
pregnant mothers, girl's primary education, life expectancy and improved water 
access but not (p > 0.05) when weighing for sanitation access or income per 
capita.

Research into the genetic component of human longevity can provide important 
insights in mechanisms that may protect against age-related diseases and 
multi-morbidity. Thus far only a limited number of robust longevity loci have 
been detected in either candidate or genome wide association studies. One of the 
issues in these genetic studies is the definition of the trait being either 
lifespan, including any age at death or longevity, i.e. survival above a diverse 
series of thresholds. Likewise heritability and segregation research have 
conflated lifespan with longevity. The heritability of lifespan estimated across 
most studies has been rather low. Environmental factors have not been 
sufficiently investigated and the total amount of genetic variance contributing 
to longevity has not been estimated in sufficiently well-defined and powered 
studies. Up to now, genetic longevity studies lack the required insights into 
the nature and size of the genetic component and the optimal strategies for 
meta-analysis and subject selection for Next Generation Sequencing efforts. 
Historical demographic data containing deep genealogical information may help in 
estimating the best definition and heritability for longevity, its transmission 
patterns in multi-generational datasets and may allow relevant additive and 
modifying environmental factors such as socio-economic status, geographical 
background, exposure to environmental effects, birth order, and number of 
children to be included. In this light historical demographic data may be very 
useful for identifying lineages in human populations that are worth 
investigating further by geneticists.

RATIONALE: There is growing recognition that in addition to universally 
recognised domains and indicators of wellbeing (such as population health and 
life expectancy), additional frameworks are required to fully explain and 
measure Indigenous wellbeing. In particular, Indigenous Australian wellbeing is 
largely determined by colonisation, historical trauma, grief, loss, and ongoing 
social marginalisation. Dominant mainstream indicators of wellbeing based on the 
biomedical model may therefore be inadequate and not entirely relevant in the 
Indigenous context. It is possible that "standard" wellbeing instruments fail to 
adequately assess indicators of health and wellbeing within societies that have 
a more holistic view of health.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this critical review was to identify, document, and 
evaluate the use of social and emotional wellbeing measures within the 
Australian Indigenous community.
METHOD: The instruments were systematically described regarding their intrinsic 
properties (e.g., generic v. disease-specific, domains assessed, extent of 
cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric characteristics) and their purpose of 
utilisation in studies (e.g., study setting, intervention, clinical purpose or 
survey). We included 33 studies, in which 22 distinct instruments were used.
RESULTS: Three major categories of social and emotional wellbeing instruments 
were identified: unmodified standard instruments (10), cross-culturally adapted 
standard instruments (6), and Indigenous developed measures (6). Recommendations 
are made for researchers and practitioners who assess social and emotional 
wellbeing in Indigenous Australians, which may also be applicable to other 
minority groups where a more holistic framework of wellbeing is applied.
CONCLUSION: It is advised that standard instruments only be used if they have 
been subject to a formal cross-cultural adaptation process, and Indigenous 
developed measures continue to be developed, refined, and validated within a 
diverse range of research and clinical settings.
