to enrich the data with additional information. The Regulatory Circuits project 
is one of the largest efforts for integrating human cell genomics data to 
predict tissue-specific transcription factor-genes interaction networks. In 
spite of its success, it exhibits the usual shortcomings limiting its update, 
its reuse (as a whole or partially), and its extension with new data samples. To 
address these limitations, the resource has previously been integrated in an RDF 
triplestore so that TF-gene interaction networks could be generated with two 
SPARQL queries. However, this triplestore did not store the computed networks 
and did not integrate metadata about tissues and samples, therefore limiting the 
reuse of this dataset. In particular, it does not enable to reuse only a portion 
of Regulatory Circuits if a study focuses on a subset of the tissues, nor to 
combine the samples described in the datasets with samples from other studies. 
Overall, these limitations advocate for the design of a complete, flexible and 
reusable representation of the Regulatory Circuits dataset based on Semantic Web 
technologies.
RESULTS: We provide a modular RDF representation of the Regulatory Circuits, 
called Linked Extended Regulatory Circuits (LERC). It consists in (i) 
descriptions of biological and experimental context mapped to the references 
databases, (ii) annotations about TF-gene interactions at the sample level for 
808 samples, (iii) annotations about TF-gene interactions at the tissue level 
for 394 tissues, (iv) metadata connecting the knowledge graphs cited above. LERC 
is based on a modular organisation into 1,205 RDF named graphs for representing 
the biological data, the sample-specific and the tissue-specific networks, and 
the corresponding metadata. In total it contains 3,910,794,050 triples and is 
available as a SPARQL endpoint.
CONCLUSION: The flexible and modular architecture of LERC supports 
biologically-relevant SPARQL queries. It allows an easy and fast querying of the 
resources related to the initial Regulatory Circuits datasets and facilitates 
its reuse in other studies. ASSOCIATED WEBSITE:

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic clocks have been associated with cancer risk in several 
observational studies. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether they play a causal 
role in cancer risk or if they act as a non-causal biomarker.
METHODS: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine 
the genetically predicted effects of epigenetic age acceleration as measured by 
HannumAge (nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), Horvath Intrinsic Age 
(24 SNPs), PhenoAge (11 SNPs), and GrimAge (4 SNPs) on multiple cancers (i.e. 
breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer). We obtained genome-wide 
association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N = 34,710), and 
for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases = 2671-13,879; N controls = 
173,493-372,016), FinnGen (N cases = 719-8401; N controls = 74,685-174,006) and 
several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases = 11,348-122,977; N 
controls = 15,861-105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative 
random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates 
were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included 
MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary 
Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of 
the IVW approach.
RESULTS: Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge 
acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.12 per year 
increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95% CI 1.04-1.20, p = 0.002). The direction of 
the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR 
analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge 
acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21, p = 
0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.13, p = 0.24). Results 
were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and 
cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. 
Findings for other clocks and cancers were inconsistent. Further work is 
required to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the results.

Plain Language Summary: Have you noticed that some people seem to get older 
faster than others? Scientists have previously found that a chemical tag on DNA 
known as DNA methylation can be used to predict an individual’s chronological 
age. However, age predicted using DNA methylation (also known as biological or 
epigenetic age) does not always perfectly correspond to chronological age. 
Indeed, some people’s biological age is higher than their years, while other 
people’s is lower. When an individual’s biological age is higher than their 
chronological age, they are said to be experiencing ‘epigenetic age 
acceleration’. This type of accelerated ageing, which can be measured with 
‘epigenetic clocks’ based on DNA methylation, has been associated with several 
adverse health outcomes, including cancer. This means that epigenetic clocks may 
improve our ability to predict cancer risk and detect cancer early. However, it 
is still unclear whether accelerated biological ageing causes cancer, or whether 
it simply correlates with the disease. Morales-Berstein et al. wanted to 
investigate whether epigenetic age acceleration, as measured by epigenetic 
clocks, plays a role in the development of several cancers. To do so, they used 
an approach known as Mendelian randomization. Using genetic variants as natural 
experiments, they studied the effect of different measures of epigenetic age 
acceleration on cancer risk. Their work focused on five types of cancer: breast, 
colorectal, prostate, ovarian and lung cancer. They used genetic association 
data from people of European ancestry to determine whether genetic variants that 
are strongly associated with accelerated ageing are also strongly associated 
with cancer. The results showed that one of the DNA methylation markers used as 
an estimate of biological ageing could be directly related to the risk of 
developing colorectal cancer. This work provides new insights into the 
relationship between markers of biological ageing and cancer. Similar 
relationships should also be studied in other groups of people and for other 
cancer sites. The results suggest that reversing biological ageing by altering 
DNA methylation could prevent or delay the development of colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVES: To measure motor competence among a representative sample of 
Iranians aged 5-85 years.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: Motor competence was assessed quantitatively by the Test of Motor 
Competence; two fine motor skills (placing and building bricks) and two gross 
motor skills (heel-to-toe-walking and walking/running in slopes) to assess 
dynamic balance. Task scores were summed and transformed into standardized 
scores (z-scores). Data were stratified by 12 chronological age groups and sex.
RESULTS: Participants were 500 Iranians aged 5-85 years (females = 64%, age 
5-35 years = 82%). There were significant age differences in motor competence 
and the distribution between age and z-score distribution was u-shaped. Between 
childhood and adolescence there was a rapid improvement in motor competence with 
maximal speed (-2 standard deviations) occurring among 19-25-year-olds. For each 
decade after age 25 years, z-scores progressively decreased approximately 1 
standard deviations until age ≥56 years when performance decreased to 
approximately the same speeds as children (> +3 standard deviations). Sex 
differences were observed between children and adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: The sample characteristics constrain the generalizability of our 
findings. The Test of Motor Competence is easy to administer, uses a 
standardized test battery for people aged 5-85 years, and the quantitative 
outcome enables longitudinal monitoring of motor competence across the life 
course. As life expectancy and the proportion of populations aged >65 years 
increases, understanding how to maintain health in older age is an important 
public health issue in 21st century.

BACKGROUND: Although a few studies have reported the relationship between high 
and low temperatures and chronic kidney disease (CKD), the global burden of CKD 
attributable to extreme heat and cold in recent decades remains unknown.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, we obtained 
data on age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized rates of 
disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) per 100 000 population of the CKD 
attributable to non-optimum temperatures from 1990 to 2019. The annual mean 
temperature of each country was used to divide each country into five climate 
zones (tropical, subtropical, warm-temperate, cool-temperate, and boreal). The 
locally weighted regression model was used to estimate the burden for different 
climate zones and Socio-demographic index (SDI) regions.
RESULTS: In 1990, the ASMR and ASDR due to high temperature estimated -0.01 (95% 
UI, -0.74 to 0.44) and -0.32 (-21.66 to 12.66) per 100 000 population, 
respectively. In 2019, the ASMR and ASDR reached 0.10 (-0.28 to 0.38) and 2.71 
(-8.07 to 10.46), respectively. The high-temperature burden increased most 
rapidly in tropical and low SDI regions. There were 0.99 (0.59 to 1.39) ASMR 
attributable to low-temperature in 1990, which increased to 1.05 (0.61-1.49) in 
2019. While the ASDR due to low temperature declined from 22.03 (12.66 to 30.64) 
in 1990 to 20.43 (11.30 to 29.26) in 2019. Overall, the burden of CKD 
attributable to non-optimal temperatures has increased from 1990 to 2019. CKD 
due to hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the primary causes of CKD death 
attributable to non-optimum temperatures in 2019 with males and older adults 
being more susceptible to these temperatures.
CONCLUSIONS: The CKD burden due to high, low, and non-optimum temperatures 
varies considerably by regions and countries. The burden of CKD attributable to 
high temperature has been increasing since 1990.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) is increasing. Life expectancy is improving in T1D, resulting in a growing 
population of elderly adults with diabetes. While it is well established that 
older adults with T2D are at increased risk of cognitive impairment, little is 
known regarding cognitive aging in T1D and how their cognitive profiles may 
differ from T2D.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared baseline cognitive function and low 
cognitive function by diabetes status (n=734 T1D, n=232 T2D, n=247 without 
diabetes) among individuals from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes (mean 
age=68). We used factor analysis to group cognition into five domains and a 
composite measure of total cognition. Using linear and logistic regression 
models, we examined the associations between diabetes type and cognitive 
function, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, depression, and sleep 
quality.
RESULTS: T1D was associated with lower scores on total cognition, language, 
executive function/psychomotor processing speed, and verbal episodic memory, and 
greater odds of low executive function/psychomotor processing speed (OR=2.99, 
95% CI 1.66 to 5.37) and verbal episodic memory (OR=1.92, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.46), 
compared with those without diabetes. T2D was associated with lower scores on 
visual episodic memory. Compared with T2D, T1D was associated with lower scores 
on verbal episodic memory and executive function/psychomotor processing speed 
and greater odds of low executive function/psychomotor processing speed 
(OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with T1D had significantly poorer cognition compared 
with those with T2D and those without diabetes even after accounting for a range 
of comorbidities. Future studies should delineate how to reduce risk in this 
vulnerable population who are newly surviving to old age.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular 
malignant tumor. This malignancy is frequently treated using brachytherapy, 
stereotactic radiotherapy, or proton therapy. The objective of this study was to 
assess the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of large and 
posterior UM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2014 to July 2021, we treated 65 patients 
(median age=71 years; range=31-89 years) affected by UM. Inclusion criteria were 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤2, life 
expectancy >6 months, tumor thickness >10 mm, diameter >16 mm or posterior UM. 
The treatment was delivered with a True Beam™ LINAC with arc modulation 
technique. All patients received 27 Gy in one fraction (biological effective 
dose ≈100 Gy, assuming an α/β of 10).
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 36 (range=3-90) months. Acute toxicities were 
reported in 14 patients, whereas late toxicity occurred in 45 (69.2%). Fifteen 
patients (23.0%) underwent enucleation: eight (12.3%) for failure of local 
control and seven (10.7%) for late treatment co-morbidities. The 5-year local 
control, and progression-free, metastasis-free, enucleation-free, and overall 
survival rates were 80%, 43%, 62%, 65% and 56%, respectively. In multivariate 
analysis, tumor dimensions significantly influenced survival [larger basal 
diameter: progression-free [hazard ratio (HR)=2.42] and overall (HR=2.61) 
survival; greater thickness: overall survival (HR=2.36)]. In multivariate 
analysis, patients without local control had a higher risk of distant metastasis 
(HR=3.25).
CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery offers an effective and safe approach for 
selected cases of UM due to the satisfactory results in terms of local control, 
eye conservation and survival.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects people from all age 
categories worldwide. Although the incidence of the disease is stabilizing or 
decreasing in most Western world countries, its prevalence is still increasing 
because of the rise in life expectancy and better disease management. This work 
intends to identify the trends related to IBD incidence nationwide, analyzing 
regional, sex, and age distributions.
METHODS: Data were provided by the Portuguese Shared Services of the Ministry of 
Health. This study consisted of a retrospective analysis of all first 
consultations coded for "Chronic enteritis/ulcerative colitis" (D94) in a 
primary healthcare setting, between 2017 and 2020, in Portugal. The primary 
outcome measure was the IBD incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants. We also 
calculated the incidence rate per person-year and forecasted incidence until 
2024.
RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2019, the incidence rate of IBD in Portugal decreased 
from 54.9 to 48.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The average incidence was 20 new 
cases of IBD per 1,000 person-year. It was predicted that, in December 2023, IBD 
incidence would reach 305.4 new cases (95% Prediction Interval 156.6-454.3), a 
similar result to the values forecasted for December 2021 (305.4, 95% Prediction 
Interval 197.3-413.6).
DISCUSSION: The incidence of IBD slightly declined from 2017 to 2019, and it is 
posed to stabilize in the future. The presented data are of the utmost 
importance for the characterization of IBD in Southern European countries and 
the establishment of future health policies in the setting of compounding 
prevalence in the Western world.

This review of reviews aimed to appraise the use of the CONSORT-PRO Extension as 
an evaluation tool for assessing the reporting of patient-reported outcome 
(PROs) in publications, and to describe the reporting of PRO research across 
reviews. We also outlined how variation in such evaluations impacts knowledge 
translation and may lead to potential misuse of the CONSORT-PRO Extension. We 
systematically searched Medline, Pubmed and CINAHL from 2013 to 2025 March 2021 
for reviews of the completeness of reporting of PRO endpoints according to 
CONSORT-PRO criteria. Two reviewers extracted details of each review, the 
percentage of included studies that addressed each CONSORT-PRO item, and key 
recommendations from each review. Fourteen reviews met inclusion criteria, and 
only six of these used the full CONSORT-PRO checklist with minimal justified 
modifications. The remaining eight studies made significant or unjustified 
adjustments to the CONSORT-PRO Extension. Review studies also varied in how they 
scored multi-component CONSORT-PRO items. CONSORT-PRO items were often 
unreported in trial reports, and certain CONSORT-PRO items were reported less 
often than others. The reporting of statistical approaches to dealing with 
missing PRO data were poor in RCTs included in all 14 review articles. Studies 
reviewing PRO publications often omitted recommended CONSORT-PRO items from 
their evaluations, which may cause confusion among readers regarding how best to 
report their PRO research according to the CONSORT-PRO extension. Many trials 
published since CONSORT-PRO's release did not report recommended CONSORT-PRO 
items, which may lead to misinterpretation and consequently to research waste.

BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive liver 
disease, and many patients ultimately require liver transplantation (LT). PSC 
also confers an increased risk of malignancies, including cholangiocarcinoma 
(CCA) and colorectal cancer.
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate patient-perceived outcomes and the extent to 
which these impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHODS: Patients with PSC completed a risk perception questionnaire, the Short 
Form-36 (SF-36), and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire. Multivariable 
models were used to determine factors associated with patient-perceived risks of 
malignancy, LT, and life expectancy, as well as their relationship with HRQoL 
scores.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients completed the risk perception questionnaire, and 
73 returned the remaining instruments. The estimated risks varied widely. Half 
overestimated their one-year or lifetime CCA risk, while some predicted zero 
chance. Predicted LT risk was the only outcome concordant with disease severity. 
Pruritus was associated with higher predicted one-year risks and lower life 
expectancy. Lifetime CCA and LT risks were associated with the SF-36 physical 
component score, while perceived life expectancy was strongly associated with 
mental health domains, including the SF-36 mental component score.
CONCLUSIONS: Predicted prognosis varies widely among patients with PSC and is 
influenced more by symptoms than objective disease severity. The psychological 
burden of shorter perceived life expectancy impacts mental HRQoL more than the 
risks of malignancy or LT. These findings highlight an opportunity for improved 
patient communication regarding these outcomes, as well as the importance of 
discussing them, as they may impact HRQoL.

BACKGROUND: Estimated frequency of aortic stenosis (AS) in those over 75 years 
of age is 3.4%. Symptomatic patients with severe AS have increased morbidity and 
mortality and aortic valve replacement should be offered to improve life 
expectancy and quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: To identify whether systolic time intervals can identify severe AS.
METHODS: The study comprised 200 patients (mean age 79 years, 55% men). Patients 
were equally divided into normal, mild, moderate, or severe AS. All patients had 
normal ejection fraction. Acceleration time (AT) was defined as the time from 
the beginning of systolic flow to maximal velocity; ejection time (ET) was the 
time from onset to end of systolic flow. The relation of AT/ET was calculated. 
Death or aortic valve intervention were documented. AT increased linearly with 
the severity of AS, similar to ET and AT/ET ratio (P for trend < 0.05 for all). 
Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that AT can 
identify severe AS with a cutoff ≥ 108 msec with 100% sensitivity and 98% 
specificity, while a cutoff of 0.34 when using AT/ET ratio can identify severe 
AS with 96% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Multivariate analysis adjusting to 
sex, stroke volume index, heart rate, and body mass index showed similar 
results. Kaplan-Meier curve for AT ≥ 108 and AT/ET ≥ 0.34 predicted death or 
aortic valve intervention in a 3-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceleration time and AT/ET ratio are reliable measurements for 
identifying patients with severe AS. Furthermore, AT and AT/ET were able to 
predict aortic valve replacement or death.

Increased life expectancy due to improved cancer prognosis, shared determinants 
(e.g., tobacco use), and cardiovascular toxicities related to cancer therapies, 
including the adverse cardiometabolic effects of androgen deprivation therapy 
for prostate cancer, make cardiovascular disease an frequent and important 
co-morbidity in patients with a genitourinary malignancy. Complex cardiovascular 
disease can pose significant challenges in the management of these patients 
given the uncertainties related to the best approach to reconcile ischemic and 
bleeding risks, and the role of invasive cardiovascular interventions in 
individuals with advanced cancer. In this review, we discuss the current 
evidence that informs decision-making in this clinical context.

INTRODUCTION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 
downward trends in life expectancy and racial/ethnic differences between 2014 
and 2017.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the life expectancy of the Kaiser Permanente 
Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS) insured population as compared to the CDC National 
Vital Statistics data from 2014 to 2017. We also aimed to highlight the 
utilization of membership data to inform population statistical estimates such 
as life expectancy. We examine whether national trends in life expectancy are 
reflected in an insured population with relatively uniform access to care.
METHODS: This retrospective, data only study examined life expectancy between 
2014 and 2017. Data from electronic medical records and the National Death Index 
were combined to construct complete life tables by race and sex for the KPMAS 
population, which was compared to the CDC National Vital Statistics data.
RESULTS: From 2014 to 2017, the overall KPMAS population life expectancy at 
birth varied between 84.6 and 85.2 years compared to the CDC reported national 
average of 78.6-78.9 years (p < 0.001). While the CDC dataset reported a 3.5- to 
3.7-year life expectancy gap between non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black 
populations, in the KPMAS population, this gap was significantly smaller 
(0.0-0.9 years). The gap in life expectancy between males and females was 
consistent across KPMAS and the CDC data; however, overall KPMAS male and female 
patient life expectancy was extended in comparison.
CONCLUSION: Among members who disclosed their race/ethnicity, KPMAS Hispanic, 
non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White members had significantly higher life 
expectancies than the CDC dataset in all years reported.

This research further expands previous studies in which color contrast between 
ridges and furrows was examined as a possible age indicator for latent 
fingermarks. Here, the variable biological sex and its influence on aging were 
investigated. A total of 756 sebaceous-rich impressions from seven males and 
seven females were deposited on glass and polystyrene plastic and aged in the 
dark for three months. At nine discrete times, random fingermarks were 
visualized with a titanium dioxide-based powder (TiO2 ), photographed, and 
edited in Photoshop® to collect pixel color data. Two color contrast-related 
metrics, mean color intensity (MI) and intensity amplitude (IA), were analyzed 
to determine whether the aging processes of biological male and female 
fingermarks were equivalent. These metrics revealed that impressions from the 
different biological sexes behaved in a similar manner over time. However, 
significant effects between substrates were observed. Quadratic regression 
models best represented the aging trends based on the MI and IA metrics for both 
male and female fingermarks. The correlation coefficients (R) and coefficients 
of determination (R2 ) were moderate to strong for impressions on glass but 
weaker for plastic. These findings indicated that biological male and female 
fingermarks could be incorporated into a single universal age estimation model 
per substrate when utilizing color contrast as an age indicator. Nonetheless, 
future studies are needed to better understand aging processes on plastic when 
using this methodology and to determine the life expectancy (i.e., the potential 
for identification) of latent fingermarks beyond three months.

OBJECTIVE: Productivity-adjusted life-years (PALYs) offers a novel approach for 
quantifying the productivity burden of chronic conditions at the population 
level over the working lifespan. This study was undertaken to estimate the 
productivity burden of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) among working-age Australians, 
defined as lost PALYs and lost gross domestic product (GDP).
METHODS: A static life-table model was constructed to simulate the experiences 
of working Australians (between the ages of 15-64 years) with KOA and those 
without KOA, with follow-up to 65 years (retirement age), a 1-year cycle length, 
and an annual discount rate of 5%. KOA prevalence data were obtained from the 
2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study. Demographic 
and mortality data were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Health 
utilities and productivity indices were derived from published sources. 
Population-level losses in years of life, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and PALYs attributable to KOA were estimated by comparing estimates in the KOA 
cohort to the no KOA cohort.
RESULTS: In 2019, a total of 913,539 working-age Australians were estimated to 
have KOA, with an overall prevalence of 5.5% (4.5% in men and 6.5% in women). By 
retirement age, KOA was associated with 39,602 excess deaths, 125,651 years of 
life lost, 1,938,059 QALYs lost, and 1,943,287 PALYs lost. The economic impact 
of lost productivity due to KOA amounted to 424 billion Australian dollars in 
lost GDP.
CONCLUSION: Our modeling demonstrates a significant economic burden of KOA among 
the working Australian population, with marked productivity loss. Our findings 
highlight the need for public health funding and scalable population-level 
strategies for effective KOA prevention and support to maintain productive 
working.

(1)Radiology department, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the frequency, demographics, primary disease and 
cumulative effective dose of patients undergoing two or more 18F-FDG PET/CT 
examinations in a year.
METHODS: In a retrospective study performed at a tertiary-care hospital, 
patients who underwent ≥2 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in a calendar year were 
identified for two consecutive years. The CT radiation dose was calculated using 
dose-length-product and sex-specific conversion factors. The primary malignancy 
of patients was retrieved from electronic medical records.
RESULTS: 10,714 18F-FDG PET/CT exams were performed for 6,831 unique patients in 
2 years, yielding an average of 1.6 exams per patient. The maximum number of 
18F-FDG PET/CT examinations any patient underwent in a single year was seven.
