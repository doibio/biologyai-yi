affect relates to symptoms as they occur naturalistically in daily life or as a 
within-person dynamic process.
METHOD: 135 treatment-seeking adults completed a baseline assessment of trait 
affect and then rated current affect and symptoms (depression, social anxiety, 
panic, worry) three times per day for 10 days. Multilevel structural equation 
modeling was used, and prospective analyses held constant current symptoms.
RESULTS: Baseline trait negative affect and individual differences in momentary 
negative affect predicted all four symptoms in daily life, whereas low positive 
affect predicted greater depression only. Similar results were found for 
within-person concurrent analyses. Prospectively, momentary negative affect 
predicted increased depression up to 24 h later, and increased panic or worry up 
to 8-16 h later. Low momentary positive affect predicted greater depression only 
(8 h later).
LIMITATIONS: All data were self-reported, and some relevant anxiety and mood 
symptoms were excluded. The timing of reports was random and may have missed 
notable symptoms. Given the novelty of the study, replication is important.
CONCLUSIONS: Affective models of depression and anxiety derived from 
retrospective assessments demonstrated strong ecological validity. With the 
exception of PA and social anxiety, associations found at the between-person 
level generally applied to within-person processes, which may be amenable to 
tracking and targeting in therapy.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease that leads to 
fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue, caused by circulating antibodies 
against different structures of the neuromuscular junction. In most patients, 
antibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR) can be detected. In a smaller 
proportion of patients with and without AChR antibodies, antibodies to 
muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), or related proteins such as agrin, cortactin and 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), are present. With 
current therapy, most patients achieve a stable condition with good quality of 
life and normal life expectancy. Nevertheless, 10 to 15 % of patients fail to 
respond ad equately to current therapies and are defined as refractory 
myasthenia gravis. Their clinical course is characterized by recurrent episodes 
of severe, acute deterioration, which sometimes appear life threatening. This 
article gives an overview of the current state of myasthenic antibody 
diagnostics and recommended treatment of refractory myasthenia gravis.

Publisher: Die erworbene Myasthenia gravis (MG) wird durch Antikörper gegen 
verschiedene Bestandteile der neuromuskulären Endplatte verursacht. In den 
meisten Fällen wird die typische belastungsabhängige Muskelschwäche durch 
Antikörper gegen den Acetylcholinrezeptor (AChR) verursacht, bei einem 
geringeren Anteil der Patienten finden sich seltenere Antikörper gegen 
Muskel-spezifische Kinase (MuSK) oder verwandte Proteine wie Agrin, Cortactin 
oder Low-Density-Lipoproteinrezeptor-verwandtes Protein 4 (LRP4). Durch 
fachgerechte und konsequente Behandlung kann in der überwiegenden Mehrheit der 
Patienten mit Acetylcholin-Rezeptor-Antikörper (AChR-AK) positiver Myasthenie 
eine nahezu Vollremission mit normaler Lebenserwartung und guter Lebensqualität 
erreicht werden. Etwa 10 bis 15 % der Patienten sprechen nicht adäquat auf 
aktuell empfohlene Therapien an und bilden die Gruppe der refraktären MG. Der 
Artikel gibt einen Überblick über die derzeitige Antikörperdiagnostik und 
Aspekte zum therapierefraktären Verlauf.

[Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches for Mitochondrial Diseases].

Neurologischen Klinik.

Mitochondrial diseases (MD) represent a heterogenous group of disorders and 
syndromes caused either by mutations of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or the 
nuclear DNA (nDNA). They belong to the most frequent neurogenetic diseases. The 
spectrum of clinical manifestations is very broad ranging from mild subclinical 
presentations to rapidly progressive debilitating conditions with reduced life 
expectancy. Mitochondrial dysfunction can affect any organ of the body; the 
clinical presentation is often most severe in tissues with high energy demands. 
The most common MD are Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), Chronic 
Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), 
Mitochondrial Myopathy (MM) and Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis 
and Strokelike episodes (MELAS). In the last couple of years, genetics have 
become more and more important for the diagnosis of MD. The majority of 
syndromes presents with a characteristic combination of clinical and laboratory 
findings which should guide the selection of tissues (blood cells, fibroblasts, 
urothelial cells or muscle) and methods for targeted genetic testing. 
Therapeutic approaches to MD include pharmacological stimulation of 
mitochondrial metabolism, supplementation, symptomatic treatment, assistive 
devices and physiotherapy. Moreover, strict anti-epileptic therapy and treatment 
or prevention of stroke-like episodes are very important to prevent 
complications. In contrast, some medication should be avoided for its direct or 
indirect depressing effect on mitochondrial function. This article provides an 
introduction to mitochondrial diseases, an overview of the most common syndromes 
and an update on established and new therapeutic approaches.

Publisher: Mitochondriale Erkrankungen sind eine Gruppe sehr unterschiedlicher 
Krankheitsbilder und Syndrome, die sowohl durch Mutationen der mitochondrialen 
DNA (mtDNA) als auch der nukleären DNA (nDNA) verursacht werden können. Sie 
gehören zu den häufigsten hereditären neurologischen Erkrankungen.Das Spektrum 
der klinischen Manifestationen ist sehr breit. Es reicht von sehr milden 
Symptomen, die nur langsam progredient sind, bis hin zu Multiorganbeteiligungen, 
die die Lebenserwartung deutlich reduzieren können. Mitochondriopathien können 
grundsätzlich jedes Organ betreffen, wobei Gewebe mit hohem Energiebedarf in der 
Regel stärker betroffen sind. Die häufigsten mitochondrialen Erkrankungen sind 
die Lebersche Hereditäre Optikusneuropathie (LHON), die chronisch progressive 
externe Ophthalmoplegie (CPEO), das Kearns-Sayre-Syndrom (KSS), die 
mitochondriale Myopathie (MM) und die Mitochondriale Enzephalomyopathie mit 
Laktatazidose und Schlaganfall-ähnlichen Episoden (MELAS).Die 
molekulargenetische Diagnostik hat in den letzten Jahren eine zentrale Rolle bei 
der Diagnosesicherung eingenommen. Sie erfolgt abhängig von der klinischen 
Verdachtsdiagnose aus EDTA-Blut, Urin, Fibroblasten oder Muskel.Die Therapie der 
mitochondrialen Erkrankungen umfasst die Überbrückung von Atmungskettendefekten, 
Ansätze, die den mitochondrialen Metabolismus verbessern sollen, sowie die 
Supplementation von Mangelzuständen. Symptomatische Therapien, 
Hilfsmittelversorgung und Physiotherapie, sowie regelmäßige kardiologische 
Kontrolluntersuchungen sind die zweite wichtige Säule der Versorgung. Wenn 
nötig, erfolgt eine antikonvulsive Therapie, sowie die Behandlung und Prävention 
von schlaganfall-ähnlichen Episoden. Im Gegensatz dazu gibt es andere 
Medikamente, die sich direkt oder indirekt negativ auf die Funktionen der 
Mitochondrien auswirken können und daher nur sehr zurückhaltend verordnet werden 
sollten. Dieser Artikel bietet eine Einführung zu den mitochondrialen 
Erkrankungen, einen überblick über die wichtigsten Krankheitsbilder und ein 
Update bezüglich etablierter und neuer Therapieansätze.

BACKGROUND: Home monitoring of foot temperatures in high-risk diabetes patients 
proves to be a promising approach for early recognition and treatment of 
pre-signs of ulceration, and thereby ulcer prevention. Despite previous studies 
demonstrating its efficacy, it is currently not widely applied in (Dutch) health 
care.
METHODS: In a multicenter, outcome-assessor-blinded, randomized controlled 
trial, 304 patients with diabetes mellitus types I or II, loss of protective 
sensation based on peripheral neuropathy, and a history of foot ulceration in 
the preceding 4 years or a diagnosis of Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy will be 
included. Enhanced therapy will consist of usual care and additional at-home 
daily measurement of foot temperatures at six to eight predefined locations on 
the foot. If a contralateral foot temperature difference of > 2.2 °C is found on 
two consecutive days, the participant is instructed to contact their podiatrist 
for further foot diagnosis or treatment, and to reduce ambulatory activity by 
50% until temperatures are normalized. Enhanced therapy will be compared to 
usual care. The primary outcomes are the cost (savings) per patient without a 
foot ulcer (i.e., cost-effectiveness) and per quality-adjusted life year gained 
(i.e., cost-utility). The primary clinical outcome in the study is the 
proportion of patients with foot ulcer recurrence on the plantar foot, apical 
surfaces of the toes, the interdigital spaces or medial and lateral forefoot 
surfaces during 18-month follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Confirmation of the efficacy of at-home foot temperature monitoring 
in ulcer prevention, together with assessing its usability, cost-effectiveness 
and cost-utility, could lead to implementation in Dutch health care, and in many 
settings across the world.

PURPOSE: There is a known increased risk of second primary malignancy (SPM) in 
patients with prostate cancer (CaP) treated with radiotherapy (RT). It is 
unclear how age at diagnosis influences the risk of SPMs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the 1973 to 2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results Program, we studied the impact of age on SPMs (defined as a bladder 
or rectal tumor) after localized CaP treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP) 
or RT. SPM risk was compared using inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW)-adjusted cumulative incidence function and competing-risk proportional 
hazard models. Overall survival (OS) in patients with SPM was compared using 
Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 579,608 patients met inclusion criteria, and 51.8% of the 
cohort was treated with RT. The 10- and 20-year cumulative incidences of 
competing risk (IPTW adjusted) of SPMs were 1.9% (95%CI = 1.8-1.9%) and 3.6% 
(95%CI = 3.4-3.7%) after RP vs. 2.7% (95%CI = 2.6-2.8%) and 5.4%(95%CI = 
5.3-5.6%) after RT. IPTW-adjusted competing risk hazard ratio (HR) of SPM after 
RT compared to RP was increased in the entire cohort (HR 1.46; 95%CI = 
1.39-1.53, P < 0.001) and was highest in the youngest patients: Age <55 HR = 
1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49-2.24, P<0.001), Age 55 to 64 HR = 1.66 
(95%CI = 1.54-1.79, P < 0.001), Age 65-74 HR = 1.41 (95%CI = 1.33-1.48, P < 
0.001), Age ≥75 HR = 1.14 (95%CI = 0.97-1.35, P = 0.112). At 10 years, 
SPM-specific mortality occurred in 28.9% of patients treated with RT, though OS 
with SPM was worse in the youngest patients: Age <55 HR = 1.88 (95%CI = 
1.25-2.81, P = 0.002), Age 55-64 HR = 1.60 (95%CI = 1.42-1.81, P < 0.001), Age 
65-74 HR = 1.40 (95%CI = 1.30-1.52, P < 0.001), Age ≥ 75 HR = 1.27 (95%CI = 
1.06-1.53, P = 0.009). All of the age categories had similar median follow-up 
times.
CONCLUSION: At 10 years there is a 1.8% increased incidence of SPM after RT 
compared to RP, of which <30% of RT-treated patients with an SPM die as a result 
of a SPM. However, the risk of SPMs was greatest among younger men treated with 
RT for localized CaP, and this relationship could not be explained solely by 
follow-up time, latency time, or life expectancy. An improved understanding of 
those at the highest risk of SPMs may help tailor treatment and surveillance 
strategies.

INTRODUCCIÓN: La histiocitosis de células de Langerhans (HCL) es un trastorno 
histiocítico raro y su incidencia exacta se mantiene desconocida; se ha 
diagnosticado en todos los grupos de edad, pero es más común en los primeros 3 
años de vida. Se caracteriza por lesiones únicas o múltiples de tipo osteolítico 
causadas por proliferación clonal de células histológicamente similares a las 
células de Langerhans; su presentación clínica es heterogénea.
CASO CLÍNICO: Presentamos el caso de una paciente de sexo femenino de 7 años, 
con dificultad para la marcha y debilidad progresiva en los miembros inferiores 
de 5 días de evolución. A la exploración física presenta hallazgos concordantes 
con síndrome piramidal e hipoestesias de miembros inferiores. Se realizó 
resonancia magnética (RM) de columna y tomografía computarizada de cráneo 
simple, que descartó patología intracraneal. En la RM de columna se detectó 
vertebra plana con extensión epidural y paravertebral, por lo que se inició 
manejo con esteroides y se indicó descompresión quirúrgica. Se realizó resección 
parcial y biopsia de la lesión. Debido a los hallazgos histológicos y la 
presencia de marcadores positivos para CD1a y CD207, se confirmó el diagnóstico 
de HCL.
CONCLUSIONES: La HCL es una enfermedad poco frecuente y de difícil diagnóstico 
por su presentación heterogénea. El granuloma eosinofílico y la vértebra plana 
como hallazgos imagenológicos pueden orientar el diagnóstico, aunque siempre se 
debe confirmar histológicamente.
BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, more common 
in the first three years of life. It is characterized by single or multiple 
osteolytic lesions due to clonal proliferation of cells histologically similar 
to Langerhans cells; its clinical presentation is heterogeneous.
CASE REPORT: 7-year-old female patient with 5 days of progressive lower 
extremity weakness and difficulty to walk. Physical exam findings were 
consistent with pyramidal syndrome and lower extremities hypoesthesia. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of spine and cranial computed tomography (CT) were 
performed. Intracranial pathology was ruled out. The MRI findings showed 
vertebra plana with epidural and paravertebral involvement, so treatment with 
steroids and surgical decompression initiated. Partial resection and biopsy of 
the lesion was performed. Due to histological findings and positive CD1a and 
CD207 markers, diagnosis of LCH was confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: LCH is an uncommon disease with a challenging diagnosis due to its 
heterogeneous clinical presentation. Eosinophilic granuloma and vertebra plana 
as imaging findings may guide the diagnosis. However, it should always be 
confirmed with histological evidence.

Investigación Operativa en Epidemiología, Ciudad de México, México.

INTRODUCCIÓN: En México, el cáncer de ovario representa 5.3 % de los 
diagnósticos de cáncer en todos los grupos de edad y 21 % de los cánceres 
ginecológicos; en las últimas tres décadas ha tenido un aumento constante.
OBJETIVO: Determinar la tendencia de la mortalidad por cáncer de ovario y los 
años potenciales de vida perdidos (APVP) por estado y región socioeconómica de 
México entre 2000 y 2014.
MÉTODO: Se obtuvieron los registros de cáncer de ovario del Instituto Nacional 
de Estadística y Geografía. Se identificaron los códigos de la CIE-10 
correspondientes a la causa básica de defunción por cáncer de ovario. Se 
calcularon las tasas de mortalidad y las tasas de APVP a nivel nacional, por 
estado y región socioeconómica.
RESULTADOS: Entre 2000 y 2014, las tasas ajustadas por edad por 100 000 mujeres 
se incrementaron de 3.3 a 4.1. Las mayores tasas de mortalidad se identificaron 
en la región 7, en Chihuahua, Baja California Sur, Colima, Quintana Roo, 
Zacatecas, Sonora, Coahuila, Aguascalientes, Querétaro. La mayor tasa de APVP 
por cáncer de ovario se registró en las regiones 7, 5 y 6, en Nayarit, Baja 
California Sur, Zacatecas, Colima, Tlaxcala, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Coahuila, 
Aguascalientes y Querétaro.
CONCLUSIONES: La región socioeconómica 7 de México presentó las mayores tasas de 
APVP y de mortalidad por cáncer de ovario.
INTRODUCTION: In Mexico, ovarian cancer accounting for 5.3% of cancer diagnoses 
in all age groups and 21% of gynecological cancers and it has had a steady 
increase in the last three decades.
OBJECTIVE: To determine mortality trends from ovarian cancer and potential years 
of life lost (PYLL) by state and socioeconomic region of Mexico between 2000 and 
2014.
METHOD: Records of ovarian cancer were obtained from the National Institute of 
Statistics and Geography. ICD-10 codes corresponding to ovarian cancer as the 
basic cause of death were identified. Mortality rates and YPLL rates were 
calculated by nationwide, states and socioeconomic region.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2014, age-adjusted rates per 100,000 women increased 
from 3.3 to 4.1. The highest mortality rates were identified in region 7, in 
Chihuahua, Baja California Sur, Colima, Quintana Roo, Zacatecas, Sonora, 
Coahuila, Aguascalientes and Queretaro. The highest rates of PYLL due to ovarian 
cancer were recorded in regions 7, 5 and 6, Nayarit, Baja California Sur, 
Zacatecas, Colima, Tlaxcala, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Coahuila, Aguascalientes and 
Queretaro.
CONCLUSIONS: Mexico’s socioeconomic region 7 had the highest rates of PYLL and 
mortality from ovarian cancer.

BACKGROUND: Throughout life, physiological homeostasis is challenged and the 
capacity to cope with such challenges declines with increasing age. In many 
species, sex differences exist in life expectancy. Sex-specific differences have 
been related to extrinsic factors like mate competition and/or intrinsic 
proximate mechanisms such as hormonal changes. In humans, an intrinsic factor 
related to aging is soluble alpha klotho (α-Kl). Both sexes show an age-related 
decline in α-Kl, but throughout life women have higher levels than men of the 
same age. Sex differences in α-Kl have been linked to a shorter lifespan, as 
well as to specific morbidity factors such as atherosclerosis and arteries 
calcifications. In non-human animals, information on α-Kl levels is rare and 
restricted to experimental work. Our cross-sectional study is the first on α-Kl 
levels in two long-lived species: bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan 
troglodytes). As in most mammals, female bonobos and chimpanzees have longer 
life expectancy than males.
METHODS: We measured serum α-Kl levels of 140 subjects from 16 zoos with an 
ELISA to examine if α-Kl levels reflect this difference in life expectancy.
RESULTS: In both species and in both sexes, α-Kl levels declined with age 
suggesting that this marker has potential for aging studies beyond humans. We 
also found species-specific differences. Adult female bonobos had higher α-Kl 
levels than males, a difference that corresponds to the pattern found in humans. 
In chimpanzees, we found the opposite: males had higher α-Kl levels than 
females.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that contrasting sex differences in adult α-Kl levels 
mirror the dominance relations between females and males of the two Pan species; 
and that this might be related to corresponding sex differences in their 
exposure to stress. In humans, higher cortisol levels were found to be related 
to lower α-Kl levels. We conclude that there is great potential for studying 
aging processes in hominoids, and perhaps also in other non-human primates, by 
measuring α-Kl levels. To better understand the causes for sex differences in 
this aging marker, consideration of behavioural parameters such as competition 
and stress exposure will be required as well as other physiological markers.

Conflict of interest statement: Serum samples used in this study were taken by 
veterinarians whenever apes were anaesthetized for management reasons. 
Therefore, all samples are fasting samples, comparable to samples in human 
studies [77]. Only samples from animals anaesthetized for transfer or health 
check were included. The respective zoo authorities approved all sample 
collection, and no ape was anaesthetized for the purpose of this study. Sample 
collection was approved by zoo authorities under the different regulations of 
Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Portugal, and United Kingdom, the different 
countries involved in the study. Measuring α-Kl in urine was not feasible 
because testing urine samples for measures of α-Kl levels revealed that urinary 
α-Kl is not stable [104–106]. Furthermore, urine samples stored at − 80 °C 
and – 20 °C degrade when exposed to room temperature or after repeated 
freeze-thaw cycles [107], emphasizing that urine samples are not an alternative 
source for assessing α-Kl levels.Not applicable.The authors declare that they

INTRODUCTION: Trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) are currently reimbursed for 
subjects aged ≥ 65 years and children between 6 and 59 months of age under a 
national immunization program in South Korea. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines 
(QIVs) are expected to address the potential problem of influenza B-lineage 
mismatch for TIVs.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to compare the cost effectiveness 
of QIV versus TIV in children aged 6-59 months and older adults ≥ 65 years of 
age in South Korea.
METHODS: A 1-year static population model was employed to compare the costs and 
outcomes of a QIV vaccination program compared with TIV in children aged 
6-59 months and older adults ≥ 65 years of age in South Korea. Influenza-related 
parameters (probabilities, health resource use, and costs) were derived from an 
analysis of the National Health Insurance System claims database between 2010 
and 2013 under a broad and narrow set of International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes used to identify influenza. Other inputs 
were extracted from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(2016 South Korean Won [KRW] per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) were 
estimated using a 'limited' societal perspective as per the Korean 
pharmacoeconomic guidelines. QALYs lost due to premature mortality were 
discounted at 5% annually.
RESULTS: For both age groups combined, under the narrow definition of influenza, 
QIV is expected to prevent nearly 16,000 (2923 in children and 13,011 in older 
adults) medically attended influenza cases, nearly 8000 (672 in children, 7048 
in older adults) cases of complications, and over 230 (0 in children, 238 in 
older adults) deaths annually compared with TIV. The impact of using QIV versus 
TIV in this setting translates into savings of KRW 24 billion (KRW 0.6 billion 
in children, KRW 23.4 billion in older adults) in annual medical costs, and over 
2100 (18 in children, 2084 in older adults) QALYs. Under the broad definition, 
the corresponding results are over 190,000 (50,697 in children, 140,644 in older 
adults) influenza cases, over 37,000 (12,623 in children, 24,526 in older 
adults) complications, 270 deaths (0 in children, 270 in older adults), KRW 
94.22 billion (KRW 16 billion in children, KRW 78.2 billion in older adults), 
and over 3500 QALYs saved (316 in children, 3260 in older adults).
CONCLUSION: The use of QIV over TIV was estimated to not be cost effective in 
children 6-59 months of age, but cost saving in older adults, using the narrow 
definition of influenza; however, QIV use was cost saving in both age groups 
using the broad definition. QIV is expected to yield more benefits in older 
adults ≥ 65 years of age than in children aged 6-59 months due to higher 
influenza-related mortality and costs among the older adults. Further analyses 
considering the indirect effects of influenza vaccination in children are 
required.

Outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have improved through use of 
novel treatments, especially lenalidomide combined with autologous stem cell 
transplantation. However, because of their increased life expectancy, an 
increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) has been observed in MM 
patients, particularly after lenalidomide maintenance in both 
transplant-eligible (TE) and transplant-ineligible (TI) patients. To evaluate 
the incidence and risk factors of developing SPMs, we identified 17 TE-MM and 12 
TI-MM patients with SPMs among 211 TE-MM and 280 TI-MM patients, including seven 
TE-MM and four TI-MM patients with hematological malignancies and ten TE-MM and 
eight TI-MM patients with non-hematological cancers, respectively. The median 
follow-up time from diagnosis was > 4 years. Multivariate analysis identified a 
history of high-dose cyclophosphamide use for peripheral blood stem cell harvest 
in TE-MM patients and > 65 years of age at diagnosis, or a history of 
adriamycin, lenalidomide, or thalidomide use in TI-MM patients as independent 
risk factors for SPMs (P < 0.001). Patients with a history of lenalidomide use 
had a lower risk of death among both TE-MM (P = 0.0326) and TI-MM (P < 0.001) 
patients. The survival benefit of receiving lenalidomide outweighed the 
increased risk of SPMs in both TE-and TI-MM patients.

PURPOSE: Septorhinoplasty is a common procedure performed in rhinology and 
facial plastic surgery. Despite this, the health benefits associated with the 
procedure remain controversial. In this study, a health utility assessment of 
patients undergoing septorhinoplasty was performed. Health gains associated with 
the procedure, and the cost at which they were acquired, were also determined.
METHODS: Sixty-seven patients undergoing septorhinoplasty at a German 
tertiary-level hospital were included in the study. Study participants completed 
the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and satisfaction questionnaires before and 12 months 
after septorhinoplasty. The Short Form six-dimensional (SF-6D) instrument was 
used to acquire quality-adjusted life year (QALY) values from SF-36 responses, 
thus allowing estimation of pre- and post-operative health utilities. Health 
utility gains after septorhinoplasty were determined and combined with cost data 
to estimate cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing septorhinoplasty reported mean pre-operative health 
utility values of 0.70 pre-operatively and 0.74 post-operatively resulting in 
health gains of 0.04 QALYs. Patients satisfied with their procedures had 
significant health utility gains, while dissatisfied patients did not experience 
any significant gains. The cost of septorhinoplasty to statutory health 
insurance was €3487.69. When compared to the baseline, the incremental utility 
ratio for septorhinoplasty was €94,797.30 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully estimated the health utilities and gains 
associated with septorhinoplasty. The findings indicate that the procedure has 
associated health gains but at a high cost-utility ratio. These values provide a 
reference point for further much-needed economic evaluations.

While there have been significant advances in the medical treatment of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH), life expectancy, and quality of life remain reduced 
in this disease. Strenuous exercise may be hazardous for PAH patients; however, 
several relatively small trials have confirmed that exercise training programs 
can be used safely and effectively as adjunctive treatment for selected 
patients. The use of exercise training is now recommended in consensus 
international PAH treatment algorithms; however, there is no published guideline 
detailing how this intervention should be carried out. Areas covered: This 
review describes the evidence available and evaluates its applicability to 'real 
life' clinical practice. The limitations of current evidence are acknowledged, 
and we discuss how the existing data can be applied to management of PAH 
patients in Australia, New Zealand, and countries with similar healthcare 
systems. Recommendations for PAH exercise training are proposed including 
patient selection, program structure and duration, training modalities, training 
intensity, supervision, monitoring, safety precautions, and outcome assessments. 
Expert commentary: It is recognized that knowledge gaps remain and further 
research is required into physiological mechanisms associated with improved 
exercise capacity, optimal outpatient exercise regimen, durability of benefit, 
and whether there is any disease-modifying effect or impact on long-term 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: At present, the number of older people is growing, especially in the 
developed countries where the living conditions enable a longer life expectancy. 
However, the higher age may result in the aging diseases such as dementia out 
which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent. Nevertheless, to maintain 
them both physically and mentally active, more assistance is required.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to discuss the efficacy of the use of 
modern information technologies, especially computer-based training programs, on 
people with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
RESULTS: Although the results from the selected studies do not indicate that the 
computer-based training programs are effective in the delay of cognitive decline 
is concerned, they suggest that these computerbased training programs are at 
least appropriate for the improvement of their behavioural symptoms and 
progression of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Generally, these technological devices may contribute to the 
reduction of patients´ and their caregivers´ costs and certain flexibility, and 
thus the improvement of the quality of their life.

Quality of care for frail older adults.

Moore K(1).

London,London,UK.

Our successes in improving life expectancy has led to increased years of life 
lived with multimorbidity and dementia with increased support needs. Much of the 
support given to frail older people is provided by family and informal support 
networks with significant impact on their physical, psychological, and financial 
well-being. Demographic and societal changes are reducing the capacity of family 
to offer this care. Formal home-based, center-based, and 
long-term/residential/nursing home care services are predominately provided by 
untrained care staff working under supervision from nursing staff. Difficulties 
recruiting and retaining these staff is leading to major challenges to meeting 
the needs of older people (Chenoweth et al., 2010). This volume contains a 
number of studies focusing on ways to improve care provided by these services 
for frail older people. The approach underpinning these papers and many 
perspectives of good quality care for older people is the need to be 
person-centered where the older person identifies their own goals for care and 
assessment of need, employing a holistic and strength-based approach 
incorporating their interests, values, and capacities (Vernooij-Dassen and 
Moniz-Cook, 2016).

In Africa, about 33 000 cases of obstetric fistula occur each year. Women with 
fistula experience debilitating incontinence of urine and/or faeces and are 
often socially ostracized. Worldwide, Uganda ranks third among countries with 
the highest burden of obstetric fistula. Obstetric fistula repair competes for 
scarce resources with other healthcare interventions in resource-limited 
settings, even though it is surgically efficacious. There is limited 
documentation of its cost-effectiveness in the most affected settings. We 
therefore sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention for 
obstetric fistula in Uganda so as to provide appropriate data for policy-makers 
to prioritize fistula repair and reduce women's suffering in similarly burdened 
countries. We built a decision-analytic model from the perspective of Uganda's 
National Health System to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vesico-vaginal and 
recto-vaginal fistula surgery vs a competing strategy of no surgery for Ugandan 
women with fistula. Long-term disability outcomes were assessed based on a 
lifetime Markov state-transition cohort and effectiveness of surgery. Surgical 
costs were estimated by micro-costing local Ugandan health resources. Disability 
weights associated with vesico-vaginal, recto-vaginal fistula and mortality 
rates among the general population in Uganda were based on published sources. 
The cost of providing fistula repair surgery in Uganda was estimated at $378 per 
procedure. For a hypothetical 20-year-old woman, surgery was estimated to 
decrease the lifetime disability burden from 8.53 DALYs to 1.51 DALYs, yielding 
a cost per DALY averted of $54. The results were robust to variations in model 
inputs in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Surgery for obstetric 
fistula appears highly cost-effective in Uganda. In similar low-income 
countries, governments and non-governmental organizations need to prioritize 
training and strengthening surgical capacity to increase access to fistula 
surgical care, which would be an important step towards achieving universal 
health coverage.

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating disorder affecting not only more 
than 10% of all women giving birth, but also the baby, the family, and the 
society. Compiling evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in the 
pathophysiology of major depression; yet, the immune response in perinatal 
depression is not as well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
alterations in peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 169 Swedish women 
with and without depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal 
depression scale or the M.I.N.I neuropsychiatric interview at eight weeks 
postpartum. Among the 70 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension 
assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive 
symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis: Tumor necrosis 
factor ligand superfamily member (TRANCE) (OR-per 1 SD increase = 1.20), 
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (OR = 1.17) Interleukin (IL)-18 (OR = 1.06), 
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) (OR = 1.25), and C-X-C motif chemokine 1 
(CXCL1) (OR 1.11). These results indicate that women with PPD have elevated 
levels of some inflammatory biomarkers. It is, therefore, plausible that PPD is 
associated with a compromised adaptability of the immune system.

Temporal variation in environmental conditions affects population growth 
directly via its impact on vital rates, and indirectly through induced variation 
in demographic structure and phenotypic trait distributions. We currently know 
very little about how these processes jointly mediate population responses to 
their environment. To address this gap, we develop a general transient life 
table response experiment (LTRE) which partitions the contributions to 
population growth arising from variation in (1) survival and reproduction, (2) 
demographic structure, (3) trait values and (4) climatic drivers. We apply the 
LTRE to a population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) to 
demonstrate the impact of demographic and trait-mediated processes. Our analysis 
provides a new perspective on demographic buffering, which may be a more subtle 
phenomena than is currently assumed. The new LTRE framework presents 
opportunities to improve our understanding of how trait variation influences 
population dynamics and adaptation in stochastic environments.

OBJECTIVE: Metastatic pleural effusion (MPE) is one of the most frequent causes 
of pleural effusion. The aims of the therapeutic management are palliation of 
symptoms and improvement in patient's quality of life. The first step is a 
therapeutic thoracentesis. In case of a recurrent MPE, pleural maneuvers can be 
used to manage symptoms based on either ambulatory pleural drainage or 
pleurodesis to prevent fluid accumulation. The aim of this review is to describe 
recent advances, according to the best available evidence, in the field of 
pleurodesis for the management of MPE.
DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: Three different searches of the most clinically 
relevant articles and up-to-date results in the field of pleurodesis for the 
management of MPE were performed using PubMed. Different indexing terms and time 
restriction were chosen. From these PubMed searches, 322 articles were 
respectively found. After cross-checking these three lists and the selection of 
articles published after January 2010 specially dedicated to the management of 
MPE by pleurodesis, the abstracts of 106 articles were extracted to feed the 
corpus of this review.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Treatment approaches of recurrent MPE should take into 
account multiple factors in particular patient's life expectancy and preference. 
If talc is the best sclerosing agent alone or in combination with indwelling 
pleural catheter which is a promising strategy, the pathophysiology of MPE has 
to be revisited in order to propose a personalized management targeting 
intrapleural key molecules involved in the genesis of malignant process.

Sickle cell disease (SCD), first discovered in West Africa is an autosomal 
recessive hemoglobin disorder, predominantly affecting persons of African, 
Mediterranean, Indian, and Middle Eastern descent. It results from the 
replacement of glutamate for valine at the sixth amino acid of the beta-globin 
chain. The mutation results in hemoglobin S (HbS) tetramers that accumulate 
during tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress or dehydration. The accumulation leads 
to red blood cell sickling, early destruction of erythrocytes, and widespread 
vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC), subsequently resulting in multiorgan damage. Some 
of the renal complications, collectively known as sickle cell nephropathy (SCN), 
include hematuria, hyposthenuria, renal papillary necrosis, proteinuria, renal 
tubular disorders, acute and chronic kidney injury, sickle cell glomerulopathy, 
and renal medullary carcinoma. Clinically significant renal involvement occurs 
more frequently in sickle cell disease than in sickle cell trait or in combined 
hemoglobinopathies, except renal medullary carcinoma, which appears to be more 
common among sickle cell trait patients.  Natural history of SCD is highly 
variable with reduced life expectancy with multiorgan damage in symptomatic 
patients. In general, all patients have a reduced lifespan. Median survival in 
the United States and Jamaica is 45 to 55 years.  Natural history by age in SCD 
is as follows: Newborn babies are asymptomatic for an initial couple of months, 
given fetal Hb (HbF) predominance. Early childhood is characterized by episodes 
of dactylitis, acute chest syndrome (ACS), sepsis, splenic sequestration, and 
stroke. Human parvovirus B19 infection can lead to severe and sudden anemia in 
children and adolescents with SCD as the virus destroys precursors of the red 
blood cells. After age 5: Classic painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which
