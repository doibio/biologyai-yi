The prognosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including primary myelofibrosis 
(PMF), polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia varies considerably, 
between these disorders as well as within each diagnosis. Molecular studies have 
identified "driver mutations" in JAK2, MPL1, and CALR and additional somatic DNA 
mutations, including ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2, and SRSF2, that affect prognosis 
differentially. Patients with mutations in CALR (type1) have a better outlook 
than patients with mutations in JAK2 or MPL, whereas patients without any of the 
driver mutations (triple negative) have the shortest life expectancy. Mutations 
in ASXL1, EZH2, and SRSF2 may be associated with shortened survival, and IDH 
mutations carry a higher risk of leukemic transformation. The combination and 
number of mutations are more important than a given single mutation. Mutations 
also appear to impact the outcome of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 
currently the only treatment with curative potential. Based on available data, 
the best post-HCT outcome is observed with CALR mutations. Triple negativity has 
a negative impact. The data on JAK2 are controversial. Mutations in ASXL1 or 
IDH1/2 reduce the probability of progression-free survival after HCT, although 
the impact of ASXL1 differs between patients with primary and secondary 
myelofibrosis. Although it is not clear to what extent HCT can overcome the 
risks associated with a given mutational pattern, at present, early HCT should 
be considered in triple-negative patients and patients with PMF who harbor 
mutations in ASXL1. Mutations in EZH2, SRSF2, or IDH, particularly if combined 
with other mutations, should also lead to consideration of HCT. Further studies 
are needed to validate the present observations and determine the impact of 
additional mutations that have been identified.

We test whether income inequality undermines female and male life expectancy in 
the United States. We employ data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia 
and two-way fixed effects to model state-level average life expectancy as a 
function of multiple income inequality measures and time-varying 
characteristics. We find that state-level income inequality is inversely 
associated with female and male life expectancy. We observe this general pattern 
across four measures of income inequality and under the rigorous conditions of 
state-specific and year-specific fixed effects. If income inequality undermines 
life expectancy, redistribution policies could actually improve the health of 
states.

The primary goal of cancer screening is early detection of cancer to reduce 
cancer-specific mortality and morbidity. The benefits of screening in older 
adults are uncertain due to paucity of evidence. Extrapolating data from younger 
populations, evidence suggests that the benefit occurs years later from the time 
of initial screening and therefore may not be applicable in those older adults 
with limited life expectancy. Contrast this with the harms of screening, which 
are more immediate and increase with age and comorbidities. An individualized 
approach to cancer screening takes these factors into consideration, allowing 
for thoughtful decision making for older adults.

Evidence for preventive screening and therapeutic intervention for primary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease is limited for older adults. In this 
article, we review screening and prevention strategies, including lifestyle, 
modifiable risk factors, and medications, that may be considered in older 
adults, with a focus on those ≥75 years, accounting for age, frailty and 
functional status, medical conditions, and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: A maternal group B streptococcal (GBS) vaccine could prevent 
neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Its cost-effectiveness in low-income sub-Saharan 
Africa, a high burden region, is unknown.
METHODS: We used a decision tree model, with Markov nodes to project infants' 
lifetimes, to compare maternal immunization delivered through routine antenatal 
care with no immunization. 37 countries were clustered on the basis of economic 
and health resources and past public health performance. Vaccine efficacy for 
covered serotypes was ranged from 50% to 90%. The model projected EOGBS 
(early-onset) and LOGBS (late-onset) cases and deaths, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), healthcare costs (2014 US$), and cost-effectiveness for a 
representative country in each of the four clusters: Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, 
Nigeria, and Ghana. Maximum vaccination costs/dose were estimated to meet two 
cost-effectiveness benchmarks, 0.5 GDP and GDP per capita/DALY, for ranges of 
disease incidence (reported and adjusted for under-reporting) and vaccine 
efficacy.
RESULTS: At coverage equal to the proportion of pregnant women with≥4 antenatal 
visits (ANC4) and serotype-specific vaccine efficacy of 70%, maternal GBS 
immunization would prevent one-third of GBS cases and deaths in Uganda and 
Nigeria, where ANC4 is 50%, 42-43% in Guinea-Bissau (ANC4=65%), and 55-57% in 
Ghana (ANC4=87%). At a vaccination cost of $7/dose, maternal immunization would 
cost $320-$350/DALY averted in Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, and Ghana, less than half 
these countries' GDP per capita. In Uganda, which has the lowest case fatality 
ratios, the cost would be $573/DALY. If the vaccine prevents a small proportion 
of stillbirths, it would be even more cost-effective. Vaccination cost/dose, 
disease incidence, and case fatality were key drivers of cost/DALY in 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Maternal GBS immunization could be a cost-effective intervention in 
low-income sub-Saharan Africa, with cost-effectiveness ratios similar to other 
recently introduced vaccines. The vaccination cost at which introduction is 
cost-effective depends on disease incidence and vaccine efficacy. Clinical Trial 
registry name and registration number: Not applicable.

PURPOSE: Data on the incidence, mortality and burden of prostate cancer as well 
as changing trends are necessary to provide policy makers with the evidence 
needed to allocate resources appropriately. This study presents estimates of 
prostate cancer incidence, mortality and burden from 1990 to 2015 by patient 
age, country and developmental status using the results of the Global Burden of 
Disease 2015 study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from vital registration systems and cancer 
registries were used to generate mortality estimates. Cause specific mortality 
served as the basis for estimating incidence, prevalence and disability adjusted 
life years. The global number of incident cases, deaths and disability adjusted 
life years attributable to prostate cancer are reported as well as age 
standardized rates.
RESULTS: Incident cases of prostate cancer increased 3.7-fold from 1990 to 2015. 
The age standardized incidence rate also increased 1.7-fold during the study 
period and in 2015 it reached 56.71/100,000 person-years (95% uncertainty 
interval 45.86-78.45). Global estimates of the age standardized death rate 
decreased slightly to 14.24 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 11.8-17.95) per 
100,000 person-years in 2015. The decline in the age standardized death rate was 
more prominent in high income countries. Disability adjusted life years 
attributable to prostate cancer increased by 90% during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The prostate cancer mortality rate is decreasing in high income 
countries. However, the incidence and burden of disease are steadily increasing 
globally, resulting in further challenges in the allocation of limited health 
care resources. The current study provides comprehensive knowledge of the local 
burden of disease and help with appropriate allocation of resources for prostate 
cancer prevention, screening and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Terminally ill patients are at high risk of pressure ulcers, which 
have a negative impact on quality of life. Data about pressure ulcers' 
prevalence, incidence and associated factors are largely insufficient.
AIM: To document the point prevalence at admission and the cumulative incidence 
of pressure ulcers in terminally ill patients admitted to an Italian home 
palliative care unit, and to analyse the patients' and caregivers' 
characteristics associated with their occurrence.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients ( n = 574) with a life expectancy ⩽6 months 
admitted to a palliative home care service were included in this study.
RESULTS: The prevalence and incidence rates were 13.1% and 13.0%, respectively. 
The logistic regression models showed body mass index ( p < 0.001), Braden score 
at risk ( p < 0.001), Karnofsky Performance Scale index <30 ( p < 0.001), 
patients' female gender, patients' age >70 and >1 caregiver at home as the 
dichotomous variables predictors of presenting with a pressure ulcer at time of 
admission and during home palliative care.
CONCLUSION: The notable pressure ulcers' incidence and prevalence rates suggest 
the need to include this issue among the main outcomes to pursue during home 
palliative care. The accuracy of body mass index, Braden Scale and Karnofsky 
Performance Scale in predicting the pressure ulcers risk is confirmed. 
Therefore, they appear as essential tools, in combination with nurses' clinical 
judgment, for a structured approach to pressure ulcers prevention. Further 
research is needed to explore the home caregivers' characteristics and attitudes 
associated with the occurrence of pressure ulcers and the relations between 
their strategies for pressure ulcer prevention and gender-related patient's 
needs.

[Telomeres and diet quality].

[Article in Spanish]

BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relationship between diet quality and 
telomere integrity in humans. Telomeres are regions of non-coding DNA localized 
at the end of each chromosome whose length, in addition to indicating life 
expectancy, indicates an overall health status. The objective of this systematic 
review is to compile the existing evidence on the relationship between telomere 
length and diet quality to further explore the impact that some nutrients, foods 
and dietary patterns may have on telomere homeostasis and therefore, in 
precision nutrition strategies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A bibliographic review was performed in the PubMed 
database to identify published articles (in English or Spanish) until December 
2016 that met the following criteria: included human subjects; cross-sectional 
studies; case-control studies; prospective cohort studies or intervention 
studies; evaluating the relationship of nutrients, foods or dietary patterns on 
telomere integrity. The search strategy included the following keywords: 
nutrients or food OR food groups OR diet OR dietary pattern OR eating pattern OR 
dietary habits OR diet type AND telomere attrition OR telomere length. In total, 
19 cross-sectional studies, five case-control studies, five prospective cohort 
studies, and two intervention studies were included, including those articles 
that were found for being listed in other publications.
RESULTS: Positive associations were found between telomere length and adherence 
to the Mediterranean diet and consumption of vegetables and fruits. The results 
observed for other nutrients, foods or dietary patterns were incoherent although 
it seems that processed meats, cereals, alcohol and sweetened beverages could be 
associated with shorter telomeres.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intervention, and in particular the promotion of a 
Mediterranean-style diet, may play a role in the protection of telomere 
integrity.

There is no doubt that family carers who look after a family member with 
dementia or with a functional mental illness fulfill an important role, not only 
for their loved one, but also for the health and aged care systems of the 
countries they live in. Due to increasing life expectancy, but also improved 
healthcare the number of family carers supporting older care recipients with 
functional mental illness or dementia is on the rise. While the carer role often 
can offer rewarding experiences caregivers are at increased risk of stress, 
depression, sleep problems, and often experience poor health outcomes with 
increased morbidity and mortality (Oyebode, 2003). Next to the stressors 
directly associated with the carer role, they often do not have the time to 
engage in healthy behavior to protect their physical, mental, and cognitive 
health (Loi et al., 2014). There is a wealth of literature providing evidence 
about effective strategies to support carers and the recent Lancet Commission on 
Dementia prevention, intervention, and care highlighted the importance of 
exploring how the use of technological innovations could support carers better 
(Livingston et al., 2017). The use of modern technology in this context can mean 
a variety of approaches, such as internet-based programs to provide education 
and skill-building, virtual support to assist with monitoring and managing 
challenging behavior, online support groups, and the use of assistive or 
therapeutic technology to improve safety, enable positive activities, and 
support communication between carer and care recipient, to name just a few 
(D'Onofrio et al., 2017; Ienca et al., 2017; Livingston et al., 2017). More 
specifically, telehealth approaches via videoconferences have the potential to 
better support carers who live in rural or remote regions (O'Connell et al., 
2014) or who cannot attend face-to-face support programs for other reasons such 
as inability to leave the care recipient alone at home, being a multiple carer 
or having a disability themselves to give just some examples.

Abel and Kruger (2010) found that the smile intensity of professional baseball 
players who were active in 1952, as coded from photographs, predicted these 
players' longevity. In the current investigation, we sought to replicate this 
result and to extend the initial analyses. We analyzed (a) a sample that was 
almost identical to the one from Abel and Kruger's study using the same database 
and inclusion criteria ( N = 224), (b) a considerably larger nonoverlapping 
sample consisting of other players from the same cohort ( N = 527), and (c) all 
players in the database ( N = 13,530 valid cases). Like Abel and Kruger, we 
relied on categorical smile codings as indicators of positive affectivity, yet 
we supplemented these codings with subjective ratings of joy intensity and 
automatic codings of positive affectivity made by computer programs. In both 
samples and for all three indicators, we found that positive affectivity did not 
predict mortality once birth year was controlled as a covariate.

BACKGROUND: The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak massively hit Guinea. The coastal 
districts of Boffa, Dubreka and Forecariah, three major foci of Human African 
Trypanosomiasis (HAT), were particularly affected. We aimed to assess the impact 
of this epidemic on sleeping sickness screening and caring activities.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used preexisting data from the Guinean 
sleeping sickness control program, collected between 2012 and 2015. We described 
monthly: the number of persons (i) screened actively; (ii) or passively; (iii) 
treated for HAT; (iv) attending post-treatment follow-up visits. We compared 
clinical data, treatment characteristics and Disability Adjusted Life-Years 
(DALYs) before (February 2012 to December 2013) and during (January 2014 to 
October 2015) the Ebola outbreak period according to available data. Whereas 
32,221 persons were actively screened from February 2012 to December 2013, 
before the official declaration of the first Ebola case in Guinea, no active 
screening campaigns could be performed during the Ebola outbreak. Following the 
reinforcement and extension of HAT passive surveillance system early in 2014, 
the number of persons tested passively by month increased from 7 to 286 between 
April and September 2014 and then abruptly decreased to 180 until January 2015 
and to none after March 2015. 213 patients initiated HAT treatment, 154 (72%) 
before Ebola and 59 (28%) during the Ebola outbreak. Those initiating HAT 
therapy during Ebola outbreak were recruited through passive screening and 
diagnosed at a later stage 2 of the disease (96% vs. 55% before Ebola, 
p<0.0001). The proportion of patients attending the 3 months and 6 months 
post-treatment follow-up visits decreased from 44% to 10% (p <0.0001) and from 
16% to 3% (p = 0.017) respectively. The DALYs generated before the Ebola 
outbreak were estimated to 48.7 (46.7-51.5) and increased up to 168.7 
(162.7-174.7), 284.9 (277.1-292.8) and 466.3 (455.7-477.0) during Ebola assuming 
case fatality rates of 2%, 5% and 10% respectively among under-reported HAT 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak deeply impacted HAT 
screening activities in Guinea. Active screening campaigns were stopped. Passive 
screening dramatically decreased during the Ebola period, but trends could not 
be compared with pre-Ebola period (data not available). Few patients were 
diagnosed with more advanced HAT during the Ebola period and retention rates in 
follow-up were lowered. The drop in newly diagnosed HAT cases during Ebola 
epidemic is unlikely due to a fall in HAT incidence. Even if we were unable to 
demonstrate it directly, it is much more probably the consequence of hampered 
screening activities and of the fear of the population on subsequent 
confirmation and linkage to care. Reinforced program monitoring, alternative 
control strategies and sustainable financial and human resources allocation are 
mandatory during post Ebola period to reduce HAT burden in Guinea.

BACKGROUND: HIV epidemic remains a major global health issue. Data from 
cost-effectiveness analyses base on CD4+ count and morbidity in patients with 
symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV infection. The approach adopted in these 
analyses includes many other factors, previously not investigated. Additionally, 
we evaluate the impact of sexual HIV transmission due to delayed cART on the 
cost-effectiveness of care.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model (1-month cycle) was developed to estimate the 
cost per quality adjusted life years (QALY) for a 1- and 3-year delay in 
starting cART (as compared to starting immediately at linkage to care) lifetime 
costs, clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Patients were categorized into 
having asymptomatic HIV, AIDS, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and non-AIDS defining 
condition. Mortality rates and utility values were obtained from published 
literature. The number of new infected persons was estimated on the basis of 
sexual orientation, the number of sexual partners per year, the number of sex 
acts per month, frequency of condom use and use of cART. For the input Test and 
Keep in Care (TAK) project cohort data were used. Costs of care, cART and 
potential life-years lost were based on estimated total costs and the difference 
in expected QALY gained between an HIV-positive and an average person in Polish 
population. Costs were based on real expenditures of the Ministry of Health, 
National Health Fund, available studies and experts' opinion. Costs and effects 
were discounted at rates of 5% and 3.5%, respectively.
RESULTS: Input data were available for 141 patients form TAK cohort. The 
estimated number of new HIV infections in low, medium and high risk transmission 
groups were 0.28, 0.61, 2.07 with 1 and 0.82, 1.80, 6.11 with a 3-year delay, 
respectively. This reflected QALY loss due to cART delay of 0.52, 1.13, 3.84 and 
2.02, 4.43, 15.03 for a 1- and 3-year delay, respectively. If additional costs 
of treatment and potential life-years lost due to new HIV infections were not 
taken into account, initiating cART immediately at linkage to care was not 
cost-saving irrespective of cART delay. Otherwise, when additional costs and 
QALY lost due to new HIV infections were included, immediate cART initiation was 
cost-saving regardless of the chosen scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: If new HIV infections are not taken into account, then starting 
cART immediately does not dominate comparing to delaying cART. When taking into 
account HIV transmission in cost-effectiveness analysis, immediate initiation of 
HIV treatment is a profitable decision from the public payer's perspective.

The origins of life bring into stark relief the inadequacy of our current 
synthesis of thermodynamic, chemical, physical and information theory to predict 
the conditions under which complex, living states of organic matter can arise. 
Origins research has traditionally proceeded under an array of implicit or 
explicit guiding principles in lieu of a universal formalism for abiogenesis. 
Within the framework of a new guiding principle for prebiotic chemistry called 
subsumed complexity, organic compounds are viewed as by-products of energy 
transduction phenomena at different scales (subatomic, atomic, molecular and 
polymeric) that retain energy in the form of bonds that inhibit energy from 
reaching the ground state. There is evidence for an emergent level of complexity 
that is overlooked in most conceptualizations of abiogenesis that arises from 
populations of compounds formed from atomic energy input. We posit that 
different forms of energy input can exhibit different degrees of dissipation 
complexity within an identical chemical medium. By extension, the maximum 
capacity for organic chemical complexification across molecular and 
macromolecular scales subsumes, rather than emerges from, the underlying 
complexity of energy transduction processes that drive their production and 
modification.This article is part of the themed issue 'Reconceptualizing the 
origins of life'.

Computational techniques are required for narrowing down the vast space of 
possibilities to plausible prebiotic scenarios, because precise information on 
the molecular composition, the dominant reaction chemistry and the conditions 
for that era are scarce. The exploration of large chemical reaction networks is 
a central aspect in this endeavour. While quantum chemical methods can 
accurately predict the structures and reactivities of small molecules, they are 
not efficient enough to cope with large-scale reaction systems. The 
formalization of chemical reactions as graph grammars provides a generative 
system, well grounded in category theory, at the right level of abstraction for 
the analysis of large and complex reaction networks. An extension of the basic 
formalism into the realm of integer hyperflows allows for the identification of 
complex reaction patterns, such as autocatalysis, in large reaction networks 
using optimization techniques.This article is part of the themed issue 
'Reconceptualizing the origins of life'.

SIRT1 is the most evolutionarily conserved mammalian sirtuin, and it plays a 
vital role in the regulation of metabolism, stress responses, genome stability, 
and ageing. As a stress sensor, SIRT1 deacetylase activity is significantly 
increased during stresses, but the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully clear. 
Here, we show that SIRT1 is dynamically modified with O-GlcNAc at Ser 549 in its 
carboxy-terminal region, which directly increases its deacetylase activity both 
in vitro and in vivo. The O-GlcNAcylation of SIRT1 is elevated during genotoxic, 
oxidative, and metabolic stress stimuli in cellular and mouse models, thereby 
increasing SIRT1 deacetylase activity and protecting cells from stress-induced 
apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism for the activation of SIRT1 
under stress conditions and suggest a novel potential therapeutic target for 
preventing age-related diseases and extending healthspan.

Many genera of terrestrial vertebrates diversified exclusively on one or the 
other side of Wallace's Line, which lies between Borneo and Sulawesi islands in 
Southeast Asia, and demarcates one of the sharpest biogeographic transition 
zones in the world. Macaque monkeys are unusual among vertebrate genera in that 
they are distributed on both sides of Wallace's Line, raising the question of 
whether dispersal across this barrier was an evolutionary one-off or a more 
protracted exchange-and if the latter, what were the genomic consequences. To 
explore the nature of speciation over the edge of this biogeographic divide, we 
used genomic data to test for evidence of gene flow between macaque species 
across Wallace's Line after macaques colonized Sulawesi. We recovered evidence 
of post-colonization gene flow, most prominently on the X chromosome. These 
results are consistent with the proposal that gene flow is a pervasive component 
of speciation-even when barriers to gene flow seem almost insurmountable.

There has been an overall increase in pelvic organ prolapse due to demographic 
changes (increased life expectancy). Increasing sociocultural demands of women 
require treatments that are more effective with methods that are more 
successful. In the treatment of pelvic floor insufficiency and uterovaginal 
prolapse, pelvic floor reconstructions with mesh implants have proven to be 
superior to conventional methods such as the classic colporrhaphy, 
reconstructions with biomaterial, and native tissue repair in appropriately 
selected patients and when applying exact operation techniques, especially 
because of good long-term results and low recurrence rates. When making 
a systematic therapy plan, one should adhere to certain steps, for example, 
a pelvic floor reconstruction should be undertaken before performing the 
corrective procedure for incontinence. The approach, if vaginal, laparoscopic, 
or abdominal should be chosen wisely, taking into consideration the required 
space of action, in such a way that none or only minimal collateral damage 
related to the operation occurs. The use of instrumental suturing techniques and 
operation robots are advantageous in the case of difficult approaches and 
limited anatomical spaces. In principle, the surgeon who implants meshes should 
be able to explant them! The surgical concept of mesh-related interventions in 
the pelvis must meet established rules. "Implant as little mesh as possible and 
only as much suitable (!) mesh as absolutely necessary!" In the case of apical 
direct fixations, a therapeutically relevant target variable is the elevation 
angle of vagina (EAV). Established anatomical fixation points are preferable. 
A safe distance between implants and vulnerable tissue is to be maintained. 
Mesh-based prolapse repairs are indicated in recurrences, in primary situations, 
in combined defects of the anterior compartment, in central defects of 
multimorbid and elderly patients, and above all, when organ preservation is 
wanted. Native connective tissue structures are to be preserved, strengthened 
and reconstructed to restore altered functions. Practical skills for highly 
specialized mesh-based operations as well as effective techniques for 
complication management should be taught in interdisciplinary specialist 
courses.

Florida, Orlando, FL.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest major cancers, 
with a five year survival rate of less than 8%. With current therapies only 
giving rise to modest life extension, new approaches are desperately needed. 
Even though targeting polyamine metabolism is a proven anticancer strategy, 
there are no reports, which thoroughly survey the literature describing the role 
of polyamine biosynthesis and transport in PDAC. This review seeks to fill this 
void by describing what is currently known about polyamine metabolism in PDAC 
and identifies new targets and opportunities to treat this disease. Due to the 
pleiotropic effects that polyamines play in cells, this review covers diverse 
areas ranging from polyamine metabolism (biosynthesis, catabolism and 
transport), as well as the potential role of polyamines in desmoplasia, 
autophagy and immune privilege. Understanding these diverse roles provides the 
opportunity to design new therapies to treat this deadly cancer via polyamine 
depletion.

Culturally congruent dietary patterns have evolved with geographic and societal 
traditions and can be traced as far back as pre-Hellenistic Greece. Today, the 
modern Mediterranean diet (MDiet) is recognized internationally as an 
anti-obesogenic cardioprotective dietary model consisting of plant-based foods 
native to the Mediterranean basin, fish, olive oil, and an active lifestyle. 
With the assumption that obesity and heart disease rates adversely affected life 
expectancy, the MDiet was identified by Dr Ancel Keys as a primary 
characteristic among people-groups largely immune to these trends. Following 
extensive research on how food quality affected human performance, Keys 
engineered the largest ecologic investigation of dietary habits and their 
effects on heart disease and longevity known as the Seven Countries Study. A new 
understanding of how regionally and culturally specific diets affected entire 
populations led to the introduction of the MDiet to the global public health 
community. This historiographic portrait of Dr Keys describes his humble 
beginnings, highlights critical points in his career, discusses his seminal 
research into diet and culture as protective agents, and details his legacy as 
the pioneer of the modern MDiet.

[Schistosomiasis and pulmonary hypertension].

[Article in Turkish]

Center, Baskent University, Adana Turkey.

Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevelant parazitic diseases in the world. It 
is endemic in more than 70 countries, and more than 200 million people worldwide 
are infected with Schistosoma. Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is one of the 
chronic complications of schistosomiasis. The exact pathogenesis of 
schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary hypertension (S-PHT) remains unclear, 
although several mechanisms such as parazitic arterial embolisation, pulmonary 
arteriopathy, and portopulmonary hypertension have been suggested. Pathological 
pulmonary vascular changes in S-PHT were found similar to those in idiopathic 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). The fact that schistosomiasis is one of 
the most common causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), particularly in 
the developing countries, underlines the importance of enhancing our knowledge 
on this disease. Developments in the treatment of PAH have resulted in improved 
prognosis and significant increase in life expectancy and quality of life in the 
last two decades, which has enhanced the importance of S-PHT. Schistosomiasis is 
treated with praziquantel. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence that this 
treatment is effective for PHT. Although antihelmintic medications do not lead 
to significant improvement, they have beneficial effects and may slow down 
disease progression. Using PAH-specific treatments in the patients with 
schistosomiasis-associated PAH (S-PAH) can improve prognosis. However, 
inadequate clinical studies and limited sources in the endemic regions restrict 
extensive usage of these expensive medications. Further studies are required to 
determine the efficacy of these treatment modalities.

The Risk of Cancer Might be Lower Than We Think. Alternatives to Lifetime Risk 
Estimates.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of lifetime cancer risk are commonly used in the clinical 
setting and in health-care evaluations. These measures are based on lifetime 
cancer risk estimates and may create an unrealistically frightening perception 
of cancer risk for an individual. We suggest using two new measures of cancer 
risk to complement the cancer lifetime risk measure, namely estimates of cancer 
risk from birth to a specific age or from a specific age to life expectancy.
METHODS: We calculated risks using incidence density data from the Israel 
National Cancer Registry of 2013, applying a well-known formula for calculating 
risk, for a follow-up time. The joint disease-free survival probability is 
calculated for several age intervals, and hence the risk (i.e. 1-survival) for 
the intervals.
RESULTS: The risk of cancer to age 80 in Jewish men and women, respectively, 
ranged from about 0.336 and 0.329 at age 0, to 0.279 and 0.237 at age 60. The 
risk of cancer from birth up to an age in Jewish men and women, respectively, 
ranged from 0 and 0 at birth to 0.088 and 0.129 at age 60. The risk of cancer to 
age 80 in Arab men and women, respectively, ranged from 0.298 and 0.235 at age 0 
to 0.249 and 0.161 at age 60. The risk of cancer from birth up to an age in Arab 
men and women, respectively, ranged from 0 and 0 at age 0 to 0.074 and 0.095 at 
age 60. In Jewish and Arab women, breast cancer risk to age 80 decreased from 
about 0.127 in Jewish women at age 40 to 0.079 at age 60 and from 0.080 to 0.043 
in Arab women; the risk from birth up to a specific age ranged between 0 and 
0.056, and 0 and 0.040, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The two proposed new estimates convey important additional 
information to patients and physicians. These estimates are considerably lower 
than the frequently quoted 33% lifetime cancer risk and are more relevant to 
patients and physicians. Similarly, breast cancer risk estimates up to or from a 
specific age differ considerably from the frequently quoted lifetime risk 
estimates of 1 in 8 women.
