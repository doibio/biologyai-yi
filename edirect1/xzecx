the effects on physiological and bioche-mical properties of P. notoginseng, we 
conducted foliar spraying of propiconazole on P. notoginseng in pot experiments. 
The physiolo-gical and biochemical properties studied included leaf damage, 
osmoregulatory substance content, antioxidant enzyme system, non-enzymatic 
system, and saponin content in the main root. The results showed that at the 
same application concentration, the residual amount of propiconazole in each 
part of P. notoginseng increased with the increase in the times of application 
and decreased with the extension of harvest interval. After one-time application 
of propiconazole according to the recommended dose(132 g·hm~(-2)) for P. 
ginseng, the half-life was 11.37-13.67 days. After 1-2 times of application in 
P. notoginseng, propiconazole had a low risk of dietary intake and safety threat 
to the population. The propiconazole treatment at the recommended concentration 
and above significantly increased the malondialdehyde(MDA) content, relative 
conductivity, and osmoregulatory substances and caused the accumulation of 
reactive oxygen species in P. notoginseng leaves. The propiconazole treatment at 
half(66 g·hm~(-2)) of the recommended dose for P. ginseng significantly 
increased the activities of superoxide dismutase(SOD), peroxidase(POD), and 
catalase(CAT) in P. notoginseng leaves. The propiconazole treatment at 132 
g·hm~(-2) above inhibited the activities of glutathione reductase(GR) and 
glutathione S-transferase(GST), thereby reducing glutathione(GSH) content. 
Proconazole treatment changed the proportion of 5 main saponins in the main root 
of P. notoginseng. The treatment with 66 g·hm~(-2) propiconazole promoted the 
accumulation of saponins, while that with 132 g·hm~(-2) and above propiconazole 
significantly inhibited the accumulation of saponins. In summary, using 
propiconazole at 132 g·hm~(-2) to prevent and treat P. notoginseng diseases will 
cause stress on P. notoginseng, while propiconazole treatment at 66 g·hm~(-2) 
will not cause stress on P. notoginseng but promote the accumulation of 
saponins. The effect of propiconazole on P. notoginseng diseases remains to be 
studied.

INTRODUCTION: The condition of refractory lupus nephritis (LN) negatively 
affects the prognosis and life expectancy of the patients, posing a challenge to 
manage in clinical. This interventional study evaluated the efficacy as well as 
safety of leflunomide in patients with refractory LN.
METHODS: Twenty patients with refractory LN were enrolled in this study. A daily 
dose of 20-40 mg of leflunomide was given to the patients orally. Meanwhile, 
immunosuppressives were withdrawn, and corticosteroids were gradually tapered. 
There was an average follow-up period of 3, 6, and 12 months for most patients 
while some were observed for as long as 24 months. We recorded biochemical 
parameters and side effects. We calculated the response rate using 
intention-to-treat analysis.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (90%) completed the study. At 3 months, 80% (16/20) 
of the patients achieved more than a 25% decrease in 24-hour urine protein 
quantity. At 6 months, three patients (15%) achieved a partial response, and 
five patients (25%) achieved a complete response. However, by 12 months and 24 
months, the complete response rate dropped to 15% and 20%, respectively. The 
objective responses were 30% (6/20), 40% (8/20), 40% (8/20), and 30% (6/20) at 
3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Two patients withdrew from the study due 
to developing cytopenia and leucopenia.
CONCLUSION: In patients diagnosed with refractory LN, our study shows that 
leflunomide could be a promising treatment option owing to its response rate and 
safety profile.

Periprosthetic fractures of the distal femur have significant morbidity in both 
total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA, respectively). The incidence 
of these fractures is growing, with the predominant mechanism of injury being a 
fall from a standing height and therefore considered fragility fractures. In 
many countries, improved public funding and a flourishing private health care 
sector, when coupled with increased life expectancy, translates to more older 
patients receiving both TKA and THA and therefore an increased prevalence of 
periprosthetic fractures and their associated complications. These fractures may 
occur below a long stem THA, above a TKA, or between the two (so-called 
"interprosthetic fracture"). We will outline fracture classification, risk 
factors, diagnosis, and treatment options, highlighting perspectives on treating 
these fractures in Israel, South Africa, and South Sudan. These countries 
represent differing access to resources, varied comorbidity factors, and 
differing health care systems. The points of difference and the points of 
similarity will be considered.

PURPOSE: To investigate the impacts of sensory impairments (SIs) including 
single vision impairment (SVI), single hearing impairment (SHI) and dual sensory 
impairment (DSI) on subjective wellbeing measurements including life expectancy 
(LE), life satisfaction (LS) and self-rated health (SRH) in middle-aged and 
older Chinese population.
METHODS: We obtained data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal 
Survey (CHARLS). In total, 9,293 Chinese middle-aged and older adults aging over 
45 were included at baseline 2011 in this study, and 3,932 participants who 
accomplished all 4 interviews from 2011 to 2018 were adapted for longitudinal 
analyses. Sensory status and subjective wellbeing measurements were collected. 
Other covariates included socio-demographic characteristics, medical condition 
and lifestyle-related factors. The impacts of baseline sensory status on LE, LS 
and SRH were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses. A linear regression analysis with generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) was used to assess the association between time-varying sensory statuses 
with LE, LS and SRH over 8 years after being adjusted with multi-confounding 
factors.
RESULTS: Participants with SIs had significantly lower level of LE, LS, and SRH, 
compared to those who were free of SI. All kinds of SIs were significantly 
associated with LE, LS, and SRH according to cross-sectional data. The 
correlations between SIs and LE or SRH over 8 years were also noticed. However, 
only SHI and DSI were found to be significantly associated with LS according to 
longitudinal data (all p values < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Sensory impairments had explicitly detrimental effects on subjective 
wellbeing status over time among middle-aged and older Chinese population.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial to 
estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a rehabilitation 
intervention following neck dissection (ND) after head and neck cancer (HNC).
DESIGN: Two-arm, open, pragmatic, parallel, multicentre, randomised controlled 
feasibility trial.
SETTING: Two UK NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: People who had HNC in whom a ND was part of their care. We 
excluded those with a life expectancy of six months or less, pre-existing, 
long-term neurological disease affecting the shoulder and cognitive impairment.
INTERVENTION: Usual care (standard care supplemented with a booklet on 
postoperative self-management) was received by all participants. The GRRAND 
intervention programme consisted of usual care plus up to six individual 
physiotherapy sessions including neck and shoulder range of motion and 
progressive resistance exercises, advice and education. Between sessions, 
participants were advised to complete a home exercise programme.
RANDOMISATION: 1:1 randomisation. Allocation was based on minimisation, 
stratified by hospital site and spinal accessory nerve sacrifice. It was not 
possible to mask treatment received.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: Participant recruitment, retention and fidelity 
to the study protocol and interventions from study participants and staff at six 
months post-randomisation (and 12 months for those reaching that time-point). 
Secondary: clinical measures of pain, function, physical performance, 
health-related quality of life, health utilisation and adverse events.
RESULTS: 36 participants were recruited and enrolled. The study achieved five of 
its six feasibility targets. These included consent - 70% of eligible 
participants were consented; intervention fidelity - 78% participants discharged 
completed the intervention sessions; contamination - none - no participants in 
the control arm received the GRRAND-F intervention and retention - 8% of 
participants were lost to follow-up. The only feasibility target that was not 
achieved was the recruitment target where only 36 of the planned 60 participants 
were recruited over 18 months. This was principally due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
which caused all research activity to be paused or reduced, with a subsequent 
reduction in.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings a full-trial can now be designed to better 
understand whether this proposed intervention is effective.

INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has greatly improved the 
prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), improving the 
survival expectancy of patients with chronic phase (CP) CML to that of the 
general population. However, despite these advances, nearly 50% of patients with 
CP CML experience failure to respond to frontline therapy, and most fail to 
respond to the subsequent second-line TKI. Treatment guidelines for patients 
failing second-line therapy are lacking. This study aimed to determine the 
efficacy of TKIs as third-line therapy in a "real-world" clinical practice 
setting and identify factors favorably influencing the long-term outcomes of 
therapy.
METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 100 patients 
with CP CML.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 51 (range, 21-88) years, and 36% of 
the patients were men. The median duration of the third-line TKI therapy was 22 
(range, 1- 147) months. Overall, the rate of achieving complete cytogenetic 
response (CCyR) was 35%. Among the four patient groups with different levels of 
responses at baseline, the best results were achieved in the groups with any CyR 
at the baseline of third-line therapy. Thus, СCyR was reached in all 15 and 8/ 
16 (50%) patients with partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) or minimal or minor 
CyR (mmCyR), respectively, whereas CCyR was detected only in 12/69 (17%) 
patients without any CyR at baseline (p < 0.001). Univariate regression analysis 
revealed that the factors negatively associated with CCyR achievement in 
thirdline TKI therapy were the absence of any CyR on first- or second-line TKI 
therapy (p < 0.001), absence of CHR prior to third-line TKI (p = 0.003), and 
absence of any CyR prior to third-line TKI (p < 0.001). During the median 
observation time from treatment initiation to the last visit [56 (4-180) 
months], 27% of cases progressed into accelerated phase or blast phase CML, and 
32% of patients died.
DISCUSSION: Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 
significantly higher in patients with CCyR on third-line than in the group 
without CCyR on third-line therapy. At the last visit, third-line TKI therapy 
was ongoing in 18% of patients, with a median time of treatment exposure of 58 
(range, 6-140) months; 83% of these patients had stable and durable CCyR, 
suggesting that patients without CHR at baseline and without CCyR at least by 12 
months on third-line TKI should be candidates for allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation, third-generation TKIs, or experimental therapies.

BACKGROUND: Malignancies are generally considered a risk factor for deep vein 
thrombosis and may hamper the recanalisation of thrombosed veins.
AIM: We investigate whether the natural course and response to anticoagulant 
treatment of bland portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis 
complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differ from those without HCC.
METHODS: Retrospective study in two hepatology referral centres, in Italy and 
Romania where patients with a diagnosis of PVT on cirrhosis and follow-up of at 
least 3 months with repeated imaging were included.
RESULTS: A total of 162 patients with PVT and matching inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were identified: 30 with HCC were compared to 132 without HCC. 
Etiologies, Child-Pugh Score (7 vs 7) and MELD scores (11 vs 12, p=0.3679) did 
not differ. Anticoagulation was administered to 43% HCC vs 42% nonHCC. The 
extension of PVT in the main portal trunk was similar: partial/total involvement 
was 73.3/6.7% in HCC vs 67.4/6.1% in nonHCC, p=0.760. The remainder had 
intrahepatic PVT. The recanalization rate was 61.5% and 60.7% in HCC/nonHCC in 
anticoagulated patients (p=1). Overall PVT recanalisation, including treated and 
untreated patients, was observed in 30% of HCC vs 37.9% of nonHCC, p=0.530. 
Major bleeding incidence was almost identical (3.3% vs 3.8%, p=1). Progression 
of PVT after stopping anticoagulation did not differ (10% vs 15.9%, 
respectively, HCC/nHCC, p=0.109).
CONCLUSION: The course of bland non-malignant PVT in cirrhosis is not affected 
by the presence of active HCC. Treatment with anticoagulation in patients with 
active HCC is safe and as effective as in nonHCC patients, this can potentially 
allow us to use otherwise contraindicated therapies (ie TACE) if a complete 
recanalization is achieved with anticoagulation.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition that limits the 
quality of life and life expectancy. The predicted mortality at 1 year is 
estimated at 30-40% without treatment. Of the types of PAH, chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is most amenable to treatment and 
guidelines recommend pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) surgery for 'operable' 
patients (where disease is found in the proximal pulmonary vessels). 
Traditionally these patients were referred to a European centre with the 
complexities of international travel, pre- and post-operative care, and funding. 
We sought to establish a national PEA programme to serve the Bulgarian 
population and avoid some of the problems of international healthcare.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A total of 11 patients underwent PEA in 2 cardiac centres in 
Bulgaria (Acibadem Hospital and Government Hospital Lozenetz Sofia). The age of 
patients ranged from 22 to 80. The preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR) ranged from 309 to 1,906 dynes/sec/cm-5. For the surviving patients the 
average PVR reduction was 615 dynes/sec/cm-5 at 6 months, the average intensive 
care unit (ICU) stay 6.7 days, and hospitalisation 15.2 days. Nine out of 11 
patients survived to hospital discharge and 6 months follow, all with normalised 
PVR and exercise tolerance.
CONCLUSIONS: We present our results of initial experience with PEA in Bulgaria 
with encouraging results. Our work shows that inter-European relationship for 
healthcare can be productive and offer safe treatment on local level.

Persons with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) make up a vulnerable 
group within mental healthcare and society. Not only do they suffer from 
long-term, serious psychiatric disorders; they often also experience 
considerable problems in their psychosocial functioning. Research has disclosed 
that the care needs of this target group are complex, and that the life 
expectancy of these persons is significantly lower than in the general 
population. Given (1) the lower life expectancy of persons with SPMI, (2) the 
higher suicide risk related to mental disorders, and (3) the legalization and 
practice of medical assistance in dying in an increasing number of countries, it 
is of utmost importance to map the ethical aspects and challenges of end-of-life 
care needs in persons with SPMI. Therefore, we charted the way end-of-life care 
is provided for them by means of a scoping review of the scientific literature, 
with an emphasis on the ethical aspects surrounding it. We explore existing 
ethical dilemmas; the underlying ethical values, principles and attitudes; and 
the locus and stakeholders of ethical dialog regarding end-of-life care in 
persons with SPMI. The results indicate that the four guiding principles of 
biomedical ethics can well be identified in the literature, and are each 
addressed in their own specific way: Autonomy in relation to questions regarding 
the decision-making capacity of persons with SPMI; Justice in relation to access 
to quality care and the presence of stigma; and Non-maleficence and Beneficence 
in relation to the ongoing debate regarding the benefits and obstacles in 
applying palliative care approaches in the context of psychiatry, and the status 
of the futility-concept therein. Personal virtues and attitudes in care 
professionals, like compassion, non-abandonment and upholding dignity are key, 
as care professionals are the main advocates of persons with SPMI, which often 
lack an extensive social network. Further, we find that the ethical dialog is 
mainly focused on care professionals and relatives, rather than the persons with 
SPMI themselves. This is reflected in the existing research that often had the 
voices of the latter missing. Future research may benefit from the inclusion of 
persons with SMPI's first-hand accounts. End-of-life care for persons with SPMI 
may benefit from identifying and integrating (locally developed) good practices 
like cross-sectoral education, specific care models, and ethics support.

Medulloblastoma (MB) is considered the commonest malignant brain tumor in 
children. Multimodal treatments consisting of surgery, radiation, and 
chemotherapy have improved patients' survival. Nevertheless, the recurrence 
occurs in 30% of cases. The persistent mortality rates, the failure of current 
therapies to extend life expectancy, and the serious complications of 
non-targeted cytotoxic treatment indicate the need for more refined therapeutic 
approaches. Most MBs originating from the neurons of external granular layer 
line the outer surface of neocerebellum and responsible for the afferent and 
efferent connections. Recently, MBs have been segregated into four molecular 
subgroups: Wingless-activated (WNT-MB) (Group 1); Sonic-hedgehog-activated 
(SHH-MB) (Group 2); Group 3 and 4 MBs. These molecular alterations follow 
specific gene mutations and disease-risk stratifications. The current treatment 
protocols and ongoing clinical trials against these molecular subgroups are 
still using common chemotherapeutic agents by which their efficacy have improved 
the progression-free survival but did not change the overall survival. However, 
the need to explore new therapies targeting specific receptors in MB 
microenvironment became essential. The immune microenvironment of MBs consists 
of distinctive cellular heterogeneities including immune cells and none-immune 
cells. Tumour associate macrophage and tumour infiltrating lymphocyte are 
considered the main principal cells in tumour microenvironment, and their role 
are still under investigation. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of 
interaction between MB cells and immune cells in the microenvironment, with an 
overview of the recent investigations and clinical trials.

There is a critical need for novel therapies to treat patients with advanced 
biliary tract cancer (BTC). This systematic review summarizes the evidence-based 
knowledge for the potential role of PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in the 
treatment of patients with early-stage and advanced BTC. An Embase database 
search was conducted, identifying 15 eligible phase II/III clinical trials for 
review. Results from recent phase III trials show a statistically significant 
overall survival (OS) benefit from the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to 
chemotherapy in the first-line management of advanced BTC. Future research 
should concentrate on the discovery of biomarkers to identify patients who would 
benefit most from these therapies.

Plain Language Summary: The majority of patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) 
present with advanced disease (disease that has spread) that cannot be cured. 
The current mainstay of treatment for advanced BTC is chemotherapy, which aims 
to prolong life expectancy to just under 12 months. The need for new, more 
effective treatments for advanced BTC is crucial. This systematic review 
summarizes the most recent clinical trials that have tested the use of newer 
drugs called immunotherapy (PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) in the 
treatment of both early-stage and advanced BTC. Fifteen clinical trials have 
been included, each testing different immunotherapy drugs either alone or in 
combination with other anti-cancer treatments. Promising results from larger 
trials, have given hope for longer survival in patients with advanced BTC when 
treated with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy as their first-line treatment 
after diagnosis. However, further investigation is required to determine 
whether certain patients might benefit more than others and if immunotherapy 
drugs can also be given to patients at an earlier or later stage of their 
disease.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is defined as "a group of congenital 
conditions characterized by joint contractures in two or more body areas." Given 
its heterogeneity, the definition of AMC has changed multiple times. This 
scoping review provides an overview of how AMC is defined in scientific 
publications, on existing knowledge and trends regarding the concept of AMC. Our 
review illuminates possible knowledge gaps and provides directions for future 
research. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews guidelines. Quantitative studies on AMC from 1995 to date were included. 
We summarized information about definitions/descriptions of AMC, study 
objectives, study designs, methods, funding, and involvement of patient 
organizations. A total of 2729 references were screened, and 141 articles 
fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Our scoping revealed that the majority of 
publications were cross-sectional or retrospective studies of children and young 
people, commonly about orthopedic management. Explicit or good definitions of 
AMC were provided in 86% of the cases. Recent publications on AMC mostly used 
consensus-based definitions. The research gaps were primarily related to adults, 
aging, etiology, and new medical treatment, in addition to implications on daily 
life.

A low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals 
(CNCs) with an encapsulated bioactive formulation (cinnamon essential 
oil + silver nanoparticles) was developed for preservation of fresh 
strawberries. Antimicrobial activity of the active LDPE films was tested against 
Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Aspergillus niger, and 
Penicillium chrysogenum by agar volatilization assay. The optimal condition of 
the films showed ≥75% inhibitory capacity against the tested microbes. 
Strawberries were stored with different types of films: Group 1 (control): 
(LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol), Group 2: (LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol + AGPPH silver 
nanoparticles), Group 3: (LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol + cinnamon), Group 4: 
(LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol + active formulation), and Group 5: 
(LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol + active formulation + 0.5 kGy γ-radiation) at 4°C for 
12 days. Weight loss (WL) (%), decay (%), firmness (N), color, and total 
phenolics and anthocyanin content of the strawberries were measured. Results 
showed that the most effective LDPE-nanocomposite film for reducing the 
microbial growth was LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol + active formulation film (Group 4). 
When combined with γ-irradiation (0.5 kGy), the LDPE + CNCs + Glycerol + active 
formulation (Group 5) significantly reduced both decay and WL by 94%, as 
compared to the control samples after 12 days of storage. Total phenols (from 
952 to 1711 mg/kg) and anthocyanin content (from 185 to 287 mg/kg) increased 
with storage time under the different treatments. The mechanical properties, 
water vapor permeability (WVP), and surface color of the films were also tested. 
Though the WVP of the films were not influenced by the types of antimicrobial 
agents, they did significantly (p ≤ 0.05) change color and mechanical properties 
of the films. Therefore, combined treatment of active film and γ-irradiation has 
potential as an alternative method for extending the shelf-life of storage 
strawberries while maintaining fruit quality. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Bioactive 
Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) nanocomposite film was developed in the study by 
incorporating active formulation (essential oil and silver nanoparticle) to 
extend the shelf life of stored strawberries. The bioactive LDPE-based 
nanocomposite film along with γ-irradiation could be used to preserve fruits for 
long-term storage by controlling the growth of foodborne pathogenic bacteria and 
spoilage fungi.

WHAT IS THIS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY ABOUT? This summary explains the results of 
a long-term extension study on the effects of a specific medicine. A long-term 
extension study allows people who have already completed a research study to 
continue taking treatment. Researchers can then look at how a treatment works 
over a long period of time. This extension study looked at the effects of a 
medicine called ARRY-371797 (also known as PF-07265803) in people with dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM for short) caused by a faulty lamin A/C gene (also known as 
the LMNA gene). This condition is called LMNA-related DCM. In people with 
LMNA-related DCM, the heart muscle becomes thinner and weaker than normal. This 
can lead to heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around 
the body. The extension study allowed people who had completed an earlier 
48-week study to continue taking ARRY-371797 for another 96 weeks (around 
22 months).
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE EXTENSION STUDY? 8 people joined the extension 
study and continued with the dose of ARRY-371797 that they had taken in the 
first study. This means that people could have taken ARRY-371797 continuously 
for up to 144 weeks (around 2 years and 9 months). Using the 6-minute walk test 
(6MWT for short), researchers regularly checked people taking ARRY-371797 to see 
how far they could walk. Throughout the extension study, people were able to 
walk further than they could before they started taking ARRY-371797. This 
suggests that people could maintain the improvements in their ability to do 
daily activities with long-term ARRY-371797 treatment. Researchers also looked 
at how severe people's heart failure was by using a test that measures levels of 
a biomarker called NT-proBNP. A biomarker is something found in the body that 
can be measured to indicate the extent of a disease. Throughout this study, the 
levels of NT-proBNP in people's blood was lower than before they started taking 
ARRY-371797. This suggests that they maintained stable heart function. Using the 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ for short), researchers asked 
people about their quality of life, and if they experienced any side effects. A 
side effect is something that people feel while taking a treatment. Researchers 
evaluate if a side effect is related to the treatment or not. Some improvement 
in KCCQ response during the study was seen, although results were varied. There 
were no serious side effects that were considered related to treatment with 
ARRY-371797.
WHAT DO THE RESULTS OF THE EXTENSION STUDY MEAN? Researchers found that the 
improvements in functional capacity and heart function seen with ARRY-371797 
treatment in the original study were maintained with long-term treatment. Larger 
studies are needed to determine if ARRY-371797 could be an effective treatment 
for people with LMNA-related DCM. One such study (called REALM-DCM) was started 
in 2018 but ended early, as it was unlikely to show a clear treatment benefit of 
ARRY-371797. Phase 2 long-term extension study (NCT02351856) Phase 2 study 
(NCT02057341) Phase 3 REALM-DCM study (NCT03439514).

We aimed to investigate the influence of 4-wk of fish oil (FO) supplementation 
on markers of muscle damage, inflammation, muscle soreness, and muscle function 
during acute recovery from eccentric exercise in moderately trained males. 
Sixteen moderately-trained males ingested 5 g/d of FO (n = 8) or soybean oil 
(placebo) capsules (n = 8) for 4-wk prior to- and 3-d following an acute 
eccentric exercise bout. Eccentric exercise consisted of 12 sets of isokinetic 
knee extension and knee flexion. Indices of muscle damage, soreness, function 
and inflammation were measured at baseline and during exercise recovery. 
Eccentric exercise elicited an increase in muscle soreness (p < 0.010) and thigh 
volume (p < 0.001), and reduced peak isometric torque by 31.7 ± 6.9%, (p < 0.05, 
95% CI 10.6-52.8) during 3-d of recovery. Blood omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acid concentration was 14.9 ± 2.4% higher in FO than PLA (p < 0.01, 95% CI 
9.8-20.1). However, FO did not ameliorate the cumulative creatine kinase 
response (expressed as AUC; p = 0.368), inflammation (p = 0.400), muscle 
soreness (p > 0.140), or muscle function (p > 0.249) following eccentric 
exercise. FO supplementation confers no clear benefit in terms of ameliorating 
the degree of muscle damage, or facilitating the muscle repair process, during 
acute eccentric exercise recovery. These data suggest that FO supplementation 
does not provide an effective nutritional strategy to promote exercise recovery, 
at least in moderately-trained young men.Abbreviations: ANOVA: Analysis of

properties of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, alongside their propensity to 
incorporate into the muscle phospholipid membrane underpins the idea that fish 
oil supplementation may attenuate muscle damage and promote muscle repair 
following eccentric-based exercise.Four weeks of high-dose (5 g/d) fish oil 
supplementation prior to eccentric exercise failed to attenuate the rise in 
creatine kinase concentration and muscle soreness during acute exercise recovery 
in physically-active young men.Future studies are warranted to investigate the 
efficacy of combining omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with other nutrients 
(i.e. protein/amino acids) for the promotion of muscle recovery following 
eccentric-based damaging exercise.

IMPORTANCE: The benefits from colorectal cancer (CRC) screening may take 10 to 
15 years to accrue. Therefore, screening is recommended for older adults who are 
in good health.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the number of screening colonoscopies done in patients 
older than 75 years with a life expectancy of fewer than 10 years, diagnostic 
yield, and associated adverse events within 10 days and 30 days of the 
procedure.
DESIGN: This cross-sectional study with a nested cohort between January 2009 and 
January 2022 in an integrated health system assessed asymptomatic patients older 
than 75 years who underwent screening colonoscopy in the outpatient setting. 
Reports with incomplete data, any indication other than screening, patients who 
had a colonoscopy within the previous 5 years, and patients with a personal 
history of inflammatory bowel disease or CRC were excluded.
EXPOSURES: Life expectancy based on a prediction model from previous literature.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percentage of screened 
patients who had limited (<10 years) life expectancy. Other outcomes included 
colonoscopy findings and adverse events that developed within 10 days and 30 
days of the procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 7067 patients older than 75 years were included. The median 
(IQR) age was 78 (77-79) years, 3967 (56%) were women, and 5431 (77%) were White 
with an average of 2 comorbidities (taken from a select group of comorbidities). 
The proportion of colonoscopies performed on patients with a life expectancy of 
fewer than 10 years aged 76 to 80 years was 30% in both sexes and increased with 
age-82% of men and 61% of women aged 81 to 85 years (71% total), and 100% of 
patients beyond the age of 85 years. Adverse events requiring hospitalizations 
were common at 10 days (13.58 per 1000) and increased with age, particularly 
among patients older than 85 years. The detection of advanced neoplasia varied 
from 5.4% among patients aged 76 to 80 years to 6.2% in those aged 81 to 85 
years and 9.5% among patients older than 85 years (P = .02). Of the total 
population, 15 patients (0.2%) had invasive adenocarcinoma; among patients with 
a life expectancy of fewer than 10 years, 1 of 9 was treated, whereas 4 of 6 
patients with a life expectancy of greater than or equal to 10 years were 
treated.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study with a nested cohort, 
most screening colonoscopies performed in patients older than 75 years were in 
patients with limited life expectancy and associated with increased risk of 
complications. Colorectal cancer was exceedingly rare.

Prominent voices have called for a better way to measure, predict, and adjust 
for social factors in healthcare and population health. Local area 
characteristics are sometimes framed as a proxy for patient characteristics, but 
they are often independently associated with health outcomes. We have developed 
an “artificially intelligent” approach to risk adjustment for local social 
determinants of health (SDoH) using random forest models to understand life 
expectancy at the Census tract level. Our Local Social Inequity score draws on 
more than 150 neighborhood-level variables across 10 SDoH domains. As piloted in 
Ohio, the score explains 73 percent of the variation in life expectancy by 
Census tract, with a mean squared error of 4.47 years. Accurate 
multidimensional, cross-sector, small-area social risk scores could be useful in 
understanding the impact of healthcare innovations, payment models, and SDoH 
interventions in communities at higher risk for serious illnesses and diseases; 
identifying neighborhoods and areas at highest risk of poor outcomes for better 
targeting of interventions and resources; and accounting for factors outside of 
providers’ control for more fair and equitable performance/quality measurement 
and reimbursement.
