at 7 month follow-up, while on HAART for WHO (World Health Organisation) stage 
IV disease. The dynamics of HIV-related immunosuppression has an impact on the 
clinical course of SSPE. Contrary to reported cases of fulminant progression, a 
classic presentation with slow progression can be expected in children on HAART. 
We reemphasize the recommendation of "early measles vaccination" to prevent 
measles infection and subsequent SSPE in these children with an increasingly 
good life expectancy in the era of HAART.

Exposures of the general population to manufactured nanoparticles (MNPs) are 
expected to keep rising due to increasing use of MNPs in common consumer 
products (PEN 2014). The present study focuses on characterizing ambient and 
indoor population exposures to silver MNPs (nAg). For situations where detailed, 
case-specific exposure-related data are not available, as in the present study, 
a novel tiered modeling system, Prioritization/Ranking of Toxic Exposures with 
GIS (Geographic Information System) Extension (PRoTEGE), has been developed: it 
employs a product Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach coupled with basic human 
Life Stage Analysis (LSA) to characterize potential exposures to chemicals of 
current and emerging concern. The PRoTEGE system has been implemented for 
ambient and indoor environments, utilizing available MNP production, usage, and 
properties databases, along with laboratory measurements of potential personal 
exposures from consumer spray products containing nAg. Modeling of environmental 
and microenvironmental levels of MNPs employs Probabilistic Material Flow 
Analysis combined with product LCA to account for releases during manufacturing, 
transport, usage, disposal, etc. Human exposure and dose characterization 
further employs screening Microenvironmental Modeling and Intake Fraction 
methods combined with LSA for potentially exposed populations, to assess 
differences associated with gender, age, and demographics. Population 
distributions of intakes, estimated using the PRoTEGE framework, are consistent 
with published individual-based intake estimates, demonstrating that PRoTEGE is 
capable of capturing realistic exposure scenarios for the US population. 
Distributions of intakes are also used to calculate biologically-relevant 
population distributions of uptakes and target tissue doses through human airway 
dosimetry modeling that takes into account product MNP size distributions and 
age-relevant physiological parameters.

BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinoma is the second most frequent cancer of the uterine 
cervix after squamous carcinoma, and the most frequent histotype is the mucinous 
one. Endo-cervical adenocarcinoma accounts for about 10-30% of all cervical 
cancers and clinically the lesion can be asymptomatic or, more frequently, 
presenting with anomalous bleeding and/or vaginal discharge.
CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old woman with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the 
uterine cervix was subjected to chemotherapy after radical surgery. During the 
follow-up, the patient underwent a Positron Emission Tomography integrated with 
Computed Tomography and pelvic Magnetic Resonance, which showed rapid and 
diffuse disease progression from the site of the lesion to the pelvic bones.
CONCLUSIONS: Bone involvement in patients with cervical cancer, being a rare 
event, is significant since it greatly reduces life expectancy. The majority of 
metastatic bone lesions in cervical cancer seem to be of osteolytic nature. In 
our patient, Positron Emission Tomography integrated with Computed Tomography 
and Magnetic Resonance were the imaging methods used during the follow-up and 
both techniques clearly showed diffuse and rapid tumour spread to the bones.

Purpose/Introduction: The number of hip fractures is rising, due to increases in 
life expectancy. In such cases, patients are at risk from post-operative 
complications and subsequently the average length of hospitalization may be 
extended. In 2011, we established a clinical pathway (CP), a specific model of 
care for patient-care management, to improve the clinical and economic outcomes 
of proximal femoral fracture management in elderly patients. The goal was to 
evaluate the CP using clinical, process, and financial indicators.
METHODS: We included all surgical patients aged 65 and over, admitted to the 
emergency department with a fracture of the proximal femur following a fall. 
Assessment parameters included three performance indicators: clinical, process, 
and financial. The clinical indicators were the presence or absence of acute 
delirium on the third post-operative day, diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia, and 
the number of patients fulfilling at least 75% of their nutritional requirements 
at the end of the hospitalization period. The process indicator was the time 
interval between arrival at the emergency department and surgery. The financial 
indicator was based on the number of days spent in hospital.
RESULTS: From 2011 to 2013, 669 patients were included in the CP. We observed 
that the average length of stay in hospital decreased as soon as the CP was 
implemented and stabilized afterwards. The goal of 90% of patients undergoing 
surgery within 48 h of arrival in the emergency department was surpassed in 2013 
(93.1%). Furthermore, we observed an improvement in the clinical indicators.
CONCLUSION: The application of a CP allowed an improvement in the qualitative 
and quantitative efficiency of proximal femoral fracture management in elderly 
patients, in terms of clinical, process, and financial factors.

SIRT1 is a highly conserved NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that is involved 
in diverse cellular processes. SIRT1 can deacetylate not only histones, but also 
a growing number of nonhistone substrates involved in multiple signaling 
pathways. Accumulating evidence has indicated that SIRT1 is a key regulator of 
life span extension, DNA damage, metabolism stress, inflammation, and cancer. In 
inflammation, SIRT1 deacetylates several transcription factors and regulates the 
immune cell responses. In cancer, recent discoveries revealed opposite effects 
of SIRT1 as an oncoprotein or a tumor suppressor under different conditions. In 
the tumor microenvironment, both infiltrated immune cells and cancer cells can 
be affected by SIRT1. Understanding the proper cancer-related functions of SIRT1 
in both systems may provide potential evidence for SIRT1-based therapies. Here, 
we discuss the current understanding of SIRT1 in regulating immune responses and 
tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND: Biocompatible solutions may lower peritonitis rates, but are more 
costly than conventional solutions. The aim of the present study was to assess 
the additional costs and health outcomes of biocompatible over conventional 
solutions in incident peritoneal dialysis patients to guide practice decisions.
STUDY DESIGN: Secondary economic evaluation of a randomized controlled trial.
SETTING & POPULATION: 185 participants in the balANZ trial.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Cost-effectiveness of biocompatible compared to 
standard solution over the 2 years using an Australian health care funder 
perspective.
INTERVENTION: Intervention group received biocompatible solutions and control 
group received standard solutions over 2 years.
OUTCOMES: Costs included dialysis charges, costs of treating peritonitis, 
non-peritonitis-related hospital stays, and medication. Peritonitis was the 
health outcome of interest; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were reported 
in terms of the additional cost per additional patient avoiding peritonitis at 2 
years.
RESULTS: Mean total per-patient costs were A$57,451 and A$53,930 for the 
biocompatible and standard-solution groups, respectively. The base-case analysis 
indicated an incremental cost of A$17,804 per additional patient avoiding 
peritonitis at 2 years for biocompatible compared to standard solution. In a 
sensitivity analysis excluding extreme outliers for non-peritonitis-related 
hospitalizations, mean per-patient costs were A$49,159 and A$52,009 for the 
biocompatible and standard-solution groups, respectively. Consequently, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio also was reduced significantly: 
biocompatible solution became both less costly and more effective than standard 
solution and, in economic terms, was dominant over standard solution.
LIMITATIONS: Peritonitis was a secondary outcome of the balANZ trial. Health 
outcomes measured only in terms of patients avoiding peritonitis over 2 years 
may underestimate the longer term benefits (eg, prolonged technique survival).
CONCLUSIONS: Biocompatible dialysis solutions may offer a cost-effective 
alternative to standard solutions for peritoneal dialysis patients. Reductions 
in peritonitis-related hospital costs may offset the higher costs of 
biocompatible solution.

OBJECTIVES: The determinants of health and mortality inequalities in New Zealand 
and Australia have been subjected to research, with the influence of a range of 
socio-economic and demographic influences (deprivation, social class, ethnicity) 
receiving notable attention. Both countries are considered privileged, 
positioned amongst the world leaders in rankings of mortality and life 
expectancy. This paper reports on observed rates of mortality and views how the 
countries have fared over time with respect to one another.
STUDY DESIGN, OBSERVATIONAL, METHODS: This study derives comparable rates of 
mortality for both New Zealand and Australia, disaggregated by age and sex for 
the time period 1948-2008. The age-standardised rates are visualised using the 
Lexis mapping software program, showing the relative differences between the 
countries over time whilst simultaneously highlighting age, period and cohort 
effects.
RESULTS: Relative to Australia, New Zealand had advantageous rates of mortality 
across almost all age groups between the years 1948 and 1980 (approximately). 
For both sexes, a dramatic reversal of fortunes in New Zealand has followed 
relative to Australia. For example, for younger males in New Zealand, the 
reversal is startling. Over the time period observed, males aged 10-20 years in 
New Zealand have moved from an advantageous position of having a mortality rate 
20% lower than Australia to a relative position of 50% higher.
CONCLUSIONS: The social and economic forces in both New Zealand and Australia 
which may have driven the divergence require further scrutiny. It is argued 
here, that the changing fortunes of the populations are linked to the process of 
selective migration and the large-scale population movements between the 
countries facilitated by the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. These findings 
have important implications for policy formation and service planning, if the 
inequality in mortality between the areas of study is to be addressed.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze trends in mortality in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and 
Mexico, between 2000 and 2011, by sex and 5-year age groups (between 20 and 79 
years of age).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality vital statistics and census data or projected 
population estimates were used for each country. Age-specific mortality rates 
and the years of life lost were calculated.
RESULTS: Among the countries analyzed, Mexico had the highest mortality rate and 
lost the most years of life due to diabetes. Between 2000 and 2011, Mexicans 
lost an average of 1.13 years of life, while Colombia (0.24), Argentina (0.21) 
and Chile (0.18) lost considerably fewer life years. In general, deaths from 
diabetes were higher in men than in women except in Colombia. Nearly 80% of 
years of life lost due to diabetes occurred between 50 and 74 years of age in 
the four countries.
DISCUSSION: Diabetes is a huge challenge for Latin America, especially in Mexico 
where mortality due to diabetes is accelerating. Even though the proportion of 
deaths due to diabetes in Argentina, Chile and Colombia is smaller, this disease 
figures among the main causes of death in these countries.

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be associated 
with thyroid cancer risk in two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and were 
validated in a Chinese population. Because of a lack of further clinical and 
functional evidence, the clinical significances of these SNPs remain unknown. 
Four GWAS-identified SNPs of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), rs965513, rs944289, 
rs966423 and rs2439302, were genotyped in a case-control study of 838 patients 
with PTC and 501 patients with benign thyroid tumor (BTT) from the Chinese Han 
population. The associations between these SNPs, clinicopathologic features, and 
the outcome of the PTC patients were examined. The CT and CT + TT genotypes of 
rs966423 were more common in PTC patients with extrathyroidal extension and more 
advanced T stage. The TC and TC + CC genotypes and the C allele of rs944289 were 
significantly less frequent in patients with multifocal disease. No correlation 
was observed between GWAS-identified SNPs and disease persistence of PTC after a 
short-term follow-up. Significantly different allele distributions between the 
PTC and BTT groups were observed for all four selected SNPs. Individuals with 
more than five risk alleles were 8.84-fold (95% CI 3.23-24.17) more likely to 
suffer from PTC compared with those with zero or 1 risk allele. GWAS-identified 
SNPs affect the individual predisposition to PTC without interacting with 
existing Hashimoto thyroiditis and BTT lesions. GWAS-identified SNPs were 
associated with certain clinicopathologic features of PTC, and may contribute to 
identifying PTC patients with different clinical patterns. Large prospective 
studies are required to further evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic power of 
these genetic markers.

Aniridia is a rare, congenital ocular disorder with the characteristics of 
incomplete formation of the iris caused by the mutations of the paired box 
gene-6 (PAX6). To investigate the clinical characterization and the underlying 
genetic defect in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant aniridia, we 
recruited the family members who underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination. 
A novel heterozygous PAX6 deletion mutation c.796 del G (p.A266 fs) (GenBank ID: 
KP255960) in exon 10 was exclusively observed in all affected individuals but 
not in any of the unaffected family members or unrelated controls. The PAX6 mRNA 
level was about 50% lower in patients with aniridia than in unaffected family 
members, indicating that this mutation caused nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In 
conclusion, we identified a novel deletion mutation in the PAX6 gene resulting 
in an abnormal PAX6 COOH-terminal extension in the Chinese family with aniridia. 
Our study further expands the mutation spectrum of PAX6.

Global dietary and lifestyle trends are primary risk factors for communicable 
and non-communicable diseases. An ecological analysis was conducted to examine 
the association of global dietary and lifestyle patterns with total cholesterol 
concentrations. This study also investigated whether total cholesterol modified 
the association between dietary and lifestyle habits with 
disability-adjusted-life-years-lost (DALYs) for infectious and cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs). Country-specific mean total cholesterol concentrations and 
DALYs for infectious and CVDs were obtained. Data were then matched to 
country-specific food and energy availability for consumption and information on 
obesity, physical inactivity, urbanization, gross domestic product (GDP), life 
expectancy and smoking. Stepwise multiple regression models were developed to 
identify significant predictors of total cholesterol concentrations and DALYs 
for infectious and CVDs. Life expectancy and egg and meat consumption were 
significantly associated with cholesterol concentrations. DALYs for infectious 
diseases were associated with smoking, life expectancy and per capita GDP. 
Smoking was the only predictor of DALYs for CVDs. The improvement of 
socio-demographic conditions and economic growth is likely to reduce the burden 
of communicable diseases in developing countries. A concurring increase in 
non-communicable diseases is expected, and these results have, yet again, 
identified smoking as a primary risk factor for CVDs.

    Health Econ Policy Law. 2011 Oct;6(4):435-47.

In a 2011 article published in this journal, Baker et al. set out to resolve a 
nasty dilemma for NICE by reconciling two approaches for determining whether 
adopting a new intervention would increase total health gains produced from 
available resources and hence increase system efficiency. In this response we 
show how the proposed reconciliation, as well as the two approaches on which it 
is based, fail to inform decision makers about the efficiency of a new 
intervention. We show how this arises from the misuse of incremental costs and 
effects of between-intervention comparisons as measures of changes in costs and 
effects associated with marginal adjustments to the scale of an intervention. 
Ironically, incremental data represent the choices faced by decision makers and 
we illustrate a method for determining unambiguously whether a new intervention 
represents an improvement in efficiency.

The surface of enveloped viruses can be extensively glycosylated. Unlike the 
glycans coating pathogens such as bacteria and fungi, glycans on viruses are 
added and processed by the host-cell during biosynthesis. Glycoproteins are 
typically subjected to α-mannosidase processing and Golgi-mediated 
glycosyltransferase extension to form complex-type glycans. In envelope viruses, 
exceptions to this default pathway are common and lead to the presence of 
oligomannose-type glycan structures on the virion surface. In one extreme 
example, HIV-1 utilises a high density of glycans to limit host antibody 
recognition of protein. However, the high density limits glycan processing and 
the resulting oligomannose structures can be recognised by broadly neutralising 
antibodies isolated from HIV-1 infected patients. Here we discuss how divergence 
from host-cell glycosylation can be targeted for vaccine design.

LINGO-1 is a transmembrane receptor expressed primarily in the central nervous 
system (CNS) and plays an important role in myelination. Recent studies have 
indicated that it is also involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) 
survival and differentiation; however, the downstream signaling pathway 
underlying OPC development is unknown. In our previous study, we found that 
LINGO-1 is associated with WNK1 in mediating Nogo-induced neurite extension 
inhibition by RhoA activation. In an effort to identify the role of LINGO-1-WNK1 
in OPCs, we first confirmed that WNK1 is also expressed in OPCs and co-localized 
with LINGO-1, which suppresses WNK1 expression by RNA interference-attenuated 
Nogo66-induced inhibition of OPC differentiation. Furthermore, we mapped the 
WNK1 kinase domain using several fragmented peptides to identify the key region 
of interaction with LINGO-1. We found that a sequence corresponding to the D6 
peptide is necessary for the interaction. Finally, we found that using the 
TAT-D6 peptide to introduce D6 peptide into primary cultured OPC inhibits the 
association between LINGO-1 and WNK1 and significantly attenuates Nogo66-induced 
inhibition of OPC differentiation. Taken together, our results show that WNK1, 
via a specific region on WNK1 kinase domain, interacts with LINGO-1, thus 
mediating Nogo66-inhibited OPC differentiation.

EXPRESSION III was designed to evaluate the information, needs and expectations 
of patients with ovarian cancer in different European countries. This abstract 
focuses on specific results from French OC patients. Two hundred and fifty-seven 
patients filled a 27-item questionnaire during a medical visit. Median age range 
was 63 years (26-89). Nearly all the patients (94 %) had primary surgery and 
adjuvant chemotherapy (95 %), 50 % had recurrent disease. At the time of the 
survey, 85 % reported symptoms: fatigue: 88 %, neuropathy: 55 %, 
nausea/vomiting: 40 %, pain: 39 %. Patients wished for non-alopeciant treatment 
(52 %) and a better management of fatigue (42 %). Eighty percent of the patients 
knew their chemotherapy but 60 % ignored their initial disease stage and how to 
find more information for treatment choice (91 %). Most patients (92 %) 
preferred to get it directly from their physician. Sixty-six percent expressed 
the need for clear information about their life expectancy. Still 21 % patients 
did not want to get negative information. French patients need for more support 
and clearer information on their disease. Direct information from their 
physician remains the mainstay of communication.

Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is an irreversible genetic disease, advances in 
treatment have increased the life expectancy of CF patients. Upper airway 
involvement, which is mainly due to pathological changes in the paranasal 
sinuses, is prevalent in CF patients, although many are only mildly symptomatic 
(with few symptoms). The objective of this literature review was to discuss the 
pathophysiology and current therapeutic management of chronic rhinosinusitis 
(CRS) in CF patients. The review was based on current evidence, which was 
classified in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 
criteria. When symptomatic, CRS with nasal polyps can affect quality of life and 
can lead to pulmonary exacerbations, given that the paranasal sinuses can be 
colonized with pathogenic bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection 
with P. aeruginosa plays a crucial role in morbidity and mortality after lung 
transplantation in CF patients. Although clinical treatment of the upper airways 
is recommended as initial management, this recommendation is often extrapolated 
from studies of CRS in the general population. When sinonasal disease is 
refractory to noninvasive therapy, surgery is indicated. Further studies are 
needed in order to gain a better understanding of upper airway involvement and 
improve the management of CRS in CF patients, with the objective of preserving 
lung function and avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures.

Publisher: A fibrose cística (FC) é uma doença genética irreversível, mas os 
avanços no tratamento têm aumentado a expectativa de vida dos pacientes. O 
acometimento das vias aéreas superiores, principalmente por alterações 
patológicas dos seios paranasais, é prevalente nesses pacientes, embora muitos 
apresentem poucos sintomas. O objetivo desta revisão é discutir a fisiopatologia 
e o manejo terapêutico atual da rinossinusite crônica (RSC) na FC. A revisão 
fundamentou-se nas evidências mais recentes, classificadas em conformidade com 
os critérios do Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Quando sintomática, a 
RSC com pólipos nasais pode afetar a qualidade de vida e as exacerbações 
pulmonares, já que os seios paranasais podem ser colonizados por bactérias 
patogênicas, principalmente a Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Essa bactéria tem papel 
crucial na morbidade e mortalidade após o transplante pulmonar em pacientes com 
FC. Embora o tratamento clínico das vias aéreas superiores seja indicado no 
manejo inicial, a indicação é muitas vezes extrapolada de estudos sobre RSC na 
população geral. A cirurgia é a alternativa quando o quadro nasossinusal é 
refratário à terapia não invasiva. Mais estudos são necessários para compreender 
melhor o acometimento das vias aéreas superiores e melhorar o manejo da RSC na 
FC, a fim de preservar a função pulmonar e evitar procedimentos invasivos 
desnecessários.

Cnidarians are numbered among the most venomous organisms. Their venoms are 
contained in intracellular capsules, nematocysts, which inject the content into 
preys/attackers through an eversion system resembling a syringe needle. Several 
cnidarian venoms have activity against the nervous system, being neurotoxic, or 
affect other systems whose functioning is under nerve control. Besides direct 
damage to nerve cells, the activity on ionic conductance, blockade of 
neuromuscular junctions, and influence on action potentials and on voltage-gated 
channels have been described. Therefore, cnidarians can be a useful source of 
nervous system-targeted compounds which could have, in perspective, a role in 
the therapy of some nervous system diseases. Following this idea, this article 
aims to review the existing data about the neuroactive properties of cnidarian 
venoms and their possible usefulness in tackling some neurological diseases as 
well as neurodegenerative age-related diseases whose incidence is expected to 
raise in the next decades owing to the increase of life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness of nucleoside analogues and 
peg-interferon alfa-2a (peg-IFNa2a) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B 
(CHB) in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients.
METHODS: A multi-health slate Markov model was developed based on the disease 
progression pattern to estimate the long-term effect and medical expense of 
different treatments for HBeAg-negative CHB.Incremental cost-effectiveness 
analysis was then carried out.
RESULTS: In comparison with no antiretroviral treatment, all of the 
antiretroviral treatments were capable of prolonging CHB patients' life years.In 
particular, entecavir plus adefovir dipivoxil combination therapy showed the 
best 2 year survival, with expected life-years and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) being 19.59 years and 10.12 years, respectively, which were 1.46 years 
and 1.12 years better than with no antiretroviral treatment. The most 
cost-effective treatment for HBeAg-negative CHB was lamivudine plus adefovir 
dipivoxil rescue therapy, as it prolonged survival by 0.95 QALYs with an 
additional 15459 yuan; the incremental medical cost for gaining 1 QALY was 16273 
yuan.
CONCLUSION: Among the antiretroviral medicines applied as therapy for 
HBeAg-negative CHB in China, the most effective treatment is entecavir plus 
adefovir dipivoxil rescue therapy and the most cost-effective treatment is 
lamivudine plus adefovir dipivoxil rescue therapy.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to document Australian policies on 
the physical health of people with mental illness and evaluate the capacity of 
policy to support health needs.
METHODS: A search of state and federal policies on mental and physical illness 
was conducted, as well as detailed analysis of policy content and the 
relationships between policies, by applying the World Health Organization Mental 
Health Action Plan 2013-2020 as an evaluative framework.
RESULTS: National policy attention to the physical health of people with mental 
illness has grown, but there is little interconnection at the national and state 
levels. State policies across the country are inconsistent, and there is little 
evidence of consistent policy implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: A coherent national health policy framework on addressing 
co-occurring physical and mental illnesses that includes healthcare system 
reforms and ensuring the interconnectedness of other relevant services should be 
prioritised.

Brachiocephalic and basilic fistula.

Istanbul - Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: Brescia-Cimino radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) remains 
the first choice vascular access procedure for patients in need of long-term 
hemodialysis. Brachiocephalic fistulas are considered as a secondary option in 
almost all published guidelines. Recently in many reports, elbow and upper arm 
fistulas are recommended to be used as primary fistulas especially in elderly, 
diabetic, hypertensive patients. Elbow fistulas (brachiocephalic and 
brachiobasilic) should only rarely be constructed as primary fistulas. Forearm 
AVFs should be tried first to give a chance to the patient, because it is not 
the maturation-patency rates per se but also lowering the complication rates and 
saving the vessels for future use are equally important.
BACKGROUND: The average life expectancy of patients receiving hemodialysis has 
increased in recent years and many patients now live longer and require 
secondary or tertiary procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: When forearm fistulas have failed, brachiocephalic AVF is usually 
preferred first, because of cephalic vein's appropriate anatomy for easy 
cannulation and ease of the operation. Operative procedure is less invasive 
compared to brachiobasilic AVF, therefore BC should be the procedure of choice 
when both veins are available.

INTRODUCTION: Comparing multiple, diverse outcomes with cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA) is important, yet challenging in areas like palliative care where 
domains are unamenable to integration with survival. Generic multi-attribute 
utility values exclude important domains and non-health outcomes, while partial 
analyses-where outcomes are considered separately, with their joint relationship 
under uncertainty ignored-lead to incorrect inference regarding preferred 
strategies.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to consider whether such decision 
making can be better informed with alternative presentation and summary 
measures, extending methods previously shown to have advantages in multiple 
strategy comparison.
METHODS: Multiple outcomes CEA of a home-based palliative care model (PEACH) 
relative to usual care is undertaken in cost disutility (CDU) space and compared 
with analysis on the cost-effectiveness plane. Summary measures developed for 
comparing strategies across potential threshold values for multiple outcomes 
include: expected net loss (ENL) planes quantifying differences in expected net 
benefit; the ENL contour identifying preferred strategies minimising ENL and 
their expected value of perfect information; and cost-effectiveness 
acceptability planes showing probability of strategies minimising ENL.
RESULTS: Conventional analysis suggests PEACH is cost-effective when the 
threshold value per additional day at home (𝕜1) exceeds $1,068 or dominated by 
usual care when only the proportion of home deaths is considered. In contrast, 
neither alternative dominate in CDU space where cost and outcomes are jointly 
considered, with the optimal strategy depending on threshold values. For 
example, PEACH minimises ENL when 𝕜1=$2,000 and 𝕜2=$2,000 (threshold value for 
dying at home), with a 51.6% chance of PEACH being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Comparison in CDU space and associated summary measures have 
distinct advantages to multiple domain comparisons, aiding transparent and 
robust joint comparison of costs and multiple effects under uncertainty across 
potential threshold values for effect, better informing net benefit assessment 
and related reimbursement and research decisions.

PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term health effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of 
positron emission tomography (PET)-based isotoxic accelerated radiation therapy 
treatment (PET-ART) compared with conventional fixed-dose CT-based radiation 
therapy treatment (CRT) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our analysis uses a validated decision model, based on 
data of 200 NSCLC patients with inoperable stage I-IIIB. Clinical outcomes, 
resource use, costs, and utilities were obtained from the Maastro Clinic and the 
literature. Primary model outcomes were the difference in life-years (LYs),
