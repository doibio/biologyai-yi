AIM: As an important toxic heavy metal, lead exposure can lead to the occurrence 
of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the analysis of its disease burden 
pattern on a global scale is lacking. This study aimed to analyze the CKD burden 
attributable to lead exposure globally, regionally and temporally, as well as to 
examine the role of socio-economic factors.
METHOD: This study used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. 
We obtained the global burden of CKD caused by lead exposure between 1990 and 
2019, and stratified this burden according to factors such as gender, age, GBD 
regions, and countries. From 1990 to 2019, the changing trend of the disease 
burden of CKD attributed to lead exposure was estimated using Joinpoint 
regression model with the average annual percent change (AAPC) estimated. 
Finally, the relationship between country-level socio-economic factors and lead 
exposure related CKD burden was explored using a panel data model analysis.
RESULTS: In 2019, worldwide, there were 52.94 thousand deaths (95 % uncertainty 
interval (UI): 31.64, 76.23) and 1225.2 thousand disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) (95 % UI: 707.88, 1818) of CKD caused by lead exposure, accounting for 
3.71 % of total CKD deaths and 2.95 % of total CKD DALYs. The age-standardized 
death and DALY rates per 100,000 population were 0.68 (95 % UI: 0.40, 0.98) and 
15.02 (95 % UI: 8.68, 22.26) respectively, indicating an upward trend and stable 
trend between 1990 and 2019. However, the age-standardized rates attributed to 
lead exposure showed a wide variability across regions, with the highest rates 
in Central Latin America and the lowest in Eastern Europe. Moreover, the results 
of panel model analysis indicated that GDP growth was positively associated with 
lead exposure related CKD death rate and DALY rate. However, there were inverse 
associations between life expectancy at birth and hospital beds (per 1000 
people) with lead exposure-related CKD DALY rate.
CONCLUSION: In summary, a significant burden of CKD can be attributed to lead 
exposure, with noticeable regional discrepancies. Findings here are valuable to 
deploy efficient measures at curbing lead exposure worldwide.

Acromegaly/giantism results from the chronic excess of growth hormone (GH) and 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), in more than 96% of cases, due to a 
GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. Primary treatment of choice is transsphenoidal 
resection of the adenoma. More than 30% to 40% of operated cases require 
adjunctive forms of treatment, be it pharmacological or radiotherapeutical. The 
multimodal treatment of acromegaly has resulted in substantial improvements in 
the quality of life and life expectancy of these patients. We herein present the 
complex case of a patient with acromegaly due to a mammosomatotrope adenoma, 
with a germ-line AIP (aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein) mutation, 
who had a chronic and protracted course of more than 15 years during which he 
was treated with surgery, somatostatin receptor ligands, dopamine agonist, and 
the GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant. At one point, he was able to come off 
medications and was even found to be transiently GH-deficient, only to develop 
acromegaly again after a couple of years.

BACKGROUND: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B) is a rare hereditary 
syndrome caused mainly by Met918Thr germline RET mutation and characterized by 
medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma (PHEO), and typical 
phenotypic features. MEN 2B cases previously reported in the literature have 
variable clinical course.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to discuss the characteristics of four MEN 2B cases with 
unusual presentations,clinical course and review the recent clinical data on 
MEN2B.
RESULTS: All patients had de novo M918T mutation and no family history. The mean 
age of patients was 38.2 years (27-56). Two patients had typical phenotypic 
features of MEN 2B; the other two patients had no striking phenotypic features. 
First detected MEN 2B component was MTC in two, intestinal ganglioneuromatosis 
in one, and PHEO in one of the cases. Bilateral PHEO was detected in all four 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS: MEN 2B is a complex syndrome characterized by wide phenotypic 
variability and different clinical outcomes. To diagnose sporadic MEN 2B cases, 
genetic testing should be performed in all cases with suspicious clinical 
features. Although early diagnosis is the main factor that increases life 
expectancy, some MEN 2B patients with late diagnosis may exhibit a mild clinical 
course and better prognosis than expected, with effective treatment.

Mangrove forests are the dominant vegetation growing on low wooded islands, 
which occur in the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the northern Great 
Barrier Reef, we map remarkable, undocumented mangrove forest extension on 10 
low wooded islands in the Howick Group that collectively equates to an area of 
667 000 m2 (66.7 ha). We combine extensive field survey with canopy height 
models derived from RPA imagery and allometric scaling to quantify above ground 
biomass in both old (pre-1973) and new (post-1973) forest areas. Forest 
expansion added approximately 10 233 tonnes of new biomass since the early 
1970s. We suggest that such substantial expansion of mangrove forest has 
occurred within a short time span in response to changing environmental 
controls. These may include sea-level rise, sediment transport and deposition, 
cyclone impact and the development of associated reef flat sedimentary landforms 
including unconsolidated and lithified shingle ridges, which influence reef flat 
hydrodynamics. Our observations highlight the globally dynamic response of 
mangrove distribution and forest structure to environmental change and provide 
timely new estimates from understudied reef island settings.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the spatio-temporal pattern of maternal mortality and 
associated factors in Northeast Brazil, from 2009 to 2019.
METHODS: This was an ecological study using the joinpoint method for temporal 
analysis and spatial autocorrelation and scan tests to identify clusters; 
regression models using the ordinary least squares and geographically weighted 
regression methods were used to identify factors associated with mortality, 
considering p-value < 0.05.
RESULTS: Maternal mortality decreased by 1.5% (95%CI; -2.5;-0.5) per year 
(p-value = 0.009); clusters, of deaths were found, mainly in Piauí and Maranhão, 
the variables associated with the maternal mortality ratio were Gini Index (β = 
105.72; p-value < 0.001), municipal human development index (β = 190.91; p-value 
= 0.001), per capita income (β = -0.08; p-value = 0.001), Firjan Municipal 
Development Index-Health (β = -51.28; p-value < 0.001), life expectancy at birth 
(β = -3.50; p-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in mortality in the period studied, with a 
concentration of deaths, primarily in Piauí and Maranhão; socioeconomic 
indicators were associated with higher mortality in the region.
MAIN RESULTS: There was a decrease in maternal mortality in Northeast Brazil, 
from 2009 to 2019. Deaths were mainly concentrated in the states of Piauí and 
Maranhão. Five socioeconomic indicators were associated with higher mortality in 
the region.
IMPLICATIONS FOR SERVICES: In order to maintain the trend of falling maternal 
mortality in Northeast Brazil, the need exists to reduce social inequalities and 
expand access to health services, especially within the scope of Primary Care.
PERSPECTIVES: Public policies are needed to expand health services in general as 
well as comprehensive women's health care in the Brazilian National Health 
System, especially for women living in contexts of greater social vulnerability.

BACKGROUND: In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force expanded its lung 
screening recommendation to include persons aged 50-80 years who had ever smoked 
and had at least 20 pack-years of exposure and less than 15 years since quitting 
(YSQ). However, studies have suggested that screening persons who formerly 
smoked with longer YSQ could be beneficial.
METHODS: The authors used two validated lung cancer models to assess the 
benefits and harms of screening using various YSQ thresholds (10, 15, 20, 25, 
30, and no YSQ) and the age at which screening was stopped. The impact of 
enforcing the YSQ criterion only at entry, but not at exit, also was evaluated. 
Outcomes included the number of screens, the percentage ever screened, screening 
benefits (lung cancer deaths averted, life-years gained), and harms 
(false-positive tests, overdiagnosed cases, radiation-induced lung cancer 
deaths). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of 
restricting screening to those who had at least 5 years of life expectancy.
RESULTS: As the YSQ criterion was relaxed, the number of screens and the 
benefits and harms of screening increased. Raising the age at which to stop 
screening age resulted in additional benefits but with more overdiagnosis, as 
expected, because screening among those older than 80 years increased. Limiting 
screening to those who had at least 5 years of life expectancy would maintain 
most of the benefits while considerably reducing the harms.
CONCLUSIONS: Expanding screening to persons who formerly smoked and have greater 
than 15 YSQ would result in considerable increases in deaths averted and 
life-years gained. Although additional harms would occur, these could be 
moderated by ensuring that screening is restricted to only those with reasonable 
life expectancy.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person-years of life lost from 
cancer among US men and women. Early detection has been shown to be associated 
with reduced lung cancer mortality. Our objective was to update the American 
Cancer Society (ACS) 2013 lung cancer screening (LCS) guideline for adults at 
high risk for lung cancer. The guideline is intended to provide guidance for 
screening to health care providers and their patients who are at high risk for 
lung cancer due to a history of smoking. The ACS Guideline Development Group 
(GDG) utilized a systematic review of the LCS literature commissioned for the US 
Preventive Services Task Force 2021 LCS recommendation update; a second 
systematic review of lung cancer risk associated with years since quitting 
smoking (YSQ); literature published since 2021; two Cancer Intervention and 
Surveillance Modeling Network-validated lung cancer models to assess the 
benefits and harms of screening; an epidemiologic and modeling analysis 
examining the effect of YSQ and aging on lung cancer risk; and an updated 
analysis of benefit-to-radiation-risk ratios from LCS and follow-up 
examinations. The GDG also examined disease burden data from the National Cancer 
Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Formulation of 
recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment 
(incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms. 
The GDG judged that the overall evidence was moderate and sufficient to support 
a strong recommendation for screening individuals who meet the eligibility 
criteria. LCS in men and women aged 50-80 years is associated with a reduction 
in lung cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence 
supports LCS for men and women older than 80 years who are in good health. The 
ACS recommends annual LCS with low-dose computed tomography for asymptomatic 
individuals aged 50-80 years who currently smoke or formerly smoked and have a 
≥20 pack-year smoking history (strong recommendation, moderate quality of 
evidence). Before the decision is made to initiate LCS, individuals should 
engage in a shared decision-making discussion with a qualified health 
professional. For individuals who formerly smoked, the number of YSQ is not an 
eligibility criterion to begin or to stop screening. Individuals who currently 
smoke should receive counseling to quit and be connected to cessation resources. 
Individuals with comorbid conditions that substantially limit life expectancy 
should not be screened. These recommendations should be considered by health 
care providers and adults at high risk for lung cancer in discussions about LCS. 
If fully implemented, these recommendations have a high likelihood of 
significantly reducing death and suffering from lung cancer in the United 
States.

Analyses to inform the update of the American Cancer Society lung cancer 
screening guidelines.

BACKGROUND: This report quantifies counteracting effects of quit-years and 
concomitant aging on lung cancer risk, especially on exceeding 15 quit-years, 
when the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends curtailing 
lung-cancer screening.
METHODS: Cox models were fitted to estimate absolute lung cancer risk among 
Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) and 
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants who ever smoked. Absolute lung 
cancer risk and gainable years of life from screening for individuals aged 50 to 
80 in the US-representative National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2015-2018 
who ever smoked were projected. Relaxing USPSTF recommendations to 20/25/30 
quit-years versus augmenting USPSTF criteria with individuals whose estimated 
gain in life expectancy from screening exceeded 16.2 days according to the Life 
Years From Screening-CT (LYFS-CT) prediction model was compared.
RESULTS: Absolute lung cancer risk increased by 8.7%/year (95% CI, 7.7%-9.7%; 
p < .001) as individuals aged beyond 15 quit-years in the PLCO, with similar 
results in NHIS and NLST. For example, mean 5-year lung cancer risk for those 
aged 65 years with 15 quit-years = 1.47% (95% CI, 1.35%-1.59%) versus 1.76% (95% 
CI, 1.62%-1.90%) for those aged 70 years with 20 quit-years in the PLCO. 
Removing the quit-year criterion would make 4.9 million more people eligible and 
increase the proportion of preventable lung cancer deaths prevented 
(sensitivity) from 63.7% to 74.2%. Alternatively, augmentation using LYFS-CT 
would make 1.7 million more people eligible while increasing the lung cancer 
death sensitivity to 74.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of aging, absolute lung cancer risk increases beyond 15 
quit-years, which does not support exemption from screening or curtailing 
screening once it has been initiated. Compared with relaxing the USPSTF 
quit-year criterion, augmentation using LYFS-CT could prevent most of the deaths 
at substantially superior efficiency, while also preventing deaths among 
individuals who currently smoke with low intensity or long duration.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are 
extremely effective in preventing severe disease, but their real-world cost 
effectiveness is still an open question. We present an analysis of the 
cost-effectiveness and economic impact of the initial phase of the COVID-19 
vaccination rollout in the Basque Country, Spain.
METHODS: To calculate costs and quality-adjusted life years for the entire 
population of the Basque Country, dynamic modelling and a real-world data 
analysis were combined. Data on COVID-19 infection outcomes (cases, 
hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths) and population 
characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic status and comorbidity) during the 
initial phase of the vaccination rollout, from January to June of 2021, were 
retrieved from the Basque Health Service database. The outcomes in the 
alternative scenario (without vaccination) were estimated with the dynamic model 
used to guide public health authority policies, from February to December 2020. 
Individual comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy and costs were estimated.
RESULTS: By averting severe disease-related outcomes, COVID-19 vaccination 
resulted in monetary savings of €26.44 million for the first semester of 2021. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €707/quality-adjusted life year 
considering official vaccine prices and dominant real prices. While the analysis 
by comorbidity showed that vaccines were considerably more cost effective in 
individuals with pre-existing health conditions, this benefit was lower in the 
low socioeconomic status group.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the vaccination 
programme justified the policy of prioritising high-comorbidity patients. The 
initial phase of COVID-19 vaccination was dominant from the perspective of the 
healthcare payer.

The use of cardiac implantable electronic devices has increased in recent years 
due to factors such as a growing population, increased life expectancy, and 
improved access to healthcare services. In parallel with this trend, 
complications related to pacemakers have also increased. One of the most 
important and preventable complications among these is lead misplacement. 
Misplacement of a permanent pacemaker lead in the LV can lead to a variety of 
complications, including damage to the heart muscle, arrhythmias, blood clotes 
and cerebrovascular events. It is recommended to use the fluoroscopic 40° LAO 
view during implantation. That view clearly defines the interatrial and 
interventricular septum. Right bundle branch block pattern on ECG is an 
important clue to suspected misplaced lead. In addition to the postero-anterior 
(PA) projection of x-ray, the latero-lateral (LL) projection provides a clearer 
view of lead malposition. In the LL view, the tip of an incorrectly positioned 
LV lead is characteristically directed toward the spine. If diagnosed soon after 
implantation, percutaneous lead extraction can reduce the risk of future 
thromboembolic events without the need for lifelong anticoagulation. It should 
be noted that in cases with a lead in the LV for a long time, lead removal is 
not the primary recommendation. Patient-based approach should be fundamental.

The γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABAergic) system participates in many aspects 
of organismal physiology and disease, including proteostasis, neuronal 
dysfunction, and life-span extension. Many of these phenotypes are also 
regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the redox mechanisms linking the 
GABAergic system to these phenotypes are not well defined. Here, we report that 
GABAergic redox signaling cell nonautonomously activates many stress response 
pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans and enhances vulnerability to proteostasis 
disease in the absence of oxidative stress. Cell nonautonomous redox activation 
of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mitoUPR) proteostasis network 
requires UNC-49, a GABAA receptor that we show is activated by hydrogen 
peroxide. MitoUPR induction by a spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) C. elegans 
neurodegenerative disease model was similarly dependent on UNC-49 in C. elegans. 
These results demonstrate a multi-tissue paradigm for redox signaling in the 
GABAergic system that is transduced via a GABAA receptor to function in cell 
nonautonomous regulation of health, proteostasis, and disease.

BACKGROUND: There are a variety of inventories available to evaluate human 
lateral preference, but no previous review has systematically analyzed and 
compared them.
PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify these 
inventories and describe their characteristics (e.g., dimensions, scales, tasks, 
psychometric properties).
STUDY SAMPLE: We included 26 articles, each presenting a different inventory to 
assess lateral preference, published between 1900 and 2022, selected from the 
following databases: PubMed, SportDiscus, APA PsycNET, and Web of Science.
RESULTS: These inventories analyzed tasks performed in everyday life (domestic, 
work-related, sports, and leisure/recreation activities), covering hand, foot, 
hearing, visual and other non-usual lateral preference dimensions, such as trunk 
and head. Most inventories classified individuals based on the direction (left, 
indifferent or right preference) and degree (consistent or moderate) of 
laterality. However, many of the reviewed inventories lack established 
psychometric verification in their original publication, such as validity, 
reliability, responsiveness, and practical applicability. Inventories also 
presented tasks that may be specific to a given cultural setting, limiting their 
application across different countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive guide for 
researchers to select a lateral preference assessment tool, but also advocate 
for a new inventory with a broader approach, containing more than one dimension 
of lateral preference (i.e., not only handedness) and tasks that are common to 
different cultures to enhance practical applicability worldwide.

BACKGROUND: and objective: This study examined the validity of sniff nasal 
inspiratory (SNIP) and reverse-sniff nasal expiratory pressures (RSNEP) for 
estimating respiratory muscle strength and for predicting poor life expectancy 
following exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD).
METHODS: This prospective study included patients who were admitted for COPD 
exacerbation and underwent rehabilitation. At hospital discharge, SNIP, RSNEP, 
and maximum mouth inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory pressures (MEP) were 
measured, and the body mass index, degree of airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and 
exercise capacity (BODE) index was calculated by evaluating body mass index, 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), the Modified Medical Research Council 
Dyspnea Scale, and 6-min walk distance.
RESULTS: Data from 43 patients (mean age 76.8 years, FEV1 42.8 % predicted) were 
analyzed. SNIP and RSNEP were moderately correlated with MIP and MEP, 
respectively. Bland-Altman plot means of SNIP (48.3 ± 17.5) and RSNEP 
(44.7 ± 23.8 cmH2O) were lower than those of MIP (54.8 ± 19.9) and MEP 
(76.4 ± 31.2 cmH2O), respectively, and the SNIP-MIP and RSNEP-MEP 95 % limits of 
agreement were wide. Logistic regression showed that SNIP and RSNEP were 
significantly associated with BODE score ≥7 (poor life expectancy), and 
predictive accuracy was 81.4 % when combining SNIP ≤49 and RSNEP ≤42 cmH2O.
CONCLUSION: After exacerbation in patients with COPD, SNIP and RSNEP are useful 
indicators that complement MIP and MEP. Furthermore, a combined SNIP and RSNEP 
test may be beneficial in predicting poor life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery 
disease is advised for patients with low perioperative stroke risk and life 
expectancy of three to five years. We sought to explore the role of risk 
stratification and postoperative medical management in identifying appropriate 
asymptomatic candidates for CEA in the end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) 
population.
METHODS: We identified ESKD patients on dialysis from the United States Renal 
Data System (USRDS) that underwent CEA (2008 - 2014) for asymptomatic carotid 
artery disease. We used the Liu comorbidity index as well as a novel risk 
prediction model based on Cox-proportional hazards model to stratify patients. 
The primary outcome evaluated was three-year survival, and Kaplan-Meier methods 
were used to generate survival estimates. We further conducted a sub-analysis of 
patients with Medicare part D data to determine postoperative usage of the 
following medications: statins, antiplatelets, and antihypertensives. We 
evaluated the association of medication utilization and three-year survival 
using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards modelling.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,813 patients meeting inclusion criteria. The population 
was predominantly older (mean age 70.2±9.1), White (84.8%) and had a high 
prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension (90.7%), 
diabetes (62.5%) and CHF (35.4%). Among the entire cohort, 23.0% had a Liu 
comorbidity index ≤ 8, 35.0% had index 9 to 12, and 42.0% had index >12. 
Increasing Liu comorbidity index was associated with worse survival (p<0.01), 
however even the group with Liu index ≤ 8 had poor three-year survival of 58.8 
(53.9 - 63.4) %. The Cox proportional hazards model identified variables for 
inclusion in the risk model such as age>80 (aHR=2.49, 95% CI [1.87-3.33], 
p<0.001), congestive heart failure (aHR=1.31, 95% CI [1.14-1.51], p<0.001) and 
Liu comorbidity index > 12 (aHR=1.89, 95% C.I. [1.56 - 2.28], p<0.001). The risk 
score generated ranged from 0 to 6.5, and patients were divided into three 
groups: score ≤2 (43.4%), 2 to 4 (41.2%), and >4 (15.4%). Increasing risk score 
was associated with worse survival (p<0.01) but even the "low-risk" group had 
three-year survival of 58.5 (54.9 - 61.9)%. Sub-analysis of the 1,249 (68.8% of 
total) patients with part D data found that statins and calcium channel blocker 
use was associated with improved survival, although observed rates for patients 
on drug were still low.
CONCLUSION: The overall long-term survival of ESKD patients undergoing CEA for 
asymptomatic carotid artery disease is low. Risk stratification and analysis of 
postoperative medical management did not identify a subgroup of patients with 
adequate three-year survival. Hence, the preventive benefits of CEA are not 
realized in these patients.

INTRODUCTION: Long-term care needs for people with dementia are predicted to 
increase due to increased life expectancy and dementia diagnoses. Most published 
meta- syntheses of dementia care focus on hospitals or home settings. When 
focusing on long-term care facilities, most reviews about dementia care only 
focus on a single outcome, such as feeding, behavioural symptoms management, 
palliative care and others, which is limited. The present study aims to 
synthesise qualitative data and examine barriers and facilitators to caring for 
people with dementia in long-term care facilities.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is the protocol for our systematic review and 
meta-synthesis, which describes the design of this study, and we plan to 
complete the study from October 2023 to November 2024. The systematic review and 
meta-synthesis will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance for 
systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. Nine databases (five English and 
four Chinese) were searched, including Embase, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, 
PsycINFO and Wan Fang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP and 
Chinese Biomedical Medicine, from inception to August 2023. Qualitative and 
mixed-approach research about barriers and facilitators to caring for people 
with dementia in long-term care facilities, which are reported in English or 
Chinese, will be included. Covidence software will help with study selection, 
assessment and data extraction. The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for 
Qualitative Research (2020) will be used for included studies' quality 
assessment. Data extraction will be based on the JBI Qualitative Assessment and 
Review Instrument Data Extraction Tool for Qualitative Research. The JBI 
aggregation approach will be used to synthesise data. We will use the JBI 
ConQual tool to assess the credibility and dependability of each synthesised 
finding to establish confidence in the synthesised findings. All review steps 
will be managed by two reviewers independently, and disparities will be 
discussed. If consensus cannot reach a resolution, a third reviewer will be 
consulted.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The present study is a secondary analysis of published 
qualitative data. So ethical approval is not required. The findings may be 
disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference papers or elsewhere.
PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: The protocol was registered with the International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in May 2022, and the 
registration number is CRD42022326178.

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) is one of the most prevalent deficiencies 
in patients with hypopituitarism and several cohort studies have demonstrated an 
increased mortality risk in hypopituitary patients with a presumed GHD. The 
cause of the excess mortality is most likely multifactorial, including the 
etiology of the hypopituitarism, non-physiological replacement therapies (mostly 
glucocorticoid), tumor treatment and its side effects as well as untreated GHD. 
Several years later, other cohort studies that investigated life expectancy in 
patients with hypopituitarism on GH replacement therapy (GHRT) that showed a 
normalized mortality. By comparison of the distribution of characteristics of 
interest between cohorts, we discuss the existing literature to answer the 
following question: does growth hormone replacement really improve mortality 
rates in adult patients with hypopituitarism and GHD? We also conducted a 
meta-analysis of these studies. Since the literature suffers from selection and 
time bias (improvement of tumor management and other pituitary hormone 
replacement therapies), there is no high-quality evidence that replacement 
therapy for GHD really improves mortality. However, the available data does 
suggest that GHRT plays a significant part in the normalization of the mortality 
in patients with hypopituitarism.

BACKGROUND: Stronger primary health care (PHC) is critical to achieving the 
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. However, there is scarce evidence 
on the impact of PHC on health system performance in developing countries. Since 
2009, China has implemented an ambitious health system reform, among which PHC 
has received unprecedented attention. This study investigates the role of PHC 
resource in improving health status, financial protection and health equity.
METHODS: We obtained province-level and individual-level data to conduct a 
longitudinal study across the period of China's health system reform. The 
dependent variables included health outcomes and financial protection. The 
independent variables were the number of PHC physicians and share of PHC 
physicians in all physicians. Mixed-effect models were used for adjusted 
associations.
RESULTS: From 2003 to 2017, the number of PHC physicians slightly increased by 
31.75 per 100,000 persons and the share of PHC physicians in all physicians 
increased by 3.62 percentage points. At the province level, greater PHC 
physician density was positively associated with life expectancy, negatively 
associated with age-standardized excess mortality, infectious disease mortality, 
perinatal mortality low birth weight, as well as the share of health expenses in 
total consumption expenses. At the individual and household level, greater PHC 
physician density was positively associated with self-assessed health, and 
negatively associated with incidence of catastrophic health expenditures. 
Compared to other quintiles, the poorest quintile benefited more from PHC 
physician density.
CONCLUSIONS: In China, an increased PHC physician supply was associated with 
improved health system performance. While China's PHC system has been 
strengthened in the context of China's health system reforms, further effective 
incentives should be developed to attract more qualified PHC workers.

The study examined the relationship between financial remittances and health 
outcomes in 45 sub-Saharan African countries (SSA) using data obtained from the 
World Development Indicator (WDI) over the period 1990 to 2021. Because of the 
issue of endogeneity, the System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) was 
adopted to analyze the impact of remittances on life expectancy and infant 
mortality respectively. The results showed that contrary to expectations, 
remittances did not significantly improve life expectancy and infant mortality 
rate in SSA. The life expectancy in the previous year, has a statically 
significant impact on life expectancy at birth for the current year. Also, the 
lagged value of infant mortality rate significantly increased under five 
mortality. Therefore, the study recommends that governments in SSA sub-region 
should evolve policies aimed at guiding recipients of remittances towards 
effective utilization with a view to improving social welfare and health 
outcomes.

Publisher: L'étude a examiné la relation entre les envois de fonds et les 
résultats de santé dans 45 pays d'Afrique subsaharienne (ASS) à l'aide des 
données obtenues à partir de l'indicateur du développement mondial (WDI) sur la 
période 1990 à 2021. En raison de la question de l'endogénéité, la méthode 
généralisée du système of Moments (SGMM) a été adopté pour analyser l’impact des 
envois de fonds sur l’espérance de vie et la mortalité infantile respectivement. 
Les résultats ont montré que contrairement aux attentes, les envois de fonds 
n’ont pas amélioré de manière significative l’espérance de vie et le taux de 
mortalité infantile en ASS. L’espérance de vie de l’année précédente a un impact 
statiquement significatif sur l’espérance de vie à la naissance de l’année en 
cours. En outre, la valeur décalée du taux de mortalité infantile a
