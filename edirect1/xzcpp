RESULTS: Assuming no price reductions following LOE, fingolimod was considered 
cost-effective versus IM IFNβ-1a ($118,434 per quality-adjusted life-year), 
despite having higher total direct costs over 10 years ($475,740 vs. $446,792). 
When including future price reductions following LOE, total direct costs were 
reduced with fingolimod and were lower than those accrued with IM IFNβ-1a over 
the model time horizon ($308,570 vs. $442,653). Cost-effectiveness results were 
sensitive to changes in both clinical parameters and medication costs. Scenario 
analyses demonstrated that an earlier date of LOE was associated with lower 
total costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Health economic models may predict higher total costs when the 
price reductions following LOE are not considered. Here, oral fingolimod was 
seen to be cost-saving versus IM IFNβ-1a over the model time horizon when such 
price reductions were included. The cost implications of not accounting for 
future price changes may determine whether an intervention is considered 
cost-effective and as such may influence reimbursement decisions based on 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. Multiple product types (e.g., oral, injectable, 
and infused agents) have been approved for use as treatments for multiple 
sclerosis in the United States, and LOE is likely to have a different effect on 
each of these therapies.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the relationship between the plasmatic CD63 and CAV1 
positive exosome levels, in patients with OSCC before and after surgical 
treatment and to correlate it with their overall survival.
METHODS: A double-blind pilot study over 10 patients OSCC and T4 stage without 
distant metastases or local bone invasion has been performed. The average 
follow-up period was 37.64 months (34.3⁻40.84). We obtained 2 plasma tubes of 1 
mL each before surgery and 7 days after surgery. Before performing the 
immunocapture-based analysis, EVs (Extracellular Vesicles) were isolated from 
the plasma and characterized with western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Mean values of CD63 positive plasmatic exosomes (EXO-CD63) after 
surgery decreased from 750.88 ± 286.67 to 541.71 ± 244.93 (p = 0.091). On the 
other hand, CAV-1 positive plasmatic exosomes (EXO-CAV-1) increased after 
surgery from 507 ± 483.39 to 1120.25 ± 1151.17 (p = 0.237). Patients with 
EXO-CD63 levels lower than the mean global value before the surgery had a 
survival of 36.04 months compared with the group with EXO-CD63 higher than the 
average who only survived 12.49 ± 1.67 months from the diagnosis, p = 0.225. 
When EXO-CAV-1 levels before surgery was lower than the average (813.94 ± 
801.21) overall survival was 24.69 ± 22.23 months in contrast when it was higher 
that was only 11.64 months, p = 0.157. Patients with lower EXO-CD63 levels after 
surgery lived an average of 23.84 ± 23.9 months, while those with higher 
plasmatic levels of EXO-CD63 live 13.35 months, p = 0.808. When EXO-CAV-1 levels 
after surgery were lower, the average overall survival was 20.344 ± 15.40 
months, in contrast when the EXO-CAV-1 levels were higher showing rather an 
estimate survival expectation of 1.64 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment induced a dramatic reduction of the plasmatic 
levels of exosomes expressing CD63 as early as 1 week after resection. This 
first result suggests that the tumour mass is responsible of the high levels of 
circulating exosomes detected in cancer patients. At the same time point exosome 
expressing CAV-1 increased, possibly due to the inflammatory reaction 
immediately after surgery. Lastly, statistical analysis showed that lower levels 
of plasmatic exosomes both before and after surgery correlated with a better 
life expectancy of OSCC patients. Hopefully, this approach will prove useful in 
the clinical follow-up of cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the main causes of 
cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mortality is most often 
attributable to metastatic disease. Despite the progress achieved so far, life 
expectancy continues to be limited in most patients. Ramucirumab, a most recent 
antiangiogenic drug, is vying in the race to metastatic CRC (mCRC) treatment 
since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on the 
results of the RAISE study.
AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the role of ramucirumab in mCRC, including 
clinical indication, safety issues, and future perspectives.
EXPERT OPINION: The use of Ramucirumab in clinical practice is still limited, 
probably due to economic burden and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future 
efforts will be addressed to improve our knowledge in the use of this drug and 
better guide us in patients' care.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify and compare the contribution of 306 diseases and injuries 
to the changes in health adjusted life expectancy at birth (HALE0) between 1990 
and 2013.
DESIGN: Retrospective demographic analysis based on aggregated data and using 
life table technique, Sullivan method, and decomposition method for differences 
in health expectancy.
SETTING: The globe, 21 regions, and 187 countries, covered in the Global Burden 
of Disease Study (GBD) 2013.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cause specific contribution to changes in HALE0 between 
1990 and 2013 in terms of mortality effect, disability effect, and total effect.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2013, global HALE0 increased by 5.31 years for males 
and 5.73 years for females. The cross national Gini coefficient of HALE0 for 
both sexes combined decreased by 15.22% from 0.0736 to 0.0624. HALE0 declined in 
11 countries during the period, predominantly owing to HIV/AIDS except in 
Belize, Belarus, and Paraguay. Controlling communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional diseases accounted for 56.47% (3.10 years) of changes in HALE0 for 
both sexes combined, followed by non-communicable diseases (30.05%; 1.65 years) 
and injuries (13.67%; 0.75 years). Globally, HIV/AIDS caused the biggest 
reduction in HALE0 (-0.28 years) and mainly afflicted residents in southern 
(-7.86 years), western (-1.53 years), and eastern (-1.38 years) sub-Saharan 
Africa. Diabetes had the second biggest negative total effect on changes in 
HALE0 (-0.12 years), which was quite widespread across regions. Despite their 
positive total effect in high income regions, such non-communicable diseases as 
ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and hypertensive heart disease 
had a negative total effect in many low and middle income regions. Mortality 
reduction was the predominant driver (93.62%; 5.14 years) for improvement in 
HALE0, accompanied by an increase of 0.80 years in life expectancy lived with 
disability at birth. Only 44 (27%) of 163 causes at level 3 in the GBD cause 
hierarchy influenced changes in HALE0, mainly or only through disability.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 1990 and 2013, the globe made achievements in not only 
promoting population health as a whole but reducing health inequality between 
countries. This study pinpoints the priority diseases and injuries for altering 
the declining health trend in 11 countries, for curbing the epidemic of 
non-communicable diseases in low and middle income countries, and for promoting 
compression of morbidity worldwide. The detailed country specific decomposition 
results of effects of diseases and injuries on change in population health will 
further facilitate the development of national health policies.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the technical efficiency of health 
systems in Asia.
SETTINGS: The study was conducted in Asian countries.
METHODS: We applied an output-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach 
to estimate the technical efficiency of the health systems in Asian countries. 
The DEA model used per-capita health expenditure (all healthcare resources as a 
proxy) as input variable and cross-country comparable health outcome indicators 
(eg, healthy life expectancy at birth and infant mortality per 1000 live births) 
as output variables. Censored Tobit regression and smoothed bootstrap models 
were used to observe the associated factors with the efficiency scores. A 
sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the consistency of these efficiency 
scores.
RESULTS: The main findings of this paper demonstrate that about 91.3% (42 of 46 
countries) of the studied Asian countries were inefficient with respect to using 
healthcare system resources. Most of the efficient countries belonged to the 
high-income group (Cyprus, Japan, and Singapore) and only one country belonged 
to the lower middle-income group (Bangladesh). Through improving health system 
efficiency, the studied high-income, upper middle-income, low-income and lower 
middle-income countries can improve health system outcomes by 6.6%, 8.6% and 
8.7%, respectively, using the existing level of resources. Population density, 
bed density, and primary education completion rate significantly influenced the 
efficiency score.
CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis showed inefficiency of the health 
systems in most of the Asian countries and imply that many countries may improve 
their health system efficiency using the current level of resources. The 
identified inefficient countries could pay attention to benchmarking their 
health systems within their income group or other within similar types of health 
systems.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of worldwide 
liver-related morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization released an 
integrated strategy targeting HCV-elimination by 2030. This study aims to 
estimate the required interventions to achieve elimination using updated 
information for direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment coverage, to compute the 
total costs (including indirect/societal costs) of the strategy and to identify 
whether the elimination strategy is cost-effective/cost-saving in Greece.
AIM: To estimate the required interventions and subsequent costs to achieve HCV 
elimination in Greece.
METHODS: A previously validated mathematical model was adapted to the Greek 
HCV-infected population to compare the outcomes of DAA treatment without the 
additional implementation of awareness or screening campaigns versus an HCV 
elimination strategy, which includes a sufficient number of treated patients. We 
estimated the total costs (direct and indirect costs), the disability-adjusted 
life years and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using two different 
price scenarios.
RESULTS: Without the implementation of awareness or screening campaigns, 
approximately 20000 patients would be diagnosed and treated with DAAs by 2030. 
This strategy would result in a 19.6% increase in HCV-related mortality in 2030 
compared to 2015. To achieve the elimination goal, 90000 patients need to be 
treated by 2030. Under the elimination scenario, viremic cases would decrease by 
78.8% in 2030 compared to 2015. The cumulative direct costs to eliminate the 
disease would range from 2.1-2.3 billion euros (€) by 2030, while the indirect 
costs would be €1.1 billion. The total elimination cost in Greece would range 
from €3.2-3.4 billion by 2030. The cost per averted disability-adjusted life 
year is estimated between €10100 and €13380, indicating that the elimination 
strategy is very cost-effective. Furthermore, HCV elimination strategy would 
save €560-895 million by 2035.
CONCLUSION: Without large screening programs, elimination of HCV cannot be 
achieved. The HCV elimination strategy is feasible and cost-saving despite the 
uncertainty of the future cost of DAAs in Greece.

OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes longitudinal trends in self-rated health (SRH) 
by taking age- and gender-specific differences into account.
METHODS: Data of 29,251 women and 26,967 men were obtained from the German 
Socio-Economic Panel between 1995 and 2014. Generalized Estimation Equation 
analysis for logistic regression was used to estimate changes in odds of (very) 
good SRH over time. Development of (un)healthy life expectancy was calculated by 
applying the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: While in women, the odds of good SRH increased significantly over time 
for the ages 41-50 to 71-80 years, improvements among men were most apparent for 
the ages 61-70 and 71-80 years. By contrast, for both genders, no improvements 
in SRH were found in the youngest (31-40 years) and eldest age group 
(81-90 years) and in men aging 51-60 years. Over time, healthy life expectancy 
at age 31 increased by 3 years in women and 2 years in men, leading to a reduced 
but not eliminated gender gap in SRH.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis of relative compression of 
morbidity. However, trends in SRH differed according to age and gender, calling 
for health promotion efforts that meet diverse needs at different stages of 
life.

PURPOSE: Due to increased life expectancy and a more active life style of the 
older people, we hypothesised that the incidence of quadriceps tendon rupture 
(QTR) is higher than previously reported. The objective of this nationwide 
population-based study was to investigate the annual incidence of QTR in 
patients who underwent operative treatment in Finland between 1997 and 2014.
METHODS: The Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register was searched for all 
adult patients who had undergone surgical treatment for QTR during the study 
period. Population-based annual incidence and incidence trends for surgically 
treated QTR were calculated.
RESULTS: During the study period, 1343 QTR surgeries were performed. Of these, 
90% were performed on male patients. The incidence of QTR increased by 411% from 
0.55 to 2.82 per 100,000 person-years from 1997 to 2014. The average yearly 
increase in the number of surgeries was 9.0%. In male patients, the incidence of 
QTR increased by 490% and in female patients by 121%. The mean age of the male 
patients increased during the study period from 50 to 59 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge 
Register, the annual incidence of QTR increased by over 400% during the 18-year 
study period. The average age of the patients also increased. Because QTR is 
only very rarely treated without surgery, the results of our study can be 
considered to be a reliable estimate of the increase in the incidence of this 
condition. There is an urgent need to establish the risk factors associated with 
QTR and to also establish the optimal surgical technique.

Hydroxyurea (HU) resistance or intolerance occurs in 15 to 24% of patients with 
polycythemia vera (PV). Resistance to HU is associated with a shortened life 
expectancy, intolerance has no prognostic value. We assessed the occurrence of 
HU resistance or intolerance comparing the original (ELNo) versus the modified 
European Leukemia Net (ELNm) criteria as applied in recent large clinical trials 
including PV patients. We retrospectively analyzed 106 patients with PV treated 
with HU at the University Hospitals of Leuven between 1990 and 2016 for 
occurrence of HU resistance/intolerance when using both ELNo as ELNm. After a 
mean duration of treatment of 5.1 years, when applying the ELNo 20.7% of 
patients had shown resistance or intolerance to HU in comparison to 39.6% when 
using the ELNm. When using the ELNo 4.7% of patients were resistant to HU versus 
23.6% when applying the ELNm. In total, 16.0% of patients were HU intolerant. 
This rate was identical when using both ELNo and ELNm. 20.7% of PV patients were 
considered as HU-resistant or intolerant when using the original ELN criteria. 
However, when applying the modified ELN criteria 39.6% of PV patients were 
resistant or intolerant to HU. In our hands, no patient received a minimum dose 
of 2 g HU a day, as such the ELNm seem better adapted for daily clinical use. 
However, the prognostic value of HU-resistance in PV, when defined by the ELNm, 
still needs to be confirmed.

OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of knowledge regarding whether decompression is 
necessary in treating patients with epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) 
grade 2. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of minimally 
invasive surgery (MIS) without decompression and conventional open surgery 
(palliative laminectomy) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) spinal 
metastasis of ESCC grade 2.
METHODS: Patients with HCC spinal metastasis requiring surgery were 
retrospectively reviewed. Patients with ESCC grade 2, medically intractable 
mechanical back pain, a Nurick grade better than 3, 3-6 months of life 
expectancy, Tomita score ≥5, and Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score ≥7 were 
included. Patients with neurological deficits, other systemic illnesses and less 
than 1 month of life expectancy were excluded. Thirty patients were included in 
the study, including 17 in the open surgery group (until 2008) and 13 in the MIS 
group (since 2009).
RESULTS: The MIS group had a significantly shorter operative time (94.2±48.2 
minutes vs. 162.9±52.3 minutes, p=0.001), less blood loss (140.0±182.9 mL vs. 
1534.4±1484.2 mL, p=0.002), and less post-operative intensive care unit transfer 
(one patient vs. eight patients, p=0.042) than the open surgery group. The 
visual analogue scale for back pain at 3 months post-operation was significantly 
improved in the MIS group than in the open surgery group (3.0±1.2 vs. 4.3±1.2, 
p=0.042). The MIS group had longer ambulation time (183±33 days vs. 166±36 days) 
and survival time (216±38 days vs. 204±43 days) than the open surgery group 
without significant difference (p=0.814 and 0.959, respectively).
CONCLUSION: MIS without decompression would be a good choice for patients with 
HCC spinal metastasis of ESCC grade 2, especially those with limited prognosis, 
mechanical instability and no neurologic deficit.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) has been associated with 
considerable physical, psychological and financial burden. However, its impact 
on health-related quality of life (QoL) and economic costs are not well studied.
OBJECTIVES: To measure the QoL impact and financial burden of CTCL.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 67 patients with CTCL was conducted using 
the Ontario Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) questionnaire. Normative 
population data (n = 3310) were obtained from the 2002-2003 Joint Canada/United 
States Survey of Health. Economic cost was estimated using quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) loss derived from HUI3 scores.
RESULTS: Patients with CTCL had significantly lower aggregate HUI3 scores than 
the general population (0·68 vs. 0·87, P < 0·001). Multivariable regression 
analysis adjusting for demographics and comorbidities showed CTCL was associated 
with significantly poorer performance overall (-0·13, 95% CI -0·21 to -0·06, 
P < 0·001) and in domains of speech (-0·03, 95% CI -0·05 to -0·01, P = 0·01), 
ambulation (-0·04, 95% CI -0·08 to 0·00, P = 0·03), emotion (-0·07, 95% CI -0·12 
to -0·02, P = 0·01), and pain (-0·07, 95% CI -0·13 to -0·01, P = 0·03). These 
health utility decrements yielded an average loss of 1·48 QALYs per patient. 
Using a $50 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, CTCL was associated with 
an individual lifetime burden of $73 889 and U.S. societal burden of $2·86 
billion.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest CTCL has a pervasive impact on QoL, 
comparable with debilitating conditions such as end-stage renal disease. The 
substantial economic burden of CTCL underscores the potential societal benefit 
of prompt diagnosis and effective management. What's already known about this 
topic? Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is associated with physical, psychological and 
financial burden. What does this study add? The overall quality-of-life impact 
of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma has not previously been measured using a generic 
health utility instrument. In this study, we compare the overall quality-of-life 
burden of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with that of other populations 
and calculate the economic burden of the disease.

Distancia (UNED), Madrid, Spain (JP, FJD), and School of Health and Related 
Research, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, UK.

Background. Several methods, such as the half-cycle correction and the 
life-table method, were developed to attenuate the error introduced in Markov 
models by the discretization of time. Elbasha and Chhatwal have proposed 
alternative "corrections" based on numerical integration techniques. They 
present an example whose results suggest that the trapezoidal rule, which is 
equivalent to the half-cycle correction, is not as accurate as Simpson's 1/3 and 
3/8 rules. However, they did not take into consideration the impact of 
discontinuities. Objective. To propose a method for evaluating Markov models 
with discontinuities. Design. Applying the trapezoidal rule, we derive a method 
that consists of adjusting the model by setting the cost at each point of 
discontinuity to the mean of the left and right limits of the cost function. We 
then take from the literature a model with a cycle length of 1 year and a 
discontinuity on the cost function and compare our method with other 
"corrections" using as the gold standard an equivalent model with a cycle length 
of 1 day. Results. As expected, for this model, the life-table method is more 
accurate than assuming that transitions occur at the beginning or the end of 
cycles. The application of numerical integration techniques without taking into 
account the discontinuity causes large errors. The model with averaged cost 
values yields very small errors, especially for the trapezoidal and the 1/3 
Simpson rules. Conclusion. In the case of discontinuities, we recommend applying 
the trapezoidal rule on an averaged model because this method has a mathematical 
justification, and in our empirical evaluation, it was more accurate than the 
sophisticated 3/8 Simpson rule.

AIM: To determine the contribution of avoidable causes of death to the life 
expectancy differentials in both Māori and Pacific compared with 
non-Māori/non-Pacific ethnic groups in New Zealand.
METHODS: Death registration data and population data for New Zealand between 
2013-15 was used to calculate life expectancy. A recent definition of avoidable 
mortality was used to identify potentially avoidable deaths. Life expectancy 
decomposition was undertaken to identify the contribution of avoidable causes of 
death to the life expectancy differential in the Māori and Pacific populations.
RESULTS: Nearly half of all deaths in Pacific (47.3%) and over half in Māori 
(53.0%) can be attributed to potentially avoidable causes of death, compared 
with less than one quarter (23.2%) in the non-Māori/non-Pacific population. 
Conditions both preventable and amenable contribute the greatest to the life 
expectancy differentials within both ethnic groups, when compared with 
non-Māori/non-Pacific. Cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung are significant 
avoidable causes contributing to the life expectancy differentials in both male 
and female Māori, contributing 0.8 years and 0.9 years respectively. Avoidable 
injuries including suicide contribute 1.0 year to the differential in Māori 
males. Coronary disease, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease are the largest 
contributors to the differential in both Pacific males and females.
CONCLUSION: Avoidable causes of death are large contributors to the life 
expectancy differentials in Māori and Pacific populations. The findings provide 
further evidence of the need to address the determinants of health and ensure 
equitable access to health services to reduce the impact of avoidable mortality 
on inequalities in life expectancy. It also highlights the importance of looking 
beyond individual factors and recognising the role of healthcare services and 
the social determinants in improving health equity.

INTRODUCTION: Health interventions implemented with self-help groups (SHGs) 
enhance the relevance and acceptability of the health services. The Parivartan 
program was implemented in eight districts of Bihar with women's self-help 
groups to increase adoption of maternal and newborn health behaviors through 
layering health behavior change communication. This study estimates the cost and 
cost-effectiveness of a health behavior change program with SHGs in Bihar.
METHODS: Cost analysis was conducted from a provider's perspective. All costs 
have been presented in US dollars for the purpose of international comparisons 
and converted to constant values. The effectiveness estimate was based on the 
reported changes in select newborn care practices. A decision model approach was 
used to estimate the potential number of neonatal deaths averted based on 
adoption of key newborn care practices. Using India's life expectancy of 65 
years, cost per life year saved was calculated. A one-way sensitivity analysis 
was conducted using the upper and lower estimates for various variables in the 
model, and functionality of SHGs.
RESULTS: The cost of forming an SHG group was US$254 and that of reaching a 
woman within the group was US$19. The unit cost for delivering health 
interventions through the Parivartan program was US$148 per group and US$11 per 
woman reached. During an 18 months period, Parivartan program reached around 
17,120 SHGs and an estimated 20,544 pregnant women resulting in an estimated 
prevention of 23 neonatal deaths at a cost of US$3,825 per life year saved.
CONCLUSION: SHGs can be an effective platform to increase uptake of women's 
health interventions and follow-up care, and also to broaden their utility 
beyond microfinance, particularly when they operate at a larger scale.

INTRODUCTION: Adult male and female mortality declines in Japan have been slower 
than in most high-income countries since the early 1990s. This study compares 
Japan's recent life expectancy trends with the more favourable trends in 
Australia, measures the contribution of age groups and causes of death to 
differences in these trends, and places the findings in the context of the 
countries' risk factor transitions.
METHODS: The study utilises data on deaths by age, sex and cause in Australia 
and Japan from 1950-2016 from the Global Burden of Disease Study. A 
decomposition method measures the contributions of various ages and causes to 
the male and female life expectancy gap and changes over four distinct phases 
during this period. Mortality differences by cohort are also assessed.
FINDINGS: Japan's two-year male life expectancy advantage over Australia in the 
1980s closed in the following 20 years. The trend was driven by ages 45-64 and 
then 65-79 years, and the cohort born in the late 1940s. Over half of 
Australia's gains were from declines in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, 
with lung cancer, chronic respiratory disease and self-harm also contributing 
substantially. Since 2011 the trend has reversed again, and in 2016 Japan had a 
slightly higher male life expectancy. The advantage in Japanese female life 
expectancy widened over the period to 2.3 years in 2016. The 2016 gap was mostly 
from differential mortality at ages 65 years and over from IHD, chronic 
respiratory disease and cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The considerable gains in Australian male life expectancy from 
declining non-communicable disease mortality are attributable to a range of risk 
factors, including declining smoking prevalence due to strong public health 
interventions. A recent reversal in life expectancy trends could continue 
because Japan has greater scope for further falls in smoking and far lower 
levels of obesity. Japan's substantial female life expectancy advantage however 
could diminish in future because it is primarily due to lower mortality at old 
ages.

BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in India is 
concentrated among 3.1 million men who have sex with men (MSM) and 1.1 million 
people who inject drugs (PWID), with a mean incidence of 0.9-1.4 per 100 
person-years. We examined the cost-effectiveness of both preexposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP) and HIV testing strategies for MSM and PWID in India.
METHODS: We populated an HIV microsimulation model with India-specific data and 
projected clinical and economic outcomes of 7 strategies for MSM/PWID, including 
status quo; a 1-time HIV test; routine HIV testing every 3, 6, or 12 months; and 
PrEP with HIV testing every 3 or 6 months. We used a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of US$1950, the 2017 Indian per capita gross domestic product, to 
define cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: HIV testing alone increased life expectancy by 0.07-0.30 years in MSM; 
PrEP added approximately 0.90 life-years to status quo. Results were similar in 
PWID. PrEP with 6-month testing was cost-effective for both MSM (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], $1000/year of life saved [YLS]) and PWID (ICER, 
$500/YLS). Results were most sensitive to HIV incidence. PrEP with 6-month 
testing would increase HIV-related expenditures by US$708 million (MSM) and 
US$218 million (PWID) over 5 years compared to status quo.
CONCLUSIONS: While the World Health Organization recommends PrEP with quarterly 
HIV testing, our analysis identifies PrEP with semiannual testing as the 
cost-effective HIV prevention strategy for Indian MSM and PWID. Since nationwide 
scale-up would require a substantial fiscal investment, areas of highest HIV 
incidence may be the appropriate initial targets for PrEP scale-up.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For the elderly, maintaining a young self-perceived 
age has a positive impact on physical and mental health. The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the impact of the discrepancy between self-perceived 
age and chronological age in regards to physical activity, instrumental 
activities of daily living, functional capacity, personality, general 
self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and disease burden.
METHODS: Participants were 3094 older adults from 2015 baseline data of the 
Keeping Active across Generations Uniting the Youth and the Aged study. The 
questionnaire was mailed to 8004 elderly people aged 65 years or older. Of the 
3871 people who returned the questionnaire (collection rate, 48.3%), 3094 
subjects were analyzed in this study (female, 52%). The questionnaire included 
aspects of physical activity, instrumental activity of daily living, functional 
capacity, personality traits, general self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, 
history of falls, fear of falling, communication with young people, medical 
history, and self-perceived age, as well as basic characteristics such as age, 
sex, living alone or not, and educational history.
RESULTS: Regression analysis showed that the presence of high self-rated health, 
personality traits of extraversion and openness to experience, higher general 
self-efficacy, and the presence of fear of falling were positively associated 
with a younger self-perceived age.
CONCLUSIONS: The results identified personality and psychological factors 
related to of self-perceived age in community-dwelling elderly people. 
Therefore, changes in personality traits and subjective health accompanying 
aging affect the self-perceived age, which may also affect the extension of 
healthy life expectancy.

Stowell Ave., Hobart 7000, Tasmania, Australia.

Blue grenadier filets ( Macruronus novaezelandiae ), pH 6.7, which had been 
stored frozen for 3 wk were thawed and repacked under vacuum and in air with and 
without the addition of 0.1% potassium sorbate. The effects of these treatments 
on microbial flora were noted after subsequent storage of the fillets at 4°C, 
Pseudomonads comprised >90% of the total flora of sorbate-treated fish, whereas 
Vibrio spp. (85%) and Moraxella spp. (70%) predominated in vacuum-packed and 
aerobically stored fillets, respectively. Sensory profiles of odor and flavor of 
the stored material were constructed. The acceptability of the aerobically 
stored fillets had significantly decreased after 7 d of storage. Vacuum 
packaging in conjunction with 0.1% potassium sorbate results in a minimal 
extension of shelf-life.

Shelf-Life Extension of Minced Beef Through Combined Treatments Involving 
Radurization.

The effect of addition of glucose, lactic acid (LA) as well as radurization on 
several bacterial groups in refrigerated beef was investigated. Glucose added to 
meat in concentrations of 2 to 10% (w/w) had little influence on the bacteria 
monitored. Addition of LA to a pH of 5 had a marked effect on several bacteria 
groups in meat; the effect became more pronounced during storage. An increased 
shelf life was obtained but the appearance of LA-treated samples was 
undesirable. Radurization (2.5 kGy) had a far greater effect on shelf life than 
any of the other treatments, although an overwhelming population of lactic acid 
bacteria developed toward the end of the storage period. Radurization also 
caused a significant increase in the shelf life in comparison to control, 
glucose-treated and LA-treated meat samples. A combiend treatment of 
radurization and LA had an even greater effect on the bacterial population and 
the shelf life of meat than that of the two separate treatments.
