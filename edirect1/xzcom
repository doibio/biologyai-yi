OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of human 
papillomavirus (HPV) primary screening triage with p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology 
compared to cytology.
METHODS: We conducted an Excel®-based budget impact model to estimate the 
preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer cases identified, mortality rate, 
direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness analysis of two strategies from the healthcare payer 
perspective. The study population is a cohort of women 30-65 years of age 
presenting for cervical screening.
RESULTS: HPV primary screening triage with p16/Ki-67 dual stain showed higher 
sensitivity without losing specificity compared to conventional Pap smear. The 
improving the screening performance leads to decrease the prevalence of 
precancerous lesion, annual incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. The 
incidence of cervical cancer case detected by new algorithm compared with 
conventional method were 31,607 and 38,927, respectively. In addition, the new 
algorithm was more effective and more costly (average QALY 24.03, annual cost 
$13,262,693) than conventional cytology (average QALY 23.98, annual cost 
$7,713,251). The incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) per QALY gained was 
$1,395. The sensitivity analysis showed if the cost of cytology and HPV test 
increased three times, the ICER would fall to $303/QALY gained and increased to 
$4,970/QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our model results suggest that screening by use of HPV genotyping 
test as a primary screening test combined with dual stain cytology as the triage 
of HPV positive women in Thai population 30-65 years old is expected to be more 
cost-effective than conventional Pap cytology.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression 
therapy accelerates venous leg ulcer healing and reduces ulcer recurrence. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of early 
versus delayed endovenous treatment of patients with venous leg ulcers.
METHODS: This was a within-trial cost-utility analysis with a 1-year time 
horizon using data from the EVRA (Early Venous Reflux Ablation) trial. The study 
compared early versus deferred endovenous ablation for superficial venous 
truncal reflux in patients with a venous leg ulcer. The outcome measure was the 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) over 1 year. Sensitivity analyses 
were conducted with alternative methods of handling missing data, alternative 
preference weights for health-related quality of life, and per protocol.
RESULTS: After early intervention, the mean(s.e.m.) cost was higher (difference 
in cost per patient £163(318) (€184(358))) and early intervention was associated 
with more QALYs at 1 year (mean(s.e.m.) difference 0·041(0·017)). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £3976 (€4482) per QALY. There 
was an 89 per cent probability that early venous intervention is cost-effective 
at a threshold of £20 000 (€22 546)/QALY. Sensitivity analyses produced similar 
results, confirming that early treatment of superficial reflux is highly likely 
to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Early treatment of superficial reflux is highly likely to be 
cost-effective in patients with venous leg ulcers over 1 year. Registration

Asthma is a disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, leading to 
intermittent symptoms of wheeze, dyspnea, cough and chest tightness in 
combination with variable expiratory airway obstruction. Clinical diagnosis is 
usually established based on the presence of symptoms and documented variability 
in expiratory airflow limitation as measured by pulmonary function testing. 
Presently, asthma is a major chronic disease affecting approximately 334 million 
people worldwide. The epidemic spares no age group, race or ethnicity; however 
ethnicity and socioeconomic status do influence the prevalence, morbidity and 
mortality of asthma in the United States and various countries throughout the 
world. Moreover, asthma places a huge burden at the societal, financial and 
health-care levels of multiple nations.

BACKGROUND: Quality of life is important at all ages, but maintaining a high 
quality of life is especially crucial to improve the functional capabilities of 
elder populations.
AIM: To investigate the relationship between quality of life and the functional 
capabilities of elderly Brazilian women participating in the Open University for 
senior citizens (UATI) in the state of Bahia, Brazil.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 51 elderly women was performed along 
with the completion of sociodemographic, WHO Quality of life - BREF 
(WHOQOL-BREF) and WHO Quality of life - OLD (WHOQOL-OLD) questionnaires, and 
standardized functional capacity tests.
RESULTS: The one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test showed interactions 
between functional capacity tests and the intimacy, autonomy, and death or dying 
domains of the WHOQOL-OLD.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the relationship between regular physical 
activity, improved functional capability, and quality of life, as demonstrated 
by better performances in the functional capacity tests resulting in a wider 
perception of quality of life for most of the senior women involved.

Diabetes mellitus affects over 20% of people aged > 65 years. With the 
population of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be 
only one of a number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity 
of their care, reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to 
self-care. Coexisting comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient 
and their healthcare team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely 
affect a person's diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the 
types of antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and 
sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be 
a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in 
diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal 
and liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose 
considerable challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical 
chemotherapy or glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be 
required. Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular 
and, to a lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these 
benefits take many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is 
lacking. Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of 
hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of 
diabetes is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered 
in the context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient 
wishes and expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney 
disease, chronic liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart 
disease, and frailty as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of 
hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Protein folding is a complex, multisystem process characterized by heavy 
molecular and cellular footprints. Chaperone machinery enables proper protein 
folding and stable conformation. Other pathways concomitant with the protein 
folding process include transcription, translation, post-translational 
modifications, degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and 
autophagy. As such, the folding process can go awry in several different ways. 
The pathogenic basis behind most neurodegenerative diseases is that the 
disruption of protein homeostasis (i.e. proteostasis) at any level will 
eventually lead to protein misfolding. Misfolded proteins often aggregate and 
accumulate to trigger neurotoxicity through cellular stress pathways and 
consequently cause neurodegenerative diseases. The manifestation of a disease is 
usually dependent on the specific brain region that the neurotoxicity affects. 
Neurodegenerative diseases are age-associated, and their incidence is expected 
to rise as humans continue to live longer and pursue a greater life expectancy. 
We presently review the sequelae of protein misfolding and aggregation, as well 
as the role of these phenomena in several neurodegenerative diseases including 
Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Parkinson's disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and 
spinocerebellar ataxia. Strategies for treatment and therapy are also conferred 
with respect to impairing, inhibiting, or reversing protein misfolding.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Microdiscectomy is a standard technique for the surgical 
treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Endoscopic discectomy (ED) is another 
surgical option that has become popular owing to reports of shorter 
hospitalization and earlier return to work. No study has evaluated health care 
costs associated with lumbar discectomy techniques and compared 
cost-effectiveness.
PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of four surgical techniques for LDH: 
microdiscectomy (MD), transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy (TELD), 
interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy (IELD), and unilateral biportal 
endoscopic discectomy (UBED).
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent either MD or ED for primary LDH with 
1-year follow-up between the ages of 20 and 60 years old.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
METHODS: Five hundred sixty-five patients aged 20-60 years who underwent 
treatment using one of the four surgical techniques with at least 1-year 
follow-up were reviewed. Health care costs were defined as the sum of direct and 
indirect costs. The former included the covered and uncovered costs of the 
National Health Insurance from operation to 1-year follow-up; indirect costs 
included costs incurred by work loss. Direct and indirect costs were evaluated 
separately. ICER was determined using cost/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Health care costs and ICER were compared statistically among the four surgical 
groups. Cost-effectiveness was compared statistically between MD and ED.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients who underwent TELD, 132 for IELD, 140 
for UBED, and 136 for MD were enrolled. The direct costs of TELD, IELD, UBED, 
and MD were $3,452.2±1,211.5, $3,907.3±895.3, $4,049.2±1,134.6, and 
$4,302.1±1,028.9, respectively (p<.01). The indirect costs of TELD, IELD, UBED, 
and MD were $574.5±495.9, $587.8±488.3, $647.4±455.6, and $759.7±491.7, 
respectively (p<.01). The 1-year QALY gains were 0.208 for TELD, 0.211 for IELD, 
0.194 for UBED, and 0.186 for MD. ICER (costs/QALY) was the highest for MD 
($34,840.4±25,477.9, p<.01). Compared with MD, ED saved an additional net of 
$8,064 per QALY (p<.01). There was no significant difference in the ICERs among 
the three endoscopic techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: ED was more cost-effective compared with MD at 1-year follow up.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant 
disorder that increases risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). We assessed changes in 
the incidence and prevalence of CRC, and survival times, of patients with FAP 
participating in the Danish follow-up study.
METHODS: We collected data from the Danish Polyposis Registry, a nationwide, 
complete registry of patients with FAP that includes clinical information, 
surgical procedures, follow-up findings, and pathology reports. We compared data 
between the periods of 1990-1999 and 2000-2017. In 2017, the registry contained 
226 families with 721 individuals with FAP. Probands were defined as patients 
diagnosed based on bowel symptoms, without any knowledge of hereditary bowel 
disease. Call-up patients were defined as those found to have FAP during 
screening and due to a diagnosis of FAP in first-degree relatives.
RESULTS: Although the mean incidence rate of FAP was stable from 1990-1999 
(0.19/100,000/year) to 2000-2017 (0.32/100,000/year) (P = .91), the point 
prevalence increased from 4.86/100,000 in 1999 to 6.11/100,000 by the end of 
2017 (P = .005). During 2000-2017, 25 of 72,218 CRC cases were associated with 
FAP (0.03%)-this was a significant decrease from 1990-1999 (26/30,005 cases; 
0.09%) (P = .001). The risk of CRC was significantly higher for probands 
(n = 191; 61.6%) than call-up cases (n = 5; 1.9%) (P < .001). All CRCs in 
call-up patients were detected at the diagnosis of FAP (no cases were identified 
in the follow-up program). The median life expectancy for call-up patients was 
72.0 years (95% CI, 63.3-80.7), compared to 55.0 years for probands (95% CI, 
51.2-58.8) (P < .001). Therefore, the tracing and follow-up program increased 
life expectancy by 17.0 years for first-degree family members.
CONCLUSION: The Danish Polyposis Registry enables close monitoring of patients 
with FAP, reducing risk of CRC and prolonging life.

The main goal of this study was to develop 
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) films with long-term 
antimicrobial capacity of interest in food packaging applications. To this end, 
eugenol was first highly efficiently encapsulated at 50 wt.-% in the pores of 
mesoporous silica nanoparticles by vapor adsorption. The eugenol-containing 
nanoparticles were then loaded in the 2.5⁻20 wt.-% range into PHBV by 
electrospinning and the resultant electrospun composite fibers were annealed at 
155 °C to produce continuous films. The characterization showed that the PHBV 
films filled with mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing eugenol present 
sufficient thermal resistance and enhanced mechanical strength and barrier 
performance to water vapor and limonene. The antimicrobial activity of the films 
was also evaluated against foodborne bacteria for 15 days in open vs. closed 
conditions in order to simulate real packaging conditions. The electrospun PHBV 
films with loadings above 10 wt.-% of mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing 
eugenol successfully inhibited the bacterial growth, whereas the active films 
stored in hermetically closed systems increased their antimicrobial activity 
after 15 days due to the volatile portion accumulated in the system's headspace 
and the sustained release capacity of the films. The resultant biopolymer films 
are, therefore, potential candidates to be applied in active food packaging 
applications to provide shelf life extension and food safety.

Objective: To assess the disease burden on uterine fibroids in China in 1990 and 
2016. Methods: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. 
Burdens of uterine fibrosis among different age groups and provinces were 
measured in 1990 and 2016, with key indicators including number of cases, 
prevalence rates, disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and the rates of DALY. 
The WHO world standard population, 2010-2035 was used to calculate the age- 
standardized rates. Results: In 1990 and 2016, there were 13 695 567 and 27 169 
312 women aged 15 years and older, suffered from uterine fibrosis respectively, 
with prevalence rate as 2.48% and 4.10%, DALY as 146 045.05 life years and 281 
976.67 life years, and the DALY rate as 26.40/100 000 and 42.50/100 000, in 1990 
and 2016 respectively. Both the prevalence rate and the DALY rate increased with 
age, reaching the peak on the 45-49 years-old, in both 1990 and 2016. Women aged 
40-54 years accounted for 55.60% (1990) and 66.74% (2016) of the total cases 
while 48.37% (1990) and 60.65% (2016) of the total DALY. The first three 
provinces with highest DALYs were Shandong (1990: 12 574.67 life year; 2016: 22 
728.12 life year), Henan (1990: 10 849.29 life year; 2016: 18 454.32 life year) 
and Jiangsu (1990: 10 501.55 life year; 2016: 18 274.10 life year), while the 
three provinces with leading standardized DALY rates were Heilongjiang (1990: 
48.20/100 000; 2016: 47.00/100 000), Shanxi (1990: 44.50/100 000; 2016: 
47.70/100 000) and Tianjin (1990: 43.80/100 000; 2016: 46.40/100 000) in both 
1990 and 2016. Compared with 1990, the number of cases with uterine fibroids 
increased by 13 473 745 (with rate of change as: 98.38%), standardized 
prevalence rate increased by 1.88%, DALY value increased by 135 931.62 life 
years (with the rate of change as 93.08%) and standardized DALY rate increased 
by 5.92% among Chinese women, in 2016. Conclusion: Menopausal women were the 
ones hard hit by uterine fibrosis. Compared with data from 1990, the disease 
burden of uterine fibrosis increased rapidly in China, in 2016.

Objective: From the economic point of view, this study was to systematically 
assess the status quo on lung cancer screening in the world and to provide 
reference for further research and implementation of the programs, in China. 
Methods: PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library,CNKI and Wanfang Data were 
searched to gather papers on studies related to economic evaluation regarding 
lung cancer screening worldwide, from the inception of studies to June 30(th), 
2018. Basic characteristics, methods and main results were extracted. Quality of 
studies was assessed. Cost were converted to Chinese Yuan under the exchange 
rates from the World Bank. The ratio of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) to local GDP per capita were calculated. Results: A total of 23 studies 
(only 1 randomized controlled trial) were included and the overall quality was 
accepted. 22 studies were from the developed countries. Nearly half of the 
studies (11 studies) took 55 years old as the starting age of the screening 
program. Smoking history was widely applied for the selection of criteria on 
target populations (18). Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was involved in 
every study used to evaluate the economic effectiveness. Annual (17) and 
once-life time (7) screening were more common frequencies. 22 studies reported 
ICERs for LDCT screening, compared to no screening, of which 17 were less than 3 
times local GDP per capita, and were considered as cost-effectiveness, according 
to the WHO's recommendation. 15 and 7 studies reported ICERs for annual and 
once-life time screening, of which 12 and 7 studies were in favor the results of 
their cost-effectiveness, respectively. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of 
once-lifetime screening was likely to be superior to the annual screening. 
Differences of cost-effectiveness among the subgroups, by starting age or by the 
smoking history, might exist. Conclusions: Based on the studies, evidence from 
the developed countries demonstrated that LDCT screening programs on lung 
cancer, implemented among populations selected by age and smoking history, 
generally appeared more cost-effective. Combined with the local situation of 
health resource, the findings could provide direction for less developed 
regions/countries lacking of local evidence. Low frequency of LDCT screening for 
lung cancer could be adopted when budget was limited. Data on starting ages, 
smoking history and other important components related to the strategy of 
screening programs, needs to be precisely evaluated under the situation of local 
population.

系统检索PubMed、EMbase、The Cochrane 
Library、中国知网及万方数据知识服务平台自建库至2018年6月30日间肺癌筛查卫生经济学研究相关文献，摘录其经济学评价方法及结果等信息，并进行质量评价。成本统一货币单位后计算增量成本效果比（ICER）后计算与当年当地人均GDP比值。 
结果： 
共纳入23项研究（1项基于人群随机对照试验，20项完全基于模型评价），整体质量较好；22项来自发达国家，11项筛查起始年龄为55岁，18项目标人群考虑了吸烟史；评价的筛查技术全部涉及低剂量螺旋CT（LDCT），筛查频率以每年1次（17项）和终生1次（7项）居多。22项研究可获得与未筛查相比的ICER，其中17项研究报道的ICER低于3倍当年当地人均GDP。各有15项和7项研究可获得每年1次和终生1次的ICER，其中各有12项和7项支持其经济有效，且终生1次略优于每年1次；不同筛查起始年龄和吸烟包年的经济有效性优劣差异不明显。 
结论： 
发达国家多开展基于模型LDCT肺癌筛查卫生经济学评价，并结合年龄和吸烟史进行高危人群选择，初步提示该方案经济有效；可为证据有限的欠发达地区提供参考，但实施需结合当地卫生资源现状；预算有限时低频次LDCT筛查更佳，而筛查起始年龄和吸烟史等细节确定需结合人群特征进行精准评价。.

BACKGROUND: Voriconazole is well established as standard treatment for invasive 
aspergillosis (IA). In 2017, isavuconazole, a new antifungal from the azole 
class, with a broader pathogen spectrum, was introduced in Sweden. A model has 
therefore been developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole and 
voriconazole in the treatment of possible IA in adults in Sweden.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole versus voriconazole was 
evaluated using a decision-tree model. Patients with possible IA entered the 
model, with 6% assumed to actually have mucormycosis. It was also assumed that 
pathogen information would become available during the course of treatment for 
only 50% of patients, with differential diagnosis unavailable for the remainder. 
Patients who were considered unresponsive to first-line treatment were switched 
to second-line treatment with liposomal amphotericin-B. Data and clinical 
definitions included in the model were taken from the published randomised 
clinical trial comparing isavuconazole with voriconazole for the treatment of IA 
and other filamentous fungi (SECURE) and the single-arm, open-label trial and 
case-control analysis of isavuconazole for the treatment of mucormycosis 
(VITAL). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the combined 
parameter uncertainty, and a deterministic sensitivity analysis and a scenario 
analysis were performed to test the robustness of the model assumptions. The 
model followed a Swedish healthcare payer perspective, therefore only 
considering direct medical costs.
RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that isavuconazole resulted in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 174,890 Swedish krona (SEK) per 
additional quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This was mainly due to the 
efficacy of isavuconazole against IA and mucormycosis, as opposed to 
voriconazole, which is only effective against IA. Sensitivity and scenario 
analyses of the data showed that the average ICER consistently fell below the 
willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 1,000,000 SEK. The probability of 
isavuconazole being cost-effective at a WTP of 170,000 SEK per QALY gained was 
50% and at a WTP of 500,000 SEK per QALY gained was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that the treatment of possible IA with 
isavuconazole is cost-effective compared with treatment with voriconazole from a 
Swedish healthcare payer perspective.

Sciences,Aichi,Japan.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to clarify the global relationship 
between Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and the incidence of IHD by country using 
international statistics.
DESIGN: The incidence of IHD by country was derived from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) database. Average supplies of food (g/d per capita) and energy 
(kcal/d per capita) by country, excluding loss between production and household, 
were obtained from the FAOSTAT database. MDS was evaluated based on the total 
score of nine food items that characterize the Mediterranean diet. The 
association between MDS and the incidence of IHD was examined in countries with 
a population of 1 million or greater using a general linear model controlled for 
socio-economic and lifestyle variables.
SETTING: Population data from global international databases.ParticipantsOne 
hundred and thirty-two countries with a population of over 1 million.
RESULTS: MDS was inversely correlated with obesity rate, ageing rate, years of 
education and IHD incidence; however, no associations were found with gross 
domestic product, life expectancy, smoking rate, energy supply or health 
expenditure. In the general linear model of IHD incidence by MDS controlled for 
socio-economic and lifestyle variables, the β of the MDS was -26·4 (se 8·6; 
P&lt;0·01).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this global international comparative study 
confirmed that the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with the incidence 
of IHD.

Advances in the treatment of cancer in young patients have led to great 
improvements in life expectancy, which currently approaches 80% 5-year survival 
rate. As a result, fertility preservation and desire for paternity have become a 
significant issue in this group. However, a major concern is the negative impact 
of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and the malignancy itself on fertility. Thus, men 
about to have treatment for malignant conditions may have sperm cryopreserved 
before commencing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Ejaculated sperm 
cryopreservation is the most common technique used. Some patients with cancer 
may present initially with oligospermia or azoospermia. In cases when a sample 
is not produced due to medical, social, or religious reasons, sperm can be 
retrieved using penile vibratory stimulation, electroejaculation, or testicular 
sperm extraction. Fertility preservation in prepubertal boys presents a great 
challenge, as sperm banking is not possible. Alternative strategies have been 
developed, but all are currently experimental.

Comment in
    Curr Biol. 2019 Mar 18;29(6):R215-R218.

Recent advances in medicine and life-expectancy gains have fueled 
multidisciplinary research into the limits of human lifespan [1-3]. Ultimately, 
how long humans can live for may depend on selection favoring extended longevity 
in our evolutionary past [4]. Human females have an unusually extended 
post-reproductive lifespan, which has been explained by the fitness benefits 
provided from helping to raise grandchildren following menopause [5, 6]. 
However, formal tests of whether such grandmothering benefits wane with 
grandmother age and explain the observed length of post-reproductive lifespan 
are missing. This is critical for understanding prevailing selection pressures 
on longevity but to date has been overlooked as a possible mechanism driving the 
evolution of lifespan. Here, we use extensive data from pre-industrial humans to 
show that fitness gains from grandmothering are dependent on grandmother age, 
affecting selection on the length of post-reproductive lifespan. We find both 
opportunities and ability to help grandchildren declined with age, while the 
hazard of death of women increased greatly in their late 60s and 70s compared to 
menopausal ages, together implying waning selection on subsequent longevity. The 
presence of maternal grandmothers aged 50-75 increased grandchild survival after 
weaning, confirming the fitness advantage of post-reproductive lifespan. 
However, co-residence with paternal grandmothers aged 75+ was detrimental to 
grandchild survival, with those grandmothers close to death and presumably in 
poorer health particularly associated with lower grandchild survival. The age 
limitations of gaining inclusive fitness from grandmothering suggests that 
grandmothering can select for post-reproductive longevity only up to a certain 
point.

In a context of perpetual evolution of treatments, access to therapeutic 
innovation is a major challenge for patients and the various players involved in 
the procedures of access to medicines. The revolutions in genomic and 
personalized medicine, artificial intelligence and biotechnology will transform 
the medicine of tomorrow and the organization of our health system. It is 
therefore fundamental that France prepares for these changes and supports the 
development of its companies in these new areas. The recent "Conseil stratégique 
des industries de santé" launched by Matignon makes it possible to propose a 
regulatory arsenal conducive to the implementation and diffusion of therapeutic 
innovations. In this workshop, we present a number of proposals, our approach 
having remained pragmatic with a permanent concern to be effective in the short 
term for the patients and to simplify the procedures as much as possible. This 
was achieved thanks to the participation in this workshop of most of the players 
involved (industrial companies, "Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et 
des produits de santé", "Haute Autorité de santé", "Institut national du 
cancer", "Les entreprises du médicament", hospitals, "Observatoire du 
médicament, des dispositifs médicaux et de l'innovation thérapeutique"…). The 
main proposals tend to favor the implementation of clinical trials on our 
territory, especially the early phases, a wider access to innovations by 
favoring early access programs and setting up a process called "autorisation 
temporaire d'utilisation d'extension" (ATUext) that make it possible to 
prescribe a medicinal product even if the latter has a marketing authorisation 
in another indication. In addition, we propose a conditional reimbursement that 
will be available based on preliminary data but will require re-evaluation based 
on consolidated data from clinical trials and/or real-life data. Finally, in 
order to better carry out these assessments, with a view to access or care, we 
propose the establishment of partnership agreements with health 
agencies/hospitals in order to encourage the emergence of field experts, in 
order to prioritize an ascending expertise closer to patients' needs and to real 
life.

PURPOSE: To investigate tolerability, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of Debio 1347, a selective FGFR inhibitor.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label study 
in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring FGFR1-3 gene alterations. 
Eligible patients received oral Debio 1347 at escalating doses once daily until 
disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were 
evaluated during the first 4 weeks on treatment, 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics postfirst dose and after 4 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were screened and 58 treated with Debio 1347 at 
doses from 10 to 150 mg/day. Predominant tumor types were breast and biliary 
duct cancer, most common gene alterations were FGFR1 amplifications (40%) and 
mutations in FGFR2 (12%) and FGFR3 (17%); 12 patients (21%) showed FGFR fusions. 
Five patients at three dose levels had six DLTs (dry mouth/eyes, 
hyperamylasemia, hypercalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperphosphatemia, and 
stomatitis). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, but dermatologic 
toxicity became sometimes dose limiting beyond the DLT period at ≥80 mg/day. 
Adverse events required dose modifications in 52% of patients, mostly due to 
dose-dependent, asymptomatic hyperphosphatemia (22%). RECIST responses were seen 
across tumor types and mechanisms of FGFR activation. Six patients, 3 with FGFR 
fusions, demonstrated partial responses, 10 additional patients' tumor size 
regressions of ≤30%. Plasma half-life was 11.5 hours. Serum phosphate increased 
with Debio 1347 plasma levels and confirmed target engagement at doses ≥60 
mg/day.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary efficacy was encouraging and tolerability acceptable up 
to 80 mg/day, which is now used in an extension part of the study.

BACKGROUND: Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye. The objective of this study 
is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a dexamethasone implant plus current 
practice (immunosuppressants and systemic corticosteroids) compared with current 
practice alone, in patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior or 
pan-uveitis and to identify areas for future research.
METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the costs and benefits of 
dexamethasone. Systematic reviews were performed to identify available relevant 
evidence. Quality of life data from the key randomised-controlled trial (HURON) 
was used to estimate the interventions' effectiveness compared with the trial's 
comparator arm (placebo plus limited current practice (LCP)). The analysis took 
a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Costs were 
calculated based on standard UK sources.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of one dexamethasone 
implant compared with LCP is estimated as £19 509 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. The factors with the largest impact on the results were rate of 
blindness and relative proportion of blindness cases avoided by dexamethasone. 
Using plausible alternative assumptions, dexamethasone could be cost saving or 
it may be associated with an ICER of £56 329 per QALY gained compared with LCP.
CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone is estimated to be cost-effective using generally 
accepted UK thresholds. However, there is substantial uncertainty around these 
results due to scarcity of evidence. Future research on the following would help 
provide more reliable estimates: effectiveness of dexamethasone versus current 
practice (instead of LCP), with subgroup analyses for unilateral and bilateral 
uveitis, incidence of long-term blindness and effectiveness of dexamethasone in 
avoiding blindness.
