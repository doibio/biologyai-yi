BACKGROUND: Adequate sleep is essential for health. Both, short and long sleep 
durations are associated to worse quality of life and poor health outcomes. 
Portugal represents a specific population model, since according to European 
statistics it has high rates of chronic diseases like depression, hypertension, 
diabetes and stroke; and low quality of life as well as low index of physical 
activity, while in parallel it has some other good health indicators such as: 
low age-standardized mortality for both genders, nutrition in terms of energy 
and fruit consumption, smoking and alcohol, obesity and overweight prevalence. 
The aim of this study was to characterize health and chronic diseases, 
lifestyles and quality of life in subjects with short and long sleep duration.
METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional evaluation of the third wave of 
follow-up of the EpiDoC Cohort was carried between 2015-2016. A sample of 5,436 
adults ≥18 years, representative of the national population, self-reported their 
daily total sleep time. Associations between short sleep duration (SSD ≤5h), 
long sleep duration (LSD≥9h) and independent variables were determined.
RESULTS: The prevalence for SSD was high (20.7%) and the LSD (5.9%) was low. 
Being older, with lower education, retired and unemployed were associated to SSD 
and LSD (p<0.01). Being obese was associated to SSD as well as hypertension, 
gastrointestinal disease and hypercholesterolemia (p<0.01). SSD and LSD, were 
associated with diabetes (p<0.01 and p=0.03) and depression (p<0.01 and p=0.02) 
respectively. Cardiovascular disease (p<0.01) was associated to LSD. 
Multimorbidity (p<0.01) was associated to SSD. Worse quality of life and bad 
physical function were associated to SSD and LSD, as well as being hospitalized 
in the previous 12 months (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographic, physical activity and chronic diseases were 
associated to reduction and extension of sleep duration. There was no 
association between rheumatic diseases and cancer with sleep duration, as found 
in other studies. This study emphasizes the burden of self-reported SSD for 
Portugal, its consequences to health and the need to increase sleep awareness 
campaigns enhancing the importance of sleep in health. Furthermore, it 
emphasizes that chronic diseases risks are dependent on multiple parameters 
which varying in different countries or regions, imply the need of regional 
studies and interventions.

Background. Reference life expectancies inform frequently used health metrics, 
which play an integral role in determining resource allocation and health policy 
decision making. Existing reference life expectancies are not able to account 
for variation in geographies, populations, and disease states. Using a computer 
simulation, we developed a reference life expectancy estimation that considers 
competing causes of mortality, and is tailored to population characteristics. 
Methods. We developed a Monte Carlo microsimulation model that explicitly 
represented the top causes of US mortality in 2014 and the risk factors 
associated with their onset. The microsimulation follows a birth cohort of 
hypothetical individuals resembling the population of the United States. To 
estimate a reference life expectancy, we compared current circumstances with an 
idealized scenario in which all modifiable risk factors were eliminated and 
adherence to evidence-based therapies was perfect. We compared estimations of 
years of potential years life lost with alternative approaches. Results. In the 
idealized scenario, we estimated that overall life expectancy in the United 
States would increase by 5.9 years to 84.7 years. Life expectancy for men would 
increase from 76.4 years to 82.5 years, and life expectancy for women would 
increase from 81.3 years to 86.8 years. Using age-75 truncation to estimate 
potential years life lost compared to using the idealized life expectancy 
underestimated potential health gains overall (38%), disproportionately 
underestimated potential health gains for women (by 70%) compared to men (by 
40%), and disproportionately underestimated the importance of heart disease for 
white women and black men. Conclusion. Mathematical simulations can be used to 
estimate an idealized reference life expectancy among a population to better 
inform and assess progress toward targets to improve population health.

This paper provides an educational review covering the consideration of costs 
for cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), summarising relevant methods and research 
from the published literature. Cost data are typically generated by applying 
appropriate unit costs to healthcare resource-use data for patients. Trial-based 
evaluations and decision analytic modelling represent the two main vehicles for 
CEA. The costs to consider will depend on the perspective taken, with 
conflicting recommendations ranging from focusing solely on healthcare to the 
broader 'societal' perspective. Alternative sources of resource-use are 
available, including medical records and forms completed by researchers or 
patients. Different methods are available for the statistical analysis of cost 
data, although consideration needs to be given to the appropriate methods, given 
cost data are typically non-normal with a mass point at zero and a long 
right-hand tail. The choice of covariates for inclusion in econometric models 
also needs careful consideration, focusing on those that are influential and 
that will improve balance and precision. Where data are missing, it is important 
to consider the type of missingness and then apply appropriate analytical 
methods, such as imputation. Uncertainty around costs should also be reflected 
to allow for consideration on the impacts of the CEA results on decision 
uncertainty. Costs should be discounted to account for differential timing, and 
are typically inflated to a common cost year. The choice of methods and sources 
of information used when accounting for cost information within CEA will have an 
effect on the subsequent cost-effectiveness results and how information is 
presented to decision makers. It is important that the most appropriate methods 
are used as overlooking the complicated nature of cost data could lead to 
inaccurate information being given to decision makers.

BACKGROUND: The economic evaluation of treatments usually requires access to 
individual patient data, which is difficult to obtain. Moreover, in 
osteoarthritis, health utility scores are unavailable and can be assessed only 
using a validated equation model based on various clinical data. We aimed to 
develop and validate a methodology to simulate individual health utility scores 
from aggregated clinical data available in published studies to calculate the 
cost-effectiveness of different glucosamine preparations (i.e., crystalline 
glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, and glucosamine hydrochloride) used 
for osteoarthritis.
METHODS: We developed a method to simulate individual utility values and 
validated the model by comparing the results obtained with the simulation and 
the results of one trial where the utility scores are available. Then, we 
simulated the utility scores of 10 published trials that used different 
glucosamine preparations. The utility estimates were used to calculate the 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using the area-under-the-curve method. Costs 
were for the glucosamine product only. The incremental cost/effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was then calculated.
RESULTS: The values of utility scores calculated from data sources and those 
simulated with the model were similar. From 10 studies where utility was 
simulated, four used crystalline glucosamine sulfate, and six used other 
formulations. The ICER revealed that compared to placebo, crystalline 
glucosamine sulfate only was cost-effective at all time points and up to 3 years 
with a median ICER of 5347.2 €/QALY at month 3, 4807.2 €/QALY at month 6 and 
11535.5 €/QALY at year 3. The use of other formulations was not cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Using a new model to simulate individual health utility scores of 
patients included in ten published trials, ICER analysis showed that the use of 
crystalline glucosamine sulfate is cost-effective, while other formulations were 
not. The results confirm the importance of the formulation of glucosamine 
products.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs, effects, and cost-utility of an accelerated 
physiotherapy programme versus a standard physiotherapy programme following 
resurfacing hip arthroplasty.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: A UK National Health Service hospital and patients' homes.
SUBJECTS: A total of 80 male resurfacing hip arthroplasty patients randomized 
post procedure to one of the two programmes.
INTERVENTIONS: The accelerated physiotherapy programme commenced in hospital 
with patients being fully weight bearing, without hip precautions, and following 
a range of exercises facilitating gait re-education, balance, and lower limb 
strength. Standard physiotherapy commenced in hospital, but hip precautions were 
used and exercises were only partially weight bearing. In both groups, patients 
continued with their exercises at home for an eight-week period.
MAIN MEASURES: Data on healthcare contacts were collected from patients to 
12 months and costed using unit costs from national sources. Information was 
also collected on patients' costs. Health-related quality of life was measured 
using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire and used to estimate quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) to 12 months. Mean costs and QALYs for each trial arm were 
compared.
RESULTS: On average, the accelerated physiotherapy programme was less expensive 
(mean cost difference -£200; 95% confidence interval: -£656 to £255) and more 
effective (mean QALY difference 0.13; 95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.21) 
than standard physiotherapy and had a high probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: From the National Health Service perspective, an accelerated 
physiotherapy programme for male patients undergoing revision of total hip 
arthroplasty (RHA) is very likely to be cost-effective when compared to a 
standard physiotherapy programme.

Primary prevention of cardiovascular events in older adults is a relevant 
problem, due to lack of evidence for safe and efficacious therapy, its costs and 
elderly quality of life, Italy's aging population is constantly increasing, so 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) primary prevention in the elderly is a prime 
objective. Life expectancy has dramatically increased over the last 2 decades, 
the proportion of individuals aged 80 years and older has grown rapidly in 
Europe and the United States, but cost / effective ratio of CVD prevention 
through risk factors control is debated. It is therefore important to implement 
cardiovascular risk factors estimation in the elderly to maximize the quality of 
life of patients and to lengthen their healthy life expectancy, choosing the 
better treatment for each patient sharing the choice with himself when it is 
possible, always remembering that elderly patients often have multiple 
co-morbidities that require a high number of concurrent medications; this may 
increase the risk for drug-drug interactions, thereby reducing the potential 
benefits of CVD prevention therapy. Nevertheless, CVD is not an inevitable 
concomitant of aging. Sometimes, autopsy in the elderly reveals atheroma-free 
coronary arteries, a normal-sized heart and unscarred valves. All primary 
prevention strategy decisions should consider estimated life expectancy and 
overall function and not just the cardiovascular event risks, magnitude and time 
to benefit or harm, potentially altered adverse effect profiles, and informed 
patient preferences. CVD primary prevention needs to be more implemented in the 
elderly, this might contribute to improve health status and quality of life in 
this growing population if correctly performed.

PURPOSE: Individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) have more health 
problems, a poorer general health, and a shorter life expectancy than 
individuals in general. High rates of drug use in IDs have been reported. 
Despite the increasing interest in health problems in individuals with IDs, 
little is known about their drug use.
METHOD: Drug use in a community sample of adults with IDs (N = 593) was compared 
with dispensed drugs in a time-, age-, and region-matched comparison group of 
adults in Western Norway (N = 289 325). A logistic regression model was employed 
by using the main group effect to describe and analyze the differences between 
the ID sample and the comparison sample and by using the interaction term 
(group × age) to describe the rate change differences from the reference age 
(18-30 years) between the two groups.
RESULTS: Total drug use in the ID sample was 62% compared with 50% in the 
reference sample (P = 0.0001). The high prevalence of drugs for the nervous 
system (ATC N) in the ID sample (50%) explained the difference. From age 51 and 
over, the increase in the drug use rate for the cardiovascular disease was 
significantly lower in the ID sample than in the reference sample (P value 
range: 0.002-0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with IDs use more drugs than adults in general. However, the 
findings showed lower rates of drug use in the ID sample than in the general 
population for drugs targeting diseases that are the leading causes of death in 
individuals with IDs.

BACKGROUND: Objective was to measure preventable premature loss of life in 
countries from same geographical area but with considerable differences in 
social and economic development. By comparing inter-country differences and 
similarities in premature mortality, acceleration of health-in-all-policies is 
enhanced.
METHODS: Preventable premature deaths were described by Potential Years of Life 
Lost (PYLL). Data consisted of death registers for 2003, 2009 and 2013. 
PYLL-rates were age-standardized by using standard OECD population from 1980 and 
expressed as sum of lost life years per 100 000 citizens.
RESULTS: In Northern Dimension area, PYLL-rates had declined from 2003 to 2013. 
In 2013, worst PYLL-rate was in Belarus 9851 and best in Sweden 2511. PYLL-rates 
among men were twice as high as among women. Most premature losses (1023) were 
due to external causes. Malignant neoplasms came second (921) and vascular 
diseases third (816). Alcohol was also an important cause (270) and country 
differences were over 10-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: In ND-area, the overall development of public health has been good 
during 2003-13. Nevertheless, for all countries foci for public health 
improvement and learning from each other could be identified. Examining the 
health of populations in countries from relatively similar geographical area 
with different social history and cultures can provide them with evidence-based 
tools for health-in-all-policies to advocate health promotion and disease 
prevention. Gender differences due to preventable premature deaths are striking. 
The higher the national PYLL-rate, the bigger the PYLL-rate difference between 
men and women and the loss of human capital.

OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to evaluate the outcomes of the first patients treated 
by venous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary 
interventions (PCIs) with balloon angioplasty at a single centre who have 
reached up to 40 years of life-long follow-up.
METHODS: We analysed the outcomes of the first consecutive patients who 
underwent (venous) CABG (n = 1041) from 1971 to 1980 and PCI (n = 856) with 
balloon angioplasty between 1980 and 1985. Follow-up was successfully achieved 
in 98% of patients (median 39 years, range 36-46) who underwent CABG and in 97% 
(median 33 years, range 32-36) of patients who had PCI.
RESULTS: The median age was 53 years in the CABG cohort and 57 years in the PCI 
cohort. A total of 82% of patients in the CABG group and 37% of those in the PCI 
group had multivessel coronary artery disease. The cumulative survival rates at 
10, 20, 30 and 40 years were 77%, 39%, 14% and 4% after CABG, respectively, and 
at 10, 20, 30 and 35 years after PCI were 78%, 47%, 21% and 12%, respectively. 
The estimated life expectancy after CABG was 18 and 17 years after the PCI 
procedures. Repeat revascularization was performed in 36% and 57% of the 
patients in the CABG and PCI cohorts, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This unique life-long follow-up analysis demonstrates that both 
CABG and PCI were excellent treatment options immediately after their 
introduction as the standard of care. These procedures were lifesaving, thereby 
indirectly enabling patients to be treated with newly developed methods and 
medical therapies during the follow-up years.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: It is not known if diets lower in greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions are also healthier. We evaluated the population health implications of 
changing to more sustainable diets in the UK, France, Finland, Italy and Sweden.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: We developed a life table model to simulate mortality and 
morbidity from diet-related diseases over the lifetime of the current 
population. Populating the model with locally available data for each country, 
we simulated the impact of country-specific dietary scenarios that had been 
optimised to meet dietary recommendations and reduce GHG emissions. Outcome 
measures included a change in disease-specific deaths, life expectancy and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: Diets that meet nutritional recommendations lead to substantial 
improvements in population health, ranging from 0.19 (95% uncertainty interval: 
0.18-0.21) DALYs per person in Italy up to 0.89 (0.80-0.98) DALYs per person in 
Finland. Simultaneously reducing GHG emissions does not reduce the size of this 
impact, and in some cases produces additional health benefits. If sustainable 
diets can be maintained throughout adulthood, life expectancy would increase by 
between 2.3 (1.6-3.2) and 6.8 (5.5-8.5) months by country. However, results are 
sensitive to assumptions about how quickly changes in diet can influence 
disease, and future trends in disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Modelling the health impact of diets that are both nutritional and 
low in GHG emissions shows the potential for significant co-benefits in health 
and sustainability from dietary changes. Future work is needed to find effective 
interventions to deliver healthy sustainable diets.

Aiweixin (AWX) is a traditional Uyghur medicine prescription, which has been 
used to treat senile diseases for a long time. We investigate whether the AWX 
extends the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. The AWX decoction was the 
conventional product for clinical use. The wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans (N2) 
and mutational worms, daf-16(mu86), glp-1(e2141), daf-2(e1370), and 
eat-2(ad465), were applied for the lifespan analysis. We found that the lifespan 
of the N2 adults' worm received 0.005 and 0.01 volume of AWX/total volume was 
extended significantly, compared to the control without treatment of AWX. The 
AWX at 0.01 volume of AWX/total volume significantly prolonged the life of both 
mutational worms, daf-16 (mu86) and eat-2(ad465), but did not increase the 
lifespan of the mutational worms, daf-2(e1370) and glp-1(e2141). These results 
indicated that the AWX significantly extended the lifespan of wild-type 
nematodes, and the life extension effect of AWX was related to the germline 
longevity pathway and IIS signaling pathway but independent of DAF-16/FOXO.

Boerhaave syndrome is rare, has an non-specific clinical presentation and most 
commonly develops after persistent vomiting. Septic shock dominates the clinical 
picture as a result of extensive infection of the mediastinum and pleural and 
abdominal cavities. The current management of Boerhaave syndrome includes 
conservative, endoscopic and surgical treatments. The authors present the case 
of a 94-year-old man admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia with 
mild respiratory insufficiency complicated by oesophageal perforation after an 
episode of vomiting and the development of a large left pleural effusion. An 
endoscopic approach with the placement of an oesophageal prosthesis was chosen 
given the advanced age of the patient. The hospital stay was complicated by 
pleural effusion infection requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics and prosthesis 
substitution. The patient was discharged after 60 days of hospitalization, 
without the need for oxygen supplementation, and scoring 80% on the Karnofsky 
Performance Status Scale. The increase in average life expectancy requires a 
case-by-case approach, where the benefits of invasive manoeuvres and likelihood 
of discharge are weighed against an acceptable quality of life, aiming to 
prevent futile medical treatment.
LEARNING POINTS: Boerhaave syndrome is a complete rupture of the oesophageal 
wall secondary to a sudden increase in intraluminal oesophageal pressure, often 
in the lower third and left lateral position of the oesophagus.The management of 
Boerhaave syndrome depends on the time of diagnosis and clinical presentation 
and includes conservative, endoscopic and surgical approaches.Curative, 
aggressive approaches focused on the treatment of disease are often not 
appropriate for an aging population, hence the need for a case-by-case approach, 
where the benefits of invasive manoeuvres and likelihood of discharge are 
weighed against an acceptable quality of life, aiming to prevent futile medical 
treatment.

Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between an 
artery and a vein that has an increased risk of bleeding. This case report 
presents a 53-year-old man diagnosed with a dural arteriovenous malformation 
fistula in occipital topography, lacking therapeutic indication because of an 
extension. He was admitted to an intensive care unit due to a high-risk 
pulmonary thromboembolism with indication for thrombolysis. Taking into account 
the hemorrhagic risk associated with arteriovenous malformation, the authors 
discuss the therapeutic options and the inherent risks.
LEARNING POINTS: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas are pathologic shunts 
between dural arteries and veins that have an inherent risk of intracranial 
hemorrhage.Systemic thrombolytic agents are a therapeutic option for high-risk 
pulmonary thromboembolism. Their potential benefits outweigh the risk of 
life-threatening bleeding; however, careful patient risk stratification should 
be performed and other options, such as surgical embolectomy or percutaneous 
catheter-directed treatment, should be considered if 
available.Multidisciplinarity is the key to better therapeutic decisions and the 
patient's opinion should always be taken into account.

BACKGROUND: Randomized placebo-controlled trials in the development of 
disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease are typically of short 
duration (12-18 months), and health economic modeling requires extrapolation of 
treatment effects beyond the trial period.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether observational data can be used to extrapolate 
data from open-label trials, we compared outcomes (cognition, function, 
behavior) over 36 months for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia in 
the GERAS observational study (proxy for placebo control) with those of the mild 
Alzheimer's disease population on active treatment (solanezumab) in two 18-month 
randomized placebo-controlled trials (EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2) and the 
additional 18-month open-label extension study (EXPEDITION-EXT).
DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of longitudinal data from patients with mild 
Alzheimer's disease dementia in the GERAS observational study (conducted in 
France, Germany and the United Kingdom) and the EXPEDITION program (conducted in 
Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia).
PARTICIPANTS: European and North American community-living patients, aged ≥55 
years, with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia and their caregivers. Mild 
Alzheimer's disease dementia was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination 
score of 20-26 in EXPEDITION and 21-26 in GERAS.
INTERVENTION: Active treatment in both randomized placebo-controlled trials and 
the open-label extension study was intravenous solanezumab 400 mg every 4 weeks. 
Patients in GERAS were receiving treatment as part of standard care.
MEASUREMENTS: Between-group differences for changes from baseline over 36 months 
in cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living, and 
behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia were assessed using models 
stratified by propensity score.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients and caregivers participating in GERAS were 
significantly older than those in the EXPEDITION studies, and the GERAS patient 
cohort had fewer years of education and a shorter time since diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease. The baseline mean Mini-Mental State Examination score of 
the GERAS cohort was significantly higher (indicating better cognition) than 
that of patients receiving placebo or active treatment in the pooled EXPEDITION 
studies Baseline functional ability scores were significantly lower for the 
GERAS cohort, indicating poorer functioning. Propensity score stratification 
achieved a good balance in the baseline variables between GERAS and the two 
EXPEDITION arms. Over 18 months, least squares mean changes from baseline in 
outcome measures were similar in the GERAS cohort and the pooled placebo groups 
from the randomized controlled trials. Also, the 18-month results for the 
comparison between the GERAS cohort and the pooled active treatment groups from 
the randomized controlled trials were generally similar to those reported for 
the comparison with the control group in the randomized trial. Comparison of 
active treatment (EXPEDITION-EXT) and observational study (GERAS, as proxy 
control) results over 36 months of the open-label trial showed a significantly 
smaller decline in activities of daily living (instrumental and basic) in the 
active treatment group, reflecting better functioning, but no between-group 
differences at 36 months for cognitive function or behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparing results from clinical trials and observational studies 
(real-world data) may be a useful methodological approach for informing 
long-term outcomes in Alzheimer's disease drug development and could be used to 
inform health economic modeling. Further research using this methodological 
approach is needed.

INTRODUCTION: Men's health research covers a broad range of topics. Men and 
women face different barriers to health, with men almost universally having a 
lower life expectancy than women. Access to high-quality information on men's 
health topics is potentially an important part of engaging men with medical 
services. We aim to assess the quality of men's health resources available on 
the internet across 4 developed countries using a tier-based rating system as 
well as the World Health Organisation Health on the Net (HON) standards.
METHODS: The Google search engine imbedded with the Health on the Net toolbar 
was used to assess 357 websites across Australia, Canada, America and United 
Kingdom using the search term 'men's health'. The websites were further 
subdivided into 3 tiers by 2 independent investigators, with tier 1 websites 
defined as government or health organisation sponsored, tier 2 websites defined 
as being sponsored by health services such as private clinics and insurance 
providers, and tier 3 websites being websites that did not meet criteria for the 
first 2 tiers.
RESULTS: Overall, 28% of websites were rated as tier 1, 26% as tier 2 and 46% as 
tier 3. The HONcode accreditation was overall 39% of tier 1 websites. The 
majority of websites reviewed were in the tier 3 category, and 35% of overall 
websites being non-health or non-medically related.
DISCUSSION: The lack of 'relevant' and HONcode-accredited websites relating to 
men's health should be appreciated by health care professionals.

Background: Sunitinib and Pazopanib are two metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(MRCC) treatment alternatives, however the health system in Chile does not 
consider coverage for any. The cost-effectiveness versus relevant comparator was 
assessed to support evidence-based decision making. Methods: A four health 
states Markov model was built: first, second line treatments, BSC and death. 
Benefits were measured in QALYs, and efficacy estimates were obtained from an 
indirect treatment comparison. A 10-year time horizon and a 3% undifferentiated 
discount rate were considered. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed. Results: The costs of treating MRCC with Sunitinib were 
higher than Pazopanib and BSC. When comparing Sunitinib versus Pazopanib, the 
incremental benefit is small favoring Sunitinib (0.03 QALYs). The base case 
scenario shows an average ICER of PA versus BSC of US$62,327.11/QALY and of 
US$85,885/QALY for Sunitinib versus Pazopanib. The ICER was most sensitive to 
the OS relative to BSC, where evidence was associated to important bias. 
Conclusions: Sunitinib or Pazopanib can be considered cost-effective if a 3 GDP 
per-capita threshold is assumed. The decision between SU or PA is highly 
sensitive to the price of the drugs, rather than the outcomes. Therefore, the 
decision might be made based on cost-minimization exercise.

BACKGROUND: As modern medicine extends the life expectancy of patients with 
life-limiting illnesses and health system resource pressures intensify, 
palliative care physicians increasingly need to transfer stable patients from 
specialist palliative care units to nursing homes. The experience of palliative 
care physicians in decision-making and communicating with patients and families 
about the need for this transition is underexplored in the literature.
AIM: This study aimed to explore the experiences of and communication techniques 
used by palliative care physicians as they consider and discuss nursing home 
placements for their patients.
DESIGN: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was used. 
Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 18 Australian 
palliative care physicians known for their interest or strength in communication 
skills across a range of palliative care settings.
RESULTS: Themes emerged from domains of physician experience (abandonment, 
systemic pressures, prognostic uncertainty, exacerbation of loss, and restoring 
resilience) and communication strategies (forecasting, checking in, provide 
context, and acknowledging grief).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the tension Australian palliative care 
physicians experience when transferring palliative care patients to nursing home 
and the complexity involved in decision-making. Physicians identified several 
communication strategies to engage patients and families to ease the transition.

ischemic stroke.

Hospital, London, UK.

BACKGROUND: Recently, two randomized controlled trials demonstrated the benefit 
of mechanical thrombectomy performed between 6 and 24 h in acute ischemic 
stroke. The current economic evidence is supporting the intervention only within 
6 h, but extended thrombectomy treatment times may result in better long-term 
outcomes for a larger cohort of patients.
AIMS: We compared the cost-utility of mechanical thrombectomy in addition to 
medical treatment versus medical treatment alone performed beyond 6 h from 
stroke onset in the UK National Health Service (NHS).
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of mechanical thrombectomy compared to medical 
treatment was performed using a Markov model that estimates expected costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 20-year time horizon. We present the 
results of three models using the data from the DEFUSE 3 and DAWN trials and 
evidence from published sources.
RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, the incremental cost per QALY of mechanical 
thrombectomy was $1564 (£1219) when performed after 12 h from onset, $5253 
(£4096) after 16 h and $3712 (£2894) after 24 h. The probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that thrombectomy had a 99.9% probability of being 
cost-effective at the minimum willingness to pay for a QALY commonly used in the 
UK.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that performing mechanical 
thrombectomy up to 24 h from acute ischemic stroke symptom onset is still 
cost-effective, suggesting that this intervention should be implemented by the 
NHS on the basis of improvement in quality of life as well as economic grounds.

INTRODUCTION: Periodic population surveys of smoking behavior can inform 
development of effective tobacco control strategies. We investigated smoking 
patterns, cessation, and knowledge about smoking hazards in China.
METHODS: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey recruited 176 318 
people aged ≥18 years across 31 provinces of China in 2013-2014, using 
multi-stage stratified cluster sampling methods. The smoking patterns, 
cessation, and knowledge about smoking hazards were analyzed, overall and in 
population subgroups, adjusting for sample selection weight and 
post-stratification factors.
RESULTS: Among men, 60.7% were ever-smokers, with proportions of regular, 
occasional and former smokers being 46.3%, 5.5%, and 8.8% respectively. Among 
women, only 2.8% had ever smoked. The prevalence of ever smoking in men was 
higher in rural than urban areas (63.2% vs. 57.6%) and varied from 39.5% to 
67.4% across 31 provinces. Among male regular smokers, the mean daily number of 
cigarettes smoked was 17.8, with mean age at first starting to smoke daily being 
20.1 years. Among current smokers, one-third (32.6% men, 32.1% women) had tried 
to quit before and 36.8% (36.8% men, 35.5% women) intended to quit in the 
future. Of the Chinese adults, 75.9% recognized that smoking was hazardous, with 
the proportions believing that smoking could cause lung cancer, heart attack or 
stroke being 67.0%, 33.2%, and 29.5%, respectively and with 26.0% reporting that 
smoking could cause all these conditions.
CONCLUSION: Among Chinese adults, the smoking prevalence remained high in men 
but was low in women. In both men and women, knowledge about smoking hazards was 
poor.
IMPLICATIONS: This study showed that tobacco smoking remained highly prevalent 
among adult men in China in 2013-2014. Moreover, men born in recent decades were 
more likely to start smoking at younger ages and to smoke more cigarettes than 
those born in previous generations. There was a large regional variation in male 
smoking prevalence, with the least economically developed regions having higher 
prevalence. In contrast, few women in China smoked, especially among those born 
in recent decades. The contrasting smoking patterns in men and women is likely 
to result in an increasingly large gender disparity in life expectancy in the 
coming decades.
