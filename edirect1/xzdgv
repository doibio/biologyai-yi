BACKGROUND: The clinical sign of patellar laxity and the associated symptom of 
apprehension are mainstays of the physical examination of patellofemoral 
instability. The apprehension test is widely used as a diagnostic tool and also 
as an outcome following patellofemoral stabilization surgery. Despite widespread 
use, the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the apprehension test have 
not been established.
PURPOSE: The primary purpose was to evaluate patellar apprehension in patients 
with recurrent patellofemoral instability to determine if the apprehension test 
is valid, reliable, and responsive to change after medial patellofemoral 
ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. The secondary purposes were to concurrently 
validate patient-rated to surgeon-rated apprehension and to correlate 
patient-rated apprehension with pathoanatomic characteristics and 
quality-of-life scores.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: A total of 89 patients underwent an MPFL reconstruction and were 
assessed preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The 
patellar apprehension test was performed in neutral extension and 30° of knee 
flexion. Patient- and surgeon-rated apprehension were graded on a 10-cm visual 
analog scale (VAS), and the quality of the apprehension symptoms were recorded. 
Risk factors for patellofemoral instability were documented, and the Banff 
Patellofemoral Instability Score 2.0 (BPII 2.0) was used to measure 
disease-specific quality of life.
RESULTS: The patient-rated and surgeon-rated apprehension VAS scores were 
statistically significantly reduced from pre- to postoperatively (P < .001, 
large effect size) for the neutral extension and 30° of flexion apprehension 
tests. Postoperatively, over 56% of patients reported a negative apprehension 
test. Up to 15.7% of patients with positive preoperative apprehension did not 
demonstrate a reduction postoperatively. Patients consistently graded their 
apprehension symptoms higher in both quantity and quality than the surgeon. The 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC [2, k]) assessing the preoperative 
patient and surgeon VAS scores revealed moderate interrater reliability in 
neutral extension (r = 0.60) and weak interrater reliability in 30° of flexion 
(r = 0.42). The postoperative ICC (2, k) demonstrated strong interrater 
reliability for both neutral extension (r = 0.74) and 30° of flexion (r = 0.73). 
The symptoms of apprehension (physical, emotional, and/or physiological) 
decreased substantially after surgery. The correlation of postoperative 
patient-rated apprehension VAS and BPII 2.0 scores demonstrated that less 
residual patellar apprehension was associated with higher BPII scores in neutral 
extension (r = -0.35, P = .001). There were no statistically significant 
correlations revealed between the patient-rated postoperative apprehension VAS 
and pathoanatomic risk factors. BPII 2.0 scores improved pre- to postoperatively 
from a mean of 27.6 (SD, 15.7) to 74.3 (SD, 18.3). Three patients (3.4%) 
sustained a patellar dislocation postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: The patellar apprehension test demonstrated strong validity and 
responsiveness to change. Interrater reliability ranged from weak to strong. 
There was a statistically significant reduction in apprehension after 
patellofemoral stabilization in the majority of patients. Patients graded their 
apprehension symptoms significantly higher in both quantity and quality than the 
surgeon. Persistent patellar apprehension after stabilization was correlated 
with lower quality-of-life scores. No relationship could be found between 
persistent apprehension and patellofemoral risk factors. These results suggest 
that use of the apprehension tests as an outcome is inappropriate until further 
validation is performed.

Objectives. To estimate total life expectancy (TLE), disability-free life 
expectancy (DFLE), and disabled life expectancy (DLE) by US state for women and 
men aged 25 to 89 years and examine the cross-state patterns.Methods. We used 
data from the 2013-2017 American Community Survey and the 2017 US Mortality 
Database to calculate state-specific TLE, DFLE, and DLE by gender for US adults 
and hypothetical worst- and best-case scenarios.Results. For men and women, 
DFLEs and DLEs varied widely by state. Among women, DFLE ranged from 45.8 years 
in West Virginia to 52.5 years in Hawaii, a 6.7-year gap. Men had a similar 
range. The gap in DLEs across states was 2.4 years for women and 1.6 years for 
men. The correlation among DFLE, DLE, and TLE was particularly strong in 
southern states. The South is doubly disadvantaged: residents have shorter lives 
and spend a greater proportion of those lives with disability.Conclusions. The 
stark variation in DFLE and DLE across states highlights the large health 
inequalities present today across the United States, which have significant 
implications for individuals' well-being and US states' financial costs and 
medical care burden.

Re-Thinking Co-Salient Object Detection.

Fan DP, Li T, Lin Z, Ji GP, Zhang D, Cheng MM, Fu H, Shen J.

In this article, we conduct a comprehensive study on the co-salient object 
detection (CoSOD) problem for images. CoSOD is an emerging and rapidly growing 
extension of salient object detection (SOD), which aims to detect the 
co-occurring salient objects in a group of images. However, existing CoSOD 
datasets often have a serious data bias, assuming that each group of images 
contains salient objects of similar visual appearances. This bias can lead to 
the ideal settings and effectiveness of models trained on existing datasets, 
being impaired in real-life situations, where similarities are usually semantic 
or conceptual. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a new benchmark, called 
CoSOD3k in the wild, which requires a large amount of semantic context, making 
it more challenging than existing CoSOD datasets. Our CoSOD3k consists of 3,316 
high-quality, elaborately selected images divided into 160 groups with 
hierarchical annotations. The images span a wide range of categories, shapes, 
object sizes, and backgrounds. Second, we integrate the existing SOD techniques 
to build a unified, trainable CoSOD framework, which is long overdue in this 
field. Specifically, we propose a novel CoEG-Net that augments our prior model 
EGNet with a co-attention projection strategy to enable fast common information 
learning. CoEG-Net fully leverages previous large-scale SOD datasets and 
significantly improves the model scalability and stability. Third, we 
comprehensively summarize 40 cutting-edge algorithms, benchmarking 18 of them 
over three challenging CoSOD datasets (iCoSeg, CoSal2015, and our CoSOD3k), and 
reporting more detailed (i.e., group-level) performance analysis. Finally, we 
discuss the challenges and future works of CoSOD. We hope that our study will 
give a strong boost to growth in the CoSOD community. The benchmark toolbox and 
results are available on our project page at https://dpfan.net/CoSOD3K.

[The risk of second radiation-induced cancer from hadrontherapy compared to 
traditional radiotherapy].

[Article in Italian; Abstract available in Italian from the publisher]

Radiation therapy increasingly plays a fundamental role in the treatment of 
cancer. Since the survival of cancer patients is continuously improving, the 
late effects of treatments, including those related to radiation treatment, can 
affect the quality of life and health and of the patients themselves to a 
greater extent. Especially in the last 20 years, with the implementation of new 
techniques/forms of radiation therapy, the risk of developing radiation-induced 
tumors following radiation therapy has become a hotly debated topic. Malignant 
tumors induced by radiation therapy represent a particularly important problem 
for pediatric patients, who are intrinsically more sensitive to carcinogens than 
adults and have a longer life expectancy. To date, there is only one study in 
the literature, from 2019, which analyzes the risk of secondary tumors after 
carbon ion radiation compared to surgery or photon treatment and refers to 
patients treated for prostate cancer. Despite the high degree of uncertainty, 
the data acquired so far suggest that particle radiation therapy, especially 
with protons delivered with active scanning, carries a lower risk of 
radiation-induced tumors than conventional photon therapies. This is largely due 
to the lower doses to which healthy tissues are exposed and the low relative 
risk associated with exposure to neutrons throughout the body, especially when 
active scanning beams are used.

Publisher: Il trattamento radioterapico svolge sempre più un ruolo fondamentale 
nel percorso terapeutico oncologico. Dal momento che la sopravvivenza dei 
pazienti affetti da tumore è in continuo miglioramento, gli effetti tardivi dei 
trattamenti, compresi quelli correlati al trattamento radiante, possono 
influenzare la qualità di vita e la salute dei pazienti stessi in modo maggiore. 
Soprattutto negli ultimi 20 anni, con l’implementazione di nuove tecniche/forme 
di radioterapia, il rischio di sviluppare tumori radio-indotti a seguito di un 
trattamento radioterapico è diventato un argomento molto dibattuto, soprattutto 
in ambito pediatrico. I pazienti pediatrici infatti sono intrinsecamente più 
sensibili ai carcinogeni rispetto agli adulti e hanno un’aspettativa di vita più 
lunga. Ad oggi, in letteratura è presente un solo studio, del 2019, che analizza 
il rischio di tumori secondari dopo radioterapia con ioni carbonio rispetto a 
chirurgia o trattamento con fotoni e si riferisce a pazienti trattati per tumore 
alla prostata. Malgrado l’alto grado di incertezza, i dati acquisiti fino ad ora 
suggeriscono che la radioterapia con particelle, in particolar modo con protoni 
erogati con scanning attivo, comporti un rischio minore di tumori radioindotti 
rispetto alle terapie convenzionali con fotoni. Ciò è dovuto in maggior parte 
alle minori dosi a cui vengono esposti i tessuti sani e al basso rischio 
relativo associato all’esposizione ai neutroni di tutto il corpo, soprattutto 
quando appunto si utilizzano fasci a scansione attiva..

Stroke Epidemiology in Oceania: A Review.

Venketasubramanian N(1).

drnvramani@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oceania, comprising the regions Australasia, Melanesia, 
Micronesia, and Polynesia, is home to 42 million living in 8.5 million square 
kilometres of land. This paper comprises a review of the epidemiology of stroke 
in countries in this region.
METHODS: Information on epidemiology of stroke in Oceania was sought from data 
from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study (incidence, mortality, 
incidence:mortality ratio [IMR], prevalence, disability-adjusted life-years 
[DALYs] lost due to stroke, and subtypes), World Health Organization (WHO) 
(vascular risk factors in the community), and PubMed (incidence, prevalence, and 
stroke subtypes). Data were analyzed by region to allow inter-country comparison 
within each region.
RESULTS: In 2010, age- and sex-standardized stroke mortality rates were lowest 
in Australasia (29.85-31.67/100,000) and highest in Melanesia and Micronesia 
(56.04-187.56/100,000), with wide ranges especially in Melanesia. Incidence 
rates were lowest in Australasia (101.36-105.54/100,000), similarly high 
elsewhere. Standardized IMR (0.98-3.39) was the inverse of the mortality rates 
and mirrored the prevalence rates (202.91-522.29/100,000). DALY rates 
(398.22-3,781.78/100,0000) mirrored the mortality rates. Stroke risk factors 
show a variable pattern - hypertension is generally the most common medical risk 
factor among males (18.0-26.6%), while among females, diabetes mellitus is the 
most common in Micronesia and Polynesia (21.5-28.4%). Among the lifestyle 
factors, current smoking is the most common in Melanesia among males, while 
obesity is generally the most common factor among females. Ischaemic stroke 
comprises 70% of stroke subtypes. Trend data show significant falls in 
standardized mortality rates and DALYs in most regions and falls in incidence in 
almost all countries. There is significant economic impact, particularly due to 
young strokes; some ethnicities are at higher risk than others, for example, 
Maoris and Pacific Islanders.
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke is a major healthcare problem in Oceania. Variations in 
stroke epidemiology are found between countries in Oceania. Data are lacking in 
some; more research into the burden of stroke in Oceania is needed. With the 
expected increase in life expectancy and vascular risk factors, the burden of 
stroke in Oceania will likely rise. Some of the disparities in stroke burden may 
be addressed by great investment in healthcare.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy in patients suffering from affective disorders is 
considerably diminished. We investigated whether skin autofluorescence (SAF), 
indicating concentration of advanced glycation end products in the skin and 
oxidative stress, mediates the association between affective disorders and 
excess mortality.
METHODS: Included were 81,041 participants of the Lifelines cohort study. 
Presence of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, 
panic disorder or social phobia was assessed with the Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview. SAF was assessed as mediator in Cox proportional 
hazards models for all-cause or natural-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mortality was increased in cases with major depression compared to 
controls (36.4 vs. 22.5 per 100,000 person years). Partial mediation by SAF of 
the association between affective disorders and mortality was shown (9.0-10.5%, 
P<.001-.002), although attenuated by cardiometabolic parameters and history of 
physical illness. For major depressive disorder, partial mediation by 5.5-10.3% 
was shown (crude model: P<.001; fully adjusted model: P=.03).
LIMITATIONS: The relatively short duration of follow-up and the relatively young 
cohort resulted in a lack of power to detect an association between mortality 
and dysthymia, social phobia and two or more comorbid disorders.
CONCLUSION: Evidence of partial mediation by SAF of the association between 
affective disorders and all-cause and natural-cause mortality was demonstrated, 
although attenuated by health factors. For major depression, mediation by SAF 
was largest and remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographic and 
health factors, identifying oxidative stress as possible determinant of 
premature death.

PURPOSE: The increasing age of donors and the increasing tendency of 
comorbidities requires an extension in acceptance criteria. In this review, the 
tendency for acceptance and refusal was analyzed by examining reasons for 
declining donor kidneys at the kidney transplantation center in Debrecen. This 
analysis aimed to assess the quality of donor kidneys and indicate why 
two-thirds of donated organs were refused.
METHOD: Our center in Debrecen received 535 kidney offers (based on exclusion 
criteria) between November 2016 and August 2019, which were retrospectively 
analyzed. Donor kidneys were evaluated using expanded criteria donor, kidney 
donor profile index (KDPI), and kidney donor risk index criteria systems.
RESULTS: Thirty-five percent (n = 189) of the kidneys offered to the center in 
Debrecen had been approved in advance, and later 63% (n = 119) were 
transplanted. Using the KDPI system, 41% of donors had a KDPI above 85, of which 
23% were accepted, while acceptance of kidneys with a KDPI of 0 to 35 was around 
70%. When examining causes of donor kidney refusal, 90% of the organs had donor 
quality problems, 13% had logistical cause (long cold ischemic time, large age 
difference between donor and recipient), and 10.5% had immunologic cause. In 13% 
of cases, the refusal of donor organs was due to the coexistence of several 
problems.
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that high-risk donor organs were being refused in 
our center; however, they are being transplanted at a higher rate in other 
Eurotransplant centers. The decision to refuse or accept donor organs depends on 
several factors, including expected waiting time, patient's clinical 
characteristics, and quality of life.

Understanding the mortality impact of COVID-19 requires not only counting the 
dead, but analyzing how premature the deaths are. We calculate years of life 
lost (YLL) across 81 countries due to COVID-19 attributable deaths, and also 
conduct an analysis based on estimated excess deaths. We find that over 20.5 
million years of life have been lost to COVID-19 globally. As of January 6, 
2021, YLL in heavily affected countries are 2-9 times the average seasonal 
influenza; three quarters of the YLL result from deaths in ages below 75 and 
almost a third from deaths below 55; and men have lost 45% more life years than 
women. The results confirm the large mortality impact of COVID-19 among the 
elderly. They also call for heightened awareness in devising policies that 
protect vulnerable demographics losing the largest number of life-years.

Botryllids are colonial ascidians widely studied for their potential 
invasiveness and as model organisms, however the morphological description and 
discrimination of these species is very problematic, leading to frequent 
specimen misidentifications. To facilitate species discrimination and detection 
of cryptic/new species, we developed new barcoding primers for the amplification 
of a COI fragment of about 860 bp (860-COI), which is an extension of the common 
Folmer's barcode region. Our 860-COI was successfully amplified in 177 
worldwide-sampled botryllid colonies. Combined with morphological analyses, 
860-COI allowed not only discriminating known species, but also identifying 
undescribed and cryptic species, resurrecting old species currently in synonymy, 
and proposing the assignment of clade D of the model organism Botryllus 
schlosseri to Botryllus renierii. Importantly, within clade A of B. schlosseri, 
860-COI recognized at least two candidate species against only one recognized by 
the Folmer's fragment, underlining the need of further genetic investigations on 
this clade. This result also suggests that the 860-COI could have a greater 
ability to diagnose cryptic/new species than the Folmer's fragment at very short 
evolutionary distances, such as those observed within clade A. Finally, our new 
primers simplify the amplification of 860-COI even in non-botryllid ascidians, 
suggesting their wider usefulness in ascidians.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the most commonly used dialysis methods and 
plays an important role in maintaining the quality of life of patients with 
end-stage renal disease. However, long-term PD treatment is associated with 
adverse effects on the structure and function of peritoneal tissue, which may 
lead to peritoneal ultrafiltration failure, resulting in dialysis failure and 
eventually PD withdrawal. In order to prevent the occurrence of these effects, 
the important issues that need to be tackled are improvement of ultrafiltration, 
protection of peritoneal function and extension of dialysis time. In basic PD 
research, a reasonable experimental model is key to the smooth progress of 
experiments. A good PD model should not only simulate the process of human PD as 
accurately as possible, but also help researchers to understand the evolution 
process and pathogenesis of various complications related to PD treatment. To 
better promote the clinical application of PD technology, the present review 
will summarize and evaluate the in vivo PD experimental models available, thus 
providing a reference for relevant PD research.

As life expectancy increases, a rise in the number of chronically ill patients 
is observed due to the aging population. Among the various diseases, chronic 
kidney disease is at present one of the main causes of morbidity and, due to its 
typical complications, it is also one of the most important causes of mortality 
in the general population. For these reasons, the understanding of the kidney 
aging process, its consequences and its adequate management are essential. The 
judicious use of certain types of drugs, the prevention of episodes of renal 
injury either by toxic mechanisms or by dehydration are important aspects and 
are part of the apropriate approach for elderly patients. The most effective 
treatment of various types of conditions with a negative impact on renal 
function and for which an increased incidence is known as we age should also be 
considered. Thus, in the case of elderly patients, in order to protect the 
kidneys, an integrative approach is recommended, one that includes both elements 
of prevention and the appropriate treatment of existing diseases.

Breast cancer remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality by cancer 
in females worldwide, even though it is largely preventable through population 
screening. Despite notable progress in the last years in the EU, breast cancer 
screening programs still maintain wide variations among countries and 
socio-economic groups. This statistical review aimed to investigate the breast 
cancer-related health gaps in Romanian women compared to the average EU female 
population after 10 years of accession (2007-2016). We evaluated breast 
cancer-related deaths, age-standardized mortality rates and contribution of 
breast cancer to life expectancy. Trends and percentage changes were compared 
between Romania and EU-27 for breast cancer, all cancer and all causes of 
mortality. We found a higher increase of breast cancer deaths in Romania, an 
increasing trend of mortality (opposite to EU) and a contribution to life 
expectancy at birth that increased gradually from 0.45 to 0 48 years. All these 
health gaps compared to EU are aggravated by the fact that no population 
screening for breast cancer is organized in the country. The opportunities for 
organizing such a program are consistent, but they should be increased in the 
future, in order to control the health gap between Romania and EU.

The WHO Classification of Endocrine Tumours designates pituitary neoplasms as 
adenomas. A proposed nomenclature change to pituitary neuroendocrine tumors 
(PitNETs) has been met with concern by some stakeholder groups. The Pituitary 
Society coordinated the Pituitary Neoplasm Nomenclature (PANOMEN) workshop to 
address the topic. Experts in pituitary developmental biology, pathology, 
neurosurgery, endocrinology, and oncology, including representatives nominated 
by the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, European 
Neuroendocrine Association, Growth Hormone Research Society, and International 
Society of Pituitary Surgeons. Clinical epidemiology, disease phenotype, 
management, and prognosis of pituitary adenomas differ from that of most NETs. 
The vast majority of pituitary adenomas are benign and do not adversely impact 
life expectancy. A nomenclature change to PitNET does not address the main 
challenge of prognostic prediction, assigns an uncertain malignancy designation 
to benign pituitary adenomas, and may adversely affect patients. Due to pandemic 
restrictions, the workshop was conducted virtually, with audiovisual lectures 
and written précis on each topic provided to all participants. Feedback was 
collated and summarized by Content Chairs and discussed during a virtual writing 
meeting moderated by Session Chairs, which yielded an evidence-based draft 
document sent to all participants for review and approval. There is not yet a 
case for adopting the PitNET nomenclature. The PANOMEN Workshop recommends that 
the term adenoma be retained and that the topic be revisited as new evidence on 
pituitary neoplasm biology emerges.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered a chronic autoimmune 
inflammatory disease that causes great morbidity and shortens life expectancy; 
however, the precise pathogenesis of RA remains unclear. This study aimed to 
select hub genes correlated with the development of RA.
METHODS: Two gene expression profiles, GSE55235 and GSE12021, obtained from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to identify differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) in control and RA samples using GEO2R, followed by other 
bioinformatics methods, including functional enrichment analysis, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, miRNA-hub gene network, and drug-hub 
gene interactions. In addition, qRT-PCR was finally conducted to confirm the 
reliability and validity of the expression level of the novel DEGs via freshly 
collected heparinized blood samples of healthy controls and RA patients.
RESULTS: A sum of 136 upregulated and 37 downregulated DEGs were selected. 
Functional enrichment analysis indicated that all the upregulated DEGs were 
correlated with immune response, B cell receptor signalling pathway, and 
adaptive immune response. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the 
upregulated DEGs were mostly related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, 
primary immunodeficiency, chemokine signalling pathways, and cell adhesion 
molecules (CAMs). In total, 12 hub genes (IL15, KLRK1, GZMA, CXCR6, IGHV4-38-2, 
IGLL5, CXCL13, CXCL11, MS4A1, SDC1, SLAMF1, and PDCD1LG2) were identified and 
all these hub genes were upregulated, of which IGLL5 and IGHV4-38-2 were first 
reported to be correlated with the pathogenic mechanism and prognosis of RA. 
Furthermore, we also used qRT-PCR to validate the overexpression of IGLL5 and 
IGHV4-38-2 in RA patients compared to the healthy controls. In the miRNA-hub 
gene network, hsa-miR-1185-5p and hsa-miR-3679-5p might inhibit the expression 
of IGLL5 during the progression of RA. The 15 most promising candidate drugs, 
which were all approved by the Food and Drug Administration, may assist with the 
treatment of RA.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings may assist with developing diagnostic, 
prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for RA. Key Points • IGLL5 and IGHV4-38-2 
were first reported to be correlated with the pathogenic mechanism and prognosis 
of RA. • Besides, hsa-miR-1185-5p and hsa-miR-3679-5p may inhibit the expression 
of IGLL5 during the progression of RA.

Cost-effectiveness analyses of health care programs often focus on maximizing 
health and ignore nonhealth impacts. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of public 
health interventions from a narrow health care perspective would likely 
underestimate their full impact, and potentially lead to inefficient decisions 
about funding. The aim of this study is to provide a practical application of a 
recently proposed framework for the economic evaluation of public health 
interventions, evaluating an intervention to reduce alcohol misuse in criminal 
offenders. This cross-sectoral analysis distinguishes benefits and opportunity 
costs for different sectors, makes explicit the value judgments required to 
consider alternative perspectives, and can inform heterogeneous decision makers 
with different objectives in a transparent manner. Three interventions of 
increasing intensity are compared: client information leaflet, brief advice, and 
brief lifestyle counseling. Health outcomes are measured in quality-adjusted 
life-years and criminal justice outcomes in reconvictions. Costs considered 
include intervention costs, costs to the NHS and costs to the criminal justice 
system. The results are presented for four different perspectives: "narrow" 
health care perspective; criminal justice system perspective; "full" health care 
perspective; and joint "full" health and criminal justice perspective. 
Conclusions and recommendations differ according to the normative judgment on 
the appropriate perspective for the evaluation.

The Fontan procedure is a well-established surgical technique to improve 
survival in patients with univentricular heart disease. The procedure reroutes 
the systemic venous flow to the lungs, bypassing the right ventricle. The 
originally proposed method involved direct anastomosis of the right atrium to 
the pulmonary artery. Since then, several modifications have been made in the 
original technique leading to the modern Fontan, or total cavopulmonary 
connection. The modern Fontan technique has shown improved surgical outcomes and 
increased life expectancy in patients with univentricular disease. Due to the 
increased survival of these patients, long-term complications are becoming more 
prevalent. Common complications of Fontan procedure include right atrial 
dilatation and thrombosis; conduit stenosis and thrombosis; right-to-left and 
left-to-right shunts; hepatic congestion and cirrhosis; and lymphovascular. 
Computed tomography (CT) can reliably depict the normal Fontan anatomy and 
various postoperative complications. A fundamental understanding of the 
techniques of CT, including imaging protocols and common interpretive pitfalls, 
allows targeted imaging and precise reporting of clinically significant 
findings. Radiologists should be familiar with the multiple stages of 
single-ventricle palliation, normal Fontan anatomy, pathophysiology, and imaging 
features of common Fontan-related complications.

BACKGROUND: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the foremost single cause of 
mortality and loss of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) globally. A large 
percentage of this burden is found in low and middle income countries. This 
accounts for nearly 7 million deaths and 129 million DALYs annually and is a 
huge global economic burden.
OBJECTIVE: To review epidemiological data of coronary artery disease and acute 
coronary syndrome in low, middle and high income countries.
METHODS: Keyword searches of Medline, ISI, IBSS and Google Scholar databases. 
Manual search of other relevant journals and reference lists of primary 
articles.
RESULTS: Review of the results of studies reveals the absolute global and 
regional trends of the CAD and the importance and contribution of CAD for global 
health. Data demonstrates which region or countries have the highest and lowest 
age-standardized DALY rates and what factors might explain these patterns. 
Results also show differences among the determinants of CAD, government 
policies, clinical practice and public health measures across the various 
regions of world.
CONCLUSION: CAD mortality and prevalence vary among countries. Estimation of the 
true prevalence of CAD in the population is complex. A significant number of 
countries have not provided data, the estimation of the exact figures for 
epidemiological data is a barrier. The incidence of CAD continues to fall in 
developed countries over the last few decades and this may be due to both 
effective treatment of the acute phase and improved primary and secondary 
preventive measures. Developing countries show considerable variability in the 
incidence of CAD. The globalization of the Western diet and increased sedentary 
lifestyle will have a dramatic influence on the progressive increase in the 
incidence of CAD in these countries.

[Rehabilitation methods for cancer patients with peripheral polyneuropathy 
induced by cytostatics].

An analytical review of the methods of cancer patients' rehabilitation with 
peripheral polyneuropathy induced by cytostatics (PNPIC) was carried out. 
Studies from electronic databases were investigated: Scopus, Web of Science, 
MedLine, World Health Organization, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, ScienceDirect, US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of 
Health, PubMed Cancer, eLIBRARY, CyberLeninka. Despite the improvement of 
anticancer therapy and an increase in patients' life expectancy, the emerging 
peripheral polyneuropathy remains an urgent problem, since it significantly 
affects both the patients' life quality and the selection of adequate therapy. 
The frequency of detection of PNPIC is 90%, after discontinuation of treatment; 
symptoms of damaged peripheral nerve fibers remain in 30% of patients. The 
clinical symptoms of PNPIC are varied and most often include numbness in the 
extremities and / or increased sensitivity to thermal or mechanical stimuli, 
neuropathic pain. Currently, to prevent PNPIC, treatment is being modified with 
a reduction in the duration of courses and doses of cytostatics, and 
interruption of treatment. Official guidelines do not recommend any prophylaxis 
other than the possible use of duloxetine or a topical gel containing baclofen, 
amitriptyline, and ketamine. Over the past few years, there has been no 
significant progress in the prevention and treatment of PNPIC. The most common 
drug treatment method in clinical practice is the prescription of vitamins B. 
Among the non-drug treatment methods of PNPIC, the authors used acupuncture, 
electro-acupuncture, manual therapy, massage, gymnastics, yoga, sensorimotor 
training, general vibration therapy, percutaneous electro-neuro-stimulation, 
electro-analgesia, local cryotherapy, hydrotherapy, low-intensity alternating 
magnetic radiation. The studies included in the review are heterogeneous in 
design and protocol, number of patients, and time points for assessing outcomes. 
In connection with the existing differences, it is not possible to carry out a 
comparative analysis of the results of these rehabilitation types and to give an 
unambiguous answer about their effectiveness. As the analysis has shown, 
peripheral PNPIC is well known all over the world, however, the search for 
methods of its treatment is far from complete.

Изучены исследования из электронных баз данных: Scopus, Web of Science, MedLine, 
World Health Organization, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
ScienceDirect, US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health,

противоопухолевой терапии и увеличение продолжительности жизни больных, 
возникающая периферическая полинейропатия остается актуальной проблемой, 
поскольку существенно влияет как на качество жизни больных, так и на подбор 
адекватной терапии. Частота выявления ПНПИЦ составляет 90%, после отмены лечения 
симптомы повреждения периферических нервных волокон остаются у 30% больных.
