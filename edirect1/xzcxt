OBJECTIVE: The role of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) continues to be debated in 
the age of optimal medical therapy, particularly for patients with limited life 
expectancy. The Risk Analysis Index (RAI) measures frailty, a syndrome of 
decreased physiologic reserve, which increases vulnerability to adverse 
outcomes. The RAI better predicts surgical complications, nonhome discharge, and 
death than age or comorbidities alone. We sought to measure the association of 
frailty, as measured by the RAI, with postoperative in-hospital stroke, 
long-term stroke, and long-term survival after CEA. We also sought to determine 
how postoperative stroke interacts with frailty to alter survival trajectory 
after CEA.
METHODS: We queried the Vascular Quality Initiative CEA procedure and long-term 
data sets (2003-2017) for elective CEAs with complete RAI case information. For 
all analyses, the cohort was divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid 
stenosis. Scoring was defined as not frail (RAI <30), frail (RAI 30-34), and 
very frail (RAI ≥35). Mortality information through December 2017 was obtained 
from the Social Security Death Index. Multivariable models (logistic and Cox 
proportional hazards regressions) were used to study the association of frail 
and very frail patients with the outcomes of interest. In a post hoc analysis, 
we created Kaplan-Meier curves to analyze patient mortality after CEA as well as 
after postoperative stroke.
RESULTS: Of the 42,869 included patients, 17,092 (39.9%) were female, and 38,395 
(89.6%) were white. There were 25,673 (59.9%) patients assigned to the 
asymptomatic stenosis group and 17,196 (40.1%) patients in the symptomatic 
stenosis group. Frailty was not associated with perioperative or long-term 
postoperative stroke. The risk of long-term mortality was significantly higher 
for frail (hazard ratio, 1.9 [1.7-2.3]) and very frail (hazard ratio, 3.1 
[2.6-3.7]) asymptomatic patients; symptomatic frail and very frail patients also 
had a two to three times increased risk of long-term mortality. Frail and very 
frail patients had two to three times the risk for long-term mortality compared 
with patients who were not frail. Postoperative stroke negatively affected the 
mortality trajectory for all patients in the cohort, regardless of frailty 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: RAI score is not associated with postoperative stroke; however, 
frail and very frail status is associated with decreased long-term survival in 
an incremental fashion based on increasing RAI. RAI assessment should be 
considered in the preoperative decision-making for patients undergoing CEA to 
ensure long-term survival and optimal surgical outcomes vs medical management.

Musculoskeletal diseases and disorders, including osteoporosis and rheumatoid 
arthritis are diseases that threaten a healthy life expectancy, and in order to 
extend the healthy life expectancy of elderly people, it is important to prevent 
bone and joint diseases and disorders. We previously reported that alymphoplasia 
(aly/aly) mice, which have a loss-of-function mutation in the Nik gene involved 
in the processing of p100 to p52 in the alternative NF-κB pathway, show mild 
osteopetrosis with a decrease in the osteoclast number, suggesting that the 
alternative NF-κB pathway is a potential drug target for ameliorating bone 
diseases. Recently, the novel NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK)-specific inhibitor 
compound 33 (Cpd33) was developed, and we examined its effect on osteoclastic 
bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. Cpd33 inhibited the receptor activator of 
NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis accompanied by a decrease in the 
expression of nfatc1, dc-stamp, and cathepsin K, markers of osteoclast 
differentiation, without affecting the cell viability, in a dose-dependent 
manner. Cdp33 specifically suppressed the RANKL-induced processing of p100 to 
p52 but not the phosphorylation of p65 or the degradation or resynthesis of IκBα 
in osteoclast precursors. Cpd33 also suppressed the bone-resorbing activity in 
mature osteoclasts. Furthermore, Cdp33 treatment prevented bone loss by 
suppressing the osteoclast formation without affecting the osteoblastic bone 
formation in ovariectomized mice. Taken together, NIK inhibitors may be a new 
option for patients with a reduced response to conventional pharmacotherapy or 
who have serious side effects.

BACKGROUND: As global rates of mortality decrease, rates of non-fatal injury 
have increased, particularly in low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) nations. We 
hypothesised this global pattern of non-fatal injury would be demonstrated in 
regard to bony hand and wrist trauma over the 27-year study period.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 
was used to estimate prevalence, age-standardised incidence and years lived with 
disability for hand trauma in 195 countries from 1990 to 2017. Individual 
injuries included hand and wrist fractures, thumb amputations and non-thumb 
digit amputations.
RESULTS: The global incidence of hand trauma has only modestly decreased since 
1990. In 2017, the age-standardised incidence of hand and wrist fractures was 
179 per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 146 to 217), whereas the less 
common injuries of thumb and non-thumb digit amputation were 24 (95% UI 17 to 
34) and 56 (95% UI 43 to 74) per 100 000, respectively. Rates of injury vary 
greatly by region, and improvements have not been equally distributed. The 
highest burden of hand trauma is currently reported in high SDI countries. 
However, low-middle and middle SDI countries have increasing rates of hand 
trauma by as much at 25%.
CONCLUSIONS: Certain regions are noted to have high rates of hand trauma over 
the study period. Low-middle and middle SDI countries, however, have 
demonstrated increasing rates of fracture and amputation over the last 27 years. 
This trend is concerning as access to quality and subspecialised surgical hand 
care is often limiting in these resource-limited regions.

Obesity is a highly heritable multifactorial disease that places an enormous 
burden on human health. Its increasing prevalence and the concomitant-reduced 
life expectancy has intensified the search for new analytical methods that can 
reduce the knowledge gap between genetic susceptibility and functional 
consequences of the disease pathology. Although the influence of genetics and 
epigenetics has been studied independently in the past, there is increasing 
evidence that genetic variants interact with environmental factors through 
epigenetic regulation. This suggests that a combined analysis of genetic and 
epigenetic variation may be more effective in characterizing the obesity 
phenotype. To date, limited genome-wide integrative analyses have been 
performed. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest findings, 
advantages, and challenges and discuss future perspectives.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of 
nanoemulsification for improving the efficiency of chitosan- Ferulago angulata 
essential oil coating (CH + EO) on extending the shelf life of Rainbow trout 
fillets during 16 days storage at 4 °C. The average droplet size of coarse 
emulsions was dramatically reduced after nanoemulsification which was 
accompanied by a significantly more positive ζ-potential and lower 
polydispersity index. In vitro antibacterial potential of CH + EO against two 
fish specific spoilage organisms, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas 
fluorescens, and its antioxidant activity improved significantly (p < 0.05) when 
nanoemulsions were fabricated. The CH + EO nanoemulsion (3% EO) treatment 
exhibited a significantly better inhibitory effect on bacterial growth of 
refrigeration stored Rainbow trout fillets. Moreover, nanoemulsification 
potentiated the efficacy of CH + EO in retarding the increase of TVB-N and lipid 
peroxidation in fish fillets. Texture, colour, and overall acceptability of 
CH + EO nanoemulsion treated samples were significantly (p < 0.05) better than 
those of other samples. Results suggest nanoemulsification as a potential 
approach to enhance the efficacy of the active coating.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost of a screening program for identifying latent 
tuberculosis (TB) infections in migrants to Oman.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost of screening using an 
interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) applied to all migrants from high TB 
endemic countries, followed by preventive TB treatment.
RESULTS: The model compared seven different scenarios, with a comparison of the 
direct cost and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved.
CONCLUSIONS: IGRA testing followed by 3 months of preventive treatment with 
rifapentine/isoniazid (3HP) was the most cost-effective intervention.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As novel therapies are expanding the life expectancy of 
patients with multiple myeloma, appropriate supportive care has become critical 
in the management of these patients. This review aims to outline the key 
principles of supportive care of patients with myeloma, including management of 
bone disease, renal disease, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, infections, and 
venous thromboembolism.
RECENT FINDINGS: The results from large randomized, controlled trials on the use 
of high-cutoff hemodialysis in the removal of free light chains in renal disease 
and the use of levofloxacin in the prevention of infections have recently been 
published. These results, along with updated guidelines from professional 
societies on the use of bisphosphonates and erythropoietin stimulating agents, 
have provided guidance on more effective management strategies for myeloma 
patients. Integration of these updated guidelines and supportive care strategies 
into clinical practice will help to ensure quality of life for patients with 
myeloma.

Healthcare expenditure and carbon footprint in the USA: evidence from hidden 
cointegration approach.

The priority aim of this study is to investigate the effect of carbon footprint, 
which is an indicator of environmental degradation, on health expenditures for 
the USA. In the study, cointegration analysis was performed for the period 
1970-2016 by using health expenditures, carbon footprint, gross domestic product 
per capita and life expectancy at birth variables. According to the results of 
standard cointegration analysis, only cointegration relationship between health 
expenditures and income was found. In the models with carbon footprint, no 
cointegration relationship was discovered between the original values of the 
variables. This result was approached with suspicion, and it was thought that 
there might be a hidden cointegration between healthcare expenditures and carbon 
footprint. For this purpose, the hidden cointegration analysis and crouching 
error correction model proposed by Granger and Yoon [18] were employed among the 
positive and negative components of the variables of healthcare expenditures and 
carbon footprint. The results of the hidden cointegration analysis revealed that 
there was a hidden cointegration relationship between the positive components of 
healthcare expenditures and the positive components of carbon footprint. 
Analysis results show that a 1% increase in carbon footprint will cause a 2.04% 
increase in healthcare expenditures in the long term in the USA. When the 
positive components of the variables were considered, it was concluded that 
there was a one-way long-term asymmetric causality relationship between carbon 
footprint and healthcare expenditures. As a result of the study, it was proposed 
that the carbon footprint should be diminished to prevent the increasing burden 
of the healthcare expenditures on the budget.

OBJECTIVE: We calculated life expectancy and inequalities therein by income for 
the period of 2016-2018 across the 253 electoral constituencies of the 20th 
National Assembly election in Korea.
METHODS: We obtained population and death data between 2016 and 2018 from the 
National Health Information Database and constructed abridged life tables using 
standard life table procedures according to sex and income quintiles for the 
electoral constituencies of the 20th National Assembly election held in 2016.
RESULTS: Life expectancy across the 253 constituencies ranged from 80.51 to 
87.05 years, corresponding to a gap of 6.54 years. The life expectancy 
difference by income across the 253 constituencies ranged from 2.94 years to 
10.67 years. In each province, the difference in life expectancy by income 
across electoral constituencies was generally greater than the 
inter-constituency differences. Constituencies in capital and metropolitan areas 
showed a higher life expectancy and a lower life expectancy difference by income 
than constituencies in rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Pro-rich inequalities in life expectancy by income existed in every 
electoral constituency in Korea. Both intra-constituency and inter-constituency 
socioeconomic inequalities in health should be highlighted in future 
policy-making in the National Assembly.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were added to lysozyme (Lys) loaded β-chitosan 
(β-CS) nanoparticles (NPs) based on ionic gelation technique for enhancing their 
antibacterial stability. Particle size of CNCs stabilized Lys loaded low (L) and 
high (H) molecular weight (MW) β-CS NPs reached 140.93 and 284.03 nm with 
encapsulation efficacy (EE) of 59.38 and 51.23 %, respectively. CNCs stabilized 
Lys loaded LMW β-CS NPs with smaller particle size showed higher antibacterial 
activity against E. coli and L. innocua than that of LMW β-CS NPs and Lys loaded 
LMW β-CS NPs. Inhibition zones (IZ) of CNCs stabilized Lys loaded LMW β-CS NPs 
against E. coli and L. innocua were 13.29 and 15.29 mm, respectively. in vitro 
release study conducted at pH 4.5 and 7.4 showed that CNCs stabilized Lys loaded 
β-CS NPs sustained the release of Lys over 12 h. CNCs, as stabilizers and 
fillers, enhanced and extended antibacterial property of Lys loaded β-CS NPs 
through electrostatic interaction and colloidal stability. It was demonstrated 
that CNCs stabilized Lys loaded β-CS NPs could be used as packaging material for 
shelf life extension.

In Australia, individuals of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent 
(Indigenous Australians) have poorer health outcomes than the general 
population, including higher incidence of cancer and reduced life expectancy up 
to 14 years compared to non-Indigenous Australians. Although differences in 
engagement with healthcare and beliefs about disease/cancer exist between 
Indigenous communities, a number of common barriers have been identified 
hindering attendance at mainstream health services. To inform exploration of 
barriers that may impact access to a cancer genetic counseling service, 
consultations with Aboriginal stakeholders were undertaken. Ethical principles 
for studies that engage Indigenous communities were followed throughout the 
research endeavor. Using a stakeholder-endorsed focus group approach, the views 
of an Aboriginal Elders group (n = 9) were sought with additional 
semi-structured interviews with social science and genetics researchers working 
with Indigenous communities in Australia (n = 7). Thematic analysis of the 
results identified three themes: explanatory models of illness, barriers to 
keeping well and attending services, and recommendations for improvements to 
access/attendance. Barriers common to accessing both mainstream health services 
and clinical genetic services were identified, including attributions of illness 
and cancer. Specific genetic counseling barriers included the cultural 
inclusivity and accessibility of services, and a lack of awareness of genetic 
counseling both in the community and by clinicians unfamiliar with genetics. 
Recommendations included developing flexible service delivery models and 
culturally appropriate resources for Indigenous patients. These findings may 
inform future studies to improve Indigenous health outcomes and promote a more 
accessible, culturally appropriate approach to provision of cancer genetics 
services for Australia's First Peoples.

BACKGROUND: The children of parents with severe personality difficulties have 
greater risk of significant mental health problems. Existing care is poorly 
co-ordinated, with limited effectiveness. A specialised parenting intervention 
may improve child and parenting outcomes, reduce family morbidity and lower the 
service costs.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a specialised parenting intervention for parents affected 
by severe personality difficulties who have children with mental health problems 
and to conduct a feasibility trial.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, mixed-methods design to develop and pilot a specialised 
parenting intervention, Helping Families Programme-Modified, and to conduct a 
randomised feasibility trial with process evaluation. Initial cost-effectiveness 
was assessed using UK NHS/Personal Social Services and societal perspectives, 
generating quality-adjusted life-years. Researchers collecting quantitative data 
were masked to participant allocation.
SETTING: Two NHS mental health trusts and concomitant children's social care 
services.
PARTICIPANTS: Parents who met the following criteria: (1) the primary caregiver 
of the index child, (2) aged 18-65 years, (3) have severe personality 
difficulties, (4) proficient in English and (5) capable of providing informed 
consent. Index children who met the following criteria: (1) aged 3-11 years, (2) 
living with index parent and (3) have significant emotional/behavioural 
difficulties. Exclusion criteria were (1) having coexisting psychosis, (2) 
participating in another parenting intervention, (3) receiving inpatient care, 
(4) having insufficient language/cognitive abilities, (5) having child 
developmental disorder, (6) care proceedings and (7) index child not residing 
with index parent.
INTERVENTION: The Helping Families Programme-Modified - a 16-session 
intervention using structured, goal-orientated strategies and collaborative 
therapeutic methods to improve parenting, and child and parent functioning. 
Usual care - standard care augmented by a single psychoeducational session.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trial feasibility - rates of recruitment, eligibility, 
allocation, retention, data completion and experience. Intervention 
acceptability - rates of acceptance, completion, alliance (Working Alliance 
Inventory-Short Revised) and experience. Outcomes - child (assessed via Concerns 
About My Child, Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory, Child Behaviour 
Checklist-Internalising Scale), parenting (assessed via the Arnold-O'Leary 
Parenting Scale, Kansas Parental Satisfaction Scale), parent (assessed via the 
Symptom Checklist-27), and health economics (assessed via the Client Service 
Receipt Inventory, EuroQol-5 Dimensions).
RESULTS: The findings broadly supported trial feasibility using non-diagnostic 
screening criteria. Parents were mainly referred from one site (75.0%). Site and 
participant factors delayed recruitment. An estimate of eligible parents was not 
obtained. Of the 86 parents referred, 60 (69.7%) completed screening and 48 of 
these (80.0%) were recruited. Participants experienced significant disadvantage 
and multiple morbidity. The Helping Families Programme-Modified uptake (87.5%) 
was higher than usual-care uptake (62.5%). Trial retention (66.7%, 95% 
confidence interval 51.6% to 79.6%) exceeded the a priori rate. Process findings 
highlighted the impact of random allocation and the negative effects on 
retention. The Helping Families Programme-Modified was acceptable, with duration 
of delivery longer than planned, whereas the usual-care condition was less 
acceptable. At initial follow-up, effects on child and parenting outcomes were 
detected across both arms, with a potential outcome advantage for the Helping 
Families Programme-Modified (effect size range 0.0-1.3). For parental 
quality-adjusted life-years, the Helping Families Programme-Modified dominated 
usual care, and child quality-adjusted life-years resulted in higher costs and 
more quality-adjusted life-years. At second follow-up, the Helping Families 
Programme-Modified was associated with higher costs and more quality-adjusted 
life-years than usual care. For child quality-adjusted life-years, when 
controlled for baseline EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version, usual care 
dominated the Helping Families Programme-Modified. No serious adverse events 
were reported.
CONCLUSION: The Helping Families Programme-Modified is an acceptable specialised 
parenting intervention. Trial methods using non-diagnostic criteria were largely 
supported. For future work, a definitive efficacy trial should consider site 
selection, recruitment methods, intervention efficiency and revised comparator 
condition.

Plain Language Summary: Parents affected by personality difficulties experience 
strong, overwhelming emotions and struggle in their personal and social 
relationships. These difficulties can interfere with their ability to provide 
stable, safe and warm parenting, which increases the risk of their children 
developing mental health problems. This research developed the Helping Families 
Programme-Modified, a new parenting intervention designed to help parents with 
severe personality difficulties who have children with mental health problems. 
Parents received 16 home-based appointments to learn new parenting skills and 
improve their children’s difficulties. The research assessed how the Helping 
Families Programme-Modified worked in practice and the viability of evaluation 
methods. A short questionnaire assessing personality difficulties, rather than a 
lengthy diagnostic interview, was more effective and acceptable for identifying 
parents who may benefit from the Helping Families Programme-Modified. Parents 
taking part had high levels of personal, family and social problems. This slowed 
the rate at which parents agreed to take part in the evaluation and lengthened 
the intervention period. The research tested parent agreement to being randomly 
allocated to receive either the Helping Families Programme-Modified or usual 
care plus a specially designed parenting appointment. Although this random 
allocation was feasible, parents were disappointed when they did not receive the 
Helping Families Programme-Modified. They often felt overwhelmed by family 
difficulties and lacked other suitable services. These parents were less likely 
to take up the additional parenting appointment available or to provide 
subsequent research information, which affected the certainty of the research 
findings. Parents receiving the Helping Families Programme-Modified or usual 
care reported improvements, with a potentially greater impact on parents and 
children, and better acceptability, for the new intervention. Parents generally 
supported the tailored, home-based approach of the Helping Families 
Programme-Modified, and they valued its content, therapist skills and 
persistence. It was uncertain whether the new intervention increased or reduced 
service costs. These results will be used to plan the most suitable methods for 
a large-scale evaluation of the Helping Families Programme-Modified.

The phylogeny and biogeography of the genus Paphiopedilum were evaluated by 
using phylogenetic trees derived from analysis of nuclear ribosomal internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, the plastid trnL intron, the trnL-F spacer, 
and the atpB-rbcL spacer. This genus was divided into three subgenera: 
Parvisepalum, Brachypetalum, and Paphiopedilum. Each of them is monophyletic 
with high bootstrap supports according to the highly resolved phylogenetic tree 
reconstructed by combined sequences. There are five sections within the subgenus 
Paphiopedilum, including Coryopedilum, Pardalopetalum, Cochlopetalum, 
Paphiopedilum, and Barbata. The subgenus Parvisepalum is phylogenetic basal, 
which suggesting that Parvisepalum is comprising more ancestral characters than 
other subgenera. The evolutionary trend of genus Paphiopedilum was deduced based 
on the maximum likelihood (ML) tree and Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling 
Trees (BEAST). Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies (RASP) analyses based 
on the combined sequence data. The biogeographic analysis indicates that 
Paphiopedilum species were firstly derived in Southern China and Southeast Asia, 
subsequently dispersed into the Southeast Asian archipelagoes. The subgenera 
Paphiopedilum was likely derived after these historical dispersals and 
vicariance events. Our research reveals the relevance of the differentiation of 
Paphiopedilum in Southeast Asia and geological history. Moreover, the 
biogeographic analysis explains that the significant evolutionary hotspots of 
these orchids in the Sundaland and Wallacea might be attributed to repeated 
migration and isolation events between the south-eastern Asia mainland and the 
Sunda Super Islands.

Objective Our study was performed to identify the clinical findings, risk 
factors, and complications of deep neck space infections (DNSI) at our center 
and compare our experience with the experiences of others. Methods 
Retrospectively, 183 cases of DNSI met our inclusion criteria from 2000 to 2018 
at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) in Jeddah, Western Region, Saudi Arabia. 
Results In our study, analysis showed that males are more likely to have DNSI 
(88.7%). The most common site of infection is the peritonsillar abscess (30.6%). 
Dental infections were found to be the most common etiological factor for 
DNSI (42.6%). Streptococcus pyogenes was found to be the most common 
microorganism (39.3%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (21.3%). Diabetes and 
hypertension (45.2% and 23.7%, respectively) are the most commonly associated 
disorders in patients with DNSI. Extension to another space was the most common 
complication of DNSI. Conclusion Despite the wide usage of antibiotics, DNSI 
still occur and are life-threatening conditions that need urgent management to 
avoid unpleasant complications.

Effects of lysozyme (LYS) combined with cinnamaldehyde (CA) on quality 
enhancement of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) fillets during 
refrigerated storage at 4 °C for 20 days were assessed. Changes of total viable 
count (TVC), K-value, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid 
(TBA), texture profile analysis (TPA), and trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide 
(TCA-soluble peptide) in samples were determined periodically. Results 
demonstrated that the combination of LYS and CA treatment enhanced the 
antibacterial activity against S. putrefaciens and P. fluorescens, and lowered 
TVC values. Meanwhile, LYS combined with CA significantly retarded the increases 
of TBA value, TVB-N, K-value, and TCA-soluble peptide content compared to the 
control. Furthermore, the combined treatment also effectively maintained the 
texture properties of flounder fillets during the storage period. The efficiency 
was better than that of LYS or CA treatment alone. Thus, LYS combined with CA is 
promising in olive flounder shelf life extension.

African-American women have embraced the role of a 'Superwoman' and felt a sense 
of pride in being able to manage multiple roles. The responsibilities associated 
with multiple roles can be overwhelming, especially when experiencing injustices 
(e.g., microaggression and role strain) while performing roles both at work and 
at home. African-American women remain the most disrespected and vulnerable 
population currently in healthcare as well as having the highest cardiovascular 
adverse event rate in the 20 to 49 years of age range. Chronic exposure to
