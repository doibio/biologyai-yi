enrolled and assigned to one of four weight management programs (Healthy Choices 
Healthy Changes: HCHC) and n = 661 were enrolled and assigned to one of three 
smoking cessation interventions (Breathe Well Live Well: BWLW). Following 
assignment to an intervention, participants were randomized to receive financial 
incentives (to attend weight management programs, or to achieve abstinence from 
smoking) or not. Data were collected at baseline and every 3 months for 
12 months.
DISCUSSION: New Hampshire's HCHC and BWLW programs were designed to address 
serious and preventable health disparities by providing incentivized health 
promotion programs to overweight/obese and/or tobacco-smoking Medicaid 
beneficiaries with mental illness. This study was an unprecedented opportunity 
to evaluate an innovative statewide implementation of incentivized health 
promotion targeting the most at-risk and costly beneficiaries. If proven 
effective, this program has the potential to serve as a national model for 
widespread implementation.

N6-methyladenine (6mA), as a newly reported epigenetic marker, plays significant 
roles in regulation of various biological processes in eukaryotes. However, the 
effect of 6mA on human DNA replication remain elusive. In this work, we used 
Y-family human DNA polymerase η as a model to investigate the kinetics of bypass 
of 6mA by hPol η. We found 6mA and its intermediate hypoxanthine (I) on template 
partially inhibited DNA replication by hPol η. dTMP incorporation opposite 6mA 
and dCMP incorporation opposite I can be considered as correct incorporation. 
However, both 6mA and I reduced correct incorporation efficiency, next-base 
extension efficiency, and the priority in extension beyond correct base pair. 
Both dTMP incorporation opposite 6mA and dCTP opposite I showed fast burst 
phases. However, 6mA and I reduced the burst incorporation rates (kpol) and 
increased the dissociation constant (Kd,dNTP), compared with that of dTMP 
incorporation opposite unmodified A. Biophysical binding assays revealed that 
both 6mA and I on template reduced the binding affinity of hPol η to DNA in 
binary or ternary complex compared with unmodified A. All the results explain 
the inhibition effects of 6mA and I on DNA replication by hPol η, providing new 
insight in the effects of epigenetically modified 6mA on human DNA replication.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizers, also known as inhibitors 
of HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors enzymes, are novel 
small-molecule agents to treat renal anemia. They increase endogenous 
erythropoietin (EPO) production by stabilizing HIF. This review focuses on the 
mechanisms by which PHD inhibitors ameliorate anemia in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) and summarizes the current clinical experience with and prospects for 
these drugs.
SUMMARY: Anemia is a serious complication of CKD and is an independent risk 
factor for congestive heart failure. Appropriate treatment of anemia is 
important in the management of advanced stage CKD, as it might help to extend 
life expectancy and improve the physical function of patients with CKD. However, 
at present, adverse effects of treatment, such as thromboembolic events, as well 
as high therapeutic cost have a negative impact on society. PHD inhibitors 
stabilize the transcription factor HIF, increasing the expression of downstream 
target genes, including EPO and enzymes involved in iron metabolism, resulting 
in increased EPO production and improved iron utilization. Key Messages: The 
potential advantages of PHD inhibitors over conventional EPO-based therapies 
include a more physiologic response to renal anemia, noninvasive oral 
administration, and lower cost. Phase III trials of more than 5 PHD inhibitors 
are ongoing, with overall demonstration of success in increasing hemoglobin 
levels. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of PHD inhibitors in 
improving renal anemia in CKD and summarize the current clinical findings 
regarding these drugs.

Urban sprawl has several negative impacts on the environment, the economy, and 
human health. The main objective of this work was to formulate and validate a 
sprawl/compactness index for Sicilian municipalities and evaluate its 
association with health outcomes. An ecological study was conducted with 110 
municipalities in Sicily, Italy. Principal component analysis was adopted to 
create the sprawl/compactness Sicilian index, and linear regression analysis was 
used to evaluate the association between the sprawl index and health outcomes. 
More variance of the new sprawl index was explained by the working factor, 
followed by density, surface extension, and land use mix. When validating the 
index, we found that public transportation had an inverse relation with sprawl 
increase (p < 0.001), and private transportation was directly related to the 
increase in sprawl (p < 0.001). After controlling for the Sicilian 
socio-economic deprivation index and overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality 
was the only outcome directly associated with the increase in the sprawl index 
(odds ratio = 0.0068, p < 0.001). Urban sprawl has to be monitored in Sicily 
over time to understand the evolution of the urbanization phenomenon and its 
relationship with health outcomes such as cardiovascular mortality. The use of 
the sprawl index should help policymakers define the necessary strategic aspects 
and actions to improve human health and quality of life in cities through a 
multi-sectorial approach.

BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in High-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) 
has led to tremendous improvements in the detection and reconstruction of both 
expressed coding and non-coding RNA transcripts. Yet, the complete and accurate 
annotation of the complex transcriptional output of not only the human genome 
has remained elusive. One of the critical bottlenecks in this endeavor is the 
computational reconstruction of transcript structures, due to high noise levels, 
technological limits, and other biases in the raw data.
RESULTS: We introduce several new and improved algorithms in a novel workflow 
for transcript assembly and quantification. We propose an extension of the 
common splice graph framework that combines aspects of overlap and bin graphs 
and makes it possible to efficiently use both multi-splice and paired-end 
information to the fullest extent. Phasing information of reads is used to 
further resolve loci. The decomposition of read coverage patterns is modeled as 
a minimum-cost flow problem to account for the unavoidable non-uniformities of 
RNA-seq data.
CONCLUSION: Its performance compares favorably with state of the art methods on 
both simulated and real-life datasets. Ryūtō calls 1-4% more true transcripts, 
while calling 5-35% less false predictions compared to the next best competitor.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to improve the measurement of 
participation. Research questions were as follows: (1) What constitutes 
participation according to adults? (2) Do they mention participation subdomains 
that are not covered in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS) item bank "Ability to Participate in Social Roles and 
Activities"?
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 adults from the 
general population. Interviews were thematically analysed using the 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as 
conceptual framework. Thereafter, assigned codes were compared to PROMIS item 
bank.
RESULTS: Participants mentioned a variety of participation subdomains that were 
meaningful to them, such as socializing and employment. All subdomains could be 
classified into the ICF. The following subdomains were not covered by the PROMIS 
item bank: acquisition of necessities, education life, economic life, community 
life, and religion and spirituality. Also a distinction between remunerative 
(i.e. paid) and non-remunerative (i.e. unpaid) employment, and domestic life was 
missing. Several ICF sub-codes were not mentioned, such as ceremonies.
CONCLUSIONS: Many participation subdomains were mentioned to be meaningful. As 
several of these subdomains are not covered in the PROMIS item bank, it may 
benefit from extension with new (patient-)reported subdomains of participation.

Linked pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic models provide a structured approach 
for assessing the value of candidate drugs in development. The aim of this study 
was to assess the utility of such an approach for identifying the properties of 
xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOi) providing improved forgiveness to nonadherence 
and estimate the maximum reimbursement price. The pharmacometric and 
pharmacoeconomic models were used to simulate the time course of serum uric acid 
concentrations and estimate quality-adjusted life years and costs for the XOi 
febuxostat and a range of hypothetical analogues. Compounds with reduced 
clearance or increased potency were more forgiving to missed doses, however, 
even following relatively large changes in these properties the predicted 
maximum reimbursement prices represented an increase of only 19% above 
febuxostat 80 mg. Linked pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic modeling methods 
have the potential to inform early drug development by providing an indication 
of pricing options that may permit reimbursement.

INTRODUCTION: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is fatal if not diagnosed and treated. 
This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic-therapeutic 
alternatives for VL in Brazil.
METHODS: A decision model estimated the life expectancy and costs of six 
diagnostic-therapeutic strategies.
RESULTS: IT LEISH + liposomal amphotericin B emerged the best option, presenting 
lower costs and higher effectiveness. DAT-LPC + liposomal amphotericin B showed 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 326.31 per life year.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the feasibility of incorporating DAT and 
designating liposomal amphotericin B as the first-line drug for VL in Brazil.

In recent years, there is a growing interest in new medical applications of 
botulinum toxin, including pain control, osteoarthritis treatment, and wound 
healing. While clinical applications of botulinum toxin seem promising, existing 
evidence regarding the therapeutic effects is still inadequate. The aim was to 
assess the efficacy of a single injection of abobotulinumtoxin A into the knee 
joint cavity to reduce pain in elderly people. We carried out a single group 
clinical trial in a University Hospital. Thirty participants (24 women) more 
than 50 years of age with knee osteoarthritis were included. Diagnosis of 
osteoarthritis was based on clinical and radiologic findings. We gave a single 
injection containing 250 units of Dysport (= 100 units of botulinum neurotoxin 
type A) diluted with 5 ml of normal saline. The primary outcome measure was knee 
pain. The secondary outcome was the patients' opinion about their knee and 
associated problems measured with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score. The outcomes were measured at the baseline and at 4 weeks after the 
intervention. Within-group comparisons based on the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores showed favorable results for joint pain and 
stiffness, sports, severity of symptoms, quality of life, and daily activities 
(all p-values < 0.001). Also, pain intensity, joint effusion, knee clicking and 
locking, and flexion-extension scores showed significant beneficial results (all 
p-values ≤ 0.005). We concluded that botulinum neurotoxin type A is an effective 
and safe initial treatment of knee osteoarthritis with clear clinical 
advantages. Patients' satisfaction, minimum adverse effects in addition to 
single-dose prescription make the toxin as a choice for the first-line therapy 
of osteoarthritis at least at the short-term in elderly people. The symptom 
relief increases the patient's compliance and willing to participate in other 
therapeutic programs. REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT)

Dietary Change Scenarios and Implications for Environmental, Nutrition, Human 
Health and Economic Dimensions of Food Sustainability.

Demand side interventions, such as dietary change, can significantly contribute 
towards the achievement of 2030 national sustainable development goals. However, 
most previous studies analysing the consequences of dietary change focus on a 
single dimension of sustainability (e.g., environment) using a limited number of 
indicators and dietary scenarios. A multi-dimension and multi-indicator analysis 
can identify the potential trade-offs. Here, starting from the current food 
consumption data (year 2011), we first designed nine alternative dietary 
scenarios (healthy Swiss diet, healthy global diet, vegetarian, vegan, 
pescatarian, flexitarian, protein-oriented and meat-oriented diets and a food 
greenhouse gas tax diet). Next we calculated three nutritional quality (nutrient 
balance score, disqualifying nutrient score, percent population with adequate 
nutrition), five environmental (greenhouse gas, water, land, nitrogen and 
phosphorus use), one economic (daily food expenditure) and one human health 
indicator (DALYs) for current and alternative diets. We found that transition 
towards a healthy diet following the guidelines of Swiss society of nutrition is 
the most sustainable option and is projected to result in 36% lesser 
environmental footprint, 33% lesser expenditure and 2.67% lower adverse health 
outcome (DALYs) compared with the current diet. On the other extreme, transition 
towards a meat or protein oriented diet can lead to large increases in diet 
related adverse health outcomes, environmental footprint, daily food expenditure 
and a reduction in intakes of essential nutrients (for Vitamin C, Fibre, 
Potassium and Calcium). We found that shifting to the vegetarian and vegan diet 
scenarios might lead to a reduction in intakes of certain micronutrients 
currently supplied primarily by animal-sourced foods (Vitamin B12, Choline and 
Calcium). Results show that achieving a sustainable diet would entail a high 
reduction in the intake of meat and vegetable oils and a moderate reduction in 
cereals, roots and fish products and at the same time increased intake of 
legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables. We identify several current data 
and research gaps that need to be filled in order to get more accurate results. 
Overall, our analysis underscores the need to consider multiple indicators while 
assessing the dietary sustainability and provides a template to conduct such 
studies in other countries and settings. Future efforts should focus on 
assessing the potential of different interventions and policies that can help 
transition the population from current to sustainable dietary patterns.

High Level of Circulating Microparticles in Patients with BCR/ABL Negative 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasm - a Pilot Study.

[Article in English]

Aswad MH, Kissová J, Rihova L, Zavrelova J, Ovesná P, Penka M.

BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are small (0.1-1 &#956;m) cell-derived vesicles 
released during activation or apoptosis, with a surface-exposed 
phosphatidylserine along with antigens indicating the cellular origin. The level 
of MPs is known to be elevated in thromboembolic diseases and malignancies; it 
is believed that MPs are not only amplifying but can also initiate the 
thrombogenesis processes. BCR/ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) 
are clonal haematopoietic diseases, which include polycythemia vera, essential 
thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. One of the main problems of MPN 
patients is high risk and incidence of thrombosis which affect the survival, 
quality of life and life expectancy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical significance of circulating MPs was assessed 
in a group of 179 patients with BCR/ABL-negative MPNs. Analysis of MPs was done 
using flow cytometry on 417 samples, and MPs procoagulation activity was 
performed using a functional assay called Zymuphen MP-activity (Hyphen Biomed, 
Neuville-sur-oise, France) on 274 samples.
RESULTS: Significantly higher absolute and relative count of platelet MPs was 
found in MPN patients when compared with healthy group, respectively (p = 0.001, 
p = 0.043). Erythrocyte MPs were also significantly higher in MPN patients than 
in the healthy group (p &lt; 0.001). Procoagulation activity of MPs was as well 
significantly higher in patients compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). 
Patients with primary myelofibrosis had decreased absolute and relative count of 
platelet MPs compared to polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia 
patients, respectively (p = 0.008, p = 0.014). Presence of JAK2V617F mutation 
was associated with higher absolute and relative count of platelet MPs, 
respectively (p = 0.045, p = 0.029).
CONCLUSION: Although some literature data support the hypothesis of a direct 
relation between MPs and thrombotic events in MPN patients, further studies are 
needed to evaluate the clinical implication of MPs in the hypercoagulation state 
of MPN patients.

and 6, England.
PARTICIPANTS: 1508 survey respondents were used to model weight change among the 
population of England aged 4-80 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Calorie change, weight change, and body mass index change 
were estimated for children and adults. Impact on non-communicable disease 
incidence, quality adjusted life years, and healthcare costs were estimated for 
adults. Changes to disease burden were modelled with the PRIMEtime-CE Model, 
based on the 2014 population in England aged 18-80.
RESULTS: If the sugar reduction programme was achieved in its entirety and 
resulted in the planned sugar reduction, then the calorie reduction was 
estimated to be 25 kcal/day (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ) for 4-10 year olds (95% 
confidence interval 23 to 26), 25 kcal/day (24 to 28) for 11-18 year olds, and 
19 kcal/day (17 to 20) for adults. The reduction in obesity could represent 5.5% 
of the baseline obese population of 4-10 year olds, 2.2% of obese 11-18 year 
olds, and 5.5% of obese 19-80 year olds. A modelled 51 729 quality adjusted life 
years (95% uncertainty interval 45 768 to 57 242) were saved over 10 years, 
including 154 550 (132 623 to 174 604) cases of diabetes and relating to a net 
healthcare saving of £285.8m (€332.5m, $373.5m; £249.7m to £319.8m).
CONCLUSIONS: The UK government's sugar reduction programme could reduce the 
burden of obesity and obesity related disease, provided that reductions in sugar 
levels and portion sizes do not prompt unanticipated changes in eating patterns 
or product formulation.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has infected more than 80% of the population. 
Reactivation of the virus causes diseases ranging in severity from benign cold 
sores to fatal encephalitis. Current treatments involve viral DNA replication 
inhibitors, but the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is observed frequently, 
highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies. Infected cell protein 0 
(ICP0) of HSV-1 is encoded by an immediate early gene and plays a fundamental 
role during infection, because it enables viral gene expression and blocks 
antiviral responses. One mechanism by which ICP0 functions is through an E3 
ubiquitin ligase activity that induces the degradation of targeted proteins. A 
ΔICP0 virus or mutants with deficiencies in E3 ligase activity cannot counteract 
beta interferon (IFN-β)-induced restriction of viral infection, are highly 
immunogenic, are avirulent, and fail to spread. Thus, small molecules 
interfering with essential and conserved ICP0 functions are expected to 
compromise HSV-1 infection. We have developed a high-throughput screening assay, 
based on the autoubiquitination properties of ICP0, to identify small-molecule 
inhibitors of ICP0 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Through a pilot screening 
procedure, we identified nine compounds that displayed dose-dependent inhibitory 
effects on ICP0 but not on Mdm2, a control E3 ubiquitin ligase. Following 
validation, one compound displayed ICP0-dependent inhibition of HSV-1 infection. 
This compound appeared to bind ICP0 in a cellular thermal shift assay, it 
blocked ICP0 self-elimination, and it blocked wild-type but not ICP0-null virus 
gene expression. This scaffold displays specificity and could be used to develop 
optimized ICP0 E3 ligase inhibitors.IMPORTANCE Since acyclovir and its 
derivatives were launched for herpesviruses control almost four decades ago, the 
search for novel antivirals has waned. However, as human life expectancy has 
increased, so has the number of immunocompromised individuals who receive 
prolonged treatment for HSV recurrences. This has led to an increase in 
unresponsive patients due to acquired viral drug resistance. Thus, novel 
treatments need to be explored. Here we explored the HSV-1 ICP0 E3 ligase as a 
potential antiviral target because (i) ICP0 is expressed before virus 
replication, (ii) it is essential for infection in vivo, (iii) it is required 
for efficient reactivation of the virus from latency, (iv) inhibition of its E3 
ligase activity would sustain host immune responses, and (v) it is shared by 
other herpesviruses. We report a compound that inhibits HSV-1 infection in an 
ICP0-dependent manner by inhibiting ICP0 E3 ligase activity.

Fungal Rhinosinusitis: Unravelling the Disease Spectrum.

Fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS), once considered a rare disease, has seen a steep 
rise in incidence in recent times. This global rise in the burden of fungal 
disease is a consequence of an increment in the population with weakened immune 
systems. Increased life expectancy with rise in conditions like diabetes 
mellitus, medical advancements with invasive interventions, use of 
immunosuppressive drugs and chemo-radiotherapy all lead to unique risk 
situations. The situation becomes more alarming with the fact that there has 
been a significant rise in cases in immune-competent hosts with no predisposing 
factors. FRS represents a wide spectrum of disease ranging from the mild form of 
superficial colonization, allergic manifestations to life threatening extensive 
invasive disease. The categorization of disease into acute and chronic and 
invasive or noninvasive is important factor with implications in disease 
management and prognosis and this has been emphasized greatly in recent years. 
Diagnosis of FRS has been a challenge as the presenting clinical signs and 
symptoms and radiographic manifestations are often nonspecific. Definitive 
diagnosis requires direct fungi identification and hence culture and microscopic 
examination remain the gold standard. Availability of advanced and rapid 
diagnostic techniques is rare in majority of developing nations. Therapeutic 
dilemmas are another aspect of the management of FRS as in spite of the 
availability of new antifungal drugs, treatment is often empirical due to 
non-availability of early diagnosis, rapid disease progression and high costs of 
antifungal drugs. A description of the different types of FRS, their diagnosis 
and management has been presented in this review.

Variance in longevity among individuals may arise as an effect of heterogeneity 
(differences in mortality rates experienced at the same age or stage) or as an 
effect of individual stochasticity (the outcome of random demographic events 
during the life cycle). Decomposing the variance into components due to 
heterogeneity and stochasticity is crucial for evolutionary analyses.In this 
study, we analyze longevity from ten studies of invertebrates in the laboratory, 
and use the results to partition the variance in longevity into its components. 
To do so, we fit finite mixtures of Weibull survival functions to each data set 
by maximum likelihood, using the EM algorithm. We used the Bayesian Information 
Criterion to select the most well supported model. The results of the mixture 
analysis were used to construct an age × stage-classified matrix model, with 
heterogeneity groups as stages, from which we calculated the variance in 
longevity and its components. Almost all data sets revealed evidence of some 
degree of heterogeneity. The median contribution of unobserved heterogeneity to 
the total variance was 35%, with the remaining 65% due to stochasticity. The 
differences among groups in mean longevity were typically on the order of 30% of 
the overall life expectancy. There was considerable variation among data sets in 
both the magnitude of heterogeneity and the proportion of variance due to 
heterogeneity, but no clear patterns were apparent in relation to sex, taxon, or 
environmental conditions.

Significant advances in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have 
occurred in recent times, with life expectancy now approaching the normal 
population. Therefore, patients with HIV will increasingly be undergoing joint 
replacement in the future, however concerns remain regarding the complications 
and outcome in this patient cohort. The aim was to assess the outcome of total 
hip and knee arthroplasty in HIV-infected patients. A systematic search of the 
literature using MOOSE reporting guidelines was performed to assess the outcome 
of hip and knee arthroplasty in HIV-infected patients. The primary outcome was 
infection. Secondary outcome was all-cause revision. The search yielded 552 
results, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 5.819.412 joint 
replacements. The overall quality of the studies was poor with significant 
heterogeneity between the studies. Infection and revision appeared to be more 
likely to occur in HIV positive patients compared to HIV negative patients. A 
subgroup analysis of four studies revealed a risk ratio of 3.31 and 2.25 for 
increase in infection and revision respectively in HIV positive patients. This 
systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates an increased risk of infection 
and revision in HIV infected patients undergoing total hip and knee 
arthroplasty. However, these findings are based on poor quality evidence in a 
limited number of studies and need to be interpreted with caution. Further 
research should concentrate on large, well-designed, prospective studies, that 
control for co-morbidities and employ standardised outcome measures to allow for 
direct comparison.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential impact of reduction in salt intake on the 
burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature mortality in Cameroon.
METHODS: Using a multicohort proportional multistate life table model with 
Markov process, we modelled the impact of WHO's recommended 30% relative 
reduction in population-wide sodium intake on the CVD burden for Cameroonian 
adults alive in 2016. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted and used to quantify uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over the lifetime, incidence is predicted to decrease by 5.2% (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 4.6 to 5.7) for ischaemic heart disease (IHD), 6.6% 
(95% UI 5.9 to 7.4) for haemorrhagic strokes, 4.8% (95% UI 4.2 to 5.4) for 
ischaemic strokes and 12.9% (95% UI 12.4 to 13.5) for hypertensive heart disease 
(HHD). Mortality over the lifetime is projected to reduce by 5.1% (95% UI 4.5 to 
5.6) for IHD, by 6.9% (95% UI 6.1 to 7.7) for haemorrhagic stroke, by 4.5% (95% 
UI 4.0 to 5.1) for ischaemic stroke and by 13.3% (95% UI 12.9 to 13.7) for HHD. 
About 776 400 (95% UI 712 600 to 841 200) health-adjusted life years could be 
gained, and life expectancy might increase by 0.23 years and 0.20 years for men 
and women, respectively. A projected 16.8% change (reduction) between 2016 and 
2030 in probability of premature mortality due to CVD would occur if population 
salt reduction recommended by WHO is attained.
CONCLUSION: Achieving the 30% reduction in sodium intake recommended by WHO 
could considerably decrease the burden of CVD. Targeting blood pressure via 
decreasing population salt intake could translate in significant reductions in 
premature CVD mortality in Cameroon by 2030.

Platycladus orientalis L. (Cupressaceae) has a lifespan of thousands of years. 
Ancient trees have very high scientific, economic and cultural values. The 
senescence of ancient trees is a new research area but is poorly understood. 
Leaves are the primary and the most sensitive organ of a tree. To understand 
leaf structural response to tree senescence in ancient trees, experiments 
investigating the morphology, anatomy and ultrastructure were conducted with 
one-year leaves of ancient P. orientalis (ancient tree >2,000 years) at three 
different tree senescent levels (healthy, sub-healthy and senescent) at the 
world's largest planted pure forest in the Mausoleum of Yellow Emperor, Shaanxi 
Province, China. Observations showed that leaf structure significantly changed 
with the senescence of trees. The chloroplast, mitochondria, vacuole and cell 
wall of mesophyll cells were the most significant markers of cellular 
ultrastructure during tree senescence. Leaf ultrastructure clearly reflected the 
senescence degree of ancient trees, confirming the visual evaluation from 
above-ground parts of trees. Understanding the relationships between leaf 
structure and tree senescence can support decision makers in planning the 
protection of ancient trees more promptly and effectively by adopting the timely 
rejuvenation techniques before the whole tree irreversibly recesses.

PURPOSE: Treatments for breast cancer can lead to chronic musculoskeletal 
problems. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence surrounding the 
cost-effectiveness of exercise and physiotherapy interventions aimed at reducing 
the risk of physical symptoms and functional limitations due to breast cancer 
treatment.
METHODS: A systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of exercise and 
physiotherapy interventions during and following treatment for breast cancer was 
undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. Literature searches were carried out 
in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, EconLit, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus 
and the Cochrane Library. Cost-effectiveness evidence was summarised in a 
descriptive manner and studies were assessed using quality appraisal tools. The 
review protocol was registered on PROSPERO.
RESULTS: A total of 7783 articles were identified and seven were included in the 
final review. Five studies undertook trial-based economic evaluations, whereas 
two studies conducted economic evaluation based on decision models. One study 
was a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), three undertook stand-alone 
cost-utility analyses (CUA) and three studies were combined CEAs and CUAs. Three 
studies reported favourable cost-effectiveness results for different exercise or 
physiotherapy interventions. In contrast, four studies found that exercise and 
physiotherapy interventions were not cost-effective on the basis of 
quality-adjusted life year outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of exercise and 
physiotherapy interventions for the treatment of breast cancer remains sparse 
with contrasting conclusions. Future research should particularly aim to broaden 
the evidence base by disentangling the contributing effects of frequency, 
intensity, time and type of exercise and physiotherapy interventions on 
cost-effectiveness outcomes.

To understand how migratory behavior evolved and to predict how migratory 
species will respond to global environmental change it is important to quantify 
the fitness consequences of intra- and inter-individual variation in migratory 
behavior. Intra-individual variation includes behavioral responses to changing 
environmental conditions and hence behavioral plasticity in the context of novel 
or variable conditions. Inter-individual variation determines the degree of 
variation on which selection can act and the rate of evolutionary responses to 
changes in average and extreme environmental conditions. Here we focus on 
variation in the partial migratory behavior of giant Galápagos tortoises 
(Chelonoidis spp.) and its energetic consequences. We evaluate the extent and 
mechanisms by which tortoises adjust migration timing in response to varying 
annual environmental conditions, and integrate movement data within a 
bioenergetic model of tortoise migration to quantify the fitness consequences of 
migration timing. We find strong inter-individual variation in the timing of 
migration, which was not affected by environmental conditions prevailing at the 
time of migration but rather by average expectations estimated from multi-annual 
averaged conditions. This variation is associated with an average annual loss in 
efficiency of ~15% relative to optimal timing based on year-specific conditions. 
These results point towards a limited ability of tortoises to adjust the timing 
of their migrations based on prevailing (and, by extension, future) conditions, 
suggesting that the adaptability of tortoise migratory behavior to changing 
conditions is predicated more by past "normal" conditions than responses to 
prevailing, changing conditions. Our work offers insights into the level of 
environmental-tuning in migratory behavior and a general framework for future 
research across taxa.

OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of severe-profoundly deaf adult unilateral 
cochlear implant (CI) users receive bimodal stimulation; that is, they use a 
conventional acoustic hearing aid (HA) in their nonimplanted ear. The 
combination of electric and contralateral acoustic hearing provides additional 
benefits to hearing and also to general health-related quality of life compared 
with unilateral CI use. Bilateral CI is a treatment alternative to both 
unilateral CI and bimodal stimulation in some healthcare systems. The objective 
of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of bimodal stimulation 
compared with other management options for adults with bilateral severe to 
profound deafness.
DESIGN: The economic evaluation took the form of a cost-utility analysis and 
compared bimodal stimulation (CI+HA) to two treatment alternatives: unilateral 
and bilateral CI. The analysis used a public healthcare system perspective based 
on data from the United Kingdom and the United States. Costs and health benefits 
were identified for both alternatives and estimated across a patient's lifetime 
using Markov state transition models. Utilities were based on Health Utilities 
Index estimates, and health outcomes were expressed in Quality Adjusted Life 
Years (QALYs). The results were presented using the Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio and the Net Monetary Benefit approach to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of bimodal stimulation. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
explored the degree of overall uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses and analysis of covariance identified 
parameters to which the model was most sensitive; that is, whose values had a 
strong influence on the intervention that was determined to be most 
cost-effective. A value of information analysis was performed to determine the 
potential value to be gained from additional research on bimodal stimulation.
RESULTS: The base case model showed that bimodal stimulation was the most
