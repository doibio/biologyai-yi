OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a virtual version of the Body 
Project (vBP), a cognitive dissonance-based program, to prevent eating disorders 
(ED) among young women with a subjective sense of body dissatisfaction in the 
Swedish context.
METHOD: A decision tree combined with a Markov model was developed to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of the vBP in a clinical trial population of 149 young 
women (mean age 17 years) with body image concerns. Treatment effect was modeled 
using data from a trial investigating the effects of vBP compared to expressive 
writing (EW) and a do-nothing alternative. Population characteristics and 
intervention costs were sourced from the trial. Other parameters, including 
utilities, treatment costs for ED, and mortality were sourced from the 
literature. The model predicted the costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) related to the prevention of incidence of ED in the modeled population 
until they reached 25 years of age. The study used both a cost-utility and 
return on investment (ROI) framework.
RESULTS: In total, vBP yielded lower costs and larger QALYs than the 
alternatives. The ROI analysis denoted a return of US $152 for every USD 
invested in vBP over 8 years against the do-nothing alternative and US $105 
against EW.
DISCUSSION: vBP is likely to be cost-effective compared to both EW and a 
do-nothing alternative. The ROI from vBP is substantial and could be attractive 
information for decision makers for implementation of this intervention for 
young females at risk of developing ED.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: This study estimates that the vBP is cost-effective for the 
prevention of eating disorders among young women in the Swedish setting, and 
thus is a good investment of public resources.

Anemia is common after kidney transplantation. The etiology may be 
multifactorial, such as causes of anemia in the general population and causes 
that are unique to the kidney transplant setting. Posttransplant anemia, 
particularly when severe, may be associated with adverse effects such as graft 
failure, mortality, and a decline in kidney function. After careful 
investigation, that is, having excluded or treated reversible causes of anemia, 
treatment of anemia in patients with a kidney transplant is based on iron 
supplementation or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), although there are 
no specific guidelines on anemia management in this patient population. Iron 
therapy is often needed, but optimal and safe iron-deficiency management 
strategies remain to be defined. Evidence suggests that ESAs are safe and 
potentially associated with favorable outcomes. Better graft function has been 
reported with ESA use targeting hemoglobin levels higher than those recommended 
in the general population with chronic kidney disease and with no apparent 
increased risk of cardiovascular events. These results require further 
investigation. Data on the use of hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitors are 
limited. Prevention and treatment of anemia in kidney transplantation can 
improve patients' quality of life, life expectancy, allograft function, and 
survival.

Treatment Changes in Breast Cancer Management and De-Escalation of Breast 
Surgery.

A better understanding of tumor biology and new drugs have led to significant 
changes in the management of breast cancer (BC). Radical mastectomy, which had 
been the treatment for BC for more than a century, was based on the hypothesis 
that BC is a local-regional disease. In the 1970s, Fisher's studies showed that 
cancer cells could reach the systemic circulation without passage through the 
regional lymphatic system. Multidisciplinary treatment of BC, which was now 
considered a systemic disease, was started and radical mastectomy was replaced 
by breast-conserving surgery (BCS)+, axillary dissection (AD), systemic 
chemotherapy, hormonotherapy, and radiotherapy in early-stage BC. Modified 
radical mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were applied as a treatment 
for locally advanced BC. However, later clinical studies demonstrated that the 
breast can be preserved in those who respond well to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC). In the early 1990s, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early-stage BC 
(cN0) was performed using blue dye and radioisotope markers. It was shown that 
AD may be avoided in SLN-negative patients, and SLNB has been a standard 
intervention in cN0 patients. In this way, the very serious complications of AD, 
especially lymphedema, were avoided. BC has been shown to be a heterogeneous 
disease and the tumor may be divided into four different molecular subtypes. 
Thus, optimal treatment differed from patient to patient (one size fits all was 
inappropriate), individualized treatments have emerged and over-treatment was 
avoided. The prolongation of life expectancy and the decrease in recurrence led 
to an increase in the rate of BCS, an acceptable cosmetic result with 
oncoplastic surgery, and a better quality of life. The increase in the rate of 
complete response to NAC with new and targeted agents and especially in human 
epidermal growth factor receptor-2+ and triple-negative patients with a poor 
prognosis has led to the use of NAC regardless of cN0. The complete 
disappearance of the tumor after NAC has been reported by some studies, 
suggesting that breast surgery may not be needed. However, other studies have 
shown that vacuum biopsies performed on the tumor bed have a high rate of false 
negativity. Therefore, it is difficult to suggest that there is no need for 
lumpectomy, which is cheaper and safer today. The false negativity rate of SLNB 
is high in patients with cN1 at the time of diagnosis and cN0 after NAC 
(approximately 13%). In order to reduce this rate to ≤5%, clinical studies have 
recommended the use of the dual method, marking the positive lymph node before 
chemotherapy and removing 3-4 nodules with SLN. In summary, a better 
understanding of tumor biology and new drugs have changed the management of BC 
and de-escalate the role of surgical treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Mammographic screening and management of breast cancer (BC) in 
elderly women are controversial and continue to be an important health problem. 
To investigate, through members of the Senologic International Society (SIS), 
the current global practices in BC in elderly women, highlighting topics of 
debate and suggesting perspectives.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The questionnaire was sent to the SIS network and 
included 55 questions on definitions of an elderly woman, BC epidemiology, 
screening, clinical and pathological characteristics, therapeutic management in 
elderly women, onco-geriatric assessment and perspectives.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight respondents from 21 countries and six continents, 
representing a population of 2.86 billion, completed and submitted the survey. 
Most respondents considered women 70 years and older to be elderly. In most 
countries, BC was often diagnosed at an advanced stage compared to younger 
women, and age-related mortality was high. For this reason, participants 
recommended that personalized screening be continued in elderly women with a 
long life expectancy.In addition, this survey highlighted that geriatric frailty 
assessment tools and comprehensive geriatric evaluations needed to be used more 
and should be developed to avoid undertreatment. Similarly, multidisciplinary 
meetings dedicated to elderly women with BC should be encouraged to avoid under- 
and over-treatment and to increase their participation in clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: Due to increased life expectancy, BC in elderly women will become a 
more important field in public health. Therefore, screening, personalized 
treatment, and comprehensive geriatric assessment should be the cornerstones of 
future practice to avoid the current excess of age-related mortality. This 
survey described, through members of the SIS, a global picture of current 
international practices in BC in elderly women.

In animal behavior studies, a common goal is to investigate the causal pathways 
between an exposure and outcome, and a mediator that lies in between. Causal 
mediation analysis provides a principled approach for such studies. Although 
many applications involve longitudinal data, the existing causal mediation 
models are not directly applicable to settings where the mediators are measured 
on irregular time grids. In this paper, we propose a causal mediation model that 
accommodates longitudinal mediators on arbitrary time grids and survival 
outcomes simultaneously. We take a functional data analysis perspective and view 
longitudinal mediators as realizations of underlying smooth stochastic 
processes. We define causal estimands of direct and indirect effects accordingly 
and provide corresponding identification assumptions. We employ a functional 
principal component analysis approach to estimate the mediator process and 
propose a Cox hazard model for the survival outcome that flexibly adjusts the 
mediator process. We then derive a g-computation formula to express the causal 
estimands using the model coefficients. The proposed method is applied to a 
longitudinal data set from the Amboseli Baboon Research Project to investigate 
the causal relationships between early adversity, adult physiological stress 
responses, and survival among wild female baboons. We find that adversity 
experienced in early life has a significant direct effect on females' life 
expectancy and survival probability, but find little evidence that these effects 
were mediated by markers of the stress response in adulthood. We further 
developed a sensitivity analysis method to assess the impact of potential 
violation to the key assumption of sequential ignorability. Supplementary 
materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed growth patterns in patients with 
mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VII before enzyme replacement therapy.
METHODS: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) measurements and Z-scores 
from patients from three clinical studies were compared with those from CDC 
healthy population growth charts. Relationships with age/sex and history of 
non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) were assessed by linear regression and ANOVA, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Among 20 enrolled patients with MPS VII, height Z-scores were near 
normal until 1 year of age but declined thereafter, particularly among males. 
There was no consistent pattern in weight Z-score. BMI Z-scores were above 
normal and increased slightly with age among males and were slightly below 
normal among females. Male patients with a history of NIHF had greater declines 
in height and weight Z-scores over time versus males without history of NIHF. 
There was no clear effect of NIHF history on height and weight Z-scores in 
female patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MPS VII, declines in height Z-score began early in 
life, particularly among males, while changes in BMI varied by sex. Patients 
with MPS VII and a history of NIHF had greater declines in height Z-score with 
age than did patients without a history of NIHF.Clinical trial registration: 
This retrospective analysis included patients enrolled in an open-label phase 2 
study (UX003-CL203; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02418455), a randomized, 
placebo-controlled, blind-start phase 3 study (UX003-CL301; ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT02230566), or its open-label, long-term extension (UX003-CL202; 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02432144). Requests for individual de-identified 
participant data and the clinical study report from this study are available to 
researchers providing a methodologically sound proposal that is in accordance 
with the Ultragenyx data sharing commitment. To gain access, data requestors 
will need to sign a data access and use agreement. Data will be shared via

Background: The Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) was 
established in 2000 to define the incidence and prevalence of local diseases and 
evaluate the impact of community-based interventions. KHDSS morbidity data have 
been reported comprehensively but mortality has not been described. This 
analysis describes mortality in the KHDSS over 16 years. Methods: We calculated 
mortality rates from 2003-2018 in four intervals of equal duration and assessed 
differences in mortality across these intervals by age and sex. We calculated 
the period survival function and median survival using the Kaplan-Meier method 
and mean life expectancies using abridged life tables. We estimated trend and 
seasonality by decomposing a time series of monthly mortality rates. We used 
choropleth maps and random-effects Poisson regression to investigate 
geographical heterogeneity. Results: Mortality declined by 36% overall between 
2003-2018 and by 59% in children aged <5 years. Most of the decline occurred 
between 2003 and 2006. Among adults, the greatest decline (49%) was observed in 
those aged 15-54 years. Life expectancy at birth increased by 12 years. Females 
outlived males by 6 years. Seasonality was only evident in the 1-4 year age 
group in the first four years. Geographical variation in mortality was ±10% of 
the median value and did not change over time. Conclusions: Between 2003 and 
2018, mortality among children and young adults has improved substantially. The 
steep decline in 2003-2006 followed by a much slower reduction thereafter 
suggests improvements in health and wellbeing have plateaued in the last 12 
years. However, there is substantial inequality in mortality experience by 
geographical location.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess the quality of life (QOL) in 
glaucoma patients and find out the sociodemographic factors predicting QOL.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care center from 
August 2021 to February 2022. Subjects diagnosed with glaucoma for at least 6 
months were enrolled. After taking informed consent, demographic details and 
detailed history were collected for all patients. Comprehensive eye examination 
(visual acuity, intraocular pressure, gonioscopy, fundoscopy, visual field 
assessment, ocular coherence tomogram assessment) was done for all and they were 
asked to fill the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Data were collected and analyzed 
using SPSS 21.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine patients were recruited. Mean age of 
participants was 57.99 ± 10.76 years. Based on various domains and subgroups, 
QOL values were significant with respect to income (P = 0.016). Gender-wise QOL 
in females was lower than that of males with respect to all the domains (P = 
0.001). While marital status affected both environmental and social domain, 
literacy affected only the social domain. A variation in intraocular pressure 
affected the QOL in the psychological domain. QOL was not significantly 
associated with the severity of the disease. Gender was the most predominant 
predictor out of all sociodemographic factors.
CONCLUSION: Chronic diseases affect the QOL of individuals in many ways. 
Glaucoma being a chronic disease hampers patients' vision irreversibly and by 
extension the various physical, social, and psychological aspects of the 
patient's life as well. Hence, knowledge of the change in QOL it brings about 
can help plan the treatment, counseling, and management of these patients.

Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is the most commonly noted form of 
mucormycosis, which is the most common secondary fungal infection following 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. 
Osteomyelitis is one of the rare sequelae of ROCM, frontal osteomyelitis being 
the rarest. We present four patients of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19)-associated mucormycosis, who presented with frontal bone 
osteomyelitis after being treated for ROCM surgically and medically. This is the 
first case series highlighting this complication in post-COVID-19 mucormycosis 
patients and needs utmost attention as it can be life-threatening and can cause 
extreme facial disfiguration. All four patients are alive with salvage of the 
affected globe and vision being preserved in one patient. If identified early, 
disfiguration of face and intracranial extension can be avoided.

Background Produce prescription programs, providing free or discounted produce 
and nutrition education to patients with diet-related conditions within health 
care systems, have been shown to improve dietary quality and cardiometabolic 
risk factors. The potential impact of implementing produce prescription programs 
for patients with diabetes on long-term health gains, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness in the United States has not been established. Methods and 
Results We used a validated state-transition microsimulation model (Diabetes, 
Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease Microsimulation model), populated with national 
data of eligible individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey 2013 to 2018, further incorporating estimated intervention effects and 
diet-disease effects from meta-analyses, and policy- and health-related costs 
from published literature. The model estimated that over a lifetime 
(mean=25 years), implementing produce prescriptions in 6.5 million US adults 
with both diabetes and food insecurity (lifetime treatment) would prevent 
292 000 (95% uncertainty interval, 143 000-440 000) cardiovascular disease 
events, generate 260 000 (110000-411 000) quality-adjusted life-years, cost 
$44.3 billion in implementation costs, and save $39.6 billion ($20.5-58.6 
billion) in health care costs and $4.8 billion ($1.84-$7.70 billion) in 
productivity costs. The program was highly cost effective from a health care 
perspective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $18 100/quality-adjusted 
life-years) and cost saving from a societal perspective (net savings: 
$-0.05 billion). The intervention remained cost effective at shorter time 
horizons of 5 and 10 years. Results were similar in population subgroups by age, 
race or ethnicity, education, and baseline insurance status. Conclusions Our 
model suggests that implementing produce prescriptions among US adults with 
diabetes and food insecurity would generate substantial health gains and be 
highly cost effective.

Tumors of the pineal region (TPRs) are rare neoplasms that are surgically 
challenging to resect. Conventional treatment strategies are available, but 
gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an alternative approach. This study presents 
a single-center experience with GKRS performed for TPR with and without 
histopathological diagnoses. The cases of 25 patients with TPRs treated with 
GKRS were retrospectively analyzed. Thirteen of these 25 patients had 
histopathological confirmation, and 13 had elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and 
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels. The 25 patients had a mean follow-up 
duration of 61 months. The total response rate to GKRS was 60%, and a 53.8% 
decrease in the alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels 
was observed. The findings of this study indicate that GKRS is a safe procedure 
for TPRs, even in the event of insufficient histopathological findings. This 
treatment approach provides increased Karnofsky performance scores and an 
extended life expectancy.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of tezepelumab as add-on maintenance 
therapy compared with standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of patients with 
severe asthma in Canada.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cost utility analysis was conducted using a Markov 
cohort model with five health states ("controlled asthma", "uncontrolled 
asthma", "previously controlled asthma with exacerbation", "previously 
uncontrolled asthma with exacerbation", and "death"). Tezepelumab plus SoC was 
compared to SoC (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta 
agonist) using efficacy estimates derived from the NAVIGATOR (NCT03347279) and 
SOURCE (NCT03406078) trials. The model included the costs of therapy, 
administration, resource use for disease management, and adverse events. Utility 
estimates were calculated using a mixed-effects regression analysis of the 
NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials. A Canadian public payer perspective was used with a 
50-year time horizon, a 1.5% annual discount rate, and the base case analysis 
was conducted probabilistically. A key scenario analysis assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of tezepelumab compared with currently reimbursed biologics 
informed by an indirect treatment comparison.
RESULTS: The base case analysis suggested that tezepelumab plus SoC was 
associated with a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of 1.077 compared with 
SoC alone at an incremental cost of $207,101 (2022 Canadian dollars), resulting 
in an incremental cost-utility ratio of $192,357/QALY. The key scenario analysis 
demonstrated that tezepelumab was dominant against all currently reimbursed 
biologics, with higher incremental QALYs (ranging from 0.062 to 0.407) and lower 
incremental costs (ranging from -$6,878 to -$1,974). Additionally, when compared 
against currently reimbursed biologics in Canada, tezepelumab had the highest 
probability of being cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Tezepelumab provided additional life years and QALYs at additional 
cost compared with SoC in Canada. In addition, tezepelumab dominated (i.e. more 
effective, less costly) the other currently reimbursed biologics.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung 
disease (ILD-PH) is associated with significant alteration of quality of life, 
exercise capacity, and survival. Over the past 2 years, there were changes in 
the guideline definition and classification of ILD-PH, and positive randomized 
controlled trials were published.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic lung disease is 
now hemodynamically defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure more than 
20 mmHg, with pulmonary artery wedge pressure 15 mmHg or less, and pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR) at least 2 Wood units. Severe ILD-PH is defined by PVR 
more than 5 Wood units. In the INCREASE trial, patients receiving inhaled 
treprostinil had favorable significant changes in 6-min walk distance, NT-proBNP 
level, clinical worsening events, and forced vital capacity, which were 
maintained in the open label extension study. Promising results were obtained in 
a placebo-controlled pilot trial using escalated doses of inhaled nitric oxide. 
According to European guidelines, patients with ILD-PH should be referred to 
pulmonary hypertension centers, where inhaled treprostinil may be considered; 
phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors may also be considered in patients with 
severe ILD-PH.
SUMMARY: Recent changes in the definitions and a new therapeutic option have an 
impact on the diagnosis and management of ILD-PH.

Depression in dementia with Lewy bodies: a critical update.

Depression with an estimated prevalence of 35% is a frequent manifestation of 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), having negative effects on cognitive 
performance and life expectancy, yet the underlying neurobiology is poorly 
understood and most likely heterogeneous. Depressive symptoms in DLB can occur 
during the clinical course and, together with apathy, is a common prodromal 
neuropsychiatric symptom of this neurocognitive disorder in the group of Lewy 
body synucleinopathies. There are no essential differences in the frequency of 
depression in DLB and Parkinson disease-dementia (PDD), while its severity is up 
to twice as high as in Alzheimer disease (AD). Depression in DLB that is 
frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, has been related to a variety of 
pathogenic mechanisms associated with the basic neurodegenerative process, in 
particular dysfunctions of neurotransmitter systems (decreased 
monoaminergic/serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic metabolism), 
α-synuclein pathology, synaptic zinc dysregulation, proteasome inhibition, gray 
matter volume loss in prefrontal and temporal areas as well as dysfunction of 
neuronal circuits with decreased functional connectivity of specific brain 
networks. Pharmacotherapy should avoid tricyclic antidepressants 
(anticholinergic adverse effects), second-generation antidepressants being a 
better choice, while modified electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic 
stimulation therapy and deep brain stimulation may be effective for 
pharmacotherapy-resistant cases. Since compared to depression in other dementias 
like Alzheimer disease and other parkinsonian syndromes, our knowledge of its 
molecular basis is limited, and further studies to elucidate the heterogeneous 
pathogenesis of depression in DLB are warranted.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most disabling disorders with 
significant comorbidity and mortality. Incidence and prevalence of CKD in cancer 
survivors are remarkably high in both adults and pediatric patients. The reasons 
for this high incidence/prevalence are multifold but kidney damage by cancer 
itself and cancer treatment (pharmacotherapy/surgery/radiation) are the main 
reasons. Since cancer survivors commonly have significant comorbidities, risk of 
cancer recurrence, limited physical function or life expectancy, special 
attentions should be paid when considering the treatment of CKD and its 
complications. Especially, shared decision-making should be considered when 
selecting the renal replacement therapies with as much 
information/facts/evidence as possible.

African Americans (AAs) have higher prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension than 
Whites, which leads to reduced life expectancy. Barriers to achieving blood 
pressure control in AAs include mistrust of healthcare and poor adherence to 
medication and dietary recommendations. We conducted a pilot study of a 
church-based community health worker (CHW) intervention to reduce blood pressure 
among AAs by providing support and strategies to improve diet and medication 
adherence. To increase trust and cultural concordance, we hired and trained 
church members to serve as CHWs. AA adults (n = 79) with poorly controlled blood 
pressure were recruited from churches in a low-income, segregated neighborhood 
of Chicago. Participants had an average of 7.5 visits with CHWs over 6 months. 
Mean change in systolic blood pressure across participants was - 5 mm/Hg 
(p = 0.029). Change was greater among participants (n = 45) with higher baseline 
blood pressure (- 9.2, p = 0.009). Medication adherence increased at follow-up, 
largely due to improved timeliness of medication refills, but adherence to the 
DASH diet decreased slightly. Intervention fidelity was poor. Recordings of CHW 
visits revealed that CHWs did not adhere closely to the intervention protocol, 
especially with regard to assisting participants with action plans for behavior 
change. Participants gave the intervention high ratings for acceptability and 
appropriateness, and slightly lower ratings for feasibility of achieving 
intervention behavioral targets. Participants valued having the intervention 
delivered at their church and preferred a church-based intervention to an 
intervention conducted in a clinical setting. A church-based CHW intervention 
may be effective at reducing blood pressure in AAs.

Exploring global differences in life expectancy can facilitate the development 
of strategies to narrow regional disparities. However, few researchers have 
systematically examined patterns in the evolution of worldwide life expectancy 
over a long time period. Spatial differences among 181 countries in 4 types of 
worldwide life expectancy patterns from 1990 to 2019 were investigated via 
geographic information system (GIS) analysis. The aggregation characteristics of 
the spatiotemporal evolution of life expectancy were revealed by local 
indicators of spatial association. The analysis employed spatiotemporal 
sequence-based kernel density estimation and explored the differences in life 
expectancy among regions with the Theil index. We found that the global life 
expectancy progress rate shows upward then downward patterns over the last 30 
years. Female have higher rates of spatiotemporal progression in life expectancy 
than male, with less internal variation and a wider spatial aggregation. The 
global spatial and temporal autocorrelation of life expectancy shows a weakening 
trend. The difference in life expectancy between male and female is reflected in 
both intrinsic causes of biological differences and extrinsic causes such as 
environment and lifestyle habits. Investment in education pulls apart 
differences in life expectancy over long time series. These results provide 
scientific guidelines for obtaining the highest possible level of health in 
countries around the world.

OBJECTIVE: Mental health problems among older adults are becoming a growing 
public health concern in South Asia due to continued changes in population 
dynamics caused by declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. 
This scoping review aimed to explore and summarize evidence about mental health 
interventions and their impacts on geriatric mental health and highlight gaps 
and areas for future research.
METHODS: We searched six electronic databases and additional sources for 
experimental/non-experimental studies evaluating the effectiveness of geriatric 
mental health interventions in eight countries in the South Asia region from the 
date of inception of each database up to August 5, 2022. Following the 
preliminary screening, we extracted data from the eligible articles using a 
Microsoft Excel data extraction worksheet. We followed Joanna Briggs Institute 
(JBI) guidelines for this scoping review and reported evidence adhering to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist.
RESULTS: From a total of 3432 potential articles retrieved, 19 were included in 
this review following pre-determined eligibility criteria. Across studies, 
mental health interventions can be broadly categorized into the following types- 
1) traditional Yoga, Tai chi, or other meditative movements; 2) behavioral, 
occupational, or learning-based interventions; 3) tech-based interventions; 4) 
music therapy; and 5) new healthcare model. The evidence was predominantly based 
on India (n = 16), whereas three articles were identified from Pakistan. No 
article was found from six other South Asian countries. Depression and anxiety 
were the most frequent mental health outcomes, followed by quality of life, 
cognitive function, self-esteem, physical performance, and many more.
CONCLUSION: Although limited, this review found various interventions that have 
varying effects on different geriatric mental health outcomes. A handful of 
evidence on mental health intervention in South Asia indicates a lack of 
acknowledgment that may develop a serious paucity of geriatric mental health 
practice. Therefore, future researchers are encouraged to conduct empirical 
studies to understand disease burden, including associated factors of geriatric 
mental health, which may help to construct contextually appropriate mental 
health interventions in this region.

To date, Cancer remains a global threat due to its impact on growing life 
expectancy. With the many efforts and methods of combating the disease, complete 
success remains a challenge owing to several limitations including cancer cells 
developing resistance through mutations, off-target effect of some cancer drugs 
resulting in toxicities, among many others. Aberrant DNA methylation is 
understood to be the primary reason for improper gene silence, which can result 
in neoplastic transformation, carcinogenesis, and tumour progression. DNA 
methyltransferase B (DNMT3B) enzyme is considered a potential target for the 
treatment of several cancers due to its important role in DNA methylation. 
However, only a few DNMT3B inhibitors have been reported to date. Herein, in 
silico molecular recognition techniques such as Molecular docking, 
Pharmacophore-based virtual screen and MD simulation were employed to identify 
potential inhibitors of DNMT3B that can halt aberrancy in DNA methylation. 
Findings initially identified 878 hit compounds based on a designed 
pharmacophore model from the reference compound Hypericin. Molecular docking was 
used to rank the hits by testing their efficiency when bound to the target 
enzyme and the top three (3) selected. All three (3) of the top hits showed 
excellent pharmacokinetic properties but two (2) (Zinc33330198 and Zinc77235130) 
were identified to be non-toxic. Molecular dynamic simulation of the final two 
hits showed good stability, flexibility, and structural rigidity of the 
compounds on DNMT3B. Finally, thermodynamic energy estimations show both
