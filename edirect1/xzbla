demographic levels in the State of Qatar.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methods were largely based on the established Global 
Burden of Disease methodology and use the burden of disease in terms of 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and the years lost due to disability 
(YLD) as the outcome measure. We calculated years lost due to disability (YLD) 
and years life lost (YLL) attributable to diabetes. The study was conducted 
during the period from June 2013 to January 2014.
RESULTS: The study findings revealed that disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
has been increasing across the years and reached to 4.35 in 2011 from 2.58 in 
2007. DALYs for men was remarkably higher than women during the period 
(2007-2011). Diabetes mellitus was the 6th leading cause of disease burden in 
Qatar (3.8%). The YLD showed a sharp increase in men (2.52 in 2011 from 1.34 in 
2007) and women (1.05 in 2011 from 0.33 in 2007) during the year 2011. YLL 
portion of women enlarged considerably in 2011 (0.10) compared to 2010 (0.04). 
YLL for men and women was fluctuating across the years with a decrease in 2011 
(18%) from 2007 (35%). Men and women in the age group 30-44 years had the 
highest peak across the years.
CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed that diabetes disease burden was 
considerably high in Qatar, particularly in the working age group. DALYs has 
been increasing across the years.

BACKGROUND: Choroidal metastases (CM) are the most common malignant intraocular 
lesion observed in up to 4-12% of necropsy series of patients with solid cancer. 
The spectrum of presentations varies from prevalent CM in disseminated cancer to 
isolated CM. CM are responsible for visual deterioration. Depending on the 
primary cancer, estimated life expectancy, overall cancer presentation and 
ocular symptoms, the management of CM varies widely. We address the 
multidisciplinary management of CM and technical aspects of radiotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of literature was performed from 1974 
to 2014.
RESULTS: Choroidal metastases occur preferentially in breast and lung carcinomas 
but are reported in all cancer types. The standard treatment remains external 
beam radiotherapy, applying 30Gy in 10 fractions or 40Gy in 20 fractions. The 
reported complete response and improved visual acuity rates are 80% and 57% to 
89%, respectively. Some chemotherapy or new targeted therapy regimens yield 
promising CM response rates.
DISCUSSION: Radiation therapy consistently shows rapid symptom alleviation, 
yield excellent local control and functional outcomes. However, there are only 
few reports on late toxicities after 6months given the unfavorable prognostic of 
CM patients. Selected patients may live more than two years, underlying the need 
to better assess mean and long term outcomes. Some authors have favored 
exclusive systemic strategies with omission of irradiation. The current 
literature suffers from the scarcity of prospective trials. Duration of tumor 
response following systemic therapy is rarely reported but appears less 
favorable as compared to radiotherapy. Systemic treatments may be proposed for 
pauci-symptomatic CM in a polymetastatic context while radiation therapy remains 
necessary in symptomatic CM either upfront or as an alternating treatment. 
Focalized radiation like brachytherapy and proton therapy may be proposed for 
isolated CM with long disease-free interval between primary and CM, as these 
techniques have the potential to yield better tumor and functional outcomes in 
patients with long life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic imaging represents the fastest growing segment of costs 
in the US health system. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of 
alternative diagnostic approaches to meniscus tears of the knee, a highly 
prevalent disease that traditionally relies on MRI as part of the diagnostic 
strategy.
PURPOSE: To identify the most efficient strategy for the diagnosis of meniscus 
tears.
STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: A simple-decision model run as a cost-utility analysis was constructed 
to assess the value added by MRI in various combinations with patient history 
and physical examination (H&P). The model examined traumatic and degenerative 
tears in 2 distinct settings: primary care and orthopaedic sports medicine 
clinic. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER).
RESULTS: In both practice settings, H&P alone was widely preferred for 
degenerative meniscus tears. Performing MRI to confirm a positive H&P was 
preferred for traumatic tears in both practice settings, with a willingness to 
pay of less than US$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Performing an MRI for 
all patients was not preferred in any reasonable clinical scenario. The 
prevalence of a meniscus tear in a clinician's patient population was 
influential. For traumatic tears, MRI to confirm a positive H&P was preferred 
when prevalence was less than 46.7%, with H&P preferred above that. For 
degenerative tears, H&P was preferred until the prevalence reaches 74.2%, and 
then MRI to confirm a negative was the preferred strategy. In both settings, MRI 
to confirm positive physical examination led to more than a 10-fold lower rate 
of unnecessary surgeries than did any other strategy, while MRI to confirm 
negative physical examination led to a 2.08 and 2.26 higher rate than H&P alone 
in primary care and orthopaedic clinics, respectively.
CONCLUSION: For all practitioners, H&P is the preferred strategy for the 
suspected degenerative meniscus tear. An MRI to confirm a positive H&P is 
preferred for traumatic tears for all practitioners. Consideration should be 
given to implementing alternative diagnostic strategies as well as enhancing 
provider education in physical examination skills to improve the reliability of 
H&P as a diagnostic test.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Alternative diagnostic strategies that do not include the 
use of MRI may result in decreased health care costs without harm to the patient 
and could possibly reduce unnecessary procedures.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In the 1980s, a new implant was developed to treat patients 
with intermittent neurogenic claudication caused by lumbar spinal stenosis 
(LSS). This implant is now widely used.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to determine whether a favorable 
cost-effectiveness for interspinous process devices (IPDs) compared with 
conventional bony decompression is attained.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Cost-utility analysis was performed alongside a 
double-blind randomized controlled trial. Five neurosurgical centers (including 
one academic and four secondary level care centers) included participants for 
this study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred fifty-nine patients with LSS were treated with the 
implantation of IPD and with bony decompression. Eighty participants received an 
IPD, and seventy-nine participants underwent spinal bony decompression.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
societal costs in the first year (estimated per quarter), estimated from 
patient-reported utilities (US and The Netherlands EuroQol 5D [EQ-5D] and 
EuroQol visual analog scale) and diaries on costs (health-care costs, patient 
costs, and productivity costs).
METHODS: All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Given the 
statistical uncertainty of differences between costs and QALYs, 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves graph the probability that a strategy is 
cost effective, as a function of willingness to pay. Paradigm Spine funded this 
trial but did not have any part in data analysis or the design and preparation 
of this article.
RESULTS: According to the EQ-5D, the valuation of quality of life after IPD and 
decompression was not different. Mean utilities during all four quarters were, 
not significantly, less favorable after IPD according to the EQ-5D with a 
decrease in QALYs according to the US EQ-5D of 0.024 (95% confidence interval, 
-0.031 to 0.079). From a health-care perspective, the costs of IPD treatment 
were higher (difference €3,030 per patient, 95% confidence interval, 
€561-€5,498). This significant difference is mainly because of additional cost 
of implants of €2,350 apiece. From a societal perspective, a nonsignificant 
difference of €2,762 (95% confidence interval, -€1,572 to €7,095) in favor of 
conventional bony decompression was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of IPD as indirect decompressing device is highly 
unlikely to be cost effective compared with bony decompression for patients with 
intermittent neurogenic claudication caused by LSS.

The 20th century saw an unprecedented increase in average human lifespan as well 
as a rapid decline in human fertility in many countries of the world. The 
accompanying worldwide change in demographics of human populations is linked to 
unanticipated and unprecedented economic, cultural, medical, social, public 
health and public policy challenges, whose full implications on a societal level 
are only just beginning to be fully appreciated. Some of these implications are 
discussed in this commentary, an outcome of Cultures of Health and Ageing, a 
conference co-sponsored by the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) and the Center 
for Healthy Ageing at UCPH, which took place on 20-21 June 2014 in Copenhagen, 
Denmark. Questions discussed here include the following: what is driving 
age-structural change in human populations? how can we create 'age-friendly' 
societies and promote 'ageing-in-community'? what tools will effectively promote 
social engagement and prevent social detachment among older individuals? is 
there a risk that further extension of human lifespan would be a greater burden 
to the individual and to society than is warranted by the potential benefit of 
longer life?

Adipose-derived stem cells were isolated from rats and differentiated to a 
Schwann cell-like phenotype in vitro. The differentiated cells (dADSCs) 
underwent self-alignment in a tethered type-1 collagen gel, followed by 
stabilisation to generate engineered neural tissue (EngNT-dADSC). The 
pro-regenerative phenotype of dADSCs was enhanced by this process, and the 
columns of aligned dADSCs in the aligned collagen matrix supported and guided 
neurite extension in vitro. EngNT-dADSC sheets were rolled to form peripheral 
nerve repair constructs that were implanted within NeuraWrap conduits to bridge 
a 15 mm gap in rat sciatic nerve. After 8 weeks regeneration was assessed using 
immunofluorescence imaging and transmission electron microscopy and compared to 
empty conduit and nerve graft controls. The proportion of axons detected in the 
distal stump was 3.5 fold greater in constructs containing EngNT-dADSC than 
empty tube controls. Our novel combination of technologies that can organise 
autologous therapeutic cells within an artificial tissue construct provides a 
promising new cellular biomaterial for peripheral nerve repair.

Nitric oxide (NO) mediated mechanisms have been implicated in killing of some 
life-stages of Brugia malayi/Wuchereria bancrofti and protect the host through 
type 1 responses and IFN-γ stimulated toxic mediators' release. However, the 
identity of NO stimulating molecules of the parasites is not known. Three 
predominantly NO-stimulating SDS-PAGE resolved fractions F8 (45.24-48.64 kDa), 
F11 (33.44-38.44 kDa) and F12 (28.44-33.44 kDa) from B. malayi were identified 
and their proteins were analyzed by 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF. Tropomyosin, 
calponin and de novo peptides were identified by 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF in F8 
and immunization with F8 conferred most significant protection against 
L3-initiated infection in Mastomys coucha. Immunized animals showed upregulated 
F8-induced NO, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, TGF-β release, cellular proliferative 
responses and specific IgG and IgG1. Anti-IFN-γ, anti-TNF-α, and anti-IL-1β 
significantly reduced F8-mediated NO generation and iNOS induction at protein 
levels. Anti-IFN-γ treated cells showed maximum reduction (>74%) in NO 
generation suggesting a predominant role of IFN-γ in iNOS induction. In 
conclusion, the findings suggest that F8 which contains tropomyosin, calponin 
and de novo peptides protects the host via IFN-γ mediated iNOS induction and may 
hold promise as vaccine candidate(s). This is also the first report of 
identification of tropomyosin and calponin in B. malayi.

BACKGROUND: Limited evidence exists regarding the long-term effects of community 
health worker-led diabetes management programs on health outcomes and 
cost-effectiveness, particularly in low-income, ethnic minority populations.
PURPOSE: To examine the long-term cost-effectiveness and improvements in 
diabetes-related complications of a diabetes education and management 
intervention led by community health workers among uninsured Mexican Americans.
METHODS: Clinical data, changes in hemoglobin A1c over 12 months, and costs from 
an RCT of 180 uninsured Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes conducted in 2006 
were utilized for secondary analyses in 2012. Simulation modeling was used to 
estimate long-term cost and health outcomes using the validated Archimedes 
Model. The absolute differences for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
and cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications were derived by 
comparing intervention and control groups.
RESULTS: During a 20-year time horizon, participants who received the 
intervention would be expected to have significantly lower hemoglobin A1c levels 
(p<0.001), fewer foot ulcers (p<0.001), and a reduced number of foot amputations 
(p=0.005) in comparison with a control group receiving usual medical care. An 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $355 per quality-adjusted life year 
gained was estimated for intervention participants during the same time period.
CONCLUSIONS: A simulated clinical trial suggests that a community health 
worker-led diabetes intervention is a cost-effective way to reduce 
diabetes-related complications for uninsured Mexican Americans during a 20-year 
horizon in comparison to usual medical care.

Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases are neurodegenerative diseases 
presently without effective drug treatments. AD is characterized by general 
cognitive impairment, difficulties with memory consolidation and retrieval, and 
with advanced stages episodes of agitation and anger. AD is increasing in 
frequency as life expectancy increases. Present FDA approved medications do 
little to slow disease progression and none address the underlying progressive 
loss of synaptic connections and neurons. New drug design approaches are needed 
beyond cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. 
Patients with PD experience the symptomatic triad of bradykinesis, 
tremor-at-rest, and rigidity with the possibility of additional non-motor 
symptoms including sleep disturbances, depression, dementia, and autonomic 
nervous system failure. This review summarizes available information regarding 
the role of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in learning and memory and 
motor functions, with particular emphasis on research results suggesting a link 
between angiotensin IV (AngIV) interacting with the AT4 receptor subtype. 
Currently there is controversy over the identity of this AT4 receptor protein. 
Albiston and colleagues have offered convincing evidence that it is the 
insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Recently members of our laboratory have 
presented evidence that the brain AngIV/AT4 receptor system coincides with the 
brain hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met receptor system. In an effort to resolve 
this issue we have synthesized a number of small molecule AngIV-based compounds 
that are metabolically stable, penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and facilitate 
compromised memory and motor systems. These research efforts are described along 
with details concerning a recently synthesized molecule, Dihexa that shows 
promise in overcoming memory and motor dysfunctions by augmenting synaptic 
connectivity via the formation of new functional synapses.

Longer lives and extended retirement have created a 'young old age' stage of 
life. How people spend their "young old age" has become increasingly important. 
This research aims to investigate the different ageing experiences of Japanese 
and Malaysian women and the activities they engaged in their "young old age". 
In-depth interviews were conducted to collect data and an adapted grounded 
theory approach was used for data analysis. Findings reveal many common 
characteristics for both groups of research participants. The emerging themes 
show that Japanese and Malaysian Chinese have different life missions evident in 
their daily activities, one passing on culture and the other passing on family 
values and life experience. They also differ in their choice of living 
arrangement (independent versus dependent/interdependent), attitudes to life 
(fighting versus accepting) and activities in which to engage (aesthetic 
pursuits versus family oriented activities).

The increase in life expectancy enhances phenomena such as second couplehood in 
old age following widowhood or divorce as an alternative way of coping with 
changes that occur with aging. Research on the phenomenon has focused mainly on 
individual and dyadic perspectives of the repartnered. The aim of this article 
was to explore repartnering from the stepfamily's perspective, which has 
scarcely been studied. Nineteen Israeli stepfamilies (38 multigenerational 
families) were recruited using criterion sampling, of men who repartnered at age 
65+ and women at 60+, with children and grandchildren from a lifelong marriage 
that ended in widowhood or divorce. We audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim 
107 semi-structured, qualitative interviews with older partners, their adult 
children, and grandchildren. Analysis was based on grounded theory and dyadic 
analysis principles adapted to families. It showed how repartnering in old age 
changed the family structure, constructing complex stepfamilies, which require 
further study. Emotional experiences refer to repartnering being a replacement 
for couplehood but not for parenthood/grandparenthood. Practical consequences 
refer to "knowing their place" within the stepfamily and included the following 
subthemes: showing affection; participating in memorials for the deceased 
spouse; sharing, listening, and assisting. Findings are discussed regarding life 
course and family life cycle perspectives.

Since the late 1980s, the concept of 'successful ageing' has set the frame for 
discourse about contemporary ageing research. Through an analysis of the 
reception to John W. Rowe and Robert L. Kahn's launch of the concept of 
'successful ageing' in 1987, this article maps out the important themes and 
discussions that have emerged from the interdisciplinary field of ageing 
research. These include an emphasis on interdisciplinarity; the interaction 
between biology, psycho-social contexts and lifestyle choices; the experiences 
of elderly people; life-course perspectives; optimisation and prevention 
strategies; and the importance of individual, societal and scientific 
conceptualisations and understandings of ageing. By presenting an account of the 
recent historical uses, interpretations and critiques of the concept, the 
article unfolds the practical and normative complexities of 'successful ageing'.

BACKGROUND: Primary androgen deprivation therapy (pADT) is commonly used to 
treat elderly men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (CaP), despite the 
lack of evidence supporting its use.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of pADT on mortality and to assess contemporary 
trends of pADT use in elderly men with CaP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Men older than 65 yr residing in 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry areas diagnosed with 
localized or locally advanced CaP between 1992 and 2009 and not receiving 
definitive therapy.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Propensity score (PS)-weighted 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effect of pADT use on 
overall survival among patients receiving pADT. The interaction between 
comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (LE) and pADT use was assessed within the 
Cox and PS-weighted models. Contemporary (2004-2009) trends for pADT use were 
analyzed by linear regression.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The primary cohort included 46 376 men, of whom 17 873 
received pADT (39%). Patients with >10 yr LE had lower pADT utilization rates 
than patients with short LE. Between 2004 and 2009, the use of pADT in men with 
localized CaP decreased by 14% (from 36% to 22%). Relative to observation, pADT 
was associated with a survival disadvantage, with a hazard ratio for all-cause 
mortality of 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.20-1.56). Limitations included 
biases not accounted for by the PS-weighted model, changes in CaP staging over 
the study period, the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) data prior to 
2004, and the limits of retrospective analysis to demonstrate causality.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of pADT in elderly men with localized CaP has decreased 
over time. For men forgoing primary definitive therapy, the use of pADT is not 
associated with a survival benefit compared to observation, and denies men an 
opportunity for cure with definitive therapy. The deleterious effect of pADT is 
most pronounced in men with prolonged LE.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we assessed the effect of primary androgen 
deprivation (pADT) on prostate cancer mortality and determined current trends in 
the use of pADT. We showed that use of pADT in men aged >65 yr with localized 
prostate cancer has decreased over time. We also found that pADT is detrimental 
to men with localized prostate cancer, and particularly men with longer life 
expectancy. Therefore, we conclude that ADT should not be used as a primary 
treatment for men with prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate.

Although the 4 million+people in the U.S. with an intellectual or developmental 
disability (I/DD) experience the same life expectancy as those in the general 
population, end-of-life research including these individuals is lacking and can 
be difficult to implement. As will be described in this paper, it is possible to 
overcome barriers to successfully include people with I/DD in end-of-life 
research. In this paper, the implementation challenges, feasibility, and 
implications for successful end-of-life research with individuals with I/DD 
using focus groups are described. Individuals with I/DD were able to discuss 
their experiences and views about end-of-life care. However, while people with 
I/DD made valuable contributions to the focus groups, there were several 
modifications needed in order to execute this study. In order to gain a complete 
picture of end-of-life care for people with I/DD, it is imperative to include 
them in research to the best of their ability. By anticipating issues related to 
recruitment, the consent process, setting, and support needs of participants, 
focus groups can be successfully implemented.

INTRODUCTION: The recent evolution of prosthesis technology has enabled the 
surgeon to replace entire limbs. These special prostheses, or megaprostheses, 
were developed for the treatment of severe oncological bone loss; however, the 
indications and applications of these devices have expanded to other orthopaedic 
and trauma situations. For some years, surgeons have been implanting 
megaprostheses in non-oncological conditions, such as acute trauma in severe 
bone loss and poor bone quality; post-traumatic failures, both aseptic and 
septic (represented by complex non-unions and critical size bone defects); major 
bone loss in prosthetic revision, both aseptic and septic; periprosthetic 
fractures with component mobilisation and poor bone stock condition. The purpose 
of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the complications during and after 
the implantation of megaprosthesis of the lower limb in post-traumatic and 
prosthetic bone loss, and to propose tips about how to avoid and manage such 
complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the complications and difficulties we have 
encountered during or after the implantation of megaprosthesis in non-oncology 
patients were evaluated retrospectively. A total of 72 patients were treated 
with large resection mono-and bi-articular prostheses between January 2008 and 
January 2014.
RESULTS: The main critical problems found in the study were: restoration of the 
correct length and rotation of the limb; reconstruction of the knee extensor 
mechanism; trochanteric reconstruction; stability/dislocation of the implant; 
mobility/range of motion (ROM) of the implant; skin cover; sepsis, and bone 
quality.
CONCLUSION: Megaprosthesis in severe bone loss can be considered as an available 
solution for the orthopaedic surgeon in extreme, appropriately selected cases. 
This type of complex surgery must be performed in specialised centres where 
knowledge and technologies are present. Patients with severe bone loss should 
not be treated in the same way as oncology patients because life expectancy is 
definitely longer; therefore, the surgical technique and the system implantation 
must be extremely rigorous to ensure longevity of the prosthesis. The 
characteristics of the bone and soft tissue conditions in these patients are 
very different from those presented by oncology patients, which creates critical 
problems that the surgeon should be able to manage to avoid serious 
complications.

OBJECTIVE: The role of endovascular repair (EVAR) of aortic aneurysms in young 
patients is controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the 
long-term outcomes and reintervention rates in patients 60 years of age or 
younger who underwent elective open or endovascular repair of an abdominal 
aortic aneurysm.
METHODS: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected vascular surgery 
database at a university-affiliated medical center was performed to identify all 
patients who underwent elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm between 
2000 and 2013 and were 60 years of age or younger at the time of the repair. 
Preoperative anatomic measurements were performed and compared with instructions 
for use (IFU) criteria for the endografts.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 169 patients 60 years of age or younger 
(mean age, 56.7 ± 2.8 years) who underwent elective repair (119 open repair, 50 
EVAR). Patients treated with open repair and EVAR had similar comorbidities, 
except that EVAR patients were more likely to have hypertension (P = .03) and 
poor left ventricular function (P = .04). The open repair group had 
significantly larger suprarenal (P = .004) and infrarenal (P = .005) neck 
angles, shorter neck lengths (P < .001), and larger maximum aneurysm diameter (P 
= .02) compared with the EVAR group. Only five patients (13%) in the EVAR group 
did not meet all IFU criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.8% 
(0% EVAR, 2.5% open repair; P = .56). Overall mean life expectancy was 11.5 
years (9.8 years EVAR, 11.9 years open repair; P = .09). The 1-year (98% EVAR, 
96% open repair), 5-year (86% EVAR, 88% open repair), and 10-year (54% EVAR, 75% 
open repair) survival did not differ between EVAR and open repair (P = .16). 
Long-term survival (78% EVAR, 85% open repair; P = .09) and reintervention rates 
(12% EVAR, 16% open repair; P = .80) did not differ. No late aneurysm rupture or 
aneurysm-related deaths were observed. The most common causes of long-term 
mortality were malignant disease and cardiovascular events. Reinterventions in 
the open repair group were exclusively laparotomy related (incisional hernia 
repairs), whereas all reinterventions in the EVAR group were aortic related, 
including one conversion to open repair.
CONCLUSIONS: After elective aneurysm repair, younger patients have a moderate 
life expectancy related to malignant disease and cardiovascular health. EVAR 
offers durability and long-term survival similar to those with open repair in 
these younger patients as long as aneurysm anatomy and IFU are adhered to.

Tree shrew has increasingly become an attractive experimental animal model for 
human diseases, particularly for breast cancer due to spontaneous breast tumours 
and their close relationship to primates and by extension to humans. However, 
neither normal mammary glands nor breast tumours have been well characterised in 
the Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis). In this study, normal 
mammary glands from four different developmental stages and 18 spontaneous 
breast tumours were analysed. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that normal mammary gland morphology and 
structures of tree shrews were quite similar to those found in humans. 
Spontaneous breast tumours of tree shrews were identified as being intraductal 
papilloma, papillary carcinoma, and invasive ductal carcinoma with or without 
lung metastasis. To further analyse breast cancer tumours among tree shrews, 40 
3-4 month-old female tree shrews were orally administrated 20 mg 
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) or peanut oil thrice, and then, 15 of 
these DMBA administrated tree shrews were implanted with medroxyprogesterone 
acetate (MPA) pellets. DMBA was shown to induce breast tumours (12%) while the 
addition of MPA increased the tumour incidence (50%). Of these, three induced 
breast tumours were intraductal papillary carcinomas and one was invasive ductal 
carcinoma (IDC). The PTEN/PIK3CA (phosphatase and tensin 
homologue/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit 
alpha), but not TP53 and GATA3, genes are frequently mutated in breast tumours, 
and the PTEN/PIK3CA gene mutation status correlated with the expression of pAKT 
in tree shrew breast tumours. These results suggest that tree shrews may be a 
promising animal model for a subset of human breast cancers with PTEN/PIK3CA 
gene mutations.

BACKGROUND: The increasing life expectancy of older adults has prompted an 
increase in chronic conditions that may interfere with their daily living and 
impact physical and mental health.
OBJECTIVES: This study examined associations between commonly reported chronic 
conditions, daily functioning, self-assessed health, and depressive symptoms of 
elders.
METHODS/DESIGN: A secondary analysis of existing data from 314 elderly residents 
of 29 facilities was conducted.
RESULTS: The most frequently reported conditions were arthritis (64%), 
hypertension (47%), and heart problems (35%). Elders who reported having all 
three of these most frequently reported conditions differed significantly from 
those who reported none or one of the three conditions (p<.001) on their 
perception of interference with daily functioning and self-assessed health. 
Although differences on depressive symptoms were found between groups defined by 
number and combinations of conditions, specific trends in the data were not 
detected. Elder's rating of interference of their chronic conditions on daily 
functioning was moderately associated with their self-assessed health (r=-.50, 
p<.001) and depressive symptoms (r=.41, p<.001).
CONCLUSION: While chronic conditions may be unavoidable, assessing their 
comorbidity in elders is important for developing interventions to preserve 
their daily functioning and promote their optimal health.

Agaricus subrufescens is a cultivated edible and medicinal mushroom. Its known 
geographical distribution encompasses the Americas, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. 
The objective of this study was to assess mating compatibility and 
interfertility of strains originating from Brazil, France, and Thailand. Progeny 
of each strain were analyed with codominant molecular markers. Multilocus 
genotype tests revealed that the three strains were amphithallic with 
percentages of heterokaryotic single spore progenies of 75% for the Thai strain 
and around 40% for the Brazilian and French strains. In mating tests A. 
subrufescens had a multiallelic unifactorial system of sexual incompatibility. 
The three parent strains were interfertile based on experimental pairings of 
single-spore isolates, the recovery of hybrid heterokaryons from compatible 
matings, and the ability of hybrids to produce mushrooms and fertile spores. 
This biological approach supports the inclusion of the European strains within 
the species and the extension of the geographical distribution range to Asia. 
Our data should help to develop breeding strategies and to better manage and 
exploit the diversity existing in A. subrufescens.
