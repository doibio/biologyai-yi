The United States is characterised by a structural populism problem that 
persists even without Trump as president. Its economic policy is fundamentally 
contradictory. The US fiscal and deficit policy under Trump was considered risky 
even before the corona shock, while the aggressive US trade policy is a 
self-inflicted wound. If we look at effective lifetime income, Germany, France 
and the United States are on an equal footing. This is due in part to the lag in 
life expectancy in the US and the much higher health care costs - relative to 
GDP - in the American system. A transatlantic dialogue on reform would be 
worthwhile after the corona shock of 2020.

US-Präsident Donald Trump hat am 3. November 2020 zwar eine Niederlage erfahren, 
dennoch könnte der seit 2016 politisch in den USA herrschende Populismus als 
Mischung aus neuem Nationalismus und Protektionismus für einige Jahre andauern. 
Die US-Wahlen fanden unter besonderen Bedingungen statt: so löste der 
Corona-Schock einen weltweiten Wirtschaftsschock aus.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is considered as one of 
the leading causes of liver disease in thalassemic patients in Iran. Over 40% of 
the mortality in these patients is related to HCV.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed at estimating HCV prevalence in thalassemic 
patients in Iran and to determine the number of infections until eradication is 
achieved.
METHODS: A meta-analysis approach was used to estimate the number of 
HCV-infected thalassemic patients in the country. The prevalence rate was 
measured using a modeling approach to predict the number of cases until 
eradication using several scenarios in terms of testing and treatment, in 
particular the use of direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs).
RESULTS: With the advent of DAAs with a high rate of treatment success, HCV 
could be eradicated earlier than originally thought among this group of 
patients. Based on previous predictions the number of HCV-infected thalassemic 
patients would have been below 66 by 2020. However, according to our 
predictions, the number will be less than 10 when using DAAs.
CONCLUSION: We believe that HCV eradication can be achieved in thalassemic 
patients with an increased life expectancy by funding DAA-based new treatment 
strategies. This has been exemplified in Alborz, Lorestan, and South Khorasan 
provinces with HCV eradication in this group of patients.

HTA and economics in the United States: a systematic review of ICER reports to 
evaluate trends, identify factors associated with recommendations, and 
understand implications.

BACKGROUND: The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is a prominent 
health technology assessment (HTA) entity in the United States that considers 
costs and applies economic analyses to derive price-based recommendations. ICER 
continues to adjust its value framework, yet discussion persists regarding 
whether ICER methodologies align with established research standards. This work 
evaluates ICER assessments relative to those standards, providing a benchmark 
with the release of ICER's most recent value framework update. OBJECTIVES: To 
evaluate ICER economic assessments for trends, factors related to 
recommendations, and quality for use in U.S. decision making. METHODS: We 
evaluated all ICER final evidence reports published between 2006 and August 31, 
2019, with regard to base-case result trends over time, pricing sources, 
comparator selection, analytic perspectives, model uncertainty, how modeling 
results aligned with ICER's determinations of value for money, and comparison of 
ICER methodological approaches with established modeling standards. Analyses 
were stratified by time period, where appropriate, to account for changes in 
ICER's framework over time. RESULTS: Of 58 ICER final evidence reports, 47 used 
the most commonly reported outcome (cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); 
ICER-developed models evaluated 131 interventions and comparators with 238 
base-case results. Pricing sources for ICER reports became more standardized in 
2017, although sources were not associated with the likelihood of falling below 
ICER's cost-effectiveness thresholds. In 30% of base-case analyses (n = 72), 
ICER did not use a clinical comparator, although reasonable treatments were 
available. In modified societal perspectives scenarios applied in later 
assessments, 75% of analyses (n = 76) included productivity but did not specify 
how it was quantified. Reports did not explain how sensitivity and scenario 
analyses were selected or implications of results. ICER value for money 
determinations generally aligned with cost-effectiveness results, although 2 of 
33 (6%) interventions ranked as low value and 3 of 5 (60%) interventions ranked 
as low-moderate value, met a $150,000 per QALY threshold, and 14 of 37 (38%) 
moderate-value interventions exceeded this threshold; the most common rationale 
was related to national budget impact. CONCLUSIONS: While some progress has been 
made, further improvement is needed to ensure that ICER assessments address the 
most relevant questions for target audiences, adhere to established research 
standards, and are reported in a manner that can be readily interpreted and 
applied to policymaking. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

PURPOSE: The life expectancy for people with spina bifida has increased, thus 
resulting in greater need for guidelines in urologic care in order to protect 
normal renal function, to develop strategies for urinary continence, and to 
advance independence through adult years.
METHODS: The English literature was assessed from 2002-2015; greater than 300 
publications identified. Case reports and opinion pieces were eliminated leaving 
100 for in depth review. Clinical questions were then established for each age 
group that allowed for focused assessment.
RESULTS: There was no Level 1 evidence for any of the defined clinical 
questions. This resulted in group consensus for all questions throughout all age 
groups. Guidelines were provided for identifying a symptomatic urinary 
infection, the role of urodynamic bladder testing and identification of bladder 
hostility, determining methods of renal function assessment and surveillance, 
the initiation of continence control, and transitioning to self-care through the 
teen and adult years.
CONCLUSION: Urologic guidelines continue to be based on clinical consensus due 
to the lack of high level evidence-based research. Further research is required 
in all aspects of urologic management. While not the "Standard of Care," these 
guidelines should be considered "Best Practice".

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and SARS-CoV-2: A scoping review.

Panigrahy N, Policarpio J, Ramanathan R.

Erratum in
    J Pediatr Rehabil Med. 2021;14(1):137.

PURPOSE: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 43 million people resulting in over 1 million 
deaths. Approximately 2% of cases in the United States are children, and in most 
cases the child is either asymptomatic or has mild symptoms. However, some 
pediatric cases can present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). 
Understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and management of MIS-C 
related to SARS-CoV-2 will help to streamline early diagnosis and treatment, 
particularly in pediatric patients with complex medical conditions.
METHODS: This scoping review adopted methods from the Joanna Briggs Institute 
(JBI) manual for evidence synthesis and preferred reporting items for systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. 
Primary studies of patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) criteria for MIS-C from December 31st, 2019 to Oct 5th, 2020 
were identified using PubMed and Scopus. Articles were screened for eligibility, 
and data collection was conducted on those fulfilling inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Of 417 studies identified, 57 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 
875 patients from 15 countries. Globally, 57% of children affected with MIS-C 
were males. The median age was 9 years old, ranging from 6 months to 21 years. 
Forty-five percent of the patients had underlying comorbidities including 
obesity and lung disease. Fever, conjunctivitis and GI symptoms were common. 
Most MIS-C patients had high biomarkers including troponin I, N-terminal 
prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBCs), 
interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, and ferritin. The treatment for most 
patients included IVIG and inotropic support.
CONCLUSION: MIS-C can be a unique and potentially life-threatening manifestation 
of SARS-CoV-2 in children and often requires medical intervention.

AIMS: With the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of 
prostate cancer and its use in targeted prostate biopsy, an increased incidence 
of anterior-predominant prostate cancer (APC) has been observed.
METHODS: We enrolled 200 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our 
department between 12/2017 and 04/2019. We evaluated tumour location in the 
individual segments of the prostate, index tumour location and volume, and 
compared the postoperative stage, Gleason score, grade group (GG), and the 
presence of extraprostatic extension (EPE) in APC and posterior prostate cancer 
(PPC). We assessed the rate of MRI scans prior to prostate surgery as well as 
the influence of family history and PSA on the presence of APC.
RESULTS: We found a significantly higher rate of anterior tumours than 
previously reported (37%) and confirmed that these tumours are diagnosed with a 
significantly larger index tumour volume (P=0.003). We also showed that a mere 
6.76% of APCs were low-risk tumours not requiring radical treatment. 
Furthermore, anterior tumours were found significantly more often (P=0.001) in 
patients who underwent preoperative MRI. No differences were observed between 
PSA values, family history, presence of EPE, or locally advanced disease in APC 
vs. PPC.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of anterior tumours is higher than previously 
thought, and they include tumours requiring radical treatment. When these 
tumours are neglected, it may lead to patient undertreatment with impact on 
their life prognosis. Thus, we consider the use of MRI-targeted prostate biopsy 
to be a necessity both for ruling out APC in the case of repeatedly negative 
prostate biopsies and, in particular, before patient inclusion in active 
surveillance.

HIV-Positive Patients Are at Increased Risk of Venous Thromboembolism After 
Total Joint Replacement.

Orthopaedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital (Schwab and Lange), Department 
of Orthopaedic Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Jackson and 
Abdeen), and Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital 
(Bedair), Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has improved the life expectancy of HIV 
patients, leading to an increase in total joint replacement for age-related 
osteoarthritis. HIV patients are inherently hypercoagulable at baseline. The 
goal of our study was to compare the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
in HIV patients with HIV-negative controls after total joint replacement.
METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 110 HIV patients (85 hips 
and 25 knees) and 240 HIV-negative controls (180 hips and 85 knees) between 2000 
and 2018. Prophylactic anticoagulation was used in 98% of patients 
postoperatively-low-molecular weight heparin (73%), warfarin (19%), aspirin 
(6%), and clopidogrel (1%).
RESULTS: The VTE rate was 3.6% in the HIV-positive group (2.5% total hip 
arthroplasty [THA] and 8.0% total knee arthroplasty [TKA]) and 0.4% in the 
control group (0% THA and 1.7% TKA). VTEs occurred at the median (interquartile 
range) time of 40 days (1 to 52) post-op in the HIV group and 3 days post-op in 
the one control. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sex, smoking, 
history of VTE, and joint replaced identified HIV as an independent predictor of 
VTE (odds ratio 10.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 114.0, P = 0.046). All 
patients with VTE were treated with warfarin (5 to 9 months); two cases were 
complicated by hemarthrosis and excessive bleeding at the insulin injection 
site.
CONCLUSION: We observed increased rates of symptomatic VTE in HIV patients after 
THA (2.5%) and TKA (8%) compared with HIV-negative control patients (0% and 
1.7%, respectively). HIV positivity was identified as an independent predictor 
of perioperative VTE. Our data suggests that HIV patients may be at higher risk 
for post-op VTE than HIV-negative patients. Surgeons may want to consider the 
use of more potent anticoagulation (ie, warfarin or novel anticoagulants) for a 
longer duration in HIV-positive patients. However, further studies are necessary 
to form evidence-based guidelines regarding this practice.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prognostic.

Background:Although evaluations of breast cancer screening programs frequently 
estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses by stage, other breast cancer 
characteristics influence treatment and vary by mode of detection - i.e. whether 
the cancer is detected through screening (screen-detected), between screening 
rounds (interval-detected) or outside screening (community-detected). Here, we 
estimate the association between early-stage invasive breast cancer (ESIBC) 
characteristics and treatment-related QALY losses.Methods:Using 
clinicopathological and treatment information from 675 women managed for ESIBC, 
we estimated the average five-year treatment-related QALY loss by detection 
group. We then used regression analysis to estimate the extent to which known 
cancer characteristics and the detection mode, are associated with treatment and 
treatment-related QALY losses.Results:Community-detected cancers had the largest 
QALY loss (0.76 QALYs [95% CI 0.73;0.80]), followed by interval-detected cancers 
(0.75 QALYs [95% CI 0.68;0.82]) and screen-detected cancers (0.69 QALYs [95%CI 
0.67;0.71]). Adverse prognostic factors more common in community-detected and 
interval-detected breast cancers (large tumours, lymph node involvement, high 
grade) were largely associated with QALY losses from mastectomies and 
chemotherapy. Receptor-positive subtypes, more common in screen-detected 
cancers, were associated with QALY losses related to endocrine 
therapy.Conclusions:The associations between ESIBC characteristics and 
treatment-related QALY losses should be considered when evaluating breast cancer 
screening and treatment strategies.

Spissistilus festinus (Say) (Hemiptera: Membracidae) was shown to transmit 
Grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV) in a greenhouse study. Grapevines infected 
with GRBV exhibit reduced sugar accumulation, altered secondary metabolite 
production and delayed berry maturation that negatively impacts wine quality and 
economics. Augmentative biocontrol may be a useful integrated pest management 
(IPM) tool for suppressing S. festinus populations in vineyards, but minimal 
research has been conducted on testing potential predators against the different 
life stages of S. festinus. The susceptibility of S. festinus adults and nymphs 
(1st through 5th instar) to predation by six commercially available biocontrol 
agents in petri dish and bell bean plant arenas was determined under greenhouse 
conditions. No significant mortality of S. festinus nymphs or adults occurred 
when exposed to Cryptolaemus montrouzieri adults, C. montrouzieri larvae and 
Sympherobius barberi adults in petri dish or bell bean plant arenas. Significant 
mortality of 1st and 2nd instar nymphs of S. festinus in the presence of Zelus 
renardii nymphs was observed in petri dish but not in bell bean arenas. 
Hippodamia convergens adults and Chrysoperla rufilabris larvae both consumed a 
significant number of S. festinus nymphs in petri dish and bell bean arenas. No 
significant predation of S. festinus adults was documented in this experiment. 
Results of this study aid in identifying predators that may be suitable 
candidates for additional field testing to determine their potential efficacy as 
biocontrol agents of S. festinus in a vineyard setting.

Healers Need Healing Too: Results from the Good Road of Life Training.

Kelley A, Small C.

Mental health professionals that work with American Indian and Alaska Native 
(AI/AN) populations are often viewed as ineffective because their professional 
training is based on a Western model of service delivery that is an extension of 
Western colonization. Research on effective training approaches for AI/AN mental 
health providers or mental health professionals that work with AI/AN populations 
is limited. The purpose of this study is to document the experiences and impact 
of the Good Road of Life (GRL) training on mental health professionals that work 
with AI/AN populations. A cross sectional mixed-methods design was used to 
answer the primary research question, "What is the impact of GRL training on 
mental health professionals who work in American Indian communities?" We used 
GRL ratings, self-reported impacts, knowledge gains, and pre-post Sources of 
Strength scores. Self-reported mean knowledge scores increased for all topics. 
Daily evaluations indicate that most participants felt more positive, knew more 
about the impacts of sobriety, and knew how to help a suicidal person. Sources 
of Strength mean scores increased in the following areas: confidence, belonging, 
historical trauma, using strengths to overcome difficulties, spiritual 
practices, resolved unhealthy relationships, and use of cultural resilience. 
Results indicate that GRL is an effective short-term training for professionals 
working in the mental health field throughout Indian Country.

CONTEXT: Patient prognostic understanding is improved by oncologists' 
discussions of life expectancy. Most patients deem it important to discuss 
prognosis with their oncologists, but a minority of cancer patients within 
months of death report that they had such a discussion with their oncologist.
OBJECTIVES: To query stakeholders about their perspectives on the clinical 
approach and utility of an Oncolo-GIST manualized communication intervention, 
designed to enhance oncologists' ability to convey the gist of prognostic 
information simply, clearly, and effectively in the setting of progressing solid 
tumors and limited life expectancy.
METHODS: We obtained and analyzed feedback on the intervention from solid tumor 
oncology clinicians and bereaved family caregivers, soliciting opinions on the 
clinical approach taken in the videos, acceptability and likely impact of the 
instructions, and specific phrases recommended in the manual.
RESULTS: Twenty stakeholders (9 clinicians, 11 caregivers) participated. All 
agreed that oncologists should broach prognosis with patients, balancing honesty 
and sensitivity. Participants also advocated for oncologists to involve 
interprofessional team members (e.g., nurses, social workers) when serious 
mental health concerns arose. After the research team's discussion of the 
stakeholder feedback, the manual was modified to include or exclude preferred 
language and approaches.
CONCLUSION: The Oncolo-GIST intervention was characterized as simple and 
potentially effective at conveying prognoses to advanced cancer patients. Future 
research should determine if this approach to medical communication, which 
distills the essence of prognostic messages clearly and simply, is associated 
with improvements in patients' prognostic understanding.

OBJECTIVES: Some degree of mental distress is commonly present in old age, and 
it is often exacerbated in later life following changes in physical health. This 
work presents in 2 studies among samples that have been exposed to stressful 
experiences in the past, a prospective examination of how the association 
between physical health and mental distress is attenuated by 2 forms of views on 
aging, evaluations of age, and evaluations of one's future.
METHOD: Study 1 (N = 226) was conducted in 2008 (Time 1) and 2014 (Time 2), 
among Israeli war veterans (mean age 64.90, SD = 5.04); Study 2 (N = 132) was 
conducted in 2014 (Time 1) and 2015 (Time 2) among older adults who were exposed 
to ongoing rocket fire in the south of Israel (mean age 66.44, SD = 9.77). 
Participants reported on their subjective age, subjective life expectancy (SLE 
[in Study 1]/distance to death [DtD; in Study 2]), health, and mental distress.
RESULTS: Both studies showed that after controlling for exposure to trauma and 
for Time 1 mental distress, Time 1 subjective age, but not SLE/DtD, moderated 
the association between Time 1 physical health and Time 2 mental distress.
DISCUSSION: Subjective age and SLE represent distinct features of views of 
aging. Subjective age may reflect perceptions of one's aging process, associated 
more directly with health-related outcomes over time. SLE reflects future, 
death-related perceptions, therefore perhaps less directly associated with such 
outcomes.

AIM: Neurostimulation techniques are effective treatments for major depressive 
disorders (MDD). However, the optimal sequence of electroconvulsive therapy 
(ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as part of antidepressant 
treatment algorithm is unclear. We examined the cost-effectiveness of ECT and 
TMS in MDD.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine total costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) for 10 strategies. Each strategy comprised four treatment lines with ECT 
and TMS incorporated as second, third, or fourth line. A scenario analysis that 
explored the cost-effectiveness of maintenance approach by continuing ECT and 
TMS after acute treatment was performed.
RESULTS: In the base case, fourth-line TMS after three preceding trials of 
antidepressants was least costly at US$ 5523 yielding 1.424 QALYs. Compared with 
this strategy, fourth-line ECT and third-line TMS followed by ECT were 
cost-effective with ICERs of US$ 7601 per QALY gained and US$ 11 388 per QALY 
gained, respectively. In the scenario analysis where continuation treatments of 
ECT and TMS were provided, third-line TMS followed by ECT was cost-effective, 
with an ICER of US$ 17 198 per QALY gained. Effectiveness of ECT and cost of 
managing severe depression were influential parameters affecting the 
cost-effectiveness results.
CONCLUSIONS: In acute treatment of MDD, fourth-line ECT was the most 
cost-effective strategy. In maintenance treatment, the strategy that 
incorporated third-line TMS and fourth-line ECT was cost-effective. The overall 
findings confirmed the value of neurostimulation therapies which should be 
offered early in the process of managing depression.

Life expectancy has risen in the past decades, resulting in an increase in the 
number of aged individuals. Exercise remains one of the most cost-effective 
treatments against disease and the physical consequences of aging. The purpose 
of this research was to investigate the effects of aging, long-term and lifelong 
exercise on the rat urinary metabolome. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided 
into four equal groups: exercise from 3 to 12 months of age (A), lifelong 
exercise from 3 to 21 months of age (B), no exercise (C), and exercise from 12 
to 21 months of age (D). Exercise consisted in swimming for 20 min/day, 5 
days/week. Urine samples collection was performed at 3, 12 and 21 months of life 
and their analysis was conducted by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
Multivariate analysis of the metabolite data did not show any discrimination 
between groups at any of the three aforementioned ages. However, multivariate 
analysis discriminated the three ages clearly when the groups were treated as 
one. Univariate analysis showed that training increased the levels of urinary 
amino acids and possibly protected against sarcopenia, as evidenced by the 
higher levels of creatine in the exercising groups. Aging was accompanied by 
decreased levels of urinary amino acids and signs of increased glycolysis. 
Concluding, both aging and, to a lesser degree, exercise affected the rat 
urinary metabolome, including metabolites related to energy metabolism, with 
exercise showing a potential to mitigate the consequences of aging.

Fish is a very perishable food and therefore several storage strategies need to 
be employed to increase its shelf-life, guaranteeing its safety and quality from 
catch to consumption. Despite the advances in modern fish storage technologies, 
chilling and freezing are still the most common preservation methods used 
onboard. The present review aims to summarize strategies to increase the 
shelf-life of fresh (chilled) and frozen fish, as whole, gutted, or fillet, 
involving the assessment of different traditional cooling and freezing 
conditions of different fish species caught in different locations. Although 
there are other factors that influence the fish shelf-life, such as the fish 
species and the stress suffered during catch, storage time and temperature and 
the amount of ice are some of the most important. In addition, the way that fish 
is stored (whole, fillet, or gutted) also contributes to the final quality of 
the product. In most studies, whole chilled and frozen fish present longer 
shelf-life than those preserved as gutted and filleted. However, it should be 
noted that other factors related to the organism, capture method, and transport 
to the preparation/processing industry should be considered for shelf-life 
extension.

Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have a reduced life expectancy, 
which is largely the consequence of a high co-occurrence of cardiovascular 
diseases. To date, several intrinsic and environmental factors underlying this 
phenomenon have been found. However, the association with psychosocial stress 
has not been extensively addressed. In this study, we tested the relationship 
between a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), lifetime stressors, 
perceived stress and metabolic parameters in patients with schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders and in healthy controls. The participants included 85 
inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 56 healthy controls. Serum 
levels of glucose, insulin, low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL), 
triglycerides, total cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) 
were determined. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, patients 
had significantly higher levels of glucose (F = 4.856, p = 0.030), triglycerides 
(F = 4.720, p = 0.032) and hsCRP (F = 7.499, p = 0.007) as well as significantly 
lower levels of HDL (F = 5.300, p = 0.023) compared to healthy controls. There 
were also significant effects of interactions between diagnosis and a history of 
ACEs on the levels of insulin (F = 4.497, p = 0.036) and homeostatic model 
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (F = 3.987, p = 0.048). More 
specifically, the levels of insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the 
subgroup of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a positive 
history of ACEs compared to other subgroups of participants. No significant 
associations between lifetime stressors and perceived stress with metabolic 
parameters were found. Our findings indicate that a history of ACEs might be 
associated with insulin resistance in patients with schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders. Therapeutic strategies targeting early-life stress should be 
considered with early interventions that aim to manage cardiometabolic 
comorbidity in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only available vaccine for tuberculosis 
(TB), has been applied for decades. The Indonesian government recently 
introduced a national TB disease control programme that includes several action 
plans, notably enhanced vaccination coverage, which can be strengthened through 
underpinning its favourable cost-effectiveness. We designed a Markov model to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of Indonesia's current BCG vaccination programme. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated from the 
perspectives of both society and healthcare. The robustness of the analysis was 
confirmed through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Using 
epidemiological data compiled for Indonesia, BCG vaccination at a price US$14 
was estimated to be a cost-effective strategy in controlling TB disease. From 
societal and healthcare perspectives, ICERs were US$104 and US$112 per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively. The results were robust for 
variations of most variables in the univariate analysis. Notably, the vaccine's 
effectiveness regarding disease protection, vaccination costs, and case 
detection rates were key drivers for cost-effectiveness. The PSA results 
indicated that vaccination was cost-effective even at US$175 threshold in 95% of 
cases, approximating the monthly GDP per capita. Our findings suggest that this 
strategy was highly cost-effective and merits prioritization and extension 
within the national TB programme. Our results may be relevant for other high 
endemic low- and middle-income countries.

CONTEXT: Patients' personality traits can play an important role in the 
end-of-life care process.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between 
personality traits and dignity in cancer patients nearing death. In addition, 
the associations between personality traits and physical, psychological 
symptoms, and coping strategies during the end-of-life stage were explored.
METHODS: The study is cross-sectional. The sample consisted of 210 participants 
with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) lower than 50 and a life expectancy of 
a few weeks. For each patient, personal and clinical data were collected and a 
set of validated rating scales, assessing personality, dignity, physical, 
psychological symptoms and coping strategies was administered during the first 
psychological consultation.
RESULTS: The results highlighted significant associations between personality 
traits and dignity. In particular, Conscientiousness was negatively correlated 
with Social Support and Extroversion was negatively associated with Loss of 
Purpose and Meaning. Neuroticism was related to all the dimensions of dignity 
and Extroversion was significantly associated with the physical and 
psychological symptoms. Regarding coping styles, active coping strategies were 
predictors of Extroversion and Agreeableness. Conversely, anxiety symptoms 
predicted the Neuroticism trait.
CONCLUSIONS: Personality traits seem to be actively involved into the loss of 
dignity. These findings highlighted the importance of including personality 
traits and dignity into the patient's care process. Exploring individual 
differences and coping mechanisms at the end-of-life could improve palliative 
care and lead to better patient-tailored psychological interventions.

AIMS: Primary axillary hyperhidrosis (PAHH) is a condition characterized by 
excessive sweating that negatively impacts health-related quality of life, with 
significant psychological and social impacts. Glycopyrronium tosylate (GT) is a 
topical anticholinergic approved in the United States for treatment of PAHH in 
patients 9 years of age and older. Our objective was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of GT as first-line topical therapy compared to topical 
aluminum chloride from a United States commercial perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed consisting of four health 
states based on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) over a time 
horizon of 5 years with discount rates of 3% for both costs and outcomes. 
Transitions between health states were driven by HDSS response, defined as an 
improvement of ≥2 points. Non-responders and those who discontinue could switch 
to later line treatments or no treatment. Health utility scores were based on 
HDSS scores, supported by published literature.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, GT yielded 0.12 greater QALYs and 0.93 greater LYs with 
response compared to treatment with prescription aluminum chloride at an 
incremental cost of $10,584. Relative to prescription aluminum chloride, GT 
resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $87,238 per QALY 
gained, $11,349 per LY with response. The ICER fell below $100,000 for 66% of 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulations and below $150,000 for 82% of 
simulations.
LIMITATIONS: This analysis represents a simplified scenario of a hypothetical 
PAHH patient. Due to sparse data, assumptions were required for treatment 
patterns, efficacy, and persistence.
CONCLUSION: Based on the analysis of incremental cost per QALY gained, GT may be 
cost-effective relative to prescription aluminum chloride at commonly accepted 
willingness to pay thresholds.

BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on the expected long-term effects and 
cost-effectiveness of initiatives aiming to reduce the burden of obesity.
AIM: To develop a Norwegian obesity-focused disease-simulation model: the MOON 
model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model and simulated a Norwegian 
birth cohort's movement between the health states "normal 
weight,""overweight,""obese 1,""obese 2," and "dead" using a lifetime 
perspective. Model input was estimated using longitudinal data from health 
surveys and real-world data (RWD) from local and national registers (N = 
99,348). The model is deterministic and probabilistic and stratified by gender. 
Model validity was assessed by estimating the cohort's expected prevalence, 
health care costs, and mortality related to overweight and obesity.
RESULTS: Throughout the cohort's life, the prevalence of overweight increased 
steadily and stabilized at 45% at 45 y of age. The number of obese 1 and 2 
individuals peaked at age 75 y, when 44% of women and 35% of men were obese. The 
incremental costs per person associated with obesity was highest in older ages 
and, when accumulated over the lifetime, higher among women (€12,118, 
€9,495-€15,047) than men (€6,646, €5,252-€10,900). On average, obesity shortened 
the life expectancy of women/men in the whole cohort by 1.31/1.08 y. The life 
expectancy for normal-weight women/men at age 30 was 83.31/80.31. The life 
expectancy was reduced by 1.05/0.65 y if the individual was overweight, obese 
(2.87/2.71 y), or obese 2 (4.06/4.83 y).
CONCLUSION: The high expected prevalence of obesity in the future will lead to 
substantial health care costs and large losses in life-years. This underscores 
the need to implement interventions to reduce the burden of obesity; the MOON 
model will enable economic evaluations for a wide range of interventions.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, social differences in overweight and obesity (OWOB) 
have become more pronounced. Health impact assessments provide population-level 
scenario evaluations of changes in disease prevalence and risk factors. The 
objective of this study was to simulate the health effects of reducing the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity in populations with short and medium 
education.
METHODS: The DYNAMO-HIA tool was used to conduct a health inequality impact 
assessment of the future reduced disease prevalence (ischemic heart disease 
(IHD), diabetes, stroke, and multi-morbidity) and changes in life expectancy for 
the 2040-population of Copenhagen, Denmark (n = 742,130). We simulated an 
equalized weight scenario where the prevalence of OWOB in the population with 
short and medium education was reduced to the levels of the population with long 
education.
RESULTS: A higher proportion of the population with short and medium education 
were OWOB relative to the population with long education. They also had a higher 
prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases. In the equalized weight scenario, the 
prevalence of diabetes in the population with short education was reduced by 
8-10% for men and 12-13% for women. Life expectancy increased by one year among 
women with short education. Only small changes in prevalence and life expectancy 
related to stroke and IHD were observed.
CONCLUSION: Reducing the prevalence of OWOB in populations with short and medium 
education will reduce the future prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases, 
increase life expectancy, and reduce the social inequality in health. These 
simulations serve as reference points for public health debates.
