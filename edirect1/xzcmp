and 60.9% at EMMT and MMT clinics, respectively.The effect on EMMT retention was 
the same as that of MMT. Establishment of EMMT clinics was an effective strategy 
to expand the coverage of MMT and increase the retention of opiate dependents in 
the rural areas of the counties.

BACKGROUND: Limited trials examining the effect of exercise and nutrition 
supplementation in older people with sarcopenia are available.
OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of resistance exercise program targeting muscle 
strength and power with and without nutrition supplementation on gait speed, 
body composition, physical function and quality of life.
METHODS: this trial randomized 113 community-dwelling older Chinese adults aged 
≥65 and with sarcopenia defined using the Asian Criteria into one of the three 
groups: exercise program alone, combined-exercise program and nutrition 
supplement or waitlist control. The exercise program consisted of 90-min group 
training twice weekly and one-home session weekly for 12 weeks. Participants in 
the combined group were additionally asked to consume nutrition supplement twice 
daily for 12 weeks. Both groups were encouraged to keep home exercise after 
intervention period for another 12 weeks to detect sustained effect. The primary 
outcome was gait speed.
RESULTS: at 12 and 24 weeks, gait speed did not differ significantly between 
groups. Significant improvement in leg extension, and five-chair stand test 
occurred in both intervention groups that persisted to 24 weeks. Physical 
Activity Scale for the Elderly improved in both intervention groups that 
persisted until 24 weeks only in the combined group. Lower limb muscle and 
appendicular skeletal muscle mass increased significantly in the combined group 
but the increase was not sustained to 24 weeks.
CONCLUSION: the exercise program with and without nutrition supplementation had 
no significant effect on the primary outcome of gait speed but improved the 
secondary outcomes of strength and the five-chair stand test in 
community-dwelling Chinese sarcopenic older adults.

Mutations in the SOD1 gene are associated with some forms of familial 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). There are more than 150 different 
mutations in the SOD1 gene that have various effects on the copper-zinc 
superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme structure, including the loss of metal 
binding and a decrease in dimer affinity. The copper-based therapeutic CuATSM 
has been proven to be effective at rescuing neuronal cells from SOD1 mutant 
toxicity and has also increased the life expectancy of mice expressing the human 
transgenes SOD1G93A and SOD1G37R. Furthermore, CuATSM is currently the subject 
of a phase I/II clinical trial in Australia as a treatment for ALS. To determine 
if CuATSM protects against a broad variety of SOD1 mutations, we used a 
well-established cell culture model of SOD1-fALS. NSC-34 cells expressing 
SOD1-EGFP constructs were treated with CuATSM and examined by time-lapse 
microscopy. Our results show a concentration-dependent protection of cells 
expressing mutant SOD1A4V over the experimental time period. We tested the 
efficacy of CuATSM on 10 SOD1-fALS mutants and found that while protection was 
observed in cells expressing pathogenic wild-type-like mutants, cells expressing 
a truncation mutant or metal binding region mutants were not. We also show that 
CuATSM rescue is associated with an increase in human SOD1 activity and a 
decrease in the level of SOD1 aggregation in vitro. In conclusion, CuATSM has 
shown to be a promising therapeutic for SOD1-associated ALS; however, our in 
vitro results suggest that the protection afforded varies depending on the SOD1 
variant, including negligible protection to mutants with deficient copper 
binding.

Streptococcuspneumoniae is a major human pathogen at the extremes of age. The 
elderly are particularly vulnerable to S.pneumoniae, the most common causative 
agent of bacterial pneumonia in this population. Despite the availability of 
vaccines and antibiotics, mortality rates associated with pneumococcal pneumonia 
in this age group remain high. In light of globally increasing life-expectancy, 
a better understanding of the patho-mechanisms of elderly pneumococcal 
pneumonia, including alterations in innate immune responses, is needed to 
develop improved therapies. In this study we aimed at investigating how 
increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection relates to inflammation 
kinetics in the aged mouse pneumonia model by determining pulmonary cytokine and 
chemokine levels and comparing these parameters to those measured in young adult 
mice. Firstly, we detected overall higher pulmonary cytokine and chemokine 
levels in aged mice. However, upon induction of pneumococcal pneumonia in aged 
mice, delayed production of certain analytes, such as IFN-γ, MIG (CXCL9), IP-10 
(CXCL10), MCP-1 (CCL2), TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22) became apparent. In 
addition, aged mice were unable to control excess inflammatory responses: while 
young mice showed peak inflammatory responses at 20 h and subsequent resolution 
by 48 h post intranasal challenge, in aged mice increasing cytokine and 
chemokine levels were measured. These findings highlight the importance of 
considering multiple time points when delineating inflammatory responses to 
S.pneumoniae in an age-related context. Finally, correlation between pulmonary 
bacterial burden and cytokine or chemokine levels in young mice suggested that 
appropriately controlled inflammatory responses support the host to fight 
pneumococcal infection.

Do Health-Care Professionals Really Understand the Role of Occupational Therapy 
in Hospice Care?

Knecht-Sabres LJ(1), Weppner A(1), Powers C(1), Siesel B(1).

(1)1 Occupational Therapy Program, Midwestern University, Downers Grove, IL, 
USA.

BACKGROUND: The distinct value of occupational therapy (OT) in end-of-life care 
is to facilitate quality of life for clients and their caregivers through 
engagement in occupations during the clients' remaining days. The purpose of 
this study was to explore health-care professionals' perceptions and knowledge 
regarding the role of OT in hospice care and to better understand why OT may be 
underutilized in this setting.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 104 professionals working in hospice care from 31 
different states participated in this study.
METHODS: Electronic surveys were distributed to hospice agencies throughout the 
United States.
DATA ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics was used to analyze quantitative data, and 
content analysis was used to identify patterns with qualitative data. Rigor was 
enhanced through peer-review, multiple coders, and triangulation.
RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that OT's role in hospice care is 
misunderstood, and OT services are underutilized. Five themes were identified 
regarding the underutilization of OT services: (1) lack of reimbursement, (2) 
timing of referral, (3) knowledge of the role of OT, (4) refusal of services by 
family members, and (5) lack of OT presence in this setting.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that health-care professionals do believe that 
OTs are vital members of the hospice care team. However, many recipients of 
hospice care are not receiving OT. More consistent referrals to OT may better 
ensure that the terminally ill are able to attain end-of-life goals and live 
their lives to the fullest, regardless of life expectancy.

Due to the steady increase in life expectancy, the number of patients over 80 
years of age proposed for coronary angioplasty is increasing significantly. The 
elderly patient is a patient at high cardiovascular risk and high risk of 
bleeding; whose severity of prognosis depends of comorbidities. The radial 
approach presents particularities and technical difficulties that have to be 
known in this part of the population, but reduce vascular and hemorrhagic 
complications, as well as mortality. Because of greater safety, the radial 
approach is therefore the first choice for the elderly.

The power of citizen science to contribute to both science and society is 
gaining increased recognition, particularly in physics and biology. Although 
there is a long history of public engagement in agriculture and food science, 
the term 'citizen science' has rarely been applied to these efforts. Similarly, 
in the emerging field of citizen science, most new citizen science projects do 
not focus on food or agriculture. Here, we convened thought leaders from a broad 
range of fields related to citizen science, agriculture, and food science to 
highlight key opportunities for bridging these overlapping yet disconnected 
communities/fields and identify ways to leverage their respective strengths. 
Specifically, we show that (i) citizen science projects are addressing many 
grand challenges facing our food systems, as outlined by the United States 
National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as broader Sustainable 
Development Goals set by the United Nations Development Programme, (ii) there 
exist emerging opportunities and unique challenges for citizen science in 
agriculture/food research, and (iii) the greatest opportunities for the 
development of citizen science projects in agriculture and food science will be 
gained by using the existing infrastructure and tools of Extension programmes 
and through the engagement of urban communities. Further, we argue there is no 
better time to foster greater collaboration between these fields given the trend 
of shrinking Extension programmes, the increasing need to apply innovative 
solutions to address rising demands on agricultural systems, and the exponential 
growth of the field of citizen science.

INTRODUCTION: In Mexico, the prevalence of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) has 
increased in parallel with the increase in life expectancy. The E4 allele of the 
gene that encodes apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the main genetic risk factor for 
cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: To replicate the association of APOE-E4 allele with neurocognitive 
impairment in a Mexican population, as well as to implement a genetic 
risk-detection program with the APOE-E4 allele.
METHOD: A program was structured for the detection of APOE-E4 allele risk in 
different recruiting centers from the central zone of the Mexican Republic, with 
three stages: recruitment and selection of candidates for the detection of the 
risk-allele, genetic risk analysis and delivery of results.
RESULTS: In the genetic-association study to replicate the association with 
neurocognitive disorders by means of multivariate logistic models, the APOE-E4 
allele increased the risk for cognitive impairment in the Mexican populations by 
approximately 6 % (OR: 5.83, p = 0.0025). In addition, 367 genetic risk results 
were delivered.
CONCLUSIONS: The present program is the first one to be implemented in Mexico 
with the purpose to inform on a genetic risk factor for neurocognitive disorders 
in several centers of the country.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: En México, la prevalencia de los trastornos 
neurocognitivos (TNC) han aumentado a la par del incremento en la esperanza de 
vida. El alelo E4 del gen que codifica la apolipoproteína E (APOE) es el 
principal factor de riesgo genético para deterioro neurocognitivo.
OBJETIVO: Reproducir la asociación en población mexicana entre APOE-E4 y el 
deterioro neurocognitivo, así como implementar un programa de detección de 
riesgo genético con el alelo APOE-E4.
MÉTODO: Se estructuró un programa de detección de riesgo basado en APO-EA en 
diferentes centros de reclutamiento en la zona centro de la República Mexicana, 
con tres etapas: reclutamiento y selección de los candidatos para la detección 
del alelo de riesgo, análisis del riesgo genético y entrega del resultado.
RESULTADOS: El análisis de asociación genética para replicar la asociación con 
trastornos neurocognitivos mediante modelos logísticos multivariados mostró que 
el alelo E4 de APOE incrementó aproximadamente 6 % el riesgo en población 
mexicana (RM = 5.83, p = 0.0025). Se entregaron 367 resultados de riesgo 
genético.
CONCLUSIONES: El presente programa es el primero en México implementado para dar 
a conocer un factor de riesgo genético para trastornos neurocognitivos en varios 
centros del país.

Mortality and life expectancy forecast for (comparatively) high mortality 
countries.

241, Padua, 35121 Italy.

BACKGROUND: The Lee-Carter method and its later variants are widely accepted 
extrapolative methods for forecasting mortality and life expectancy in 
industrial countries due to their simplicity and availability of high quality 
long time series data.
OBJECTIVE: We compared and contrasted mortality forecasting models for higher 
mortality regimes that lack long time series data of good quality, which is 
common in several Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.
DATA AND METHODS: We utilized seven different variants of the Lee-Carter method 
and coherent mortality forecasts of various CEE countries, and the Bayesian 
Hierarchical Model used by the United Nations to produce probabilistic 
forecasts. The data of nine CEE countries with comparatively higher mortality 
have been considered.
RESULTS: The performance of the forecasting models for the nine CEE countries 
was found to be lower than that observed for low-mortality countries. No model 
gives uniquely best performance for all the nine CEE countries. Most of the LC 
variants produced lower forecasts of life expectancies than current life 
expectancy values for Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. A coherent mortality 
forecast could not overcome the limitations of single population forecasting 
techniques due to increasing mortality differences between these countries over 
the fitting period (mortality divergence). In the same context, the use of the 
probabilistic forecasting technique from the Bayesian framework resulted in a 
better forecast than some of the extrapolative methods but also produced a wider 
prediction interval for several countries. The more detailed analysis for 
Hungary indicates that a better fit of certain forecasting methods may occur in 
the later part of the life span rather than the whole life span.
CONCLUSION: These findings imply the necessity of inventing a new forecasting 
technique for high-mortality countries.

Convergence or Divergence? Life Expectancy Patterns in Post-communist Countries, 
1959-2010.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union experienced an unanticipated stagnation in the process of mortality 
reduction that was accelerating in the west. This was followed by even starker 
fluctuations and overall declines in life expectancy during the 1980s and 1990s. 
We identify statistically the extent to which, since the 1990s, the countries of 
the post-communist region have converged as a group towards other regional or 
cross-regional geopolitical blocks, or whether there are now multiple 
steady-states ('convergence clubs') emerging among these countries. We apply a 
complex convergence club methodology, including a recursive analysis, to data on 
30 OECD countries (including 11 post-communist countries) drawn from the Human 
Mortality Database and spanning the period 1959-2010. We find that, rather than 
converging uniformly on western life expectancy levels, the post-communist 
countries have diverged into multiple clubs, with the lowest seemingly stuck in 
low-level equilibria, while the best performers (e.g. Czech Republic) show signs 
of catching-up with the leading OECD countries. As the post-communist period has 
progressed, the group of transition countries themselves has become more 
heterogeneous and it is noticeable that distinctive gender and age patterns have 
emerged. We are the first to employ an empirical convergence club methodology to 
help understand the complex long-run patterns of life expectancy within the 
post-communist region, one of very few papers to situate such an analysis in the 
context of the OECD countries, and one of relatively few to interpret the 
dynamics over the long-term.

BACKGROUND: The link between age specific-rates of thyroid cancer (TC) and human 
development index (HDI) and also its components can be a new direction for 
planning by policy makers.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at identifying the relationship between TC rates by 
gender, and HDI and its components in different regions of the world.
METHODS: An ecological study was conducted; the data was obtained from the 
GLOBOCAN project in 2012. Inequality in TC estimates (age-specific incidence and 
mortality rates), according to the HDI and its components was calculated. 
Concentration index (CI) was used to estimate inequality and CI was decomposed 
to determine contribution of HDI and its components in inequality.
RESULTS: The inequality index (CI) was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.21 - 0.38) and -0.15 (95% 
CI: -0.23 - 0.06) for incidence and mortality of TC by HDI, respectively. The 
important contributors in inequality for incidence rates of TC were life 
expectancy at birth (0.30), mean years of schooling (0.26), and expected years 
of schooling (0.18). The important contributors in inequality of mortality rates 
were mean years of schooling (0.19), expected years of schooling (0.17), and 
urbanization (0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings of this study, global inequalities exist 
in the TC incidence and mortality rates; incidence rates of TC are more 
concentrated in countries with high HDI, yet inequality index showed that deaths 
occurred more in disadvantaged countries.

PURPOSE: Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDDs) are a heterogenous group of 
disorders characterized by intrinsic impairment in the immune system. Most 
patients with PIDD require life-long immunoglobulin G replacement therapy, which 
has been shown to reduce the rate of infections and, related hospitalizations 
and reduce health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Here, treatment satisfaction 
and HRQOL in patients with PIDD was evaluated upon switching from intravenous 
(IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulins (SCIGs) to 20% SCIG (Hizentra®), and 
during long-term steady-state Hizentra® treatment.
METHODS: Analyses were based on two pivotal (switch) and four 
extension/follow-up (maintenance) Phase III studies of Hizentra® conducted in 
Europe (EU), Japan (JP), and the United States (US). Two validated 
questionnaires were used: Life Quality Index (LQI) for assessment of 
IgG-specific perceptions of HRQOL and Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2).
RESULTS: In the EU and JP switch studies, there was significant and meaningful 
improvement from Screening in LQI domain scores at all time points, largely 
driven by patients switching from IVIG to SCIG. In the EU switch study, there 
were also significant increases in mean SF-36v2 domain scores for Physical 
Function and General Health from Screening to Week 12. These improvements were 
observed also at Week 24. Overall, LQI and SF-36v2 domain scores were generally 
sustained in the maintenance studies.
CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that switching patients from IVIG to SCIG 
improves patient self-reported health status and IgG-specific HRQOL perception. 
The maintenance studies generally showed no deterioration of this improved 
health status over a long follow-up period.

Dinutuximab Beta for Treating Neuroblastoma: An Evidence Review Group and 
Decision Support Unit Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.

As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (EUSA 
Pharma) of dinutuximab beta (Qarziba®) to submit evidence of its clinical and 
cost effectiveness for treating neuroblastoma. The BMJ Technology Assessment 
Group (BMJ-TAG) was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), 
reviewing the submission from the company. The Decision Support Unit (DSU) was 
commissioned to review additional evidence submitted by the company and to 
undertake further analyses. This article presents the critical review of the 
company's submissions by the ERG and DSU, further analyses undertaken by the 
DSU, and the outcome of the NICE guidance. The clinical effectiveness for 
dinutuximab beta was derived from a phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
that assessed the safety and efficacy of the addition of interleukin (IL)-2 to 
dinutuximab beta plus isotretinoin. This trial did not inform the relative 
effectiveness of dinutuximab beta versus isotretinoin alone, which was 
established practice in the UK for maintenance treatment. In the absence of 
direct evidence, the company initially conducted a naïve indirect treatment 
comparison against a historical control, and later performed a matching-adjusted 
indirect comparison (MAIC) against the isotretinoin arm of an RCT comparing 
dinutuximab alpha and isotretinoin. The company submitted a partitioned survival 
analysis model that calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of dinutuximab 
beta versus isotretinoin. The company's original incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was £22,338 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. However, 
the ERG were concerned that the company's ICER was not suitable for decision 
making, and thus carried out initial exploratory analysis as a first step to 
overcome the naïve estimation of treatment effectiveness in the model. The ERG's 
analysis estimated an ICER of £111,858 per QALY gained. In their revised 
analysis incorporating the MAIC and other changes as requested by the appraisal 
committee, the company's ICER was £24,661 per QALY gained. When the DSU 
incorporated longer-term isotretinoin data and made corrections to the model, 
the ICER increased to between £62,886 and £87,164 per QALY gained depending on 
the choice of survival model. A confidential Patient Access Scheme (PAS) 
decreased the ICERs. The ICERs with the PAS were over £40,000 per QALY gained, 
but the NICE committee additionally considered the patient population and its 
size, the disease severity, the potential for significant survival benefit and 
uncaptured health benefits, and recommended dinutuximab beta as a treatment 
option, subject to the company providing the agreed discount in the PAS.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cancer recurrence is observed in some patients without 
additional radical surgery after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) that 
does not fulfill the curability criteria for early gastric cancer (EGC), 
categorized as "noncurative resection" or "curability C-2" in the guidelines. 
However, time to cancer recurrence is different in such patients. Thus, we aimed 
to identify the risk factors of early and late cancer recurrences in these 
patients.
METHODS: Between 2000 and 2011, this multicenter study analyzed 905 patients who 
were followed up without additional radical surgery after ESD for EGC 
categorized as curability C-2. We evaluated the risk factors for early and late 
cancer recurrences, separately, after ESD. The cut-off value was defined at 2 
years.
RESULTS: Time to cancer recurrence in the enrolled patients showed a bimodal 
pattern, and the 5-year cancer recurrence rate was 3.2%. Multivariate Cox 
analyses revealed that lymphatic invasion (hazard ratio [HR], 8.56; P = .003) 
was the sole independent risk factor for early cancer recurrence. Regarding late 
cancer recurrence, vascular invasion (HR, 4.50; P = .039) was an independent 
risk factor, and lymphatic invasion tended to be a risk factor (HR, 3.63; P = 
.069).
CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study with a large cohort demonstrated that 
lymphatic invasion is mainly associated with early cancer recurrence; however, 
vascular invasion was a risk factor only for late recurrence in patients without 
additional treatment after ESD for EGC categorized as curability C-2. This 
finding may contribute to decision making for treatment strategies after ESD, 
especially for patients with a relatively short life expectancy.

PURPOSE: Endograft infection is an infrequent but one of the most serious and 
challenging complications after endovascular aortic repair. The aim of this 
study was to assess the management of this complication in a tertiary center.
CASE SERIES: A retrospective analysis of a prospective database was performed 
including all patients who underwent elective endovascular abdominal aortic 
repair (EVAR) from 2003 to 2016 in a tertiary center. Seven cases of endograft 
infection were identified during the follow-up period from a total of 473 
(1.48%) EVAR. Most frequent symptoms at presentation were fever (71.4%) and 
lumbar pain (57.1%). One case developed an early infection, while 6 cases were 
diagnosed as late infections. Mean time from endograft placement to symptom 
presentation was 28.3 months (2-91.5 months). Gram-positive cocci were the 
microorganisms most commonly isolated in blood cultures (66%). Two cases were 
managed with endograft removal and aortic reconstruction with a cryopreserved 
allograft, 2 cases with surgical drainage, and 2 cases exclusively with 
antibiotic therapy. In 1 case, the diagnosis was performed postoperatively based 
on intraoperative findings associated with positive graft cultures; and graft 
explantation was performed with "in situ" reconstruction using a Dacron graft. 
Perioperative mortality was 42.9%. One-year mortality was 57.1%. Mean follow-up 
was 21.5 months.
CONCLUSION: Endograft explantation is the gold standard of treatment; however, 
given the overall high morbi-mortality rates of this pathology, a tailored 
approach should always be offered depending on the patient's overall condition. 
Conservative management can be an acceptable option in those patients with short 
life expectancy and high surgical risk.

BACKGROUND: The total health expenditure (as a percentage of GDP) and health 
outcomes in the region of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) and Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are lower than that 
of the OECD region and the world. This study investigated the relationship 
between different types of healthcare expenditures (public, private and total) 
and three main health status outcomes - life expectancy at birth, crude death 
rate and infant mortality rate - in the region.
METHODOLOGY: Using the World Bank data set for 15 countries over a 20-year 
period (1995-2014), a panel data analysis was conducted where relevant fixed and 
random effect models were estimated to determine the effects of healthcare 
expenditure on health outcomes. The main variables studied were total health 
expenditure, public health expenditure, private health expenditure, GDP per 
capita, improved sanitation, life expectancy at birth, crude death rate and 
infant mortality rate.
RESULTS: Total health expenditure, public health expenditure and private health 
expenditure significantly reduced infant mortality rates, and, the extent of 
effect of private health expenditure was greater than that of public health 
expenditure. Private health expenditure also had a significant role in reducing 
the crude death rate. Per capita income growth and improved sanitation 
facilities also had significant positive roles in improving population health in 
the region.
CONCLUSIONS: Health expenditure in the SAARC-ASEAN region should be increased as 
our results indicated that it improved the health status of the population in 
the region. Public sector health funds must be appropriately and efficiently 
used, and accountability and transparency regarding spending of public health 
funds should be ensured. Finally, government and private institutes should 
implement appropriate strategies to improve sanitation facilities.

This paper examines the extent to which the black-white gap in happiness-an 
important indicator of subjective well-being-has narrowed over the 1972 to 2014 
period. Analyzing data from the General Social Survey, we find that that the 
difference in levels of happiness between whites and blacks is substantial, but 
declined over time. Results from a decomposition analysis shed new light on the 
sources of change. We find that observable differences in characteristics of 
whites and blacks explain a significant and growing proportion of the happiness 
gap. The two most important characteristics are income and marital status, as 
both are strongly associated with race and happiness, and the proportion of the 
difference in the gap that they explain has generally increased over time. 
Overall, the declining gap in happiness is consistent with the moderate 
narrowing of substantial racial disparities in other realms, such as life 
expectancy, residential segregation, and neighborhood conditions, suggesting 
small steps toward equality in some realms, even as high levels of inequality 
persist in others.

Wealth and health revisited: Economic growth and wellbeing in developing 
countries, 1970 to 2015.

Is wealthier always healthier, or are the health effects of economic growth 
trivial, irregular, or perhaps even detrimental? Using data for up to 134 
developing countries between 1970 and 2015, this article revisits the effect of 
economic growth on health, focusing on infant mortality, life expectancy, and 
caloric consumption. The analysis enlarges the geographical and temporal scope 
of previous samples and attempts to isolate the causal effects of growth using 
two-stage models with instrumental variables. Results show that five-year 
economic growth rates improve all three health outcomes, even after controlling 
for other important determinants and accounting for the possibility of reverse 
causality. Growth effects are largest for infant mortality rates. Nevertheless, 
there are diminishing returns to economic growth as a function of economic 
development: as countries become more affluent, the benefits of growth for 
health diminish.

OBJECTIVE: In rural areas of China with highly endemic for hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) infection, protective efficacy was observed in adulthood when a one-dose 
HBV vaccine booster was administered to high-risk children born to mothers who 
were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The aim of this study was 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an HBV vaccine booster in this specific 
group of children when given at 10 years of age.
METHODS: Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was a one-dose 
booster given if the child was negative on HBsAg screening; strategy 2 was a 
one-dose booster given if the child was negative on both HBsAg plus anti-HBs 
screening. A decision tree combined with a Markov model was developed to 
simulate the booster intervention process and to simulate the natural history of 
HBV infection in a cohort of 10-year-old children who were born to 
HBsAg-positive mothers. The model was calibrated based on multiple selected 
outcomes. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured from a 
societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) of the different 
strategies were compared in both base-case and one-way sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared to the current practice of 'no screening and no booster', both 
strategy 1 and strategy 2 were cost-saving, with CERs estimated at US$ -6961 and 
US$ -6872 per QALY gained, respectively. In the one-way sensitivity analysis for 
strategy 1, all the CERs were found to be less than US$ -5000 per QALY gained 
after considering the uncertainty of all the variables, including vaccination 
protective efficacy, natural history, behavior, and various costs and utility 
weights. In a 'worst case' scenario (all parameter values simultaneously being 
at the worst), the CER of strategy 1 increased to US$ 3263 per QALY gained, 
which was still less than the GDP per capita of China in 2016 (US$ 8126).
CONCLUSIONS: A hepatitis B vaccine booster given to children born to 
HBsAg-positive mothers in rural China would be cost-effective and could be 
considered in HBV endemic areas.

Acute primary angle closure requires emergency management that involves a rapid 
lowering of the intraocular pressure and resolution of relative pupil block - 
the most common mechanism of angle closure. Emergency strategies for lowering 
intraocular pressure include medical treatment and argon laser peripheral
