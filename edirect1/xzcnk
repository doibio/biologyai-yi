OBJECTIVE: We aimed to retrospectively analyze incidence, risk factors, and 
management of postoperative stent graft (SG) infection after endovascular 
aneurysm repair (EVAR).
METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent EVAR for infrarenal abdominal 
aortic aneurysm at our institution between July 2006 and December 2014. The 
primary end point was SG infection. We compared patients' demographics between 
the infection (group I) and noninfection (group NI) groups and reviewed 
management and outcomes in group I. A risk factor for SG infection was assessed 
by multivariable logistic regression. Patients without aortoenteric fistula 
(AEF) were treated with conservative therapy for SG infection.
RESULTS: A total of 1202 patients underwent EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic 
aneurysm. During a mean follow-up of 43.9 ± 30.4 months, SG infection occurred 
in 15 cases (incidence, 3.5/1000 person-years). The median time between initial 
EVAR and detection of infection was 30 months (range, 14 days-86 months). 
Freedom from SG infection at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years was 99.5%, 99.2%, and 
98.2%, respectively. There were no differences in age, sex, comorbidities, and 
SG type between the groups. Coil embolization of the hypogastric artery was more 
frequent in group I (60% vs 31%). During follow-up before infection, type II 
endoleak (47% vs 24%), sac enlargement (40% vs 16%), and multiple 
reinterventions (13% vs 2%) were significantly higher in group I; however, after 
multivariate analysis, only coil embolization of the hypogastric artery (odds 
ratio, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-9.24; P = .029) remained a 
significant predictor. Among the 15 patients, four had AEF and six bacteriologic 
species were detected in five patients (33%). Twelve patients (80%) were treated 
with conservative therapy; three underwent surgical therapy (two patients with 
SG resection, omentum patching, and extra-anatomic bypass with fistula closure 
or partial duodenectomy and one patient with graft preservation, irrigation, 
omentum patching, and aneurysmorrhaphy). In-hospital mortality occurred in three 
cases; two cases were due to sepsis after conservative therapy, and one case was 
due to aortic stump rupture after surgical therapy. Excluding in-hospital 
mortality cases, during a median follow-up of 31 (range, 2-76) months, five 
patients were lost because of cancer or senility. There was no aneurysm-related 
death or recurrence of SG infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant coil embolization was a risk factor for SG infection. 
For patients with AEF, surgical therapy remains the first-line treatment of SG 
infection after EVAR; however, conservative therapy is a viable option for SG 
infection in patients without AEF, particularly considering patients' 
comorbidities and limited life expectancy.

Chaharshanbeh souri is a historical Persian firework festival which has several 
health and financial damages for Iranians near celebration of New Year. In this 
study we tried to find effectiveness of Chaharshanbeh souri educational campaign 
on decreasing burden of injuries due to fireworks of this day. In this 
before-after study, an educational campaign was done for 2017 focusing on 
children and students. Data of a registry which was designed for gathering 
information of injuries and mortalities of this festival was used to show 
effectiveness of the program. Disability adjusted life years was calculated and 
compared before and after intervention. The results of this study showed that 
mean age of injuries was increased from 27.75 to 32.65 years and DALY decreased 
significantly after the intervention (P=0.0460) showing that the intervention 
was effective. Educational programs might be effective to decrease burden of 
injuries related to Chaharshanbeh souri festival.

PURPOSE: Thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules are the most prevalent form of 
thyroid endocrine disorder. The balance of gut microbiome is highly crucial for 
a healthy human body, especially for the immune and endocrine system. However, 
the relationship between gut microbiome and the thyroid endocrine disorders such 
as thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules has not been reported yet.
METHODS: A cohort of 74 patients was recruited for this study. Among them, 20 
patients had thyroid cancer, 18 patients had thyroid nodules, and 36 were 
matched healthy controls. Gut microbiome composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA 
(16S ribosomal RNA) gene-based sequencing protocol.
RESULTS: We compared the gut microbiome results of 74 subjects and established 
the correlation between gut microbiome and thyroid endocrine function for both 
thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules. The results inferred that alpha and beta 
diversity were different for patients with thyroid tumor than the healthy 
controls (p < 0.01). In comparison to healthy controls, the relative abundance 
of Neisseria (p < 0.001) and Streptococcus (p < 0.001) was significantly higher 
for thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules. Butyricimonas (p < 0.001) and 
Lactobacillus (p < 0.001) displayed notably lower relative abundance for thyroid 
cancer and thyroid nodules, respectively. It was also found that the clinical 
indexes were correlated with gut microbiome.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that both thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules 
are associated with the composition of gut microbiome. These results may support 
further clinical diagnosis to a great extent and help in developing potential 
probiotics to facilitate the treatment of thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules.

With an increase in the average life expectancy of the population, some 
histological types of symptomatic IEMT are more common in elderly and senile 
patients. Of the 45 patients included in the study, 27 (60%) patients underwent 
a microneurosurgical resection of the tumor tissue using minimally invasive 
techniques (minimally invasive group) and 18 (40%) to patients using the 
classical open method (open group). The duration of operative intervention in 
both cohorts of respondents is comparable and is 245,4±117,1 min and 261,1±108,6 
min for open and minimally invasive groups, respectively (p=0,71). The volume of 
blood loss in the minimally invasive group of patients (139,6±44,6 ml) was 
statistically significantly lower than in the open technique group (539,2±127,5 
ml) (p<0,01). The total degree of resection of tumor tissue was achieved in 
97,4% of patients in the open group and 92,8% in the minimally invasive group 
(p=0,81). The incidence of recurrence of IEMT in the study cohort of patients 
was 6,6%. At the same time, in 1 case the relapse of IEMT was verified in an 
open group of patients and in 2 cases in patients of the minimally invasive 
group. The average duration of hospitalization of patients of the minimally 
invasive group was 9,6±2,7 days, and the open group 13,5±3,1 (p<0,01). The 
comparison of the incidence of adverse events between the two groups of patients 
did not show significant differences (p=0,61).

Publisher: С увеличением средней продолжительности жизни населения некоторые 
гистологические типы симптоматичных интрадуральных экстрамедуллярных опухолей 
спинного мозга (ИЭМО) наблюдают чаще у пациентов пожилого и старческого 
возраста. Из 45 пациентов, включенных исследование, 27 (60%) выполнена 
микронейрохирургическая резекция опухолевой ткани с использованием 
минимально-инвазивных методик (минимально-инвазивная группа) и 18 (40%) —с 
применением классической открытой методики (открытая группа). Продолжительность 
оперативного вмешательства в обеих когортах респондентов является сопоставимой и 
составляет 245,4±117,1 и 261,1±108,6 мин для открытой и минимально-инвазивной 
групп соответственно (p=0,71). Объем кровопотери в минимально-инвазивной группе 
(139,6±44,6 мл) статистически значимо ниже, чем в открытой группе (539,2±125,5 
мл) (р<0,01). Тотальная степень резекции опухолевой ткани достигнута у 97,4% 
пациентов открытой группы и у 92,8% — минимально-инвазивной (p=0,81). Частота 
встречаемости рецидивов ИЭМО в исследуемой когорте пациентов составила 6,6%, при 
этом рецидив верифицирован у одного пациента открытой группы и у двух — 
минимально-инвазивной. Средняя продолжительность госпитализации пациентов 
минимально-инвазивной группы составила 9,6±2,7 койко-дня, а открытой группы –– 
13,5±3,1 (p<0,01). Сравнение частоты развития нежелательных явлений между двумя 
группами пациентов не показало достоверных различий (p=0,61).

The lack of endogenous repair following spinal cord injury (SCI) accounts for 
the frequent permanent deficits for which effective treatments are absent. 
Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics 
(LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel 
therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to 
resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both 
sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of 
ligand-receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination 
and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or 
demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with 
varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced 
neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had 
attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension 
in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their 
proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors 
secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from 
cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by 
applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these 
cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair 
mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide 
(1-42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures 
and shown to inhibit myelination. Thus, we propose that LS-mHeps exert multiple 
beneficial effects on mechanisms supporting enhanced repair, and represent novel 
candidates as therapeutics for CNS damage.

Management of early-onset hip osteoarthritis in an adolescent patient with 
osteopetrosis tarda: a case report.

Osteopetrosis (OP) is a group of rare sclerosing bone dysplasia characterized by 
increased bone density. The benign autosomal dominant form is the most common 
type. It typically carries a full life expectancy, despite increased propensity 
for fractures and other musculoskeletal problems, particularly hip 
osteoarthritis. In the current literature, the youngest OP patient having hip 
osteoarthritis is 16 years of age and treated with total hip arthroplasty. 
Within the present study, a 16-year-old female patient with early-onset hip 
osteoarthritis treated with hip joint debridement and femoral head reshaping is 
presented. The pain relieved and hip joint movements recovered to almost normal 
range. At the final follow-up at 2 years after the surgery, the patient was 
still free of pain and ambulating without restriction. Hip joint debridement and 
femoral shaping may be beneficial in hip osteoarthritis secondary to OP in 
adolescents, and may delay hip arthroplasty in a young age.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the age and life expectancy of the general population 
rise, the number of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients suitable for therapy 
is expected to dramatically increase. The population of older adults with AML, 
while already comprising the vast majority of AML patients, has not been 
specifically addressed in terms of unique age-related features, such as 
existence of comorbidities, frailty, and disease biology.
RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past decade, major improvements in the approach to the 
management of older adults with AML included: incorporation of new comorbidity 
scores specifically oriented to this patient population that can predict 
individual fitness to treatment, refined knowledge of the unique mutational 
landscape, and incorporating new combinations and novel agents designed to 
target the AML biology. Particularly, the recent exciting description of 
age-related clonal hematopoiesis and its evolution to AML may open new avenues 
for intervention prior to development of full-blown leukemia.
SUMMARY: The rising awareness of the unique biology and special needs of older 
adults with AML has resulted in the design of new studies aiming to target the 
aberrant mutations and clinical characteristics in this patient population.

Risk of Skin Cancers in Older Persons Living With HIV: A Systematic Review.

Yeung H, Balakrishnan V, Luk KMH, Chen SC.

Skin cancers-including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and 
melanoma-impose high incidence and morbidity in older persons. As life 
expectancy continues to increase in persons living with HIV (PLWH), this 
population may face an increased risk of non-AIDS-defining malignancies, such as 
skin cancers. We conducted a systematic review on skin cancer risks in PLWH, 
ages 50 years or older, as compared with age-matched, HIV-uninfected persons. 
Four studies met criteria and were included. No statistically significant 
associations were demonstrated between HIV infection and skin cancers in older 
persons. For those with a history of basal or squamous cell carcinoma, HIV 
infection was associated with higher risks of subsequent squamous cell 
carcinoma. Future studies are needed to elucidate and reduce morbidity of 
primary and multiple skin cancers to promote successful aging in PLWH.

A Patient-Centered Approach to Comparative Effectiveness Research Focused on 
Older Adults: Lessons From the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.

Columbia.

The mission of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) is to 
fund the production of high-quality evidence that will enable patients and 
clinicians to make informed, personalized healthcare decisions. Since 2012, the 
PCORI has invested $177 million in patient-centered comparative effectiveness 
research (CER) that specifically targets the health needs of older adults, with 
additional relevant studies in its broader portfolio. Developing the PCORI's 
research portfolio has provided us with significant insights into what factors 
to consider when conducting CER in older adult populations. When comparing the 
net benefit of two or more interventions for older adults, investigators should 
consider the following: absolute risk difference, competing risks, life 
expectancy, the difference between chronologic and physiologic age, the 
importance of patient preferences, and other potential drivers of variable 
treatment effects. Investigators should also engage older adults and their 
caregivers as partners throughout the research process. Their input helps to 
identify key outcomes of interest and insights about the conduct of the 
research. As the PCORI continues to support research that addresses the 
healthcare decisions of the rapidly growing older adult population, it needs to 
partner with patients and researchers to identify the most important questions 
to address. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:21-28, 2019.

Failure to demonstrate short-cutting in a replication and extension of Tolman et 
al.'s spatial learning experiment with humans.

Successful demonstrations of novel short-cut taking by animals, including 
humans, are open to interpretation in terms of learning that is not necessarily 
spatial. A classic example is that of Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish (1946) who 
allowed rats to repeat a sequence of turns through the corridors of a maze to 
locate a food reward. When the entrance to the corridors was subsequently 
blocked and alternative corridors were made available, rats successfully 
selected the corridor leading most directly to the food location. However, the 
presence of a distinctive light above the goal, in both the training and testing 
phases, means that approach to the light as a beacon could have been the source 
of successful short-cutting. We report a replication of the experimental design 
of Tolman et al. with human participants who explored geometrically equivalent 
virtual environments. An experimental group, who followed the original procedure 
in the absence of any distinctive cues proximal to the goal, did not select the 
corridor which led most directly to the goal. A control group, who experienced a 
light above the goal during training and testing, were more likely to select a 
corridor which led in the direction of the goal. A second control group 
experienced the light above the goal during training, but in the test the 
location of this cue was shifted by 90° with respect to the start point of 
exploration. This latter group responded unsystematically in the test, neither 
selecting a corridor leading to the original goal location, nor one leading 
directly to the relocated light cue. The results do not support the hypothesis 
that travelling a multi-path route automatically leads to an integrated 
cognitive representation of that route. The data offer support for the 
importance of local cues which can serve as beacons to indicate the location of 
a goal.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the value to society of improved survival from novel 
immuno-oncology (I-O) treatments.
STUDY DESIGN: Case studies of ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced 
unresectable melanoma and nivolumab for advanced previously treated squamous 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Published data and survival analysis were used to estimate survival 
gains. We valued the gains using an economic model developed for application to 
discrete changes in life expectancy. We estimated aggregate utilization and 
value to society using cancer registry data and literature. We assessed the 
share of social value that flowed to the pharmaceutical manufacturer as sales 
revenue based on publicly available prices.
RESULTS: For advanced melanoma, our analysis estimated an average real-world 
life expectancy (discounted at a 3% rate) of 32.4 months with ipilimumab versus 
14.2 months with an existing standard of care. Treatment of advanced NSCLC with 
nivolumab generated a life expectancy of 28.1 months versus 14.3 months with an 
existing standard of care. Depending on model assumptions, the value of these 
survival gains ranged from $232,000 to $697,000 for a patient with melanoma and 
from $180,000 to $586,000 for one with NSCLC. Using a midpoint value to 
aggregate across treated patients over a 5-year window, the total value to 
society was estimated at $1.9 billion for ipilimumab in advanced melanoma and 
$1.7 billion for nivolumab in NSCLC. Less than 30% of the total value flowed to 
the pharmaceutical manufacturer in the form of profit.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel I-O treatments studied here generate substantial survival

The global epidemic of obesity is a major public health problem today. Obesity 
increases the risk of many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, and certain types of cancer, and is associated with lower life 
expectancy. The body mass index (BMI), which is currently used to classify 
obesity, is only an imperfect measure of abnormal or excessive body fat 
accumulation. Studies have shown that waist circumference as a measure of fat 
distribution may improve disease prediction. More elaborate techniques such as 
magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly available to assess body fat 
distribution, but these measures are not readily available in routine clinical 
practice, and health-relevant cut-offs not yet been established. The measurement 
of biomarkers that reflect the underlying biological mechanisms for the 
increased disease risk may be an alternative approach to characterize the 
relevant obesity phenotype. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis 
and chronic low-grade inflammation have been identified as major pathways. In 
addition, specific adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin have been 
related to obesity-associated health outcomes. This biomarker research, which is 
currently further developed with the application of high throughput methods, 
gives important insights in obesity-related disease etiology and 
pathophysiological pathways and may be used to better characterize obese persons 
at high risk of disease development and target disease-causing biomarkers in 
personalized prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: In patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at intermediate 
surgical risk, treatment with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or 
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) results in similar rates of death or 
stroke at 2 years. Whether TAVR is cost-effective compared with SAVR for 
intermediate-risk patients remains uncertain.
METHODS: Between 2011 and 2014, 3110 intermediate-risk AS patients were treated 
with TAVR or SAVR in the PARTNER 2 trial (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter 
Valves 2). A total of 2032 patients were randomized to receive TAVR using the 
SAPIEN XT valve (XT-TAVR) or SAVR in the PARTNER 2A trial, whereas the PARTNER 
S3i registry included an additional 1078 patients treated with TAVR using the 
SAPIEN 3 valve (S3-TAVR), which offers a lower delivery profile and sealing 
skirt designed to reduce paravalvular regurgitation compared with XT-TAVR. 
Procedural costs were estimated using measured resource utilization. Other 
in-trial costs were assessed by linkage of trial data with Medicare claims 
(n=2333) or by linear regression models for unlinked patients (n=682). Health 
utilities were estimated using the EQ-5D at baseline and 1, 12, and 24 months. 
Using a Markov model informed by in-trial costs, utilities, and survival data, 
lifetime cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the US healthcare system was 
estimated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
RESULTS: Although procedural costs were ≈$20 000 higher with TAVR than SAVR, 
total cost differences for the index hospitalization were only $2888 higher with 
XT-TAVR ( P=0.014) and were $4155 lower with S3-TAVR ( P<0.001) owing to 
reductions in length of stay with TAVR. Follow-up costs were significantly lower 
with XT-TAVR (Δ=-$9304; P<0.001) and S3-TAVR (Δ=-$11 377; P<0.001) than with 
SAVR. Over a lifetime horizon, TAVR was projected to lower total costs by $8000 
to $10 000 and to increase quality-adjusted survival by 0.15 to 0.27 years. 
XT-TAVR and S3-TAVR were found to be economically dominant compared with SAVR in 
84% and 97% of bootstrap replicates, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Among intermediate-risk AS patients, TAVR is projected to be 
economically dominant from the perspective of the US healthcare system by 
providing both greater quality-adjusted life expectancy and lower long-term 
costs than SAVR. If long-term data demonstrate comparable late mortality with 
TAVR and SAVR, these findings suggest that TAVR might be the preferred treatment 
strategy for intermediate-risk AS patients based on both clinical and economic 
considerations.

BACKGROUND: Protein restriction may retard the need for renal replacement 
therapy; compliance is considered a barrier, especially in elderly patients.
METHODS: A feasibility study was conducted in a newly organized unit for 
advanced kidney disease; three diet options were offered: normalization of 
protein intake (0.8 g/kg/day of protein); moderate protein restriction (0.6 
g/kg/day of protein) with a "traditional" mixed protein diet or with a 
"plant-based" diet supplemented with ketoacids. Patients with protein energy 
wasting (PEW), short life expectancy or who refused were excluded. Compliance 
was estimated by Maroni-Mitch formula and food diary.
RESULTS: In November 2017⁻July 2018, 131 patients started the program: median 
age 74 years (min⁻max 24-101), Charlson Index (CCI): 8 (min-max: 2⁻14); eGFR 24 
mL/min (4⁻68); 50.4% were diabetic, BMI was ≥ 30 kg/m² in 40.4%. Normalization 
was the first step in 75 patients (57%, age 78 (24⁻101), CCI 8 (2⁻12), eGFR 24 
mL/min (8⁻68)); moderately protein-restricted traditional diets were chosen by 
24 (18%, age 74 (44⁻91), CCI 8 (4⁻14), eGFR 22 mL/min (5⁻40)), plant-based diets 
by 22 (17%, age 70 (34⁻89), CCI 6.5 (2⁻12), eGFR 15 mL/min (5⁻46)) (p < 0.001). 
Protein restriction was not undertaken in 10 patients with short life 
expectancy. In patients with ≥ 3 months of follow-up, median reduction of 
protein intake was from 1.2 to 0.8 g/kg/day (p < 0.001); nutritional parameters 
remained stable; albumin increased from 3.5 to 3.6 g/dL (p = 0.037); good 
compliance was found in 74%, regardless of diets. Over 1067 patient-months of 
follow-up, 9 patients died (CCI 10 (6⁻12)), 7 started dialysis (5 incremental).
CONCLUSION: Protein restriction is feasible by an individualized, stepwise 
approach in an overall elderly, high-comorbidity population with a baseline 
high-protein diet and is compatible with stable nutritional status.

Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) has been considered as an effective way to help 
and support both the disabled rehabilitation and healthy individuals' daily 
lives to use their brain activity information instead of their bodies. In order 
to reduce costs and control exoskeleton robots better, we aim to estimate the 
necessary torque information for a subject from his/her electroencephalography 
(EEG) signals when using an exoskeleton robot to perform the power assistance of 
the upper limb without using external torque sensors nor electromyography (EMG) 
sensors. In this paper, we focus on extracting the motion-relevant EEG signals' 
features of the shoulder joint, which is the most complex joint in the human's 
body, to construct a power assistance system using wearable upper limb 
exoskeleton robots with BMI technology. We extract the characteristic EEG 
signals when the shoulder joint is doing flexion and extension movement freely 
which are the main motions of the shoulder joint needed to be assisted. 
Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to extract the source information 
of neural components, and then the average method is used to extract the 
characteristic signals that are fundamental to achieve the control. The proposed 
approach has been experimentally verified. The results show that EEG signals 
begin to increase at 300⁻400 ms before the motion and then decrease at the 
beginning of the generation of EMG signals, and the peaks appear at about one 
second after the motion. At the same time, we also confirmed the relationship 
between the change of EMG signals and the EEG signals on the time dimension, and 
these results also provide a theoretical basis for the delay parameter in the 
linear model which will be used to estimate the necessary torque information in 
future. Our results suggest that the estimation of torque information based on 
EEG signals is feasible, and demonstrate the potential of using EEG signals via 
the control of brain-machine interface to support human activities continuously.

Timely Referral to Hospice Care for Oncology Patients: A Retrospective Review.

Hospice care is medical care provided to terminally ill patients with a life 
expectancy of 6 months or less. Hospice services include symptom control, pain 
management, palliative care, and other supportive services such as providing for 
home equipment or oxygen; however, it does not provide for life-prolonging 
therapies such as chemotherapy. Although oncologic benchmarks suggest patients 
should be enrolled in hospice 3 months prior to death, studies show that most 
hospice referrals are being made too late. These shorter stays in hospice result 
in increased cost of care especially at the end of life with most patients dying 
on aggressive treatments in the hospital. Thus, identifying barriers to hospice 
placement is critical in improving the referral process and enhancing the 
quality of end-of-life care. This retrospective study collected data on 418 
oncologic patients who passed in 2015 and categorized patients based on hospice 
status at the time of death. Our study found that the demographics between 
hospice and nonhospice patients were not significantly different. Hospice 
patients spent a median of 10 days in hospice and 71% (n = 161) of patients were 
in hospice 30 days or less. Additionally, 56% of patients were in hospice 10 
days or less. Increased education for patients and health-care providers along 
with better utilization of palliative care services and incorporating a nurse 
navigator to help with transitioning patients to hospice would improve earlier 
referral to hospice care and enhance patients' quality of life.

Queens stay, workers leave: caste-specific responses to fatal infections in an 
ant.

BACKGROUND: The intense interactions among closely related individuals in animal 
societies provide perfect conditions for the spread of pathogens. Social insects 
have therefore evolved counter-measures on the cellular, individual, and social 
level to reduce the infection risk. One striking example is altruistic 
self-removal, i.e., lethally infected workers leave the nest and die in 
isolation to prevent the spread of a contagious disease to their nestmates. 
Because reproductive queens and egg-laying workers behave less altruistically 
than non-laying workers, e.g., when it comes to colony defense, we wondered 
whether moribund egg-layers would show the same self-removal as non-reproductive 
workers. Furthermore, we investigated how a lethal infection affects 
reproduction and studied if queens and egg-laying workers intensify their 
reproductive efforts when their residual reproductive value decreases ("terminal 
investment").
RESULTS: We treated queens, egg-laying workers from queenless colonies, and 
non-laying workers from queenright colonies of the monogynous (single-queened) 
ant Temnothorax crassispinus either with a control solution or a solution 
containing spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum. Lethally 
infected workers left the nest and died away from it, regardless of their 
reproductive status. In contrast, infected queens never left the nest and were 
removed by workers only after they had died. The reproductive investment of 
queens strongly decreased after the treatment with both, the control solution 
and the Metarhizium brunneum suspension. The egg laying rate in queenless 
colonies was initially reduced in infected colonies but not in control colonies. 
Egg number increased again with decreasing number of infected workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Queens and workers of the ant Temnothorax crassispinus differ in 
their reaction to an infection risk and a reduced life expectancy. Workers 
isolate themselves to prevent contagion inside the colony, whereas queens stay 
in the nest. We did not find terminal investment; instead it appeared that 
egg-layers completely shut down egg production in response to the lethal 
infection. Workers in queenless colonies resumed reproduction only after all 
infected individuals had died, probably again to minimize the risk of infecting 
the offspring.

Osteoporosis represents the most common bone disease worldwide and results in a 
significantly increased fracture risk. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors 
implicated in the development of osteoporosis are also associated with delayed 
fracture healing and impaired bone regeneration. Based on a steadily increasing 
life expectancy in modern societies, the global implications of osteoporosis and 
impaired bone healing are substantial. Research in the last decades has revealed 
several molecular pathways that stimulate bone formation and could be targeted 
to treat both osteoporosis and impaired fracture healing. The identification and 
development of therapeutic approaches modulating bone formation, rather than 
bone resorption, fulfils an essential clinical need, as treatment options for 
reversing bone loss and promoting bone regeneration are limited. This review 
focuses on currently available and future approaches that may have the potential 
to achieve these aims.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, diameter ≤2.5 μm) is implicated as the most 
health-damaging air pollutant. Large cohort studies of chronic exposure to PM2.5 
and mortality risk are largely confined to areas with low to moderate ambient 
PM2.5 concentrations and posit log-linear exposure-response functions. However, 
levels of PM2.5 in developing countries such as India are typically much higher, 
causing unknown health effects. Integrated exposure-response functions for high 
PM2.5 exposures encompassing risk estimates from ambient air, secondhand smoke, 
and active smoking exposures have been posited. We apply these functions to 
estimate the future cause-specific mortality risks associated with 
population-weighted ambient PM2.5 exposures in India in 2030 using Greenhouse 
Gas-Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model projections. The loss 
in statistical life expectancy (SLE) is calculated based on risk estimates and 
baseline mortality rates. Losses in SLE are aggregated and weighted using 
national age-adjusted, cause-specific mortality rates. 2030 PM2.5 pollution in 
India reaches an annual mean of 74 μg/m³, nearly eight times the corresponding 
World Health Organization air quality guideline. The national average loss in 
SLE is 32.5 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 29.7⁻35.2, regional range: 
8.5⁻42.0), compared to an average of 53.7 months (95% CI: 46.3⁻61.1) using 
methods currently applied in GAINS. Results indicate wide regional variation in 
health impacts, and these methods may still underestimate the total health 
burden caused by PM2.5 exposures due to model assumptions on minimum age 
thresholds of pollution effects and a limited subset of health endpoints 
analyzed. Application of the revised exposure-response functions suggests that 
the most polluted areas in India will reap major health benefits only with 
substantial improvements in air quality.
