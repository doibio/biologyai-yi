BACKGROUND: Obesity affects quality of life and life expectancy and is 
associated with cardiovascular disorders, cancer, diabetes, reproductive 
disorders in women, prostate diseases in men, and congenital anomalies in 
children. The use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of diseases 
and drug responses (i.e., significant differences of personal genomes of 
patients from the reference human genome) can help physicians to improve 
treatment. Clinical research can validate SNP markers via genotyping of patients 
and demonstration that SNP alleles are significantly more frequent in patients 
than in healthy people. The search for biomedical SNP markers of interest can be 
accelerated by computer-based analysis of hundreds of millions of SNPs in the 
1000 Genomes project because of selection of the most meaningful candidate SNP 
markers and elimination of neutral SNPs.
RESULTS: We cross-validated the output of two computer-based methods: DNA 
sequence analysis using Web service SNP_TATA_Comparator and keyword search for 
articles on comorbidities of obesity. Near the sites binding to TATA-binding 
protein (TBP) in human gene promoters, we found 22 obesity-related candidate SNP 
markers, including rs10895068 (male breast cancer in obesity); rs35036378 
(reduced risk of obesity after ovariectomy); rs201739205 (reduced risk of 
obesity-related cancers due to weight loss by diet/exercise in obese 
postmenopausal women); rs183433761 (obesity resistance during a high-fat diet); 
rs367732974 and rs549591993 (both: cardiovascular complications in obese 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus); rs200487063 and rs34104384 (both: 
obesity-caused hypertension); rs35518301, rs72661131, and rs562962093 (all: 
obesity); and rs397509430, rs33980857, rs34598529, rs33931746, rs33981098, 
rs34500389, rs63750953, rs281864525, rs35518301, and rs34166473 (all: chronic 
inflammation in comorbidities of obesity). Using an electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay under nonequilibrium conditions, we empirically validated the 
statistical significance (α < 0.00025) of the differences in TBP affinity values 
between the minor and ancestral alleles of 4 out of the 22 SNPs: rs200487063, 
rs201381696, rs34104384, and rs183433761. We also measured half-life (t1/2), 
Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), and the association and dissociation rate 
constants, ka and kd, of the TBP-DNA complex for these SNPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Validation of the 22 candidate SNP markers by proper clinical 
protocols appears to have a strong rationale and may advance postgenomic 
predictive preventive personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction (CR) can increase longevity in rodents and 
improve memory function in humans. α-Lipoic acid (LA) has been shown to improve 
memory function in rats, but not longevity. While studies have looked at 
survival in rodents after switching from one diet to another, the underlying 
mechanisms of the beneficial effects of CR and LA supplementation are unknown. 
Here, we use RNA-seq in cerebral cortex from rats subjected to CR and 
LA-supplemented rats to understand how changes in diet can affect aging, 
neurodegeneration and longevity.
RESULTS: Gene expression changes during aging in ad libitum-fed rats are largely 
prevented by CR, and neuroprotective genes are overexpressed in response to both 
CR and LA diets with a strong overlap of differentially expressed genes between 
the two diets. Moreover, a number of genes are differentially expressed 
specifically in rat cohorts exhibiting diet-induced life extension. Finally, we 
observe that LA supplementation inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) protein 
activity in vitro in rat astrocytes. We find a single microRNA, miR-98-3p, that 
is overexpressed during CR feeding and LA dietary supplementation; this microRNA 
alters HDAC and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which suggests a role 
for HAT/HDAC homeostasis in neuroprotection.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents extensive data on the effects of diet and aging 
on the cerebral cortex transcriptome, and also emphasises the importance of 
epigenetics and post-translational modifications in longevity and 
neuroprotection.

OBJECTIVES: The headroom approach to medical device development relies on the 
estimation of a value-based price ceiling at different stages of the development 
cycle. Such price-ceilings delineate the commercial opportunities for new 
products in many healthcare systems. We apply a simple model to obtain critical 
business information as the product proceeds along a development pathway, and 
indicate some future directions for the development of the approach.
METHODS: Health economic modelling in the supply-side development cycle for new 
products.
RESULTS: The headroom can be used: initially as a 'reality check' on the 
viability of the device in the healthcare market; to support product development 
decisions using a real options approach; and to contribute to a pricing policy 
which respects uncertainties in the reimbursement outlook.
CONCLUSIONS: The headroom provides a unifying thread for business decisions 
along the development cycle for a new product. Over the course of the cycle 
attitudes to uncertainty will evolve, based on the timing and manner in which 
new information accrues. Within this framework the developmental value of new 
information can justify the costs of clinical trials and other 
evidence-gathering activities. Headroom can function as a simple shared tool to 
parties in commercial negotiations around individual products or groups of 
products. The development of similar approaches in other contexts holds promise 
for more rational planning of service provision.

PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the changes in pain intensity and quality of 
life (QoL) experienced by patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) 
treated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and conventional medical practice 
(CMP).
METHODS: Patient-reported pain intensity and QoL data were obtained from 
participants in an international multicentre randomised controlled trial 
comparing SCS versus CMP. Data were collected at randomisation and 6 month 
follow up by means of a visual analogue scale for pain intensity, the EuroQoL 
Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the EuroQol EQ-5D index. Quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) were calculated for each treatment using the 'area under the 
curve' method. Differences in QALYs were calculated after adjusting for 
between-treatment imbalances in baseline QoL.
RESULTS: At 6 months, patients allocated to SCS reported larger reductions in 
pain intensity and improvements in QoL measured by the EQ-5D utility score and 
EQ VAS as compared to those allocated to CMP. Initial calculations of QALYs for 
the SCS and CMP groups suggested no statistical differences between the groups. 
Adjusting for imbalances in baseline EQ-5D scores showed SCS to be associated 
with significantly higher QALYs compared to CMP.
CONCLUSIONS: SCS resulted in significant improvement in pain intensity and QoL 
in patients with PDN, offering further support for SCS as an effective treatment 
for patients suffering from PDN. From a methodological point of view, different 
results would have been obtained if QALY calculations were not adjusted for 
baseline EQ-5D scores, highlighting the need to account for imbalances in 
baseline QoL.

Although it is well documented that dietary restriction (DR) increases the life 
span of rodents and other animals, this increase is observed at relatively high 
levels of DR, in which rodents are typically fed 40% less than that consumed by 
rodents fed ad libitum. It is generally assumed that lower levels of DR will 
have a lesser impact on life span; however, there are very little published data 
on the effect of low levels of DR on life span. In this study, we show that 10% 
DR increased life span to almost the same extent as 40% DR. While both 10% and 
40% DR resulted in similar changes in non-neoplastic lesions, 10% DR had no 
significant effect on the incidence of neoplasia (except for pituitary adenoma), 
and 40% DR resulted in a significant reduction (40%) in neoplasia. These data 
clearly demonstrate that the life span of F344 rats does not increase linearly 
with the level of DR; rather, even a low level of DR can substantially affect 
life span. This rodent study has important translational implications because it 
suggests that a modest reduction in calories might have significant health 
benefits for humans.

The most popular therapeutic option in the management of radio-recurrent 
prostatic carcinoma is represented by the androgen deprivation therapy, that 
however should be considered only palliative and hampered by potential adverse 
effects of testosterone suppression. Local therapies such as surgery, 
cryoablation or brachytherapy might be curative choices for patients in good 
conditions and with a long-life expectancy, but at cost of significant risk of 
failure and severe toxicity. The administration of stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) in this setting have come about because of tremendous technologic 
advances in image guidance and treatment delivery techniques that enable the 
delivery of large doses to tumor with reduced margins and high gradients outside 
the target, thereby reducing the volume of rectum which already received 
significant doses from primary radiotherapy. So far, very modest data are 
available to support its employment. Rationale, clinical experience, and 
challenges are herein reviewed and discussed.

With increasing life expectancy, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other types of 
age-associated dementia are on the rise worldwide. Treatment approaches for 
dementia are insufficient and novel therapies are not readily available. In this 
context repurposing of established drugs appears attractive. A well-established 
class of cardiovascular drugs, which targets the angiotensin II system, is such 
a candidate, which currently undergoes a paradigm shift with regard to the 
potential benefit for treatment of neurodegenerative symptoms. In search for 
additional evidence, we subjected aged rats to chronic unpredictable mild 
stress, which is known to enhance the development of AD-related 
neuropathological features. We report here that four weeks of chronic mild 
stress induced a strong upregulation of the hippocampal angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (Ace) at gene expression and protein level. Concomitantly, tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation developed. Signs of neurodegeneration were detected by the 
significant downregulation of neuronal structure proteins such as 
microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2) and synuclein-gamma (Sncg). Ace was 
involved in neurodegenerative symptoms because treatment with the 
brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor, captopril, retarded tau hyperphosphorylation 
and signs of neurodegeneration. Moreover, ACE inhibitor treatment could 
counteract glutamate neurotoxicity by preventing the downregulation of glutamate 
decarboxylase 2 (Gad2). Taken together, ACE inhibition targets neurodegeneration 
triggered by environmental stress.

Introduction. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 53% of deaths and 44% 
of disability adjusted life years lost in India. A survey was undertaken to 
measure the prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use and self-reported NCDs in a 
rural community in western part of India. Methodology. Trained Village Health 
Workers did the survey in the years 2012-13 under supervision. The data was 
collected for five NCDs, namely, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, heart 
disease, and mental illnesses. Results. 18,269 households with a population of 
89755 were covered. Prevalence of any form of tobacco use in the age group of 
>20 years was 34.5 and 52.7% and 15.2% in males and females, respectively. 
Prevalence of any NCD was 5.3% with a slightly higher prevalence in females 
(5.4%) than males (5.2%) in the age group of 20-69 years. Prevalence of NCD 
multimorbidity (≥2 NCDs) was 0.7% in the age group of 20-69 years. 80.7% of 
hypertensives and 94.9% of diabetics were taking treatment. More females than 
males were taking antihypertensive treatment. Conclusion. Tobacco use was high. 
Prevalence of NCDs was less than that reported in other studies. Data generated 
from this study can be useful in planning a community based NCD programme.

Health maintenance and low socio-economic status: A family perspective.

Ncho CD, Wright SC.

The socio-economic status of people has a profound influence on health, as 
higher rates of morbidity and mortality are reported for individuals with lower 
socio-economic status. Due to the increased burden of disease, research 
exploring how families maintain their health in a low socio-economic situation 
is an urgent priority. The objective of the study was to gain an understanding 
of the reality families are confronted with in terms of their health due to 
their socio-economic status. The study was contextual, qualitative and 
exploratory using purposive sampling methods. The sample size was governed by 
data saturation and realised as 17 families (n=17). The participants for the 
study were families residing in Soshanguve Extension 12 and 13, South Africa. 
The data collection method was self-report using a semi-structured interview. 
Content analysis was done according to Tesch’s approach using open coding. Five 
themes based on the theoretical basis of the study, including age, sex and 
genetic constitution, individual lifestyle factors, social and community 
networks, living and working conditions and general socio-economic status were 
used. Maintaining the health of people living in a physically and psychosocially 
disadvantaged position requires a different approach from registered 
professional nurses. No community-specific intervention can be planned and 
implemented to reduce the burden of communicable and non-communicable disease in 
the community without evidence based on a family perspective.

PURPOSE: The fibula free flap (FFF) is a standard method for osseous 
reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to investigate functional deficits 
after harvesting a free fibula flap.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We designed and implemented a prospective clinical cohort 
study. The study sample consisted of patients undergoing mandible resection and 
reconstruction with a fibula free flap. The primary endpoint was the 
time-dependent difference in maximum peak power per body mass (MPP). In 
addition, balance ability, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) 
score, sensory limitations, general surgical complications, and the range of 
motion were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were examined pre- and postoperatively (8 months 
on average). MPP and balance ability were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) 
postoperatively. Furthermore, a deficit in dorsal extension and a considerable 
reduction of the AOFAS score were recorded. For the primary outcome, there were 
no significant predictors on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a postoperative reduction of lower limb 
performance with a relevant impact on everyday activities, equivalent to the 
average loss of 7 life years of a healthy, fit individual. However, these data 
do not challenge the value of this commonly used microvascular graft. Future 
efforts should focus on the development of strategies to minimize the associated 
donor-site morbidity.

BACKGROUND: The disability adjusted life year (DALY) is a composite measure of 
disease burden that includes both morbidity and mortality, and is relevant to 
conditions such as epilepsy that can limit productive functioning. The 2010 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study introduced a number of new methods and 
definitions, including a prevalence-based approach and revised disability 
weights to calculate morbidity and new standard life expectancies to calculate 
premature mortality. We used these approaches, and local, population-based data, 
to estimate the burden of convulsive epilepsy in rural South Africa.
METHODS & FINDINGS: Comprehensive prevalence, incidence and mortality data on 
convulsive epilepsy were collected within the Agincourt sub-district in rural 
northeastern South Africa between 2008 and 2012. We estimated DALYs using both 
prevalence- and incidence-based approaches for calculating years of life lived 
with disability. Additionally, we explored how changing the disease model by 
varying the disability weights influenced DALY estimates. Using the 
prevalence-based approach, convulsive epilepsy in Agincourt resulted in 332 
DALYs (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 216-455) and 4.1 DALYs per 1,000 
individuals (95%UI: 2.7-5.7) annually. Of this, 26% was due to morbidity while 
74% was due to premature mortality. DALYs increased by 10% when using the 
incidence-based method. Varying the disability weight from 0.072 (treated 
epilepsy, seizure free) to 0.657 (severe epilepsy) caused years lived with 
disability to increase from 18 (95%UI: 16-19) to 161 (95%UI: 143-170).
CONCLUSIONS: DALY estimates are influenced by both the methods applied and 
population parameters used in the calculation. Irrespective of method, a 
significant burden of epilepsy is due to premature mortality in rural South 
Africa, with a lower burden than rural Kenya. Researchers and national 
policymakers should carefully interrogate the methods and data used to calculate 
DALYs as this will influence policy priorities and resource allocation.

Activation of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) in rheumatic diseases.

Perl A(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Rheumatology, Departments of Medicine, Microbiology and 
Immunology, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State University of New 
York, Upstate Medical University, College of Medicine, 750 East Adams Street, 
Syracuse, New York 13210, USA.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as mammalian target of 
rapamycin) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, 
proliferation and survival. These effects are cell-type-specific, and are 
elicited in response to stimulation by growth factors, hormones and cytokines, 
as well as to internal and external metabolic cues. Rapamycin was initially 
developed as an inhibitor of T-cell proliferation and allograft rejection in the 
organ transplant setting. Subsequently, its molecular target (mTOR) was 
identified as a component of two interacting complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that 
regulate T-cell lineage specification and macrophage differentiation. mTORC1 
drives the proinflammatory expansion of T helper (TH) type 1, TH17, and 
CD4(-)CD8(-) (double-negative, DN) T cells. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibit the 
development of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory (TREG) cells and, indirectly, 
mTORC2 favours the expansion of T follicular helper (TFH) cells which, similarly 
to DN T cells, promote B-cell activation and autoantibody production. In 
contrast to this proinflammatory effect of mTORC2, mTORC1 favours, to some 
extent, an anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization that is protective against 
infections and tissue inflammation. Outside the immune system, mTORC1 controls 
fibroblast proliferation and chondrocyte survival, with implications for tissue 
fibrosis and osteoarthritis, respectively. Rapamycin (which primarily inhibits 
mTORC1), ATP-competitive, dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors and upstream regulators 
of the mTOR pathway are being developed to treat autoimmune, hyperproliferative 
and degenerative diseases. In this regard, mTOR blockade promises to increase 
life expectancy through treatment and prevention of rheumatic diseases.

AIMS: Documentation of advance directives among patients with terminal cancer is 
known to be poor. Here we describe documentation of prognosis, treatment benefit 
and goals of care discussions in outpatients with advanced cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients receiving first-line palliative chemotherapy 
for metastatic pancreas or lung cancers during 2010-2013 at the Cancer Centre of 
Southeastern Ontario were identified from electronic pharmacy records. Clinical 
notes from medical oncology were reviewed to identify documentation of 
discussions regarding prognosis, treatment benefit and goals of care. 
Differences between groups were tested using the chi-squared test.
RESULTS: In total, 222 patients were included: 80% (177/222) with lung cancer 
and 20% (45/222) with pancreas cancer. Medical oncology notes documented 
discussion of prognosis in 64% (142/222), palliative intent of therapy in 82% 
(182/222), magnitude of treatment benefit in 29% (64/222) and goals of care in 
4% (9/222) of patients. An estimate of survival was documented in 36% (79/222) 
of cases. Across medical oncology providers there was substantial variation in 
the frequency of discussing prognosis (range 33-90%, P < 0.001), treatment 
intent (range 55-100%, P < 0.001) and goals of care (range 0-17%, P = 0.034). In 
total, 41% (93/222) of patients were seen by palliative care; substantial 
medical oncology provider variation was observed (range 27-58%, P = 0.020). 
Referral rates to palliative care did not increase over time (41-44%, 
P = 0.250).
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of ambulatory patients with an estimated life 
expectancy of 1 year or less, medical oncology documentation of prognosis, 
treatment benefit and goals of care was poor. Less than half the patients were 
seen by palliative care. Initiatives to improve documentation and referral to 
palliative care are needed.

PURPOSE: The detection rate for significant prostate cancer of mMRI/TRUS fusion 
targeted biopsy versus saturation prostate biopsy was prospectively evaluated in 
men enrolled in active surveillance (AS) protocol.
METHODS: From May 2013 to January 2015, 40 men aged 66 years (median) with very 
low-risk PCa were enrolled in an AS protocol, and eligible criteria were: life 
expectancy greater than 10 years, cT1C, PSA below 10 ng/ml, PSA density <0.20, 
≤2 unilateral positive biopsy cores, Gleason score (GS) equal to 6, greatest 
percentage of cancer (GPC) in a core ≤50 %. All patients underwent 3.0-Tesla 
pelvic mpMRI before confirmatory transperineal saturation biopsy (SPBx; median 
30 cores) combined with mpMRI/TRUS fusion targeted biopsy (median 4 cores) of 
suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 4-5).
RESULTS: Ten out of 40 (25 %) patients were reclassified by SPBx based on 
upgraded GS ≥ 7; mpMRI found all the lesions predictive of significant PCa 
showing a false-positive rate equal to 5 %; on the contrary, mpMRI/TRUS targeted 
biopsy missed 3/10 (30 %) significant PCa characterised by the presence of a 
single positive core of GS ≥ 7 and GPC ≤ 5 %, suggesting that reduced number of 
targeted biopsies could miss small but significant PCa. Diagnostic accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of mpMRI in 
diagnosing significant PCa were 95.2, 100, 93.8, 83.4, 100 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mpMRI provided high diagnostic accuracy (about 95 %) in 
diagnosing clinically significant PCa, mpMRI/TRUS fusion targeted biopsy cannot 
replace SPBx at confirmatory biopsy of men enrolled in AS protocols.

Successive Governments of India have promised to transform India's 
unsatisfactory health-care system, culminating in the present government's 
promise to expand health assurance for all. Despite substantial improvements in 
some health indicators in the past decade, India contributes disproportionately 
to the global burden of disease, with health indicators that compare 
unfavourably with other middle-income countries and India's regional neighbours. 
Large health disparities between states, between rural and urban populations, 
and across social classes persist. A large proportion of the population is 
impoverished because of high out-of-pocket health-care expenditures and suffers 
the adverse consequences of poor quality of care. Here we make the case not only 
for more resources but for a radically new architecture for India's health-care 
system. India needs to adopt an integrated national health-care system built 
around a strong public primary care system with a clearly articulated supportive 
role for the private and indigenous sectors. This system must address acute as 
well as chronic health-care needs, offer choice of care that is rational, 
accessible, and of good quality, support cashless service at point of delivery, 
and ensure accountability through governance by a robust regulatory framework. 
In the process, several major challenges will need to be confronted, most 
notably the very low levels of public expenditure; the poor regulation, rapid 
commercialisation of and corruption in health care; and the fragmentation of 
governance of health care. Most importantly, assuring universal health coverage 
will require the explicit acknowledgment, by government and civil society, of 
health care as a public good on par with education. Only a radical restructuring 
of the health-care system that promotes health equity and eliminates 
impoverishment due to out-of-pocket expenditures will assure health for all 
Indians by 2022--a fitting way to mark the 75th year of India's independence.

Maternally expressed proteins function in vertebrates to establish the major 
body axes of the embryo and to establish a pre-pattern that sets the stage for 
later-acting zygotic signals. This pre-patterning drives the propensity of 
Xenopus animal cap cells to adopt neural fates under various experimental 
conditions. Previous studies found that the maternally expressed transcription 
factor, encoded by the Xenopus achaete scute-like gene ascl1, is enriched at the 
animal pole. Asc1l is a bHLH protein involved in neural development, but its 
maternal function has not been studied. Here, we performed a series of gain- and 
loss-of-function experiments on maternal ascl1, and present three novel 
findings. First, Ascl1 is a repressor of mesendoderm induced by VegT, but not of 
Nodal-induced mesendoderm. Second, a previously uncharacterized N-terminal 
domain of Ascl1 interacts with HDAC1 to inhibit mesendoderm gene expression. 
This N-terminal domain is dispensable for its neurogenic function, indicating 
that Ascl1 acts by different mechanisms at different times. Ascl1-mediated 
repression of mesendoderm genes was dependent on HDAC activity and accompanied 
by histone deacetylation in the promoter regions of VegT targets. Finally, 
maternal Ascl1 is required for animal cap cells to retain their competence to 
adopt neural fates. These results establish maternal Asc1l as a key factor in 
establishing pre-patterning of the early embryo, acting in opposition to VegT 
and biasing the animal pole to adopt neural fates. The data presented here 
significantly extend our understanding of early embryonic pattern formation.

Calorie restriction (CR) increases longevity in many species by unknown 
mechanisms. The circadian clock was proposed as a potential mediator of CR. 
Deficiency of the core component of the circadian clock-transcriptional factor 
BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT [aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear 
translocator]-like protein 1)-results in accelerated aging. Here we investigated 
the role of BMAL1 in mechanisms of CR. The 30% CR diet increased the life span 
of wild-type (WT) mice by 20% compared to mice on anad libitum(AL) diet but 
failed to increase life span ofBmal1(-/-)mice. BMAL1 deficiency impaired 
CR-mediated changes in the plasma levels of IGF-1 and insulin. We detected a 
statistically significantly reduction of IGF-1 in CRvs.AL by 50 to 70% in WT 
mice at several daily time points tested, while inBmal1(-/-)the reduction was 
not significant. Insulin levels in WT were reduced by 5 to 9%, 
whileBmal1(-/-)induced it by 10 to 35% at all time points tested. CR 
up-regulated the daily average expression ofBmal1(by 150%) and its downstream 
target genesPeriods(by 470% forPer1and by 130% forPer2). We propose that BMAL1 
is an important mediator of CR, and activation of BMAL1 might link CR mechanisms 
with biologic clocks.-Patel, S. A., Chaudhari, A., Gupta, R., Velingkaar, N.,

RATIONALE: Limitations in methods for the rapid diagnosis of hospital-acquired 
infections often delay initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy. New 
diagnostic approaches offer potential clinical and cost-related improvements in 
the management of these infections.
OBJECTIVES: We developed a decision modeling framework to assess the potential 
cost-effectiveness of a rapid biomarker assay to identify hospital-acquired 
infection in high-risk patients earlier than standard diagnostic testing.
METHODS: The framework includes parameters representing rates of infection, 
rates of delayed appropriate therapy, and impact of delayed therapy on 
mortality, along with assumptions about diagnostic test characteristics and 
their impact on delayed therapy and length of stay. Parameter estimates were 
based on contemporary, published studies and supplemented with data from a 
four-site, observational, clinical study. Extensive sensitivity analyses were 
performed. The base-case analysis assumed 17.6% of ventilated patients and 11.2% 
of nonventilated patients develop hospital-acquired infection and that 28.7% of 
patients with hospital-acquired infection experience delays in appropriate 
antibiotic therapy with standard care. We assumed this percentage decreased by 
50% (to 14.4%) among patients with true-positive results and increased by 50% 
(to 43.1%) among patients with false-negative results using a hypothetical 
biomarker assay. Cost of testing was set at $110/d.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, among ventilated 
patients, daily diagnostic testing starting on admission reduced inpatient 
mortality from 12.3 to 11.9% and increased mean costs by $1,640 per patient, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,389 per life-year 
saved. Among nonventilated patients, inpatient mortality decreased from 7.3 to 
7.1% and costs increased by $1,381 with diagnostic testing. The resulting 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $42,325 per life-year saved. Threshold 
analyses revealed the probabilities of developing hospital-acquired infection in 
ventilated and nonventilated patients could be as low as 8.4 and 9.8%, 
respectively, to maintain incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than 
$50,000 per life-year saved.
CONCLUSIONS: Development and use of serial diagnostic testing that reduces the 
proportion of patients with delays in appropriate antibiotic therapy for 
hospital-acquired infections could reduce inpatient mortality. The model 
presented here offers a cost-effectiveness framework for future test 
development.

Geriatric Assessment, Falls and Rehabilitation in Patients Starting or 
Established on Peritoneal Dialysis.

Individuals aged over 70 years at the time of starting dialysis have a varied 
and often challenging existence on dialysis. Canadian data suggest those 
starting dialysis between the ages of 75 and 79 years will have an average life 
expectancy of 3.2 years, while based on US data, patients can expect an average 
life expectancy of 25 months. A substantial proportion of these patients will, 
however, experience transient or permanent loss of personal independence within 
the first few months to years on dialysis. Preliminary data from patients 
recently started on peritoneal dialysis (PD) suggest patients and families 
adapt, but that the adaptation often involves limiting activities and altering 
the social role the patient has within the family. As data emerge, it will be 
possible to hypothesize whether this adaptation is beneficial in the long term, 
or whether these adaptations are permissive, allowing the patient to play a sick 
role leading to an accelerated transition to frailty and possibly death. Future 
research will hopefully inform us whether the functional dependency can be 
identified early and whether it is preventable. In the interim, repair rather 
than prevention is possible through rehabilitation. We therefore advocate that 
programs providing PD care consider the integration of protocols whereby 
patients may undergo formal evaluation to identify those who would benefit from 
walking or personal care aids, rehabilitation interventions, and, when needed, 
personal support.

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended 
increased aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 
men ages 45 to 79 years and women ages 55 to 79 years for whom benefit outweighs 
risk. This study estimated the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a 
statewide public and health professional awareness campaign to increase regular 
aspirin use among the target population in Minnesota to reduce first CVD events.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A state-transition Markov model was developed, adopting a 
payer perspective and lifetime time horizon. The main outcomes of interest were 
quality-adjusted life years, costs, and the number of CVD events averted among 
those without a prior CVD history. The model was based on real-world data about 
campaign effectiveness from representative state-specific aspirin use and event 
rates, and estimates from the scholarly literature. Implementation of a campaign 
was predicted to avert 9874 primary myocardial infarctions in men and 1223 
primary ischemic strokes in women in the target population. Increased aspirin 
use was associated with as many as 7222 more major gastrointestinal bleeding 
episodes. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated cost-saving results for both 
the male and female target populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Using current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, 
a state public and health professional awareness campaign would likely provide 
clinical benefit and be economically attractive. With clinician adjudication of
