CONCLUSION: In order to improve the health status in EMR countries, health 
policymakers should focus on the factors which lie outside the healthcare 
system. These factors are mainly associated with economic growth and development 
level. Thus, the economic stabilisation policies with the aim of increasing the 
productivity, economic growth, and reducing unemployment play significant roles 
in the health status of the people of the region.

The grand challenge in global health is the inequality in mortality and life 
expectancy between countries and within countries. According to Global Health 
2035, the Lancet Commission celebrating the 20(th) anniversary of the World 
Development Report (WDR) of 1993, the world now has the unique opportunity to 
achieve a grand convergence in global mortality within a generation. This 
article comments on the main findings and recommendations of the Global Health 
2035.

Policy and Management, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins 
University, Baltimore, MD (KDF).

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of external beam 
radiation therapy (EBRT) or newer radiation therapy (RT) modalities such as 
intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) or brachytherapy among older women with 
favorable-risk breast cancer.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of no RT, 
EBRT, and IMRT over 10 years. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of IMRT compared with EBRT under different scenarios to determine 
the necessary improvement in effectiveness for newer modalities to be 
cost-effective. We estimated model inputs using women in the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database fulfilling the Cancer and 
Leukemia Group B C9343 trial criteria.
RESULTS: The incremental cost of EBRT compared with no RT was $9500 with an ICER 
of $44600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The ICERs increased with 
age, ranging from $38300 (age 70-74 years) to $55800 (age 80 to 94 years) per 
QALY. The ICERs increased to more than $63800 per QALY for women aged 70 to 74 
years with an expected 10-year survival of 25%. Reduction in local recurrence by 
IMRT compared with EBRT did not have a substantial impact on the ICER of IMRT. 
IMRT would have to increase the utility of baseline state by 20% to be 
cost-effective (<$100000 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: EBRT is cost-effective for older women with favorable risk breast 
cancer, but substantially less cost-effective for women with shorter expected 
survival. Newer RT modalities would have to be substantially more effective than 
existing therapies in improving quality of life to be cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: The steady rise in life expectancy of our population leads to an 
exponential increase in proximal femoral fractures. The growing increase of 
comorbidities in these patients requires continuous development of modern 
implant systems for internal fixation of proximal femoral fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we enrolled 116 patients with 
pertrochanteric femoral fractures who were treated with a proximal femoral nail 
(Targon PF, Aesculap) over a period of 1 year. The indications for this implant 
system were set at unstable fracture types. Data of the operative and 
postoperative course were collected prospectively.
RESULTS: The average age of the 116 predominantly female subjects was 77±14 
years and the most commonly observed fracture subtype was 31-A1.2. The follow-up 
rate was 55 %. We observed a decrease in the postoperative modified Harris hip 
score of 22.7 %. The 1-year mortality was 21.6 %.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a low rate of perioperative 
complications and implant loss anda decline in patient mobility was typically 
observed within 1 year.

The fetal/neonatal hematopoietic system must generate enough blood cells to meet 
the demands of rapid growth. This unique challenge might underlie the high 
incidence of thrombocytopenia among preterm neonates. In this study, neonatal 
platelet production and turnover were investigated in newborn mice. Based on a 
combination of blood volume expansion and increasing platelet counts, the 
platelet mass increased sevenfold during the first 2 weeks of murine life, a 
time during which thrombopoiesis shifted from liver to bone marrow. Studies 
applying in vivo biotinylation and mathematical modeling showed that newborn and 
adult mice had similar platelet production rates, but neonatal platelets 
survived 1 day longer in circulation. This prolonged lifespan fully accounted 
for the rise in platelet counts observed during the second week of murine 
postnatal life. A study of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family 
proteins showed that neonatal platelets had higher levels of the anti-apoptotic 
protein Bcl-2 and were more resistant to apoptosis induced by the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL 
inhibitor ABT-737 than adult platelets. However, genetic ablation or 
pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-2 alone did not shorten neonatal platelet 
survival or reduce platelet counts in newborn mice, indicating the existence of 
redundant or alternative mechanisms mediating the prolonged lifespan of neonatal 
platelets.

A comparative analysis of two contrasting European approaches for rewarding the 
value added by drugs for cancer: England versus France.

York, YO10 5DD, UK, mike.drummond@york.ac.uk.

OBJECTIVES: Within Europe, contrasting approaches have emerged for rewarding the 
value added by new drugs. In Ireland, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, the 
price of, and access to, a new drug has to be justified by the health gain it 
delivers compared with current therapy, typically expressed in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained. By contrast, in France and Germany, the assessment of 
added benefit is expressed on an ordinal scale, based on an assessment of the 
clinical outcomes as compared with existing care. This assessment then 
influences price negotiations. The objective of this paper is to assess the pros 
and cons of each approach, both in terms of the assessments they produce and the 
efficiency and practical feasibility of the process.
METHODS: We reviewed the technology appraisals performed by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) relating to 49 anticancer drug 
decisions in the UK from September 2003 to January 2012. Estimates of the QALYs 
gained and incremental cost per QALY gained were then compared with the 
assessments of the Amélioration du Service Médical Rendu (ASMR) made by the 
Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) in France for the same drugs in the same clinical 
indications. We also undertook a qualitative assessment of the two approaches, 
considering the resources required, timeliness, transparency, stakeholder 
engagement, and political acceptability.
RESULTS: In the UK, the estimates of QALYs gained ranged from 0.003 to 1.46 and 
estimates of incremental cost per QALY from £3,320 to £458,000. The estimate of 
cost per QALY gained was a good predictor of the level of restriction imposed on 
the use of the drug concerned. Patient access schemes, which normally imply 
price reductions, were proposed in 45 % of cases. In France, the distribution of 
ASMRs was I, 12 %; II, 18 %; III, 24 %; IV, 18 %; V, 22 %; and 
uncategorized/non-reimbursed, 4 %. Since ASMRs of IV and above signify minor or 
no improvement over existing therapy, these ratings imply that, in around 40 % 
of cases, the drugs concerned would face price controls. Overall, the 
assessments of value added in the two jurisdictions were very similar. A 
superior ASMR rating was associated with higher QALYs gained. However, a 
superior ASMR was not associated with a lower incremental cost per QALY. There 
are substantial differences in respect of the other attributes considered, but 
these mainly reflect the result of institutional choices in the jurisdictions 
concerned and it is not possible to conclude that one approach is universally 
superior to the other.
CONCLUSIONS: The two approaches produce very similar assessments of added value, 
but have different attributes in terms of cost, timeliness, transparency and 
political acceptability. How these considerations impact market access and 
prices is difficult to assess, because of the lack of transparency concerning 
prices in both countries and the fact that market access also depends on a 
broader range of factors. There is some evidence of convergence in the 
approaches, with the movement in France towards producing cost-effectiveness 
estimates and the movement in the UK towards negotiated prices.

Self-rated health (SRH), a consistent predictor of mortality among diverse 
populations, is sensitive to health indicators and social factors. American-born 
Hispanics report better SRH than their foreign-born counterparts but 
simultaneously report poorer health indicators and have shorter life expectancy. 
Using a matched prospective cross-sectional design, we analyzed data from 631 
age-matched pairs of women, born in the United States or Mexico, enrolled in a 
cohort study based in Houston, Texas. Our first goal was to describe the 
relationships between SRH and health behaviors, physician-diagnosed chronic 
conditions, acculturation, and socioeconomic status (SES) by birthplace. Our 
second goal was to investigate the relative influence of SES, acculturation, 
health behaviors, and physician-diagnosed conditions in explaining expected 
differences in SRH between the two groups. Number of chronic conditions 
reported, particularly depression, more strongly influenced SRH than SES, 
acculturation, or reported health risk behaviors and the influence of birthplace 
is accounted for by these factors.

The effect of dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) on reed straw structural change at 
105 degreeC temperature was evaluated in this study. Various concentrations of 
NaOH (1% to 2.5%) were used for pretreatment of reed straw at 105 degreeC for 
10min. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy studies showed that 2% and 2.5% NaOH pretreated 
sample exposed more cellulose fibers compared with other treatments. The 
cellulose crystalline index was increased by the 1% to 2.0% NaOH treatments and 
slightly lowered by the 2.5% NaOH treatment due to destructing cellulose fibres. 
Two per cent NaOH pretreatment caused 69.9% lignin removal, whereas 2.5% NaOH 
pretreatment removed 72.4% lignin. Besides, reed straw, when pretreated at 2% 
and 2.5% NaOH, resulted 56.4% and 60.5% hemicellulose removal, respectively. 
However, the difference in removal of lignin and hemicellulose between 2% and 
2.5% NaOH treated reed straw was very marginal. In addition, very negligible 
increase of cellulose level was estimated, amounting 78.8% and 76.6% in 2.5% and 
2% NaOH-treated sample, respectively. Moreover, after 72 h, reducing sugar yield 
was 81.2% and 83.3% using enzyme loading of 15 FPU (g dry biomass)-' and 30 IU 
(g dry biomass)- and xylanase 4 FXU (g dry biomass)-1 from 2% and 2.5% NaOH 
pretreated reed straw, respectively. Reducing sugar yield was increased very 
marginally when NaOH concentration increased from 2% to 2.5% for reed straw 
pretreatment. Therefore, 2% NaOH is supposed to be effective for reed straw 
pretreatment at this mentioned condition.

The way we view old age varies depending on whether we are 60 or 80 and on the 
society in which we live.The traditional figure of the wise old man seems to 
give more and more credence to a negative representation of old age. High life 
expectancy raises the need to distinguish growing older from old age, maturity 
and the gaining of experience from the loss of memory and autonomy.

Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.

CONTEXT: The consequence of elevated body mass index (BMI) at adolescence on 
early adulthood mortality rate and on predicted life expectancy is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the investigation was to study the relationship 
between BMI at adolescence and mortality rate as well as the mortality trend 
over the past 4 decades across the entire BMI range.
DESIGN AND SETTING: The study included a nationwide longitudinal cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2 159 327 adolescents (59.1% males) born between 1950 
and 1993, who were medically evaluated for compulsory military service in 
Israel, participated in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: Height and weight were measured at age 17 years, and BMI was 
stratified based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-established 
percentiles for age and sex.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident cases of all-cause mortality before age 50 years 
were recorded. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess mortality 
rates and its trend overtime.
RESULTS: During 43 126 211 person-years of follow-up, 18 530 deaths were 
recorded. As compared with rates observed in the 25th to 50th BMI percentiles, 
all-cause mortality continuously increased across BMI range, reaching rates of 
8.90/10(4) and 2.90/10(4) person-years for men and women with BMI greater than 
the 97th percentile, respectively. A multivariate analysis adjusted for age, 
socioeconomic status, education, and ethnicity demonstrated a significant 
increase in mortality at BMI greater than the 50th percentile (BMI > 20.55 
kg/m(2)) for men and the 85th percentile or greater in women (BMI > 24.78 
kg/m(2)). During the last 4 decades, a significant decrease in mortality rates 
was documented in normal-weight participants born between 1970 and 1980 vs those 
born between 1950 and 1960 (3.60/104 vs 4.99/10(4) person-years, P < .001). 
However, no improvement in the survival rate was observed among overweight and 
obese adolescents during the same time interval. Significant interaction between 
BMI and birth year was observed (P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: BMI at adolescence, within the normal range, is associated with 
all-cause mortality in adulthood. Mortality rates among overweight and obese 
adolescents did not improve in the last 40 years, suggesting that preadulthood 
obesity may attenuate the progressive increase in life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: National Research for Health Systems (NRfHS) in Latin America and 
the Caribbean (LAC) have shown growth and consolidation in the last few years. A 
structured, organized system will facilitate the development and implementation 
of strategies for research for health to grow and contribute towards people's 
health and equity.
METHODS: We conducted a survey with the health managers from LAC countries that 
form part of the Ibero-American Ministerial Network for Health Education and 
Research.
RESULTS: From 13 of 18 questionnaires delivered, we obtained information on the 
NRfHS governance and management structures, the legal and political framework, 
the research priorities, existing financing schemes, and the main institutional 
actors. Data on investment in science and technology, scientific production, and 
on the socio-economic reality of countries were obtained through desk review 
focused on regional/global data sources to increase comparability.
CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the data gathered with a review carried out in 2008, 
we were able to document the advances in research for health system development 
in the region, mostly in setting governance, coordination, policies, and 
regulations, key for better functionality of research for health systems. 
However, in spite of these advances, growth and consolidation of research for 
health systems in the region is still uneven.

Surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma: why, when and what?

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a fatal cancer developing in the pleural 
cavity, linked to asbestos exposure. Various therapies have been tried in the 
past 50 years including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and 
more recently, targeted therapy. Radical surgery remains controversial in 
malignant pleural mesothelioma and two procedures have been offered in the past 
to obtain maximal cytoreduction: extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and 
pleurectomy/decortication (P/D). Despite growing evidence that EPP might be 
detrimental, many believe that radical surgery should still be part of 
multimodality therapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Recent 
evidence suggests that P/D is well tolerated and produces low mortality and 
morbidity. The role of adjuvant intrapleural therapies remains to be determined 
and evaluated in large prospective trials. Pleurectomy/decortication does not 
jeopardize the chance of having chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy either. Many 
now believe that it should be the default procedure in multimodality regimens. 
However, this remains to be proven in a large randomized trial. Palliative 
surgery still has an important role to play in mesothelioma, in establishing or 
refining diagnosis and in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life in 
many patients whose life expectancy is limited. Recent progress in molecular 
analyses and biomarkers should help with patient selection for surgery, 
immunotherapy and systemic therapies in the near future.

Increased life expectancy has led to the presentation of more complicated 
patients in old age for the replacement of the aortic valve. The emergence of 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) was considered as a significant 
breakthrough in the management of symptomatic, moribund patients suffering from 
aortic valve stenosis who had been rejected for surgical intervention. A novel 
technology often has a long journey from the point at which it is created to its 
every-day-use. It is now obvious that TAVI practice in multiple institutes 
around the world has gone beyond the evidence. Serious concerns have been raised 
questioning the current TAVI practice. Analysis of future TAVI use may assist 
clinicians and healthcare managers to understand and deploy this technology in 
accordance with the evidence.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and impact factors in lower-risk 
[International prognostic scoring system (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk] 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with recombinant human 
erythropoietin (rhEPO) alone or in combination with recombinant human 
granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (rhG-CSF).
METHODS: A total of 52 consecutive lower-risk MDS patients received subcutaneous 
injection of rhEPO alone or in combination with rhG-CSF at least 8 weeks, the 
rhEPO dose would be reduced slowly to stop or kept at minimum to maintain the 
response when the best efficacy achieved and maintained for 4 weeks. Their 
clinical features, efficacy, survival and the predictors of efficacy were 
analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The overall response rate was 51.9% (27/52) with 33.3%(9/27) achieving 
complete remission (CR) and 66.7%(18/27) achieving erythroid response (HI-E). In 
multivariate analysis, sEPO level (less than 500 U/L), BFU-E count (more than 
25/10⁵ BMMNC), intermediate and high doses rhEPO±rhG-CSF therapy were 
independent predictors of better response. The median therapy period was 8(2-45) 
months and the median efficacy duration was 37(6-94) months (38 months for CR, 
36 months for HI-E). Ten of the 27 responsive patients relapsed and 40% of them 
had disease progressions. Hemoglobin levels and karyotype affect response 
duration. Median overall survival was 47(6-114) months on a 37(6-114) months 
median follow-up. In multivariate analysis, ages (less than 60 years old), 
karyotype (good or intermediate) and response to rhEPO±rhG-CSF therapy may have 
a favorable survival impact on MDS.
CONCLUSION: rhEPO, alone or in combination with rhG-CSF, is a useful drug for 
the treatment of anemia in lower-risk MDS patients and has favorable impact on 
life expectancy.

Despite emerging evidence that access to greenspace is associated with longer 
life expectancy, little is understood about what causal mechanisms may explain 
this relationship. Based on social-ecological theories of health, greenspace has 
multifaceted potential to influence mortality but the potential alternative 
mediating pathways have not been empirically tested. This study evaluates 
relationships between access to greenspace, walking and mortality. Firstly, we 
test for an association between access to greenspace and self-reported levels of 
walking using a survey of 165,424 adults across England collected during 2007 
and 2008. Negative binomial regression multilevel models were used to examine 
associations between greenspace access and self reported number of days walked 
in the last month, in total and for recreational and health purposes, after 
controlling for relevant confounders. Secondly we use an area level analysis of 
6781 middle super output areas across England to examine if recreational walking 
mediates relationships between greenspace access and reduced premature mortality 
from circulatory disease. Results show clear evidence of better greenspace 
access being associated with higher reported recreational walking. There were 
between 13% and 18% more days of recreational walking in the greenest quintile 
compared with the least green after adjustment for confounders. Tests for 
mediation found no evidence that recreational walking explain the associations 
between greenspace and mortality. Futhermore, whilst the relationship between 
greenspace access and walking was observed for all areas, the relationship 
between greenspace access and reduced mortality was only apparent in the most 
deprived areas. These findings indicate that the association between greenspace 
and mortality, if causal, may be explained by mediators other than walking, such 
as psychosocial factors. Future research should concentrate on understanding the 
causal mechanisms underlying observed associations.

Epigenetic involvement in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: a mini-review.

of Internal and Specialized Medicine (DiBiMIS), University of Palermo, Palermo, 
Italy.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare human genetic disease that 
leads to a severe premature ageing phenotype, caused by mutations in the LMNA 
gene. The LMNA gene codes for lamin-A and lamin-C proteins, which are structural 
components of the nuclear lamina. HGPS is usually caused by a de novo C1824T 
mutation that leads to the accumulation of a dominant negative form of lamin-A 
called progerin. Progerin also accumulates physiologically in normal ageing 
cells as a rare splicing form of lamin-A transcripts. From this perspective, 
HGPS cells seem to be good candidates for the study of the physiological 
mechanisms of ageing. Progerin accumulation leads to faster cellular senescence, 
stem cell depletion and the progeroid phenotype. Tissues of mesodermic origin 
are especially affected by HGPS. HGPS patients usually have a bad quality of 
life and, with current treatments, their life expectancy does not exceed their 
second decade at best. Though progerin can be expressed in almost any tissue, 
when death occurs, it is usually due to cardiovascular complications. In HGPS, 
severe epigenetic alterations have been reported. Histone-covalent modifications 
are radically different from control specimens, with the tendency to lose the 
bipartition into euchromatin and heterochromatin. This is reflected in an 
altered spatial compartmentalization and conformation of chromatin within the 
nucleus. Moreover, it seems that microRNAs and microRNA biosynthesis might play 
a role in HGPS. Exemplary in this connection is the suggested protective effect 
of miR-9 on the central nervous system of affected individuals. This mini-review 
will report on the state of the art of HGPS epigenetics, and there will be a 
discussion of how epigenetic alterations in HGPS cells can alter the cellular 
metabolism and lead to the systemic syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the expected long-term health and economic outcomes of 
telaprevir (TVR) plus peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (PR), a regimen that 
demonstrated substantially increased sustained virologic response (SVR) compared 
with PR alone in adults with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 
compensated liver disease in the Phase III studies ADVANCE (treatment-naïve 
patients) and REALIZE (relapsers, partial responders, and null responders to 
previous PR treatment).
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of TVR+PR vs. PR in the United States (US).
METHODS: Patients first moved through the 72-week decision-tree treatment phase 
of the model and then entered the cyclic Markov post-treatment phase. Clinical 
data (patient characteristics, SVR rates, and adverse event rates and durations) 
were obtained from ADVANCE and REALIZE. Health-state transition probabilities, 
drug and other costs (in 2012/2013 US dollars), and utility values were obtained 
from the trials, published studies, and publicly available sources. Outcomes 
were discounted at 3% per year.
RESULTS: Regardless of treatment history, patients receiving TVR+PR were 
projected to experience fewer liver-disease complications, more life-years, and 
more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than patients receiving PR. In prior 
relapsers, TVR+PR was dominant, with lower total medical costs and more QALYs. 
For the other patient subgroups, incremental costs per QALY gained were between 
$16,778 (treatment-naïve patients) and $34,279 (prior null responders). 
Extensive sensitivity analyses confirmed robust model results.
CONCLUSIONS: At standard willingness-to-pay thresholds, TVR+PR represents a 
cost-effective treatment option compared with PR alone for patients with chronic 
genotype 1 HCV and compensated liver disease in the US. Future analyses are 
needed to compare TVR+PR with all existing HCV treatment options.

Infant mortality and life expectancy in China.

School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China (mainland).

BACKGROUND: It is reported that the infant mortality (IM) rate decreased rapidly 
in China and the life expectancy (LE) also had a high increase. Our objective 
was to determine the health status of the Chinese population by investigating IM 
and LE and their inter-relationship.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a literature review on the history and current 
status of IM and LE in China and other major countries, the relationship between 
IM, LE, and per capita gross national income (GNI) was investigated in 2013.
RESULTS: The decline in IM from 30% to 15% took China only 7 years, which was 
faster than in developed countries. The leading causes of infant death in China 
were perinatal diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, congenital 
anomalies, accidents, and signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions. Most 
under-5 mortality occurred during infancy (80%), particularly during the 
neonatal period (55%). LE was negatively correlated with IM (r=-0.921, P<0.001) 
and per capita GNI (r=0.778, P<0.001), while IM was negatively correlated with 
per capita GNI (r=-0.735, P<0.001). However, healthcare capabilities and per 
capita GNI in China are still below the level of developing countries. Some 
countries have a comparable IM and healthcare capabilities, but they have a much 
higher per capita GNI than China.
CONCLUSIONS: In China, IM has decreased and IE increased rapidly. However, they 
were not in parallel with the current economic development. Deviation of these 
data might be attributed to many factors. In-house surveys and hospital-based 
follow-ups should be carried out to better understand infant death.

Ultrasound subclinical markers in assessing vascular changes in cognitive 
decline and dementia.

Demarin V(1), Morovic S(1).

Aging is often associated with some cognitive impairment. Greater population 
life expectancy is one explanation for increased incidence of cognitive 
impairment cases. Large numbers of people with cognitive impairment and dementia 
is becoming one of the most important medical and social problems worldwide. 
Therefore, prevention of cognitive impairment is an imperative. Dementia 
includes a heterogeneous group of disorders, the most common being Alzheimer's 
disease and vascular dementia. Most cardiovascular risk factors, such as 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and 
smoking, are not exclusively risk factors for vascular dementia, but also for 
Alzheimer's disease. Early changes in the blood vessel wall can be detected by 
early ultrasound screening methods which allow us to detect changes before the 
disease becomes clinically evident. Intracranial hemodynamics can be assessed by 
transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), functional TCD with various functional 
tests, and TCD detection of cerebral emboli. Extracranial circulation (carotid 
and vertebral arteries) can be assessed by means of color Doppler flow imaging. 
Novel ultrasound technology enables non-invasive, portable, bedside detection of 
early vascular changes such as arterial stiffness, measurement of the 
intima-media thickness, pulse-wave velocity, flow-mediated dilation, or 
endothelial dysfunction in order to obtain information necessary to determine 
more closely the relation between vascular status and disease development, so 
that the evolution of cardiovascular disease can be prevented or at least 
postponed. Early disease detection enables in-time management, and studies have 
shown that careful control of vascular risk factors can postpone or even reverse 
disease progression.

Neurodegenerative disease is one of the greatest health crises in the world and 
as life expectancy rises, the number of people affected will continue to 
increase. The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, is a 
tauopathy, characterized by the presence of aggregated tau, namely in the form 
of neurofibrillary tangles. Historically, neurofibrillary tangles have been 
considered the main tau species of interest in Alzheimer's disease; however, we 
and others have shown that tau oligomers may be the most toxic form and the 
species responsible for the spread of pathology. We developed a novel anti-tau 
oligomer-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (TOMA) and investigated the 
potential of anti-tau oligomer passive immunization in preventing the toxicity 
of tau pathology in Htau mice. We injected pure brain-derived tau oligomers 
intracerebrally in 3-month-old wild-type and Htau mice and investigated the 
protective effects of a single 60 μg TOMA injection when compared to the same 
dose of non-specific IgG and found that TOMA conferred protection against the 
accumulation of tau oligomers and cognitive deficits for up to 1 month after 
treatment. Additionally, we injected pure brain-derived tau oligomers 
intracerebrally in 3-month-old wild-type and Htau mice and treated animals with 
biweekly injections of 60 μg TOMA or non-specific IgG. We found that long-term 
administration of TOMA was effective as a preventative therapy, inhibiting 
oligomeric tau and preserving memory function. These results support the 
critical role of oligomeric tau in disease progression and validate tau 
oligomers as a potential drug target.

Effective preservation techniques to prolong the shelf life of ready-to-eat 
oysters.

Costa C(1), Conte A, Del Nobile MA.

Foggia, Via Napoli, 25, I-71122, Foggia, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Oysters have a high commercial value but owing to their short shelf 
life are generally commercialized as raw material within very restricted market 
borders. A step-by-step optimization approach was used in this work to design 
ready-to-eat oyster packaging. In particular, six different steps were carried 
out in order to extend their shelf life.
RESULTS: The concentration of sodium alginate to realize a coating that was 
effective in terms of easy peeling and ability in preventing product dehydration 
was optimized. Coated oysters were packaged under different modified atmosphere 
(MAP) conditions to find the best MAP. Subsequently, to further promote product 
preservation, sodium acetate was selected as an effective antimicrobial agent to 
be applied by dipping treatment prior to coating. All preservation strategies 
singly tested were finally combined to assess the shelf life prolongation of 
ready-to-eat oysters.
CONCLUSION: Dipping in sodium acetate (10 g L⁻¹), coating with sodium alginate 
(40 g L⁻¹) and packaging under MAP (0:75 O₂:CO₂) represent the best conditions 
to guarantee a significant shelf life extension to about 160 h compared with 57 
h for unpackaged oysters.

In the USA, homicide is a leading cause of death for young males and a major 
cause of racial disparities in life expectancy for men. There are intense debate 
and little rigorous research on the effects of firearm sales regulation on 
homicides. This study estimates the impact of Missouri's 2007 repeal of its 
permit-to-purchase (PTP) handgun law on states' homicide rates and controls for 
changes in poverty, unemployment, crime, incarceration, policing levels, and 
other policies that could potentially affect homicides. Using death certificate 
data available through 2010, the repeal of Missouri's PTP law was associated 
with an increase in annual firearm homicides rates of 1.09 per 100,000 (+23%) 
but was unrelated to changes in non-firearm homicide rates. Using Uniform Crime 
Reporting data from police through 2012, the law's repeal was associated with 
increased annual murders rates of 0.93 per 100,000 (+16%). These estimated 
effects translate to increases of between 55 and 63 homicides per year in 
Missouri.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of duodenal stenting in palliation of 
patients with malignant pyloric and duodenal obstruction.
METHODS: The non-randomised prospective descriptive study was conducted at the 
Endoscopy Suite, Surgical Unit-IV, Civil Hospital, Karachi, from December 2007 
to November 2010. All patients presenting with inoperable ampullary, pancreatic 
or biliary cancers causing duodenal obstruction and patients with resectable 
malignancy but unfit for surgery were included. The procedure was carried out by 
a single expert endoscopist under local or general anaesthaesia as required. 
Boston Scientific stents of variable sizes were used. Follow-up was done at 1 
week, 1 month and 6 months. Data analysis was done using SPSS 15.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 159 (60%) males and 6 (40%) females were 
included in the study. The male-to-female ratio was 2:3. The overall age ranged 
from 25-80 years with a mean of 52.67 +/- 15.07 years. Primary diagnosis was 
pyloric carcinoma in 7(46.6%), carcinoma Gallbladder in 4(26.6%), Duodenal 
carcinoma in 3(20%) and carcinoma head of pancreas in 1(6.6%). Relief of 
symptoms were seen in 11 (73.3%), while complications were seen in 2 (13.3%). 
Stents were inserted with technical success in 14 (93%) patients. Clinical 
success was seen in 11 (73%), with a mean survival of 74.27 +/- 40.7 days 
(range: 15-180 days). No statistical significance was found when comparing the 
survival time with age, gender and diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Use of self-expandable metallic stents for gastroduodenal 
malignancies appears to be a feasible, safe and effective method, especially in 
those patients with limited life expectancy.

PREMISE: Applied Kinesiology (AK) is a diagnostic technique widely used within 
the Integrative Medical community. In essence, it posits that a question can be 
mentally held in a person's mind, sometimes while they are holding a substance 
like a vitamin, or a food sample, and by measuring relative muscular weakness an 
answer as to whether the substance or the condition represented by the question 
is good for that person can be obtained. This AK is presumed to have a 
diagnostic capability. That being presumed, this study asks the following 
questions: (1) Is there a difference in muscular strength when an individual 
holds a substance that is inimical to life processes (a poison solution), as 
compared to a substance that is essential for life (normal saline)? (2) Is this 
effect a transaction involving input from both the person being measured and the 
kinesiologist doing the measurement or is it only the person being measured? (3) 
As an extension of question 2, is the result the same when different 
kinesiologists take the measurement or when no kinesiologist is involved? (4) 
Does belief, expectation, gender, or time cognition play a role in determining 
response?
METHODOLOGY: To answer these questions, which would help to define the 
parameters of the AK process, 51 participants were tested during three trials 
each, first by one kinesiologist, then by another, and finally, with no 
kinesiologist present by grip strength indicated using a hand dynamometer. Grip 
strength being a self-administered AK test of relative muscular strength. For 
each trial, a pair of randomly numbered sealed vials, each pair in a randomly 
numbered plastic bag, were used as the objects of the trial. In each bag, one 
vial contained saline solution while the other was filled with a slightly 
smaller amount of saline solution to which had been added ionic hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride (NH3OH)(+), producing a toxic solution of 9mg/ml. Each trial 
consisted of a separate muscle test for each vial. All present at the trials 
were blind as to which vial contained the toxin. And all who prepared the vials 
were blind to the trials. The force used by the kinesiologists in each of their 
trials was measured via a pressure pad system. The hand dynamometer trials were 
conducted with no kinesiologist present.
RESULTS: Of the 151 sets of trials, the toxic vial was identified correctly in 
80 of them (53%), resulting in a one-tailed exact binomial P-value of .258. 
Results for two of the kinesiologists were almost exactly at chance. For the 
third kinesiologist, there was a one-tailed exact binomial P-value of .18 
(unadjusted for multiple testing). Results for the dynamometer were also almost 
exactly at chance. Testing whether there was a significant difference in 
proportions for whom the AK test worked based on belief about whether it would 
work resulted in non-significant χ(2) values of 0.6 (P = .439) for the trials 
with one kinesiologist and 2.222 (P = .136) for the hand dynamometer trials. The 
final variable examined was gender. While there was no significant difference in 
performance for males and females for the trials of the male kinesiologist or 
the hand dynamometer, the combined data for the two female kinesiologists did
