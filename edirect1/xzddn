Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral therapy are 
related to an increased risk of fracture. As a result of the developments in HIV 
treatment in recent years, life expectancy in HIV-infected patients has 
increased. Therefore, HIV-related musculoskeletal problems such as osteoporosis 
and avascular necrosis are more common currently. There are complex mechanisms 
in HIV-related osteoporosis. The loss of bone mineral density is particularly 
distinctive in the first months of the therapy. In this report, we present a 
54-year-old woman admitted to our clinic with right thigh pain for three months 
and diagnosed with a femoral neck stress fracture.

PURPOSE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are an 
indispensable lipid-lowering treatment option, but their cost-effectiveness has 
been questioned. This study aimed to perform a health economic evaluation of 
evolocumab versus placebo in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in China.
METHODS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was developed in decision 
analysis software to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. The simulation 
subjects could undergo non-fatal MI and/or stroke, or vascular or non-vascular 
death event. We integrated the Chinese population-specific demographics and 
event rates with the risk reduction of evolocumab based on the FOURIER trial 
and/or lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Age-related 
change, event costs and utilities were included from published sources.
RESULTS: At its current list price [33,748 Chinese yuan (CNY) annually per 
person], the ICER for evolocumab therapy was 927,713 CNY per QALY gained when 
integrating the FOURIER trial with absolute reduction of LDL-C. The probability 
of cost-effectiveness of evolocumab versus placebo was 1.96%, with a generally 
accepted threshold of 212,676 CNY per QALY gained. A reduction in acquisition 
price by approximately 70% (to less than 10,255 CNY annually) was needed to be 
cost-effective. Alternative scenario analyses of therapeutic benefit showed that 
the ICER for evolocumab in MI patients with uncontrolled familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH) was 187,736 CNY per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Evolocumab in patients with MI was not cost-effective based on the 
price in 2019 in China; however, treatment with evolocumab was more favorable in 
MI patients with FH.

We report 24 new records of the Brazilian cownose ray Rhinoptera brasiliensis 
outside its accepted geographic range. Sequencing of a 442-base pair portion of 
the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene for 282 Rhinoptera samples 
revealed eight records off the east coast of the USA and 16 from the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico. Both sexes of all life stages were documented in all seasons 
over multiple years in the Indian River and Lake Worth lagoons, Florida, 
indicating that their range extends further in the western North Atlantic than 
previously described.

ABSTRACTA pilot village volunteer programme (VVP) was implemented to produce new 
knowledge about the extent to which 24 trained village volunteers, taking an 
integrated One Health approach, could assist their communities by disseminating 
information on better agricultural and health practices. Just prior to the 
six-month pilot, the volunteers were mentored in a four-day training programme 
by local agricultural extension and public health experts. On returning to their 
villages, contacts and activities by volunteers with local community members 
were monitored using a CommCare application, enabling uploaded data to be 
accessed in real-time. The six volunteers in each village coordinated activities 
to address concerns of households. The VVP resulted in 960 actions (356 
agricultural; 604 health), helping in 97% of contacts, most (55-61%) by 
providing information and others by advising community members where appropriate 
information could be sourced. Focus group meetings with village leaders, 
community health staff and local extension officers supported continuation of 
the VVP through local funding. Six months after the pilot, volunteers were 
continuing their activities and assisting with other government measures, such 
as district programmes to reduce childhood stunting and improve waste disposal. 
Community empowerment using local human resources is sustainable and could be 
supportive in government programmes.

CONTEXT: Although high-quality research with patients and family members is 
needed to improve palliative care, difficulties in recruitment are often 
reported.
OBJECTIVES: The present article analyzes the authors' experiences in recruiting 
participants of two types of dyads for the study "Dy@EoL-Interaction at the end 
of life in dyads of parents and adult children". Recruitment challenges and 
factors found to improve recruitment are examined.
METHODS: Between February 2018 and November 2019, the research team cooperated 
with diverse inpatient and ambulatory palliative and hospice care providers to 
recruit both dyads. Cooperation strategies and adaptations were protocolled. 
Data on (non-)participation were recorded and analyzed using descriptive 
statistics.
RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 34.6% (dyad 1, terminally ill adult children 
with parents: 36.4%; dyad 2, terminally ill parents with adult children: 33.9%). 
In total, 82.2% of participants were recruited from inpatient settings. The 
research team has applied various strategies, such as public outreach activities 
and the extension of recruitment partners. The study protocol was adapted at an 
early stage to include single participants. Of all patients, 47.7% participated 
without their dyad partner. The main reason to exclude their family member was 
the patients' wish to protect them from extraburden.
CONCLUSION: The recruitment was more successful in inpatient than in ambulatory 
settings. The extension of recruitment partners was beneficial to recruit 
participants from ambulatory contexts. The inclusion of single participants was 
conducive as a great number of patients participated without their dyad partner. 
Sharing the obtained experiences can be helpful for future research planning.

(Kanclerz).

of Ophthalmology, University of Heidelberg, Germany (Yildirim, Khoramnia).

CONTEXT.—: The increases in overall life expectancy and in lens surgeries 
performed on younger patients have resulted in a significant increase in the 
anticipated duration of artificial intraocular lenses (IOLs) in the eye. Thus, 
the physicochemical properties of the IOL become a critical issue, and several 
types of postoperative IOL opacifications have been reported.
OBJECTIVE.—: To describe the microscopic characteristics of opacified IOLs. 
Glistenings and subsurface nanoglistenings are fluid-related phenomena 
developing mainly in hydrophobic acrylic IOLs and are associated with aqueous 
influx into the IOL matrix. Calcification presents in hydrophilic acrylic or 
silicone IOLs as deposits of hydroxyapatite or other phases of calcium. 
Snowflake degeneration is less common, and it manifests in older polymethyl 
methacrylate IOLs.
DATA SOURCES.—: PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were searched for the 
following keywords: intraocular lens, IOL, cataract surgery, 
phacoemulsification, opacification, glistening, subsurface nanoglistenings, 
calcification, snowflake degeneration. English-language articles published up to 
October 15, 2019 were included in the study. The manuscript contains mainly a 
literature review; however, it was supplemented with original investigations 
from the David J. Apple International Laboratory for Ocular Pathology.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Glistenings and subsurface nanoglistenings should be evaluated in 
a hydrated state and at room temperature; they manifest as microvacuoles sized 
from 1.0 to greater than 25.0 μm and less than 200 nm, respectively. 
Calcification deposits are situated on or underneath the surface of the IOL and 
can be stained with a 1% alizarin red solution or with the von Kossa method. 
Snowflake degeneration manifests as "particles" or "crystals," causing whitish 
IOL discoloration. Scanning electron microscopy or energy dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy may improve the diagnostic accuracy.

The quality and length of life of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are 
determined by a number of factors including the quality of healthcare received 
by patients, as well as access to drug programs dedicated to this particular 
disease. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of changes in the 
average life expectancy and mortality rate of the CF population in Poland 
between 2000 and 2018. Furthermore, we would like to evaluate access to 
healthcare services, including the drug program, guaranteed by public healthcare 
system, and funded by National Health Fund (NHF). The average life expectancy of 
patients with CF increased in the period in question from ca. 14.5 ± 7.6-24.5 ± 
8.9 years (mean ± SD, p = 0.0001). We have observed a drop in the number of 
deaths in paediatric age during that period. Despite the increase in life 
expectancy, the use of health resources in patients with CF, especially the drug 
program, is dramatically low. Considering the fact that in Poland there was no 
active countrywide CF registry, now it is possible to estimate the frequency of 
use of CF healthcare services in various provinces exclusively on the basis of 
database maintained by the Polish NHF.

Background: With the improved life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH), 
identifying vulnerable subpopulations at high mortality risk is important. 
Evidences showed that DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with mortality in 
non-HIV populations. Here, we established a panel of DNAm biomarkers that can 
predict mortality risk among PLWH.Methods: 1,081 HIV-positive participants from 
the Veterans Ageing Cohort Study (VACS) were divided into training (N = 460), 
validation (N = 114), and testing (N = 507) sets. VACS index was used as a 
measure of mortality risk among PLWH. Model training and fine-tuning were 
conducted using the ensemble method in the training and validation sets and 
prediction performance was assessed in the testing set. The survival analysis 
comparing the predicted high and low mortality risk groups and the Gene Ontology 
enrichment analysis of the predictive CpG sites were performed.Results: We 
selected a panel of 393 CpGs for the ensemble prediction model that showed 
excellent performance in predicting high mortality risk with an auROC of 0.809 
(95%CI: 0.767,0.851) and a balanced accuracy of 0.653 (95%CI: 0.611, 0.693) in 
the testing set. The high mortality risk group was significantly associated with 
10-year mortality (hazard ratio = 1.79, p = 4E-05) compared with low risk group. 
These 393 CpGs were located in 280 genes enriched in immune and inflammation 
response pathways.Conclusions: We identified a panel of DNAm features associated 
with mortality risk in PLWH. These DNAm features may serve as predictive 
biomarkers for mortality risk among PLWH.Abbreviations: AUC: Area Under Curve;

BACKGROUND: Although rehabilitation is recommended for terminal cancer patients, 
the specific components and methods of such programs are poorly documented. No 
studies to date have examined the effectiveness of rehabilitation for terminal 
cancer patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a new intervention 
for rehabilitation therapists, using the Op-reha Guide (Guide to Optimal and 
Patient-Centred Rehabilitation Practice for Patients in Palliative Care Units 
[PCUs]) in rehabilitation practice. This guide consists of recommended actions 
and attitudes for rehabilitation therapists and aims to optimise therapists' 
actions according to the patient's needs and condition. It shares goals with 
terminal cancer patients to maintain their activities of daily living (ADL).
METHODS: This study uses a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled trial 
(RCT) design with two parallel groups in PCUs where specialised rehabilitation 
will be routinely performed for terminal cancer patients by rehabilitation 
therapists. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to intervention (the Op-reha 
Guide) and control groups (usual rehabilitation). We will then conduct an 
observational study in PCUs that do not perform specialised rehabilitation for 
terminal cancer patients; this will be considered the usual care group, and the 
efficacy of usual rehabilitation will be quantitatively evaluated. Inclusion 
criteria are hospitalisation in PCU, European Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status of 2 or 3, and clinical estimation of life expectancy of 
3 weeks or more. Patients with severe symptom burden will be excluded. We 
hypothesise that the Op-reha Guide will be more effective in maintaining the ADL 
of terminal cancer patients hospitalised in PCUs than usual rehabilitation. The 
primary endpoint is defined as the change in (total) modified Barthel Index from 
baseline to Day 22. Quality of life will be a secondary endpoint. In total, 135 
patients will be recruited from 16 Japanese sites between July 2019 and December 
2021.
DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to evaluate the efficacy of specialised 
rehabilitation for terminal cancer patients hospitalised in PCUs, and will 
contribute to the evidence on the efficacy of implementing rehabilitation for 
terminal cancer patients.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare clonal disorder with multi-organ 
involvements and shortened life expectancy. To date, no curative treatment for 
SM exists. Cladribine (2-CdA) is a purine analogue showing activity against 
neoplastic mast cells and its use was found to be effective in some patients 
with SM. Nine patients (six males and three females) with advanced SM at median 
age of 63 years (range 33-67) who received at least one course of 2-CdA were 
included in a retrospective analysis. Study patients were classified as having 
aggressive SM (ASM; n = 7) and SM with an associated hematological neoplasm 
(SM-AHN; n = 2). The "C" findings were as follows: (1) absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) < 1 × 109/l (n = 1) and/or hemoglobin level < 10 g/dl (n = 4) and/or 
platelet count < 100 × 109/l (n = 4); (2) hepatomegaly with ascites (n = 4); (3) 
skeletal involvement (n = 2); (4) palpable splenomegaly with hypersplenism 
(n = 3) and (5) malabsorption with weight loss (n = 5). Treatment consisted of 
2-CdA at dose 0.14 mg/kg/day intravenously over a 2-h infusion for 5 consecutive 
days. Median dose per cycle was 45 mg (range 35-60). Median number of cycles was 
6 (range 1-7). Overall response rate (ORR) was 66% (6/9 pts) including three 
partial responses and three clinical improvements. ORR was 100% and 66% for 
SM-AHN and ASM, respectively. Median duration of response was 1.98 years (range 
0.2-11.2). At the last contact, five patients died, four have little disease 
activity, but remain treatment- free. 2-CdA seems to be beneficial in some 
patients with SM, however the response is incomplete.

Measurement, modeling and QALYs.

Over the past 30 years, a mainstay of health technology assessment has been the 
creation of modeled incremental cost-per-quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
claims. These are intended to inform resource allocation decisions. 
Unfortunately, the reliance on the construction of QALYs from generic utility 
scales is misplaced. Those advocating QALY-based lifetime modeled claims fail to 
appreciate the limitations placed on these constructs by the axioms of 
fundamental measurement. Utility scales, such as those created by the EQ-5D-3L 
instrument, are nothing more than multidimensional, ordinal scales. Such scales 
cannot support basic arithmetic operations. Interval scales can support addition 
and subtraction; ratio scales the further operations of multiplication and 
division. Those who advocate the construction of QALYs fail to appreciate that 
such an operation is only possible if the utility scale is unidimensional and 
has ratio properties with a true zero. The utility measures available do not 
meet these requirements. As we cannot produce meaningful utility values, the 
QALY is an invalid construct. Consequently, cost-per-incremental QALY claims are 
impossible to sustain and the application of cost-per QALY thresholds 
meaningless. As utility is a latent, unidimensional variable, the best a measure 
of utility could achieve would be unidimensionality and interval scaling 
properties. Where such measures are available, they could support claims for 
response to therapy. Consequently, there would be no need to continue 
constructing imaginary lifetime value assessment frameworks. Admitting that the 
QALY is a fatally flawed construct means rejecting 30 years of cost-per-QALY 
models.

We introduce a summary wellbeing measure for economic evaluation of 
cross-sectoral public policies with impacts on health and living standards. We 
show how to calculate period-specific and lifetime wellbeing using 
quality-adjusted life years based on widely available data on health-related 
quality of life and consumption and normative assumptions about three 
parameters-minimal consumption, standard consumption, and the elasticity of the 
marginal value of consumption. We also illustrate how these three parameters can 
be tailored to the decision-making context and varied in sensitivity analysis to 
provide information about the implications of alternative value judgments. As 
well as providing a general measure for cost-effectiveness analysis and 
cost-benefit analysis in terms of wellbeing, this approach also facilitates 
distributional analysis in terms of how many good years different population 
subgroups can expect to live under different policy scenarios.

Over the last decades, significant improvements in the clini- cal management of 
patients with cirrhosis have increased their life expectancy. Thus, indications 
for surgical procedures other than liver transplantation are becoming more 
frequent. However, patients with advanced liver disease are at high risk of 
perioperative morbidity and mortality. This is the consequence of multiple 
factors that include the presence of portal hypertension, alterations on 
hemostasis and coagulation, the immune dysfunction that entails an increased 
risk of infections, and the impaired synthesis of proteins that impacts on the 
nutritional status and the wound healing. Surgical outcomes are not only 
determined by the severity of the liver disease, but also by the type of surgery 
and the presence of other comorbidities. Different models to predict mortality 
have been proposed, including the MELD score, the Child-Pugh classification, the 
hepatic venous pressure gradient, and the Mayo postoperative mortality risk 
calculator, among others. Multidisciplinary committees including surgeons, 
anesthesiologists, hepatologists, critical care physicians and other specialties 
involved in each case, should assess individually the risk-benefit of the 
surgical procedure, also considering patient`s expectations and will.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency. Repurposing of 
approved pharmaceutical drugs for COVID-19 treatment represents an attractive 
approach to quickly identify promising drug candidates. SARS-CoV-2 main protease 
(Mpro) is responsible for the maturation of viral functional proteins making it 
a key antiviral target. Based on the recently revealed crystal structures of 
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we herein describe a multi-stage virtual screening protocol 
including pharmacophore screening, molecular docking and protein-ligand 
interaction fingerprints (PLIF) post-docking filtration for efficient enrichment 
of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. Potential hits, along with a 
cocrystallized control were further studied via molecular dynamics. A 150-ns 
production trajectory was followed by RMSD, free energy calculation, and H-bond 
analysis for each compound. The applied virtual screening protocol led to 
identification of five FDA-approved drugs with promising binding modes to key 
subsites of the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The identified 
compounds belong to different pharmaceutical classes, including several protease 
inhibitors, antineoplastic agents and a natural flavonoid. The drug candidates 
discovered in this study present a potential extension of the recently reported 
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors that have been identified using other virtual 
screening protocols and may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment.

During brain development, Uncoordinated locomotion 5 (UNC5) receptors control 
axonal extension through their sensing of the guidance molecule Netrin-1. The 
correct positioning of receptors into cholesterol-enriched membrane raft 
microdomains is crucial for the efficient transduction of the recognized 
signals. However, whether such microdomains are required for the appropriate 
axonal guidance mediated by UNC5 receptors remains unknown. Here, we combine the 
use of confocal microscopy, live-cell FRAP analysis and single-particle tracking 
PALM to characterize the distribution of UNC5 receptors into raft microdomains, 
revealing differences in their membrane mobility properties. Using 
pharmacological and genetic approaches in primary neuronal cultures and brain 
cerebellar explants we further demonstrate that disrupting raft microdomains 
inhibits the chemorepulsive response of growth cones and axons against Netrin-1. 
Together, our findings indicate that the distribution of all UNC5 receptors into 
cholesterol-enriched raft microdomains is heterogeneous and that the specific 
localization has functional consequences for the axonal chemorepulsion against 
Netrin-1.

Lung diseases have increasingly attracted interest in the past years. The 
all-known fear of failing treatments against severe pulmonary infections and 
plans of the pharmaceutical industry to limit research on anti-infectives to a 
minimum due to cost reasons makes infections of the lung nowadays a "hot topic." 
Inhalable antibiotics show promising efficacy while limiting adverse systemic 
effects to a minimum. Moreover, in times of increased life expectancy in 
developed countries, the treatment of chronic maladies implicating inflammatory 
diseases, like bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
becomes more and more exigent and still lacks proper treatment.In this chapter, 
we address in vitro models as well as necessary in vivo models to help develop 
new drugs for the treatment of various severe pulmonary diseases with a strong 
focus on infectious diseases. By first presenting the essential hands-on 
techniques for the setup of in vitro models, we intend to combine these with 
already successful and interesting model approaches to serve as some guideline 
for the development of future models. The overall goal is to maximize time and 
cost-efficacy and to minimize attrition as well as animal trials when developing 
novel anti-infective therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Although the Onodera's prognosis nutritional index (O-PNI) has been 
used to predict long-term life expectancy, its use to predict life expectancy 
within 12 weeks has not been discussed. In this study, we examined the 
usefulness of the O-PNI to predict short-term life expectancy in patients with 
end-stage gastric cancer.
METHODS: Blood samples from 425 patients who underwent surgery for gastric 
cancer at Toho University Omori Hospital from January 2001 to the end of 
December 2018 were analyzed. In 184 of 425 patients, a complete set of four 
blood sampling data were available at 12, 8, 4, and 1 week before death. The 
cutoff values and c-indices of O-PNI for predicting short-term life expectancy 
was calculated using the receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The shorter the life expectancy, the lower the O-PNI. For life 
expectancy of 8, 4, and 1 week, the optimal cutoff values for O-PNI were 40.4 
(sensitivity 80.1%, specificity 44.6%); 38.3 (sensitivity 80.2%, specificity 
54.1%); and 35.5 (sensitivity 80.4%, specificity 55.3%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, the O-PNI was below 40.4, 38.3, and 35.5 at 8, 4, 
and 1 week, respectively, before death, with 80% sensitivities. The O-PNI may be 
useful for predicting the short-term life expectancy in patients with end-stage 
gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The KEYNOTE-048 clinical trial revealed that 
pembrolizumab improved the overall survival time of patients with recurrent or 
metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) vs cetuximab plus 
chemotherapy (EXTREME regimen). The current study examined the cost 
effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
compared with the EXTREME regimen in patients with HNSCC from the perspectives 
of USA and China.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was implemented for patients with R/M 
HNSCC, and the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen was compared. Survival 
information was derived from the KEYNOTE-048 trial. The model was designed as a 
20-year time horizon, a 3-week cycle, and a 3% discount rate for costs and 
utilities. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value less than 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was considered cost effective in the 
USA and $27,538/QALY in China. We analyzed the uncertainty by performing one-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: From the base-case analysis, we found that the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy scheme had a lower cost and better efficacy compared with the 
EXTREME regimen in the USA. In China, the ICER of the comparison was 
$62,401/QALY. The ICER of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs the EXTREME regimen 
was $66,630/QALY in the USA and $90,538/QALY in China.
CONCLUSIONS: The observations suggested that treatment with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is a cost-effective strategy for 
patients with R/M HNSCC in the USA. However, the conclusion is the opposite for 
China: the EXTREME regimen is still a cost-effective choice.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Scalp melanoma is a subgroup of melanomas on the head and 
neck, historically associated with worst prognosis. Knowledge of the usual 
presentation of scalp melanoma can help to understand the reasons for the poor 
outcomes of treatment. This is the first publication to describe the clinical, 
histopathological and epidemiological profile of patients with scalp melanoma in 
a Latin American population.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed of all primary cutaneous melanoma 
seen by the A.C.Camargo Cancer Center between 2008 and 2018, using an electronic 
health records to access clinical and pathology data.
RESULTS: When compared to trunk and limbs, increasing age is expected for 
patients with scalp melanoma (10.865; CI (95%) = [8.303; 13.427]). Regarding 
risk of invasion, scalp melanomas have a higher chance to be invasive than in 
situ (OR = 1.783; CI (95%) = [1.196; 2.657]) and present with higher Breslow 
thickness (OR = 3.005; CI (95%) = [2.507; 3.601]). Scalp site was significantly 
associated with male sex (OR = 3.750; CI (95%) = [2.533; 5.554]), perineural 
invasion (OR = 13.739; CI (95%) = [5.919; 31.895]), ulceration (OR = 2.311; CI 
(95%) = [1.488; 3.588]), and mitosis (OR = 2.366; CI (95%) = [1.701; 3.292]), 
when compared to trunk and limbs melanoma.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, head and neck melanomas represented 14.9% of 
all melanomas, a frequency slightly lower than that described in the literature 
and the mean age of melanoma on the scalp found was lower than that reported in 
the literature. These results could be explained by the demographic 
characteristics of Brazil, which has a population with a lower life expectancy 
compared to the European and North American population. Scalp melanomas occurred 
in older men, were diagnosed with greater Breslow thickness and were associated 
with the presence of perineural invasion, mitosis and ulceration.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate effects on life expectancy (LE) 
of imaging-based ovarian surveillance after detection of incidental 
postmenopausal ovarian cysts, under different assumptions of patient age, 
comorbidity level, and cancer risk and detection.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate LE benefits. 
Hypothetical cohorts of postmenopausal women with simple ovarian cysts were 
evaluated, with varied age (66-80 years) and comorbidity level (none, mild, 
moderate, severe). For each cohort, imaging "follow-up" (2 years) and 
"no-follow-up" strategies were compared. Consistent with current evidence, 
increased cancer risk in patients with cysts was not assumed; however, incident 
ovarian cancers could be detected during follow-up. To estimate theoretical 
maximal LE gains from follow-up, perfect ovarian cancer detection and treatment 
during follow-up were assumed. This and other key assumptions were varied in 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Projected LE gains from follow-up were limited. For 66-, 70-, 75-, and 
80-year-old women with no comorbidities, LE gains were 5.1, 5.1, 4.5, and 3.7 
days; with severe comorbidities, they were 3.5, 3.2, 2.7, and 2.1 days. With 
sensitivity of 50% for cancer detection, they were 3.7 days for 66-year-old 
women with no comorbidities and 1.3 days for 80-year-old women with severe 
comorbidities. When cancer risk for women with cysts was assumed to be elevated 
(1.1 times average risk), LE gains increased only modestly (5.6 and 2.3 days for 
analogous cohorts).
CONCLUSIONS: Even in the circumstance of perfect ovarian cancer detection and 
treatment, surveillance of postmenopausal women (≥66 years of age) with simple 
cysts affords limited benefits, particularly in women with advanced age and 
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Various designs of total disc replacement (TDR) devices have 
been compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with favorable 
outcomes in FDA-approved investigational device exemption trials. The design of 
M6-C with a compressible viscoelastic nuclear core and an annular structure is 
substantially different than prior designs and has previously demonstrated 
favorable kinematics and clinical outcomes in small case series.
