view of the burden of aging.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the population aging burden in Macau, Hong Kong, and 
Singapore by including working-age population education and elderly health.
METHODS: The overall, working-age and old-age population and proportion, as well 
as the Old-Age Dependency Ratio of Macau, Hong Kong, and Singapore, were 
collected from the World Bank database. The life expectancy at 65 was extracted 
from the 2022 World Population Prospect. The tertiary education rate of the 
working-age population and the self-rated health status of the old-age 
population were retrieved from governments' statistical reports. We then 
calculated the Education-Health Adjusted Old-Age Dependency Ratio, a set of four 
equations showing the support of the working-age population on the old-age 
population, where OADRh_t and OADRuh_t represent the burden of healthy and 
unhealthy old-age population on the working-age population with tertiary 
education; similarly, OADRh_nt and OADRuh_nt indicate the burden placed on the 
working-age population without tertiary education by healthy and unhealthy 
old-age population. Lastly, for comparison with the conventional Old-Age 
Dependency Ratio, we generated the Weighted Education-Health Adjusted Old-Age 
Dependency Ratio.
RESULTS: Hong Kong has the greatest old-age population proportion and Old-Age 
Dependency Ratio, yet its growth rates are moderate and stable, ranging from 0 
to 4% and 0 to 6%, respectively. Macau and Singapore experienced sharper changes 
in old-age population proportion and the Old-Age Dependency Ratio, with Macau's 
Old-Age Dependency Ratio varying between -2.66 and 8.50% and Singapore's ranging 
from -1.53 to 9.70%. Three cities showed different patterns in four 
Education-Health Adjusted Old-Age Dependency Ratio indicators. In Macau, the 
OADRh_nt and OADRuh_nt increased by 0.4 and 6.2, while the OADRh_t and OADRuh_t 
decreased by 13.5 and 15.3 from 2004 to 2016. In Hong Kong, only the OADRuh_t 
fell by 9.4, and the other three increased from 2003 to 2015. In Singapore, the 
OADRh_nt and OADRh_t increased by 3.8 and 1.0, while OADRuh_nt and OADRuh_t 
decreased by 1.2 and 3.9 from 2007 to 2011. The Weighted Education-Health 
Adjusted Old-Age Dependency Ratios are all smaller than the conventional Old-Age 
Dependency Ratio in the three regions, particularly in Singapore. The Weighted 
Education-Health Adjusted Old-Age Dependency Ratio of Singapore was reduced by 
9.5 to 30.5% compared with the conventional Old-Age Dependency Ratio, that of 
Hong Kong reduced by 6.2 to 22.5%, and that of Macau reduced by 4.4 to 16.1%.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to compare the aging burden in Macau, Hong 
Kong, and Singapore in connection to working-age population education and 
elderly health. With the new assessment, the burden of population aging in three 
regions has been reduced, showing that improving the education of the 
working-age population and maintaining older people's wellbeing can assist 
authorities to deal with population aging, especially in Macau and Hong Kong.

Disease burden and risk factors of ischemic heart disease in China during 
1990-2019 based on the Global Burden of Disease 2019 report: A systematic 
analysis.

Fangshan District, Beijing, China.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the disease burden and risk 
factors of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in China, during 1990-2019, through a 
systematic analysis using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 report in 
order to provide first-hand information for primary and secondary prevention of 
IHD in China.
METHODS: Data on the rates of incidence, death, years of life lost (YLLs), years 
lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of IHD 
were obtained from GBD2019 to determine the disease burden and risk factors of 
IHD in China.
RESULTS: The rates of incidence, death, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs of IHD in China 
increased at different levels during 1990-2019. The annual rate of change in 
incidence, death, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs of IHD were 1.31%, 1.57%, 0.93%, 1.14%, 
and 0.94%, respectively. In 2019, the YLDs of IHD in Chinese women were higher, 
while the rates of incidence and death, YLLs, and DALYs were lower in Chinese 
women than in Chinese men. The disease burden of IHD had significant age 
differences, and people aged ≥70 years had the highest disease burden. A total 
of 24 risk factors were associated with the rates of death and DALYs of IHD, and 
the five most significant risk factors were high systolic blood pressure, high 
LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), smoking, ambient particulate matter pollution, and 
intake of a high-sodium diet. From 1990 to 2019, a high annual rate of change in 
IHD-related deaths and DALYs was observed due to ambient particulate matter 
pollution, high body mass index (BMI), and intake of a diet high in processed 
meat.
CONCLUSION: The results of the study revealed that the disease burden of IHD in 
China was on the rise, especially in people aged ≥70 years. The main disease 
burden of IHD in male patients was premature death and that in female patients 
was disability. Environmental, behavioral, and metabolic factors were considered 
the three main risks of the disease burden of IHD, with metabolic factors having 
the greatest impact. Therefore, periodic health check-ups and high-risk factor 
interventions for key populations should be strengthened from the grassroots 
level, which are conducive to further reducing the disease burden of IHD in 
China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the trial-based cost-effectiveness of the addition of 
a tailored digitally enabled exercise intervention to usual care shown to be 
clinically effective in improving mobility in the Activity and MObility UsiNg 
Technology (AMOUNT) rehabilitation trial compared to usual care alone.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: 300 people receiving inpatient aged and neurological 
rehabilitation were randomized to the intervention (n = 149) or usual care 
control group (n = 151).
MAIN MEASURES: Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated for the 
additional costs per additional person demonstrating a meaningful improvement in 
mobility (3-point in Short Physical Performance Battery) and quality-adjusted 
life years gained at 6 months (primary analysis). The joint probability 
distribution of costs and outcomes was examined using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The mean cost saving for the intervention group at 6 months was AU$2286 
(95% Bootstrapped cost CI: -$11,190 to $6410) per participant; 68% and 67% of 
bootstraps showed the intervention to be dominant (i.e. more effective and cost 
saving) for mobility and quality-adjusted life years, respectively. The 
probability of the intervention being cost-effective considering a willingness 
to pay threshold of AU$50,000 per additional person with a meaningful 
improvement in mobility or quality-adjusted life year gained was 93% and 77%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The AMOUNT intervention had a high probability of being 
cost-effective if decision makers are willing to pay AU$50,000 per meaningful 
improvement in mobility or per quality-adjusted life year gained, and a moderate 
probability of being cost-saving and effective considering both outcomes at 6 
months post randomization.

The human-pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans assembles two types of 
O-linked glycans on its proteins. In this study, we identified and functionally 
characterized the C. neoformans CAP6 gene, encoding an α1,3-mannosyltransferase 
responsible for the second mannose addition to minor O-glycans containing xylose 
in the Golgi apparatus. Two cell surface sensor proteins, Wml1 (WSC/Mid2-like) 
and Wml2, were found to be independent substrates of Cap6-mediated minor or 
Ktr3-mediated major O-mannosylation, respectively. The double deletion of KTR3 
and CAP6 (ktr3Δ cap6Δ) completely blocked the mannose addition at the second 
position of O-glycans, resulting in the accumulation of proteins with O-glycans 
carrying only a single mannose. Tunicamycin (TM)-induced phosphorylation of the 
Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was greatly decreased in both ktr3Δ 
cap6Δ and wml1Δ wml2Δ strains. Transcriptome profiling of the ktr3Δ cap6Δ strain 
upon TM treatment revealed decreased expression of genes involved in the 
Mpk1-dependent cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. Consistent with its defective 
growth under several stress conditions, the ktr3Δ cap6Δ strain was avirulent in 
a mouse model of cryptococcosis. Associated with this virulence defect, the 
ktr3Δ cap6Δ strain showed decreased adhesion to lung epithelial cells, decreased 
proliferation within macrophages, and reduced transcytosis of the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). Notably, the ktr3Δ cap6Δ strain showed reduced induction of the 
host immune response and defective trafficking of ergosterol, an immunoreactive 
fungal molecule. In conclusion, O-glycan extension in the Golgi apparatus plays 
critical roles in various pathobiological processes, such as CWI signaling and 
stress resistance and interaction with host cells in C. neoformans. IMPORTANCE 
Cryptococcus neoformans assembles two types of O-linked glycans on its surface 
proteins, the more abundant major O-glycans that do not contain xylose residues 
and minor O-glycans containing xylose. Here, we demonstrate the role of the Cap6 
α1,3-mannosyltransferase in the synthesis of minor O-glycans. Previously 
proposed to be involved in capsule biosynthesis, Cap6 works with the related 
Ktr3 α1,2-mannosyltransferase to synthesize O-glycans on their target proteins. 
We also identified two novel C. neoformans stress sensors that require Ktr3- and 
Cap6-mediated posttranslational modification for full function. Accordingly, the 
ktr3Δ cap6Δ double O-glycan mutant strain displays defects in stress signaling 
pathways, CWI, and ergosterol trafficking. Furthermore, the ktr3Δ cap6Δ strain 
is completely avirulent in a mouse infection model. Together, these results 
demonstrate critical roles for O-glycosylation in fungal pathogenesis. As there 
are no human homologs for Cap6 or Ktr3, these fungus-specific 
mannosyltransferases are novel targets for antifungal therapy.

PURPOSE: To analyse the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at diagnosis of 
patients with prostate cancer (PCa) according to tumour extension and urinary 
symptomatology and to explore factors associated with HRQoL.
METHODS: 408 Controls and 463 PCa cases were included. Eligibility criteria were 
a new diagnosis of PCa (cases), 40-80 years of age, and residence in the 
participating hospitals' coverage area for ≥ 6 months before recruitment. HRQoL 
was evaluated using the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, Mental (MCS) and 
Physical Component Summaries (PCS), and urinary symptoms with the International 
Prostate Symptom Score. HRQoL scores for all PCa cases, according to tumour 
extension and urinary symptoms, were compared with controls. In addition, 
information about lifestyles and comorbidities was collected and its association 
with low HRQoL (lower scores) were explored using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Overall cases had similar PCS score, but lower MCS score than controls. 
The lowest standardised scores for both PCS and MCS were reached by cases with 
severe urinary symptoms and a metastatic tumour [mean (SD); PCS: 41.9 (11.5), 
MCS: 42.3 (10.3)]. Having "below" PCS and MCS scores was associated with the 
presence of three or more comorbidities in the cases [aOR = 2.86 (1.19-6.84) for 
PCS and aOR = 3.58 (1.37-9.31) for MCS] and with severe urinary symptomatology 
[aOR = 4.71 (1.84-12.08) for PCS and aOR = 7.63 (2.70-21.58) for MCS].
CONCLUSION: The mental dimension of HRQoL at diagnosis of patients with PCa was 
lower than in controls, especially for cases with severe urinary symptoms and a 
metastatic tumour. Comorbidities and urinary symptoms were variables associated 
with the HRQoL of PCa cases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment satisfaction, level of anxiety, confidence 
about traveling with midazolam nasal spray (MDZ-NS), and health-related quality 
of life in patients with seizure clusters and their caregivers after repeated, 
intermittent use of MDZ-NS in the outpatient setting.
METHODS: We analyzed the psychosocial outcome data from a phase 3, open-label 
extension trial (ARTEMIS-2; P261-402; NCT01529034) in patients 12 years of age 
and older with seizure clusters on a stable regimen of antiseizure medications. 
Caregivers administered MDZ-NS 5 mg when patients experienced a seizure cluster. 
A second dose could be given if seizures did not terminate within 10 min or 
recurred from 10 min to 6 h. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 
(TSQM), the Intranasal Therapy Impact Questionnaire (ITIQ), and the Short 
Form-12 Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2) were self-administered by patients 
and/or caregivers at prespecified visits.
RESULTS: Of the one hundred and seventy-five patients enrolled in ARTEMIS-2, 161 
(92.0%) received ≥ 1 dose of MDZ-NS and had a post-treatment seizure-related 
assessment and were included in the Efficacy Evaluable Set in this analysis, 
with a total of 1,998 treated seizure clusters over a median duration of 
16.8 months. All TSQM scales showed improvement from the baseline of the 
double-blind ARTEMIS-1 trial (NCT01390220) to the last visit in ARTEMIS-2, 
indicating greater satisfaction with MDZ-NS across all domains, with a mean 
change from baseline of 8.8, 6.1, 4.3, and 6.2 for effectiveness (n = 135), side 
effects (n = 139), convenience (n = 139), and global satisfaction (n = 138), 
respectively. Change from baseline in TSQM scores generally increased with 
repeated MDZ-NS use. In both patients and caregivers, anxiety generally lessened 
with repeated MDZ-NS use, with a mean improvement in ITIQ scores in patients' 
anxiety since receiving MDZ-NS from 2.5 (n = 138) to 3.5 (n = 145) from visit 1 
to the last visit (and from 2.6 [n = 156] to 3.6 [n = 160] for caregivers), 
respectively. From visit 1 (screening and enrollment in ARTEMIS-2) to visit 10 
(after 16 seizure cluster episodes treated with MDZ-NS), the proportions of 
patients and caregivers who answered "strongly agree" or "agree" for confidence 
about traveling with an intranasal spray remained ≥ 79% and generally increased 
over repeated MDZ-NS use. Small positive mean changes in SF-12v2 scores from 
baseline to the last visit were observed in both patients and caregivers, 
respectively, for the domains of physical functioning (0.9, 1.1), role-physical 
(2.4, 0.3), bodily pain (1.7, 0.3), general health (0.6, 1.2), and 
role-emotional (2.1, 0.3), and in the physical health component (1.6, 1.0).
CONCLUSION: Patients and caregivers perceived MDZ-NS favorably, with improvement 
from baseline on perceived effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global 
satisfaction in the TSQM. This is supported by progressively lower anxiety and 
higher confidence levels about traveling with MDZ-NS over repeated intermittent 
use in the ITIQ. The positive mean changes observed in SF-12v2 scores from 
baseline to the last visit were small in magnitude. Limitations of this 
exploratory analysis include the open-label trial design and that these 
questionnaires have not been directly validated in epilepsy to identify 
clinically important changes; however, this does not mean these findings are not 
clinically meaningful. Overall, MDZ-NS is a socially acceptable drug device for 
outpatient treatment of seizure clusters that has the potential to improve 
quality of life and overall independence.

[Formula: see text]-Thalassemia is one of the dangerous causes of the high 
mortality rate in the Mediterranean countries. Substantial resources are 
required to save a [Formula: see text]-Thalassemia carriers' life and early 
detection of thalassemia patients can help appropriate treatment to increase the 
carrier's life expectancy. Being a genetic disease, it can not be prevented 
however the analysis of several indicators in parents' blood can be used to 
detect disorders causing Thalassemia. Laboratory tests for Thalassemia are 
time-consuming and expensive like high-performance liquid chromatography, 
Complete Blood Count (CBC) with peripheral smear, genetic test, etc. Red blood 
indices from CBC can be used with machine learning models for the same task. 
Despite the available approaches for Thalassemia carriers from CBC data, gaps 
exist between the desired and achieved accuracy. Moreover, the data imbalance 
problem is studied well which makes the models less generalizable. This study 
proposes a highly accurate approach for [Formula: see text]-Thalassemia 
detection using red blood indices from CBC augmented by supervised machine 
learning. In view of the fact that all the features do not carry predictive 
information regarding the target variable, this study employs a unified 
framework of two features selection techniques including Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) and Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD). The data imbalance 
between [Formula: see text]-Thalassemia carrier and non-carriers is handled by 
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic 
(ADASYN). Extensive experiments are performed using many state-of-the-art

BACKGROUND: Although the life expectancy of people living with HIV has 
increased, they are still often disconnected from society through stigma and 
discrimination. Peer support has been found to increase social support. Given 
the limited research on peer support from the providers' perspective, this study 
explored how peer supporters experience their roles and contributions in 
outpatient clinics (OPCs). Additionally, healthcare professionals' perceptions 
of working with peer supporters in OPCs were examined.  METHODS: This 
qualitative study included purposively selected peer supporters (n = 10) and 
healthcare professionals (n = 5) from five OPCs in Norway in 2020. In-depth 
interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in Norwegian or English, 
using interview guides. Interview transcripts were analysed in NVivo 12 using 
reflexive and collaborative thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The results show that peer supporters experience mutual support through 
emotional and honest interactions. Further, the peer supporters found it 
essential to negotiate with the service users about their preconception of HIV, 
confront their views through dialogue, and replicate positive experiences by 
being credible role models. The participants expressed that integrating peer 
support in the OPCs' usual care processes increased the prospect of equitable 
services. Quality of peer support and role clarity were identified as critical 
components. The results demonstrate that emotional and honest conversations 
promote support between peers and that peer supporters identify a need for a 
reframed understanding of HIV by modelling plausible alternative interpretations 
and coping experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to knowledge on how peer support can meet 
the needs of people living with HIV. Incorporating people living with HIV in the 
co-production and distribution of healthcare services may improve the knowledge 
and perspectives in healthcare services. However, the skill standards of peer 
supporters should be addressed when implementing peer support in usual care.

BACKROUND: The world population is aging with the prolongation of the expected 
life expectancy. With the increase in the elderly population in the World, 
successful aging and leisure activities gained importance. Leisure activities 
contribute to successful aging by supporting an active lifestyle.
AIM: This study was designed to examine the relationship between older adults' 
participation in leisure activities and successful aging indicators such as life 
satisfaction, happiness, mental well-being, depression, anxiety, and stress.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The sample of this one-group and pre-post experimental 
study consisted of 28 older adults. The data were collected using the 
Descriptive Information Form for the Older Adults, The Happiness, 
Depression-Anxiety-Stress, Satisfaction with Life, and Mental Well-being Scales. 
The older adults participated in activities such as bead stringing, rope tying, 
socks matching, rope knitting, chess, and checkers, according to their 
preferences, for 30-45 min daily for 7 weeks.
RESULTS: The Happiness Scale scores statistically significantly increased to 
24.39 ± 5.15 (P = 0.027 <0.05) at post-test after the activity. Similarly, Life 
Satisfaction Scale scores increased significantly to 16.54 ± 3.49 after the 
activity (P = 0.001 <0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease in 
Depression and Stress Scale scores (depression P = 0.035 <0.05; stress P = 0.011 
< 0.05); however, a statistically insignificant increase was seen in anxiety 
scores (P = 0.758 >0.05). A statistically insignificant increase was also found 
in the Mental Well-Being Scale post-test score (P = 0.103 >0.05).
CONCLUSION: Although leisure activities, effective in successful aging, have a 
significant effect on the happiness, life satisfaction, depression, and stress 
levels of older adults, they have no significant effect on the levels of anxiety 
and mental well-being. To maintain the positive effects of leisure activities, 
which are effective on success and aging in older adults, these activities can 
be included in the programs of institutions where people of this age group live.

The increasing life expectancy leads to more older adults suffering from 
infectious diseases. Vaccines are available against diverse infections such as 
influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and tetanus. However, vaccine 
acceptance is crucial for optimal preventive effect. The objective of the study 
is to perform a cross-country analysis of the perceptions and decision-making 
behaviour of older adults regarding vaccinations and their information needs. 
Focus groups with older adults were conducted in four countries: France, 
Hungary, Italy and the Netherlands. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. 
Demographic characteristics of participants were gathered with a questionnaire. 
Influenza and tetanus vaccines were commonly known, as was the disease 
influenza. On the contrary, the awareness of the vaccines against pneumococcal 
disease and herpes zoster were low. Participants also expressed a need for more 
information on vaccines, such as possible side effects, contra-indications and 
duration of protection, emphasizing that information is a condition for 
decision-making on vaccination. General practitioners were found to be the most 
important in information provision on vaccines. Perceptions on vaccines, such as 
effectiveness, side effects and safety, as well as perceptions on infectious 
diseases, such as severity, susceptibility and experiencing an infectious 
disease, played a role in the decision-making of older adults on vaccines. More 
awareness of the information needs among older adults with regard to vaccines 
should be raised among general practitioners and other healthcare providers. 
This requires appropriate knowledge about the vaccines among healthcare 
providers as well as communication skills to meet the information needs of older 
adults.

HealthCare's Community Health Improvement Team in St. Louis, Missouri.

Like many communities across the United States, St. Louis, Missouri, faces stark 
inequities in health outcomes, including wellness, quality of life, and life 
expectancy. These inequities are the result of social systems and policies that 
have robbed generations of St. Louisans of opportunity. BJC HealthCare's (BJC's) 
commitment to becoming a catalyst for community health by helping to eliminate 
health disparities led to the launch of its community health improvement 
strategy. This article details the community-driven and evidence-informed 
process that BJC used to create a multiyear, proactive approach to addressing 
the social and economic factors that are the root causes of health inequities. 
It examines areas of opportunity through which the strategy will drive change 
and explores lessons learned and promising practices for other healthcare 
institutions to consider as they advance health equity.

INTRODUCTION: Because of its low immunogenicity and associated risk of toxicity, 
sugemalimab is expected to reshape the first-line treatment landscape for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. However, it remains unclear whether 
the use of expensive sugemalimab is cost-effective in this population.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on the GEMSTONE-302 study to 
assess the efficacy of sugemalimab in combination with chemotherapy for 
first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Efficacy and safety data were entered, 
with costs and utility values derived from the literature, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated, and univariate sensitivity 
analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. We also 
considered cost-effectiveness in two different treatment regimen scenarios after 
disease progression.
RESULTS: Compared with the placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy, patients 
with metastatic NSCLC treated with sugemalimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy 
saw an increase of 0.56 life-years (LYs) and 0.41 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and patients with squamous NSCLC resulted in an ICER per QALY of 
$45,280.02. Patients with nonsquamous metastatic NSCLC resulted in an ICER of 
$45,294.15 per QALY. Univariate sensitivity analysis showed that disease-free 
survival utility had the greatest impact on the results. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed that when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for 
QALYs was $27,354/QALY, sugemalimab, in combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapy, was more cost-effective than the placebo.
CONCLUSION: From a Chinese health care system perspective, first-line treatment 
of squamous or nonsquamous metastatic NSCLC with sugemalimab plus platinum-based 
chemotherapy may have cost-effectiveness compared with placebo plus 
platinum-based chemotherapy at a WTP threshold of $27,354/QALY.

The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus has well-adaptive behavior to 
environmental changes, including human urbanization, and has an essential role 
as the main vector of important pathogenic arboviruses. This study aims to 
analyze the biology and life table of the Ae. albopictus populations collected 
from urban and peri-urban areas of Bogor, West Java, Indonesia under laboratory 
conditions. Mosquito eggs collection was carried out in urban and peri-urban 
areas using ovitraps. The observation of the life table experiment that followed 
the development of Ae. albopictus started from the emergence of the first 
individual to the last surviving individual. Several biological parameters 
comparing Ae. albopictus from two collection sites based on life table analysis 
were shown to be significantly different. Biting activity of all mosquitoes from 
urban and peri-urban areas showed a clear bimodal activity with morning peak at 
09:00-10.00 and evening peak at 16:00-17:00. Ae. albopictus from the urban area 
have higher fecundity, considerably longer lifespan, more gonotrophic cycles, 
and a higher net reproduction rate (R0) than Ae. albopictus from the peri-urban 
area. These findings will provide valuable information about the well-adapted 
Ae. albopictus in urban areas and assist in providing basic reproductive data to 
improve vector control and current surveillance strategies especially in the 
study area.

OBJECTIVE: Gabapentin can treat neuropathic pain syndromes and has increasingly 
been prescribed to treat nociplastic pain. Some patients with knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) suffer from both nociceptive and nociplastic pain. We 
examined the cost-effectiveness of adding gabapentin to knee OA care.
METHOD: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated Monte Carlo 
simulation of knee OA, to examine the value of gabapentin in treating knee OA by 
comparing three strategies: 1) usual care, gabapentin sparing (UC-GS); 2) 
targeted gabapentin (TG), which provides gabapentin plus usual care for those 
who screen positive for nociplastic pain on the modified PainDETECT 
questionnaire (mPD-Q) and usual care only for those who screen negative; and 3) 
universal gabapentin plus usual care (UG). Outcomes included cumulative 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime direct medical costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), discounted at 3% annually. We 
derived model inputs from published literature and national databases and varied 
key input parameters in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: UC-GS dominated both gabapentin-containing strategies, as it led to 
lower costs and more QALYs. TG resulted in a cost increase of $689 and a 
cumulative QALY reduction of 0.012 QALYs. UG resulted in a further $1,868 cost 
increase and 0.036 QALY decrease. The results were robust to plausible changes 
in input parameters. The lowest TG strategy ICER of $53,000/QALY was reported 
when mPD-Q specificity was increased to 100% and AE rate was reduced to 0%.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating gabapentin into care for patients with knee OA does 
not appear to offer good value.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide versus polyethylene glycol loxenatide 
(PEG-loxenatide) in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin, 
from a Chinese healthcare systems perspective.
METHODS: The study applied the Swedish Institute of Health Economics Diabetes 
Cohort Model to evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of 
once-weekly treatment of semaglutide at 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, versus 
PEG-loxenatide 0.2 mg, over a 40-year time horizon. Baseline cohort 
characteristics were collected from the SUSTAIN China trial. A network 
meta-analysis was conducted to obtain comparative treatment effects of 
once-weekly semaglutide and PEG-loxenatide based on two phase 3a clinical 
trials. Drug costs were sourced from the national bidding price of China. 
Outcomes were discounted at 5.0% per annum. One-way sensitivity analysis and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the uncertainty of 
the base-case results.
RESULTS: When compared with PEG-loxenatide 0.2 mg, the projections of outcomes 
over the 40-year time horizon in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on 
metformin showed that treatment with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg 
were associated with improved discounted life expectancy by 0.08 and 0.12 years, 
and improved discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.16 and 0.22 
quality-adjusted life-years, respectively. Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg were achieved at lifetime cost savings of 19,309 China Yuan (CNY) and 
10,179 CNY, respectively. Sensitivity analyses verified the robustness of the 
results.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of Chinese healthcare systems, treatment with 
once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide represents a dominant option versus 
PEG-loxenatide for patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin.
