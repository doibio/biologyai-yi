BACKGROUND: In the young patient, treatment of post-traumatic elbow arthritis 
remains difficult. Total elbow arthroplasty must be delayed for as long as 
possible. Therapy starts with nonoperative treatment. If this fails, operative 
options can be discussed.
TREATMENT AIM: The aim of surgery is to provide a functional range of motion 
with acceptable pain without obstructing future treatment options.
THERAPY: Patients with pain at terminal extension and/or flexion may benefit 
from arthroscopic or open debridement. Patients with advanced osteoarthritis and 
pain throughout the complete range of motion, who are too young for total elbow 
arthroplasty, are offered interposition arthroplasty or arthrodesis. Arthrodesis 
of the elbow leads to significant restrictions in daily life due to the complete 
loss of extension/flexion. Therefore, arthrodesis is only offered as treatment 
in exceptional circumstances. Interposition arthroplasty is a reasonable option 
for the young patient without significant bony defects, which may provide 
a stable, functional flexion arc with an acceptable pain level. Interposition 
arthroplasty preserves the revision options of re-interposition arthroplasty as 
well as the withdrawal to total elbow arthroplasty. Partial and total elbow 
arthroplasty are treatment options of elbow arthritis but are not subjects of 
this article.

This study used nationwide hip fracture data from Denmark and Sweden during 
1987-2010 to examine effects of (birth) cohort and period. We found that time 
trends, cohort, and period effects were different in the two countries. Results 
also indicated that hip fracture rates may increase in the not so far future.
INTRODUCTION: The reasons for the downturn in hip fracture rates remain largely 
unclear but circumstances earlier in life seem important.
METHODS: We ascertained hip fractures in the populations ≥50 years in Denmark 
and Sweden in national discharge registers. Country- and sex-specific 
age-period-cohort (APC) effects during 1987-2010 were evaluated by 
log-likelihood estimates in Poisson regression models presented as incidence 
rate ratios (IRR).
RESULTS: There were 399,596 hip fractures in SE and 248,773 in DK. 
Age-standardized hip fracture rate was stable in SE men but decreased in SE 
women and in DK. Combined period + cohort effects were generally stronger in SE 
than DK and in women than men. IRR per period ranged from 1.05 to 1.30 in SE and 
0.95 to 1.21 in DK. IRR per birth cohort ranged from 1.07 to 3.13 in SE and 0.77 
to 1.67 in DK. Relative period effects decreased with successive period in SE 
and described a convex curve in DK. Relative cohort effects increased with 
successive birth cohort in both countries but with lower risks for DK women and 
men and SE women born around the 1930s (age 75-86 years today and responsible 
for most hip fractures) partly explaining the recent downturn. Men and women 
born thereafter however seem to have a higher hip fracture risk, and we expect a 
reversal of the present decline in rates, with increasing hip fracture rates in 
both Denmark and Sweden during the upcoming decade.
CONCLUSIONS: Time trends, cohort, and period effects were different in SE and 
DK. This may reflect differences in general health as evident in known 
differences in life expectancy, healthcare organization, and prevention such as 
use of anti-osteoporosis drugs. Analyses indicate that hip fracture rates may 
increase in the not so far future.

Adenylation by testis-specific cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, PAPOLB/TPAP, is 
essential for spermatogenesis.

The testis-specific cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase PAPOLB/TPAP is essential for 
spermatogenesis. Although this enzyme is responsible for poly(A) tail extension 
of a subset of mRNAs in round spermatids, the stability and translational 
efficiency of these mRNAs are unaffected by the absence of PAPOLB. To clarify 
the functional importance of this enzyme's adenylation activity, we produced 
PAPOLB-null mice expressing a polyadenylation-defective PAPOLB mutant 
(PAPOLBD114A), in which the catalytic Asp at residue 114 was mutated to Ala. 
Introducing PAPOLBD114A failed to rescue PAPOLB-null phenotypes, such as reduced 
expression of haploid-specific mRNAs, spermiogenesis arrest, and male 
infertility. These results suggest that PAPOLB regulates spermatogenesis through 
its adenylation activity.

Surgical palliation of gastric outlet obstruction in advanced malignancy.

Potz BA(1), Miner TJ(1).

Alpert Medical School Brown University, Providence, RI 02906, United States.

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a common problem associated with advanced 
malignancies of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Palliative treatment of 
patients' symptoms who present with GOO is an important aspect of their care. 
Surgical palliation of malignancy is defined as a procedure performed with the 
intention of relieving symptoms caused by an advanced malignancy or improving 
quality of life. Palliative treatment for GOO includes operative (open and 
laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy) and non-operative (endoscopic stenting) options. 
The performance status and medical condition of the patient, the extent of the 
cancer, the patients prognosis, the availability of a curative procedure, the 
natural history of symptoms of the disease (primary and secondary), the 
durability of the procedure, and the quality of life and life expectancy of the 
patient should always be considered when choosing treatment for any patient with 
advanced malignancy. Gastrojejunostomy appears to be associated with better long 
term symptom relief while stenting appears to be associated with lower immediate 
procedure related morbidity.

Aires, PC C1430EFA, Argentina.

In 2015, 634387 million people (9% of the world's population) resided in Latin 
America (LA), with half of those populating Brazil and Mexico. The LA Dialysis 
and Transplant Registry was initiated in 1991, with the aim of collecting data 
on renal replacement therapy (RRT) from the 20 LA-affiliated countries. Since 
then, the Registry has revealed a trend of increasing prevalence and incidence 
of end-stage kidney disease on RRT, which is ongoing and is correlated with 
gross national income, life expectancy at birth, and percentage of population 
that is older than 65 years. In addition, the rate of kidney transplantation has 
increased yearly, with > 70% being performed from deceased donors. According to 
the numbers reported for 2013, the rates of prevalence, incidence and 
transplantation were (in patients per million population) 669, 149 and 19.4, 
respectively. Hemodialysis was the treatment of choice (90%), and 43% of the 
patients undergoing this treatment was located in Brazil; in contrast, 
peritoneal dialysis prevailed in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala. To date, 
the Registry remains the only source of RRT data available to healthcare 
authorities in many LA countries. It not only serves to promote knowledge 
regarding epidemiology of end-stage renal disease and the related RRT but also 
for training of nephrologists and renal researchers, to improve understanding 
and clinical application of dialysis and transplantation services. In LA, 
accessibility to RRT is still limited and it remains necessary to develop 
effective programs that will reduce risk factors, promote early diagnosis and 
treatment of chronic kidney disease, and strengthen transplantation programs.

Treating vertebral body fractures is challenging when there is relevant 
pre-existing spinal degeneration. Both vertebral body fractures and spinal 
degeneration are related to the physiological aging process. The increases in 
both are linked to increases in life expectancy. Several factors promote spinal 
degeneration and increase fracture risk, such as disc degeneration, spinal 
imbalance and osteoporosis. The main diagnostic and therapeutic challenge is to 
identify the sources of pain and to start appropriate therapy. A structured and 
advanced algorithm is then essential. Unstable fractures must always be 
stabilised. However, surgical strategy may be greatly influenced if there are 
also degenerative diseases, such as segmental decompression, multisegmental 
instrumentation or fusion, or complex reconstructive spondylodesis, including 
osteotomies. Notwithstanding this, the individual therapy concept has to be 
adapted to the demands and pathology of the individual patient.

Preventing Unnecessary Costs of Drug-Induced Hypoglycemia in Older Adults with 
Type 2 Diabetes in the United States and Canada.

BACKGROUND: The costs of drug-induced hypoglycemia are a critical but often 
neglected component of value-based arguments to reduce tight glycemic control in 
older adults with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: An economic (decision-tree) analysis compared rates, costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained associated with mild, moderate and severe hypoglycemic events 
for 6 glucose-lowering medication classes in type 2 diabetic adults aged 65-79 
versus those 80 years and older. The national U.S. (Center for Medicare 
Services) and Canadian public health payer perspectives were adopted.
FINDINGS: Incidence rates of drug-induced hypoglycemia were the highest for 
basal insulin and sulfonylureas: 8.64 and 4.32 events per person-year in 65-79 
year olds, and 12.06 and 6.03 events per person-year for 80 years and older. In 
both the U.S. and Canada, metformin dominated sulfonylureas, basal insulin and 
glucagon-like peptide1 receptor agonists. Relative to sulfonylureas, 
thiazolidinediones had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the 
U.S. and dominated sulfonylureas in Canada for adults 80 years and older. 
Relative to sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitors were cost-effective 
for adults 80 years and older in both countries, and for 65-79 year olds in 
Canada. Annual costs of hypoglycemia for older adults attaining very tight 
glycemic control with the use of insulin or sulfonylureas were estimated at 
U.S.$509,214,473 in the U.S. and CAN$65,497,849 in Canada.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing drug therapy for older type 2 diabetic adults through 
the avoidance of drug-induced hypoglycemia will dramatically improve patient 
health while also generating millions of dollars by saving unnecessary medical 
costs.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease is associated with high hospital mortality. 
Male gender, late age at onset, higher disability and the coexistence of 
cognitive impairment or depression have been suggested to be risk factors of 
death. Pneumonia and cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the mortality (causes of hospital admission and 
death) of Parkinson's disease patients in a tertiary hospital, as well as 
demographic and clinical characteristics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Identification of hospital admissions of Parkinson's 
disease patients that resulted in inpatient death between 2008 and 2014. 
Retrospective review of medical files and inclusion of patients with disease 
clinically confirmed by a neurologist. Assessment of causes of death and 
demographic and clinical characteristics of patients.
RESULTS: 1525 hospital admissions of Parkinson's disease patients were 
identified, of which 150 resulted in death. Of these, 52 patients met the 
inclusion criteria. Mean age at onset of Parkinson's disease symptoms was 66.8 
years (± 8.7) and mean duration of disease was 12.5 years (± 7.9). Sixty-five 
percent of patients were in stages 4-5 of the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Thirty-three 
patients (63%) had dementia and eleven (21%) had depression. Infections were the 
leading cause of death (respiratory in 63% of cases).
DISCUSSION: Similarly to literature, pneumonia was the leading cause of hospital 
death and most patients presented advanced disease stage and dementia. 
Contrarily to other studies, life expectancy was not reduced and cardiovascular 
diseases and trauma were not causes of death in our population.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Portuguese mortality study in Parkinson's 
disease. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death. Advanced disease stage and 
dementia were common features in these patients.

Publisher: Introdução: A doença de Parkinson está associada a elevada 
mortalidade hospitalar. O sexo masculino, o início tardio da doença, o grau de 
incapacidade e a coexistência de deterioração cognitiva ou de depressão têm sido 
apontados como fatores de risco. A pneumonia e as doenças cardiovasculares são 
as principais causas de morte. Objetivo: Explorar a mortalidade hospitalar 
(motivo de internamento e de óbito) dos doentes com doença de Parkinson num 
hospital terciário, assim como as características demográficas e clínicas. 
Material e Métodos: Identificação das admissões hospitalares dos doentes com o 
diagnóstico de doença de Parkinson entre 2008 e 2014 e seleção dos doentes 
falecidos. Revisão retrospetiva dos processos clínicos e inclusão dos doentes 
com doença confirmada clinicamente por um neurologista. Avaliação das causas de 
óbito, características demográficas e clínicas. Resultados: Identificámos 1 525 
admissões hospitalares de doentes com diagnóstico de doença de Parkinson, das 
quais 150 resultaram em óbito. Destes, 52 cumpriam critérios de inclusão. A 
idade média do início dos sintomas de doença foi 66,8 anos (± 8,7) e a duração 
média da doença foi 12,5 anos (± 7,9). Sessenta e cinco por cento dos doentes 
encontravam-se no estádio 4-5 na escala de Hoehn e Yahr. Trinta e três doentes 
(63%) apresentavam demência e onze depressão. As infeções foram a principal 
causa de morte (respiratória em 63% dos casos). Discussão: Ã semelhança da 
literatura, a pneumonia foi a principal causa de morte hospitalar e a maioria 
dos doentes apresentava estádio avançado de doença e demência. Contrastando com 
outros estudos, não se verificou diminuição da esperança média de vida e as 
doenças cardiovasculares e o traumatismo não foram causas de morte na nossa 
população. Conclusões: Apresentamos o primeiro estudo português de mortalidade 
na doença de Parkinson. A pneumonia é a principal causa de morte hospitalar. O 
estádio avançado de doença e a demência foram características comuns nestes 
doentes.

BACKGROUND: Overweight/obesity is associated with significant morbidity, 
mortality and costs. Weight loss has been shown to reverse some of these 
effects, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease 
(CVD).
AIM: To determine the potential monies available, from an English National 
Health Service perspective, for weight loss interventions to be cost-effective 
in the prevention of CVD.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed, populated with overweight/obese 
individuals from the Health Survey for England, aged 30-74 years, free of 
pre-existing CVD and with available risk factor information to calculate CVD 
risk. All individuals were free of CVD at baseline and, with each annual cycle, 
could transition to other health states of primary CVD, secondary CVD or death 
according to transition probabilities for a maximum period of 10 years, or until 
death. Utilities, costs and the effects of weight loss on CVD risk factors were 
applied. The potential monies available for CVD prevention strategies, provided 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio met UK arbitrary limits of between £20 
000 and £30 000, was determined.
RESULTS: Applying the effects of weight loss on CVD risk factors prevented 4 CVD 
events and saved 17 quality-adjusted life-years over 10 years per 1000 
individuals. £34 to £51 was available per person per year for up to 10 years 
when meeting the UK arbitrary limits.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual annual financial allowances for weight loss 
interventions to be considered cost-effective is relatively low; however, as a 
large proportion of the population is affected, wide cheap societal 
interventions are important.

Health inequality aversion parameters can be used to represent alternative value 
judgements about policy concern for reducing health inequality versus improving 
total health. In this study, we use data from an online survey of the general 
public in England (n = 244) to elicit health inequality aversion parameters for 
both Atkinson and Kolm social welfare functions. We find median inequality 
aversion parameters of 10.95 for Atkinson and 0.15 for Kolm. These values 
suggest substantial concern for health inequality among the English general 
public which, at current levels of quality adjusted life expectancy, implies 
weighting health gains to the poorest fifth of people in society six to seven 
times as highly as health gains to the richest fifth. Copyright © 2016 John

Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system 
affecting the substantia nigra in the midbrain. It accounts for 1.5% of the 
population in Europe over 60 years of age. Recent advances in the medical 
treatment of Parkinson's disease have improved the quality of life and life 
expectancy of the patients. However, it remains a debilitating disease. Spinal 
disorders are frequent in these patients, and as the population ages, more 
patients with Parkinson's disease are expected to require spinal surgery. Spinal 
surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease has been associated with an 
exceptionally high rate of complications; failures and reoperations are common, 
and patient outcomes are dismal.

Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is an important technique in 
the vascular surgeon's armamentarium, which has created a seismic shift in the 
management of aortic pathology over the past two decades. In comparison to 
traditional open repair, the endovascular approach is associated with 
significantly improved perioperative morbidity and mortality. The early survival 
benefit of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is sustained up to 3 
years postoperatively, but longer-term life expectancy remains poor regardless 
of operative modality. Nonetheless, most abdominal aortic aneurysms are now 
repaired using endovascular stent grafts. The technology is not perfect as 
several postoperative complications, namely endoleak, stent-graft migration, and 
graft limb thrombosis, can develop and therefore lifelong imaging surveillance 
is required. In addition, a postoperative inflammatory response has been 
documented after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms; the clinical 
significance of this finding has yet to be determined. Subsequently, the safety 
and applicability of endovascular stent grafts are likely to improve and expand 
with the introduction of newer-generation devices and with the simplification of 
fenestrated systems.

AIMS: New generation dual-source coronary CT (NGCCT) scanners with more than 64 
slices were evaluated for patients with (known) or suspected of coronary artery 
disease (CAD) who are difficult to image: obese, coronary calcium score > 400, 
arrhythmias, previous revascularization, heart rate > 65 beats per minute, and 
intolerance of betablocker. A cost-effectiveness analysis of NGCCT compared with 
invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was performed for these difficult-to-image 
patients for England and Wales.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Five models (diagnostic decision model, four Markov models 
for CAD progression, stroke, radiation and general population) were integrated 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NGCCT for both suspected and known CAD 
populations. The lifetime costs and effects from the National Health Service 
perspective were estimated for three strategies: (1) patients diagnosed using 
ICA, (2) using NGCCT, and (3) patients diagnosed using a combination of NGCCT 
and, if positive, followed by ICA. In the suspected population, the strategy 
where patients only undergo a NGCCT is a cost-effective option at accepted 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. The strategy of using NGCCT in combination with 
ICA is the most favourable strategy for patients with known CAD. The most 
influential factors behind these results are the percentage of patients being 
misclassified (a function of both diagnostic accuracy and the prior likelihood), 
the complication rates of the procedures, and the cost price of a NGCCT scan.
CONCLUSION: The use of NGCCT might be considered cost-effective in both 
populations since it is cost-saving compared to ICA and generates similar 
effects.

PURPOSE: To provide treatment guidelines for patients with long bone metastatic 
disease based on a systematic review of the literature and to propose an 
algorithm to guide orthopedic surgeons in decision-making for these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a computerized literature search in MEDLINE, 
EMBASE and Scopus for studies on patients with long bone metastases. We used the 
key words "long bones", "metastasis" and "treatment" for published studies that 
evaluated any treatment for long bone metastases. The articles found were then 
studied to determine the accuracy of surgical treatments for long bone 
metastases in every anatomic location, regardless of cancer type, stage and 
grade of the oncologic disease. Guidelines inferred from this literature review 
were collected, and an algorithm was proposed.
RESULTS: There was no clear evidence to support excision of a long bone 
metastatic lesion at the same surgical setting with internal fixation or 
prosthetic reconstruction. However, en bloc resection of an isolated bone 
metastasis may have a beneficial effect on survival. The life expectancy of the 
patients should be considered for any surgical treatment. Internal fixation 
preferably with reconstruction nails is indicated for meta-diaphyseal lesions; 
their rate of mechanical failure and complications ranges from 2 to 22 %. 
Prosthetic reconstruction is indicated for extensive lytic lesions or pathologic 
fractures in a meta-epiphyseal locations; their rate of mechanical failure and 
complications ranges from 3.7 to 35 %. Most of the internal fixation-related 
complications occur more than 1 year after treatment, in contrast to prosthetic 
reconstruction-related complications that may occur earlier.
CONCLUSIONS: Intramedullary nail fixation or prosthetic reconstruction should be 
chosen on the basis of the location of the lesion, the extent of bone 
destruction and the stability of the construct to outlast the expected life of 
the patient. Implant-related complication is similar but may occur earlier with 
prosthetic reconstructions.

BACKGROUND: Family history of breast cancer is associated with an increased risk 
of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) even in the absence of mutations in the 
breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1/2. We compared quality-adjusted 
survival after contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) with surveillance 
only (no CPM) among women with breast cancer incorporating the degree of family 
history.
METHODS: We created a microsimulation model for women with first-degree, 
second-degree, and no family history treated for a stage I, II, or III estrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive or ER-negative breast cancer at the ages of 40, 50, 60, 
and 70. The model incorporated a 10-year posttreatment period for risk of 
developing CBC and/or dying of the primary cancer or CBC. For each patient 
profile, we used 100,000 microsimulation trials to estimate quality-adjusted 
life expectancy for the clinical strategies CPM and no CPM.
RESULTS: CPM showed minimal improvement on quality-adjusted life expectancy 
among women age 50-60 with no or a unilateral first-degree or second-degree 
family history (decreasing from 0.31 to -0.06 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs)) and was unfavorable for most subgroups of women age 70 with stage III 
breast cancer regardless of degree of family history (range -0.08 to -0.02 
QALYs). Sensitivity analysis showed that the highest predicted benefit of CPM 
assuming 95 % risk reduction in CBC was 0.57 QALYs for a 40-year-old woman with 
stage I breast cancer who had a first-degree relative with bilateral breast 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Women age 40 with stage I breast cancer and a first-degree relative 
with bilateral breast cancer have a QALY benefit from CPM similar to that 
reported for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. For most subgroups of women, CPM has a 
minimal to no effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy, irrespective of family 
history of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Studies consistently find that supportive neighbourhood built 
environments increase physical activity by encouraging walking and cycling. 
However, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of investing in built environment 
interventions as a means of promoting physical activity is lacking. In this 
study, we assess the cost-effectiveness of increasing sidewalk availability as 
one means of encouraging walking.
METHODS: Using data from the RESIDE study in Perth, Australia, we modelled the 
cost impact and change in health-adjusted life years (HALYs) of installing 
additional sidewalks in established neighbourhoods. Estimates of the 
relationship between sidewalk availability and walking were taken from a 
previous study. Multistate life table models were used to estimate HALYs 
associated with changes in walking frequency and duration. Sensitivity analyses 
were used to explore the impact of variations in population density, discount 
rates, sidewalk costs and the inclusion of unrelated healthcare costs in added 
life years.
RESULTS: Installing and maintaining an additional 10 km of sidewalk in an 
average neighbourhood with 19 000 adult residents was estimated to cost A$4.2 
million over 30 years and gain 24 HALYs over the lifetime of an average 
neighbourhood adult resident population. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was A$176 000/HALY. However, sensitivity results indicated that increasing 
population densities improves cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: In low-density cities such as in Australia, installing sidewalks in 
established neighbourhoods as a single intervention is unlikely to 
cost-effectively improve health. Sidewalks must be considered alongside other 
complementary elements of walkability, such as density, land use mix and street 
connectivity. Population density is particularly important because at higher 
densities, more residents are exposed and this improves the cost-effectiveness. 
Health gain is one of many benefits of enhancing neighbourhood walkability and 
future studies might consider a more comprehensive assessment of its social 
value (eg, social cohesion, safety and air quality).

Dietary Polyphenols as Potential Remedy for Dementia.

Desai A(1).

Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. abhishrekdesai@gmail.com.

With increasing life expectancy as a result of better quality of life and 
improved health care, the incidence of aging related diseases and disorders is 
heading toward epidemic proportions. Dementia, a spectrum of neurological 
diseases associated with aging, is an increasingly prevalent disease. No cure 
exists yet for dementia; however, there are many potential candidates for 
treatment of dementia that merit more exploration. Polyphenols, which constitute 
one such class of compounds, are dietary agents that are globally found in 
commonly consumed food. Many processes that are associated with the 
pathophysiology of dementia can be modulated by polyphenols. Polyphenolic 
compounds can alleviate oxidative stress by acting as direct scavengers of free 
radicals and clearing superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and by increasing the 
level of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase. They also chelate 
metal ions to prevent free radical formation. Polyphenols can also combat 
inflammation by affecting transcription factors such as NF-κB. Some polyphenols 
may have the potential to inhibit excitotoxicity by regulating intracellular 
calcium ion concentration, inhibiting glutamate receptors and increasing 
glutamate reuptake at the synapse. The cognitive decline in dementia due to 
decreased availability of acetylcholine can also be countered by polyphenols 
that inhibit acetyl-cholinesterase activity. Taken together, these findings 
suggest that increasing the consumption of polyphenol rich food may alleviate 
the effects of dementia. Moreover, their effects on controlling multiple 
mechanisms that are associated with dementia may also prevent or slow down the 
onset and progress of this devastating disease.

Due to advances in earlier diagnosis and treatment, the life expectancy of a 
person born with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased. Therefore, more people with 
CF are becoming parents but the psychological understanding of CF has lagged 
behind advances in medical treatment; there is very limited applied 
psychological research on which parents and professionals can draw when 
considering issues of parenting in this context. This qualitative research 
explored how mothers and fathers with CF experience and manage the dual roles of 
being a parent and living with CF. The aim was to facilitate development of an 
understanding of experience rather than test existing theory. A qualitative 
methodology was chosen as it allowed participants to reflect openly on their 
individual experiences. Nine participants completed semi-structured interviews 
either in their own homes or a clinic base which examined parenting, CF and the 
interaction between the two roles. Four participants were male and five were 
female with an age range of 21-50. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was 
used to interpret the participants' accounts and generate super-ordinate and 
master themes. 'Being a parent on compressed time' was the super-ordinate theme 
which reflected the challenge of parenting within both a limited life trajectory 
and a complex treatment regime with daily adherence and time pressures. The 
findings have implications for parents with CF, those considering parenting and 
for health professionals working in CF services whose guidance needs to be 
grounded in an evidence-base. Further research is needed to explore the 
experiences of parents within different family structures, parents who have had 
a transplant and the perspectives of others in the wider system in which parents 
with CF are located.

Objective: To understand the epidemiology characteristics and survival status of 
HIV/AIDS patients with access to highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Ningbo 
during 2004-2015. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 
HIV/AIDS patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015. Life Tables were used to 
estimate survival rates, and Kaplan-Meier curve with Log rank test were used to 
describe the survival curves and the Cox proportional hazard model was used to 
determine predictors of mortality. Results: Of the subjects, the median age when 
starting HAART was 35 years (IQR: 27-45 years). Most of them were males, local 
residents, married, infected through heterosexual sexual transmission, and their 
baseline CD4 T cells counts were mainly ≤200 cells/μl, and most of them were at 
clinical stageⅠ(WHO). The cumulative survival rate was 96.75% for the first 
year, 92.36% for the fifth year, 91.87% for the seventh year and 90.02% for the 
tenth year. The risk of the mortality was 17.34 times higher for those aged >60 
years compared with those aged ≤20 years (95%CI: 2.11-142.71), 2.83 times higher 
for those at clinical stage Ⅳ(WHO) compared with those at clinical stageⅠ (WHO) 
(95% CI: 1.67-4.80) and 3.26 times higher for those with drug resistance 
compared with those without drug resistance (95%CI: 1.77-6.01). Blood 
transmission, lower CD4+ T cell level, BMI <18.5, unmarried were the risk 
factors for the mortality. Conclusions: The effect of HAART was obvious in the 
HIV/AIDS patients in Ningbo, their survival rate was high. The finding indicated 
that it is necessary to strengthen the health care for old population and health 
education about AIDS prevention and control, and conduct large scale screening. 
Early discovery, early diagnosis, early treatment and improving treatment 
compliancy are still the effective ways to reduce the mortality.

China has achieved an outstanding accomplishment in combating infectious 
diseases, which has contributed to health improvement and prolongation of life 
expectancy, and health development globally. Among strategies for combating 
infectious diseases, vaccination is a key component. However, immunization rates 
have fallen sharply as a result of false information, inconvenient access to 
vaccination, and distrust which together can lead to "vaccine hesitancy", 
eventually resulting in the risk of endemic vaccine-preventable disease. By 
analyzing the importance of vaccination and its determinants, it should be 
recognized that vaccination is necessary to protect children's health, and 
considered as a key national policy with forceful strategies for the control of 
vaccine-preventable diseases.

Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, 
China.

Objective: To examine the burden of disease(BOD)attributable to high-sodium 
diets in China in 2013. Methods: Data were extracted from the 2013 Global Burden 
of Disease Study for China to examine the BOD attributable to high-sodium diets 
in 2013, gender, and disease composition. Measurements for attributable BOD were 
population attributable fraction(PAF), deaths, standardized mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years(DALY)(not including Taiwan, China). An average 
world population age-structure for the period 2000-2025 was adopted to calculate 
age-standardized rates. Results: In 2013, deaths attributable to high-sodium 
diets accounted for 12.6% of all deaths and 14.5% of chronic disease deaths. 
Overall, 7.8% of deaths because of neoplasms, 25.2% of cardiovascular disease 
deaths, and 22.9% of chronic kidney disease deaths were attributable to 
high-sodium diets. A total of 1 176 553 deaths were attributable to high-sodium 
diets and the standardized mortality was 91.5/100 000, which was higher in men 
than in women(121.7/100 000 and 63.0/100 000, respectively). Overall, 22.759 
million DALYs were attributable to high-sodium diets. The DALY standardized rate 
was 1 588.0/100 000, which was higher in men than in women(2 189.7/100 000 and 
993.2/100 000, respectively). When compared by province, PAF in Xinjiang(25.0%), 
Qinghai(23.7%), Shanxi(23.2%), Tibet(22.1%)and Shandong(20.5%)was higher than 
other provinces. The standardized mortality in Xinjiang(239.4/100 000), 
Qinghai(238.9/100 000), Tibet(221.7/100 000), Shanxi(166.2/100 000)and 
Hebei(149.9/100 000)were higher than other provinces. The DALY standardized rate 
attributable to high-sodium diets was highest in Xinjiang(4 430.8/100 000), 
Qinghai(4 422.5/100 000), Tibet(4 021.4/100 000), Shanxi(2 816.6/100 000), and 
Hebei(2 624.9/100 000). Conclusion: The BOD attributable to high-sodium diets is 
a serious issue in China, particularly in men and in the northern provinces. 
Effective measures should be taken in northern provinces to reduce sodium 
intake.

Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, 
China.

Objective: To analyze the burden of disease attributed to high total 
cholesterol(TC)in 2013 in China. Methods: We used data from the 2013 Global 
Burden of Disease Study. The population attributable fraction was calculated to 
estimate the deaths and disability-adjusted life years(DALY)attributed to high 
TC. Disease burden was compared by age, gender, diseases and province(not 
including Taiwan, China). An average world population age structure for the 
period 2000- 2025 was adopted to calculate age-standardized rates. Results: In 
2013, high TC caused 298 952 deaths in China, accounting for 3.3% of total 
deaths, and caused 6 332 thousand DALYs. DALYs attributed to high TC were 
highest among the 50-69 years age group(3 165 thousand person years), accounting 
for 50.0% of the total attributed DALYs. The DALY rate in the ≥70 years age 
group was 2 053.3/100 000, which was 10.3 times that of 15-49 age 
group(198.6/100 000). DALYs among men were 4 431 thousand person years, which 
was 2.3 times higher than in women(1 900 thousand person years), and the 
age-standardized DALY rate among men was 590.6/100 000, which was 2.3 times 
higher than in women(257.1/100 000). DALYs attributed to high TC were mainly 
caused by ischemic heart disease(IHD; 5 572 thousand person years), accounting 
for 88.0% of the total attributed DALYs. Deaths and DALYs attributed to high TC 
were highest in Shandong(31 002 and 628 thousand person years for deaths and 
DALYs, respectively), Henan(27 398 deaths and 587 thousand person years, 
respectively), Hebei(25 744 deaths and 589 thousand person years, respectively), 
accounting for 28.1% of total attributed deaths and 28.5% of total attributed 
DALYs. The number of deaths and DALY were lowest in Macao(75 deaths and 1 
thousand person years, respectively)and Tibet(385 deaths and 10 thousand person 
years, respectively). The age standardized DALY rates were highest in 
Beijing(794.8/100 000), Hebei(732.7/100 000), and Jilin(709.1/100 000), and 
lowest in Shanghai(151.4/100 000), Zhejiang(168.1/100 000), and Hong 
Kong(182.0/100 000). Conclusion: The burden of disease attributed to high TC in 
2013 in China was mainly the result of the IHD it causes, with greater influence
