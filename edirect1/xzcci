The reproductive desires of HIV-positive men have been investigated far less 
than those of HIV-positive women, especially in the US. This qualitative study 
of a sample of 94 HIV-positive men in New York City who were in a relationship 
with a woman of reproductive age examined their reasons for wanting a child as 
well as the conditions under which they would feel ready to attempt conception. 
Participants felt a child would make them feel normal, give meaning to their 
lives, or make others in their life happy. Although they reported HIV-related 
concerns (i.e., horizontal or vertical transmission, reinfection, or shortened 
life expectancy), participants mostly discussed factors unrelated to HIV (e.g., 
finances, housing, incarceration, substance abuse, or relationships) as 
deterrents to acting on their desire to having a child. When providing 
information on safer conception, healthcare providers should be aware of the 
broad desires and factors informing HIV-positive men's reproductive goals.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease leading to increasing 
disability and costs. A literature review was carried out to identify MS costs 
and to estimate its economic burden in Spain. Areas Covered: The public 
electronic databases PubMed, ScienceDirect and IBECS were consulted and a manual 
review of communications presented at related congresses was carried out. A 
total of 225 references were obtained, of which 43 were finally included in the 
study. Expert Commentary: Three major cost groups were identified: direct 
healthcare costs, direct non-healthcare costs and indirect costs. There is a 
direct relationship between disease progression and increased costs, mainly 
direct non-healthcare costs (greater need for informal care) and indirect costs 
(greater loss of productivity). The total cost associated with MS in Spain is 
€1,395 million per year, and that the mean annual cost per patient is €30,050. 
Beyond costs, a large impact on the quality of life of patients, with an annual 
loss of up to 13,000 quality-adjusted life years was also estimated. MS has a 
large economic impact on Spanish society and a significant impact on the quality 
of life of patients.

Incremental net monetary benefit of ocrelizumab relative to subcutaneous 
interferon β-1a.

AIM: Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) impact the natural history of relapsing 
forms of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by reducing annual relapse rates and slowing 
disability progression. The effect of DMTs on indirect costs has not been 
consistently explored in cost-effectiveness studies thus far. The value to 
patients of an emerging DMT, ocrelizumab, was quantified in comparison to 
subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (IFNβSC) for the prevalent RRMS population with 
mild-to-moderate disability in the US, based on two Phase 3 trials, OPERA I and 
OPERA II, of ocrelizumab vs IFNβSC in RRMS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare disability 
progression as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and relapse 
outcomes over a 30-year horizon for ocrelizumab vs IFNβSC. Direct, indirect, and 
informal costs (2016 US dollars) and utilities for EDSS health states were 
obtained from the literature. Hazard ratios for disability progression and 
relapse rates were estimated from clinical trials. Value was assessed by 
calculating the net monetary benefit (NMB), defined as the monetary value of 
discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) minus total costs, where the 
value of a QALY was $150,000. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Ocrelizumab was associated with an incremental gain of 0.84 QALYs and 
cost savings of $287,713 relative to IFNβSC, resulting in an incremental NMB 
(INMB) of $413,611 per person over 30 years. The INMB increased by $151,763 for 
those initiating ocrelizumab at EDSS level 1 vs level 4. Influential parameters 
were QALY value, treatment costs, and disability progression; however, all 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the INMB for ocrelizumab relative to IFNβSC 
was ≥$300,000 per person.
CONCLUSIONS: Ocrelizumab provides greater value to RRMS patients compared with 
IFNβSC. Initiating ocrelizumab at lower EDSS levels leads to a greater 
cumulative value due to slower disability progression, which extends years with 
higher quality-of-life.

Our aim was to assess the inter links of the markers CD38 and ZAP-70 based on 
our materials, the attitude according to the disease stage, and to document 
which of them had leading meaning for prognosis and treatmend of the disease. In 
our study we have used flow cytometry for detection CD38 and ZAP-70+ markers 
expression. (58 patients to assessments their prognostic value in сhronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Correlation to Rai stages and relationships between 
this markers and outcome of therapy). We divided all patients in two groups 
based on level of ZAP-70+ cell and CD38+cells,(I group-patients) ZAP-70+ cells 
<20% CD38+<30% and ZAP-70+ cells >20% and CD38>30%,(II group) becaus our in 
investigation shows, that ZAP -70+ is very importance independent prognoctic 
marker as why in ZAP-70+ cases when its number was <20%, patients had favorable 
prognosis - the big part of them (13(40.6%) didn't need treatment during a long 
period, but which need the treatment was effective and this patients life 
expectancy was long (62 mounts). When ZAP-70 cells were>20% (II group n=26) 
prognosis was unfavorable, patients treatment was not effective and accordingly 
life expectancy was shorter (39 mounts). Despite CD38 positive or negative cells 
number. During research where compared were ZAP-70+ and ZAP-70- cases events 
treatment results and the research was held on the minimal residual disease 
existence, in ZAP-70+ positive cases treatment the remission obtained was always 
incomplete, and on the contrary, where the ZAP-70+ was negative - complete. In 
our study we didn,t reveal the importance of CD38 as a prognostic independent 
marker and there were not correlation between CD38+ and CD38- cells numbers in 
CLL prognosis. Because our study data confirm that ZAP-70 marker is more 
importance marker then CD38 and it has seriously prognostic significance, we 
think that information about ZAP-70 marker expression. Because our study data 
confirm that ZAP-70 marker has the advantageous prognostic meaning, we reckon 
the information on CLL disease debut on ZAP-70 market expression can be used not 
only for defining the aggressive process of the disease, but also in greater 
part, to define the refracterity towards the modern chemotherapy regimens.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy incidence rates among women living with HIV (WLWH) have 
increased over time due to longer life expectancy, improved health status, and 
improved access to and HIV prevention benefits of combination antiretroviral 
therapy (cART). However, it is unclear whether intended or unintended 
pregnancies are contributing to observed increases.
METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data from the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and 
Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS). Kaplan-Meier methods and GEE Poisson 
models were used to measure cumulative incidence and incidence rate of pregnancy 
after HIV diagnosis overall, and by pregnancy intention. We used multivariable 
logistic regression models to examine independent correlates of unintended 
pregnancy among the most recent/current pregnancy.
RESULTS: Of 1,165 WLWH included in this analysis, 278 (23.9%) women reported 492 
pregnancies after HIV diagnosis, 60.8% of which were unintended. Unintended 
pregnancy incidence (24.6 per 1,000 Women-Years (WYs); 95% CI: 21.0, 28.7) was 
higher than intended pregnancy incidence (16.6 per 1,000 WYs; 95% CI: 13.8, 
20.1) (Rate Ratio: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8). Pregnancy incidence among WLWH who 
initiated cART before or during pregnancy (29.1 per 1000 WYs with 95% CI: 25.1, 
33.8) was higher than among WLWH not on cART during pregnancy (11.9 per 1000 
WYs; 95% CI: 9.5, 14.9) (Rate Ratio: 2.4, 95% CI: 2.0-3.0). Women with current 
or recent unintended pregnancy (vs. intended pregnancy) had higher adjusted odds 
of being single (AOR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.42), younger at time of conception 
(AOR: 0.95 per year increase, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99), and being born in Canada 
(AOR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.55, 4.92).
CONCLUSION: Nearly one-quarter of women reported pregnancy after HIV diagnosis, 
with 61% of all pregnancies reported as unintended. Integrated HIV and 
reproductive health care programming is required to better support WLWH to 
optimize pregnancy planning and outcomes and to prevent unintended pregnancy.

The traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, provides insights and practical 
solutions towards a healthy life style. Rasayana is a branch of Ayurveda known 
for preserving and promoting health, enhancing the quality of life and delaying 
the aging process. In the traditional knowledge, the Rasayana herb, Chlorophytum 
borivilianum (C. borivilanum) is regarded as a general health promoting tonic 
that delays aging and increases lifespan, cognitive function and physical 
strength. Aging is a complex and multifactorial physiological phenomenon that 
manifests itself over a wide range of biological systems, tissues, and 
functions. Longevity is an obvious marker of physiological aging. Simple model 
systems such as the single-cell budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. 
cerevisiae) and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) are widely 
used to study the aging process and longevity. Here, we show that a 
polysaccharide fraction obtained from C. borivilianum increases the lifespan of 
S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, using an automated screening platform 
(ChronoscreenTM). Chemical analysis of this extract revealed a low molecular 
weight polysaccharide of 1000 Da, predominantly comprising Glu1→6Glu linkage. 
This polysaccharide showed significant dose-dependent extension of the median 
lifespan of S. cerevisiae by up to 41% and of the median lifespan of C. elegans 
by up to 10%. Taking cue from these results and the traditionally described 
benefits of Rasayanas on skin rejuvenation, we tested in vitro the 
polysaccharide for potential skin benefits. In a keratinocyte culture, we 
observed that this polysaccharide increased cell proliferation significantly, 
and induced synthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA), a well-known extracellular matrix 
component. Furthermore, when added to culture medium of human reconstructed 
epidermis, we observed an enhanced production of epidermal markers, e.g. CD44 
and HA that are otherwise diminished in aged skin. Together, these results 
suggest that in addition to life-span extension of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, 
a polysaccharide from the Rasayana herb, C. borivilianum may have beneficial 
effects on skin aging parameters.

Head midline position for preventing the occurrence or extension of germinal 
matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants.

Update in
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Jul 7;7:CD012362.

BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is known to constitute the major risk factor for 
development of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH). Head 
position may affect cerebral hemodynamics and thus may be involved indirectly in 
development of GM-IVH. Turning the head toward one side may functionally occlude 
jugular venous drainage on the ipsilateral side while increasing intracranial 
pressure and cerebral blood volume. Thus, it has been suggested that cerebral 
venous pressure is reduced and hydrostatic brain drainage improved if the 
patient is in supine midline position with the bed tilted 30°. The midline 
position might be achieved in the supine position and, with the use of physical 
aids, in the lateral position as well. Midline position should be kept, at least 
when the incidence of GM-IVH is greatest, that is, during the first two to three 
days of life.
OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To assess whether head midline position is more 
effective than any other head position for preventing or extending germinal 
matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants born at ≤ 32 weeks' gestational 
age. Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses regarding gestational 
age, birth weight, intubated versus not intubated, and with or without GM-IVH at 
trial entry.
SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal 
Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to September 19, 2016), 
Embase (1980 to September 19,.2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to September 19, 2016). We searched 
clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of 
retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical controlled trials, quasi-randomized 
trials, and cluster-randomized controlled trials comparing placing very preterm 
infants in a head midline position versus placing them in a prone or lateral 
decubitus position, or undertaking a strategy of regular position change, or 
having no prespecified position. We included trials enrolling infants with 
existing GM-IVH and planned to assess extension of hemorrhage in a subgroup of 
infants. We planned to analyze horizontal (flat) versus head elevated positions 
separately for all body positions.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal 
Review Group. For each of the included trials, two review authors independently 
extracted data (e.g., number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, 
initiation and duration of head midline position, co-intervention with 
horizontal vs head elevated position, use of physical aids to maintain head 
position) and assessed risk of bias (e.g., adequacy of randomization, blinding, 
completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are 
GM-IVH , severe IVH, and neonatal death.
MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 2696 references. Two review authors 
independently assessed all references for inclusion. Two randomized controlled 
trials, for a total of 110 infants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. 
Both trials compared supine midline head position with the bed at 0° versus 
supine head rotated 90° with the bed at 0°. We found no trials that compared 
supine versus prone midline head position, and no trials that compared effects 
of head tilting. We found no significant differences in rates of GM-IVH (typical 
risk ratio [RR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 2.35; typical risk 
difference [RD] 0.03, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.18; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 0% 
for RR and I2 = 0% for RD), severe IVH (typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.98; 
typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.10; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 0% for RR 
and I2 = 0% for RD), and neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.16 to 
1.65; typical RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.05; two studies, 110 infants; I2 = 28% 
for RR and I2 = 44% for RD). Among secondary outcomes, we found no significant 
differences in terms of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (one study; RR 3.25, 
95% CI 0.14 to 76.01; RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.15), retinopathy of prematurity 
(one study; RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 6.11; RD 0.25, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.53), and 
severe retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 24.14; RD 
0.09, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.26). None of the included trials reported on the other 
specified outcomes of this review (i.e., cerebellar hemorrhage, brain magnetic 
resonance imaging abnormalities, impairment in cerebral hemodynamics, long-term 
neurodevelopmental outcomes, and major neurodevelopmental disability). The 
quality of evidence supporting these findings is limited owing to the 
imprecision of the estimates. We identified no ongoing studies.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the imprecision of the estimate, results of this 
systematic review are consistent with beneficial or detrimental effects of a 
supine head midline position versus a lateral position and do not provide a 
definitive answer to the review question.

[Nutrition of Polymorbid Patients - Data or Opinions?].

[Article in German]

Plauth M.

Polymorbidity and old age are rather the rule than the exception in hospitalised 
patients. Malnutrition is common in such patients and should be identified by 
appropriate screening and assessment measures in order to devise a nutrition 
plan and act accordingly. Unlike in the UK or The Netherlands, malnutrition 
screening and nutrition teams are not mandatory for German hospitals. 
Malnutrition and, in particular, sarcopenia are indicators of a nutrition 
associated risk or increased morbidity and mortality. Malnutrition can affect 
patients of any medical discipline and, therefore, is managed most efficiently 
by the interdisciplinary and multiprofessional nutrition team. By this approach 
goal directed nutrition therapy can improve morbidity and mortality of 
hospitalised patients.

BACKGROUND: Most modern societies undergo rapid population aging. The rise in 
life expectancy, nevertheless, is not accompanied, to date, by the same 
increment of healthspan. Efforts to increase healthspan by means of supplements 
and pharmaceuticals targeting aging-related pathologies are presently in 
spotlight of a new branch in geriatric medicine, geroscience, postulating that 
aging could be manipulated in such a way that will in parallel allow delay the 
onset of all age-associated chronic disorders.
DISCUSSION: Currently, the concept of the "longevity dividend" has been 
developed pointed out that the extension of healthspan by slowing the rate of 
aging is the most efficient way to combat various aging-related chronic 
illnesses and disabling conditions than combating them one by one, what is the 
present-day approach in a generally accepted disease-based paradigm. The further 
elaboration of pharmaceuticals specifically targeted at age-associated disorders 
(commonly referred to as 'anti-aging drugs') is currently one of the most 
extensively developed fields in modern biogerontology. Some classes of 
chemically synthesized compounds and nutraceuticals such as calorie restriction 
mimetics, autophagy inductors, senolytics and others have been identified as 
having potential for anti-aging intervention through their possible effects on 
basic processes underlying aging. In modern pharmaceutical industry, development 
of new classes of anti-aging medicines is apparently one of the most hopeful 
directions since potential target group may include each adult individual. 
Implementation of the geroscience-based approaches into healthcare policy and 
practice would increase the ratio of healthy to unhealthy population due to 
delaying the onset of age-associated chronic pathologies. That might result in 
decreasing the biological age and increasing the age of disability, thus 
increasing the age of retirement and enhancing income without raising taxes. 
Economic, social and ethical aspects of applying the healthspan- and 
lifespan-promoting interventions, however, have to be comprehensively debated 
prior to their implementation in public health practice.

BACKGROUND: Loss of arm function is a common and distressing consequence of 
stroke. We describe the protocol for a pragmatic, multicentre randomised 
controlled trial to determine whether robot-assisted training improves upper 
limb function following stroke.
METHODS/DESIGN: Study design: a pragmatic, three-arm, multicentre randomised 
controlled trial, economic analysis and process evaluation.
SETTING: NHS stroke services.
PARTICIPANTS: adults with acute or chronic first-ever stroke (1 week to 5 years 
post stroke) causing moderate to severe upper limb functional limitation. 
Randomisation groups: 1. Robot-assisted training using the InMotion robotic gym 
system for 45 min, three times/week for 12 weeks 2. Enhanced upper limb therapy 
for 45 min, three times/week for 12 weeks 3. Usual NHS care in accordance with 
local clinical practice Randomisation: individual participant randomisation 
stratified by centre, time since stroke, and severity of upper limb impairment.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: upper limb function measured by the Action Research Arm Test 
(ARAT) at 3 months post randomisation.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: upper limb impairment (Fugl-Meyer Test), activities of daily 
living (Barthel ADL Index), quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale, EQ-5D-5L), 
resource use, cost per quality-adjusted life year and adverse events, at 3 and 
6 months. Blinding: outcomes are undertaken by blinded assessors. Economic 
analysis: micro-costing and economic evaluation of interventions compared to 
usual NHS care. A within-trial analysis, with an economic model will be used to 
extrapolate longer-term costs and outcomes. Process evaluation: semi-structured 
interviews with participants and professionals to seek their views and 
experiences of the rehabilitation that they have received or provided, and 
factors affecting the implementation of the trial.
SAMPLE SIZE: allowing for 10% attrition, 720 participants provide 80% power to 
detect a 15% difference in successful outcome between each of the treatment 
pairs. Successful outcome definition: baseline ARAT 0-7 must improve by 3 or 
more points; baseline ARAT 8-13 improve by 4 or more points; baseline ARAT 14-19 
improve by 5 or more points; baseline ARAT 20-39 improve by 6 or more points.
DISCUSSION: The results from this trial will determine whether robot-assisted 
training improves upper limb function post stroke.

BACKGROUND: The ambitious development agenda of the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) requires substantial investments across several sectors, including 
for SDG 3 (healthy lives and wellbeing). No estimates of the additional 
resources needed to strengthen comprehensive health service delivery towards the 
attainment of SDG 3 and universal health coverage in low-income and 
middle-income countries have been published.
METHODS: We developed a framework for health systems strengthening, within which 
population-level and individual-level health service coverage is gradually 
scaled up over time. We developed projections for 67 low-income and 
middle-income countries from 2016 to 2030, representing 95% of the total 
population in low-income and middle-income countries. We considered four service 
delivery platforms, and modelled two scenarios with differing levels of 
ambition: a progress scenario, in which countries' advancement towards global 
targets is constrained by their health system's assumed absorptive capacity, and 
an ambitious scenario, in which most countries attain the global targets. We 
estimated the associated costs and health effects, including reduced prevalence 
of illness, lives saved, and increases in life expectancy. We projected 
available funding by country and year, taking into account economic growth and 
anticipated allocation towards the health sector, to allow for an analysis of 
affordability and financial sustainability.
FINDINGS: We estimate that an additional $274 billion spending on health is 
needed per year by 2030 to make progress towards the SDG 3 targets (progress 
scenario), whereas US$371 billion would be needed to reach health system targets 
in the ambitious scenario-the equivalent of an additional $41 (range 15-102) or 
$58 (22-167) per person, respectively, by the final years of scale-up. In the 
ambitious scenario, total health-care spending would increase to a 
population-weighted mean of $271 per person (range 74-984) across country 
contexts, and the share of gross domestic product spent on health would increase 
to a mean of 7·5% (2·1-20·5). Around 75% of costs are for health systems, with 
health workforce and infrastructure (including medical equipment) as the main 
cost drivers. Despite projected increases in health spending, a financing gap of 
$20-54 billion per year is projected. Should funds be made available and used as 
planned, the ambitious scenario would save 97 million lives and significantly 
increase life expectancy by 3·1-8·4 years, depending on the country profile.
INTERPRETATION: All countries will need to strengthen investments in health 
systems to expand service provision in order to reach SDG 3 health targets, but 
even the poorest can reach some level of universality. In view of anticipated 
resource constraints, each country will need to prioritise equitably, plan 
strategically, and cost realistically its own path towards SDG 3 and universal 
health coverage.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed information provision and information needs about illness 
course, treatments, palliative care and euthanasia in cancer patients.
METHODS: Cancer patients consulting a university hospital (N=620) filled out a 
questionnaire. Their cancer related data were collected through the treating 
oncologist. This study is performed in Belgium, where "palliative care for all" 
is a patient's right embedded in the law and euthanasia is possible under 
certain conditions.
RESULTS: Around 80% received information about their illness course and 
treatments. Ten percent received information about palliative care and 
euthanasia. Most information about palliative care and euthanasia was given when 
the patient had a life expectancy of less than six months. However, a quarter of 
those in earlier phases in their illness trajectory, particularly those who 
experienced high pain, fatigue or nausea requested more information on these 
topics.
CONCLUSION: Many patients want more information about palliative care and 
euthanasia than what is currently provided, also those in an earlier than 
terminal phase of their disease.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Healthcare professionals should be more responsive, 
already from diagnosis, to the information needs about palliative care and 
possible end-of-life decisions. This should be patient-tailored, as some 
patients want more and some patients want less information.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness estimates of a 
brief counselling of smoking cessation in dentistry by using two different 
health economic models.
DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Intervention effectiveness was estimated in a 
cluster randomised controlled trial. The number of quitters was estimated based 
on 7-day abstinence and on smoking reduction at follow-up. Health economic 
evaluation was performed using two models: (1) a population-based model 
employing potential impact fractions and (2) a Markov model estimating the 
cost-effectiveness of the intervention for the actual participants. The 
evaluation was performed from healthcare and societal perspectives, and health 
gains were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
SETTING: Dental clinics in Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: 205 Swedish smokers aged 20-75 years.
INTERVENTIONS: A brief, structured behavioural intervention was compared with 
'usual care'.
RESULTS: The cost per quitter was US$552 in the intervention and US$522 in the 
'usual care' condition. The net saving estimated with the population-based model 
was US$17.3 million for intervention and US$49.9 million for 'usual care', with 
health gains of 1428 QALYs and 2369 QALYs, respectively, for the whole Swedish 
population during 10 years. The intervention was thus dominated by 'usual care'. 
The reverse was true when using the Markov model, showing net societal savings 
of US$71 000 for the intervention and US$57000 for 'usual care', with gains of 
5.42 QALYs and 4.74 QALYs, respectively, for lifelong quitters.
CONCLUSION: The comparison of intervention and 'usual care' derived from 
small-scale studies may be highly sensitive to the choice of the model used to 
calculate cost-effectiveness.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The cluster randomised trial is registered in the ISRCTN 
register of controlled trials with identification number ISRCTN50627997.

Hyphae of higher fungi grow at their tips and are compartmentalized by porous 
septa that enable inter-compartmental cytoplasmic streaming. Woronin bodies 
discontinue cytoplasmic streaming by plugging the septal pores. Here, it was 
assessed whether apical compartments of Aspergillus niger sustain their own 
growth or whether their growth depends on subapical compartments. Hyphae of 
wildtype and the ΔhexA strain, lacking Woronin bodies, had a similar morphology 
and growth rate. A total of 58% and 17% of the hyphae continued growing, 
respectively, after dissecting the 2nd compartment. Extension rate of the apical 
compartments that continued growing was not affected, even when the carbon or 
nitrogen source was limiting. Thus, apical compartments are self-sustaining in 
growth. It was also shown that the first 8 subapical compartments of the 
wildtype, but not of the ΔhexA strain, function as a backup system for growth by 
forming new branches when their apical neighbouring compartment has been 
damaged. This backup system is pivotal in nature because of the life style of 
fungi to continuously explore their surrounding substrate that may prove 
hostile.

Surviving spinal cord injury in low income countries.

Øderud T(1).

(1)SINTEF Technology and Society, Oslo, Norway.

BACKGROUND: Mortality rates from injuries are higher for people from poorer 
economic backgrounds than those with higher incomes (according to the World 
Health Organization [WHO]), and health care professionals and organisations 
dealing with people with disabilities experience that individuals with spinal 
cord injury (SCI) in low income countries face serious challenges in their daily 
lives.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to explore life expectancy (life 
expectancy is the average remaining years of life of an individual) and the 
situation of persons living with SCI in low income settings.
METHOD: Literature studies and qualitative methods were used. Qualitative data 
was collected through semi-structured interviews with 23 informants from four 
study sites in Zimbabwe representing persons with SCI, their relatives and 
rehabilitation professionals.
RESULTS: There are few publications available about life expectancy and the 
daily life of persons with SCI in low income countries. Those few publications 
identified and the study findings confirm that individuals with SCI are 
experiencing a high occurrence of pressure sores and urinary tract infections 
leading to unnecessary suffering, often causing premature death. Pain and 
depression are frequently reported and stigma and negative attitudes are 
experienced in society. Lack of appropriate wheelchairs and services, limited 
knowledge about SCI amongst health care staff, limited access to health care and 
rehabilitation services, loss of employment and lack of financial resources 
worsen the daily challenges.
CONCLUSION: The study indicates that life expectancy for individuals with SCI in 
low income settings is shorter than for the average population and also with 
respect to individuals with SCI in high income countries. Poverty worsened the 
situation for individuals with SCI, creating barriers that increase the risk of 
contracting harmful pressure sores and infections leading to premature death. 
Further explorations on mortality and how individuals with SCI and their 
families in low income settings are coping in their daily life are required to 
provide comprehensive evidences.

Multiple malignancies are an increasing combination in the recent years in 
cancer patients, due to prolonged survival rate and to the advances in 
diagnostic techniques and therapeutic management. We present the case of a 
patient diagnosed with prostate cancer and metachronous in one year with basal 
cell carcinoma of the skin and small lung cell carcinoma with lymph nodes and 
pararectal metastasis. To our best knowledge, this is the only case presented in 
the medical literature with these three different types of primary malignancy. 
In conclusion, multiple malignancies in the same patients are a real challenge 
to the physician, because an early diagnosis and specific treatment modalities 
are essential for successful patient management and increasing life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The average life expectancy is increasing worldwide, surpassing 
80 years in some countries. Recently, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) using modern 
devices and techniques has led to improved clinical outcomes following acute
