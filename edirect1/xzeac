угрозы процесса демографического старения в работах отечественных и зарубежных 
ученых. Особенности этого процесса в регионах Российской Федерации заключаются в 
чрезвычайном разнообразии социально-экономических, климатических, географических 
и ментальных условий, в которых протекают демографические процессы. Это 
обусловило наличие разных типов и стадий демографического старения на территории 
регионов Российской Федерации, а также возможностей смягчения негативных 
последствий данного процесса.

BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is frequently found in cases of 
obesity and related metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
composition of the microbiota in diabetics is similar to that of obese people, 
thereby causing increased energy uptake efficiency in the large intestine of 
obese people, maintenance of a systemic inflammatory state, and increased 
insulin resistance. Bariatric surgery seems to entail an improvement in gut 
dysbiosis, leading to an increased diversity of the gut microbiota.
AIMS: This study aimed to present a literature review on obesity-associated gut 
dysbiosis and its status post-bariatric surgery.
METHODS: A systematic review of primary studies was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, 
BIREME, LILACS, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases using DeCS (Health 
Science Descriptors) with the terms "obesity," "intestinal dysbiosis," 
"bariatric surgery," and "microbiota."
RESULTS: We analyzed 28 articles that had clinical studies or literature reviews 
as their main characteristics, of which 82% (n=23) corresponded to retrospective 
studies. The sample size of the studies ranged from 9 to 257 participants and/or 
fecal samples. The epidemiological profile showed a higher prevalence of obesity 
in females, ranging from 24.4 to 35.1%, with a mean age of around 25-40 years. 
There was a variation regarding the type of bariatric surgery, migrating between 
the Roux-en-Y bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and vertical gastrectomy. Of 
the 28 studies, 6 of them evaluated the gut microbiota of obese patients 
undergoing bariatric surgery and their relationship with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus/glucose metabolism/insulin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal microbiota is an important influencer in the 
regulation of the digestive tract, and obese individuals with comorbidities 
(diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome) present 
important alterations, with an unbalance normal state, generating dysbiosis and 
the proliferation of bacterial species that favor the appearance of new 
diseases. Patients who undergo bariatric surgery present an improvement in the 
intestinal microbiota imbalance as well as reversibility of their comorbidities, 
increasing their life expectancy.

RACIONAL: A disbiose da microbiota intestinal é encontrada frequentemente em 
casos de obesidade e doenças metabólicas relacionadas, como a diabetes mellitus 
tipo 2. A composição da microbiota em diabéticos é semelhante à de obesos, 
causando um aumento da eficiência de captação de energia no intestino grosso de 
obesos, manutenção de um estado inflamatório sistêmico e maior resistência à 
insulina. A cirurgia bariátrica parece acarretar em uma melhora da disbiose 
intestinal, levando ao aumento de diversidade da microbiota intestinal.
OBJETIVOS: Este artigo apresenta uma revisão de literatura sobre a disbiose 
intestinal associada a obesidade e seu status pós cirurgia bariátrica.
MÉTODOS: Uma revisão sistemática de estudos primários foi realizada em bases de 
dados PubMed, SciELO, BIREME, LILACS, Embase, ScienceDirect e Scopus utilizando 
o Descritores em Ciência da Saúde (DeCS) com os termos: “obesidade”, “disbiose 
intestinal”, “cirurgia bariátrica” e “microbiota”.
RESULTADOS: Foram analisados 28 artigos que tinham como característica principal 
serem estudos clínicos ou revisões de literatura, dos quais 82%, n=23, 
correspondem a estudos retrospectivos. O tamanho das amostras dos estudos variou 
de 9 a 257 participantes e/ou amostras fecais. O perfil epidemiológico mostrou 
haver maior prevalência de obesidade no sexo feminino, variação de 24,4 a 35,1%, 
com idade média em torno dos 25 a 40 anos. Houve uma variação com relação ao 
tipo de cirurgia bariátrica, migrando entre a Bypass em Y-de-Roux, Banda 
gástrica ajustável e gastrectomia vertical. Dos 28 estudos, 6 deles avaliaram a 
microbiota intestinal de obesos submetidos à cirurgia bariátrica e sua relação 
com diabetes mellitus tipo 2/metabolismo da glicose/resistência insulínica.
CONCLUSÕES: A microbiota intestinal é um importante influenciador na regulação 
do aparelho digestivo, e que indivíduos obesos com comorbidades (diabetes 
mellitus, hipercolesterolemia e síndrome metabólica) apresentam alterações 
importantes, com desequilíbrio do seu estado normal, gerando disbiose e a 
proliferação de espécies bacterianas que favorecem o aparecimento de novas 
doenças. Pacientes submetidos a cirurgia bariátrica apresentam melhora do 
desequilíbrio da microbiota intestinal, bem como uma reversibilidade de suas 
comorbidades, elevando a expectativa de vida.

PURPOSE: Spinal fusion surgery is often performed with pelvic fixation to 
prevent distal junctional kyphosis. The inclusion of spinopelvic fixation has 
been reported to induce progression of hip joint arthropathy in a radiographic 
follow-up study. However, its biomechanical mechanism has not yet been 
elucidated. This study aimed to compare the changes in hip joint moment before 
and after spinal fusion surgery.
METHODS: This study was an observational study and included nine patients (eight 
women and one man) who were scheduled to undergo spinopelvic fusion surgery. We 
calculated the three-dimensional external joint moments of the hip during gait, 
standing, and climbing stairs before and 1 year after surgery.
RESULTS: During gait, the maximum extension moment was 0.51 ± 0.29 and 
0.63 ± 0.40 before and after spinopelvic fusion surgery (p = 0.011), and maximum 
abduction moment was 0.60 ± 0.33 and 0.83 ± 0.34 before and after surgery 
(p = 0.004), respectively. During standing, maximum extension moment was 
0.76 ± 0.32 and 1.04 ± 0.21 before and after spinopelvic fusion surgery 
(p = 0.0026), and maximum abduction moment was 0.12 ± 0.20 and 0.36 ± 0.22 
before and after surgery (p = 0.0005), respectively. During climbing stairs, 
maximum extension moment was - 0.31 ± 0.30 and - 0.48 ± 0.15 before and after 
spinopelvic fusion surgery (p = 0.040), and maximum abduction moment was 
0.023 ± 0.18 and - 0.02 ± 0.13 before and after surgery (p = 0.038), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that hip joint flexion-extension and 
abduction-adduction moments increased after spinopelvic fixation surgery in the 
postures of standing, walking, and climbing stairs. The mechanism was considered 
to be adjacent joint disease after spinopelvic fusion surgery including 
sacroiliac joint fixation.

Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a rare, benign, locally destructive vascular 
tumor. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, a consumptive coagulopathy, is a 
life-threatening complication associated with kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. 
We describe a case of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma complicated by 
Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in a neonate born with a large facial mass with deep 
extension toward the cranium and airway. The mass was not identified prenatally. 
The patient was a 37-week gestation age female neonate born via spontaneous 
vaginal delivery and noted to have a large left-sided facial mass that was not 
noted on the most recent prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks gestation age. At 
birth, the patient was in respiratory distress and required continuous positive 
airway pressure support. Imaging revealed a large highly vascularized soft 
tissue mass adjacent to the airway with intracranial extension and bony 
destruction. Fine needle aspiration confirmed kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. 
On day of life 6, the patient was noted to have thrombocytopenia, elevated 
d-dimer, anemia, and hypofibrinogenemia, consistent with Kasabach-Merritt 
phenomenon, which resolved at day of life 12. Given the location and extent of 
the mass, medical therapy with single agent oral sirolimus was chosen over 
surgery. At 13-month follow-up, the infant is well on sirolimus therapy, and the 
mass has decreased in size, both clinically and on imaging. This case highlights 
the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of kaposiform 
hemangioendothelioma with extensive craniofacial and bony involvement with 
Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon with single oral therapy of sirolimus. Fibrinogen 
concentrate may be considered in the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon refractory to 
cryoprecipitate.

AIM: Among gynecological cancers, cervical cancer is the most common cause of 
cancer-related death in developing countries. This study analyzes the incidence, 
mortality, and burden of cervical cancer using the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 2019 study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The GBD (2019) data on cervical cancer was extracted from 
the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) query tool. Age-standardized rate (ASR) 
incidence, deaths, lost years of life (YLLs), years of life with disabilities 
(YLDs), and adjusted years of life with disabilities (DALYs) of cervical cancer 
in women were extracted. Data were extracted globally for 204 countries and 
groups based on a socio-demographic index (SDI), World Health Organization (WHO) 
regions, continents, World Bank regions, and 22 GBD regions.
RESULTS: The higher standardized age incidence of cervical cancer is in lower 
SDI countries, Africa, the African region (According to the WHO), and 
Sub-Saharan Africa (According to GBD regions). The highest deaths of ASR is in 
countries with low SDI, low-income group, Africa, the African region (According 
to the World Health Organization), and Sub-Saharan Africa (According to GBD 
regions). According to SDI classification, the highest DALYs ASR is in low SDI 
countries, World Bank Low-income countries, African and then American 
continents, African region, Sub-Saharan Africa, and then Latin America & 
Caribbean-WB (Based on GBD regions).
CONCLUSION: In 2019, incidence, mortality, and DALYs of cervical cancer mostly 
affected countries with lower socioeconomic status. Given that cervical cancer 
is highly preventable, access to screening services and the presence of trained 
and knowledgeable health care staff can reduce illness, suffering, and death 
caused by this malignancy. It is recommended to use the national and 
international potentials to reduce the incidence of this malignancy.

Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) has been widely studied in flowering 
plants, but studies of the mechanisms underlying pollen tube growth arrest by 
self S-RNase in GSI species are limited. In the present study, two leucine-rich 
repeat extensin genes in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri), PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2, 
were identified based on transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR analyses. 
The expression levels of these two LRX genes were significantly higher in the 
pollen grains and pollen tubes of the self-compatible cultivar 'Jinzhui' 
(harboring a spontaneous bud mutation) than in those of the self-incompatible 
cultivar 'Yali'. Both PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 stimulated pollen tube growth and 
attenuated the inhibitory effects of self S-RNase on pollen tube growth by 
stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and enhancing cell wall integrity. These 
results indicate that abnormal expression of PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 is involved 
in the loss of self-incompatibility in 'Jinzhui'. The PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 
promoters were directly bound by the ABRE-binding factor PbABF.D.2. Knockdown of 
PbABF.D.2 decreased PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 expression and inhibited pollen tube 
growth. Notably, the expression of PbLRXA2.1, PbLRXA2.2, and PbABF.D.2 was 
repressed by self S-RNase, suggesting that self S-RNase can arrest pollen tube 
growth by restricting the PbABF.D.2-PbLRXA2.1/PbLRXA2.2 signal cascade. These 
results provide novel insight into pollen tube growth arrest by self S-RNase.

This article reports on the findings from a scoping review on eating disorders 
and disordered eating in competitive cycling. The review was informed by a 
scoping review methodological framework as well as the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for scoping reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) reporting guidelines. PubMed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science were 
used to identify relevant literature for review. Fourteen studies met the 
eligibility criteria and were included in the full review. A narrative synthesis 
was used to summarise the main findings and themes across the included 
literature. Findings from the review are presented under the following themes: 
cycling as an 'at-risk' discipline; power to weight ratio; energy requirements 
and risk of low energy availability; the social environment of cycling; 
nutrition support provision; relationship between eating disorders/disordered 
eating and exercise addiction; and recommendations made in identified 
literature. Overall, the literature suggests competitive cycling is a sport with 
a high prevalence of disordered eating and/or eating disorders and a sport with 
unique risk factors that contribute to this. Crucially, more research is needed 
in this area. The article concludes with the gaps in the literature highlighted, 
implications for future research, and applications to policy and practice 
suggested.

With life expectancy increasing for the general population, public health 
promotion activities should be a priority to aim at a reduction of the burden 
and costs of hospitalization, disability, and lifelong treatment. This study 
aimed to explore the influence of parameters pertaining to different aspects of 
well-being, including physical and mental health and cognitive functioning, on 
self-perceived health, a predictor of chronic disease prevalence and mortality. 
We used data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) 
project gathered between 2013 and 2017, obtaining a sample of 96,902 
participants (63.23 ± 6.77 years). We found a strong association between the 
self-perceived health rating and not only physical health aspects but also 
mental health and cognitive functioning. In particular, BMI, chronic diseases 
and medications, muscle strength, and mobility issues had a strong effect on 
self-perceived health, as also did the quality of life, depression, and verbal 
fluency, while other aspects, such as individual characteristics, limitations in 
daily activities, and pain, among others only had a small effect. These results 
show that public health and prevention interventions should prioritize the 
targeting of all aspects of well-being and not only of physical health, 
acknowledging self-perceived health rating as a simple tool that could help 
provide a complete overview of psycho-physical well-being and functional status.

The majority of Canadians agree they have the right to end-of-life care in their 
own homes. While a palliative approach to care in the home setting has been 
demonstrated to be beneficial for patients and the healthcare system, it has 
rarely been well-integrated through an eHealth approach. Thus, in 2018, we 
piloted the RELIEF app, a digital symptom self-reporting tool for patients with 
palliative care needs. This was followed by the initiation of an extension phase 
of RELIEF in the home care setting. In this commentary, we share the 
implementation perspectives and experiences of the researchers and healthcare 
workers involved in this home care phase. It was mainly expressed that there 
were challenges with nurses feeling involved, supporting the research program, 
and using the technology, while patients and family caregivers had challenges 
using the app and cooperating with staff. We describe our lessons learned from 
these experiences and future changes to be enacted. A detailed report of this 
trial will be made available in future publications.

for food packaging and food shelf-life extension, with novel more green 
processes and materials following the spirit of circular economy and the global 
trend for environmentally positive fingerprints. A novel adsorption process to 
produce thymol-halloysite nanohybrids is presented in this work. The high 
dispersion of this thymol-halloysite nanostructure in chitosan biopolymer is one 
of the goals of this study. The incorporation of this biodegradable matrix with 
poly-vinyl-alcohol produced a very promising food-packaging film. Mechanical, 
water-oxygen barrier, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties were measured. 
Transparency levels were also tested using a UV-vis instrument. Moreover, the 
developed films were tested in-vivo for the preservation and the extension of 
the shelf-life of kiwi fruits. In all cases, results indicated that the 
increased fraction of thymol from thyme oil significantly enhances the 
antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the prepared chitosan-poly-vinyl- 
alcohol gel. The use of the halloysite increases the mechanical and water-oxygen 
barrier properties and leads to a control release process of thymol which 
extends the preservation and the shelf-life of kiwi fruits. Finally, the results 
indicated that the halloysite improves the properties of the 
chitosan/poly-vinyl-alcohol films, and the thymol makes them further 
advantageous.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, more elderly patients are being 
considered for metabolic bariatric surgery. We aimed to assess the safety and 
long-term effectiveness of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) compared to 
sleeve gastrectomy (SG).
METHODS: Single-center retrospective comparative study of OAGB and SG 
(2012-2019) in patients aged ≥ 65 years.
RESULTS: In all, 124 patients underwent OAGB (n = 41) and SG (n = 83). Mean age 
was 67.6 ± 2.8 and 67.6 ± 2.6 years (p = 0.89), respectively. Baseline 
characteristics were comparable, except lower rates of hypertension (HTN) and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in OAGB than SG patients (43.9% vs. 74.6%; 
p < 0.001, and 39.0% vs. 89.1%; p < 0.001, respectively). Body mass index (BMI) 
of OAGB and SG patients decreased from 41.8 ± 7.8 and 43.3 ± 5.9 kg/m2 
(p = 0.25) to 28.6 ± 4.7 and 33.2 ± 5.3 (p < 0.001), at long-term follow-up, 
respectively. Excess weight loss (EWL) > 50% was achieved in 80.6% and 43.2% of 
OAGB and SG patients, with a mean EWL of 67.2% ± 22.3 and 45.8% ± 18.0 
(p < 0.001) and a mean total weight loss (TWL) of 30.7% ± 10.4 and 21.9% ± 8.1 
(p < 0.001), respectively. Resolution rates of obesity-associated medical 
problems were similar, except type 2 diabetes (T2D) and HTN, which were 86.6% 
and 73.3% in OAGB, compared with 29.7% and 36.3% in SG patients (p < 0.001 and 
p = 0.001), respectively. Major early complication rates were comparable (2.4% 
vs. 3.6%; p = 0.73, respectively). Revision for late complications was required 
in two OAGB patients.
CONCLUSIONS: OAGB in the elderly is safe and results in better long-term weight 
reduction and resolution of T2D and HTN than SG.

(1) Background: The high prevalence of persons with wounds and its consequences 
for a person's quality of life makes the issue a relevant focus of attention for 
healthcare professionals. Through prognostic factors for healing, the individual 
risk of complications can be predicted, is possible to predict imminent delays 
and guide decision-making, thus helping healthcare professionals. (2) Methods: A 
scoping review performed according to JBI methodology and guided by the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) checklist will aim to identify the studies that meet predefined 
eligibility criteria. Five databases and gray literature will be the sources 
used to research adults with pressure ulcers, venous leg ulcers, arterial 
ulcers, or diabetic foot ulcers and report the prognostic factors for delayed 
healing in any care setting. (3) Results: This review will consider all 
quantitative and mixed studies in the last five years. The selection of articles 
will be carried out by two reviewers independently, using EndNoteWeb and Rayyan. 
Prognostic factors will be presented by design study, sampling, setting, 
outcome, wound type, and statistical methods. (4) Conclusions: Mapping 
prognostic factors for delayed healing could also be a starting point for a 
systematic review and meta-analyses to quantify the value of each factor.

Bottom-up models of functionally relevant patterns of neural activity provide an 
explicit link between neuronal dynamics and computation. A prime example of 
functional activity patterns are propagating bursts of place-cell activities 
called hippocampal replay, which is critical for memory consolidation. The 
sudden and repeated occurrences of these burst states during ongoing neural 
activity suggest metastable neural circuit dynamics. As metastability has been 
attributed to noise and/or slow fatigue mechanisms, we propose a concise 
mesoscopic model which accounts for both. Crucially, our model is bottom-up: it 
is analytically derived from the dynamics of finite-size networks of 
Linear-Nonlinear Poisson neurons with short-term synaptic depression. As such, 
noise is explicitly linked to stochastic spiking and network size, and fatigue 
is explicitly linked to synaptic dynamics. To derive the mesoscopic model, we 
first consider a homogeneous spiking neural network and follow the temporal 
coarse-graining approach of Gillespie to obtain a "chemical Langevin equation", 
which can be naturally interpreted as a stochastic neural mass model. The 
Langevin equation is computationally inexpensive to simulate and enables a 
thorough study of metastable dynamics in classical setups (population spikes and 
Up-Down-states dynamics) by means of phase-plane analysis. An extension of the 
Langevin equation for small network sizes is also presented. The stochastic 
neural mass model constitutes the basic component of our mesoscopic model for 
replay. We show that the mesoscopic model faithfully captures the statistical 
structure of individual replayed trajectories in microscopic simulations and in 
previously reported experimental data. Moreover, compared to the deterministic 
Romani-Tsodyks model of place-cell dynamics, it exhibits a higher level of 
variability regarding order, direction and timing of replayed trajectories, 
which seems biologically more plausible and could be functionally desirable. 
This variability is the product of a new dynamical regime where metastability 
emerges from a complex interplay between finite-size fluctuations and local 
fatigue.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of movement representation techniques (MRT) 
combined with conventional physical therapy (CFT) in people undergoing knee and 
hip arthroplasty compared to conventional physical therapy alone in terms of 
results in physical and functionality variables, cognitive function, and quality 
of life.
METHODOLOGY: the review was carried out according to the criteria of the PRISMA 
statement, considering studies in the electronic databases PubMed/Medline, 
Pubmed Central/Medline, Web of Science, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect.
RESULTS: MRT plus CFT generated therapeutic effects in some aspects of the 
physical variables: 100% pain (7 of 7 studies); 100% strength (5 out of 5 
studies); range of motion 87.5% (7 out of 8 studies); 100% speed (1 of 1 study), 
functional variables: 100% gait (7 of 7 studies); functional capacity 87.5% (7 
out of 8 studies); cognitive variables: 100% motor visualization ability (2 out 
of 2 studies); cognitive performance 100% (2 of 2 studies); and quality of life 
66.6% (2 of 3 studies). When comparing its effects with conventional physical 
therapy, the variables that reported the greatest statistically significant 
changes were motor visualization ability, speed, pain, strength and gait. The 
most used MRT was motor imagery (MI), and the average time extension of 
therapies was 3.5 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: movement representation techniques combined with conventional 
physical therapy are an innocuous and low-cost therapeutic intervention with 
therapeutic effects in patients with knee arthroplasty (KA) and hip arthroplasty 
(HA), and this combination generates greater therapeutic effects in physical, 
functional, and cognitive variables than conventional physical therapy alone.

The crystal protein Cry5B, a pore-forming protein produced by the soil bacterium 
Bacillus thuringiensis, has been demonstrated to have excellent anthelmintic 
activity. While a previous structure of the three-domain core region of 
Cry5B(112-698) had been reported, this structure lacked a key N-terminal 
extension critical to function. Here we report the structure of Cry5B(27-698) 
containing this N-terminal extension. This new structure adopts a distinct 
quaternary structure compared to the previous Cry5B(112-698) structure, and also 
exhibits a change in the conformation of residues 112-140 involved in linking 
the N-terminal extension to the three-domain core by forming a random coil and 
an extended α-helix. A role for the N-terminal extension is suggested based on a 
computational model of the tetramer with the conformation of residues 112-140 in 
its alternate α-helix conformation. Finally, based on the Cry5B(27-698) 
structure, site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed on Tyr495, which 
revealed that having an aromatic group or bulky group at this residue 495 is 
important for Cry5B toxicity.

This analysis documents U.S. racial/ethnic and gender differences in life 
expectancies with different self-reported sleep durations among adults aged 50 
and older. We used self-reported sleep duration and linked mortality information 
from the 2004-2015 National Health Interview Survey (n = 145,015) to calculate 
Sullivan Method Lifetables for life expectancies with different self-reported 
sleep duration states: short (≤6 hours), optimal (seven to 8 hours), and long 
(≥9 hours) sleep duration per-day by race/ethnicity and gender. Non-Hispanic 
Black men (35.8%, 95% CI: 34.8%-36.8%) and women (36.5%, 95% CI: 35.7%-37.1%) 
exhibited the highest proportion of years lived with short sleep duration 
followed by Hispanic men (31.1%, 95% CI: 29.9%-32.3%) and women (34.1%, 95% CI: 
33.1%-35.1%) and Non-Hispanic White men (25.8%, 95% CI: 25.4%-26.2%) and women 
(27.4%, 95% CI: 27.0%-27.7%). These results highlight how race/ethnic inequality 
in sleep duration and life expectancy are intertwined among older adults in the 
U.S.

OBJECTIVES: This article quantifies the potential gains in health-adjusted life 
expectancy for people aged 30 to 70 years (HALE[30-70]) by examining the 
reductions in disability in addition to premature mortality from noncommunicable 
diseases (NCDs).
METHODS: We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 for 4 
major NCDs (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and 
diabetes mellitus) in 188 countries from 2010 to 2019. Estimates of the 
potential gains in HALE[30-70] were based on a counterfactual analysis involving 
3 alternative future scenarios: (1) achieve Sustainable Development Goals target 
3.4 but do not make any progress on disability reduction, (2) achieve 
Sustainable Development Goals target 3.4 and eliminate NCD-related disability, 
and (3) eliminate all NCD-related mortality and disability.
RESULTS: In all scenarios, the high-income group has the greatest potential 
gains in HALE[30-70], above the global average. For all specific causes, 
potential gains in HALE[30-70] decrease as income levels fall. Across these 3 
scenarios, the potential gains in HALE[30-70] globally of reducing premature 
mortality for 4 major NCDs are 3.13 years, 4.53 years, and 7.32 years, 
respectively. In scenario A, all income groups have the greatest potential gains 
in HALE[30-70] from diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases. In scenarios B 
and C, the high-income group has the greatest potential gains in HALE[30-70] 
from cancer intervention, and the other income groups have the greatest 
potential gains in HALE[30-70] from cardiovascular diseases intervention.
CONCLUSION: Reducing premature death and disability from 4 major NCDs at once 
and attaching equal importance to each lead to a sizable improvement in 
HALE[30-70].

PURPOSE: To compare the long-term oncologic outcomes of intermediate risk (IR) 
prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with low dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) 
or moderate hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy (HF-EBRT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients diagnosed with IR PCa and treated with LDR-BT or 
HF-EBRT between January 2005 and December 2013 were included. Brachytherapy 
treatment involved a transperineal implant of iodine-125 to a dose of 145 Gy to 
the PTV, while HF-EBRT was delivered using intensity modulated radiotherapy with 
60 Gy in 20 fractions. The Phoenix ''nadir +2'' threshold was used to define 
biochemical relapse (BR). The cumulative incidence function (CIF) of BR and 
metastases was reported for each group and compared using the Gray's test to 
account for the competing risk of death. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used 
to estimate overall survival (OS) and prostate cancer specific survival (PCSS). 
Univariate (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analysis of the CIF of BR and 
metastases were performed. A 2-tailed p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: Overall, 122 and 124 patients were treated with LDR-BT and HF-EBRT 
respectively. Median follow-up was 95 months [interquartile range (IQR): 79-118] 
in the LDR-BT group and 96 months (IQR: 63-123) in the HF-EBRT group. BR was 
observed in 5 patients treated with LDR-BT and 34 treated with HF-EBRT. At 60 
and 90 months, the CIF of BR was 0.9% and 3.5% in the LDR-BT group vs. 16.6% and 
23.7% in the HF-EBRT (p < 0.001). The CIF of metastases at 90 and 108 months, 
was 0% and 1.6% vs. 3.4% and 9.1% in the LDR-BT and HF-EBRT groups (p = 0.003), 
respectively. At the last follow-up, 3 patients treated with HF-EBRT died from 
their cancer [PCSS of 97.5% at 8 years and none died in the LDR-BT group 
(p = 0.09). On UVA and MVA risk group and treatment modality were independently 
associated with CIF of BR. On UVA HF-EBRT and ISUP grade group 3 were associated 
with metastases.
CONCLUSION: LDR-BT was associated with higher biochemical and metastases control 
in our cohort when compared to moderately HF-EBRT. In the absence of a 
randomized trial, LDR-BT when feasible should be offered to patients with a life 
expectancy of >8 years.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare autosomal recessive neuromuscular 
disorder related to motor neuron degeneration. SMA patients present generally 
severe muscular weakness and atrophy, which can reduce life expectancy and lead 
to severe functional disability. In recent years, the management of this 
condition has been revolutionized by the development of innovative therapies 
that target alternative splicing of pre-messenger SMN2 RNA by antisense 
oligonucleotides or small molecules and by the approval of the first 
vector-based SMN1 gene therapy. The high significance of the trials in children 
led to fast-tracking of these therapies to all SMA patients despite the absence 
of data in adults. Real-life data are progressively providing a better 
understanding of the expected benefits and tolerability. They also highlight the 
difficulties of evaluating these patients and the need to take into account the 
patients' reported expectations and outcome. A review of the main data in adult 
patients is presented. The mechanisms of action of these innovative therapies 
are discussed as well as the limits of evaluations of these therapies in adults 
with longstanding severe amyotrophy.
