which was then shared with the authors. A matched-pair approach allowed us to 
compare longitudinal hair Hg concentration between cases (individuals who died 
aged younger than 60 years) and controls (individuals who lived beyond 60 
years). Matching criteria included year of birth (allowing 2 years either side), 
sex, and a minimum of four hair Hg concentration measures, of which at least two 
were in the same year. Analyses included change-point detection, interrupted 
time series, mixed models, and Cox survival models.
FINDINGS: We analysed data collected between Jan 1, 1970, and Jan 31, 1997, for 
657 individuals (319 women and 338 men, born between 1884 and 1991) for whom we 
assembled a retrospective database of yearly measures of hair Hg concentration 
(n=3603). Hair Hg concentration decreased over time. A subgroup of 222 
individuals (107 women and 115 men) reached or could have reached 60 years old 
by August, 2019. There was an increased risk of dying at a younger age among 
those with at least one hair Hg measure of 15 μg/g or more (adjusted hazard 
ratio 1·55, 95% CI 1·11-2·16; p=0·0088). Among the deceased individuals (n=154), 
longevity decreased by 1 year with every 6·25 μg/g (4·35-14·29) increase in hair 
Hg concentration. Analyses of 36 matched pairs showed that hair Hg concentration 
of those who died aged younger than 60 years was 4·7 times higher (3·4-5·9) than 
controls.
INTERPRETATION: The consistent findings between our different analyses support 
an association between long-term Hg exposure from freshwater fish consumption 
and premature mortality in this First Nation community. There is a need to do 
risk-benefit analyses of freshwater fish consumption in environmentally 
contaminated regions.

Ankyrins (encoded by ANK1/2/3 corresponding to Ankyrin-R/B/G or AnkR/B/G), via 
binding to spectrins, connect plasma membranes with actin cytoskeleton to 
maintain mechanical strengths and to modulate excitabilities of diverse cells 
such as neurons, muscle cells, and erythrocytes. Cellular and genetic evidences 
suggest that each isoform of ankyrins pairs with a specific β-spectrin in 
discrete subcellular membrane microdomains for distinct functions, although the 
molecular mechanisms underlying such ankyrin/β-spectrin pairings are unknown. In 
this study, we discover that a conserved and short extension N-terminal to the 
ZU5N-ZU5C-UPA tandem (exZZU) is critical for each ankyrin to bind to β-spectrins 
with high affinities. Structures of AnkB/G exZZU in complex with spectrin 
repeats13-15 of β2/β4-spectrins solved here reveal that the extension sequence 
of exZZU forms an additional β-strand contributing to the structural stability 
and enhanced affinity of each ZU5N/spectrin repeat interaction. The complex 
structures further reveal that the UPA domain of exZZU directly participates in 
spectrin binding. Formation of the exZZU supramodule juxtaposes the ZU5N and UPA 
domains for simultaneous interacting with spectrin repeats 14 and 15. However, 
our biochemical and structural investigations indicate that the direct and 
strong interactions between ankyrins and β-spectrins do not appear to determine 
their pairing specificities. Therefore, there likely exists additional 
mechanism(s) for modulating functional pairings between ankyrins and β-spectrins 
in cells.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in the US is 78.6 years, and although people are 
living longer, they are also living with chronic diseases. As women age, they 
are more susceptible to chronic disease including mental health conditions and 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia. Therefore, practical and cost effective ways 
to prevent the onset of cognitive, mental and physical ailments and increase the 
quality of life among aging populations is timely and warranted. The purpose of 
this study in aging adult women was to explore if prayer is associated with 
electrical brain activity patterns consistent with meditation and therefore a 
likely pro-health behavior.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 33 healthy women (Mage = 80.1, SD = 8.3) were 
recruited from a Midwestern Catholic Sisters community. Participants completed 6 
consecutive, counterbalanced electroencephalogram (EEG) sessions: three resting 
sessions and three praying sessions equating to 18 min of recorded EEG data for 
each participant. Differences in alpha power and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) 
between praying and resting conditions and the influence of age on the 
association between inter-individual differences in alpha power were explored.
RESULTS: Results indicated significant higher alpha power detected in electrodes 
positioned in the occipital area for praying sessions compared to resting 
sessions. Additionally, we found significant positive correlations between FAA 
values and age of the participants for both conditions (rest: r = 0.436, 
p = 0.016; pray: r = 0.434, p = 0.017), indicating more approach-related brain 
activity in older participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken collectively, our results suggest that prayerful meditation 
increased alpha power and that positive and approach-related (left 
frontal-central) brain activity increased as Sisters aged. Future studies should 
explore the mediating role of age as it relates to meditation and cognitive 
outcomes.

Recently, there has been significant interest in understanding the 
cost-effectiveness of treatments in spine surgery as health care systems in the 
United States move toward value-based care and alternative payment models. 
Previous studies have shown comparable outcomes of cervical disc arthroplasty 
(CDA) and anterior cervical discectomy fusion; however, there is a lack of 
consensus on the cost-effectiveness of CDA to support full adoption. Evidence of 
the limitations of these cost-analysis studies also exists in the literature, 
including industry funding, potential selection bias, and varying methods of 
calculating value. The goal of this narrative review is to provide an overview 
of the cost-effectiveness of CDA compared with anterior cervical discectomy and 
fusion, and potential limitations with cost-analysis studies in spine surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of addition of fruquintinib to 
best supportive care (BSC) in third-line treatment for patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: To conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis, a Markov model was 
established to simulate the course of metastatic CRC. Three health 
states-progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death-were 
included. Clinical data were derived from the FRESCO trial and health utility 
values were extracted from previous literature. The primary outcome of the study 
was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in US dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from a Chinese societal perspective. One-way 
sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to 
test the robustness of the study.
RESULTS: Addition of fruquintinib to BSC gained 0.54 QALY at a cost of 
$15,404.57 while the BSC group gained 0.38 QALY at a cost of $9603.94. ICER of 
fruquintinib versus BSC was $36,253.94/QALY. In the 1-way sensitivity analyses, 
utility for PD in both groups, utility for PFS in both groups, and cost of 
fruquintinib significantly influenced the results of the analysis. At the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $28,988.40/QALY, probabilities of addition of 
fruquintinib to BSC or BSC alone as the cost-effective option were 0% and 100%, 
indicating addition of fruquintinib is not a dominant option compared with BSC.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of fruquintinib to BSC is not a cost-effective regimen in 
the third-line setting for patients with metastatic CRC from the Chinese 
societal perspective.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and net 
monetary benefit of durvalumab consolidation therapy compared with no 
consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III 
non-small cell lung cancer with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression ≥1% 
from the Italian National Health Service perspective.
METHODS: We developed a 12-month decision tree combined with a lifetime cohort 
Markov model in which patients were assigned to receive durvalumab consolidation 
therapy or active follow-up (Italian standard of care) after chemoradiotherapy 
to compare cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefit of the two strategies 
during a 40-year period. Clinical outcomes data were obtained from the 
respective clinical trials and extrapolated using survival analysis; cost data 
were derived from Italian official sources and relevant real-world studies. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, incremental cost-utility ratio, and 
incremental net monetary benefit were computed and compared against a 16,372 € 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) willingness-to-pay threshold. We performed 
deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to 
assess how uncertainty affected results; we also performed scenario analyses to 
compare results under different pricing settings.
FINDINGS: In the base-case scenario, during a 40-year period, the total costs 
for patients treated with durvalumab consolidation therapy and active follow-up 
were €59,860 and €49,840 respectively; life-years gained were 3.47 and 3.31, 
respectively; and QALYs gained were 2.73 and 2.50, respectively, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €62,131 per life-year, an incremental 
cost-utility ratio of €42,322 per QALY, and an incremental net monetary benefit 
of €-6,144. We found that durvalumab was cost-effective (incremental net 
monetary benefit = 0) when a discount of 13% and 30% on its official price was 
applied, considering all other drugs priced according to official or maximum 
selling prices, respectively. Results were most sensitive to the 
progression-free survival rate for durvalumab and active follow-up, health 
utility in progression-free state, and price of subsequent treatments.
IMPLICATIONS: Our analysis indicates that durvalumab consolidation is 
cost-effective when a discount is applied on its official price. These results 
suggest that durvalumab may deliver an incremental health benefit with a 
contained upfront cost during a 40-year period, from the Italian National Health 
Service perspective, providing added value in a potentially curative care 
setting.

Macromolecular X-ray crystallography: soon to be a road less travelled?

Beale JH(1).

The number of new X-ray crystallography-based submissions to the Protein Data 
Bank appears to be at the beginning of a decline, perhaps signalling an end to 
the era of the dominance of X-ray crystallography within structural biology. 
This letter, from the viewpoint of a young structural biologist, applies the 
Copernican method to the life expectancy of crystallography and asks whether the 
technique is still the mainstay of structural biology. A study of the rate of 
Protein Data Bank depositions allows a more nuanced analysis of the fortunes of 
macromolecular X-ray crystallography and shows that cryo-electron microscopy 
might now be outcompeting crystallography for new labour and talent, perhaps 
heralding a change in the landscape of the field.

As life expectancy increases worldwide, ageing and age-related diseases arise as 
a major issue for societies around the globe. Understanding the biological 
mechanisms underlying the ageing process is thus instrumental for the 
development of efficient interventions aimed to prevent and treat age-related 
conditions. Current knowledge in the biogerontology field points to epigenetics 
as a critical component of the ageing process, not only by serving as a 
bona-fide marker of biological age but also by controlling and conferring 
inheritability to cellular and organismal ageing. This is reflected by a myriad 
of evidences demonstrating the relationship between DNA methylation, histone 
modifications, chromatin remodeling and small non-coding RNAs and several 
age-related phenotypes. Given the reversibility of epigenetic alterations, 
epigenetic reprogramming may also be envisioned as a potential approach to treat 
age-related disorders. Here we review how different types of epigenetic 
mechanisms are involved in the ageing process. In addition, we highlight how 
interventions modulate epigenetics and thus promote health- and lifespan.

Smoking and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure have been recently linked to a 
higher risk of breast cancer in women. The aim of this work is to estimate the 
number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from breast cancer 
attributable to these two risk factors in the European Union (EU-28) in 2017. 
The comparative risk assessment method was used. Data on prevalence of smoking 
and SHS exposure were extracted from the Eurobarometer surveys, relative risks 
from a recent meta-analysis, and data on mortality and DALYs from breast cancer 
were estimated from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors 
Study. In 2017, 82 239 DALYs and 3354 deaths from breast cancer in the EU-28 
could have been avoided by removing exposure to these two risk factors (smoking 
and SHS exposure). The proportion of DALYs from breast cancer lost respectively 
from smoking and SHS exposure was 2.6% and 1.0%, although geographically 
distributed with significant heterogeneity. These results represent the first 
estimates of breast cancer burden in women attributable to smoking and SHS 
exposure for the EU-28. It is important to increase awareness among women, 
health professionals and wider society of the association between smoking, SHS 
exposure and breast cancer, a relationship that is not widely recognised or 
discussed.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019 Mar 26;3:CD009261.

BACKGROUND: Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) 
are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs). Existing 
evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by 
primary closure remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of NPWT for preventing SSI in wounds healing 
through primary closure, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of NPWT in wounds 
healing through primary closure.
SEARCH METHODS: In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised 
Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid 
MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and 
EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and references of 
included studies, systematic reviews and health technology reports. There were 
no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included trials if they allocated participants to 
treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or 
compared one type of NPWT with another type of NPWT.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed 
trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 
assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and quality assessment 
according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations 
methodology.
MAIN RESULTS: In this third update, we added 15 new randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) and three new economic studies, resulting in a total of 44 RCTs (7447 
included participants) and five economic studies. Studies evaluated NPWT in the 
context of a wide range of surgeries including orthopaedic, obstetric, vascular 
and general procedures. Economic studies assessed NPWT in orthopaedic, obstetric 
and general surgical settings. All studies compared NPWT with standard 
dressings. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key 
domain. Primary outcomes Four studies (2107 participants) reported mortality. 
There is low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision) showing no 
clear difference in the risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT 
(2.3%) compared with standard dressings (2.7%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.47; I2 = 0%). Thirty-nine studies reported 
SSI; 31 of these (6204 participants), were included in meta-analysis. There is 
moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) that NPWT 
probably results in fewer SSI (8.8% of participants) than treatment with 
standard dressings (13.0% of participants) after surgery; RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 
to 0.80 ; I2 = 23%). Eighteen studies reported dehiscence; 14 of these (3809 
participants) were included in meta-analysis. There is low-certainty evidence 
(downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision) showing no clear 
difference in the risk of dehiscence after surgery for NPWT (5.3% of 
participants) compared with standard dressings (6.2% of participants) (RR 0.88, 
95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; I2 = 0%). Secondary outcomes There is low-certainty 
evidence showing no clear difference between NPWT and standard treatment for the 
outcomes of reoperation and incidence of seroma. For reoperation, the RR was 
1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; I2 = 13%; 12 trials; 3523 participants); for seroma, 
the RR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; seven trials; 729 participants). 
The effect of NPWT on occurrence of haematoma or skin blisters is uncertain 
(very low-certainty evidence); for haematoma, the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.28 to 
1.59; I2 = 0%; nine trials; 1202 participants) and for blisters the RR was 2.64 
(95% CI 0.65 to 10.68; I2 = 69%; seven trials; 796 participants). The overall 
effect of NPWT on pain is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence from seven 
trials (2218 participants) which reported disparate measures of pain); but 
moderate-certainty evidence suggests there is probably little difference between 
the groups in pain after three or six months following surgery for lower limb 
fracture (one trial, 1549 participants). There is also moderate-certainty 
evidence for women undergoing caesarean sections (one trial, 876 participants) 
and people having surgery for lower limb fractures (one trial, 1549 
participants) that there is probably little difference in quality of life scores 
at 30 days or 3 or 6 months, respectively. Cost-effectiveness Five economic 
studies, based wholly or partially on trials included in our review, assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT 
in four indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb 
fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They 
calculated quality-adjusted life-years for treatment groups and produced 
estimates of the treatments' relative cost-effectiveness. The reporting quality 
was good but the grade of the evidence varied from moderate to very low. There 
is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was 
not cost-effective at any threshold of willingness-to-pay and that NPWT is 
probably cost-effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other 
studies found low or very low-certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be 
cost-effective for the indications assessed.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: People experiencing primary wound closure of their 
surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably 
experience fewer SSI than people treated with standard dressings 
(moderate-certainty evidence). There is no clear difference in number of deaths 
or wound dehiscence between people treated with NPWT and standard dressings 
(low-certainty evidence). There are also no clear differences in secondary 
outcomes where all evidence was low or very low-certainty. In caesarean section 
in obese women and surgery for lower limb fracture, there is probably little 
difference in quality of life scores (moderate-certainty evidence). Most 
evidence on pain is very low-certainty, but there is probably no difference in 
pain between NPWT and standard dressings after surgery for lower limb fracture 
(moderate-certainty evidence). Assessments of cost-effectiveness of NPWT 
produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of 
ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. 
Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and 
setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Sep 19;9:CD002309.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with 
cough, sputum production or dyspnoea, and a reduction in lung function, quality 
of life, and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, no other treatments 
that slow lung function decline are available. Roflumilast and cilomilast are 
oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE₄) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway 
inflammation and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This Cochrane Review was 
first published in 2011, and was updated in 2017 and 2020.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral PDE₄ inhibitors for 
management of stable COPD.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the 
Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 9 March 2020). We found 
other trials at web-based clinical trials registers.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs if they compared oral PDE₄ inhibitors with 
placebo in people with COPD. We allowed co-administration of standard COPD 
therapy.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Two independent 
review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk 
of bias. We resolved discrepancies by involving a third review author. We 
assessed our confidence in the evidence by using GRADE recommendations. Primary 
outcomes were change in lung function (minimally important difference (MID) = 
100 mL) and quality of life (scale 0 to 100; higher score indicates more 
limitations).
MAIN RESULTS: We found 42 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were included 
in the analyses for roflumilast (28 trials with 18,046 participants) or 
cilomilast (14 trials with 6457 participants) or tetomilast (1 trial with 84 
participants), with a duration between six weeks and one year or longer. These 
trials included people across international study centres with moderate to very 
severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
grades II to IV), with mean age of 64 years. We judged risks of selection bias, 
performance bias, and attrition bias as low overall amongst the 39 published and 
unpublished trials. Lung function Treatment with a PDE₄ inhibitor was associated 
with a small, clinically insignificant improvement in forced expiratory volume 
in one second (FEV₁) over a mean of 40 weeks compared with placebo (mean 
difference (MD) 49.33 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 44.17 to 54.49; 
participants = 20,815; studies = 29; moderate-certainty evidence). Forced vital 
capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were also improved over 40 weeks 
(FVC: MD 86.98 mL, 95% CI 74.65 to 99.31; participants = 22,108; studies = 17; 
high-certainty evidence; PEF: MD 6.54 L/min, 95% CI 3.95 to 9.13; participants = 
4245; studies = 6; low-certainty evidence). Quality of life Trials reported 
improvements in quality of life over a mean of 33 weeks (St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -1.06 units, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.43; participants = 7645 
; moderate-certainty evidence). Incidence of exacerbations Treatment with a PDE₄ 
inhibitor was associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation over a 
mean of 40 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.84; participants = 
20,382; studies = 27; high-certainty evidence), that is, for every 100 people 
treated with PDE₄ inhibitors, five more remained exacerbation-free during the 
study period compared with those given placebo (number needed to treat for an 
additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20, 95% CI 16 to 27). No change in 
COPD-related symptoms nor in exercise tolerance was found. Adverse events More 
participants in the treatment groups experienced an adverse effect compared with 
control participants over a mean of 39 weeks (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.38; 
participants = 21,310; studies = 30; low-certainty evidence). Participants 
experienced a range of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, 
vomiting, or dyspepsia. Diarrhoea was more commonly reported with PDE₄ inhibitor 
treatment (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.74 to 3.50; participants = 20,623; studies = 29; 
high-certainty evidence), that is, for every 100 people treated with PDE₄ 
inhibitors, seven more suffered from diarrhoea during the study period compared 
with those given placebo (number needed to treat for an additional harmful 
outcome (NNTH) 15, 95% CI 13 to 17). The likelihood of psychiatric adverse 
events was higher with roflumilast 500 µg than with placebo (OR 2.13, 95% CI 
1.79 to 2.54; participants = 11,168; studies = 15 (COPD pool data); 
moderate-certainty evidence). Roflumilast in particular was associated with 
weight loss during the trial period and with an increase in insomnia and 
depressive mood symptoms. Participants treated with PDE₄ inhibitors were more 
likely to withdraw from trial participation; on average, 14% in the treatment 
groups withdrew compared with 8% in the control groups. Mortality No effect on 
mortality was found (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24; participants = 19,786; 
studies = 27; moderate-certainty evidence), although mortality was a rare event 
during these trials.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For this current update, five new studies from the 2020 
search contributed to existing findings but made little impact on outcomes 
described in earlier versions of this review. PDE₄ inhibitors offered a small 
benefit over placebo in improving lung function and reducing the likelihood of 
exacerbations in people with COPD; however, they had little impact on quality of 
life or on symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss were 
common, and the likelihood of psychiatric symptoms was higher, with roflumilast 
500 µg. The findings of this review provide cautious support for the use of PDE₄ 
inhibitors in COPD. In accordance with GOLD 2020 guidelines, they may have a 
place as add-on therapy for a subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or 
exacerbations despite optimal COPD management (e.g. people whose condition is 
not controlled by fixed-dose long-acting beta₂-agonist (LABA) and inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) combinations). More longer-term trials are needed to 
determine whether or not PDE₄ inhibitors modify FEV₁ decline, hospitalisation, 
or mortality in COPD.

BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation can facilitate multidisciplinary management for 
people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP). It provides health care 
access to individuals who are physically and economically disadvantaged.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 
telerehabilitation compared with a clinic-based intervention for people with 
NCLBP in Nigeria.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial from a 
health care perspective was conducted. Patients with NCLBP were assigned to 
either telerehabilitation-based McKenzie therapy (TBMT) or clinic-based McKenzie 
therapy (CBMT). Interventions were carried out 3 times weekly for a period of 8 
weeks. Patients' level of disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability 
Index (ODI) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. To estimate the health-related 
quality of life of the patients, the ODI was mapped to the short-form six 
dimensions instrument to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Health 
care resource use and costs were assessed based on the McKenzie extension 
protocol in Nigeria in 2019. Descriptive and inferential data analyses were also 
performed to assess the clinical effectiveness of the interventions. 
Bootstrapping was conducted to generate the point estimate of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (TBMT, n=21 and CBMT, n=26), with a mean age of 
47 (SD 11.6) years for telerehabilitation and 50 (SD 10.7) years for the 
clinic-based intervention, participated in this study. The mean cost estimates 
of TBMT and CBMT interventions per person were 22,200 naira (US $61.7) and 
38,200 naira (US $106), respectively. QALY gained was 0.085 for TBMT and 0.084 
for CBMT. The TBMT arm was associated with an additional 0.001 QALY (95% CI 
0.001 to 0.002) per participant compared with the CBMT arm. Thus, the ICER 
showed that the TBMT arm was less costly and more effective than the CBMT arm.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study suggested that telerehabilitation for 
people with NCLBP was cost saving. Given the small number of participants in 
this study, further examination of effects and costs of the interventions is 
needed within a larger sample size. In addition, future studies are required to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in the long term from the 
patient and societal perspective.

Conjugation of serum albumin or one of its ligands (such as fatty acid) has been 
an effective strategy to prolong the serum half-lives of drugs via neonatal Fc 
receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling of albumin. So far, fatty acid (FA) has been 
effective in prolonging the serum half-lives for therapeutic peptides and small 
proteins, but not for large therapeutic proteins. Very recently, it was reported 
a large protein conjugated to FA competes with the binding of FcRn with serum 
albumin, leading to limited serum half-life extension, because primary FA 
binding sites in serum albumin partially overlap with FcRn binding sites. In 
order to prevent such competition, longer linkers between FA and the large 
proteins were required. Herein, we hypothesized that small proteins do not cause 
substantial competition for FcRn binding to albumin, resulting in the extended 
serum half-life. Using a small protein (28 kDa), we investigated whether the 
intramolecular distance in FA-protein conjugate affects the FcRn binding with 
albumin and serum half-life using linkers with varying lengths. Unlike with the 
FA-conjugated large protein, all FA-conjugated small proteins with different 
linkers exhibited comparable the FcRn binding to albumin and extended serum 
half-life.

Italy is one of the oldest countries in Europe and in the world and now it is 
also one of the first countries that are fighting against COVID-19. In our 
country, the increasing life expectancy (80.5 for males and 84.9 for females, 
with a total life expectancy of 82.9) has led to very positive consequences for 
health and the well-being of elderly people: a very high number of older adults 
lives and acts independently in their daily life, even if they have one or more 
than one chronic disease. In the time of COVID-19's outbreak in Italy, the focus 
of the media was on elderly people for two main reasons. First, many older 
people demonstrated a very high civic sense and they were helping society to 
fight against the pandemic. Second, also in Italy, like in China, the older 
adults are at higher risk in being infected with COVID-19 and if they get ill, 
they have a higher risk of death. The balance previously achieved between 
age-related disorders and a good quality of life and good health is now under 
high pressure. It is very important to protect elderly people from infection, 
but also it is important to respect them and to support them in this complex 
situation. There is a great risk of "ageism". In agreement with Lloyd-Sherlock 
and colleagues (2020), in this editorial we propose some hints of analysis, 
starting from the ongoing experience in Italy.

Growing evidence reports that chronic kidney diseases (CKD) might play a role in 
erectile dysfunction (ED), but limited knowledge is available. Therefore, we 
performed a systematic review up to 21/08/2019 to investigate the associations 
between CKD and ED. The main analysis reported the prevalence of ED as absolute 
estimates (in %) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and across CKD stages 
(when specified), hemodialysis and transplant, calculating the p for interaction 
across strata. Among 291 studies, we included 34 articles with 5986 men. We 
found an overall prevalence of 76% (95%CI: 72-79) with a high degree of 
heterogeneity (I2 = 84.2%; p < 0.0001). Analyzing the data by CKD stage, we 
found a significant higher prevalence of ED in CKD (78%; 95%CI: 75-81%; I2 = not 
possible) compared with hemodialysis stage (prevalence = 77%; 95%CI: 73-80%; 
I2 = 84.5) or to patients undergoing transplant (prevalence = 64%; 95%CI: 
54-74%; I2 = 54%) (p across strata = 0.036). Considering the high prevalence of 
ED in men with CKD, health care practitioners should focus on issues of sexual 
health in men with CKD. Given the advancements in dialysis and therapy and the 
associated advancements in survival and life expectancy, maintaining the 
patients' sexual function is important for their well-being and quality of life.

Redox homeostasis is an essential requirement of the biological systems for 
performing various normal cellular functions including cellular growth, 
differentiation, senescence, survival and aging in humans. The changes in the 
basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are detrimental to cells and often 
lead to several disease conditions including cardiovascular, neurological, 
diabetes and cancer. During the last two decades, substantial research has been 
done which clearly suggests that ROS are essential for the initiation, 
progression, angiogenesis as well as metastasis of cancer in several ways. 
During the last two decades, the potential of dysregulated ROS to enhance tumor 
formation through the activation of various oncogenic signaling pathways, DNA 
mutations, immune escape, tumor microenvironment, metastasis, angiogenesis and 
extension of telomere has been discovered. At present, surgery followed by 
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is the major therapeutic modality for treating 
patients with either early or advanced stages of cancer. However, the majority 
of patients relapse or did not respond to initial treatment. One of the reasons 
for recurrence/relapse is the altered levels of ROS in tumor cells as well as in 
cancer-initiating stem cells. One of the critical issues is targeting the 
intracellular/extracellular ROS for significant antitumor response and 
relapse-free survival. Indeed, a large number of FDA-approved anticancer drugs 
are efficient to eliminate cancer cells and drug resistance by increasing ROS 
production. Thus, the modulation of oxidative stress response might represent a 
potential approach to eradicate cancer in combination with FDA-approved 
chemotherapies, radiotherapies as well as immunotherapies.

BACKGROUND: There have been no prior investigations of the cost effectiveness of 
transfusion strategies for trauma resuscitation. The Pragmatic, Randomized, 
Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) study was a Phase III multisite, 
randomized trial in 680 subjects comparing the efficacy of 1:1:1 transfusion 
ratios of plasma and platelets to red blood cells with the 1:1:2 ratio. We 
hypothesized that 1:1:1 transfusion results in an acceptable incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, when estimated using patients' age-specific life 
expectancy and cost of care during the 30-day PROPPR trial period.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision codes were prospectively collected, and subjects were matched 1:2 to 
subjects in the Healthcare Utilization Program State Inpatient Data to estimate 
cost weights. We used a decision tree analysis, combined with standard costs and 
estimated years of expected survival to determine the cost effectiveness of the 
two treatments.
RESULTS: The 1:1:1 group had higher overall costs for the blood products but 
were more likely to achieve hemostasis and decreased hemorrhagic death by 
24 hours (p = 0.006). For every 100 patients treated in the 1:1:1 group, eight 
more achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group. At 30 days, the total hospital 
cost per 100 patients was $5.6 million in the 1:1:1 group compared with $5.0 
million in the 1:1:2 group. For each 100 patients, the 1:1:1 group had 218.5 
more years of life expectancy. This was at a cost of $2994 per year gained.
CONCLUSION: The 1:1:1 transfusion ratio in severely injured hemorrhaging trauma 
patients is a very cost-effective strategy for increasing hemostasis and
