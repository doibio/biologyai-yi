BACKGROUND: Depression is a substantial global health problem, affecting >300 
million people and resulting in 12.7% of all deaths. Depression causes various 
physical and cognitive problems, leading to a 5-year to 10-year decrease in life 
expectancy compared with the general population. Physical activity is known to 
be an effective, evidence-based treatment for depression. However, people 
generally have difficulties with participating in physical activity owing to 
limitations in time and accessibility.
OBJECTIVE: To address this issue, this study aimed to contribute to the 
development of alternative and innovative intervention methods for depression 
and stress management in adults. More specifically, we attempted to investigate 
the effectiveness of a mobile phone-based physical activity program on 
depression, perceived stress, psychological well-being, and quality of life 
among adults in South Korea.
METHODS: Participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the mobile phone 
intervention or waitlist group. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess 
variables before and after treatment. The treatment group used the program 
around 3 times per week at home for 4 weeks, with each session lasting about 30 
minutes. To evaluate the program's impact, a 2 (condition) × 2 (time) 
repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted, considering pretreatment and 
posttreatment measures along with group as independent variables. For a more 
detailed analysis, paired-samples 2-tailed t tests were used to compare 
pretreatment and posttreatment measurements within each group. 
Independent-samples 2-tailed t tests were conducted to assess intergroup 
differences in pretreatment measurements.
RESULTS: The study included a total of 68 adults aged between 18 and 65 years, 
who were recruited both through web-based and offline methods. Of these 68 
individuals, 41 (60%) were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 27 (40%) 
to the waitlist group. The attrition rate was 10.2% after 4 weeks. The findings 
indicated that there is a significant main effect of time (F1,60=15.63; P=.003; 
ηp2=0.21) in participants' depression scores, indicating that there were changes 
in depression level across time. No significant changes were observed in 
perceived stress (P=.25), psychological well-being (P=.35), or quality of life 
(P=.07). Furthermore, depression scores significantly decreased in the treatment 
group (from 7.08 to 4.64; P=.03; Cohen d=0.50) but not in the waitlist group 
(from 6.72 to 5.08; P=.20; Cohen d=0.36). Perceived stress score of the 
treatment group also significantly decreased (from 2.95 to 2.72; P=.04; Cohen 
d=0.46) but not in the waitlist group (from 2.82 to 2.74; P=.55; Cohen d=0.15).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided experimental evidence that mobile phone-based 
physical activity program affects depression significantly. By exploring the 
potential of mobile phone-based physical activity programs as a treatment 
option, this study sought to improve accessibility and encourage participation 
in physical activity, ultimately promoting better mental health outcomes for 
individuals with depression and stress.

BACKGROUND: Patients with either treatment-resistant or relapsing advanced 
central pelvic neoplastic disease present with a condition responsible for 
debilitating symptoms and consequently poor quality of life (QoL). For these 
patients, therapeutic strategies are very limited and total pelvic evisceration 
is the only option for relieving the symptoms and increasing survival. Of note, 
taking charge of these patients cannot be limited to increasing their lifespan 
but must also be aimed at improving the clinical, psychological, and spiritual 
conditions. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the improvement in 
survival and QoL, focusing on spiritual wellbeing (SWB), in patients with poor 
life expectancy who underwent total pelvic evisceration for advanced 
gynecological cancers at our center.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The QoL and SWB were assessed using the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaire (EORTC 
QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-SWB32, and SWB scale, which were repeatedly administered: 
30 days before surgery, 7 days after the procedure, 1 and 3 months after 
surgery, and then every 3 months until death or the last follow-up assessment. 
Operative outcomes (blood loss, operative time, hospitalization, and incidence 
of complications) were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The patients and their 
families were included in a dedicated psycho-oncological and spiritual support 
protocol, which was managed by specifically trained and specialized personnel 
who accompanied them during all phases of the study.
RESULTS: A total of 20 consecutive patients from 2017 to 2022 were included in 
this study. Of these patients, 7 underwent total pelvic evisceration by 
laparotomy and 13 underwent laparoscopy. The median survival was 24 months 
(range: 1-61 months). After a median follow-up of 24 months, 16 (80%) and 10 
patients (50%) were alive at 1 year and 2 years after surgery, respectively. The 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores significantly improved yet at 7 days and at 1, 3, 6, and 
12 months, as compared with the preoperative values. In particular, an early 
improvement in pain, overall QoL, and physical and emotional functions was 
observed. With respect to the SWB, the global SWB item score of the EORTC 
QLQ-SWB32 questionnaire significantly increased after 1 month and 3 months, as 
compared with preoperative values (p = 0.0153 and p = 0.0018, respectively), and 
remained stable thereafter. The mean SWB scale score was 53.3, with a sense of 
low overall SWB in 10 patients, a sense of moderate SWB in eight patients, and a 
sense of high SWB in two patients. The SWB scale score significantly increased 
after 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months, as compared with the preoperative value 
(p = 0202, p = 0.0171, and p = 0.0255, respectively), and remained stable 
thereafter.
CONCLUSION: Total pelvic evisceration is a valid approach for improving both 
survival and QoL in selected patients with advanced pelvic neoplasms and poor 
life expectancy. Our results particularly underline the importance of 
accompanying the patients and their families during the journey with dedicated 
psychological and spiritual support protocols.

Introduction: The amine oxidase copper-containing 1 (AOC1) gene encodes for the 
diamine oxidase (DAO) enzyme. DAO is an enzyme that catabolizes some molecules, 
including histamine, and is the degradative enzyme in the polyamine catabolic 
pathway that is active in intestinal mucosal cells. Variants of AOC1 are 
associated with reduced DAO activity, resulting in accumulation of high levels 
of histamine and causing a wide range of neurological, gastrointestinal, and 
epidermal disorders, which are present in people with fibromyalgia. This study 
aimed to evaluate the impact of four AOC1 gene variants, namely, rs10156191, 
rs1049742, rs1049793, and rs2052129, on fibromyalgia symptoms measured by the 
Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), such as sleep disorders, atopic 
dermatitis, migraine, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, allergies, and 
intolerances, in adult women with fibromyalgia. Methods: The sample consisted of 
100 unrelated women with fibromyalgia between 33 and 60 years of age 
(48.48 years ±7.35), whose were diagnosed by a rheumatologist based on symptoms 
such as pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
AOC1 were identified using oral mucosa samples collected following a standard 
hygiene protocol. DNA was extracted, and gene variants of interest were analyzed 
using multiplex single-nucleotide primer extension (SNPE). Clinical data were 
collected using the FIQ and a series of variables that quantified the intensity 
and frequency of the symptoms. Results: The minor allele frequencies of 
rs10156191, rs1049742, rs1049793, and rs2052129 were 31.5, 10, 32.5, and 27%, 
respectively. Each variant was found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but 
partial linkage disequilibrium between AOC1 SNPs is suspected. The results show 
that fibromyalgia symptoms measured using the FIQ tend to increase with the 
number of risk alleles and that the intensity of dry skin and low stool 
consistency may be associated with an increase in the number of these alleles. 
Conclusion: This study constitutes the first step in investigating associations 
between fibromyalgia symptoms and candidate variants of the AOC1 gene in DAO 
enzyme activity. Identification of reduced DAO activity may improve the quality 
of life and treatment of symptoms in fibromyalgia patients.

California is a landmark setting for studying produce recovery efforts and 
policy implications because of its global relevance in agricultural production, 
its complex network of food recovery organizations, and its environmental and 
public health regulations. Through a series of focus groups with organizations 
involved in produce recovery (gleaning organizations) and emergency food 
operations (food banks, food pantries), this study aimed to deepen our 
understanding of the current produce recovery system and determine the major 
challenges and opportunities related to the produce recovery system. Operational 
and systematic barriers to produce recovery were highlighted by both gleaning 
and emergency food operations. Operational barriers, such as the lack of 
appropriate infrastructure and limited logistical support were found to be a 
challenge across groups and were directly tied to inadequate funding for these 
organizations. Systematic barriers, such as regulations related to food safety 
or reducing food loss and waste, were also found to impact both gleaning and 
emergency food organizations, but differences were observed in how each type of 
regulation impacted each stakeholder group. To support the expansion of food 
recovery efforts, participants expressed need for better coordination within and 
across food recovery networks and more positive and transparent engagement from 
regulators to increase understanding of the specifics of their unique 
operational constraints. The focus group participants also provided critiques on 
how emergency food assistance and food recovery are inscribed within the current 
food system and for longer term goals of reducing food insecurity and food loss 
and waste a systematic change will be required.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease involving continued elevated 
blood glucose levels. It is a leading cause of mortality and reduced life 
expectancy. Glycated human serum albumin (GHSA) has been reported to be a 
potential diabetes biomarker. A nanomaterial-based aptasensor is one of the 
effective techniques to detect GHSA. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been 
widely used in aptasensors as an aptamer fluorescence quencher due to their high 
biocompatibility and sensitivity. GHSA-selective fluorescent aptamers are first 
quenched upon binding to GQDs. The presence of albumin targets results in the 
release of aptamers to albumin and consequently fluorescence recovery. To date, 
the molecular details on how GQDs interact with GHSA-selective aptamers and 
albumin remain limited, especially the interactions of an aptamer-bound GQD 
(GQDA) with an albumin. Thus, in this work, molecular dynamics simulations were 
used to reveal the binding mechanism of human serum albumin (HSA) and GHSA to 
GQDA. The results show the rapid and spontaneous assembly of albumin and GQDA. 
Multiple sites of albumins can accommodate both aptamers and GQDs. This suggests 
that the saturation of aptamers on GQDs is required for accurate albumin 
detection. Guanine and thymine are keys for albumin-aptamer clustering. GHSA 
gets denatured more than HSA. The presence of bound GQDA on GHSA widens the 
entrance of drug site I, resulting in the release of open-chain glucose. The 
insight obtained here will serve as a base for accurate GQD-based aptasensor 
design and development.

This article addresses what motivations volunteers have for volunteering for 
refugees and whether these motivations differ from or complement motivations to 
volunteer in general, such as included in the widely used measurement 
instrument, the Volunteer Function Inventory (VFI). We organized eight focus 
groups with volunteers for refugees (N = 44) and interviewed five involved 
coordinators, all working in one city in the Netherlands. Results show that 
humanitarian concerns and social justice were highly relevant for people's 
motivations, next to volunteering to obtain or improve knowledge and skills. We 
find support for the earlier suggested extension of the VFI with the social 
justice motivation. Next, the current study expands existing analysis on 
volunteer motivations by identifying four areas that require further attention: 
(1) volunteers for refugees seek a meaningful role in life; (2) are motivated by 
the pragmatism of this volunteer work; (3) have emotional reasons; and (4) are 
motivated by media exposure.

Individuals' monetary values of decreases in mortality risk depend on the 
magnitude and timing of the risk reduction. We elicited stated preferences among 
three time paths of risk reduction yielding the same increase in life expectancy 
(decreasing risk for the next decade, subtracting a constant from or multiplying 
risk by a constant in all future years) and willingness to pay (WTP) for risk 
reductions differing in timing and life-expectancy gain. Respondents exhibited 
heterogeneous preferences over the alternative time paths, with almost 90 
percent reporting transitive orderings. WTP is statistically significantly 
associated with life-expectancy gain (between about 7 and 28 days) and with 
respondents' stated preferences over the alternative time paths. Estimated value 
per statistical life year (VSLY) can differ by time path and averages about 
$500,000, roughly consistent with conventional estimates obtained by dividing 
estimated value per statistical life by discounted life expectancy.

The economics of the COVID-19 pandemic: economic evaluation of government 
mitigation and suppression policies, health system innovations, and models of 
care.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the scope of health economics 
literature, which will increasingly examine value beyond health care 
interventions such as government policy and broad health system innovations.
AIM: The study analyzes economic evaluations and methodologies evaluating 
government policies suppressing or mitigating transmission and reducing 
COVID-19, broad health system innovations, and models of care. This can 
facilitate future economic evaluations and assist government and public health 
policy decisions during pandemics.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used. Methodological quality was 
quantified using the scoring criteria in European Journal of Health Economics, 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 
Checklist and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) 
Cost Benefit Analysis Checklist. PUBMED, Medline, and Google Scholar were 
searched from 2020-2021.
RESULTS: Cost utility analysis (CUA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA) analyzing 
mortality, morbidity, quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, national income 
loss, and value of production effectively evaluate government policies 
suppressing or mitigating COVID-19 transmission, disease, and impacting national 
income loss. The WHO's pandemic economic framework facilitates economic 
evaluations of social and movement restrictions. Social return on investment 
(SROI) links benefits to health and broader social improvements. Multi-criteria 
decision analysis (MCDA) can facilitate vaccine prioritization, equitable health 
access, and technology evaluation. Social welfare function (SWF) can account for 
social inequalities and population-wide policy impact. It is a generalization of 
CBA, and operationally, it is equal to an equity-weighted CBA. It can provide 
governments with a guideline for achieving the optimal distribution of income, 
which is vital during pandemics. Economic evaluations of broad health system 
innovations and care models addressing COVID-19 effectively use cost 
effectiveness analysis (CEA) that utilize decision trees and Monte Carlo models, 
and CUAs that effectively utilize decision trees and Markov models, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: These methodologies are very instructive for governments, in 
addition to their current use of CBA and the value of a statistical life 
analytical tool. CUA and CBA effectively evaluate government policies 
suppressing or mitigating COVID-19 transmission, disease, and impacts on 
national income loss. CEA and CUA effectively evaluate broad health system 
innovations and care models addressing COVID-19. The WHO's framework, SROI, 
MCDA, and SWF can also facilitate government decision-making during pandemics.

OBJECTIVE: Digital devices have demonstrated benefits to patients with chronic 
and neurodegenerative diseases. But when patients use medical devices in their 
homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the 
technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use.
METHODS: We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a 
larger device study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. 
Transcriptions were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we 
evaluated effort, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy and social 
influence of each device.In the effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the 
hassle to use the device; (b) its usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to 
daily life; and (e) problems during usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of 
five themes: (a) expectations regarding a device; (b) quality of the 
instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; (d) possibilities of optimization; 
and (e) possibilities to use the device longer. Regarding performance 
expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) insecurities with the performance of 
a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation for using a device. In the social 
influence category, three themes emerged: (a) reactions of peers; (b) concerns 
with the visibility of a device; and (c) concerns regarding data privacy.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify key factors that determine the acceptability of medical 
devices for home use from the participants' perspective. These include low 
effort of use, minor disruptions to their daily lives and good support from the 
study team.

BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have focused on the age-group-wise health burden of 
COVID-19 while few studies have focused on the gender-wise analysis of the 
burden of COVID-19. The present study estimated the health burden and value of 
premature mortality from COVID-19 based on gender and age.
METHODS: This study was based on secondary data collected from several sources 
of the government of India. To quantify the health burden, the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) method was used. An abridged life table 
was used to estimate the fall in life expectancy due to COVID-19. The value of 
premature mortality was estimated by using the human capital approach.
RESULTS: Among COVID-19 cases, 65.08% were males and 34.92% were females. The 
overall health burden caused by COVID-19 was 19,24,107 DALY in 2020, 43,40,526 
DALY in 2021, and 8,08,124 DALY in 2022. The health burden per 1000 males was 
more than double that per 1000 females. This was due to higher rates of 
infection and case fatality rate among males compared to females. The age group 
60-64 years experienced the highest loss of healthy life years per 1000 people, 
while the age group 55-59 years had the highest overall loss. Due to additional 
deaths from COVID-19, life expectancy decreased by 0.24 years in 2020, 0.47 
years in 2021, and 0.07 years in 2022. The total value of premature death in the 
first three years of the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to 15,849.99 crores INR.
CONCLUSION: In India, males and the older population were more susceptible to 
the impact of COVID-19.

Background  Glioma is a primary, malignant, highly aggressive brain tumor, with 
patients having an average life expectancy of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of these patients can be used to extract 
and analyze quantifiable features with potential clinical significance. We 
hypothesize that there is a correlation between radiomic features extracted from 
MRI scans and survival. Along with clinical data, the radiomic features could be 
used in survival prediction of patients, providing beneficial information for 
clinicians to design personalized treatment plans. Methods  In our study, we 
have utilized 3D Slicer for tumor segmentation and feature extraction and 
performed survival prediction of patients with glioma using four different 
machine learning models. Results and Conclusion  Among the models compared, we 
have achieved a maximum prediction accuracy of 64.4% using the k-nearest 
neighbors model, which was trained and tested on a combination of clinical data 
and radiomic features extracted from MRI images provided in the BraTS 2020 
dataset.

The evolving Internet of Things (IoT) promisingly improves the quality of life 
and transforms many industries. However, the IoT application challenges the 
wireless networks since the resource-constrained IoT devices typically need to 
send data to the cloud or edge server. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce 
an intermediate device between IoT devices and the servers, for example, to 
reduce the cost of direct communication between them. In another case, the 
device may move and collect the data from IoT devices before transmitting it to 
the server. The intermediate device should be designed to have resilient 
Internet connections and sufficient bandwidth in such a context. This work 
implements and evaluates a Multipath TCP (MPTCP) IoT router, which uses multiple 
radios to connect a server to address the demanding design. The router leverages 
MPTCP, an extension of TCP for simultaneous transmission over several paths on 
top of Wi-Fi interfaces. MPTCP has also supported several working modes for 
throughput and (or) resilience enhancements. First, we implement the MPTCP 
kernels, which can run on the popular IoT devices Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4. 
Second, we extensively evaluate the performance of IoT routers in a static and 
mobility scenario. The static scenario's evaluation results show that the 
MPTCP-based router can achieve seamless handover and bandwidth aggregation. In 
the mobility scenario, the MPTCP router with one backup path performs better 
than the single-path TCP. Besides, the MPTCP routers are more energy-efficient 
than TCP on the same hardware.

Understanding biodiversity's contributions to human health is the first step 
toward fostering synergies between biodiversity conservation and health 
promotion - two major targets of UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The One 
Health approach acknowledges the health of people and biodiversity are 
interconnected and facing common threats. In this study, we aimed to unveil the 
geographical association between avian biodiversity and population health across 
the US. In this ecological study, we combined citizen science bird data from 
eBird, population health data from the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation, and county-level statistics of population characteristics, including 
socio-economics, healthcare service etc. Multivariate linear regression analyses 
were performed between bird biodiversity (measured by rarefied species richness 
of birds), key indicators of general public health (e.g., cause-specific 
mortality rate), and socio-economic health determinants of 2751 US counties. We 
found that a higher number of bird species was significantly associated with 
longer life expectancy after confounding adjustment (regression coefficient (95% 
CIs), 0·005 (0·003, 0·008)). Bird species richness calculated using the rarefied 
method consistently accounted for variance in age-specific mortality risks in 
both very young and old age groups (R2 from 2% to 4%). Rarefied species richness 
of birds was negatively correlated with the majority of cause-specific deaths 
(12 out of 21 mutually exclusive causes of death), indicating a general synergy 
effect between biodiversity and human health. The associations with the top 
causes of deaths were regarded as highly significant, with considerable effect 
sizes, for example, for cardiovascular diseases (regression coefficient (95% 
CIs), -0·242 (-0·311, -0·174)). Our findings show human health is inseparable 
from the health of the shared environment and the well-being of all species. 
Bird species richness offers a valuable means to understand large-scale 
relationships between human health and the health of the environment. To enable 
equitable sharing of biodiversity's benefits to human health, more efforts 
should be made to understand two-way socio-ecological mechanism underlying 
human-biodiversity interactions.

STUDY DESIGN: Survey of cases.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the opinion of experts in the diagnostic process of 
clinically relevant Spinal Post-traumatic Deformity (SPTD).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SPTD is a potential complication of spine trauma 
that can cause decreased function and quality of life impairment. The question 
of when SPTD becomes clinically relevant is yet to be resolved.
METHODS: The survey of 7 cases was sent to 31 experts. The case presentation was 
medical history, diagnostic assessment, evaluation of diagnostic assessment, 
diagnosis, and treatment options. Means, ranges, percentages of participants, 
and descriptive statistics were calculated.
RESULTS: Seventeen spinal surgeons reviewed the presented cases. The items' 
fracture type and complaints were rated by the participants as more important, 
but no agreement existed on the items of medical history. In patients with 
possible SPTD in the cervical spine (C) area, participants requested a 
conventional radiograph (CR) (76%-83%), a flexion/extension CR (61%-71%), a 
computed tomography (CT)-scan (76%-89%), and a magnetic resonance (MR)-scan 
(89%-94%). In thoracolumbar spine (ThL) cases, full spine CR (89%-100%), CT scan 
(72%-94%), and MR scan (65%-94%) were requested most often. There was a 
consensus on 5 out of 7 cases with clinically relevant SPTD (82%-100%). When 
consensus existed on the diagnosis of SPTD, there was a consensus on the case 
being compensated or decompensated and being symptomatic or asymptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS: There was strong agreement in 5 out of 7 cases on the presence of 
the diagnosis of clinically relevant SPTD. Among spine experts, there is a 
strong consensus to use CT scan and MR scan, a cervical CR for C-cases, and a 
full spine CR for ThL-cases. The lack of agreement on items of the medical 
history suggests that a Delphi study can help us reach a consensus on the 
essential items of clinically relevant SPTD.

Seasonal Malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is one of the large-scale life-saving 
malaria interventions initially recommended for the Sahel subregion, including 
Burkina Faso and recently extended to other parts of Africa. Initially, SMC was 
restricted to children 3 to 59 months old, but an extension to older children in 
some locations was recently recommended. Further characterization of SMC 
population profile beyond age criterion is necessary for understanding factors 
that could negatively impact the effectiveness of the intervention and to define 
complementary measures that could enhance its impact. Children were assessed 
through a cross-sectional survey during the first month of the 2020 SMC campaign 
(July-August 2020) as part of the SMC-NUT project in the health district of 
Nanoro. Parameters such as body temperature, weight, height, mid-upper arm 
circumference (MUAC) were assessed. In addition, blood sample was collected for 
malaria diagnosis by rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and microscopy, and for 
haemoglobin measurement. A total of 1059 children were enrolled. RDT positivity 
rate (RPR) was 22.2%, while microscopy positivity rate (MPR) was 10.4%, with 
parasitaemia levels ranging from 40 to 70480/μL. RPR and MPR increased as 
patient age increased. Wasting was observed in 7.25% of children under SMC 
coverage while the prevalence of stunting and underweight was 48.79% and 23.38%, 
respectively. As the age of the children increased, an improvement in their 
nutritional status was observed. Finally, undernourished children had higher 
parasite densities than children with adequate nutritional status. In the health 
district of Nanoro, children who received Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) 
were mostly undernourished during the period of SMC delivery, suggesting the 
need for combining the SMC with synergistic interventions against malnutrition 
to achieve best impact.

BACKGROUND: A vascularized fibula graft (VFG) is the vascular autograft most 
frequently used to restore large segmental long bone defects, particularly in 
the upper limb. Because the use of a vascularized fibula involves an operation 
in an uninvolved extremity with potential morbidity, it is important to document 
that this type of reconstruction is successful in restoring function to the 
humerus. However, the long-term results of VFG after intercalary resection of 
the humeral diaphysis for bone tumors are still unknown.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What was the complication rate of reconstruction? (2) 
What was the functional result after surgical treatment, as assessed by the 
Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score, the American Shoulder and Elbow 
Society (ASES) score, and Constant score? (3) What was the survivorship of these 
grafts free from revision and graft removal at 5, 10, and 15 years?
METHODS: Between 1987 and 2021, 127 patients were treated at our institution 
with en bloc resection for a primary malignant or an aggressive benign bone 
tumor of the humerus; we excluded patients treated with extra-articular 
resection or amputation. Of those, 14% (18 of 127) were treated with intercalary 
resection of the humeral diaphysis for primary bone tumors and reconstruction 
with VFG, with or without a bulk allograft, and were analyzed in this 
retrospective study. Generally, our indications for reconstruction with VFG are 
intercalary resection of the humerus for primary malignant or aggressive benign 
bone tumors in patients with long life expectancy and high functional demands, 
in whom adequate bone stock of the proximal and distal epiphysis can be 
preserved. In 13 patients, VFG was used alone, whereas in five patients, a 
massive allograft was used. Our policy was to use VFG combined with a massive 
allograft in patients undergoing juxta-articular joint-sparing resections in 
which proximal osteotomy was performed close to the anatomic neck of the humerus 
to obtain more stable fixation and better tendinous reattachment of the rotator 
cuff and deltoid. All 18 patients who were treated with a VFG were available for 
follow-up at a minimum of 2 years (median follow-up 176 months, range 26 to 275 
months), and although three have not been seen in the past 5 years and are not 
known to have died, they had 172, 163, and 236 months of follow-up, and were 
included. The median age at surgery was 25 years (range 2 to 63 years), the 
median humeral resection length was 15 cm (range 8 to 21 cm), and the median 
fibular length was 16 cm (range 12 to 23 cm). Complications and functional 
scores were ascertained by chart review that was performed by an individual not 
involved in patient care. Functional results were assessed with the MSTS score 
(range 0 to 30), the ASES score (range 0 to 100), and the Constant score (range 
0% to 100%). Survivorship was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier survivorship 
estimator, which was suitable because there were few deaths in this series.
RESULTS: Seven patients underwent a revision procedure (one radial nerve 
transient palsy because of screw impingement, four nonunions in three patients 
with one humeral head avascular necrosis, treatment for screw-related pain in 
one patient, and two VFG fractures), and one patient underwent VFG removal. 
Donor site complications were observed in four patients (one ankle valgus 
deformity and three claw toes-the first toe in two patients and the other toes 
in the third). At the final clinical control, at a median follow-up of 176 
months (range 26 to 275 months), the median MSTS score was 30 of 30 (range 28 to 
30), the median ASES score was 98.3 (range 93 to 100), and the median Constant 
score was 93.5% (range 79% to 100%). Revision-free survival was 71% (95% CI 53% 
to 96%) at 5 years and 57% (95% CI 37% to 88%) at 10 and 15 years; VFG 
removal-free survival was 94% (95% CI 83% to 100%) at 5, 10, and 15 years.
CONCLUSION: VFG appears to be an effective reconstructive option after humeral 
intercalary resection for primary bone tumors. These are complex procedures and 
should be performed by an experienced team of surgeons who recognize that 
complications may occur frequently in the first years after the procedure. The 
frequency of mechanical complications observed in the first 5 years 
postoperatively may be lessened by using long spanning-plate fixation, and if 
successful, this reconstruction provides a long-term, durable reconstruction
