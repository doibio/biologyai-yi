As life expectancy grows, the death of an adult child becomes a highly prevalent 
problem for older adults. The present study is based on nine interviews and 
explores the experience of parents (≥70 years) outliving an adult child. The 
bereaved parents described some silencing processes constraining their 
expression of grief. When an adult dies, the social support system nearly 
automatically directs its care towards the bereaved nuclear family. Parental 
grief at old age is therefore often not recognized and/or acknowledged. Health 
care providers should be sensitive to the silent grief of older parents both in 
geriatric and oncology care settings.

Hampshire.

The cost of cancer care has increased by five fold over the last three decades. 
As our healthcare system shifts from volume to value, greater scrutiny of 
interventions with clinical equipoise is required. Traditionally, QALYs and ICER 
have served as surrogate markers for value. However, this approach fails to 
incorporate all stakeholders' viewpoints. Prostate cancer, low risk DCIS, and 
thyroid cancer are used as a framework to discuss value and cost-effectiveness.

Male births exceed female births by 5-6% (for a sex ratio at birth of 1.05-1.06) 
while a women's life expectancy, on a global scale, is about 6 years longer. 
Thus within various age groups the male:female ratio changes over time. Until 
age 50 years men outnumber women; thereafter their numbers show a sharp decline. 
Consequently at age 80 years, there are many more women than men. An estimated 
25% of this male excess mortality is due to biological causes, the rest being 
explained by behavioural, cultural and environmental factors. For both women and 
men, the main health risks related to lifestyle are smoking, alcohol, unhealthy 
diet and physical inactivity. In the year 2010, overweight (BMI: 25-29 kg/m(2)) 
and obesity (BMI: >30 kg/m(2)) were responsible for over 3 million deaths, with 
similar relative risks in men and women for overweight and obesity. Smoking and 
alcohol are the major causes of the global gender gap in mortality. For women in 
some parts of the world however pregnancy is also hazardous. On a global scale, 
in 2013 about 300 000 deaths were related to pregnancy, with sub-Saharan Africa 
registering the highest maternal mortality: over 500 maternal deaths per 100 000 
births. Additional woman's health risks arise from gender discrimination, 
including sex-selective abortion, violence against women and early child 
marriage. Providers should be aware of the effect that these risks can have on 
both reproductive and general health.

The plethora of literature has supported the potential benefits of Resveratrol 
(RV) as a life-extending as well as an anticancer compound. However, these two 
functional discrepancies resulted at different concentration ranges. Likewise, 
the role of Resveratrol on adult neurogenesis still remains controversial and 
less understood despite its well documented health benefits. To gather insight 
into the biological effects of RV on neurogenesis, we evaluated the possible 
effects of the compound on the proliferation and survival of neural progenitor 
cells (NPCs) in culture, and in the hippocampus of aged rats. Resveratrol 
exerted biphasic effects on NPCs; low concentrations (10 μM) stimulated cell 
proliferation mediated by increased phosphorylation of extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 kinases, whereas high concentrations 
(>20 μM) exhibited inhibitory effects. Administration of Resveratrol (20 mg/kg 
body weight) to adult rats significantly increased the number of newly generated 
cells in the hippocampus, with upregulation of p-CREB and SIRT1 proteins 
implicated in neuronal survival and lifespan extension respectively. We have 
successfully demonstrated that Resveratrol exhibits dose dependent discrepancies 
and at a lower concentration can have a positive impact on the proliferation, 
survival of NPCs and aged rat hippocampal neurogenesis implicating its potential 
as a candidate for restorative therapies against age related disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global and national burden of emergency conditions, 
and compare them to emergency care usage rates.
METHODS: We coded all 291 Global Burden of Disease 2010 conditions into three 
categories to estimate emergency burden: conditions that, if not addressed 
within hours to days of onset, commonly lead to serious disability or death; 
conditions with common acute decompensations that lead to serious disability or 
death; and non-emergencies. Emergency care usage rates were obtained from a 
systematic literature review on emergency care facilities in low-income and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), supplemented by national health system reports.
FINDINGS: All 15 leading causes of death and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) globally were conditions with potential emergent manifestations. We 
identified 41 facility-based reports in 23 countries, 12 of which were in LMICs; 
data for 17 additional countries were obtained from national or regional reports 
on emergency usage. Burden of emergency conditions was the highest in low-income 
countries, with median DALYs of 47 728 per 100 000 population (IQR 
45 253-50 085) in low-income, 25 186 (IQR 21 982-40 480) in middle-income and 
15 691 (IQR 14 649-16 382) in high-income countries. Patterns were similar using 
deaths to measure burden and excluding acute decompensations from the definition 
of emergency conditions. Conversely, emergency usage rates were the lowest in 
low-income countries, with median 8 visits per 1000 population (IQR 6-10), 78 
(IQR 25-197) in middle-income and 264 (IQR 177-341) in high-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher burden of emergency conditions, emergency usage 
rates are substantially lower in LMICs, likely due to limited access to 
emergency care.

OBJECTIVES: This is the second of the two papers introducing a cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) policy model. The first paper described the structure and 
statistical underpinning of the state-transition model, demonstrating how life 
expectancy estimates are generated for individuals defined by ASSIGN risk 
factors. This second paper describes how the model is prepared to undertake 
economic evaluation.
DESIGN: To generate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), the Scottish Health 
Survey was used to estimate background morbidity (health utilities) and the 
impact of CVD events (utility decrements). The SF-6D algorithm generated 
utilities and decrements were modelled using ordinary least squares (OLS). To 
generate lifetime hospital costs, the Scottish Heart Health Extended Cohort 
(SHHEC) was linked to the Scottish morbidity and death records (SMR) to cost 
each continuous inpatient stay (CIS). OLS and restricted cubic splines estimated 
annual costs before and after each of the first four events. A Kaplan-Meier 
sample average (KMSA) estimator was then used to weight expected health-related 
quality of life and costs by the probability of survival.
RESULTS: The policy model predicts the change in QALE and lifetime hospital 
costs as a result of an intervention(s) modifying risk factors. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis and a full uncertainty analysis can be undertaken, 
including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Notably, the impacts according to 
socioeconomic deprivation status can be made.
CONCLUSIONS: The policy model can conduct cost-effectiveness analysis and 
decision analysis to inform approaches to primary prevention, including 
individually targeted and population interventions, and to assess impacts on 
health inequalities.

In addition to psychosocial impairment, patients with severe mental illness 
(SMI) are exposed to substantial risks with respect to physical health. Their 
life expectancy is significantly shortened in the range of 1-2 decades. Against 
this background common medical comorbidities of this important group of patients 
are discussed (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disorders) with a 
focus on those clinical aspects most relevant for everyday psychiatric practice. 
Potentials for improvement of curative and preventive health care are outlined. 
Current scientific and clinical knowledge on somatic health of patients with SMI 
provides evidence of close interactions between physical and mental health. 
Meeting the challenge of compromised physical health in this particular group of 
patients might be a relevant topic for further conceptual development of 
psychiatry, psychotherapy und psychosomatic medicine.

OBJECTIVE: Levodopa is the gold standard in the pharmacological treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and its oral administration is associated with the 
development of disabling motor and non-motor complications in advanced disease. 
Levodopa is rapidly metabolized and has a short plasma half-life thus requiring 
frequent, repeated dosing. Impaired gastric emptying is common in PD, and likely 
contributes to the unpredictable motor responses observed with orally-dosed 
levodopa. A new therapeutic protocol for patients with advanced PD include a 
carbidopa/levodopa combination using continuous, modulated enteral 
administration achieved inserting a Jejunal Extension Tube Placement through 
Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG-J). The aim of this work is to assess 
efficacy and safety of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) delivered 
continuously through an intrajejunal percutaneous tube (PEG-J).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 11 adults with advanced PD and preserved 
sensitivity to L-dopa. For pre-procedural endoscopic evaluation each patient 
underwent a diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) 7 days before PEG-J 
placement to evaluate the presence of gastric anatomical or wall anomalies and 
the presence of oesophageal or gastric varices. Treatment with LCIG, consisting 
of a water-based suspension containing micronized levodopa (20 mg/mL) and 
carbidopa (5 mg/mL) in methylcellulose (Duodopa®), was administered by 
continuous jejunal infusion for 12h/day using a portable pump (CADD-Legacy) by 
PEG-J. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline (T0) before LCIG 
initiation, and after 3 (T3) and 6 (T6) months of therapy. The efficacy and 
safety outcomes were assessed by using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating 
Scale (UPDRS) parts II, III and IV.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 71.18 ± 5.4 SD at LCIG initiation. Out of the 
11 patients, 2 (18%) dropped-out LCIG at T3. Patients showed statistically 
significant (p < 0.05) higher performances in activities of daily living and a 
statistically significant (p < 0.001) lower incidence and severity of motor 
fluctuations, as rating by UPDRS part IV, compared to their best oral therapy. 
During observational period, 5 patients experienced adverse events. Success rate 
for PEG-J placement was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows that continuous intrajejunal infusion of LCIG 
ensures a reduction in motor Fluctuations compared to oral administration of 
levodopa-carbidopa in advanced PD. Based on our results and on the evidence 
emerging in the literature, this therapeutic approach should be the gold 
standard for therapy in these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To report on the cost-effectiveness of the Exercise for Health trial, 
comparing an exercise intervention with usual care during and following 
treatment for women with breast cancer.
METHODS: Women with breast cancer were randomized to an 8-month exercise 
intervention (involving regular contact with an exercise physiologist over the 
phone, n = 67, or home delivered face to face, n = 67) or usual care (n = 60) 
group and were assessed pre-intervention (5 weeks post-surgery), 
mid-intervention (6 months post-surgery), and 10 weeks post-intervention 
(12 months post-surgery). The benefit measures were "number of improvers" in 
quality of life (FACT-B+4) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on 
provider, patient, and government costs were used to consider 2 cost scenarios: 
(1) a service provider model and (2) a private model.
RESULTS: There were 69 improvers in the intervention group compared with 21 in 
the usual care group (odds ratio 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.08, 4.01; 
P = .033). The incremental cost per improver was A$2282 to A$2644. 
Quality-adjusted life years gain for the intervention group versus the usual 
care group was 0.009, with incremental cost per QALY gain for models 1 and 2 
being A$105 231 and A$90 842, respectively. However, sensitivity analyses 
indicate that incremental cost per QALY gained was volatile to EuroQol-5D-3L 
weights.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a pragmatic exercise intervention yields more 
women with markedly improved quality of life after breast cancer than usual care 
and may be cost-effective. The results are less certain in terms of incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life years; however, this may be an inappropriate 
measure for reflecting exercise benefit for women with breast cancer.

With increasing life expectancy and number of total hip arthroplasties (THA), 
the need for revision surgery is increasing too. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the optimal fracture treatment for a clinically characteristic 
Vancouver B1 fracture. We hypothesized that locking plate fixation has 
biomechanical advantages over fixation with a simple cerclage system. 
Additionally, we hypothesized that removal of the primary short stem and 
revision with a long stem would show biomechanical benefit. The biomechanical 
testing was performed with a static and a dynamic loading protocol on twenty 4th 
Generation sawbones. These were divided into four different groups (n = 5 each). 
In group 1, the primary uncemented short stem remained and the fracture was 
stabilized with a locking plate. In group 2, the primary stem remained and the 
fracture was stabilized with a cerclage stabilization system containing two 
stabilizers and four cerclages. In group 3, the primary stem was replaced by an 
uncemented long revision stem and the fracture was fixed with a locking plate. 
In group 4, the short stem was replaced by a long revision stem and the fracture 
was fixed with the cerclage system. Static testing revealed that the revision of 
the short stem with the long stem caused a 2-fold (p < 0.001, ANOVA) increase of 
axial stiffness. In dynamic testing, the number of cycles to failure was 4 times 
(p < 0.001, ANOVA) higher with the long revision stem. Compared to locked 
plating cerclage wiring demonstrated a 26% more cycles to failure (p = 0.031, 
ANOVA). The load to failure was 91% larger (p < 0.001, ANOVA) with the long 
revision stem and 11% smaller with locked plating (p < 0.001, ANOVA). In 
conclusion, the present biomechanical study indicates that periprosthetic 
Vancouver B1 fractures can be sufficiently fixed by simple cerclage systems. 
Revision with a long replacement stem provides a superior mechanical stability 
regardless of type of osteosynthesis fixation and is therefore a viable method 
in Vancouver B1 cases. A disadvantage of the cerclage system compared to plating 
is that an increased subsidence of the short stem was observed.

It is not clear whether between-country health inequity in Sub-Saharan Africa 
has been reduced over time due to economic development and increased foreign 
investments. We used the World Health Organization's data about 46 nations in 
Sub-Saharan Africa to test if under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and life expectancy 
(LE) converged or diverged from 1990 to 2011. We explored whether the standard 
deviation of selected health indicators decreased over time (i.e., sigma 
convergence), and whether the less developed countries moved toward the average 
level in the group (i.e., beta convergence). The variation of U5MR between 
countries became smaller from 1990 to 2001. Yet this sigma convergence trend did 
not continue after 2002. Life expectancy in Africa from 1990-2011 demonstrated a 
consistent convergence trend, even after controlling for initial differences of 
country-level factors. The lack of consistent convergence in U5MR partially 
resulted from the fact that countries with higher U5MR in 1990 eventually 
performed better than those countries with lower U5MRs in 1990, constituting a 
reversal in between-country health inequity. Thus, international aid agencies 
might consider to reassess the funding priority about which countries to invest 
in, especially in the field of early childhood health.

BACKGROUND: Though lead contaminated waste sites have been widely researched in 
many high-income countries, their prevalence and associated health outcomes have 
not been well documented in low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: Using the well-established health metric disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) and an exposure assessment method developed by Chatham-Stephens et al., 
we estimated the burden of disease resulting from exposure to lead at toxic 
waste sites in three Latin American countries in 2012: Argentina, Mexico and 
Uruguay. Toxic waste sites identified through Pure Earth's Toxic Sites 
Identification Program (TSIP) were screened for lead in both biological and 
environmental sample media. Estimates of cardiovascular disease incidence and 
other outcomes resulting from exposure to lead were utilized to estimate DALYs 
for each population at risk.
RESULTS: Approximately 316,703 persons in three countries were at risk of 
exposure to pollutants at 129 unique sites identified through the TSIP database. 
Exposure to lead was estimated to result in between 51,432 and 115,042 DALYs, 
depending on the weighting factor used. The estimated burden of disease caused 
by exposure to lead in this analysis is comparable to that estimated for 
Parkinson's disease and bladder cancer in these countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Lead continues to pose a significant public health risk in 
Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay. The burden of disease in these three countries 
is comparable with other widely recognized public health challenges. Knowledge 
of the relatively high number of DALYs associated with lead exposure may be used 
to generate support and funding for the remediation of toxic waste sites in 
these countries and others.

Lymphoma is the most common haematopoietic malignancy in dogs. Since a high 
proportion of dogs with lymphoma achieve remission soon after initiation of 
chemotherapy, an objective marker assessing treatment efficacy is required. 
Following clinical remission, the residual population of tumour cells can be 
referred to as the minimal residual disease (MRD). MRD traditionally has been 
detected by cytology and flow cytometry; however, if the burden of malignant 
cells is low, these methods might not be sufficiently sensitive to detect MRD. 
As an extension of the development of PCR for antigen receptor gene 
rearrangements (PARR) in dogs, there has been recent progress in the application 
of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to canine lymphoma. With the RT-qPCR 
system, a very high sensitivity (1 cell per 10,000 cells) has been achieved by 
preparing allele-specific oligonucleotide primers and probes designed from 
neoplastic clones of each dog. A series of MRD diagnostics studies employing the 
RT-qPCR system has revealed its usefulness as a prognostic indicator, an 
objective marker of treatment efficacy and a predictor of relapse for dogs with 
lymphoma receiving chemotherapy. Introduction of the MRD monitoring system will 
provide an innovative scientific tool in the development of superior treatments 
and monitoring strategies for canine lymphoma.

This paper proposes a new joint model for pairs of failure times in the presence 
of a cure fraction. The proposed model relaxes some of the assumptions required 
by the existing approaches. This allows us to add some flexibility to the 
dependence structure and to widen the range of association measures that can be 
defined. A numerically stable iterative algorithm based on estimating equations 
is proposed to estimate the parameters. The estimators are shown to be 
consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulations show that they have good 
finite-sample properties. The added flexibility of the proposal is illustrated 
with an application to data from a diabetes retinopathy study.

PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of wet age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) in Singapore in the year 2030. This projection will help in planning 
appropriate care provision and build health services capacity to cater to the 
increasing healthcare demand in 2030.
METHODS: The number of AMD patients aged 40-79 years from all Singaporeans was 
estimated using prevalence rates from a local study and using the United Nations 
population projections for Singapore to 2030. Age-specific mortality was 
accounted for. Additionally, two main scenarios were presented: (1) Projected 
number of wet AMD cases if patients were not taking preventive antioxidant 
vitamins; (2) projected number of wet AMD cases if patients were taking 
preventive antioxidant vitamins. Based on these scenarios, the economic burden 
was calculated. The number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as a 
result of improvement in visual acuity (VA) due to anti-vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) treatment was also calculated.
RESULTS: An estimated growth of 42% in the number of wet AMD cases is expected 
by 2030. The estimated economic burden of wet AMD in 2030 for scenarios 1 and 2 
is Singapore $203.1 million and $162.9 million, respectively. The QALYs gained 
as a result of improved VA from wet AMD treatment ranged from 10,114.4 to 
14,058.8 over a 5-year period for the 2030 cohort.
CONCLUSION: The burden of wet AMD is set to increase over the next 15 years. 
Appropriate measures to build healthcare capacity and plan for this expected 
surge in patients should be a priority in Singapore.

Nowadays, the increasing incidence of eating disorders due to poor self-control 
has given rise to increased obesity and other chronic weight problems, and 
ultimately, to reduced life expectancy. The capacity to refrain from automatic 
responses is usually high in situations in which making errors is highly likely. 
The protocol described here aims at reducing imprudent preference in women 
during hypothetical intertemporal choices about appetitive food by associating 
it with errors. First, participants undergo an error task where two different 
edible stimuli are associated with two different error likelihoods (high and 
low). Second, they make intertemporal choices about the two edible stimuli, 
separately. As a result, this method decreases the discount rate for future 
amounts of the edible reward that cued higher error likelihood, selectively. 
This effect is under the influence of the self-reported hunger level. The 
present protocol demonstrates that errors, well known as motivationally salient 
events, can induce the recruitment of cognitive control, thus being ultimately 
useful in reducing impatient choices for edible commodities.

Total joint replacement is a successful surgical intervention for the treatment 
of the degeneration of many joints, particularly the hip and knee. As the demand 
for joint replacement grows, and the life expectancy of the population 
increases, the performance requirements of these implants also changes. New 
materials, to improve longevity and enhance performance have been explored 
including PEEK and CFR-PEEK. This study investigated whether CFR-PEEK and PEEK 
were appropriate materials for total joint replacement by examining wear 
performance in simple configuration studies articulating against cobalt chrome 
under a range of cross-shear and contact pressure conditions. Simple geometry 
pin on plate studies were conducted for one million cycles for each test 
condition, with the contact pressure and cross-shear conditions representing a 
range in which the material may need to operate in-vivo. The wear factor for 
PEEK was significantly higher than CFR-PEEK and conventional polyethylene under 
all test conditions. Both PEEK and CFR-PEEK wear were influenced by contact 
pressure, with the highest wear factors for both materials measured at the 
highest pressure conditions. PEEK appeared to have a cross-shear dependent wear 
response, but this was not observed for the CFR-PEEK material. This study has 
further characterised the wear performance of two materials that are gaining 
interest for total joint replacement. The wear performance of the PEEK material 
showed poorer wear performance compared to polyethylene when articulating with a 
metal counterface, but the performance of the CFR-PEEK material suggested it may 
provide a suitable alternative to polyethylene in some applications. The wear 
performance of CFR-PEEK was poorer than polyethylene when it was used as the 
plate, when there was translation of the contact zone over the surface of the 
CFR-PEEK plate. This has implications for applications in low conforming 
contacts, such as lower conformity knee replacement.

Long-term survival after severe trauma is rarely addressed in German trauma 
journals although knowledge of life expectancy and identification of factors 
contributing to increased mortality are important for lifetime care management, 
development of service models, and targeting health promotion and prevention 
interventions. As reliable data in Germany are lacking, we compiled data mainly 
from the USA and Australia to describe life expectancy, risk factors, and 
predictors of outcome in patients experiencing traumatic spinal cord injury, 
traumatic brain injury, and polytrauma. Two years after trauma, life expectancy 
in all three categories was significantly lower than that of the general 
population. It depends strongly on severity of disability, age, and gender and 
is quantifiable. Whereas improvements in medical care have led to a marked 
decline in short-term mortality, surprisingly long-term survival in severe 
trauma has not changed over the past 30 years. Therefore, there is need to 
intensify long-term trauma patient care and to find new strategies to limit 
primary damage.

Purpose Investigate the relative effect of response outcome expectancies, work 
conditions, and number of subjective health complaints (SHC) on anxiety and 
depression in Norwegian employees. Learned response outcome expectancies are 
important contributors to health. Individual differences in the expectancy to 
cope with workplace and general life demands may be important for how work 
conditions influence health. Method A survey was conducted among 1746 municipal 
employees (mean age 44.1, SD = 11.5, 81.5 % female), as part of a randomized 
controlled trial. This cross-sectional study used baseline data. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis was performed. Outcome variables were anxiety and 
depression; response outcome expectancies, work conditions, and number of SHC 
were independent variables. Results A high number of SHC was a significant 
factor in explaining anxiety (OR 1.26), depression (OR 1.22) and comorbid 
anxiety and depression (OR 1.31). A high degree of no and/or negative response 
outcome expectancies was a significant factor in explaining depression (OR 1.19) 
and comorbid anxiety and depression (OR 1.28). The variance accounted for in the 
full models was 14 % for anxiety, 23 % for depression, and 41 % for comorbid 
anxiety and depression. Conclusion A high number of SHC, and a high degree of no 
and/or negative response outcome expectancies were associated with anxiety and 
depression. The strongest association was found for number of SHC. However, 
previous studies indicate that it may not be possible to prevent the occurrence 
of SHC. We suggest that workplace interventions targeting anxiety and depression 
could focus on influencing and altering employees' response outcome 
expectancies.

INTRODUCTION: New treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) are highly 
effective in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This 
study estimated the cost-effectiveness of treatments for genotype 1 (GT1) HCV in 
HIV-coinfected patients.
METHODS: A Markov model based on HCV natural history was used. The base-case 
analysis included both treatment-naïve and -experienced patients. Alternatives 
were ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir with or without ribavirin 
(3D ± R) for 12 or 24 weeks, sofosbuvir plus peginterferon and R (SOF + PR) for 
12 weeks, SOF + R for 24 weeks, and no treatment (NT). A subgroup analysis 
restricted to treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients compared 3D ± R for 
12 weeks to SOF plus ledipasvir (LDV) for 12 weeks and NT. Transition 
probabilities, utilities, and costs were obtained from the published literature. 
Outcomes were measured over a lifetime horizon and included rates of compensated 
cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related 
death, total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: In the base-case, SOF + R was dominated by both SOF + PR and 3D ± R. 
Compared to SOF + PR, 3D ± R had an ICER of $45,581. The lifetime rates of liver 
morbidity and mortality were lower among those treated with 3D ± R compared to 
SOF + PR, SOF + R, or NT. In the subgroup analysis, 3D ± R was cost-effective 
compared to NT at a threshold of $50,000 per QALY (ICER $27,496). SOF/LDV had an 
ICER of $104,489 per QALY gained compared to 3D ± R.
CONCLUSION: In the GT1 HCV population coinfected with HIV, 3D ± R was 
cost-effective compared to NT, SOF + R, and SOF + PR. In the treatment-naïve 
sub-population, 3D ± R was cost-effective compared to NT and SOF/LDV.

INTRODUCTION: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common side effect 
of opioid treatment. Treatment for OIC typically involves a laxative. However, 
some patients have an inadequate response to these (laxative inadequate 
responders, or LIR). This has led to the development of treatments such as 
naloxegol. This analysis estimates the impact of naloxegol on the health state 
utility of LIR patients, examines if this utility impact is driven by the change 
in OIC status, and estimates the utility impact of relief of OIC.
METHODS: The analysis was conducted using data from two 12-week randomized 
controlled trials, KODIAC 4 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01309841) and 
KODIAC 5 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01323790), plus KODIAC 7 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01395524), a 12-week extension to KODIAC 4. 
All were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral naloxegol (12.5 and 
25 mg) compared to placebo. Health state utility data were collected through the 
EuroQol-five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Descriptive analysis was 
undertaken to estimate how EQ-5D utility scores and EQ-5D domain responses 
varied with treatment, OIC status, and over time. A repeated measure 
mixed-effects model was used to predict the change from baseline in health state 
utility score over time.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, LIR patients treated with naloxegol 25 mg 
reported a 0.08 improvement in the EQ-5D overall score after 12 weeks of 
treatment. The analyses also suggest that change in OIC status is a key driver 
of the impact of OIC treatment on health state utility. When other factors are 
controlled, relieving OIC is associated with a 0.05 improvement in health state 
utility, although treatment with naloxegol is associated with an improvement in 
health state utility over and above the improvement in OIC status.
CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest that treatment with naloxegol improves 
patients' health state utility; driven predominantly by the relief of patients' 
constipation.

A multi-criteria framework combining safety, hygiene and sensorial quality was 
developed to investigate the possibility of extending the shelf-life and/or 
removing lactate by applying High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) in a ready-to-cook 
(RTC) poultry product. For this purpose, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes 
were considered as safety indicators and Escherichia coli as hygienic indicator. 
Predictive modeling was used to determine the influence of HHP and lactate 
concentration on microbial growth and survival of these indicators. To that end, 
probabilistic assessment exposure models developed in a previous study (Lerasle, 
M., Guillou, S., Simonin, H., Anthoine, V., Chéret, R., Federighi, M., Membré, 
J.M. 2014. Assessment of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes level in ready-to-cook 
poultry meat: Effect of various high pressure treatments and potassium lactate 
concentrations. International Journal of Food Microbiology 186, 74-83) were used 
for L. monocytogenes and Salmonella. Besides, for E. coli, an exposure 
assessment model was built by modeling data from challenge-test experiments. 
Finally, sensory tests and color measurements were performed to evaluate the 
effect of HHP on the organoleptic quality of an RTC product. Quantitative rules 
of decision based on safety, hygienic and organoleptic criteria were set. 
Hygienic and safety criteria were associated with probability to exceed maximum 
contamination levels of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli at the end of 
the shelf-life whereas organoleptic criteria corresponded to absence of 
statistical difference between pressurized and unpressurized products. A 
tradeoff between safety and hygienic risk, color and taste, was then applied to 
define process and formulation enabling shelf-life extension. In the resulting 
operating window, one condition was experimentally assayed on naturally 
contaminated RTC products to validate the multi-criteria approach. As a 
conclusion, the framework was validated; it was possible to extend the 
shelf-life of an RTC poultry product containing 1.8% (w/w) lactate by one week, 
despite slight color alteration. This approach could be profitably implemented 
by food processors as a decision support tool for shelf-life determination.
