proved to be a promising procedure in the treatment of hypothalamic obesity. We 
suggest performing it in children and adolescents with hypothalamic obesity to 
prevent or attenuate its devastating long-term sequelae.

BACKGROUND: Fissure sealant (FS) and fluoride varnish (FV) have been shown to be 
effective in preventing dental caries when tested against a no-treatment 
control. However, the relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
these interventions is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FS 
and FV in preventing dental caries in first permanent molars (FPMs) in 6- and 
7-year-olds and to determine their acceptability.
DESIGN: A randomised controlled allocation-blinded clinical trial with two 
parallel arms.
SETTING: A targeted population programme using mobile dental clinics (MDCs) in 
schools located in areas of high social and economic deprivation in South Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: In total, 1016 children were randomised, but one parent 
subsequently withdrew permission and so the analysis was based on 1015 children. 
The randomisation of participants was stratified by school and balanced for sex 
and primary dentition baseline caries levels using minimisation in a 1 : 1 ratio 
for treatments. A random component was added to the minimisation algorithm, such 
that it was not completely deterministic. Of the participants, 514 were 
randomised to receive FS and 502 were randomised to receive FV.
INTERVENTIONS: Resin-based FS was applied to caries-free FPMs and maintained at 
6-monthly intervals. FV was applied at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 
the course of 3 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of children developing caries into dentine 
(decayed, missing, filled teeth in permanent dentition, i.e. D4-6MFT) on any one 
of up to four treated FPMs after 36 months. The assessors were blinded to 
treatment allocation; however, the presence or absence of FS at assessment would 
obviously indicate the probable treatment received. Economic measures 
established the costs and budget impact of FS and FV and the relative 
cost-effectiveness of these technologies. Qualitative interviews determined the 
acceptability of the interventions.
RESULTS: At 36 months, 835 (82%) children remained in the trial: 417 in the FS 
arm and 418 in the FV arm. The proportion of children who developed caries into 
dentine on a least one FPM was lower in the FV arm (73; 17.5%) than in the FS 
arm (82, 19.6%) [odds ratio (OR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 
1.21; p = 0.35] but the difference was not statistically significant. The 
results were similar when the numbers of newly decayed teeth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 
0.60 to 1.22) and tooth surfaces (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.21) were examined. 
Trial fidelity was high: 95% of participants received five or six of the six 
scheduled treatments. Between 74% and 93% of sealants (upper and lower teeth) 
were intact at 36 months. The costs of the two technologies showed a small but 
statistically significant difference; the mean cost to the NHS (including 
intervention costs) per child was £500 for FS, compared with £432 for FV, a 
difference of £68.13 (95% CI £5.63 to £130.63; p = 0.033) in favour of FV. The 
budget impact analysis suggests that there is a cost saving of £68.13 (95% CI 
£5.63 to £130.63; p = 0.033) per child treated if using FV compared with the 
application of FS over this time period. An acceptability score completed by the 
children immediately after treatment and subsequent interviews demonstrated that 
both interventions were acceptable to the children. No adverse effects were 
reported.
LIMITATIONS: There are no important limitations to this study.
CONCLUSIONS: In a community oral health programme utilising MDCs and targeted at 
children with high caries risk, the twice-yearly application of FV resulted in 
caries prevention that is not significantly different from that obtained by 
applying and maintaining FSs after 36 months. FV proved less expensive.
FUTURE WORK: The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FS and FV 
following the cessation of active intervention merits investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of different strategies, including 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) and oral contraceptive therapy, 
for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence after conservative surgery.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a health care perspective.
SETTING: A health-resource-limited setting in China.
POPULATION: Patients who underwent conservative laparoscopic or laparotomic 
surgery for endometriosis.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed for the endometriosis disease course. 
Clinical data were obtained from published studies. Direct medical costs and 
resource utilization in the Chinese health care setting were taken into account. 
The health and economic outcomes were evaluated over a period from treatment 
initiation to menopause onset. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the 
impact of various parameters and assumptions on the model output.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs from 
a health care perspective.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 6-month GnRH-a therapy 
compared with no therapy ranged from $6,185 per QALY in deep endometriosis to 
$6,425 with peritoneal endometriosis. A one-way sensitivity analysis showed 
considerable influential factors, such as remission rates and utility values. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that 6-month GnRH-a therapy is 
cost-effective in most cases at a threshold of $7,400/QALY, regardless of the 
type of endometriosis.
CONCLUSION: Six months of therapy with GnRH-a can be a highly cost-effective 
option for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is cost effective for 
the prevention of endometriosis recurrence.

Life expectancy of patients with liver cirrhosis is closely linked to the degree 
of liver dysfunction and the occurrence of bacterial infection. An early 
diagnosis of infection helps to initiate adequate and timely measures and 
improves outcome of cirrhotic patients. Endocan is a newly recognized biomarker 
of sepsis. However, there have been no studies of the trends in endocan levels 
in cirrhotic patients with bacterial infection and their associations with 
markers of infection and inflammation. This study sought to assess the 
diagnostic value of serum levels of endocan, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive 
protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 126 
patients with cirrhosis: 51 with decompensated infected cirrhosis, 56 with 
decompensated uninfected and 19 with compensated uninfected cirrhosis at 
inclusion. We analyzed the association of endocan with clinical factors in 
cirrhosis by comparison with indicators of infection and inflammation. Endocan, 
PCT, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α were assayed in serum samples by ELISA analyses. Serum 
levels of endocan, PCT, CRP and TNF-α were significantly higher in cirrhotic 
patients with clinically overt infections. Endocan levels were correlated to 
neither PCT levels nor IL-6 levels in each group of patients with cirrhosis. CRP 
and TNF-α levels and Child-Pugh score correlated only in the infected group of 
patients with endocan levels, while in the uninfected groups of cirrhotic 
patients no significant correlation could be detected. The diagnostic accuracy 
of endocan increased in advanced stage of the disease. Serum endocan levels ≥ 
2.05 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 76.1% and specificity of 85% for the diagnosis 
bacterial infection in decompensated cirrhotic patients. The endocan measured at 
admission is a good clinical parameter predicting the occurrence of infection in 
these patients. Elevated endocan may reflect the degree of endothelial cell 
injury induced by a systemic inflammatory response, a pathologic process that 
could modify the course of advanced cirrhosis.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the cost-effectiveness of a supervised moderate-to-high 
intensity aerobic exercise programme in people diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) using 
participant-reported and proxy-reported measures of health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis of economic and HRQoL data 
from a randomised trial delivered over 16 weeks.
SETTING: Memory clinics in Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: 200 individuals with mild AD aged 50-90 years gave informed 
consent to participate in the study. Participants were randomised to control or 
intervention group.
INTERVENTIONS: Control group received treatment as usual. The intervention group 
performed 1 hour of supervised moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise three 
times weekly for 16 weeks.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: Different physical, functional and 
health measures were obtained at inclusion (baseline) and 4 and 16 weeks after. 
HRQoL (EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels/EQ-Visual Analogue Scale) was reported by 
the participants and the primary caregivers as proxy respondents. Differences in 
HRQOL as reported by the participant and caregiver were explored as were 
different values of caregiver time with respite from care tasks.
RESULTS: The intervention cost was estimated at €608 and €496 per participant, 
with and without transport cost, respectively. Participants and caregivers in 
the intervention group reported a small, positive non-significant improvement in 
EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS after 16 weeks. The ICER was estimated at €72 
000/quality-adjusted life year using participant-reported outcomes and €87000 
using caregiver-reported outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the exercise intervention is unlikely to 
be cost-effective within the commonly applied threshold values. The cost of the 
intervention might be offset by potential savings from reduction in use of 
health and social care.

Restarting iterative projection methods for Hermitian nonlinear eigenvalue 
problems with minmax property.

Germany.

In this work we present a new restart technique for iterative projection methods 
for nonlinear eigenvalue problems admitting minmax characterization of their 
eigenvalues. Our technique makes use of the minmax induced local enumeration of 
the eigenvalues in the inner iteration. In contrast to global numbering which 
requires including all the previously computed eigenvectors in the search 
subspace, the proposed local numbering only requires a presence of one 
eigenvector in the search subspace. This effectively eliminates the search 
subspace growth and therewith the super-linear increase of the computational 
costs if a large number of eigenvalues or eigenvalues in the interior of the 
spectrum are to be computed. The new restart technique is integrated into 
nonlinear iterative projection methods like the Nonlinear Arnoldi and 
Jacobi-Davidson methods. The efficiency of our new restart framework is 
demonstrated on a range of nonlinear eigenvalue problems: quadratic, rational 
and exponential including an industrial real-life conservative gyroscopic 
eigenvalue problem modeling free vibrations of a rolling tire. We also present 
an extension of the method to problems without minmax property but with 
eigenvalues which have a dominant either real or imaginary part and test it on 
two quadratic eigenvalue problems.

Current practice for gastric cancer treatment in Ukraine.

Sydiuk A(1).

Transplantation), National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, 
Ukraine.

Ukraine registers more than 8,000 new cases of gastric cancer (GC) annually. The 
disease is usually diagnosed at stage III-IV (65% of cases) and 62.2% of 
patients die within 1 year. About 70% of patients with GC need chemotherapy, and 
for most of them, this is the only way to increase their life expectancy. An 
unsolved problem of nationwide importance is achieving the early diagnosis of 
GC, which predetermines the treatment outcome. The 5-year survival rate for GC 
patients in Ukraine is only 13%, while early diagnosed GC is almost totally 
curable using surgery. Another important task is the development of national 
diagnosis and treatment standards, which will be based on national breakthroughs 
and will meet modern international requirements.

PURPOSE: Although hemorrhage within pituitary adenomas frequently exacerbates 
the symptoms, there are many grades of severity. Moreover, the contributing 
factors for symptom severity are still controversial.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 82 patients who underwent 
transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas with intratumoral hemorrhage. The 
grades of preoperative symptoms were classified into group A, asymptomatic or 
minor symptoms; group B, moderate symptoms sufficient for complain; and group C, 
severe symptoms disturbing daily life.
RESULTS: The hemorrhage volume within an adenoma was significantly higher in 
group C (92.6%) than in groups A (48.6%) and B (58.7%). Both headache and 
diplopia were dominant in group C, occurring in 72.2% and 27.8% of the patients, 
respectively. In group C, there was no significant difference in frequency 
between adenoma extensions into the sphenoid sinus (0%) and involvement of the 
cavernous sinus of Knosp grade 4 (0%), and extensions into the suprasellar 
region were not common (38.9%). The most distinctive feature was that "no 
extrasellar extension" was found only in group C (41.2%), and "multidirectional 
extension" was not detected in this group (0%). Multiple regression analysis 
revealed that the most powerful determining factors were the high frequencies of 
intratumoral hemorrhage and lack of extrasellar and multidirectional extensions.
CONCLUSION: Rapid volume expansion of a hematoma and lack of extension or 
unidirectional extension might lead to significant compression of the sellar and 
surrounding structures. Of note, the integrity of the sellar dura might 
contribute to the acute onset of symptom manifestations caused by hemorrhage in 
pituitary adenomas.

New treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis.

Panés J(1), Alfaro I(1).

(1)a Department of Gastroenterology , Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, 
CIBERehd , Barcelona , Spain.

Therapeutic strategies in ulcerative colitis are evolving. A personalized and 
optimal use of available drugs and the integration of new drug classes are the 
cornerstones underpinning the new treatment paradigms. Areas covered: A 
structured literature search in Medline and PubMed, Cochrane meta-analyses, and 
abstracts of international congresses has been performed to review therapeutic 
approaches to ulcerative colitis. The primary therapeutic objective of therapy 
is to achieve clinical remission since persistence of active disease, even if 
mild, leads to a significant reduction in quality of life. Current treatment 
paradigms of ulcerative colitis are based on the use of 5-aminosalycilates, 
corticosteroids, thiopurines, TNF-α inhibitors and α4ß7 integrin blockers. The 
main determinants for drug class selection are disease extension, disease 
severity, and previous drug history. New drug classes that will likely become 
available in the foreseeable future include inhibitors of Janus kinases, 
modulators of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, SMAD-7 antisense 
oligonucleotides, interleukin-12/23 blockers, and fecal microbiota 
transplantation. Expert commentary: Increasing therapeutic options for 
ulcerative colitis make predictors of response highly relevant. While these are 
not available, judicious use of therapies, avoidance of underdosing, or 
persistent therapy when criteria for drug failure are met are essential.

Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide required for cellular adhesion, 
extension, and plant growth. The pectic methylesterification status of guard 
cell walls influences the movement of stomata in response to different stimuli. 
Pectin methylesterase (PME) has a profound effect on cell wall modification, 
especially on the degree of pectic methylesterification during heat response. 
The Arabidopsis thaliana PME34 gene is highly expressed in guard cells and in 
response to the phytohormone abscisic acid. The genetic data highlighted the 
significant role of PME34 in heat tolerance through the regulation of stomatal 
movement. Thus, the opening and closure of stomata is mediated by changes in 
response to a given stimulus, could require a specific cell wall modifying 
enzyme to function properly.

Siegen, 57076, Germany. max.lemme@rwth-aachen.de.

We report on the integration of large area CVD grown single- and bilayer 
graphene transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) on amorphous silicon 
multispectral photodetectors. The broadband transmission of graphene results in 
440% enhancement of the detectors' spectral response in the ultraviolet (UV) 
region at λ = 320 nm compared to reference devices with conventional aluminum 
doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) electrodes. The maximum responsivity of the 
multispectral photodetectors can be tuned in their wavelength from 320 nm to 510 
nm by an external bias voltage, allowing single pixel detection of UV to visible 
light. Graphene electrodes further enable fully flexible diodes on polyimide 
substrates. Here, an upgrade from single to bilayer graphene boosts the maximum 
photoresponsivity from 134 mA W-1 to 239 mA W-1. Interference patterns that are 
present in conventional TCE devices are suppressed as a result of the atomically 
thin graphene electrodes. The proposed detectors may be of interest in fields of 
UV/VIS spectroscopy or for biomedical and life science applications, where the 
extension to the UV range can be essential.

Estimation of population-based cancer-specific potential years of life lost in 
Belgium.

Silversmit G(1), Vaes E, van Eycken L.

Author information:
(1)Belgian Cancer Registry, Rue Royale, Bruxelles, Belgium.

The potential years of life lost (PYLL) observed in a cohort of cancer patients 
cannot be fully assigned to the cancer as both cancer-related and 
non-cancer-related deaths contribute. A method is presented to decompose the 
observed all-cause PYLL into cancer mortality and population background 
mortality fractions when cause of death information is not available. 
Furthermore, the association of cancer-specific PYLL with cancer-specific 
mortality and mean age at diagnosis is explored and the impact of the follow-up 
window length is examined. The framework of the actuarial relative survival and 
the Ederer II method is applied to estimate the population background mortality 
contribution, PYLL*. The fraction (PYLL-PYLL*)/PYLL is then attributed to the 
cancer. The method is applied to cancer incidence in Belgium 2004-2014, about 
631 300 cancer patients. The cancer-specific PYLL divided by the number of 
cancer patients, mean PYLL, in the Belgian cancer population ranges from 0.4 
years for prostate cancer to 15 years for tumours of the central nervous system. 
The cancer-specific mean PYLL increases with both increasing cancer-specific 
mortality and decreasing age at diagnosis. Longer follow-up periods yield larger 
cancer-specific mean PYLL until statistical cure of cancer is achieved. The mean 
PYLL results, obtained by dividing the PYLL by the number of cancer patients, 
are visualized in combination with cancer incidence and mean age and mean life 
expectancy at diagnosis, providing an elegant summary to rank and compare cancer 
sites in terms of incidence, relative survival and PYLL.

EM(1).

(2)2 Department of Medical Oncology, Academic Medical Center, University of 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Particularly at the end of life, treatment decisions should be 
shared and incorporate patients' preferences. This study examines elaboration 
and preference construction.
AIM: To examine the values, appraisals and preferences that patients express, as 
well as the oncologists' communicative behaviour that facilitates these 
expressions in consultations on palliative chemotherapy.
DESIGN: Verbatim transcripts of audio-recorded consultations ( n = 60) were 
analysed in MAXqda10 software. Two independent coders identified and categorised 
patients' preference-related utterances and oncologists' utterances, preceding 
and following such expressions.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Cancer patients ( n = 41) with a median life expectancy 
<1 year and oncologists ( n = 13) meeting with them in either initial or 
evaluative follow-up consultations.
RESULTS: Most frequent were patients' expressions of treatment preferences (65% 
of consultations), often the simple wish to have treatment. Expressions of 
underlying values (48%) and appraisals of treatment aspects (50%) were less 
common. Most preference-related utterances concerned single statements (59%); in 
51% of the consultations, true dialogue was observed. Preference-related 
utterances were least common in follow-up consultations concerning stable 
disease or response. Preference-related fragments were patient-initiated (42%), 
oncologist-facilitated (28%) or oncologist-invited (30%). Oncologist responses 
likely to trigger more preference-related talk were showing empathy, checking 
and probe questioning. Likely to reduce space were providing information, 
personally agreeing and neutral responses.
CONCLUSION: Elaboration and joint preference construction is not standard 
practice in consultations on palliative chemotherapy. Oncologists may benefit 
from realising this and training skills that support this key step of shared 
decision making. Also, repeated shared decision making throughout the course of 
palliative chemotherapy should be stimulated.

BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by 
deficient activity of α -galactosidase A which leads to progressive 
intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in tissues and organs 
including heart, kidney, vascular endothelium, the nervous system, the eyes and 
the skin. Cardiac involvement is common, leads to fatal complications and is 
mainly responsible for reduced life expectancy in Fabry disease. The exact 
staging of disease progression and timely initiation of treatment is essential 
in Fabry disease. Therefore, it is essential to use the possibilities of 
specific biomarkers for early detection of organ involvement or early diagnosis.
METHODS: By the use of Pubmed all relevant papers for biomarkers in Fabry 
disease were screened. The quality of retrieved papers was appraised using 
standard tools. Finally, 70 peer reviewed paper were included.
RESULTS: In the past biomarkers for Fabry disease biomarkers did not have 
clinical relevance. Nowadays, a lot of research is focusing on identification of 
new biomarkers and their clinical relevance. Only two biomarkers reached 
clinical applicability. Lyso-GB3 for identification of atypical FD variants and 
hsTNT for identification of cardiac involvement, which should indicate further 
diagnostics. Treatment response to ERT can be monitored by lyso-GB3 but data for 
long-time outcome are missing. A lot of GB3-related analogs are identified in 
urine and plasma, some of which might play an important role for managing Fabry 
disease in future.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we suggest to measure lyso-GB3 and hsTNT at least 
once a year. The routine measurement of these two biomarkers will help now for 
the staging of every individual patient and in addition, will help for a better 
general understanding of Fabry disease.

people with suspected infectious gastroenteritis: a systematic review and 
economic analysis.

BACKGROUND: Gastroenteritis is a common, transient disorder usually caused by 
infection and characterised by the acute onset of diarrhoea. Multiplex 
gastrointestinal pathogen panel (GPP) tests simultaneously identify common 
bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens using molecular testing. By providing 
test results more rapidly than conventional testing methods, GPP tests might 
positively influence the treatment and management of patients presenting in 
hospital or in the community.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence for GPP tests [xTAG® (Luminex, 
Toronto, ON, Canada), FilmArray (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) 
and Faecal Pathogens B (AusDiagnostics, Beaconsfield, NSW, Australia)] and to 
develop a de novo economic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of GPP tests 
with conventional testing in England and Wales.
DATA SOURCES: Multiple electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of 
Science and the Cochrane Database were searched from inception to January 2016 
(with supplementary searches of other online resources).
REVIEW METHODS: Eligible studies included patients with acute diarrhoea; 
comparing GPP tests with standard microbiology techniques; and patient, 
management, test accuracy or cost-effectiveness outcomes. Quality assessment of 
eligible studies used tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
Studies-2, Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and 
Philips checklists. The meta-analysis included positive and negative agreement 
estimated for each pathogen. A de novo decision tree model compared patients 
managed with GPP testing or comparable coverage with patients managed using 
conventional tests, within the Public Health England pathway. Economic models 
included hospital and community management of patients with suspected 
gastroenteritis. The model estimated costs (in 2014/15 prices) and 
quality-adjusted life-year losses from a NHS and Personal Social Services 
perspective.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies informed the review of clinical evidence (17 xTAG, 
four FilmArray, two xTAG and FilmArray, 0 Faecal Pathogens B). No study provided 
an adequate reference standard with which to compare the test accuracy of GPP 
with conventional tests. A meta-analysis (of 10 studies) found considerable 
heterogeneity; however, GPP testing produces a greater number of 
pathogen-positive findings than conventional testing. It is unclear whether or 
not these additional 'positives' are clinically important. The review identified 
no robust evidence to inform consequent clinical management of patients. There 
is considerable uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of GPP panels used to 
test for suspected infectious gastroenteritis in hospital and community 
settings. Uncertainties in the model include length of stay, assumptions about 
false-positive findings and the costs of tests. Although there is potential for 
cost-effectiveness in both settings, key modelling assumptions need to be 
verified and model findings remain tentative.
LIMITATIONS: No test-treat trials were retrieved. The economic model reflects 
one pattern of care, which will vary across the NHS.
CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review and cost-effectiveness model identify 
uncertainties about the adoption of GPP tests within the NHS. GPP testing will 
generally correctly identify pathogens identified by conventional testing; 
however, these tests also generate considerable additional positive results of 
uncertain clinical importance.
FUTURE WORK: An independent reference standard may not exist to evaluate 
alternative approaches to testing. A test-treat trial might ascertain whether or 
not additional GPP 'positives' are clinically important or result in 
overdiagnoses, whether or not earlier diagnosis leads to earlier discharge in 
patients and what the health consequences of earlier intervention are. Future 
work might also consider the public health impact of different testing 
treatments, as test results form the basis for public health surveillance.

In 1999, the Australian Federal Government introduced Medicare items for Health 
Assessments for people aged 75 years and older (75+ health assessments). This 
research examined uptake of these assessments and identified predictors of use 
by women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). 
Assessments were identified for each year from 1999 to 2013 using linked 
Medicare data. Time to first assessment was examined, as well as social and 
health factors associated with having an assessment. From 1999 to 2013, 61.8% of 
women had at least one assessment. Almost one-third had an assessment within 2 
years of their introduction, 25% of women died before having an assessment and 
13% survived but did not have an assessment. Factors associated with assessment 
included being widowed, private health insurance, marital status, education, 
having arthritis and urinary incontinence, and less difficulty managing on 
income. Many women never received an assessment, and many only received one. 
Promotion of the 75+ health assessments is necessary among older women to 
increase uptake.

BACKGROUND: In 2010 a new diagnostic test for tuberculosis, Xpert MTB/RIF, 
received a conditional programmatic recommendation from WHO. Several model-based 
economic evaluations predicted that Xpert would be cost-effective across 
sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of Xpert in the real 
world during national roll-out in South Africa.
METHODS: For this real-world cost analysis and economic evaluation, we applied 
extensive primary cost and patient event data from the XTEND study, a pragmatic 
trial examining Xpert introduction for people investigated for tuberculosis in 
40 primary health facilities (20 clusters) in South Africa enrolled between June 
8, and Nov 16, 2012, to estimate the costs and cost per disability-adjusted 
life-year averted of introducing Xpert as the initial diagnostic test for 
tuberculosis, compared with sputum smear microscopy (the standard of care).
FINDINGS: The mean total cost per study participant for tuberculosis 
investigation and treatment was US$312·58 (95% CI 252·46-372·70) in the Xpert 
group and $298·58 (246·35-350·82) in the microscopy group. The mean health 
service (provider) cost per study participant was $168·79 (149·16-188·42) for 
the Xpert group and $160·46 (143·24-177·68) for the microscopy group of the 
study. Considering uncertainty in both cost and effect using a wide range of 
willingness to pay thresholds, we found less than 3% probability that Xpert 
introduction improved the cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis diagnostics.
INTERPRETATION: After analysing extensive primary data collection during 
roll-out, we found that Xpert introduction in South Africa was cost-neutral, but 
found no evidence that Xpert improved the cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis 
diagnosis. Our study highlights the importance of considering implementation 
constraints, when predicting and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new 
tuberculosis diagnostics in South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the world's largest 
anthropogenic source of mercury emission. Gold miners are highly exposed to 
metallic mercury and suffer occupational mercury intoxication. The global 
disease burden as a result of this exposure is largely unknown because the 
informal character of ASGM restricts the availability of reliable data.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of occupational mercury intoxication and 
the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to chronic metallic 
mercury vapor intoxication (CMMVI) among ASGM gold miners globally and in 
selected countries.
METHODS: Estimates of the number of artisanal small-scale gold (ASG) miners were 
extracted from reviews supplemented by a literature search. Prevalence of 
moderate CMMVI among miners was determined by compiling a dataset of available 
studies that assessed frequency of intoxication in gold miners using a 
standardized diagnostic tool and biomonitoring data on mercury in urine. Severe 
cases of CMMVI were not included because it was assumed that these persons can 
no longer be employed as miners. Cases in workers' families and communities were 
not considered. Years lived with disability as a result of CMMVI among ASG 
miners were quantified by multiplying the number of prevalent cases of CMMVI by 
the appropriate disability weight. No deaths are expected to result from CMMVI 
and therefore years of life lost were not calculated. Disease burden was 
calculated by multiplying the prevalence rate with the number of miners for each 
country and the disability weight. Sensitivity analyses were performed using 
different assumptions on the number of miners and the intoxication prevalence 
rate.
FINDINGS: Globally, 14-19 million workers are employed as ASG miners. Based on 
human biomonitoring data, between 25% and 33% of these miners-3.3-6.5 million 
miners globally-suffer from moderate CMMVI. The resulting global burden of 
disease is estimated to range from 1.22 (uncertainty interval [UI] 0.87-1.61) to 
2.39 (UI 1.69-3.14) million DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first global and country-based estimates of 
disease burden caused by mercury intoxication in ASGM. Data availability and 
quality limit the results, and the total disease burden is likely undercounted. 
Despite these limitations, the data clearly indicate that mercury intoxication 
in ASG miners is a major, largely neglected global health problem.

BACKGROUND: Fallopian tubes are commonly removed during laparoscopic and open 
hysterectomy to prevent ovarian and tubal cancer but are not routinely removed 
during vaginal hysterectomy because of perceptions of increased morbidity, 
difficulty, or inadequate surgical training.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to quantify complications and costs associated with a 
strategy of planned salpingectomy during vaginal hysterectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: We created a decision analysis model using TreeAgePro. 
Effectiveness outcomes included ovarian cancer incidence and mortality as well 
as major surgical complications. Modeled complications included transfusion, 
conversion to laparotomy or laparoscopy, abscess/hematoma requiring 
intervention, ileus, readmission, and reoperation within 30 days. We also 
modeled subsequent benign adnexal surgery beyond the postoperative window. Those 
whose procedures were converted from a vaginal route were assumed to undergo 
bilateral salpingectomy, regardless of treatment group, following American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Costs were gathered from 
published literature and Medicare reimbursement data, with internal cost data 
from 892 hysterectomies at a single institution used to estimate costs when 
necessary. Complication rates were determined from published literature and from 
13,397 vaginal hysterectomies recorded in the National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program database from 2008 through 2013.
RESULTS: Switching from a policy of vaginal hysterectomy alone to a policy of 
routine planned salpingectomy prevents a diagnosis of ovarian cancer in 1 of 
every 225 women having surgery and prevents death from ovarian cancer in 1 of 
every 450 women having surgery. Overall, salpingectomy was a less expensive 
strategy than not performing salpingectomy ($7350.62 vs $8113.45). Sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated the driving force behind increased costs was the increased 
risk of subsequent benign adnexal surgery among women retaining their tubes. 
Planned opportunistic salpingectomy had more major complications than 
hysterectomy alone (7.95% vs 7.68%). Major complications included transfusion, 
conversion to laparotomy or laparoscopy, abscess/hematoma requiring 
intervention, ileus, readmission, and reoperation within 30 days. Therefore, 
routine salpingectomy results in 0.61 additional complications per case of 
cancer prevented and 1.21 additional complications per death prevented. A 
surgeon therefore must withstand an additional ∼3 complications to prevent 5 
cancer diagnoses and ∼6 additional complications to prevent 5 cancer deaths.
CONCLUSION: Salpingectomy should routinely be performed with vaginal 
hysterectomy because it was the dominant and therefore cost-effective strategy. 
Complications are minimally increased, but the trade-off with cancer prevention 
is highly favorable.

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
pembrolizumab compared with standard-of-care (SoC) platinum-based chemotherapy 
as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) that expresses high levels of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) [tumour 
proportion score (TPS) ≥50%], from a US third-party public healthcare payer 
perspective.
METHODS: We conducted a partitioned-survival model with a cycle length of 1 week 
and a base-case time horizon of 20 years. Parametric models were fitted to 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time on treatment, progression-free survival and 
overall survival from the KEYNOTE-024 randomized clinical trial (patients aged 
≥18 years with stage IV NSCLC, TPS ≥50%, without epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
translocations who received no prior systemic chemotherapy) and validated with 
long-term registry data. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated 
based on EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility data collected in the trial. Costs 
($US, year 2016 values) for drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and 
clinical management were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per 
year. A series of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, pembrolizumab resulted in an expected gain 
of 1.31 life-years (LYs) and 1.05 QALYs and an incremental cost of $US102,439 
compared with SoC. The incremental cost per QALY gain was $US97,621/QALY and the 
incremental cost per LY gain was $US78,344/LY.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is projected to be a cost-effective option compared 
with SoC platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in adults with 
metastatic NSCLC expressing high levels of PD-L1.
