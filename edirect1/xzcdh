activity with HSP90 or HSP70 as substrates. By phosphorylating HSPs in the 
foldosome complex, MAPK1 may regulate the stability and activity of the 
foldosome which in turn plays a pivotal role in the parasitic life cycle of L. 
donovani. Our study therefore implicates LdMAPK1 in the post-translational 
modification and possibly the regulation of heat shock proteins. Conversely, 
HSP90 and HSP70 are identified as the first substrates of LdMAPK1.

INTRODUCTION: People with COPD have a decline in functional status, but little 
is known about the rate of decline and factors that contribute. Of particular 
concern is the decline in cognitive and functional performance. Decrease in 
cognitive and functional performance will finally lead to decreased health 
status, sedentary life style and premature frailty.
AIM: The aim of this study is to compare functional performance and cognitive 
status in patients with COPD of different ages and to examine the changes in 
extrapulmonary effects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 62 patients with COPD risk class D who 
were divided into two groups (<70 years, N=30 and >70 years, N=32). Patients 
first completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is a 30-point 
test that assesses different cognitive domains, while isometric knee extension 
(IKE) was measured using a digital handheld dynamometer, and functional exercise 
level was assessed using the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) test.
RESULTS: The patients' older age (age higher than 70 years) was associated with 
a significantly lower body mass index (BMI, 27.50 vs 24.24 kg/m2; P=0.020), 
higher vital capacity parameters, forced vital capacity (FVC, 2.74 vs 2.82 L; 
P=0.799), FVC (%) (73.00 vs 66.50, P=132), forced expiratory volume in the first 
second (FEV1, 0.93 vs 1.13 L; P=0.001) and FEV1 (%) (28.50 vs 30.50, P=0.605). 
In addition, patients at older age presented a significantly reduced physical 
activity capacity, 6MWD (385.93 vs 320.84 m, P<0.001) and IKE (24.75 vs 22.55 
kgf, P=0.005), as well as higher values for inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive 
protein (8.77 vs 3.34 mg/L, P=0.022). Moreover, patients at older age presented 
significantly lower score at the cognitive assessment, MoCA (23.50 vs 20.00, 
P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elderly COPD patients have reduced exercise capacity and muscle 
strength, deteriorated cognitive function and increased inflammatory markers. 
Furthermore, inflammation markers were significantly correlated with muscle 
strength, walking distance and cognitive impairment.

Using Expectancy Value Theory as a Framework to Reduce Student Resistance to 
Active Learning: A Proof of Concept.

University, Tempe, AZ 85281.

There has been a national movement to transition college science courses from 
passive lectures to active learning environments. Active learning has been shown 
to be a more effective way for students to learn, yet there is concern that some 
students are resistant to active learning approaches. Although there is much 
discussion about student resistance to active learning, few studies have 
explored this topic. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have applied 
theoretical frameworks to student engagement in active learning. We propose 
using a theoretical lens of expectancy value theory to understand student 
resistance to active learning. In this study, we examined student perceptions of 
active learning after participating in 40 hours of active learning. We used the 
principal components of expectancy value theory to probe student experience in 
active learning: student perceived self-efficacy in active learning, value of 
active learning, and potential cost of participating in active learning. We 
found that students showed positive changes in the components of expectancy 
value theory and reported high levels of engagement in active learning, which 
provide proof of concept that expectancy value theory can be used to boost 
student perceptions of active learning and their engagement in active learning 
classrooms. From these findings, we have built a theoretical framework of 
expectancy value theory applied to active learning.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a health problem which mainly effects elderly men 
and this problem has become a more important health problem with the increased 
life expectancy. The basic risk factors of ED are hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerotic heart disease which also have a higher 
incidence in the elderly men. The aim of this review article is to highlight the 
age-related changes in ED together with recommendations for patient evaluation 
and treatment.

Temperature-shuffled parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics accelerates 
the structural transitions of proteins.

Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.

Parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) is an enhanced 
conformational sampling method for searching structural transition pathways from 
a given reactant to a product. Recently, a temperature-aided PaCS-MD (Vinod et 
al., Eur. Biophys. J. 2016, 45, 463) has been proposed as its extension, in 
which the temperatures were introduced as additional parameters in 
conformational resampling, whereas the temperature is fixed in the original 
PaCS-MD. In the present study, temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD is proposed as a 
further extension of temperature-aided PaCS-MD in which the temperatures are 
shuffled among different replicas at the beginning of each cycle of 
conformational resampling. To evaluate their conformational sampling 
efficiencies, the original, temperature-aided, and temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD 
were applied to a protein-folding process of Trp-cage, and their minimum 
computational costs to identify the native state were addressed. Through the 
evaluation, it was confirmed that temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD remarkably 
accelerated the protein-folding process of Trp-cage compared with the other 
methods. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research that projects the public health and 
economic impact of healthcare interventions in the future. In this study, we 
aimed to estimate the public health and economic impact of vitamin D fortified 
dairy products for the years 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050 and 2060.
METHODS: We used a previously validated Markov microsimulation model that was 
designed to assess the public health and economic impact of dairy products for 
fracture prevention in the French general population aged over 60 years in the 
year 2015.
RESULTS: The expected benefit (in terms of fractures prevented) of the 
recommended intake of dairy products compared to the absence of appropriate 
intake is expected to increase by 63% in 2040 and by 85% in 2060. The cost per 
quality-adjusted life years gained of the appropriate intake of dairy products 
is expected to decrease from €58,244 in 2015 to €42,616 in 2060.
CONCLUSION: The potential public health and economic benefits of vitamin D 
fortified dairy products is expected to substantially increase in the future, 
especially in the population aged over 80 years. Decision makers should be aware 
of the current and future potential benefits of dairy products to protect bone 
fractures.

Indications of the Magnetic Resonance Method in Breast Pathology.

Chiriţă A.

The high incidence of breast cancer is a known fact. The 5-year survival rate 
for women with correctly treated breast cancer is 90% around the world, and 50% 
in Romania, respectively. Correct diagnostic evaluation of the breasts allows 
for a competent therapeutic management. The primary diagnosis of breast cancer 
includes clinical examination of the breasts, breast ultrasound and mammography. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination is not a first line type of 
investigation, but targeted to selected patient groups. MRI exam is indicated 
in: screening of breast cancer in women at high risk for breast cancer, in cases 
with equivocal diagnosis or with contradictory diagnoses at 
mammography-ultrasound examinations, and in patients with mammographically dense 
breasts. Mammary MRI exam is the best imaging method in assessing the real 
dimensions of the initial tumour, in the detection of multifocal and 
multicentric lesions and of nodular axillary post-lumpectomy lesions. Also, MRI 
exam is recommended for preoperative breast cancer staging, for assessment of 
the breast operated on, and for evaluating chemotherapy. Preoperative MRI 
assessment of the breast reduces the number of surgical interventions required 
to obtain surgical negative resection margins, decreases breast cancer 
recurrence rates, and increases long-term life expectancy (survival). MRI is a 
potential method for monitoring early responses during neoadjuvant therapy, 
identifying chemoresistant tumours, and allowing guided re-excision, as well as 
identifying residual tumours after completion of the neoadjuvant therapy course. 
The exam is very useful in diagnosing mammary pathology in men and is 
recommended prior to augmentation or reconstructive breast surgery, to 
appreciate the integrity of the breast implant.

In this scoping review, the evidence of the benefits of screening older people 
for the five most common types of cancer in Hong Kong, namely colorectal, lung, 
breast, liver, and prostate cancers, is discussed. Although cancer treatments 
can be extensive and a good prognosis is less likely if cancer is diagnosed at a 
late stage, screening programmes for older people in primary care remain a 
matter of contention. The general recommendation for the screening of older 
people is to adopt an individualised approach that takes account of not only age 
but also co-morbidity, life expectancy, harms and benefits, and patient's 
preference.

The Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila has two 
multifunctional 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase 
(MTAN) enzymes, MtaN-1 and MtaN-2, that differ from those in other bacteria. 
These proteins are essential for several metabolic pathways, including 
biological methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, methionine recycling, and 
bacterial quorum sensing. To gain insight into how these two proteins function, 
we determined four high-resolution crystal structures of MtaN-1 in its apo form 
and in complex with the substrates S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, 
5'-methylthioadenosine, and 5'-deoxyadenosine. We found that the domain 
structures were generally similar, although slight differences were evident. The 
crystal structure demonstrates that AhMtaN-1 has an extension of the binding 
pocket and revealed that a tryptophan in the active site (Trp199) may play a 
major role in substrate binding, unlike in other MTAN proteins. Mutation of the 
Trp199 residue completely abolished the enzyme activity. Trp199 was identified 
as an active site residue that is essential for catalysis. Furthermore, 
biochemical characterization of AhMtaN-1 and AhMtaN-2 demonstrated that AhMtaN-1 
exhibits inherent trypsin resistance that is higher than that of AhMtaN-2. 
Additionally, the thermally unfolded AhMtaN-2 protein is capable of refolding 
into active forms, whereas the thermally unfolded AhMtaN-1 protein does not have 
this ability. Examining the different biochemical characteristics related to the 
functional roles of AhMtaN-1 and AhMtaN-2 would be interesting. Indeed, the 
biochemical characterization of these structural features would provide a 
structural basis for the design of new antibiotics against A. hydrophila.

Antiviral Therapy in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C-related Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma Responding to Palliative Treatment.

Seoul, Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Advances in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment offer high 
sustained virologic response rates with minimal side-effects. However, benefits 
of eradicating HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients whose life 
expectancies are hard to be determined after palliative therapy still needs to 
be assessed. This study sought to evaluate prognostic factors for survival in 
HCV-related HCC patients that responded to the palliative HCC treatment to 
speculate whether treating HCV would be beneficial in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records 
of 97 patients that showed complete or partial response to the initial HCC 
treatment were included.
RESULTS: Receiving HCV treatment [hazard ratio (HR), 0.244; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.075-0.788; P=0.018] increased the survival, whereas partial 
response to the initial HCC treatment (HR, 1.795; 95% CI, 1.071-3.008; P=0.026) 
and increased Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (HR, 2.017; 95% CI, 1.196-3.403; 
P=0.009) reduced the survival. From 97 patients, 16 patients were eventually 
treated for HCV. The mean time from the last HCC therapy to HCV treatment was 
16.9±13.9 months. The median time of follow-up after HCV treatment was 10.0 
months (range, 3 to 47 mo). Among the HCV-treated patients 3 patients had HCC 
recurred. The time to progression in HCV-treated patients were significantly 
longer than those untreated for HCV (P=0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: Although treating HCV in HCC patient that undergo noncurative HCC 
treatment is still debatable, this study results carefully suggest that 
HCV-related HCC patients that responded to the initial HCC palliative treatment 
might benefit from HCV treatment.

BACKGROUND: This study compares handgrip strength and its association with 
mortality across studies conducted in Moscow, Denmark, and England.
MATERIALS: The data collected by the Study of Stress, Aging, and Health in 
Russia, the Study of Middle-Aged Danish Twins and the Longitudinal Study of 
Aging Danish Twins, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing was utilized.
RESULTS: Among the male participants, the age-standardized grip strength was 2 
kg and 1 kg lower in Russia than in Denmark and in England, respectively. The 
age-standardized grip strength among the female participants was 1.9 kg and 1.6 
kg lower in Russia than in Denmark and in England, respectively. In Moscow, a 
one-kilogram increase in grip strength was associated with a 4% (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94, 0.99) reduction in mortality 
among men and a 10% (HR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.86, 0.94) among women. Meanwhile, a 
one-kilogram increase in grip strength was associated with a 6% (HR = 0.94, 
95%CI: 0.93, 0.95) and an 8% (HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.90, 0.94) decrease in 
mortality among Danish men and women, respectively, and with a 2% (HR = 0.98, 
95%CI: 0.97, 0.99) and a 3% (HR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95, 0.98) reduction in 
mortality among the English men and women, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that, although absolute grip strength values 
appear to vary across the Muscovite, Danish, and English samples, the degree to 
which grip strength is predictive of mortality is comparable across national 
populations with diverse socioeconomic and health profiles and life expectancy 
levels.

DNA polymerases are present in all organisms and are important enzymes that 
synthesise DNA molecules. They are used in various fields of science, 
predominantly as essential components for in vitro DNA syntheses, known as PCR. 
Modern diagnostics, molecular biology and genetic engineering need DNA 
polymerases which demonstrate improved performance. This study was aimed at 
obtaining a new NeqSSB-TaqS fusion DNA polymerase from the Taq DNA Stoffel 
domain and a single-stranded DNA binding-like protein of Nanoarchaeum equitans 
in order to significantly improve the properties of DNA polymerase. The DNA 
coding sequence of Taq Stoffel DNA polymerase and the nonspecific DNA-binding 
protein of Nanoarchaeum equitans (NeqSSB-like protein) were fused. A novel 
recombinant gene was obtained which was cloned into the pET-30 Ek/LIC vector and 
introduced into E. coli for expression. The recombinant enzyme was purified and 
its enzymatic properties including DNA polymerase activity, PCR amplification 
rate, thermostability, processivity and resistance to inhibitors, were tested. 
The yield of the target protein reached approximately 18 mg/l after 24 h of the 
IPTG induction. The specific activity of the polymerase was 2200 U/mg. The 
recombinant NeqSSB-TaqS exhibited a much higher extension rate (1000 bp template 
in 20 s), processivity (19 nt), thermostability (half-life 35 min at 95°C) and 
higher tolerance to PCR inhibitors (0.3-1.25% of whole blood, 0.84-13.5 μg of 
lactoferrin and 4.7-150 ng of heparin) than Taq Stoffel DNA polymerase. 
Furthermore, our studies show that NeqSSB-TaqS DNA polymerase has a high level 
of flexibility in relation to Mg2+ ions (from 1 to 5 mM) and KCl or (NH4)2SO4 
salts (more than 60 mM and 40 mM, respectively). Using NeqSSB-TaqS DNA 
polymerase instead of the Taq DNA polymerase could be a better choice in many 
PCR applications.

Appearance of Abnormal Cardiothoracic Ratio of Fetuses with Hemoglobin Bart's 
Disease: Life Table Analysis.

[Article in English]

Objective To determine the timeline of the first appearance of an increased CT 
ratio of fetuses with hemoglobin (Hb) Bart's disease. Materials and Methods A 
prospective longitudinal study was conducted on pregnancies at risk for fetal Hb 
Bart's disease. Sonographic markers including cardiothoracic (CT) ratio and 
middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) were serially assessed 
and recorded from the first trimester. The definite diagnosis of fetal Hb Bart's 
disease based on DNA analysis (CVS), or fetal Hb typing (HPLC; cordocentesis) 
was performed at the first appearance of an increased CT ratio. Results Of 275 
pregnancies at risk, 64 fetuses were finally proven to be affected and life 
table analysis was performed. Most affected fetuses showed an increased CT ratio 
in late first trimester and early second trimester, with median time of the 
first appearance at 13 weeks and all affected fetuses were detected at 23 weeks 
or less. The CT ratio yielded a sensitivity of 100 % at a gestational age of 23 
weeks with a false-positive rate of 8 %. MCA-PSV appeared later than CT ratio. 
Only 9.4 % of affected cases developed abnormal MCA-PSV before an increased CT 
ratio. Conclusion The timeline of the first appearance of an increased CT ratio 
of fetuses with Hb Bart's disease was established. This may help us identify Hb 
Bart's disease among fetuses at risk in earlier gestation and proper schedules 
for serial ultrasound could be made more effectively.

Publisher: Ziel Bei Feten mit Hämoglobin(Hb)-Bart-Erkrankung wird der zeitliche 
Verlauf beginnend vom ersten Auftreten einer erhöhten kardiothorakalen 
(CT)-Ratio ermittelt. Material und Methoden Eine prospektive Langzeitstudie 
wurde in Schwangerschaften mit Risiko für fetale Hb-Bart-Erkrankung 
durchgeführt. Die sonografischen Marker einschließlich der CT-Ratio und der 
Messung der systolischen Spitzengeschwindigkeit der A. cerebri media (MCA-PSV) 
wurden ab dem ersten Trimenon seriell bestimmt und aufgenommen. Die Diagnose 
einer fetalem Hb-Bart-Erkrankung wurde aufgrund der DNA-Analyse (CVS) oder einer 
fetaler Hb-Typisierung (HPLC, Cordozentese) ab dem ersten Auftreten einer 
erhöhten CT-Ratio gestellt. Ergebnisse Von 275 Risikoschwangerschaften waren 
schließlich 64 Feten betroffen und es wurde eine Life-Table-Analyse 
durchgeführt. Die meisten betroffenen Feten zeigten eine erhöhte CT-Ratio im 
späten ersten und im frühen zweiten Trimenon, die erstmals im Median mit 13 
Wochen auftrat und bei allen betroffenen Feten spätestens bis zur 23. Woche 
entdeckt wurde. Die CT-Ratio ergab eine Sensitivität von 100 % in der 23. 
Schwangerschaftswoche bei einer Falschpositiv-Rate von 8 %. MCA-PSV erschien 
später als die CT Ratio. Nur 9,4 % der betroffenen Fälle entwickelten eine 
abnormale MCA-PSV vor der Erhöhung der CT-Ratio. Schlussfolgerung Der Verlauf 
des ersten Auftretens einer erhöhten CT-Ratio bei Feten mit HB-Bart-Erkrankung 
wurde ermittelt. Dies kann der Identifizierung von Feten mit Risiko für

Lifetime risks of kidney donation: a medical decision analysis.

Kiberd BA(1), Tennankore KK(1).

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the potential loss of life and the lifetime 
cumulative risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from live kidney donation.
DESIGN: Markov medical decision analysis.
SETTING: USA.
PARTICIPANTS: 40-year-old live kidney donors of both sexes and black/white race.
INTERVENTION: Live donor nephrectomy.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Potential remaining life years lost, quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) lost and added lifetime cumulative risk of ESRD from 
donation.
RESULTS: Overall 0.532-0.884 remaining life years were lost from donating a 
kidney. This was equivalent to 1.20%-2.34% of remaining life years (or 
0.76%-1.51% remaining QALYs). The risk was higher in male and black individuals. 
The study showed that 1%-5% of average-age current live kidney donors might 
develop ESRD as a result of nephrectomy. The added risk of ESRD resulted in a 
loss of only 0.126-0.344 remaining life years. Most of the loss of life was 
predicted to be associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not ESRD. Most 
events occurred 25 or more years after donation. Reducing the increased risk of 
death associated with CKD had a modest overall effect on the per cent loss of 
remaining life years (0.72%-1.9%) and QALYs (0.58%-1.33%). Smoking and obesity 
reduced life expectancy and increased overall lifetime risks of ESRD in 
non-donors. However the percentage loss of remaining life years from donation 
was not very different in those with or without these risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Live kidney donation may reduce life expectancy by 0.5-1 year in 
most donors. The development of ESRD in donors may not be the only measure of 
risk as most of the predicted loss of life predates ESRD. The study identifies 
the potential importance of following donors and treating risk factors 
aggressively to prevent ESRD and to improve donor survival.

Considering the increasing life expectancy of people with intellectual 
disabilities (ID), the importance of cooperation between services for people 
with ID and elderly care services has been stressed in Flanders and the 
Netherlands, as well as internationally. However, the prevalence, intensity and 
content of such a cooperation are yet unknown. In order to gain information to 
address this issue, an online-survey was delivered to directors of all nursing 
homes in Flanders (n = 781). 229 surveys were completed.In more than 75% of the 
nursing homes, people with ID were among the residents over the past decade. 
However, at the same time a lack of expertise has been identified as a barrier 
to provide them optimal care and support. Hence, the respondents point out that 
a cooperation with ID care services could be beneficial. Nevertheless, those 
partnerships only arose in a quarter of the nursing homes so far, primarily for 
the purpose of exchange of expertise. Intersectoral multidisciplinary 
consultations and intersectoral care team consultations have been taking place 
as well, be it mainly in the context of a persons' transition from an ID care 
service to a nursing home. Until now, radical cooperations which involve an 
exchange of staff, seem to be rather rare.

Why did life expectancy decline in the United States in 2015? A gender-specific 
analysis.

In 2015, age-adjusted mortality rates increased for 8 of the 10 leading causes 
of death in the United States. As a result, life expectancy declined by 0.17 
years for both women and men. The decline could be just an anomaly, or it could 
represent the start of a new trend of stagnation or decline in life expectancy, 
as some scholars have warned. The first step is to determine the sources of the 
decline. In this study we analyze the contribution of specific causes of death 
to the decline in men's versus women's life expectancy, as well as the 
mechanisms that generated the decline. With regard to mechanisms, we examine 
whether the decline in life expectancy resulted from reductions in the average 
age at death for most causes of death, or from a greater risk of dying of causes 
that disproportionately affect the young and middle-aged. Using CDC mortality 
data, we construct life tables for men and women separately, based on 20 
different underlying causes of death. We find that men's reduction in life 
expectancy was attributable primarily to changes in midlife mortality, with a 
greater risk of dying of causes such as accidental poisoning or homicide. The 
reduction in women's life expectancy, on the other hand, was attributable 
primarily to changes in old-age mortality, where the mean age at death for most 
causes (such as heart disease and mental illnesses) was lower in 2015 than it 
was in 2014. These gender-specific mechanisms that contributed to the decline in 
life expectancy are common to the major racial/ethnic groups, but the magnitude 
of the decline differs greatly across racial/ethnic groups. Future research can 
use the tools provided here to investigate in more detail how the 
gender-specific mechanisms of the 2015 decline differ by race.

INTRODUCTION: Otitis media is one of the most prevalent childhood diseases. The 
impact of otitis media on quality of life of Portuguese children is unknown, 
because of the unavailability of a tool validated in European Portuguese to 
assess this consequence of otitis media. The Otitis Media-6 questionnaire 
(Otitis Media-6) is the most frequently used tool to assess health-related 
quality of life in children with otitis media. This study aims to create a 
version in the Portuguese language and culturally adapted to Portugal of the 
otitis media-6 questionnaire.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Otitis Media-6 questionnaire was translated and 
culturally adapted to the Portuguese language and population. Then, to assess 
the instrument psychometric properties, it was applied to a sample of Portuguese 
children with chronic otitis media with effusion or recurrent acute otitis 
media.
RESULTS: The Portuguese version of Otitis Media-6 questionnaire demonstrated the 
following psychometric properties: construct validity for baseline (rs = 0.98) 
and change scores (rs = 0.97), internal consistency (α = 0.780), test-retest 
reliability (rs = 0.89) and responsiveness to clinical change (t(59) = 10.104).
DISCUSSION: The simplicity and brevity of application of the instrument make it 
ideal for use in research and in clinical practice, enabling a more objective 
assessment of the extension of the otitis media impact in children quality of 
life and a more targeted therapeutic decision.
CONCLUSION: The Portuguese version of the Otitis Media-6 questionnaire is a 
valid, reliable and sensitive instrument to evaluate the health-related quality 
of life in Portuguese children with otitis media.

Publisher: Introdução: A otite média é uma das doenças mais prevalentes na 
infância. O impacto da otite média na qualidade de vida das crianças portuguesas 
não é conhecido, devido à indisponibilidade de um instrumento validado em 
português europeu capaz de avaliar esta consequência da otite média. O 
questionário Otitis Media-6 é o instrumento mais frequentemente usado para 
avaliar a qualidade de vida relacionada com a saúde em crianças com otite média. 
Este estudo tem como objetivo criar uma versão em língua portuguesa 
e culturalmente adaptada a Portugal do questionário Otitis Media-6. Material e 
Métodos: O questionário Otitis Media-6 foi traduzido e culturalmente adaptado à 
língua e à população portuguesa. Em seguida, para avaliar as propriedades 
psicométricas do instrumento, o mesmo foi aplicado a uma população de crianças 
portuguesas com otite média crónica com efusão ou otite média aguda recorrente. 
Resultados: A versão portuguesa do questionário Otitis Media-6 demonstrou as 
seguintes propriedades psicométricas: validade de construção para os scores 
basal (rs = 0,98) e de mudança (rs = 0,97), consistência interna (α = 0,780), 
confiança teste-reteste (rs = 0,89) e resposta a alteração clínica (t(59) = 
10,104). Discussão: A simplicidade e brevidade de aplicação do instrumento 
tornam-no ideal para utilização em investigação e na prática clínica diária, 
possibilitando uma avaliação mais objetiva da extensão do impacto da otite média 
na qualidade de vida da criança e a tomada de decisões terapêuticas mais 
orientada.Conclusão: A versão portuguesa do questionário Otitis Media-6 é um 
instrumento válido, confiável e sensível para avaliação da qualidade de vida 
relacionada com a saúde em crianças portuguesas com otite média.

Epidemiological data relating to cancer and the ageing of the population 
highlight the need for oncology, geriatrics and palliative care to work more 
closely together. Geriatric and palliative care assessments in oncology are 
complex procedures and result in the modification of the oncological therapeutic 
choices. They have a significant impact on the methods of treatment of the 
patients concerned.

INTRODUCTION: Untreatable foot problems in diabetics may require lower extremity 
amputation, which has a high level of patient mortality. This high mortality 
rate is worse than most malignancies. The present study aimed to identify 
parameters that can be used to estimate survival in DM patients undergoing 
below-knee amputations for diabetic foot problems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 470 patients (299 males, 171 females) with a 
mean age of 64.32 years who underwent below-knee amputation for diabetic foot 
problems between 2004 and 2014 were enrolled in the study. The length of time 
from the operation to time of death was recorded in days. Patient details were 
obtained, including age during surgery, BMI, oral antidiabetic and insulin 
usage, dialysis therapy history, lower extremity endovascular intervention, 
previous amputation at the same extremity, the need for stump revision surgery 
during follow-up, and above-knee amputation at the same site. Biochemical test 
results of pre-operative HbA1c, ESR, and levels of CRP, BUN, and creatinine were 
also obtained.
RESULTS: A total of 333 patients (70.9%) died and 137 (29.1%) survived 
post-surgery. Survival rates were 90% in the first 7 days, 84% in the first 30 
days, and 64% after the first year. Patient median life expectancy post-surgery 
was 930 ± 106 days. Hemodialysis treatment (p = 0.001), endovascular 
intervention (p = 0.04), sex (p = 0.004), age (p = 0.001), BUN level 
(p = 0.001), and duration of insulin use (p = 0.003) were shown to be effective 
predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is low (<3 years) in DM patients requiring 
below-knee amputations for untreatable foot problems. Survival could be 
predicted by duration of insulin use, age, sex, and renal insufficiency.

BASTet: Shareable and Reproducible Analysis and Visualization of Mass 
Spectrometry Imaging Data via OpenMSI.

Rubel O, Bowen BP.

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a transformative imaging method that supports 
the untargeted, quantitative measurement of the chemical composition and spatial 
heterogeneity of complex samples with broad applications in life sciences, 
bioenergy, and health. While MSI data can be routinely collected, its broad 
application is currently limited by the lack of easily accessible analysis 
methods that can process data of the size, volume, diversity, and complexity 
generated by MSI experiments. The development and application of cutting-edge 
analytical methods is a core driver in MSI research for new scientific 
discoveries, medical diagnostics, and commercial-innovation. However, the lack 
of means to share, apply, and reproduce analyses hinders the broad application, 
validation, and use of novel MSI analysis methods. To address this central 
challenge, we introduce the Berkeley Analysis and Storage Toolkit (BASTet), a 
novel framework for shareable and reproducible data analysis that supports 
standardized data and analysis interfaces, integrated data storage, data 
provenance, workflow management, and a broad set of integrated tools. Based on 
BASTet, we describe the extension of the OpenMSI mass spectrometry imaging 
science gateway to enable web-based sharing, reuse, analysis, and visualization 
of data analyses and derived data products. We demonstrate the application of 
BASTet and OpenMSI in practice to identify and compare characteristic 
substructures in the mouse brain based on their chemical composition measured 
via MSI.

INTRODUCTION: Cannabis-based medicines (CBMs) may offer relief from symptoms of 
disease; however, their additional cost needs to be considered alongside their 
effectiveness. We sought to review the economic costs and benefits of prescribed 
CBMs in any chronic illness, and the frameworks used for their economic 
evaluation.
METHODS: A systematic review of eight medical and economic databases, from 
inception to mid-December 2016, was undertaken. MeSH headings and text words 
relating to economic costs and benefits, and CBMs were combined. Study quality 
was assessed using relevant checklists and results were synthesised in narrative 
form.
RESULTS: Of 2514 identified records, ten studies met the eligibility criteria, 
all for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Six contained economic 
evaluations, four studies reported utility-based quality of life, and one was a 
willingness-to-pay study. Four of five industry-sponsored cost-utility analyses 
for MS spasticity reported nabiximols as being cost-effective from a European 
health system perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for these five studies were £49,257 
(UK); £10,891 (Wales); €11,214 (Germany); €4968 (Italy); and dominant (Spain). 
Nabiximols for the management of MS spasticity was not associated with 
statistically significant improvements in EQ-5D scores compared with standard 
care. Study quality was moderate overall, with limited inclusion of both 
relevant societal costs and discussions of potential bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Prescribed CBMs are a potentially cost-effective add-on treatment 
for MS spasticity; however, this evidence is uncertain. Further investment in 
randomised trials with in-built economic evaluations is warranted for a wider 
range of clinical indications.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has 
changed with the introduction of radium-223, cabazitaxel, abiraterone and 
enzalutamide. To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients 
with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with 
docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic 
skeletal-related event and safety data obtained from indirect treatment 
comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event data for cabazitaxel were 
conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A Markov model combined 
these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and costs for metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal perspective. 
Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 
5-year (lifetime) time horizon.
RESULTS: Radium-223 resulted in €6092 and €4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 
higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, 
respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal 
a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone 
(cabazitaxel) at the informal €80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared 
with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted 
life-years (-0.06) and €7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 
being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 
compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and 
prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the 
lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration 
and adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Radium-223 may be a less costly treatment strategy offering similar 
gains in health benefits compared with abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide 
in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective.

Hospital of Heraklion, Medical School of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.

BACKGROUND: Covered biliary stents have shown significant effectiveness in the 
palliative management of patients with malignant biliary disease due to 
prevention of tumour ingrowth. However, stent dysfunction may still occur due to 
growth of tumour at the borders of the covered stent (tumour overgrowth). The 
aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a bare extension in the 
prevention of tumour overgrowth when covered stents are used in the palliative 
treatment of malignant biliary strictures.
