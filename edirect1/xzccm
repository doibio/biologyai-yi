functional, and oncological. The quality of the body of evidence was examined 
according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We also conducted a cost-utility 
analysis with a 1-year time horizon. The potential long-term benefits of 
robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for functional and oncological outcomes 
were also evaluated in a 10-year Markov model in scenario analyses. In addition, 
we conducted a budget impact analysis to estimate the additional costs to the 
provincial budget if the adoption of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were 
to increase in the next 5 years. A needs assessment determined that the 
published literature on patient perspectives was relatively well developed, and 
that direct patient engagement would add relatively little new information.
RESULTS: Compared with the open approach, we found robot-assisted radical 
prostatectomy reduced length of stay and blood loss (moderate quality evidence) 
but had no difference or inconclusive results for functional and oncological 
outcomes (low to moderate quality evidence). Compared with laparoscopic radical 
prostatectomy, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy had no difference in 
perioperative, functional, and oncological outcomes (low to moderate quality 
evidence). Compared with open radical prostatectomy, our best estimates 
suggested that robot-assisted prostatectomy was associated with higher costs 
($6,234) and a small gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (0.0012). The 
best estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $5.2 
million per QALY gained. However, if robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were 
assumed to have substantially better long-term functional and oncological 
outcomes, the ICER might be as low as $83,921 per QALY gained. We estimated the 
annual budget impact to be $0.8 million to $3.4 million over the next 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no high-quality evidence that robot-assisted radical 
prostatectomy improves functional and oncological outcomes compared with open 
and laparoscopic approaches. However, compared with open radical prostatectomy, 
the costs of using the robotic system are relatively large while the health 
benefits are relatively small.

The PJ Nicholoff Steroid Protocol for Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy and 
Adrenal Suppression.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD or Duchenne) is a progressive, life-limiting 
muscle-wasting disease that requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary care. This 
care, at minimum, should include neuromuscular, respiratory, cardiac, 
orthopedic, endocrine and rehabilitative interventions that address both the 
primary and secondary manifestations of the disease. The care needs of patients 
evolve over the cdourse of the disease and as they transition from childhood 
into young adulthood. In the past two decades, life expectancy has increased 
significantly by the use of corticosteroids and enhanced clinical management. 
Nevertheless, each year, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are admitted 
to emergency departments and intensive care units where medical expertise 
thrives, but where expertise in rare diseases, such as Duchenne, may not. 
Emergency care for patients with Duchenne can be as complex as the disease 
process itself. While any illness or injury may occur in a person with Duchenne, 
some acute scenarios are much more common in the context of the disease. Making 
decisions about the clinical care of a person with Duchenne who presents with an 
acute illness can be quite difficult - in part, because of the extensive use of 
corticosteroids, which can lead to adrenal suppression. The life of a person 
with Duchenne needing emergency care may therefore depend upon the ability of 
the clinician on duty in the emergency department to recognize and mitigate 
adrenal suppression resulting from corticosteroid dependence. With this in mind, 
and drawing from expertise and experience with other steroid-dependent diseases, 
the 'PJ Nicholoff Steroid Protocol' was developed. The purpose of this protocol 
is to provide clinicians information regarding the safe management of 
corticosteroid during emergency situations in patients who may have accompanying 
adrenal suppression. The protocol explains how to recognize the signs and 
symptoms of acute adrenal crisis, how to prevent it with supplemental stress 
doses of corticosteroids, and how to taper doses after emergency care in order 
to prevent corticosteroid withdrawal.

Cost-effectiveness of G5 Mobile continuous glucose monitoring device compared to 
self-monitoring of blood glucose alone for people with type 1 diabetes from the 
Canadian societal perspective.

AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) alone in 
people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) using multiple daily injections (MDI) from 
the Canadian societal perspective.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (v.9.0) was used to assess the long-term 
(50 years) cost-effectiveness of real-time CGM (G5 Mobile CGM System; Dexcom, 
Inc., San Diego, CA) compared with SMBG alone for a cohort of adults with 
poorly-controlled T1DM. Treatment effects and baseline characteristics of 
patients were derived from the DIAMOND randomized controlled clinical trial; all 
other assumptions and costs were sourced from published research. The accuracy 
and clinical effectiveness of G5 Mobile CGM is the same as the G4 Platinum CGM 
used in the DIAMOND randomized clinical trial. Base case assumptions included 
(a) baseline HbA1c of 8.6%, (b) change in HbA1c of -1.0% for CGM users vs -0.4% 
for SMBG users, and (c) disutilities of -0.0142 for non-severe hypoglycemic 
events (NSHEs) and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs) not requiring medical 
intervention, and -0.047 for SHEs requiring medical resources. Treatment costs 
and outcomes were discounted at 1.5% per year.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the base case G5 Mobile 
CGM vs SMBG was $33,789 CAD/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity 
analyses showed that base case results were most sensitive to changes in 
percentage reduction in hypoglycemic events and disutilities associated with 
hypoglycemic events. The base case results were minimally impacted by changes in 
baseline HbA1c level, incorporation of indirect costs, changes in the discount 
rate, and baseline utility of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis demonstrate that G5 Mobile CGM is 
cost-effective within the population of adults with T1DM using MDI, assuming a 
Canadian willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 CAD per QALY.

AIM: To assess the required characteristics (cost, sensitivity and specificity) 
of a pharmacogenomic test for being a cost-effective prevention of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors induced angioedema. Furthermore, we 
assessed the influence of only testing high-risk populations.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A decision tree was used.
RESULTS: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 and €80,000 per quality 
adjusted life year, a 100% sensitive and specific test may have a maximum cost 
of €1.30 and €1.95, respectively. When only genotyping high-risk populations, 
the maximum test price would be €5.03 and €7.55, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This theoretical pharmacogenomic test is only cost-effective at high 
specificity, high sensitivity and a low price. Only testing high-risk 
populations yields more realistic maximum test prices for cost-effectiveness of 
the intervention.

Chemical Synthesis Demonstrates That Dynamic O-Glycosylation Regulates the 
Folding and Functional Conformation of a Pivotal EGF12 Domain of the Human 
NOTCH1 Receptor.

The interaction of the human NOTCH1 receptor and its ligands is a crucial step 
in initiating the intracellular signal transductions, in which O-glycosylation 
of the extracellular EGF-like domain strongly affects multiple aspects of cell 
differentiation, development, and cancer biology. However, consequences of 
biosynthetic O-glycosylation processes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
Golgi on the folding of EGF domains remain unclear. Synthetic human NOTCH1 EGF12 
modules allow for new insight into the crucial roles of O-glycosylation in the 
folding and conformation of this pivotal domain. Here, we show for the first 
time that predominant O-glucosylation at Ser458 facilitates proper folding of 
the EGF12 domain in the presence of calcium ion, while the nonglycosylated 
linear EGF12 peptide affords large amounts of misfolded products (>50%) during 
in vitro oxidative folding. Strikingly, O-fucosylation at Thr466 prior to 
O-glucosylation at Ser458 totally impedes folding of EGF12 independent of 
calcium ion, whereas modification of the Fucα1→ moiety with β-linked GlcNAc 
dramatically enhances folding efficiency. In addition, we elicit that extension 
of the Glcβ1→ moiety with xyloses is a negative-regulation mechanism in the 
folding of EGF12 when synthesis of a trisaccharide (Xylα1→3Xylα1→3Glcβ1→) 
dominates over the posttranslational modification at Thr466. Comprehensive 
nuclear magnetic resonance studies of correctly folded EGF12 modules demonstrate 
that noncovalently bonded bridges between sugars and peptide moieties, namely 
sugar bridges, contribute independently to the stabilization of the antiparallel 
β-sheet in the ligand-binding region. Our results provide evidence that the 
dynamic O-glycosylation status of the EGF12 domain elaborated in the ER and 
Golgi strongly affects folding and trafficking of the human NOTCH1 receptor.

BACKGROUND: Due to significant achievements in reducing mortality and increasing 
life expectancy, the issue of disability from diseases and injuries, and their 
related interventions, has become one of the most important concerns of 
health-related research.
METHODS: Using data obtained from the GBD 2015 study, the present report 
provides prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of 310 diseases and 
injuries by sex and age in Iran and neighboring countries over the period 
1990-2015. Age-standardized rates of all causes of YLDs are presented for both 
males and females in 16 countries for 1990 and 2015. We present the percentage 
of total YLDs for 21 categories of diseases and injuries, the percentage of YLDs 
for age groups, as well as the ranking of the most prevalent causes and YLDs 
from the top 50 diseases and injuries in Iran.
RESULTS: In 2015, the burden of 310 diseases and injuries among the Iranian 
population was responsible for 8,357,878 loss of all-age total years, which is 
equal to 10.58% of total years lived per year. This differs from the neighboring 
countries, as it ranges from 9.05% in Turkmenistan to 13.36% in Russia. During 
the past 25 years, a remarkable decrease was observed in all-cause YLD rates in 
all 16 countries. Meanwhile, in all countries, the age-standardized rate of all 
causes of YLDs was higher in females than males.
CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, one of the remarkable changes in NCDs 
observed among the studied age groups was increased rate of YLDs from mental 
disorders, which was replaced by musculoskeletal disorders in older age groups 
in 2015.

BACKGROUND: Summary measures of health are essential in making estimates of 
health status that are comparable across time and place. They can be used for 
assessing the performance of health systems, informing effective policy making, 
and monitoring the progress of nations toward achievement of sustainable 
development goals. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and 
healthy life expectancy (HALE) as main summary measures of health. We assessed 
the trends of health status in Iran and 15 neighboring countries using these 
summary measures.
METHODS: We used the results of GBD 2015 to present the levels and trends of 
DALYs, life expectancy (LE), and HALE in Iran and its 15 neighboring countries 
from 1990 to 2015. For each country, we assessed the ratio of observed levels of 
DALYs and HALE to those expected based on socio-demographic index (SDI), an 
indicator composed of measures of total fertility rate, income per capita, and 
average years of schooling.
RESULTS: All-age numbers of DALYs reached over 19 million years in Iran in 2015. 
The all-age number of DALYs has remained stable during the past two decades in 
Iran, despite the decreasing trends in all-age and age-standardized rates. The 
all-cause DALY rates decreased from 47,200 in 1990 to 28,400 per 100,000 in 
2015. The share of non-communicable diseases in DALYs increased in Iran (from 
42% to 74%) and all of its neighbors between 1990 and 2015; the pattern of 
change is similar in almost all 16 countries. The DALY rates for NCDs and 
injuries in Iran were higher than global rates and the average rate in High 
Middle SDI countries, while those for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional disorders were much lower in Iran. Among men, cardiovascular 
diseases ranked first in all countries of the region except for Bahrain. Among 
women, they ranked first in 13 countries. Life expectancy and HALE show a 
consistent increase in all countries. Still, there are dissimilarities 
indicating a generally low LE and HALE in Afghanistan and Pakistan and high 
expectancy in Qatar, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Iran ranked 11th in terms of LE 
at birth and 12th in terms of HALE at birth in 1990 which improved to 9th for 
both metrics in 2015. Turkey and Iran had the highest increase in LE and HALE 
from 1990 to 2015 while the lowest increase was observed in Armenia, Pakistan, 
Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Iraq.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels and trends in causes of DALYs, life expectancy, and HALE 
generally show similarities between the 16 countries, although differences 
exist. The differences observed between countries can be attributed to a myriad 
of determinants, including social, cultural, ethnic, religious, political, 
economic, and environmental factors as well as the performance of the health 
system. Investigating the differences between countries can inform more 
effective health policy and resource allocation. Concerted efforts at national 
and regional levels are required to tackle the emerging burden of 
non-communicable diseases and injuries in Iran and its neighbors.

BACKGROUND: The Global burden of disease and injuries study (GBD 2015) reports 
expected measures for years of life lost (YLL) based on socio-demographic index 
(SDI) of countries, as well as the observed measures. In this extended GBD 2015 
report, we reviewed total and cause-specific deaths and YLL for Iran and all its 
neighboring countries between 1990 and 2015.
METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2015 database. Observed YLL measures 
were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by standard life expectancy 
at each age. SDI was a composite index, calculated based on income per capita, 
average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. The GBD world population 
was used for age standardization.
RESULTS: All-ages crude death rate in Iran reduced from 665.6 per 100,000 
population (95% uncertainty interval: 599.3-731.6) in 1990 to 487.2 
(414.9-566.1) in 2015. The ratio of observed to expected YLL (O/E ratio) for 
all-causes ranged between 0.54 (Turkey) and 1.95 (Russia) in 2015. For Iran, the 
all-causes O/E ratio was less than 1 in all years (1990-2015), except 2003. 
However, cause-specific O/E ratio was more than 1 for some causes, including the 
top leading causes of YLL (ischemic heart disease, road injuries, and 
cerebrovascular disorders). Ischemic heart disease was the first or second cause 
of YLL in all comparator countries except Afghanistan.
CONCLUSION: The leading YLL causes with high O/E ratios should be prioritized in 
public health efforts. In addition to research evidence, countries with low O/E 
ratios should be scrutinized to find feasible innovative interventions.

BACKGROUND: Iran and its neighboring countries represent four world regions with 
unique cultures and geography. Skin diseases span a wide diversity of etiologies 
including infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, vascular, neurogenic, and 
oncologic. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2015 measures the burden 
from skin diseases in 195 countries.
METHODS: Epidemiologic data were collected from literature review, survey data, 
and hospital inpatient/outpatient claims data. These raw data entered modeling 
using a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod MR-2.1, which yielded prevalence 
estimates by age/sex/location/year. Prevalence estimates were combined with 
disability weights to yield years lived with disability (YLDs). YLDs are 
combined with years of life lost (YLLs), from mortality estimates, to yield 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs were obtained for 16 skin 
conditions and both sexes in Iran and 15 surrounding countries. The 
sociodemographic index (SDI) for each country was also correlated with skin 
disease DALY rate using the Pearson coefficient (r) with two-tailed P-value.
RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between individual skin diseases 
and SDI. Acne and dermatitis caused the greatest burden and BCC the lowest 
burden of skin diseases in Iran and the other 15 countries. SCC and BCC were 
responsible for the largest discrepancy by sex, with higher burden in males 
compared to females.
CONCLUSION: Skin diseases, particularly dermatitis and acne, cause considerable 
burden in Iran and surrounding regions. Objective and transparent epidemiologic 
data such as GBD has the potential to inform and impact many facets of 
healthcare, research prioritization, public policy, and international 
partnerships.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by 
dysfunction of the CFTR gene. It is a multisystem disease that most often 
affects White individuals. In recent decades, various advances in the diagnosis 
and treatment of CF have drastically changed the scenario, resulting in a 
significant increase in survival and quality of life. In Brazil, the current 
neonatal screening program for CF has broad coverage, and most of the Brazilian 
states have referral centers for the follow-up of individuals with the disease. 
Previously, CF was limited to the pediatric age group. However, an increase in 
the number of adult CF patients has been observed, because of the greater number 
of individuals being diagnosed with atypical forms (with milder phenotypic 
expression) and because of the increase in life expectancy provided by the new 
treatments. However, there is still great heterogeneity among the different 
regions of Brazil in terms of the access of CF patients to diagnostic and 
therapeutic methods. The objective of these guidelines was to aggregate the main 
scientific evidence to guide the management of these patients. A group of 18 CF 
specialists devised 82 relevant clinical questions, divided into five 
categories: characteristics of a referral center; diagnosis; treatment of 
respiratory disease; gastrointestinal and nutritional treatment; and other 
aspects. Various professionals working in the area of CF in Brazil were invited 
to answer the questions devised by the coordinators. We used the PubMed database 
to search the available literature based on keywords, in order to find the best 
answers to these questions. RESUMO A fibrose cística (FC) é uma doença genética 
autossômica recessiva caracterizada pela disfunção do gene CFTR. Trata-se de uma 
doença multissistêmica que ocorre mais frequentemente em populações descendentes 
de caucasianos. Nas últimas décadas, diversos avanços no diagnóstico e 
tratamento da FC mudaram drasticamente o cenário dessa doença, com aumento 
expressivo da sobrevida e qualidade de vida. Atualmente, o Brasil dispõe de um 
programa de ampla cobertura para a triagem neonatal de FC e centros de 
referência distribuídos na maior parte desses estados para seguimento dos 
indivíduos. Antigamente confinada à faixa etária pediátrica, tem-se observado um 
aumento de pacientes adultos com FC tanto pelo maior número de diagnósticos de 
formas atípicas, de expressão fenotípica mais leve, assim como pelo aumento da 
expectativa de vida com os novos tratamentos. Entretanto, ainda se observa uma 
grande heterogeneidade no acesso aos métodos diagnósticos e terapêuticos para FC 
entre as diferentes regiões brasileiras. O objetivo dessas diretrizes foi reunir 
as principais evidências científicas que norteiam o manejo desses pacientes. Um 
grupo de 18 especialistas em FC elaborou 82 perguntas clínicas relevantes que 
foram divididas em cinco categorias: características de um centro de referência; 
diagnóstico; tratamento da doença respiratória; tratamento gastrointestinal e 
nutricional; e outros aspectos. Diversos profissionais brasileiros atuantes na 
área da FC foram convidados a responder as perguntas formuladas pelos 
coordenadores. A literatura disponível foi pesquisada na base de dados PubMed 
com palavras-chave, buscando-se as melhores respostas às perguntas dos autores.

BACKGROUND: Ageing is associated with a decline of motor function and ability to 
perform daily activities. Locomotive disorders are one of the major disorders 
resulting in adverse health condition in elderly people. Concept of Locomotive 
syndrome (LoS) was proposed to tackle the problems and prolong healthy life 
expectancy of people with locomotive disorders. To develop intervention strategy 
for LoS it is mandatory to investigate impairments, functional disabilities 
which people with locomotive disorder experience and to examine relationships 
among these parameters. For this purpose we have developed Geriatric Locomotive 
Function Scale-25 (GLFS-25). Though several physical performance tests were 
reported for identification or monitoring the severity of LoS, there are few 
studies reported on characteristics of disability which people with locomotive 
disorders experience. The aim of this study was to report the characteristics of 
ADL disabilities in elderly people with locomotive disorders in terms of numbers 
and degree of activity limitations.
METHODS: We organized a cohort study and recruited 314 participants aged 
65 years and over from five orthopedic clinics or nursing care facilities. This 
was a cross-sectional study to use the baseline data of such cohort. ADL 
disabilities were assessed using GLFS-25 scale arranging the GLFS-25 scores in 
ordinal levels using "R language" program. Numbers and degrees of activity 
limitations were determined and compared among the levels. Frequency of 
limitation in activities regarding social activity, housework, locomotion, 
mobility and self-care was compared among across the disability level.
RESULTS: The GLFS-25 score was mathematically categorized into 7 levels. The 
number of activity limitations and the degrees of each activity limitation were 
significantly greater in high GLFS-25 levels than in low levels. Difficulties in 
mobility appeared in less severe level, difficulties in domestic and social life 
appeared in moderately severe level, and difficulties in self-care appeared in 
advanced level.
CONCLUSIONS: High GLFS-25 score represented high degree of disability on ADLs. 
Concordant increase of numbers of activity limitation and severity progression 
in activity limitation may contribute to progression of disability. Activity 
limitation may occur in the following order: sports activity, walking, 
transferring, and self-care.

Objective To investigate whether the English health inequalities strategy was 
associated with a decline in geographical health inequalities, compared with 
trends before and after the strategy.Design Time trend analysis.Setting Two 
groups of lower tier local authorities in England. The most deprived, bottom 
fifth and the rest of England.Intervention The English health inequalities 
strategy-a cross government strategy implemented between 1997 and 2010 to reduce 
health inequalities in England. Trends in geographical health inequalities were 
assessed before (1983-2003), during (2004-12), and after (2013-15) the strategy 
using segmented linear regression.Main outcome measure Geographical health 
inequalities measured as the relative and absolute differences in male and 
female life expectancy at birth between the most deprived local authorities in 
England and the rest of the country.Results Before the strategy the gap in male 
and female life expectancy between the most deprived local authorities in 
England and the rest of the country increased at a rate of 0.57 months each year 
(95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.74 months) and 0.30 months each year (0.12 to 
0.48 months). During the strategy period this trend reversed and the gap in life 
expectancy for men reduced by 0.91 months each year (0.54 to 1.27 months) and 
for women by 0.50 months each year (0.15 to 0.86 months). Since the end of the 
strategy period the inequality gap has increased again at a rate of 0.68 months 
each year (-0.20 to 1.56 months) for men and 0.31 months each year (-0.26 to 
0.88) for women. By 2012 the gap in male life expectancy was 1.2 years smaller 
(95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.5 years smaller) and the gap in female life 
expectancy was 0.6 years smaller (0.3 to 1.0 years smaller) than it would have 
been if the trends in inequalities before the strategy had 
continued.Conclusion The English health inequalities strategy was associated 
with a decline in geographical inequalities in life expectancy, reversing a 
previously increasing trend. Since the strategy ended, inequalities have started 
to increase again. The strategy may have reduced geographical health 
inequalities in life expectancy, and future approaches should learn from this 
experience. The concerns are that current policies are reversing the 
achievements of the strategy.

The Math-Biology Values Instrument: Development of a Tool to Measure Life 
Science Majors' Task Values of Using Math in the Context of Biology.

In response to calls to improve the quantitative training of undergraduate 
biology students, there have been increased efforts to better integrate math 
into biology curricula. One challenge of such efforts is negative student 
attitudes toward math, which are thought to be particularly prevalent among 
biology students. According to theory, students' personal values toward using 
math in a biological context will influence their achievement and behavioral 
outcomes, but a validated instrument is needed to determine this empirically. We 
developed the Math-Biology Values Instrument (MBVI), an 11-item college-level 
self--report instrument grounded in expectancy-value theory, to measure life 
science students' interest in using math to understand biology, the perceived 
usefulness of math to their life science career, and the cost of using math in 
biology courses. We used a process that integrates multiple forms of validity 
evidence to show that scores from the MBVI can be used as a valid measure of a 
student's value of math in the context of biology. The MBVI can be used by 
instructors and researchers to help identify instructional strategies that 
influence math-biology values and understand how math-biology values are related 
to students' achievement and decisions to pursue more advanced 
quantitative-based courses.

PURPOSE: Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and 
disability from cancer in the U.S. Smoking prevalence varies by racial and 
ethnic group, and therefore the smoking-related burden of cancer is expected to 
vary accordingly.
METHODS: We estimated the cigarette smoking-attributable Disability-Adjusted 
Life Years (DALYs) lost to cancer, overall and within racial/ethnic groups, 
using published DALY estimates, smoking prevalence from survey data, and 
relative risks from large cohort studies.
RESULTS: In 2011, 2.6 million DALYs were lost to cancer due to cigarette smoking 
(27% of all DALYs lost to cancer). Smoking-attributable DALY rates were higher 
in men (968 per 100,000 people [95% confidence interval: 943-992]) than women 
(557 [540-574]). In combined sex analyses, DALY rates were higher in 
non-Hispanic Blacks (960 [934-983]) and non-Hispanic Whites (786 [768-802]) than 
in Hispanics (409 [399-421]) and non-Hispanic Asians (335 [320-350]).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking-attributable cancer burden was substantial in all racial 
and ethnic groups, underscoring the need for intensified tobacco cessation in 
all populations.

How Long a Life Is Enough Life?

Callahan D, Gaylin W.

Humans have long been troubled by the prospect of old age and its culmination in 
death. Whether to rebel against or accept this fate have been wrestled with down 
through the centuries. But new medical technologies and the growing science of 
aging have sided with rebellion. We know that aging can be pushed back and 
improved in its quality. That progress is well under way, but now intensified by 
many scientists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. In 2016, Mark Zuckerberg and 
Priscilla Chan pledged three billion dollars toward eventually "preventing, 
curing or managing all diseases." And some visionaries have made the elimination 
of death or its indefinite postponement a goal. To put those aspirations in a 
broader context, it is helpful to keep in mind where population growth and aging 
trends stand. Apart from any success in the explicit efforts to increase 
longevity, there will be a steady increase in the number of elderly 
worldwide-and a much higher percentage of the elderly as part of the overall 
population. Most of the largest changes will be in developing countries. They 
will be overburdened by the death of the elderly from expensive chronic 
diseases-already a vexing problem for affluent countries.
