Many recent studies point to increasing inequality in mortality in the United 
States over the past 20 years. These studies often use mortality rates in middle 
and old age. We used poverty level rankings of groups of U.S. counties as a 
basis for analyzing inequality in mortality for all age groups in 1990, 2000, 
and 2010. Consistent with previous studies, we found increasing inequality in 
mortality at older ages. For children and young adults below age 20, however, we 
found strong mortality improvements that were most pronounced in poorer 
counties, implying a strong decrease in mortality inequality. These younger 
cohorts will form the future adult U.S. population, so this research suggests 
that inequality in old-age mortality is likely to decline.

Extending life expectancy is a human achievement. It does however entail 
problems. Ophthalmic treatments are widely recognized as having a low risk of 
general complications. A classic example is cataract surgery, considered to be 
one of the safest and most frequently performed surgical procedures in the 
world. However, advanced age brings with it risks that should be considered 
before surgery. Eye operations, as with procedures on other organs, are largely 
dependent on the quality of surgical tissues. Therefore, the elderly are at 
increased risk of complications. Improved general health and postoperative 
follow-up with the use of noninvasive technologies such as optical coherence 
tomography translate into lower intraoperative risk and better postoperative 
prognosis. In this review, we discuss the impact of general health on 
operational prognosis, therapeutic problems, and technical difficulties which a 
surgeon and anesthesiologist may encounter in the process. We also consider new 
technology and strategies specifically aimed at treating eye conditions in the 
elderly.

OBJECTIVES: Low and middle income nations will experience an unprecedented 
growth of the elderly population and subsequent increase in age-related 
neurological disorders. Worldwide prevalence and incidence of all-types of 
neurological disorders with serious mental health complications will increase 
with life expectancy across the globe. One-in- ten individuals over 75 has at 
least moderate cognitive impairment. Prevalence of cognitive impairment doubles 
every 5 years thereafter. Latin America's population of older adult's 65 years 
and older is growing rapidly, yet little is known about cognitive aging among 
healthy older Latinos. Clinically significant depressive symptomatology is 
common among community-dwelling older adults and is associated with deficits 
across multiple cognitive domains, however much of the literature has not 
modeled the unique effects of depression distinct from negative and low positive 
affect. Our objective was to understand how mental health affects cognitive 
health in healthy aging Latinos.
METHODS: The present study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and 
structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relative effects of Negative 
Affect, Positive Affect and Geriatric Depression on Verbal Memory, Verbal 
Reasoning, Processing Speed, and Working Memory in healthy aging Latinos. Data 
was collected from a sample of healthy community dwelling older adults living in 
San Jose, Costa Rica. Modeling of latent variables attenuated error and improved 
measurement reliability of cognition, affect, and depression variables.
RESULTS: Costa Ricans enjoy a notoriety for being much happier than US citizens 
and are renowned as one of the happiest nations in the world in global surveys. 
This was born out in these data. Costa Rican affective profiles differed 
substantively from US profiles. Levels of negative affect and depression were 
similar to US samples, but their levels of positive affect were much higher. 
Cognitive performance of these Costa Rican older adults was similar to US-age 
and education matched peers. CFA and SEM found that increased depressive 
symptomatology had deleterious effects on Working Memory made up of subtest 
scores sampling simple attention and vigilance for numbers. Verbal Memory, 
Verbal Reasoning, and Processing Speed were not affected by self-reported 
Positive Affect, Negative Affect or Depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Costa Rican older adults were happy, as evidenced by the high ratio 
of positive affect to relatively low negative affect. Thus, we were somewhat 
surprised to find that depressive symptoms were selectively correlated to 
decrements in working memory and that negative and positive affect contributed 
negligible amounts of variance to any of the cognitive factors. Because of the 
methodological rigor of latent variable analysis, these results are very 
specific. The Working Memory factor is not contaminated with Speed of Processing 
or other measured cognitive factors. Likewise, the measured Geriatric Depression 
represents symptoms that are richly cognitive, not overtly affective.

BACKGROUND: Over the last decades, the arthroscopic treatment of hip pathology 
has highly grown thanks to the evolution of surgical and diagnostic techniques 
and instrumentation development. Furthermore the higher life expectancy and 
functional request make younger patients to be evaluated more frequently for 
non-arthrosic hip pathologies like labral lesion, FAI, cartilage tears. 
Treatment substantially has to be chosen between arthroscopy and arthrotomy. 
This study pretends to compare the clinical outcome between two different 
arthroscopic access techniques: the traditional one and the extrarticolar one 
(OUT-IN) we are using regularly in our clinic.
METHODS: From 2012 to 2014, 37 patients with FAI were treated with traditional 
technique (Group A) and 28 with extra-articular access (Group B). Indication to 
surgery treatment was given on the basis of radiological imaging (Pelvis Rx, Hip 
Rx in AP, Frog Leg view, Dunn view, Pelvic MRI) (8, 9), dynamic range of motion, 
clinical examination and functional scores (MHHS, MHOT). Pain was scored with 
NRS.  Minimum follow up for each patient was 12 month with clinical controls and 
functional score recording at 3-6-12 month after surgery. Complications or 
iatrogenic lesions were assessed.
RESULTS: At 12 month after surgery there was no statistically significant 
differences in hip R.O.M., MHHS and MHOT (33) score. We observed an higher 
number of iatrogenic lesions and complications in the group A (standard 
technique) than group B.
CONCLUSIONS: Hip arthroscopy is a viable and reproducible alternative technique 
when treating articular lesion such as femur-acetabular impingement and it is 
demonstrated by the increase of functional score. We can furthermore appreciate 
that an extra-articular access technique leads to a vary good outcome both in 
hip R.O.M. and functional scores and has a very low number of complications and 
iatrogenic lesions.

The life table developmental attributes of laboratory colonies of wild strains 
of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti were analyzed and compared based on the 
age-stage, two-sex life table. Findings inclusive in this study are: adult 
preoviposition periods, total preoviposition period, mean intrinsic rate of 
increase (r), mean finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rates (R0), and 
mean generation time (T). The total preadult development time was 9.47 days for 
Ae. albopictus and 8.76 days for Ae. aegypti. The life expectancy was 19.01 days 
for Ae. albopictus and 19.94 days for Ae. aegypti. Mortality occurred mostly 
during the adult stage. The mean development time for each stage insignificantly 
correlated with temperature for Ae. albopictus (r  =  -0.208, P > 0.05) and (r 
 =  -0.312, P > 0.05) for Ae. aegypti. The population parameters suggest that 
Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti populations are r-strategists characterized by a 
high r, a large R0, and short T. This present study provides the first report to 
compare the life parameters of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti strains from 
Penang island, Malaysia.

How to Invest in Getting Cost-effective Technologies into Practice? A Framework 
for Value of Implementation Analysis Applied to Novel Oral Anticoagulants.

Cost-effective interventions are often implemented slowly and suboptimally in 
clinical practice. In such situations, a range of implementation activities may 
be considered to increase uptake. A framework is proposed to use 
cost-effectiveness analysis to inform decisions on how best to invest in 
implementation activities. This framework addresses 2 key issues: 1) how to 
account for changes in utilization in the future in the absence of 
implementation activities; and 2) how to prioritize implementation efforts 
between subgroups. A case study demonstrates the framework's application: novel 
oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for the prevention of stroke in the National Health 
Service in England and Wales. The results suggest that there is value in 
additional implementation activities to improve uptake of NOACs, particularly in 
targeting patients with average or poor warfarin control. At a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained, additional investment in an educational activity that increases the 
utilization of NOACs by 5% in all patients currently taking warfarin generates 
an additional 254 QALYs, compared with 973 QALYs in the subgroup with average to 
poor warfarin control. However, greater value could be achieved with higher 
uptake of anticoagulation more generally: switching 5% of patients who are 
potentially eligible for anticoagulation but are currently receiving no 
treatment or are using aspirin would generate an additional 4990 QALYs. This 
work can help health services make decisions on investment at different points 
of the care pathway or across disease areas in a manner consistent with the 
value assessment of new interventions.

INTRODUCTION: The outcome of pathological fracture due to large aggressive 
benign stage 3 Dormans and Flynn lesions [6] is often unsatisfactory and the 
rate of recurrence is high. No single technique has been considered safe and 
successful. Many Authors suggested curettage and bone grafting as the unique 
effective treatment in cases of large defect but, because of the invasive and 
complex nature of the operation (it needs a double-step procedure), it is not 
preferred. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a 
minimally invasive treatment in one step through ESIN, curettage and packing 
with self-setting calcium phosphate cement.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 116 children admitted at 
the Division of Pediatric Orthopaedics Surgery of Santobono Children Hospital 
between 2006 and 2014 with a diagnosis of pathological fracture due to large 
aggressive ostheolytic benign lesions (stage 3 Dormans and Flynn). The size of 
bone loss was measured on the AP and ML radiographs and all the cysts with a 
caudo cranial extension from 5 to 8cm and with a medio lateral extension from 3 
to 5cm were included. Mean time follow up 24 months was performed.
RESULTS: The three-in-one procedure was applied in all 116 patients. After two 
years of follow up, 113 patients were classified as healed and just 3 required 3 
years to complete heal. No severe life threatening adverse effects or 
complications associated with the use of ESIN and injectable HA were recorded 
during the follow up period of 24-36 months. Fracture healing occurred in all 
cases within 4-6 weeks with adequate periosteal and endosteal callus formation. 
No second pathological fractures occurred in our series as well as no cysts 
reoccurred. Patients with humeral localizations showed a more rapid regain of 
muscular function and reestablishment of a complete range of motion.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed three-in-one procedure has shown to be efficient, 
cost-effective, associated to high rates of definitive bone healing and low 
incidence of adverse effects.

OBJECTIVES: Using cost-utility analysis, to evaluate whether or not to adopt a 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B vaccination programme for Israeli children.
METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic 
data were integrated into a spreadsheet model to calculate the cost per averted 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of the intervention.
RESULTS: Assuming 78 % vaccine efficacy with no herd immunity, vaccination will 
prevent 223 cases and 22 deaths over a 100-year period. Based on vaccine price 
of $60 per dose, total intervention costs ($315,400,000) are partially offset by 
a $22,700,000 reduction in treatment and sequelae costs as a result of decreased 
morbidity. The intervention was not cost-effective since the net cost 
($292,700,000) per averted DALY gained (1249 mostly due to decreased mortality) 
was $234,394. Additional two dose catch-up programmes vaccinating children in 
cohorts aged 1-2 to 1-13 were also not cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The vaccination will become cost-effective if vaccine costs fall 
below $19.44 per dose. However, in identified high risk areas, the vaccine would 
be cost-effective and could be recommended for use both with and without 
catch-up campaigns.

Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a noncommunicable disease that has attained great 
significance in the sub-Saharan region, with Nigeria being the most affected. 
Many persons with the condition suffer a reduced life expectancy and quality of 
life. Diabetes places an extra burden on the individuals and families affected, 
especially for the majority of patients unable to access quality health care.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the elements of diabetes management in Nigeria, areas for 
improvement, and proposed strategies to optimize care.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on diabetes in Nigeria. 
Local and nonindexed literature, PubMed, and Google Scholar were used to source 
information on the subject.
FINDINGS: Diabetes-related morbidity and mortality continue to increase due to 
population expansion, urban migration, declining physical activity, and dietary 
factors. The organization of diabetes care is poorly coordinated, especially at 
the primary and secondary tiers of the public health care system, with 
consequent poor outcomes. Thus life expectancy (just about 50 years), which is 
low in the region, is further reduced by the double jeopardy of communicable 
(eg, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria) and noncommunicable diseases, such as 
diabetes and its closely related comorbidity, hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The way forward is to improve maternal and child care, promote 
screening of at-risk populations, and develop strategies for primary prevention 
and early intervention to optimize glycemic control. Greater commitment to 
health care by the government and nongovernmental organizations and greater 
awareness by Nigerians should facilitate the desired improvements in disease 
prevention and glycemic control in those who are already affected.

BACKGROUND: International studies of the health of Indigenous and tribal peoples 
provide important public health insights. Reliable data are required for the 
development of policy and health services. Previous studies document poorer 
outcomes for Indigenous peoples compared with benchmark populations, but have 
been restricted in their coverage of countries or the range of health 
indicators. Our objective is to describe the health and social status of 
Indigenous and tribal peoples relative to benchmark populations from a sample of 
countries.
METHODS: Collaborators with expertise in Indigenous health data systems were 
identified for each country. Data were obtained for population, life expectancy 
at birth, infant mortality, low and high birthweight, maternal mortality, 
nutritional status, educational attainment, and economic status. Data sources 
consisted of governmental data, data from non-governmental organisations such as 
UNICEF, and other research. Absolute and relative differences were calculated.
FINDINGS: Our data (23 countries, 28 populations) provide evidence of poorer 
health and social outcomes for Indigenous peoples than for non-Indigenous 
populations. However, this is not uniformly the case, and the size of the rate 
difference varies. We document poorer outcomes for Indigenous populations for: 
life expectancy at birth for 16 of 18 populations with a difference greater than 
1 year in 15 populations; infant mortality rate for 18 of 19 populations with a 
rate difference greater than one per 1000 livebirths in 16 populations; maternal 
mortality in ten populations; low birthweight with the rate difference greater 
than 2% in three populations; high birthweight with the rate difference greater 
than 2% in one population; child malnutrition for ten of 16 populations with a 
difference greater than 10% in five populations; child obesity for eight of 12 
populations with a difference greater than 5% in four populations; adult obesity 
for seven of 13 populations with a difference greater than 10% in four 
populations; educational attainment for 26 of 27 populations with a difference 
greater than 1% in 24 populations; and economic status for 15 of 18 populations 
with a difference greater than 1% in 14 populations.
INTERPRETATION: We systematically collated data across a broader sample of 
countries and indicators than done in previous studies. Taking into account the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals, we recommend that national governments develop 
targeted policy responses to Indigenous health, improving access to health 
services, and Indigenous data within national surveillance systems.

The first cases of HIV infection in India were detected in 1986 among female sex 
workers in Chennai. A rapid increase followed in many states. The current 
national prevalence is about 0.26% compared with a global average of 0.2%, but 
the figure in most high-risk groups including female sex workers is much higher 
(up to 7%). New HIV infections reached a peak in 1998 and have since declined by 
60%, although the total number of HIV-positive persons remains stable at 
2.1 million, largely probably due to the increased life expectancy following 
antiretroviral therapy. The Indian epidemic is characterized by low levels in 
the general population and elevated concentrations among high-risk groups. 
Transmission is mainly heterosexually driven, with differential burdens across 
the states. The four main drivers of HIV infection in India differ in order from 
those elsewhere in the world and are commercial sex work, general heterosexual 
intercourse, injecting drug use and unprotected anal sex between men who have 
sex with men. There are distinct differences from state to state in the 
prevalence of HIV, with some around the national norm of 0.21% but others with 
over 1% infected. India has embarked on a targeted HIV prevention strategy in 
recent years which is strongly associated with a fall in infection rate in both 
low- and high-risk groups.

Alpha-synuclein (syn) is the main component of proteinaceous inclusions known as 
Lewy bodies (LBs), which are implicated in the pathogenesis of the 
neurodegenerative diseases known as synucleinopathies, like Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Aging is a major risk factor for PD and thus, interventions that delay 
aging will have promising effects in PD and other synucleinopathies. Caloric 
restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention shown to promote lifespan 
extension in several model organisms. CR has been shown to alleviate syn 
toxicity and herein we confirmed the same effect on the yeast model for 
synucleinopathies during chronological lifespan. The data gathered showed that 
TOR1 deletion also results in similar longevity extension and abrogation of syn 
toxicity. Intriguingly, these interventions were associated with decreased 
autophagy, which was maintained at homeostatic levels. Autophagy maintenance at 
homeostatic levels promoted by CR or TOR1 abrogation in syn-expressing cells was 
achieved by decreasing Sir2 levels and activity. Furthermore, the opposite 
function of Tor1 and Sir2 in autophagy is probably associated with the 
maintenance of autophagy activity at homeostatic levels, a central event linked 
to abrogation of syn toxicity promoted by CR.

Bexsero, a new vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease (MenB), was 
licensed in Europe in January 2013. In Germany, Bexsero is recommended for 
persons at increased risk of invasive meningococcal disease, but not for 
universal childhood vaccination. To support decision making we adapted the 
independently developed model for England to the German setting to predict the 
potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination with 
Bexsero(®) against MenB disease. We used both cohort and transmission dynamic 
mathematical models, the latter allowing for herd effects, to consider the 
impact of vaccination on individuals aged 0-99 years. Vaccination strategies 
included infant and adolescent vaccination, alone or in combination, and with 
one-off catch-up programmes. German specific data were used where possible from 
routine surveillance data and the literature. We assessed the impact of 
vaccination through cases averted and quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained 
and calculated costs per QALY gained. Assuming 65% vaccine uptake and 82% strain 
coverage, infant vaccination was estimated to prevent 15% (34) of MenB cases 
over the lifetime of one birth cohort. Including herd effects from vaccination 
increased the cases averted by infant vaccination to 22%, with an estimated 8461 
infants requiring vaccination to prevent one case. In the short term the 
greatest health benefit is achieved through routine infant vaccination with 
large-scale catch-up, which could reduce cases by 24.9% after 5 years and 27.9% 
after 10 years. In the long term (20+ years) policies including routine 
adolescent vaccination are most favourable if herd effects are assumed. Under 
base case assumptions with a vaccine list price of €96.96 the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was >€500,000 per QALY for all considered 
strategies. Given the current very low incidence of MenB disease in Germany, 
universal vaccination with Bexsero(®) would prevent only a small absolute number 
of cases, at a high overall cost.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality estimates of ovarian cancer based on 
human development are essential for planning by policy makers. This study is 
aimed at investigating the standardised incidence rates (SIR) and standardised 
mortality rates (SMR) of ovarian cancer and their relationship with the Human 
Development Index (HDI) in Asian countries.
METHODS: This study was an ecologic study in Asia for assessment of the 
correlation between SIR, age standardised rates (ASR), and HDI and their 
details, including life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, and gross 
national income (GNI) per capita. We used the correlation bivariate method for 
assessment of the correlation between ASR and HDI, and its details. Statistical 
significance was assumed if P < 0.05. All reported P-values were two-sided. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 15.0, SPSS Inc.).
RESULTS: The highest SIR of ovarian cancer was observed in Singapore, 
Kazakhstan, and Brunei respectively. Indonesia, Brunei, and Afghanistan had the 
highest SMR. There was a positive correlation between the HDI and SIR (r = 
0.143, p = 0.006). Correlation between SMR of ovarian cancer and HDI was not 
significant (r = 0.005, p = 052.0).
CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, between the HDI and SIR, 
there was a positive correlation, but there was no correlation between the SMR 
and HDI.

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression: 
An Economic Analysis.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Tu HA, Palimaka S, Sehatzadeh S, Blackhouse G, Yap B, Tsoi B, 
Bowen J, O'Reilly D.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD, 10% over a person's lifetime) is 
common and costly to the health system. Unfortunately, many MDD cases are 
resistant to treatment with antidepressant drugs and require other treatment to 
reduce or eliminate depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has long been 
used to treat persons with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Despite its 
effectiveness, ECT has side effects that make patients intolerant to the 
treatment, or they refuse to use it. Repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS), which has fewer side effects than ECT and might be an 
alternative for TRD patients who are ineligible for or unwilling to undergo ECT, 
has been developed to treat TRD.
OBJECTIVES: This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of rTMS for patients 
with TRD compared with ECT or sham rTMS and estimates the potential budgetary 
impact of various levels of implementation of rTMS in Ontario.
REVIEW METHODS: A cost-utility analysis compared the costs and health outcomes 
of two treatments for persons with TRD in Ontario: rTMS alone compared with ECT 
alone and rTMS alone compared with sham rTMS. We calculated the six-month 
incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for these treatments. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the model's results. A 1-year budget impact analysis estimated the 
costs of providing funding for rTMS. The base-case analysis examined the 
additional costs for funding six centres, where rTMS infrastructure is in place. 
Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored the impact of increasing diffusion of 
rTMS to centres with existing ECT infrastructure. All analyses were conducted 
from the Ontario health care payer perspective.
RESULTS: ECT was cost effective compared to rTMS when the willingness to pay is 
greater than $37,640.66 per QALY. In the base-case analysis, which had a 
six-month time horizon, the cost and effectiveness for rTMS was $5,272 and 0.31 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost and effectiveness for ECT were 
$5,960 and 0.32 QALYs. This translates in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $37,640.66 per QALY gained for ECT compared to rTMS. When rTMS is 
compared with sham rTMS, an additional $2,154.33 would be spent to gain 0.02 
QALY. This translates to an ICER of $98,242.37 per QALY gained. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of rTMS being cost-effective 
compared to sham rTMS was 2% and 45% at the thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 
per QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be cost-effective 
compared to sham treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression, 
depending on the willingness-to-pay threshold.

INTRODUCTION: Revision arthroplasty of the hip is becoming increasingly 
important in recent years. Early primary arthroplasty and longer life expectancy 
of the patients increases the number of revision surgery. Revision surgery of 
hip arthroplasty is major surgery for the patients, especially the elderly, with 
significant risks concerning the general condition of the patient. The aim of 
this work is to evaluate the outcome of bipolar hip arthroplasty as a salvage 
procedure for treatment of loosening of the acetabular cup with significant 
acetabular bone defects after total hip replacement (THR) in multi-morbid 
patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period from January 1(st) 2007 to December 
31(st) 2011 19 revision hip surgeries were performed in 19 patients, in which 
the loosened acetabular cup was replaced by a bipolar head. The examined patient 
group consisted exclusively of female patients with an average of 75 years. The 
predominant diagnosis was "aseptic loosening" (84.2%). All patients in our study 
were multi-morbid. We decided to resort to bipolar hip arthroplasty due to the 
compromised general condition of patients and the major acetabular bone defects, 
which were confirmed intraoperatively. The postoperative follow-up ranged from 
0.5 to 67 months (average 19.1 months).
RESULTS: Evaluation of the modified Harris Hip Score showed an overall 
improvement of the function of the hip joint after surgery of approximately 45%. 
Surgery was less time consuming and thus adequate for patients with 
significantly poor general health condition. We noticed different complications 
in a significant amount of patients (68.4%). The most common complication 
encountered was the proximal migration of the bipolar head. The rate of revision 
following the use of bipolar hip arthroplasty in revision surgery of the hip in 
our patients was high (21%). Despite the high number of complications reported 
in our study, we have noticed significant improvement of hip joint function as 
well as subjective pain relief in the majority of patients. We clearly achieved 
clinically satisfactory results in 14 patients.
CONCLUSION: Bipolar hip arthroplasty is by no means to be regarded as standard 
procedure in revision surgery of THR. It provides an option or salvage procedure 
for patients with poor general condition in whom the quickest possible surgical 
intervention preserving mobility is required. This is particularly true for 
multi-morbid patients in whom sufficient acetabular fixation is not possible.

Publisher: Einleitung: Die Anzahl der Revisionsendoprothetik am Hüftgelenk 
steigt durch Zunahme der frühen Erstimplantationen und der längeren 
Lebenserwartung der Patienten. Die Revisionsoperation ist mit einem hohen 
operativen Aufwand verbunden und bedeutet für den Patienten ein nicht 
unerhebliches Risiko. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Evaluierung der 
Duokopfendoprothese als Rückzugsmöglichkeit bei Pfannenlockerung mit 
acetabulären Knochendefekten bei multimorbiden Patienten.Patienten und Methode: 
Im Zeitraum vom 1. Januar 2007 bis 31. Dezember 2011 wurden 19 
Revisionsoperationen bei 19 Patienten durchgeführt, bei denen eine Pfanne gegen 
eine Duokopfendoprothese ausgetauscht wurde. Die untersuchte Patientengruppe 
bestand ausschließlich aus weiblichen Patienten, das Alter der Patientinnen lag 
zum Zeitpunkt der Wechseloperation auf eine Duokopfendoprothese im Mittel bei 75 
Jahren. Die häufigste Diagnose war aseptische Lockerung (84,2%). Alle 
Patientinnen unserer Studie waren multimorbide. Die Entscheidung zu der 
Duokopfendoprothese als Sekundärendoprothese wurde aufgrund der Multimorbidität 
bei intraoperativ desolatem knöchernen Befund der Hüftpfanne getroffen. Die 
postoperative Nachbeobachtungszeit betrug zwischen 0,5 und 67 Monaten 
(Durchschnitt 19,1 Monate). Ergebnisse: Das Gesamtergebnis der operativen 
Versorgung an Hand des modifizierten Harris Hip Score ergab eine Verbesserung 
der Funktionalität von ca. 45%.Die Operationen waren weniger zeitaufwendig und 
damit für Patienten mit signifikant schlechtem Gesundheitszustand angemessen. 
Bei vielen Patienten (68,4%) sind verschiedene Komplikationen aufgetreten. Die 
häufigste Komplikation war die proximale Migration des Duokopfes.Trotz der hohen 
Anzahl von Komplikationen in unserer Studie konnten wir eine signifikante 
Verbesserung der Hüftgelenksfunktion sowie subjektive Schmerzlinderung bei der 
Mehrzahl der Patienten verzeichnen. Bei 14 Patienten wurden klinisch 
zufriedenstellende Ergebnisse erreicht. Dennoch war die Revisionsrate in unserem 
Patientengut hoch (21%).Fazit: Die Duokopfendoprothese ist keineswegs als 
Standardverfahren bei der operativen Behandlung von Pfannenlockerungen zu 
betrachten. Sie stellt eine Option bzw. Rückzugsmöglichkeit bei multimorbiden 
Patienten dar, bei denen die schnellstmögliche, aber mobilitätserhaltende 
operative Intervention erforderlich ist, dar. Insbesondere gilt dies für 
multimorbide Patienten, bei denen eine erneute Pfannenfixation auf Grund der 
erheblichen knöchernen Defekte nicht erfolgversprechend mit vertretbarem Aufwand 
möglich ist.

Beef samples from grazing steers finished with different seed-supplemented diets 
were vacuum packaged for 3, 14 and 56days (VC) and subsequently exposed to 
aerobic conditions (AE) for 0 and 5days. Different fluorescent compounds of 
interest in the oxidation process were detected in meat, namely tryptophan 
residues, Schiff bases and porphyrins. Tryptophan intensity fluorescence 
increased with 14days of VC; while Schiff bases intensity increased (P<0.05) in 
beef samples stored under VC-56 and in all samples after AE-5days. Porphyrins 
increased (P<0.05) gradually with the extension of vacuum storage time, but were 
degraded in beef with long vacuum storage and 5days of AE. Higher levels of 
porphyrins in beef under VC were correlated (P<0.05) with lower redness and 
higher TBARS after AE-5. This study revealed the potential of fluorescence 
signals to detect oxidative changes in beef under different storage conditions 
using a fast and nondestructive method such as fluorescence spectroscopy.

Background Increasing life expectancy makes cardiac surgery in octogenarians not 
very uncommon. In this study, the impact of gender on outcome of octogenarians 
after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was assessed. Materials and 
Methods We retrospectively studied 485 octogenarians (176 females: mean age 
82.4 ± 2.2 years vs. 306 males: mean age 82.2 ± 2.4 years) who underwent 
isolated CABG using extracorporeal circulation between January 2005 and December 
2012. Results No significant differences were noted between both gender groups 
with regard to preoperative risk factors. At baseline, the groups differed 
significantly with respect to mean logistic European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) (women: 22.3 ± 17.4% vs. men: 
17.5 ± 13.3%; p < 0.001). Likewise, EuroSCORE II differs significantly between 
women and men in our cohort (women: 16.7 ± 11.9% vs. men: 13.9 ± 10.7%; 
p = 0.008). Intraoperatively, the number of distal anastomoses (3.1 ± 0.9 vs. 
3.2 ± 0.8), the mean extracorporeal circulation time (99 ± 31 vs. 102 ± 29 
minutes), and the mean aortic cross-clamp time (63 ± 31 vs. 60 ± 19 minutes) 
were similar in both groups. Postoperatively, no significant differences in 
complications and major morbidity were observed between the groups. The 30-day 
mortality (women 8.0 vs. men 9.7%; p = 0.62) were without statistical 
significance between the groups. Conclusion Outcome of octogenarians after CABG 
resulted in acceptable mortality. Female gender was not associated with 
increased risks for morbidity and mortality after surgery. Satisfactory outcomes 
encourage the offering of surgery in octogenarians.
