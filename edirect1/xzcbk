BACKGROUND: On the basis of encouraging preliminary results, we conducted a 
randomized, controlled trial to determine whether minocycline reduces the risk 
of conversion from a first demyelinating event (also known as a clinically 
isolated syndrome) to multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: During the period from January 2009 through July 2013, we randomly 
assigned participants who had had their first demyelinating symptoms within the 
previous 180 days to receive either 100 mg of minocycline, administered orally 
twice daily, or placebo. Administration of minocycline or placebo was continued 
until a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was established or until 24 months after 
randomization, whichever came first. The primary outcome was conversion to 
multiple sclerosis (diagnosed on the basis of the 2005 McDonald criteria) within 
6 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes included conversion to multiple 
sclerosis within 24 months after randomization and changes on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at 6 months and 24 months (change in lesion volume on T2-weighted 
MRI, cumulative number of new lesions enhanced on T1-weighted MRI ["enhancing 
lesions"], and cumulative combined number of unique lesions [new enhancing 
lesions on T1-weighted MRI plus new and newly enlarged lesions on T2-weighted 
MRI]).
RESULTS: A total of 142 eligible participants underwent randomization at 12 
Canadian multiple sclerosis clinics; 72 participants were assigned to the 
minocycline group and 70 to the placebo group. The mean age of the participants 
was 35.8 years, and 68.3% were women. The unadjusted risk of conversion to 
multiple sclerosis within 6 months after randomization was 61.0% in the placebo 
group and 33.4% in the minocycline group, a difference of 27.6 percentage points 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 11.4 to 43.9; P=0.001). After adjustment for the 
number of enhancing lesions at baseline, the difference in the risk of 
conversion to multiple sclerosis within 6 months after randomization was 18.5 
percentage points (95% CI, 3.7 to 33.3; P=0.01); the unadjusted risk difference 
was not significant at the 24-month secondary outcome time point (P=0.06). All 
secondary MRI outcomes favored minocycline over placebo at 6 months but not at 
24 months. Trial withdrawals and adverse events of rash, dizziness, and dental 
discoloration were more frequent among participants who received minocycline 
than among those who received placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of conversion from a clinically isolated syndrome to 
multiple sclerosis was significantly lower with minocycline than with placebo 
over 6 months but not over 24 months. (Funded by the Multiple Sclerosis Society

THE INFLUENCE OF HOST DEMOGRAPHY ON THE EVOLUTION OF VIRULENCE OF A 
MICROSPORIDIAN GUT PARASITE.

It is predicted that host exploitation should evolve to maximize parasite 
fitness and that virulence (= parasite-induced host mortality) evolves along 
with the rate of host exploitation. If the life expectancy of a parasite is 
short, it is expected to evolve a higher rate of host exploitation and therefore 
higher virulence because the penalty to the parasite for killing the host is 
reduced. We tested this hypothesis by keeping for 14 months the horizontally 
transmitted microsporidian parasite Glugoides intestinalis in mono-clonal host 
cultures (Daphnia magna) under conditions of high and low host background 
mortality. High host mortality, and thus parasite mortality, was achieved by 
replacing weekly 70-80% of all hosts in a culture with uninfected hosts from 
stock cultures (Replacement lines). In the low-mortality treatment no 
replacement took place. Contrary to our expectation, parasites from the 
Replacement lines evolved a lower within-host growth rate and virulence than 
parasites from the Nonreplacement lines. Across lines we found a strong positive 
correlation between within-host growth rate and virulence. We did further 
experiments to answer the question why our data did not support the predictions. 
Sporophorous vesicles (SVs, spore clusters) were smaller in doubly infected than 
in singly infected host-gut cells, indicating that competition within cells 
bears costs for the parasite. Due to our experimental protocol, the average life 
span of infections had been much higher in the Nonreplacement lines. Since the 
number of parasites inside a host increases with the time since infection, 
long-lasting infections led to high frequencies of multiply infected host-gut 
cells. Therefore, we speculated that within-cell competition was more severe in 
the Nonreplacement lines and may have led to selection for accelerated 
within-host growth. SVs in the Nonreplacement lines were indeed significantly 
larger. Our results point out that single-factor explanations for the evolution 
of virulence can lead to wrong predictions and that multiple infections are an 
important factor in virulence evolution.

BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic and/or postsurgical knee stiffness is one of the 
orthopedic complications which is difficult to be treated and can affect 
individual's life negatively. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
results of quadricepsplasty in patients with knee stiffness resulted from 
femoral fracture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study on all patients with 
femoral fracture which has caused knee flexion limitation referred to Kashani 
and Al-Zahra Hospitals in Isfahan from January 2010 to March 2013. The type and 
site of fracture, joint extension, and fracture fixation technique were 
recorded. Moreover, the range of motion (ROM) before surgery, under general 
anesthesia, and 3- and 6-month postoperation were measured.
RESULTS: Among the patients, 13 had a simple fracture (48%) and 14 had a 
segmental fracture (51.9%). Considering the fracture site, 11, 10, and 6 
patients had femoral (40.74%), supracondylar (37.3%), and femoral supracondylar 
(22.2%) fractures, respectively. The fracture fixation was performed by the 
plate, external, and Wagner fixation techniques for 24 (88.9%), 2 (7.4%), and 1 
(3.7%) patients, respectively. The mean ROM before operation, under general 
anesthesia, and 3- and 6-month postoperation were determined to be 33.15° ± 
24.73°, 122.60° ± 10.22°, 99.63° ± 16.52°, and 100.74° ± 15.67°, respectively. 
The mean ROM value at various stages was not similar (P < 0.001). The mean 
changes in the ROM were 79.2° ± 24.6° and 62.1° ± 19.7° in the cases with simple 
and segmental fractures, respectively. The mean changes in the knee ROM were 
significantly higher in simple fractures in comparison with the segmental 
femoral fracture (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: We found Thompson's quadricepsplasty may successfully increase the 
range of knee flexion in knee fracture and also regardless of quadriceps time.

BACKGROUND: Because of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, 
the patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) manifest increased ventricular 
stress, with impaired left ventricular function, and a slowing down in systemic 
venous drainage. More importantly, a reduction of the patient's life expectancy 
has been proven in the case of RAAS overstimulation. For these reasons, huge 
efforts have been made to obtain molecules able to efficaciously antagonize the 
RAAS overstimulation, such as aldosterone receptor antagonists (ARAs). These 
drugs have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart 
failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF), but not in 
those with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). In order to 
study this topic more deeply, we carried out a meta-analysis of selective and 
nonselective ARAs in HFREF and HFpEF.
METHODS: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were incorporated in our 
meta-analysis. Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: 
experimental groups included patients with CHF treated with ARAs in addition to 
the conventional therapy; control groups included patients with CHF receiving 
conventional therapy without ARAs. Outcomes of interest were all-cause 
mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, hyperkalemia, or gynecomastia.
RESULTS: Overall, 15 RCTs including a total of 15,671 patients were eligible for 
inclusion in the meta-analysis. ARA use in patients with heart failure was 
associated with a significant reduction in adverse outcomes. Indeed, a 
significant reduced odds of all-cause death among CHF patients treated with ARAs 
compared to controls was found [odds ratio (OR) =0.79; 95% CI: 0.73-0.87]. 
Subgroup analysis based on the heart failure (HF) type revealed a statistically 
significant benefit as regards all- cause death for patients with HFREF (OR 
=0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.84), but not for those with HFpEF 
(OR =0.91; 95% CI: 0.76-1.1). Furthermore reduced odds of CV hospitalizations 
was detected in the entire group of CHF patients under treatment with ARAs (OR 
=0.73; 95% CI: 0.61-0.89) as well as among HFREF patients treated with ARAs, 
compared to controls (OR =0.66; 95% CI: 0.51-0.85). Hyperkalemia was 
significantly more frequent with ARA use. Besides, ARA use was shown to be 
associated with the occurrence of gynecomastia. In particular, selective ARAs 
didn't induce significant amounts of gynecomastia compared to controls (OR 
=0.74; 95% CI: 0.43-1.27), while nonselective ARAs did (OR =8.22; 95% CI: 
4.9-13.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this meta-analysis, ARAs should be systematically used in 
patients with HFREF, in whom these drugs proved to reduce all-cause mortality 
and hospitalizations from cardiac cause. Conversely, ARA usage in HFpEF patients 
is questionable since in this CHF setting no significant improvement in clinical 
endpoints has been demonstrated so far. New selective ARAs are devoid of the 
risk of gynecomastia, while are similar to nonselective ARAs with regard to the 
efficacy profile as well as to the risk of eliciting hyperkalemia.

Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) has become the method of choice for visualizing 
the small bowel mucosa and is generally considered to be a safe method. Although 
uncommon, the most feared complication of VCE is capsule retention that can 
potentially lead to life-threatening bowel obstruction. Herein, we present for 
the first time a case of capsule retention in a colonic stent. The patient had 
known Crohn's disease with colonic involvement and underwent an uneventful but 
incomplete small bowel VCE for assessment of disease activity and extension for 
optimizing medical treatment. Five months later, the patient presented with 
intestinal obstruction due to a Crohn's-stricture in the sigmoid colon, which 
was successfully decompressed with a self-expandable metal stent. Nonetheless, 
two days later the patient showed signs of bowel obstruction again and abdominal 
X-ray showed that the capsule was trapped in the metal stent in the sigmoid 
colon. Subsequently, emergency surgery was performed and the patient fully 
recovered. Intestinal capsule retention necessitating interventional removal is 
rare. This report describes a unique case of capsule retention in a colonic 
metal stent and highlights the potential risk of performing capsule endoscopy 
examinations in patients with gastrointestinal stents.

Female competition on the spawning grounds can generate strong natural selection 
on female coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). We examined the morphology and 
investment into egg production of 13 wild and five hatchery populations. For 
each population, the degrees of breeding competition and migration arduousness 
were quantified. The results support the importance of breeding competition in 
the evolution of female morphology and life history. Female secondary sexual 
characters, including body coloration and length of kype (an extension of the 
upper jaw used for fighting), increase significantly with degree of breeding 
competition among populations. In contrast, egg size and female investment into 
egg production tend to decrease as competition increases, probably as a result 
of life-history trade-offs. The difficulty of migration to the spawning grounds 
also molds female morphology and life history. Salmon become more streamlined 
with increasing migration arduousness, and the biomass of eggs produced appears 
to decline. In hatcheries, where breeding competition is relaxed, characters 
associated with breeding competition and spawning performance are reduced. In 
contrast, egg size is increased. These results indicate that the morphology and 
life history of adult female salmon respond evolutionarily to local selection 
pressures, including both the biotic demands of breeding competition and the 
abiotic demands of migration.

Researchers have in recent years sought to establish whether the general public 
value treatment at the end of life (EOL) more highly than other treatments. 
Results are mixed, with social preferences most often exhibiting lack of 
preferences for EOL treatments. This null result may be driven by the often 
applied study design, where respondents are to choose between treatments 
targeting patients with varying fixed life expectancies. When remaining life is 
certain and salient, a rule-of-rescue sentiment may drive preferences across all 
scenarios. This study presents a different design, where the comparator is a 
preventive intervention. We study preferences from both an individual and social 
perspective and find no preference for an EOL premium.

The Medical Dangers of Literary Genius.

Ruston S.

This essay examines three key texts by William Buchan, Isaac D'Israeli, and 
Richard Robert Madden, which demonstrate the emergence of the newly conceived 
idea of literary genius in the Romantic period. It considers the role of a new 
genre, the "medical biography," in the development of this phenomenon. While the 
mental precariousness of the Romantic genius has been much commented upon, this 
essay concentrates instead on the bodily or physical aspects of genius, which is 
itself figured as a disease. The study and writing involved in publication are 
viewed as stimulants that can be addictive, ruining the health and wellbeing of 
authors and even leading to their early deaths.

As life expectancy increases so people often develop a range of conditions and 
disabilities in the years before death. Multimorbidity represents the most 
common 'disease pattern' found among the elderly and is characterised by complex 
interactions of co-existing diseases where a medical approach focused on a 
single disease does not suffice. People with dementia who also have other 
comorbidities do not always have their comorbid conditions managed as those 
without dementia which often lead to a high number of hospital admissions with 
longer lengths of stay and greater treatment costs. This case study presents the 
case management approach taken by Admiral Nursing in managing the complexities 
where there is comorbidity of a long-term condition and a diagnosis of dementia. 
By empowering the person and their carer with information and choices and 
through good case management and communication, people can be supported to live 
well and avoid inappropriate hospital admissions.

Increased life expectancy in the United States has been accompanied by a 
concomitant increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions in persons of all 
ages, especially older Americans. This necessitates new ways of organizing and 
conducting medical practice, and this affects the roles and interactions of 
health professionals. Physicians and other health professionals require 
appropriate training and more efficient workplaces to enhance their functioning 
and reduce burnout. Additional factors influencing the success of health 
professionals in further advancing the health and well-being of Americans are 
health information technology and ensuring that all have access to care.

Grade II gliomas are slowly growing primary brain tumors that affect mostly 
young patients. Cytotoxic therapies (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) are used 
initially only for patients having a bad prognosis. These therapies are planned 
following the "maximum dose in minimum time" principle, i. e. the same schedule 
used for high-grade brain tumors in spite of their very different behavior. 
These tumors transform after a variable time into high-grade gliomas, which 
significantly decreases the patient's life expectancy. In this paper we study 
mathematical models describing the growth of grade II gliomas in response to 
radiotherapy. We find that protracted metronomic fractionations, i.e. 
therapeutical schedules enlarging the time interval between low-dose 
radiotherapy fractions, may lead to a better tumor control without an increase 
in toxicity. Other non-standard fractionations such as protracted or 
hypoprotracted schemes may also be beneficial. The potential survival 
improvement depends on the tumor's proliferation rate and can be even of the 
order of years. A conservative metronomic scheme, still being a suboptimal 
treatment, delays the time to malignant progression by at least one year when 
compared to the standard scheme.

Population dynamics of the critically endangered toad Atelopus cruciger and the 
fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

Harlequin toads (Atelopus) are among the most severely impacted amphibians by 
the emergence of chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease caused by the pathogen 
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Many species disappeared while others 
suffered drastic contractions of their geographic distribution to lower 
altitudes. A diminished virulence of Bd in warm habitats was proposed to explain 
the survival of lowland populations of harlequin toads (i.e. thermal refuge 
hypothesis). To understand the mechanisms that allow some populations to reach 
an endemic equilibrium with this pathogen, we estimated demographic and 
epidemiological parameters at one remnant population of Atelopus cruciger in 
Venezuela using mark-recapture data from 2007-2013. We demonstrated that Bd is 
highly virulent for A. cruciger, increasing the odds of dying of infected adults 
four times in relation to uninfected ones and reducing the life expectancy of 
reproductive toads to a few weeks. Despite an estimated annual loss of 18% of 
the reproductive population due to Bd-induced mortality, this population has 
persisted in an endemic equilibrium for the last decade through the large 
recruitment of healthy adults every year. Given the high vulnerability of 
harlequin toads to Bd in lowland populations, thermal refuges need to be 
redefined as habitats of reduced transmission rather than attenuated virulence.

STUDY DESIGN: Quasi-Experimental.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the activation of semispinalis cervicis (d-SSC) and 
splenius capitis (s-SC) muscles, and the activation between the two during neck 
pulley and free weight exercises.
BACKGROUND: Altered activation of cervical extensors may occur with neck pain, 
suggesting that exercises should be designed to target these muscles.
METHODS: d-SSC and s-SC activity was recorded unilaterally with intramuscular 
electromyography from healthy volunteers during cervical isometric exercises: 1) 
extension with a pulley rope angled from incline to vertical, 2) extension with 
right, left and central forehead hanging weight, and 3) rotation with pulley 
rope angled from incline to decline.
RESULTS: Extension against a vertical force led to greater activation of d-SSC 
(P < 0.001) and s-SC (P < 0.001) compared to the inclined, declined and 
horizontal pulley. With each of these conditions, amplitude of muscle activity 
was higher for the d-SSC compared to the s-SC muscle (P < 0.0001). Extension 
with free weight hanging on right, left or central forehead, showed no 
differences across conditions, although in each condition, the d-SSC amplitude 
was higher than the s-SC. For cervical rotation, the declined pulley led to the 
greatest activation of both muscles (P < 0.05). Higher levels of activity were 
observed for the s-SC compared to the d-SSC (P < 0.01) for all rotation 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: A vertical resistance during an extension exercise or a declined 
resistance during cervical rotation, increased neck extensor activation. The 
results from this preliminary study provide guidance for future work on the 
exploration and development of low-load exercise design for patients with neck 
pain disorders.

AIM: We compared changes in tobacco consumption and diet in relation to changes 
in life expectancy in 1988-1998 in 22 OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development) countries.
METHOD: Between 1985 and 1995 using regression analysis we estimated differences 
in tobacco consumption per adult and the differences in the sum of atherogenic 
and thrombogenic indices against life expectancy. Each index was derived from 
the various fats per gram of food from standard texts, and from the annual 
measurements of fat in the food balance sheets of each country.
RESULTS: In 1985-1995, New Zealand showed the largest decrease in tobacco 
consumption per adult (41%) and the greatest decrease (except for Switzerland) 
in the sum of atherogenic and thrombogenic indices (17%) as a measure of diet. 
New Zealand ranked first for life expectancy increases from 1988-1998 for men 
(3.2 years), women (2.8 years) and both sexes combined. Regression analyses 
revealed that increases in life expectancy across the OECD for males, but not 
females, were strongly associated with decreases in tobacco consumption, with a 
weaker effect of diet improvement.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that reduced tobacco consumption in 1985-1995 
likely contributed to New Zealand's gains in life expectancy from 1988-1998.

INTRODUCTION: Fractures of the Intertrochanteric (IT) region are some of the 
most common fractures encountered by an orthopedic surgeon in his lifetime. With 
increase in life expectancy, the incidence of these fractures is also 
increasing. By 2040, the incidence of these fractures is expected to double. 
Unstable IT fractures are a major cause of concern in the elderly due to the 
associated increase in morbidity and mortality.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to compare the intraoperative and 
postoperative parameters using the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS), the Cemented Bipolar 
Hemiarthroplasty (BH) and the Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN) for the management of 
unstable IT fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients, having unstable IT fractures with age 
more than 60 years were randomly selected and were followed up averagely for 19 
months (12- 30 months). The type of implant for a particular patient and a 
particular type of fracture was randomly selected and the same surgical team 
treated all patients. Total number of 19 patients were operated using the DHS 
(Group-1), 13 using the BH (Group-2) and 18 using the PFN (Group-3). All 
patients in the three groups were compared in terms of preoperative, 
intraoperative and postoperative parameters and functionally assessed using the 
Harris hip score and the mobility score of Parker and Palmer.
RESULTS: Patients operated using the PFN had significantly lower mean blood loss 
as compared to the other two groups. The mean days to unaided Full Weight 
Bearing (FWB) was significantly higher in patients treated by the DHS as 
compared to the other two groups. All three groups were comparable in terms of 
functional assessment.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of unstable IT fracture of femur is a matter open to 
debate. IT fractures of elderly must be treated with considering the age of the 
patient, mental status, bone quality, and the type of fracture. Level of 
Evidence according to OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group - Level 2.

The thermodynamic stability of biomolecules in the perspective of evolution is a 
complex issue and needs discussion. Intra molecular bonds maintain the structure 
and the state of internal energy (E) of a biomolecule at "local minima". In this 
communication, possibility of loss in internal energy level of a biomolecule 
through the changes in the bonds has been discussed, that might earn more 
thermodynamic stability for the molecule. In the process variations in structure 
and functions of the molecule could occur. Thus, E of a biomolecule is likely to 
have energy stature for minimization. Such change in energy status is an 
intrinsic factor for evolving biomolecules buying more stability and generating 
variations in the structure and function of DNA molecules undergoing natural 
selection. Thus, the variations might very well contribute towards the process 
of evolution. A brief discussion on conserved sequence in the light of 
proposition in this communication has been made at the end. Extension of the 
idea may resolve certain standing problems in evolution, such as maintenance of 
conserved sequences in genome of diverse species, pre- versus post adaptive 
mutations, 'orthogenesis', etc.

Epilepsy forecasting has been extensively studied using high-order time series 
obtained from scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG). An accurate seizure 
prediction system would not only help significantly improve patients' quality of 
life, but would also facilitate new therapeutic strategies to manage epilepsy. 
This paper thus proposes an improved Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm to mine 
seizure forecasts from neural activity by modeling three properties in the 
high-order EEG time series: noise, temporal smoothness, and tensor structure. 
The proposed High-Order Kalman Filter (HOKF) is an extension of the standard 
Kalman filter, for which higher-order modeling is limited. The efficient dynamic 
of HOKF system preserves the tensor structure of the observations and latent 
states. As such, the proposed method offers two main advantages: (i) 
effectiveness with HOKF results in hidden variables that capture major evolving 
trends suitable to predict neural activity, even in the presence of missing 
values; and (ii) scalability in that the wall clock time of the HOKF is linear 
with respect to the number of time-slices of the sequence. The HOKF algorithm is 
examined in terms of its effectiveness and scalability by conducting forecasting 
and scalability experiments with a real epilepsy EEG dataset. The results of the 
simulation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the original 
Kalman Filter and other existing methods.

There are distinct subgroups of patients who have historically been 
underrepresented in most prospective clinical trials in breast cancer, including 
the youngest and oldest patients, male patients, and those struggling with 
obesity. Herein, we review current and future directions in research for each of 
these special populations with breast cancer, highlighting significant knowledge 
gaps and priorities in tumor biology and heterogeneity, therapeutic decision 
making promotion of adherence, supportive care, and psychosocial and functional 
well-being. In younger women, future study should focus on the biological 
underpinnings of aggressive disease and optimizing adherence and treatment 
decision making while addressing their unique survivorship needs. The latter 
includes generating a scientific basis for interruption of therapy for 
pregnancy. Among older patients, interventions should focus on increasing 
clinical trial accrual, predicting and mitigating toxicity so that functional 
status can be optimized, tailoring needs for dose modification, and anticipating 
life expectancy in the context of competing causes of death. For men with breast 
cancer, we need worldwide collaboration to answer even basic questions on 
optimal treatment, supportive care, and survivorship strategies. Finally, for 
those struggling with obesity, we need to better understand the biological 
associations with cancer incidence, prognosis and outcome, and how we can best 
intervene to assure weight loss at the "right time." It is only through highly 
collaborative, far-reaching, prospective, multidisciplinary, patient-centered, 
and patient-engaged efforts that we can optimize the physical and psychologic 
outcomes for all patients with breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); 2647-54.

BACKGROUND: Muscular strength is associated with functional ability in elderly, 
and older adults are recommended to perform muscle-strengthening exercise. 
Understanding how improved muscle strength and -mass influence general and 
specific domains of quality of life is important when planning health promotion 
efforts targeting older adults. The aims of the present study were to describe 
changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older men participating in 
12 weeks of systematic strength training, and to investigate whether 
improvements in muscle strength and muscle mass are associated with enhancements 
in HRQOL.
METHODS: We recruited 49 men aged 60-81 years to participate in an intervention 
study with pre-post assessment. The participants completed a 12-week strength 
training program consisting of three sessions per week. Tests and measurements 
aimed at assessing change in HRQOL, and changes in physical performance (maximal 
strength) and physiological characteristics. HRQOL was measured using the 
12-item short-form survey (SF-12). Muscle mass was assessed based on changes in 
lean mass (leg, trunk, arm, and total), and strength was measured as 
one-repetition maximum in leg extension, leg press, and biceps curl.
RESULTS: Two of the eight HRQOL SF-12 scores, role physical and general health, 
and the physical component summary scores, increased significantly during the 
intervention period. Small significant positive correlations were identified 
between improvements in muscle strength, and better physical and social 
function. Moreover, a significant increase in total muscle mass was seen during 
the intervention period.
CONCLUSIONS: The positive, findings from this study would suggest that 
systematic strength training seems to be a beneficial intervention to improve 
HRQOL, muscle strength and muscle mass in older men.

Minors and euthanasia: a systematic review of argument-based ethics literature.

University of Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 35, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.

Euthanasia was first legalised in the Netherlands in 2002, followed by similar 
legislation in Belgium the same year. Since the beginning, however, only the 
Netherlands included the possibility for minors older than 12 years to request 
euthanasia. In 2014, the Belgian Act legalising euthanasia was amended to 
include requests by minors who possess the capacity of discernment. This 
amendment sparked great debate, and raised difficult ethical questions about 
when and how a minor can be deemed competent. We conducted a systematic review 
of argument-based literature on euthanasia in minors. The search process 
followed PRISMA guidelines. Thirteen publications were included. The 
four-principle approach of medical ethics was used to organise the ethical 
arguments underlying this debate. The justification for allowing euthanasia in 
minors is buttressed mostly by the principles of beneficence and respect for 
autonomy. Somewhat paradoxically, both principles are also used in the 
literature to argue against the extension of legislation to minors. Opponents of 
euthanasia generally rely on the principle of non-maleficence.
CONCLUSION: The present analysis reveals that the debate surrounding euthanasia 
in minors is at an early stage. In order to allow a more in-depth ethical 
discussion, we suggest enriching the four-principle approach by including a 
care-ethics approach. What is Known: • The Netherlands and Belgium are the only 
two countries in the world with euthanasia legislation making it possible for 
minors to receive euthanasia. • This legislation provoked great debate globally, 
with ethical arguments for and against this legislation. What is New: • A 
systematic description of the ethical concepts and arguments grounding the 
debate on euthanasia in minors, as reported in the argument-based ethics 
literature. • A need has been identified to enrich the debate with a care-ethics 
approach to avoid oversimplifying the ethical decision-making process.

AIM: To assess the impact of faster aspart vs insulin aspart on long-term 
clinical outcomes and costs for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in 
the UK setting.
METHODS: The QuintilesIMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical 
outcomes and costs over patient lifetimes in a cohort with data on baseline 
characteristics from the "onset 1" trial. Treatment effects were taken from the 
26-week main phase of the onset 1 trial, with costs and utilities based on 
literature review. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% 
annually.
RESULTS: Projections indicated that faster aspart was associated with improved 
discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (by 0.13 quality-adjusted 
life-years) vs insulin aspart. Improved clinical outcomes resulted from fewer 
diabetes-related complications and a delayed time to their onset with faster 
aspart. Faster aspart was found to be associated with reduced costs vs insulin 
aspart (cost savings of £1715), resulting from diabetes-related complications 
avoided and reduced treatment costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Faster aspart was associated with improved clinical outcomes and 
cost savings vs insulin aspart for patients with T1DM in the UK setting.

Many bacteria have toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, where toxin gene expression 
inhibits their own cell growth. mRNA is one of the well-known targets of the 
toxins in the type II toxin-antitoxin systems. Here, we examined the ribosome 
dependency of the endoribonuclease activity of YhaV, one of the toxins in type 
II TA systems, on mRNA in vitro and in vivo. A polysome profiling assay revealed 
that YhaV is bound to the 70S ribosomes and 50S ribosomal subunits. Moreover, we 
found that while YhaV cleaves ompF and lpp mRNAs in a translation-dependent 
manner, they did not cleave the 5' untranslated region in primer extension 
experiments. From these results, we conclude that YhaV is a ribosome-dependent 
toxin that cleaves mRNA in a translation-dependent manner.

OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to identify factors that contribute to the 
formation of acute spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) by correlating etiology, age, 
site, clinical status, and treatment with immediate results and long-term 
outcomes. METHODS The authors reviewed their series of 15 patients who had been 
treated for SEH between 1996 and 2012. In addition, the authors reviewed the 
relevant international literature from 1869 (when SEH was first described) to 
2012, collecting a total of 1010 cases. Statistical analysis was performed in 
959 (95%) cases that were considered valid for assessing the incidence of age, 
sex, site, and clinical status at admission, correlating each of these 
parameters with the treatment results. Statistical analysis was also performed 
in 720 (71.3%) cases to study the incidence of etiological factors that favor 
SEH formation: coagulopathy, trauma, spinal puncture, pregnancy, and 
multifactorial disorders. The clinical status at admission and long-term outcome 
were studied for each group. Clinical status was assessed using the Neuro-Grade 
(NG) scale. RESULTS The mean patient age was 47.97 years (range 0-91 years), and 
a significant proportion of patients were male (60%, p < 0.001). A bimodal 
distribution has been reported for age at onset with peaks in the 2nd and 6th 
decades of life. The cause of the SEH was not reported in 42% of cases. The 
etiology concerned mainly iatrogenic factors (18%), such as coagulopathy or 
spinal puncture, rather than noniatrogenic factors (29%), such as genetic or 
metabolic coagulopathy, trauma, and pregnancy. The etiology was multifactorial 
in 11.1% of cases. The most common sites for SEH were C-6 (n = 293, 31%) and 
T-12 (n = 208, 22%), with maximum extension of 6 vertebral bodies in 720 cases 
(75%). At admission, 806 (84%) cases had moderate neurological impairment (NG 2
