BACKGROUND: The relationship between gastric fluid volume, volume of fluid 
regurgitated, and aspirated fluid volume remains unclear. Using a life-like 
manikin suitable for a pulmonary aspiration model, we aimed to assess the 
relationship between regurgitated and aspirated clear fluid volumes, and to 
determine the minimal value of the volume of liquid regurgitated that may lead 
to pulmonary aspiration of fluid volume ≥ 0.8 mL kg-1 (around 60 mL) that is 
likely to cause lung injury.
METHODS: Several volumes of water ranging from 30 to 150 mL were injected in 
a randomized order, at a flow rate of 20 mL per second, into the esophagus of 
a manikin lying in the supine position on a non-tilted table, with the manikin 
head in the extension or in the sniffing position. Aspirated volumes were 
measured in the manikin bronchi, by an investigator blinded to the volume 
injected. Aspiration was defined as positive when the volume of collected water 
was ≥ 60 mL for at least one of the five injections of each volume of water.
RESULTS: The minimal volume of water injected into the esophagus for an 
aspirated volume ≥ 0.8 mL kg-1 was 85 mL in the sniffing position, and was 150 
mL in the extension position.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the critical cut-off value of gastric 
fluid volume to be considered for the risk of significant pulmonary aspiration 
would be ≥ 85 mL (≥ 1 mL kg-1), in the sniffing position. These results should 
however be confirmed in further studies using other models.

IMPORTANCE: Information on the economic burden of cancer mortality can serve as 
a tool in setting policies and prioritizing resources for cancer prevention and 
control. However, contemporary data are lacking for the United States nationally 
and by state.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate lost earnings due to death from cancer overall and for 
the major cancers in the United States nationally and by state.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Person-years of life lost (PYLL) were 
calculated using numbers of cancer deaths and life expectancy data in 
individuals aged 16 to 84 years who died from cancer in the United States in 
2015. The annual median earnings in the United States were used to assign a 
monetary value for each PYLL by age and sex. Cancer mortality and life 
expectancy data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics and 
annual median earnings from the US Census Bureau's 2016 Current Population 
Survey's March Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Data analysis was 
performed from October 22, 2018, to February 25, 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lost earnings due to cancer death, represented as 
estimated future wages in the absence of premature death.
RESULTS: A total of 8 739 939 person-years of life were lost to cancer death in 
persons aged 16 to 84 years in the United States in 2015, translating to lost 
earnings of $94.4 billion (95% CI, $91.7 billion-$97.3 billion). For individual 
cancer sites, lost earnings were highest for lung cancer ($21.3 billion), 
followed by colorectal ($9.4 billion), female breast ($6.2 billion), and 
pancreatic ($6.1 billion) cancer. Age-standardized lost earning rates per 
100 000 were lowest in the West and highest in the South, ranging from $19.6 
million (95% CI, $19.1 million-$20.2 million) in Utah to $35.3 million ($34.4 
million-$36.3 million) in Kentucky. Approximately 2.4 million PYLL and $27.7 
billion (95% CI, $26.9 billion-$28.5 billion) in lost earnings (29.3% of total 
that occurred in 2015) would have been avoided in 2015 if all states had the 
same age-specific PYLL or lost earning rates as Utah.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings indicate large state variation in the 
economic burden of cancer and suggest the potential for substantial financial 
benefit through delivery of effective cancer prevention, screening, and 
treatment to minimize premature cancer mortality in all states.

We systematically reviewed the evidence on secular trends in main chronic 
conditions, disability and self-assessed general health among adults in the 
United Kingdom, as reported in primary/secondary care databases and 
population-based surveys. Searches were conducted separately for: (1) trends in 
age-standardised or age-specific prevalence of major non-communicable diseases, 
disability, and self-reported general health; (2) trends in health expectancy. 
The databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE/EMBASE Classic and Web of Science 
(all from 1946/7). The evidence was synthesised narratively. There were 39 
studies reporting trends in prevalence of health conditions and 15 studies in 
health expectancy. We did not find evidence for improvement in the 
age-standardised or age-specific prevalence of any of the studied major chronic 
conditions over the last few decades, apart from Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias. Both increasing or stable prevalence rates with simultaneous rising 
life expectancy support the expansion of morbidity theory, meaning that people 
are expected to spend a greater number of years with chronic condition(s). The 
evidence on disability-expressed as prevalence or health expectancy-was mixed, 
but also appeared to support the expansion of morbidity among those aged 65 or 
over. The evidence on trends in disability for younger age is lacking. Across 
the studied period (1946-2017), the UK population endured more years with 
chronic morbidity and disability, which may place a serious strain on the health 
care system, the economy and the society.

The analysis of health policy trajectories contributes to disclose the 
endogenous and exogenous elements that influence the management of health 
systems. This article aims to describe the trajectory of the Unified Health 
System of the Federal District (SUS-DF) from 1960 to 2018 and identify the 
challenges to expand the capacity for protection and health promotion of the 
population of the Federal District. A documentary analysis of plans, reports, 
and articles published from 1959 to 2018 and the collection of secondary data 
were carried out in databases of DATASUS and the Government of the Federal 
District. RESULTS The SUS-DF trajectory was delineated through care organization 
actions, health system management and health care personnel training and 
development. Health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy at 
birth have shown a positive development. There was an increase in health care 
servicesupply, with an increase in the number of beds, basic health units and 
professionals, although insufficient, given the population increase. CONCLUSION 
the actions indicate the growing complexity of health system management, with 
challenges related to the adaptation of the capacity to respond to the 
population'shealth needs and reveal internal potentials in the field of health 
training.

The effect of pre-corrosion pits on residual fatigue life for the 42CrMo steel 
(American grade: AISI 4140) is investigated using the accelerated pre-corrosion 
specimen in the saline environment. Different pre-corroded times are used for 
the specimens, and fatigue tests with different loads are then carried out on 
specimens. The pre-corrosion fatigue life is studied, and the fatigue fracture 
surfaces are examined by a surface profiler and a scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) to identify the crack nucleation sites and to determine the size and 
geometry of corrosion pits. Moreover, the stress intensity factor varying with 
corrosion pits in different size parameters is analyzed based on finite element 
(FE) software ABAQUS to derive the regression formula of the stress intensity 
factor. Subsequently, by integrating the regression formula with the Paris 
formula, the residual fatigue life is predicted and compared with experimental 
results, and the relationship of the stress intensity factor, pit depth, and 
residual fatigue life are given under different corrosion degrees. The fatigue 
life predicted by the coupled formula agrees well with experiment results. It is 
observed from the SEM images that higher stress amplitude and longer 
pre-corroded time can significantly decrease the residual fatigue life of the 
steel. Additionally, the research work has brought about the discovery that the 
rate of crack extension accelerates when the crack length increases. The 
research in this paper also demonstrates that the corrosion pit size can be used 
as a damage index to assess the residual fatigue life.

BACKGROUND: With increasing demand for red meat in Tanzania comes heightened 
potential for zoonotic infections in animals and humans that disproportionately 
affect poor communities. A range of frontline government employees work to 
protect public health, providing services for people engaged in animal-based 
livelihoods (livestock owners and butchers), and enforcing meat safety and food 
premises standards. In contrast to literature which emphasises the inadequacy of 
extension support and food safety policy implementation in low- and 
middle-income countries, this paper foregrounds the 'street-level diplomacy' 
deployed by frontline actors operating in challenging contexts.
METHODS: This research is based on semi-structured interviews with 61 government 
employees, including livestock extension officers/meat inspectors and health 
officers, across 10 randomly-selected rural and urban wards.
RESULTS: Frontline actors combined formal and informal strategies including the 
leveraging of formal policy texts and relationships with other state employees, 
remaining flexible and recognising that poverty constrained people's ability to 
comply with health regulations. They emphasised the need to work with livestock 
keepers and butchers to build their knowledge to self-regulate and to work 
collaboratively to ensure meat safety. Remaining adaptive and being hesitant to 
act punitively unless absolutely necessary cultivated trust and positive 
relations, making those engaged in animal-based livelihoods more open to 
learning from and cooperating with extension officers and inspectors. This may 
result in higher levels of meat safety than might be the case if frontline 
actors stringently enforced regulations.
CONCLUSION: The current tendency to view frontline actors' partial enforcement 
of meat safety regulations as a failure obscures the creative and proactive ways 
in which they seek to ensure meat safety in a context of limited resources. 
Their application of 'street-level diplomacy' enables them to be sensitive to 
local socio-economic realities, to respect local social norms and expectations 
and to build support for health safety interventions when necessary. More 
explicitly acknowledging the role of trust and positive state-society relations 
and the diplomatic skills deployed by frontline actors as a formal part of their 
inspection duties offers new perspectives and enhanced understandings on the 
complicated nature of their work and what might be done to support them.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Steps 
Towards Alcohol Misuse Prevention Programme (STAMPP) compared with education as 
normal (EAN) in reducing self-reported heavy episodic drinking (HED) in 
adolescents.
DESIGN: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis from a public sector perspective 
conducted as part of a cluster randomised trial.
SETTING: This study was conducted in 105 high schools in Northern Ireland and in 
Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: Students in school year 8/S1 (aged 11-12) at baseline were 
included in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: This is a classroom-based alcohol education curricula, combined 
with a brief alcohol intervention for parents/carers.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome of this study is the cost per young person 
experiencing HED avoided due to STAMPP at 33 months from baseline.
RESULTS: The total cost of STAMPP was £85 900, equivalent to £818 per school and 
£15 per pupil. Due to very low uptake of the parental component, we calculated 
costs of £692 per school and £13 per pupil without this element. Costs per pupil 
were reduced further to £426 per school and £8 per pupil when it was assumed 
there were no additional costs of classroom delivery if STAMPP was delivered as 
part of activities such as personal, social, health and economic education. 
STAMPP was associated with a significantly greater proportion of pupils 
experiencing a heavy drinking episode avoided (0.08/8%) and slightly lower 
public sector costs (mean difference -£17.19). At a notional willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £15 (reflecting the cost of STAMPP), the probability of STAMPP 
being cost-effective was 56%. This level of uncertainty reflected the 
substantial variability in the cost differences between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: STAMPP was relatively low cost and reduced HED. STAMPP was not 
associated with any clear public sector cost savings, but neither did it 
increase them or lead to any cost-shifting within the public sector categories. 
Further research is required to establish if the cost-effectiveness of STAMPP is 
sustained in the long term.

BACKGROUND Desmoid tumors are fibrous neoplasms that originate from the 
musculoaponeurotic structures in the body. Abdominal wall desmoid tumors are 
rare, but they can be locally aggressive, with high incidence of recurrence. 
These tumors are more common in young, fertile women. They frequently occur 
during or after pregnancy. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 63-year-old 
post-menopausal woman with a desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall. She 
had no relevant family history. During abdominoplasty, an incidental mass was 
excised and biopsied, and was identified as a desmoid tumor with free margins. 
One year later, the patient presented with vague abdominal discomfort and 
feeling of heaviness. An incision was made through the previous abdominoplasty 
scar to maintain the aesthetic outcome. A large mass, arising from the abdominal 
wall and extending intra-abdominally, was excised and was determined to be a 
recurrent desmoid tumor. CONCLUSIONS Recurrent anterior abdominal wall desmoid 
tumors in post-menopausal women are rare and locally aggressive, with a high 
risk of recurrence. During abdominal wall repair in abdominoplasty, desmoid 
tumor filaments might seed deep intra-abdominally. Therefore, it is necessary to 
take adequate safe margins before abdominal wall repair. Post-operatively, 
surgeons should keep a high index of suspicion for tumor recurrence.

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological fracture 
prevention as prescribed in the five largest European countries (EU5) using the 
IOF reference cost-effectiveness model. Pharmacological fracture prevention as 
prescribed in clinical practice was cost-saving (provided more QALYs at lower 
costs) compared to no treatment in each of the EU5.
PURPOSE: To estimate the real-world cost-effectiveness of pharmacological 
fracture prevention as prescribed in the five largest European countries by 
population size: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK) 
(collectively EU5).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed sales data on osteoporosis drugs in each of 
the EU5 to derive a hypothetical intervention that corresponds to the mix of 
osteoporosis medication prescribed in clinical practice. The costs for this 
treatment mix were obtained directly from the sales data, and the efficacy of 
the treatment mix was estimated by weighing the treatment-specific fracture risk 
reductions from a published meta-analysis. Subsequently, we estimated the 
cost-effectiveness using costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of the 
intervention compared to no treatment in each of the EU5 using the International 
Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) reference cost-effectiveness model. The model 
population comprised postmenopausal women, mean age 72 years with established 
osteoporosis (T-score ≤ - 2.5) among whom 23.6% had a prevalent vertebral 
fracture. The model was populated with country-specific data from the 
literature.
RESULTS: Pharmacological fracture prevention as prescribed in clinical practice 
was cost-saving (provided more QALYs at lower costs) compared to no treatment in 
each country. The findings were robust in scenario analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological fracture prevention as prescribed in clinical 
practice is cost-saving in each of the EU5. Because of the under-diagnosis and 
under-treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, from a health economic 
perspective, further cost-savings may be reached by expanding treatment to those 
at increased risk of fracture currently not receiving any treatment.

Life expectancy is rising in most parts of the world as is the prevalence of 
chronic diseases. Suboptimal adherence to long-term medications is still rather 
the norm than the exception, although it is well known that suboptimal adherence 
compromises the therapeutic effectiveness. Information and communications 
technology provides new concepts for improving adherence to medications. These 
so-called telehealth concepts or services help to implement closed-loop 
healthcare paradigms and to establish collaborative care networks involving all 
stakeholders relevant to optimising the overall medication therapy. Together 
with data from Electronic Health Records and Electronic Medical Records, these 
networks pave the way to data-driven decision support systems. Recent advances 
in machine learning, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence allow 
further steps towards fully autonomous telehealth systems. This might bring 
advances in the future: disburden healthcare professionals from repetitive 
tasks, enable them to timely react to critical situations, and offer a 
comprehensive overview of the patients' medication status. Advanced analytics 
can help to assess whether patients have taken their medications as prescribed, 
to improve adherence via automatic reminders. Ultimately, all relevant data 
sources need to be collated into a basis for data-driven methods, with the goal 
to assist healthcare professionals in guiding patients to obtain the best 
possible health status, with a reasonable resource utilisation and a 
risk-adjusted safety and privacy approach. This paper summarises the 
state-of-the-art of telehealth and artificial intelligence applications in 
medication management. It focuses on 3 major aspects: latest technologies, 
current applications, and patient related issues.

BACKGROUND: Contemporary data on loss in life expectancy after aortic valve 
replacement (AVR) are scarce, particularly in younger patients.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this national, observational cohort study was to 
analyze long-term relative survival and estimated loss in life expectancy after 
AVR.
METHODS: The study included 23,528 patients who underwent primary surgical AVR 
with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in Sweden between 
1995 and 2013 from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and 
Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to 
Recommended Therapies) register. Individual level linking with other national 
health-data registers was performed to obtain baseline characteristics and vital 
status. The expected survival from the general Swedish population matched by 
age, sex, and year of surgery was obtained from the Human Mortality Database. 
The relative survival was used as an estimate of cause-specific mortality. 
Flexible parametric models based on relative survival were used to estimate the 
loss in life expectancy.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 6.8 years. The 19-year observed, expected, and 
relative survival was 21%, 34%, and 63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 59% to 
67%), respectively. The loss in life expectancy was 1.9 years (95% CI: 1.2 to 
2.6 years) in the total study population. The estimated loss in life expectancy 
increased with younger age: 0.4 years (95% CI: 0.3 to 0.5 years) versus 4.4 
years (95% CI: 1.5 to 7.2 years) in patients ≥80 and <50 years of age, 
respectively. There was no difference in loss in life expectancy between men and 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found a shorter life expectancy in patients after AVR 
compared with the general population. The estimated loss in life expectancy was 
substantial, and increased with younger age. These results provide important 
information to quantify disease burden after AVR, and are relevant for 
clinicians counseling patients before and after AVR. (HeAlth-data Register

BACKGROUND: This analysis compared quality-adjusted time without symptoms of 
disease progression or toxicity (Q-TWiST) between nivolumab and everolimus among 
previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma enrolled in the 
phase III CheckMate 025 trial (NCT01668784).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At 45-month follow-up, overall survival (OS) was 
partitioned into 3 health states: TWiST, time with grade ≥ 3 toxicity (TOX), and 
time after progression (REL). Mean Q-TWiST was determined by multiplying each 
state's duration with its utility (TWiST, 1.0; TOX, 0.5; REL, 0.5). Relative 
Q-TWiST gains (calculated as Q-TWiST difference divided by everolimus OS) of ≥ 
10% were predefined as clinically important. Immuno-oncology-specific 
sensitivity analyses considered 4 alternative progression definitions: Tumor 
size increase ≥ 25% from nadir; treatment discontinuation; ≥ 2-point reduction 
from baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index 
Disease-Related Symptoms scores; and a composite definition. A scenario 
incorporating grade ≥ 2 toxicities was tested.
RESULTS: Compared with everolimus, nivolumab was associated with a significant 
Q-TWiST improvement of 3.3 months (P < .001). In all sensitivity analyses, 
nivolumab was associated with Q-TWiST gains (relative gain %) ranging from 3.3 
months (14.4%) to 4.8 months (20.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is associated with a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful gain in quality-adjusted OS versus everolimus among 
previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: The current status, time trends and future projections of a national 
health equity target are crucial elements of national health equity 
surveillance. This study examined time trends in inequality by income in life 
expectancy (LE) at birth between 2004 and 2017 and made future projections for 
the year 2030 in Korea.
DESIGN: Using individually linked mortality data, time trends in inequality by 
income in LE at birth were examined. The LE projection was made with the 
Lee-Carter model.
SETTING: Total Korean population and death data derived from the National Health 
Information Database of the National Health Insurance Service.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 685 773 157 subjects and 3 486 893 deaths between 2004 
and 2017 were analysed.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual LE and the magnitude of 
inequality by income in LE between 2004 and 2030.
RESULTS: Inequality by income in LE among the total Korean population increased 
during the past 14 years, and this inequality is projected to become even 
greater in the future. In 2030, the magnitude of inequality by income in LE is 
projected to increase by 0.25 years in comparison to the magnitude in 2017. The 
increase in LE inequality was projected to be more prominent among women, with a 
projected 1.08 year increase in LE inequality between 2017 and 2030.
CONCLUSION: Aggressive policies should be developed to close the increasing LE 
gap in Korea. LE inequalities by income should be considered as a measurable 
target for health equity in the process of establishing the National Health Plan 
2030 in Korea.

BACKGROUND: Several randomized control trials (RCTs) have showed that adding 
either abiraterone acetate (AA) or docetaxel (D) to androgen-deprivation therapy 
(ADT) improves survival of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer 
patients (mCSPC). Yet, the cost-effectiveness of these treatment options has not 
been fully compared under Hong Kong's setting. This cost-effectiveness analysis 
(CEA) serves as the first study in Hong Kong to compare the economic value of 
these two combinations ADT + AA vs. ADT + D.
METHODS: A deterministic Markov model is used to project cost-effectiveness of 
each treatment until death. Survival curves for progression/death were extracted 
and digitized from the five RCTs (CHAARTED, LATITUDE, two STAMPEDE (2016/2017), 
and GETUG-AFU15). Clinically significant adverse events (AEs) were modeled; 
utility values were obtained from the literature. Primary outcomes were the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). We used the societal perspective from Hong Kong and considered three 
times of local gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) as the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (i.e., US$138,649). We estimated the 
break-even cost of AA in case ADT + AA is not a cost-effective strategy under 
this WTP threshold. While considering the standard AA dosage (1000 mg) as the 
main analysis, we also examined the potential impact of the low-dose AA (250 mg) 
strategy.
RESULTS: Integrating simulations with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
ADT + D returns 0.79 (median; 95% credible interval 0.56-0.97) QALY with an ICER 
of US$14,397/QALY ($7824-22,632) compared to ADT-alone. A head-to-head 
comparison indicates that ADT + AA further gains 0.79 (0.45-1.17) QALY but with 
an ICER of $361,439/QALY ($260,615-599,683) when compared to ADT + D. 
Considering three times of GDPpc as WTP threshold, ADT + D is more 
cost-effective in all simulations; while ADT + AA is more cost-effective than 
ADT + D only if the cost of AA is reduced by at least 63%. The low-dose AA 
(250 mg) strategy is potentially cost-effective when it generates equivalent 
efficacy as the standard dosage (1000 mg).
CONCLUSIONS: ADT + D is therefore shown to be a more cost-effective strategy 
than ADT + AA in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients in 
developed economies. Addition of AA substantially improved QALY compared to D 
but at a significant cost.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate county-level adult life expectancy for Whites, 
Black/African Americans (Black), American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) and 
Asian/Pacific Islander (Asian) populations and assess the difference across 
racial groups in the relationship among life expectancy, rurality and specific 
race proportion.
METHODS: We used individual-level death data to estimate county-level life 
expectancy at age 25 (e25) for Whites, Black, AIAN and Asian in the contiguous 
USA for 2000-2005. Race-sex-stratified models were used to examine the 
associations among e25, rurality and specific race proportion, adjusted for 
socioeconomic variables.
RESULTS: Lower e25 was found in the central USA for AIANs and in the west coast 
for Asians. We found higher e25 in the most rural areas for Whites but in the 
most urban areas for AIAN and Asians. The associations between specific race 
proportion and e25 were positive or null for Whites but were negative for 
Blacks, AIAN, and Asians. The relationship between specific race proportion and 
e25 varied across rurality.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying differences in adult life expectancy, both across and 
within racial groups, provides new insights into the geographic determinants of 
life expectancy disparities.

The calendar year fallacy: The danger of reliance on calendar year data in 
end-of-life capacity and financial planning.

Jones RP(1).

Author information:
(1)Population Health Analytics Department, Healthcare Analysis & Forecasting, 
Leominster, UK.

Planners, actuaries, and others involved in forecasting capacity and costs must 
manipulate historical data. Data from calendar/financial year totals have been 
assumed to be adequate and reliable. This relies on the assumption that 
year-to-year differences do not arise from patterns concealed in the data. While 
the seasonal cycle is widely recognized, longer term patterns such as disease 
outbreaks will act to modify annual demand and costs. Monthly data relating to 
deaths in local government areas in England and Wales are used to demonstrate 
curious semipermanent bursts of high behavior. There is no seasonal pattern for 
the start of these events, and the sudden switch to high deaths can occur at any 
time, even in immediately adjacent areas. Higher deaths and related demand and 
costs endure for around 12 months before they suddenly revert to the former 
level where they stay until the next of these curious high events. In England 
and Wales (and many other countries), a period of unexplained higher deaths, 
reduced life expectancy, and health care and life insurance costs since 2011 
appears to be coming to an end and looks to have arisen from a coincidence of 
these events at sub-national level.

Metal Ions in Alzheimer's Disease: A Key Role or Not?

Despite tremendous research efforts in universities and pharmaceutical 
companies, effective drugs are still lacking for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The biochemical mechanisms of this devastating neurodegenerative 
disease have not yet been clearly understood. Besides a small percentage of 
cases with early onset disease having a genetic origin (<5%, familial AD), most 
cases develop in the elderly as a sporadic form due to multiple and complex 
parameters of aging. Consequently, AD is spreading in all countries with a long 
life expectancy. AD is characterized by deposition of senile plaques made of 
β-amyloid proteins (Aβ) and by hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which have 
been considered as the main drug targets up to now. However, antibodies 
targeting amyloid aggregates, as well as enzyme inhibitors aiming to modify the 
amyloid precursor protein processing, have failed to improve cognition in 
clinical trials. Thus, to set up effective drugs, it is urgent to enlarge the 
panel of drug targets. Evidence of the link between AD and redox metal 
dysregulation has also been supported by post-mortem analyses of amyloid 
plaques, which revealed accumulation of copper, iron, and zinc by 5.7, 2.8, and 
3.1 times, respectively, the levels observed in normal brains. Copper-amyloid 
complexes, in the presence of endogenous reductants, are able to catalyze the 
reduction of dioxygen and to produce reduced, reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
leading to neuron death. The possibility of using metal chelators to regenerate 
normal trafficking of metal ions has been considered as a promising strategy in 
order to reduce the redox stress lethal for neurons. However, most attempts to 
use metal chelators as therapeutic agents have been limited to existing 
molecules available from the shelves. Very few chelators have resulted from a 
rational design aiming to create drugs with a safety profile and able to cross 
the blood-brain barrier after an oral administration. In the human body, metals 
are handled by a sophisticated protein network to strictly control their 
transport and reactivity. Abnormal concentrations of certain metals may lead to 
pathological events due to misaccumulation and irregular reactivity. 
Consequently, therapeutic attempts to restore metal homeostasis should carefully 
take into account the coordination chemistry specificities of the concerned 
redox-active metal ions. This Account is focused on the role of the main 
biologically redox-active transition metals, iron and copper. For iron, the 
recent debate on the possible role of magnetite in AD pathogenesis is presented. 
The section devoted to copper is focused on the design of specific copper 
chelators as drug candidates able to regulate copper homeostasis and to reduce 
the oxidative damage responsible for the neuron death observed in AD brains. A 
short survey on non-redox-active metal ions is also included at the beginning, 
such as aluminum and its controversial role in AD and zinc which is a key metal 
ion in the brain.

A relatively short storage life is considered a major problem for the 
transportation of strawberries across long distances to markets and for 
exportation. The aim of this research is to study the combined effects of 
potassium sorbate and radiation (3 kGy) on the microbial load, shelf life and 
most of the biochemical constituents such as vitamin C and total soluble solids 
of strawberries. A potassium sorbate (1%) treatment was combined, in practical 
application, with irradiation (3 kGy) to extend the shelf life of strawberries. 
All strawberry samples were stored at 4 ± 1 °C (90-92% RH). Quality assessment 
of the microbial and biochemical constituents, vitamin C, and TSS during the 
storage period was performed. The results showed that Gamma irradiation alone at 
3 kGy extended the shelf life of strawberries to 21 days. Further extension of 
the shelf life to 21 days was obtained when irradiation (3 kGy) was combined 
with potassium sorbate treatment. All treatments caused non-significant 
decreases in vitamin C content during storage, except for the treatment of 
strawberries with a solution of potassium sorbate, which caused a significant 
decrease in the vitamin C content, and a gradual decrease in the vitamin C 
content occurred with an increase in storage time for all treatments.
