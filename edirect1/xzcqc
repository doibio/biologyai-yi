Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for mortality and morbidity, 
as well as a growing public health problem. Several studies describe the 
epidemiology of CKD (i.e. prevalence, incidence) by examining short time 
intervals. Conversely, the trend of epidemiology over time has not been well 
investigated, although it may provide useful information on how to improve 
prevention measures and the allocation of economic resources. Our aim here is to 
describe the main aspects of the epidemiology of CKD by focusing on its temporal 
variation. The global incidence of CKD has increased by 89% in the last 27 
years, primarily due to the improved socio-demographic index and 
life-expectancy. Prevalence has similarly increased by 87% over the same period. 
Mortality rate has however decreased over the last decades, both in the general 
and CKD populations, due to a reduction in cardiovascular and infectious disease 
mortality. It is important to emphasize that the upward trend of incidence and 
prevalence of CKD can be explained by the ageing of the population, as well as 
by the increase in the prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension, 
diabetes and obesity. It seems hard to compare trends between Italy and other 
countries because of the different methods used to assess epidemiologic 
measures. The creation of specific CKD Registries in Italy appears therefore 
necessary to monitor the trend of CKD and its comorbidities over time.

BACKGROUND: Increased coverage with antiretroviral therapy for people living 
with HIV in low- and middle-income countries has increased their life expectancy 
associated with non-HIV comorbidities and the need for quality-assured and 
affordable non-communicable diseases drugs . Funders are leaving many 
middle-income countries that will have to pay and provide quality-assured and 
affordable HIV and non-HIV drugs, including for non-communicable diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate costs for originator and generic antiretroviral therapy 
as the number of people living with HIV are projected to increase between 2016 
and 2026, and discuss country, regional and global factors associated with 
increased access to generic drugs.
METHODS: Based on estimates of annual demand and prices, annual cost estimates 
were produced for generic and originator antiretroviral drug prices in low- and 
middle-income countries and projected for 2016-2026.
RESULTS: Drug costs varied between US$1.5 billion and US$4.8 billion for generic 
drugs and US$ 8.2 billion and US$16.5 billion for originator drugs between 2016 
and 2026.
DISCUSSION: The global HIV response increased access to affordable generic drugs 
in low- and middle-income countries. Cheaper active pharmaceutical ingredients 
and market competition were responsible for reduced drug costs. The development 
and implementation of regulatory changes at country, regional and global levels, 
covering intellectual property rights and public health, and flexibilities in 
patent laws enabled prices to be reduced. These changes have not yet been 
applied in many low- and middle-income countries for HIV, nor for other 
infectious and non-communicable diseases, that lack the profile and political 
attention of HIV. Licensing backed up with Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights safeguards should become the norm to provide quality-assured and 
affordable drugs within competitive generic markets.
CONCLUSION: Does the political will exist among policymakers and other 
stakeholders to develop and implement these country, regional and global 
frameworks for non-HIV drugs as they did for antiretroviral drugs?

Adaptive learning systems have received an increasing attention as they enable 
to provide personalized instructions tailored to the behaviors and needs of 
individual learners. In order to reach this goal, it is desired to have an 
assessment system, monitoring each learner's ability change in real time. The 
Elo Rating System (ERS), a popular scoring algorithm for paired competitions, 
has recently been considered as a fast and flexible method that can assess 
learning progress in online learning environments. However, it has been argued 
that a standard ERS may be problematic due to the multidimensional nature of the 
abilities embedded in learning materials. In order to handle this issue, we 
propose a system that incorporates a multidimensional item response theory model 
(MIRT) in the ERS. The basic idea is that instead of updating a single ability 
parameter from the Rasch model, our method allows a simultaneous update of 
multiple ability parameters based on a compensatory MIRT model, resulting in a 
multidimensional extension of the ERS ("M-ERS"). To evaluate the approach, three 
simulation studies were conducted. Results suggest that the ERS that incorrectly 
assumes unidimensionality has a seriously lower prediction accuracy compared to 
the M-ERS. Accounting for both speed and accuracy in M-ERS is shown to perform 
better than using accuracy data only. An application further illustrates the 
method using real-life data from a popular educational platform for exercising 
math skills.

BACKGROUND: In India, proportion of elderly is increasing with decrease in 
mortality rate and increase in life expectancy. There is a paucity of studies on 
elder abuse, a problem faced frequently by an elderly. The present study planned 
to find out the prevalence of abuse and associated risk factors among community 
dwelling elderly in an urban resettlement colony of east Delhi.
METHODS: It is a community-based cross-sectional study. This study was done 
among elderly residents aged 60 years and above in an urban resettlement colony 
of east Delhi. Study participants were interviewed using a pretested, 
semi-structured questionnaire. Data were collected regarding sociodemographic 
profile and prevalence of abuse. Simple descriptive tables were generated to 
denote frequencies. Cross-tabulation and chi-square test were applied to study 
the association between various sociodemographic characteristics and elder 
abuse.
RESULTS: A total of 125 elderly were interviewed. Twelve (9.6%) reported 
experience of abuse. All abused participants faced neglect, four faced verbal 
abuse, and two participants reported physical and one financial abuse. Abused 
elderly belonged to a higher age group >70 years and did not have regular 
contact with family and friends (P = 0.00; no involvement in social activities 
(P = 0.001). Abuse was more likely when "finances were managed by others" (P = 
0.02) and having dependency for daily needs (P = 0.00).
CONCLUSION: Elder abuse is prevalent in India. The victims of abuse lack social 
support and network and are reluctant to report abuse.

BACKGROUND: Decisions for operative or nonoperative management remain 
challenging for patients with spinal metastases, especially when life expectancy 
and quality of life are not easily predicted. This study evaluated the effects 
of operative and nonoperative management on maintenance of ambulatory function 
and survival for patients treated for spinal metastases.
METHODS: Propensity matching was used to yield an analytic sample in which 
operatively and nonoperatively treated patients were similar with respect to key 
baseline covariates. The study included patients treated for spinal metastases 
between 2005 and 2017 who were 40 to 80 years old, were independent ambulators 
at presentation, and had fewer than 5 medical comorbidities. It evaluated the 
influence of operative care and nonoperative care on ambulatory function 
6 months after presentation as the primary outcome. Survival at 6 months and 
survival at 1 year were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-nine individuals eligible for inclusion were 
identified, with 402 (201 operative patients and 201 nonoperative patients) 
retained after propensity score matching. Patients treated operatively had a 
lower likelihood than those treated nonoperatively of being nonambulatory 
6 months after presentation (3% vs 16%; relative risk [RR], 0.16; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.06-0.46) as well as a reduced risk of 6-month mortality (20% vs 
29%; RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in a group of patients with similar 
demographic and clinical characteristics, those treated operatively were less 
likely to lose ambulatory function 6 months after presentation than those 
managed nonoperatively. For patients with spinal metastases, our data can be 
incorporated into discussions about the treatments that align best with 
patients' preferences regarding surgical risk, mortality, and ambulatory status.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who have 
sustained an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB), the benefits and harms of oral 
anticoagulation change over time. Early resumption of anticoagulation increases 
recurrent bleeding, while delayed resumption exposes patients to a higher risk 
of ischemic stroke. We therefore set out to estimate the expected benefit of 
resuming anticoagulation as a function of time after UGIB among patients with 
NVAF.
METHODS: We created a decision-analytic model estimating discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years when patients with NVAF resume anticoagulation on 
each day following UGIB. We simulated from a health system perspective over a 
lifelong time horizon.
RESULTS: Peak utility for warfarin was achieved by resumption 41 days after 
hemostasis from the index UGIB. Resumption between days 32 and 51 produced 
greater than 99.9% of the peak utility. Peak utility for apixaban was achieved 
by resumption 32 days after the index UGIB. Resumption between days 21 and 47 
produced greater than 99.9% of the peak utility. Of input parameters, results 
were most sensitive to underlying stroke risk. Specifically, across the range of 
CHA2DS2-Vasc scores, the optimal day of resumption varied by around 11 days for 
patients resuming warfarin and by around 15 days for patients resuming apixaban. 
Results were less sensitive to underlying risk of rebleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with NVAF following UGIB, warfarin is optimally 
restarted approximately six weeks following hemostasis, and apixaban is 
optimally restarted approximately one month following hemostasis. Modest changes 
to this timing based on probability of thromboembolic stroke are reasonable.

BACKGROUND: There is little information on stroke morbidity in Kenya to inform 
health care planning. The disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are a 
time-based measure of health status that incorporates both disability and 
mortality.
METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective study in Kenya's public tertiary 
hospitals conducted in 2015-2017. Data on sex, age, and global disability 
outcome were collected and used to calculate the sum of years of life lost 
prematurely due to stroke (YLL), the years of healthy life lost due to 
disability (YLD), and the DALYs.
RESULTS: Up to 719 adult stroke patients participated in the study. The peak age 
group for stroke was 60-64 years, with ischemic stroke accounting for 56.1% of 
the stroke cases. After 1-year follow-up, the YLD were 2,402.50, YLL were 
5,335.99, and the DALYs were 7,738.49. YLD contributed 31% of the total DALYs. 
The DALYs varied by sex (male: 2,835.79; female: 4,902.70 years) and by stroke 
type (ischemic stroke: 4,652.98; hemorrhagic stroke: 3,085.51). The young age 
group (< 45 years) bore a greater burden accounting for 35.6% of the total 
DALYs.
CONCLUSION: The YLD, YLL, and DALYs observed reinforce the need for targeted 
prevention of risk factors and comprehensive stroke care initiatives in Kenya.

In this work, a method is presented which allows the determination of 
calorimetric information, and thus, information about the precipitation and 
dissolution behavior of aluminum alloys during heating rates that could not be 
previously measured. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is an established 
method for in-situ recording of dissolution and precipitation reactions in 
various aluminum alloys. Diverse types of DSC devices are suitable for different 
ranges of scanning rates. A combination of the various available commercial 
devices enables heating and cooling rates from 10-4 to 5 Ks-1 to be covered. 
However, in some manufacturing steps of aluminum alloys, heating rates up to 
several 100 Ks-1 are important. Currently, conventional DSC cannot achieve these 
high heating rates and they are still too slow for the chip-sensor based fast 
scanning calorimetry. In order to fill the gap, an indirect measurement method 
has been developed, which allows the determination of qualitative information, 
regarding the precipitation state, at various points of any heat treatment. 
Different rapid heat treatments were carried out on samples of an alloy EN 
AW-6082 in a quenching dilatometer and terminated at defined temperatures. 
Subsequent reheating of the samples in the DSC enables analysis of the 
precipitation state of the heat-treated samples. This method allows for 
previously un-measurable heat treatments to get information about the occurring 
precipitation and dissolution reactions during short-term heat treatments.

Life expectancy in the West is the highest it has ever been, due to the 
introduction of better hygiene practices and sophisticated medical interventions 
for cancer, autoimmunity and infectious disease. With these modern advances, a 
rise in the prevalence of opportunistic infections has also been observed. These 
include several fungal infections, which present a particular clinical challenge 
due to the lack of fungal vaccines, limited diagnostics and increasing 
antifungal drug resistance. This mini-review outlines how modern-day clinical 
practices have shaped the recent increase in fungal diseases observed in the 
last few decades. We discuss new research that has implicated the use of 
immune-modulating drugs in the enhanced susceptibility of vulnerable patients to 
life-threatening fungal infections.

BACKGROUND: It is believed that direct odontoid screw fixation preserves the 
physiological cervical range of motion following surgery. However, there are no 
clinical studies confirming the motion sparing value of this technique. This 
study aims to (1) to assess active cervical range of motion following types II 
and III odontoid fracture, successfully treated with anterior odontoid screw 
fixation, and (2) to examine the relationship between the range of motion of the 
head and duration of collar usage, neck pain, quality of life, and patients' 
age.
METHODS: The study involved 41 patients subjected to a procedure of direct 
osteosynthesis of the dens with lag screw. Following the operation all the 
patients had to wear a cervical collar to protect the osteosynthesis. The 
control group consisted of 41 individuals with no clinical diagnosis of any 
cervical spine disorders. The spinal motion was assessed using multi-cervical 
unit, taking into account bending/extension, left and right lateral flexion, and 
left and right axial rotation.
RESULTS: In the study group, spine mobility correlated with the duration of hard 
collar usage following the operation, with a longer duration corresponding to 
poorer spine mobility at the end of the treatment. Statistically significant 
correlation was observed in the case of extension (p < 0.021) and axial rotation 
(p < 0.007). In the study group, there was a negative correlation between the 
range of motion and the patients' age, i.e., the older the patient the poorer 
his/her spinal mobility (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Active cervical range of motion in patients following direct 
osteosynthesis of the dens, augmented with a hard collar, was significantly 
lower than in the control population, and it correlated negatively with the 
duration of collar usage, the patients' age, and intensity of spinal pain.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases are expected to have a growing impact 
worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the worldwide burden of MSK diseases from 2000 to 2015.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which combines the years of 
life lost (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs), were extracted for 
183 countries from the WHO Global Health Estimates Database. We analysed the 
median proportion of DALYS, YLLs and YLDs for MSK diseases (ICD-10: M00-M99) 
among the 23 WHO categories of diseases. Mixed models were built to assess 
temporal changes.
RESULTS: Worldwide, the total number of MSK DALYs increased significantly from 
80,225,634.6 in 2000 to 107,885,832.6 in 2015 (p < 0.001), with the total number 
of MSK YLDs increasing from 77,377,709.4 to 103,817,908.4 (p = 0.0008) and MSK 
diseases being the second cause of YLDs worldwide. YLLs due to MSK diseases 
increased from 2,847,925.2 to 4,067,924.2 (p = 0.03). In 2015, the median 
proportion of DALYs attributed to MSK diseases was 6.66% (IQR: 5.30 - 7.88) in 
Europe versus 4.66% (3.98 - 5.59) in the Americas (p < 0.0001 vs Europe), 4.17% 
(3.14 - 6.25) in Asia (p < 0.0001), 4.14% (2.65 - 5.57) in Oceania (p = 0.0008) 
and 1.33% (1.03 - 1.92) in Africa (p < 0.0001). We observed a significant 
correlation (r = 0.85, p < 0.0001) between the proportion of MSK DALYs and the 
gross domestic product per capita for the year 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of MSK diseases increased significantly between 2000 and 
2015 and is high in Europe. These results are crucial to health professionals 
and policy makers to implement future health plan adjustments for MSK diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, autoimmune, 
gastrointestinal disorder. Canada has one of the highest prevalence and 
incidence rates of IBD in the world. Diagnosis is challenging due to the 
similarity of symptoms to functional gastrointestinal disorders. 
Faecalcalprotectin (FC) is a biomarker for active mucosal inflammation and has 
proven effective in the diagnosis of IBD. Our study objective was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of adding an FC test compared with standard practice (blood 
test) in primary care among adult patients presenting with gastrointestinal 
symptoms.
DESIGN: We constructed a decision analytic tree with a 1-year time horizon. The 
cut-off level of 100 µg/g was used for FC testing. Probabilistic analyses were 
conducted for the base case and all scenarios.
SETTING: Canadian health sector perspective.
POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of adult patients presenting with 
gastrointestinal symptoms in the primary care setting.
INTERVENTIONS: FC test compared with blood test.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of FC test expressed as cost per QALY gained 
compared with blood test and time to IBD diagnosis.
RESULTS: FC testing is expected to cost more ($C295.1 vs $C273.9) than standard 
practice but yield little higher QALY (0.751vs0.750). The ICER of FC test was 
$C20 323 per QALY. Probabilistic analysis demonstrated that at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $C50 000 per QALY, there was 81.3% probability 
of FC test being cost-effective. The use of FC test in primary care reduced the 
time to IBD diagnosis by 40.0 days (95% CI 16.3 to 65.3 days), compared with 
blood testing alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis of short-term outcomes, screening adult 
patients in primary care using FC test at a cut-off level of 100 µg/g is 
expected to be cost-effective in Canada.

Chronic conditions as predictors of later life disability employment exit: a 
gendered analysis.

Holman D.

OBJECTIVES: Increasing life expectancy has led governments to implement reforms 
aimed at delaying retirement. Chronic conditions are an important barrier to 
this given their association with pain, functional limitations, depression and 
ultimately lower life expectancy. Chronic diseases are gendered in terms of 
these characteristics, as well as their population prevalence. I examined the 
extent to which gender moderates the extent to which different chronic 
conditions lead to disability employment exit, the proportion of exits they 
account for and key mediators in this process.
METHODS: Data from waves 1 to 8 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing were 
analysed. I followed employees aged 50-70 years until they experienced 
disability employment exit, or were censored. I analysed the influence of 
chronic conditions, functional limitations, pain, depressive symptoms and 
subjective life expectancy using discrete time survival analysis. All analyses 
were carried out separately by gender if a significant interaction was found. 
The mediation analysis was carried out using the Karlson/Holm/Breen method.
RESULTS: No significant gender interactions were found for the risk of chronic 
conditions on disability employment exit. Lung disease (OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.8 to 
5.9), cancer (OR 2.9; 95% CI 2.1 to 4.0) and arthritis (OR 2.6; 95% CI 2.1 to 
3.3) were the strongest determinants. Depressive symptoms (OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.5 to 
4.1) were also a strong determinant, and along with arthritis, explained a 
greater proportion of women than men's exits given differences in prevalence. 
Pain and various types of functional limitations were important mediators of 
exit as well as determinants in their own right.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that gender differences in the prevalence of 
different chronic conditions result in differences in the proportion of 
disability employment exits they account for in the population. Targeted and 
tailored interventions, for example, in the workplace might take this into 
account.

Mushroom cultivation has gained increased attention in recent years. Currently, 
only four types of spawn, including sawdust spawn, grain spawn, liquid spawn, 
and stick spawn, are commonly available for mushroom cultivation. This limited 
spawn diversity has led to difficulty in selecting suitable inoculum materials 
in some cultivation. In this study, three small blocks of lignocellulosic 
agro-wastes and one block of a synthetic matrix were prepared as support for 
growing Pleurotus ostreatus in liquid medium. Mycelium-adsorbed blocks were then 
evaluated for their potential as block spawn for fructification. Our results 
indicated that the edible fungus was adsorbed and abundantly grew internally and 
externally on loofah sponge and synthetic polyurethane foam (PUF) supports and 
also has the ability to attach and grow on the surface of sugarcane bagasse and 
corncob supports. The mycelia of P. ostreatus adhered on corncob exhibited the 
highest metabolic activity, while those on the PUF showed the least activity. 
Mycelial extension rates of block spawns made of agro-waste materials were 
comparable to that of sawdust spawn, but the block spawn of PUF showed a 
significantly lower rate. No significant differences in cropping time and yield 
were observed among cultivations between experimental block spawns and sawdust 
spawns. Moreover, the corncob block spawn maintained its fruiting potential 
during an examined period of 6-month storage. The developed block spawn could be 
practically applied in mushroom cultivation.

The cost of treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Spain is 
substantial. Findings from the randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3b/4 
EXTEND study showed that an extended-pulsed fidaxomicin (EPFX) regimen was 
associated with improved sustained clinical cure and reduced recurrence of CDI 
versus vancomycin in patients aged 60 years and older. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of EPFX versus vancomycin for the treatment of CDI in 
patients aged 60 years and older from the perspective of the National Health 
System (NHS) in Spain. We used a Markov model with six health states and 1-year 
time horizon. Health resources, their unit costs and utilities were based on 
published sources. Key efficacy data and transition probabilities were obtained 
from the EXTEND study and published sources. A panel of Spanish clinical experts 
validated all model assumptions. In the analysis, 0.638 and 0.594 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient were obtained with EPFX and 
vancomycin, respectively, with a gain of 0.044 QALYs with EPFX. The cost per 
patient treated with EPFX and vancomycin was estimated to be €10,046 and 
€10,693, respectively, with a saving of €647 per patient treated with EPFX. For 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of €20,000, €25,000 and €30,000 per QALY gained, 
the probability that EPFX was the most cost-effective treatment was 99.3%, 99.5% 
and 99.9%, respectively. According to our economic model and the assumptions 
based on the Spanish NHS, EPFX is cost-effective compared with vancomycin for 
the first-line treatment of CDI in patients aged 60 years and older.

Disorders: A Systematic Literature Review.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to systematically review effects of 
nutrition interventions on outcomes in patients with chronic gastrointestinal 
(GI) motility disorders. There is currently a lack of evidence-based guidelines 
for nutrition management in this group, likely a result of the rarity of the 
conditions.
METHODS: A systematic review of all study types to evaluate current 
evidence-based nutrition interventions was performed using Medline, Embase, and 
CINAHL databases. Two independent reviewers participated in the process of this 
systematic review. A total of 15 studies and a total of 524 subjects were 
included.
RESULTS: Best treatment of this population group was found to include a stepwise 
process, progressing from oral nutrition to jejunal nutrition and lastly to 
parenteral nutrition. Small particle, low-fat diets were significantly better 
tolerated than the converse, with jejunal nutrition prior to consuming oral food 
significantly improving oral intake and motility. In more progressive cases, 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension nutrition had lower 
reported symptoms than other enteral routes. Exclusive long-term parenteral 
nutrition is a feasible option for advanced cases, with a 68% survival rate at 
15 years duration, though oral intake with parenteral nutrition is associated 
with higher survival rates.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with GI motility disorders should first trial 
oral nutrition. For patients who progress to jejunal or parenteral feeds, the 
primary aim should be to maintain or reinstate oral intake to reduce morbidity 
and mortality risk. Higher-quality studies are still required in this area, 
particularly in the areas of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and systemic 
sclerosis.

The review describes the current understanding of endothelial dysfunction, 
methods of its evaluation, and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of 
various techniques. The role of nitric oxide and endothelin as important markers 
of endothelial dysfunction is shown, and the methods of their determination in 
clinical practice are described. The authors conclude that in order to improve 
the life expectancy and quality of life of patients with cardiovascular 
diseases, reduce the risk and frequency of complications and mortality rates, it 
is necessary to study the function of endothelium in more detail and to look for 
ways of drug correction, taking into account the pathogenetic mechanisms of its 
formation.

CONTEXT: Powerful demographic trends toward reproductive aging of human 
populations, older age at first childbirth, and lower birth rates will 
profoundly influence the health, vitality, and economies of human societies and 
deserve greater attention in health policy and research.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Information on birth rates, fertility rates, and outcomes 
of assisted reproductive technologies were obtained from databases of government 
agencies (census data, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fecundity declines with advancing age, especially in women 
>35 years and men >50 years. Advanced parental age adversely affects pregnancy 
outcomes for the mother and the offspring and increases the offspring's risk of 
chromosomal disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and birth defects. Because of 
increased life expectancy, today people will spend a major portion of life in a 
period of reproductive senescence; diseases associated with reproductive 
senescence will influence the health and well-being of middle-aged and older 
adults. Inversion of the population age pyramid will affect health care costs, 
retirement age, generational distribution of wealth, and the vitality of 
societies. Actions can be taken to mitigate the societal consequences of these 
trends. An educational campaign to inform young people about the trade-offs 
associated with postponement of childbirth will enable them to make informed 
choices. Some repositioning of research agenda and health care policies is 
needed to address the public health threat posed by reproductive aging.
CONCLUSION: The consequences of low fertility rates and delayed parenthood on 
our nation's health, vitality, and economic growth should be considered when 
crafting research, health, and economic policies.

Uninsured patients lacking access to primary and preventive care continues to be 
an issue. The purpose of this analysis is to describe operating costs 
surrounding a nurse-driven freestanding community clinic and to calculate 
quality of life benefits using clinically preventable burden scores. A 
retrospective records review of patients (n = 200) receiving care at a free 
clinic were used. Annual costs were $387,252. The benefit gained in 
quality-adjusted life years is estimated to be 57.47-203.94 yielding a return on 
investment ranging from $1,200,264-$8,948,184. Free clinics have sustained cost 
savings over time. Policies addressing this form of care are imperative.

Pathogenic hemizygous variants in the SH2D1A gene cause X-linked 
lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome, a rare primary immunodeficiency usually 
associated with fatal Epstein-Barr virus infection. Disease onset is typically 
in early childhood, and the average life expectancy of affected males is ∼11 
years. We describe clinical, radiographic, neuropathologic, and genetic features 
of a 49-year-old man presenting with central nervous system vasculitis that was 
reminiscent of adult primary angiitis but which was unresponsive to treatment. 
The patient had 2 brothers; 1 died of aplastic anemia at age 13 and another died 
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in his sixties. Exome sequencing of the patient 
and his older brother identified a novel hemizygous variant in SH2D1A (c.35G>T, 
p.Ser12Ile), which encodes the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule 
(SLAM)-associated protein (SAP). Molecular modeling and functional analysis 
showed that this variant had decreased protein stability, similar to other 
pathogenic missense variants in SH2D1A. The family described in this report 
highlights the broadly heterogeneous clinical presentations of XLP and the 
accompanying diagnostic challenges in individuals presenting in adulthood. In 
addition, this report raises the possibility of a biphasic distribution of XLP 
cases, some of which may be mistaken for age-related malignancies and autoimmune 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Medicaid recipients with serious mental illness die 25-30 years 
earlier than people in the general population due to health conditions that are 
modifiable through lifestyle changes. Cardiovascular diseases from excess 
weight, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle contribute substantially to this life 
expectancy disparity. The current study evaluated the impact of incentives on 
participation in weight management programming (for overweight and obese adults) 
and smoking cessation treatment (for regular smokers).
METHODS: Participants were Medicaid recipients with disabling mental illness 
receiving services at any one of 10 community mental health centers across New 
Hampshire. Using an equipoise stratified randomized design, n = 1348 were
