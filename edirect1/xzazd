maker's confidence in making a reimbursement decision. On discussions with the 
decision maker we now intend to incorporate the use of VOI into our HTA process.

ST-segment elevation in Greece: a cost-utility analysis.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend treatment with antiplatelet and 
anticoagulant therapy for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events 
among patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or 
unstable angina (UA). The CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent 
Recurrent Events) trial has shown that clopidogrel alone or in combination with 
aspirin is more effective in reducing the risk of atherothrombotic events than 
aspirin alone in NSTEMI or UA patients. However, in the current climate of 
financial constraints, the effectiveness of a treatment should be considered in 
conjunction with its long-term economic costs to determine the best possible 
care.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of 1 year of treatment with 
clopidogrel in addition to aspirin in NSTEMI or UA patients from the 
third-party-payer perspective in Greece.
METHODS: An existing Markov model consisting of six states (NSTEMI/UA/no event, 
first year with stroke, history of stroke, first year with myocardial infarction 
[MI], history of MI and death) was adapted and extended to the Greek healthcare 
setting for year 2012. Utility values obtained from a Greek national study were 
assigned to each health state in order to estimate the quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Costs assigned to each health state included antiplatelet 
treatment cost, cost for the management of adverse events and the costs for 
concomitant medication, hospitalization, outpatient visits, rehabilitation and 
nursing. Cost effectiveness and cost utility was expressed as the cost per 
life-year (LY) gained and QALY gained, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: The Markov analysis predicts a discounted survival of 8.27 years in the 
aspirin treatment group and 8.41 years in the aspirin plus clopidogrel treatment 
group. The corresponding discounted QALYs were 6.88 and 7.00, respectively. The 
cumulated lifetime costs per patient were € 18 779 and € 19 191, for the aspirin 
and aspirin plus clopidogrel treatment arms, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with the addition of clopidogrel was &U20AC;2951 
for each LY saved and &U20AC;3541 for each QALY saved. Finally, clopidogrel plus 
aspirin was found to be cost effective in more than 95% of simulated samples at 
a threshold of &U20AC;7000 per discounted QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: One-year treatment with clopidogrel in addition to aspirin is a 
cost-effective treatment option for secondary prevention in patients with acute 
coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation in Greece.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of bacterial meningitis risk lifelong sequelae. In 
economic evaluations of vaccines protecting against meningitis, treatment and 
productivity costs due to meningitis sequelae are rarely included in studies 
from low-income countries, mainly due to lack of data. The aim of this study was 
to estimate the costs of meningitis sequelae in children in Senegal from the 
perspective of households.
METHODS: Children who had suffered from bacterial meningitis were identified 
from a database at Albert Royer Hospital in Dakar. Sixty-eight children were 
located at their home and caregivers interviewed about costs during the acute 
meningitis episode and due to meningitis sequelae, including productivity loss 
from caring for a disabled child. Lifetime costs were predicted by assuming a 
life expectancy of 30 years for disabled children.
RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the children had either minor or major sequelae. 
Mean discounted lifetime sequelae costs amounted to US$ 34,895 (95% confidence 
interval: US$ 67-96,755) per child. Discounted childcare costs amounted to US$ 
3158 (9%), treatment costs US$ 460 (1%) and productivity costs US$ 31,276 (90%). 
No children were receiving rehabilitation services by the time the study was 
conducted.
CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to present data on household costs 
from families with disabled children in a low-income country setting. Caring for 
a disabled child is a considerable financial as well as emotional burden for the 
individual family. None of the families could afford the treatment they desired 
for their child.

BACKGROUND: Since the advent of antiretrovirals, HIV disease has largely come to 
be considered a chronic disease for those able to access treatment. As such, the 
concept of 'living well' with HIV is important. Increasing evidence suggests a 
high symptom burden in HIV that persists in the presence of treatment.
OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to measure the prevalence and burden of pain and 
other physical and psychological symptoms among South African HIV-positive 
patients attending highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) clinics.
METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional survey. Simple random sampling 
was used to recruit 385 adult participants.
RESULTS: The sample had a median age of 40 years (Q1 - Q3=33 - 46) and 98.4% 
were on HAART. The mean latest CD4 count for the participants was 
355.06±219/mm³. The mean number of symptoms of the 32 symptoms on the MSAS-SF 
experienced by participants was 10.24±5.71 (range 1 - 28). All 4 psychological 
symptoms were in the top 10 most prevalent symptoms, with feeling sad being the 
most prevalent symptom overall.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of symptoms and the high symptom burden 
experienced by the participants in this survey suggest inadequate symptom 
control and highlight the palliative care needs of an ambulant patient 
population already on HAART. Extension of life without reasonable efforts to 
also address the patient's quality of life is not ethically justifiable. In 
addition, more research appears to be required to answer whether these findings 
are associated with sub-optimal HAART adherence.

AIM:The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether favorable short-term 
results in term of functional outcome and survival following lung volume 
reduction surgery persist for longer periods. Composite preoperative and early 
postoperative variables were analysed. METHODS: This study was conducted on 52 
emphysematous patients who underwent lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) from 
1993 to 2000, through a delayed retrospective analysis that has allowed us to 
evaluate a long-term follow-up (10 years or more); lung function and other 
variables were considered with respect to survival; 11 patients submitted to 
lung transplantation were also evaluated. RESULTS:Upper lobe distribution of 
emphysema (P=0.02, HR:2.43) and systolic PAP (P=0.04, HR=2.11) were 
significantly correlated to survival in a multivariate analysis; these variables 
seem to identify a small subgroup of 14 patients with longer survival (more than 
10 years). Lung transplantation performed in some worsening patients (mean 
FEV1%:17±4) showed a trend of better survival when we compared the observed 
survival (55±47 months) with expected survival (39.5±15 months) (P=ns). 
CONCLUSION: We conclude that LVRS can lead to a very long survival (10 years or 
more) in a small subgroup of patients, with improvement of pulmonary functional 
data. Some preoperative data (upper lobe distribution of emphysema and pulmonary 
arterial pressure) appear to predict survival. Lung transplantation can be 
offered to these patients, showing a trend to improved life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Modern treatment of pediatric cancer patients has improved 
survival and life expectancy. However, treatment is associated with significant 
side-effects, including hearing loss. Hearing impairment has an important impact 
on language, communication and social skills, as well as on academic performance 
in school.
AIMS: 1. Characterize hearing loss caused by treatment of pediatric cancer. 2. 
Define the impact of hearing loss on language development. 3. Describe 
techniques for intervention.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of ten children averaging five 
years of age who were referred to MICHA, a center specializing in treating 
hearing impaired children. For each child, at least four hearing tests were 
obtained, various language acquisition tests administered and methods of 
interventions recorded.
RESULTS: All the subjects had high-tone symmetric sensorineural hearing loss; at 
4000 Hz it reached 80 dB HL. Low frequency tones were better preserved. 
Pure-tone thresholds were worse than speech reception thresholds. Hearing aids 
improved hearing thresholds. Nine out of the ten children experienced a delay in 
language acquisition. The treatment plan included: hearing aids, hearing 
training, intervention in language and communication skills, emotional support 
and preparation for elementary school.
CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss amongst pediatric cancer patients as a consequence of 
treatment is extremely common. Delays in acquisition of language skills are seen 
in the majority of these children.
DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY: Pediatric cancer patients should be referred to a proper 
diagnostic and intervention program. They are likely to benefit from monitoring 
the hearing before, during and after treatment, and from interventions to 
improve their hearing, language and communication skills. In addition, 
audiometry and otoacoustic emissions should be used to identify early damage to 
the inner ear. Noise and further exposure to ototoxic medications should be 
avoided.

& Medicaid Services, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850, USA. liming.cai@cms.hhs.gov

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost of an additional disability-free life year for 
older Americans in 1992-2005.
DATA SOURCE: This study used 1992-2005 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, a 
longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries with a rotating panel design.
STUDY DESIGN: This analysis used multistate life table model to estimate 
probabilities of transition among a discrete set of health states (nondisabled, 
disabled, and dead) for two panels of older Americans in 1992 and 2002. Health 
spending incurred between annual health interviews was estimated by a 
generalized linear mixed model. Health status, including death, was simulated 
for each member of the panel using these transition probabilities; the 
associated health spending was cross-walked to the simulated health changes.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) increased 
significantly more than life expectancy during the study period. Assuming that 
50 percent of the gains in DFLE between 1992 and 2005 were attributable to 
increases in spending, the average discounted cost per additional 
disability-free life year was $71,000. There were small differences between 
gender and racial/ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost of an additional disability-free life year was 
substantially below previous estimates based on mortality trends alone.

The cost-effectiveness of falls prevention interventions for older 
community-dwelling Australians.

(1)Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, University of 
Technology, New South Wales.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies designed to prevent 
falls among older people.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model of interventions designed to prevent 
falls was developed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using quality 
adjusted life year (QALYs) as the measure, were calculated for those 
interventions aimed at the general population (home exercise, group exercise, 
tai chi, multiple and multi-factorial interventions); high-risk populations 
(group exercise, home hazard assessment/modification and multi-factorial 
interventions); and specific populations (cardiac pacing, expedited cataract 
surgery and psychotropic medication withdrawal). Uncertainty was explored using 
univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: In the general population, compared with no intervention the ICERs 
were tai chi ($44,205), group-based exercise ($70,834), multiple interventions 
($72,306), home exercise ($93,432), multifactorial interventions with only 
referral ($125,868) and multifactorial interventions with an active component 
($165,841). The interventions were ranked by cost in order to exclude dominated 
interventions (more costly, less effective) and extendedly dominated 
interventions (where an intervention is more costly and less effective than a 
combination of two other interventions). Tai chi remained the only 
cost-effective intervention for the general population.
IMPLICATIONS: Interventions designed to prevent falls in older adults living in 
the community can be cost-effective. However, there is uncertainty around some 
of the model parameters which require further investigation.

Quality of life assessments in advanced breast cancer: should there be more 
consistency?

Quality of life (QOL) measures have assumed increasing importance in assessing 
the impact of therapeutic drugs and interventions on patients and in making 
judgements about their cost-effectiveness. Important treatment decisions and 
crucial funding strategies involve QOL data and, for patients with a disease 
such as advanced breast cancer that impinges on their life expectancy, QOL can 
become a hugely important consideration. Yet, despite this, there is a lack of 
consensus on what defines an appropriate QOL measure, and inconsistency in the 
instruments that are chosen to measure it. The National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) is seen as a model for appraising the value of new 
treatments and NICE approval is required for treatments to be funded in the UK. 
In order to compare different disease conditions they use a generic measure, 
preferring the EQ-5D. We have performed a literature search of clinical trials 
in advanced breast cancer to establish which QOL measures have been used. Our 
findings show marked heterogeneity in terms of which QOL tools are used. It is 
suggested that there should be more consensus on which QOL instruments are used, 
not only between researchers, but between them and the bodies that approve 
funding.

Burden of disease resulting from chronic mountain sickness among young Chinese 
male immigrants in Tibet.

(1)Department of Health Service, College of High Altitude Military Medicine, 
Third Military Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street, Shapingba District, 
Chongqing, 400038, PR China.

BACKGROUND: In young Chinese men of the highland immigrant population, chronic 
mountain sickness (CMS) is a major public health problem. The aim of this study 
was to measure the disease burden of CMS in this population.
METHODS: We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to estimate the disease 
burden of CMS. Disability weights were derived using the person trade-off 
methodology. CMS diagnoses, symptom severity, and individual characteristics 
were obtained from surveys collected in Tibet in 2009 and 2010. The DALYs of 
individual patients and the DALYs/1,000 were calculated.
RESULTS: Disability weights were obtained for 21 CMS health stages. The results 
of the analyses of the two surveys were consistent with each other. At different 
altitudes, the CMS rates ranged from 2.1-37.4%; the individual DALYs of patients 
ranged from 0.13-0.33, and the DALYs/1,000 ranged from 3.60-52.78. The age, 
highland service years, blood pressure, heart rate, smoking rate, and proportion 
of the sample working in engineering or construction were significantly higher 
in the CMS group than in the non-CMS group (p < 0.05). These variables were also 
positively associated with the individual DALYs (p < 0.05). Among the symptoms, 
headaches caused the largest proportion of DALYs.
CONCLUSION: The results show that CMS imposes a considerable burden on Chinese 
immigrants to Tibet. Immigrants with characteristics such as a higher 
residential altitude, more advanced age, longer highland service years, being a 
smoker, and working in engineering or construction were more likely to develop 
CMS and to increase the disease burden. Higher blood pressure and heart rate as 
a result of CMS were also positively associated with the disease burden. The 
authorities should pay attention to the highland disease burden and support the 
development and application of DALYs studies of CMS and other highland diseases.

Estimating the length of waits: a description of the period lifetable method and 
comparison with census and event based methods.

UK. P.W.Armstrong@UEL.ac.uk

To discover whether the period lifetable provides more valid estimates of length 
of wait in prospect than are obtained using the lengths either of (current) 
waits captured at the time of the mid-period census or of the (prior) waits of 
those extracted over a specified period. We determined whether there was a 
surplus (or a deficiency) of extractions within the cross-classification of 
cohort and waiting time category which straddled each census. We used census-, 
event- and lifetable-based methods to produce three period-specific estimates of 
the percentage of waits of 0-2 months, and we determined whether length of wait 
grew shorter (or longer) from one period to the next. We used Lambda B to 
indicate the extent to which we were able to predict the direction of change in 
length of wait once we knew the direction of change in size of list. We found a 
direct correlation between change in length of wait and change in size of list, 
as expected under the stock-flow model, when length of wait was estimated using 
the lifetable for the period (L(B) = 58.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
29-88), but we obtained a null correlation when we used census-based estimates 
(L(B) = 6.45) and we obtained an inverse correlation when we used event-based 
estimates (L(B) = 57.14, 95% CI = 31-83). The period lifetable appears to 
provide more valid estimates of length of wait and should therefore be 
substituted for census- and event-based methods of estimation, wherever 
possible.

Does increased health care spending afford better health care outcomes? Evidence 
from Austrian health care expenditure since the implementation of DRGs.

AIMS: While it is commonly accepted that health care costs have been rising to 
unprecedented levels, the question remains whether the increased expenditure 
actually affords increased health outcomes. It was the objective of this study 
to search for associations between health care spending and health care outcome, 
after adjusting for potential confounding variables, using aggregate data 
collected since the introduction of diagnosis-related groups (DRG) into Austrian 
health care financing in 1997.
METHODS: Two parameters of health care outcome, mortality and years of life lost 
(YLL), were regressed on direct and indirect measures of health care spending. 
We used ordinary least squares, Prais-Winsten, and 2-stage least squares 
regression in model building to account for autocorrelation and endogeneity.
RESULTS: Our findings showed that health care spending was associated with 
mortality and YLL reduction. The strongest association among the independent 
variables was seen for spending for prevention. The strongest association for 
the dependent variables was seen for cardiovascular disease followed by 
injuries. Also, socio-economic status (SES) was shown to be an important 
confounder in all studied associations. Our data suggest that increases in 
health care spending produce significant increases in health.
CONCLUSION: Health care spending should not be constrained, but instead an 
optimised resource allocation would afford an increase in health per 
expenditure. Emphasising spending in prevention and reduction of SES gradients 
would strengthen this association.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of booklet based 
vestibular rehabilitation with and without telephone support for chronic 
dizziness, compared with routine care.
DESIGN: Single blind, parallel group, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: 35 general practices across southern England between October 2008 and 
January 2011.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 years or over with chronic dizziness (mean 
duration >five years) not attributable to non-vestibular causes (confirmed by 
general practitioner) and that could be aggravated by head movement (confirmed 
by patient).
INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomly allocated to receive routine medical care, 
booklet based vestibular rehabilitation only, or booklet based vestibular 
rehabilitation with telephone support. For the booklet approach, participants 
received self management booklets providing comprehensive advice on undertaking 
vestibular rehabilitation exercises at home daily for up to 12 weeks and using 
cognitive behavioural techniques to promote positive beliefs and treatment 
adherence. Participants receiving telephone support were offered up to three 
brief sessions of structured support from a vestibular therapist.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vertigo symptom scale-short form and total healthcare 
costs related to dizziness per quality adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Of 337 randomised participants, 276 (82%) completed all clinical 
measures at the primary endpoint, 12 weeks, and 263 (78%) at one year follow-up. 
We analysed clinical effectiveness by intention to treat, using analysis of 
covariance to compare groups after intervention, controlling for baseline 
symptom scores. At 12 weeks, scores on the vertigo symptom scale in the 
telephone support group did not differ significantly from those in the routine 
care group (adjusted mean difference -1.79 (95% confidence interval -3.69 to 
0.11), P=0.064). At one year, both intervention groups improved significantly 
relative to routine care (telephone support -2.52 (-4.52 to -0.51), P=0.014; 
booklet only -2.43 (-4.27 to -0.60), P=0.010). Analysis of cost effectiveness 
acceptability curves showed that both interventions were highly cost effective; 
at very low QALY values, the booklet only approach was most likely to be cost 
effective, but the approach with additional telephone support was most likely to 
be cost effective at QALY values more than £1200 (€1488; $1932). Using the 
booklet approach with telephone support, five (three to 12) patients would need 
to be treated for one patient to report subjective improvement at one year.
CONCLUSIONS: Booklet based vestibular rehabilitation for chronic dizziness is a 
simple and cost effective means of improving patient reported outcomes in 
primary care.

The health and life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
Australians is well known. Over 60% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people live in capital cities or regional centres. The Aboriginal Medical 
Service Redfern has been providing accessible primary healthcare to this 
population for over 40 years. This article describes the work of the Aboriginal 
Medical Service Redfern and reflects on strategies to improve access to primary 
care services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

The sodium-dependent phosphate transporter NaPi2b is overexpressed in 70%–90% of 
ovarian cancers (1). Although NaPi2b is believed to maintain phosphate 
homeostasis in the human body, the exact role of this transporter in neoplastic 
transformation and ovarian cancer tumor growth is unclear. Investigators have 
developed a murine anti- NaPi2b monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated MX35, and 
showed that 211At-labeled MX35 ([211At]MX35) can be used for the intraperitoneal 
radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of micrometastatic growth of OVCAR-3 cells (human 
ovarian cancer cells) in the peritoneum of nude mice (2). In a phase 1 study, 
the pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of the 211At-labeled MX35 F(ab')2 fragment 
were investigated in patients with ovarian cancer (3). From this study it was 
apparent that 211At (half-life, 7.2 h) is likely to irradiate other normal 
organs in the body by travelling through blood circulation (3, 4). In addition, 
it was reported that the efficacy of 211At reduces with the increase in lesion 
size because the radionuclide has a path length of 46–68 μm in the tissue (1, 
3). In this regard, 213Bi appears to be a more suitable radionuclide for RIT of 
the ovarian cancer lesions because it has a short half-life (~46 min), a path 
length of 82 μm in the tissue, and probably does not travel to other organs 
because of its short half-life (3). As an extension of the earlier studies, the 
investigators labeled MX35 with 213Bi ([213Bi]MX35) and compared its 
biodistribution with that of [211At]MX35 in normal nude mice (3). It is 
pertinent to mention that 213Bi is transformed primarily to 213Po (half-life, 
4.2 sec) which in turn decays to 209Pb (half-life, 3.2 h). There is a 
probability that the two nuclear transformations of 213Bi would occur during 
circulation and the final radionuclide (209Pb) may not be retained on the 
chelating agent-mAb complex. Therefore, the biodistribution of the labeled mAb 
presented here may not be that of the mAb itself.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease affecting multiple organs. There are 
about 30,000 patients with CF in the United States, resulting from mutations in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, as well as 
its protein product. The life expectancy of CF patients has increased steadily 
over recent years, with the current expectation being for them to live into 
their late 30s. This is due to increased understanding, and therapeutic advances 
in the CF treatment armamentarium.

Evaluating the competing risks of HIV acquisition and maternal mortality in 
Africa: a decision analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To model the risk of HIV acquisition and maternal mortality for women 
in four African countries in the light of previous data on risk of HIV 
acquisition and hormonal contraceptive use.
DESIGN: Decision analysis.
SETTING: Chad, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.
POPULATION: Women of reproductive age, at risk of HIV, who do not desire 
pregnancy.
METHODS: A decision analysis model was built to compare the consequences of 
removing progestin injectables from use, assuming an increased risk of HIV 
acquisition. Three scenarios were considered in four African countries: 
replacement of progestin injectables with no method, with combined oral 
contraceptives (COC) or with an intrauterine device (IUD). Health outcomes 
measured include: life-years, maternal mortality, HIV acquisition and unsafe 
abortion. Sensitivity analysis, including Monte Carlo simulation, was performed 
around all variables.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV acquisition, maternal mortality and life-years.
RESULTS: If progestin injectables are removed from use, without a minimum of 
70-100% of women switching to an IUD or COCs, up to nine additional maternal 
deaths will occur for every case of HIV averted. Sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that this finding persisted across a broad range of variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Contraception is critical to preserving life for women in Africa. 
In the absence of clear evidence regarding hormonal contraception and HIV 
acquisition, policy decisions must not overlook the very real risk of maternal 
mortality.

Economic analyses of substance misuse prevention assess the intervention cost 
necessary to achieve a particular outcome, and thereby provide an additional 
dimension for evaluating prevention programming. This article reviews several 
types of economic analysis, considers how they can be applied to substance 
misuse prevention, and discusses challenges to enhancing their international 
relevance, particularly their usefulness for informing policy decisions. 
Important first steps taken to address these challenges are presented, including 
the disease burden concept and the development of generalized 
cost-effectiveness, advances that facilitate international policy discussions by 
providing a common framework for evaluating health care needs and program 
effects.

Providence, RI 02905-2499, USA. gbender@wihri.org

OBJECTIVE: Hospital length of stay (LOS) is important to administrators and 
families of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A 
prediction model for NICU LOS was developed using predictors birth weight, 
gestational age and two severity of illness tools, the score for neonatal acute 
physiology, perinatal extension (SNAPPE) and the morbidity assessment index for 
newborns (MAIN).
STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive admissions (n=293) to a New England regional level III 
NICU were retrospectively collected. Multiple predictive models were compared 
for complexity and goodness-of-fit, coefficient of determination (R (2)) and 
predictive error. The optimal model was validated prospectively with consecutive 
admissions (n=615). Observed and expected LOS was compared.
RESULT: The MAIN models had best Akaike's information criterion, highest R (2) 
(0.786) and lowest predictive error. The best SNAPPE model underestimated LOS, 
with substantial variability, yet was fairly well calibrated by birthweight 
category. LOS was longer in the prospective cohort than the retrospective 
cohort, without differences in birth weight, gestational age, MAIN or SNAPPE.
CONCLUSION: LOS prediction is improved by accounting for severity of illness in 
the first week of life, beyond factors known at birth. Prospective validation of 
both MAIN and SNAPPE models is warranted.

Time trade-off and attitudes toward euthanasia: implications of using 'death' as 
an anchor in health state valuation.

PURPOSE: Health state values are by convention anchored to 'perfect health' and 
'death.' Attitudes toward death may consequently influence the valuations. We 
used attitudes toward euthanasia (ATE) as a sub-construct for attitudes toward 
death. We compared the influence on values elicited with time trade-off (TTO), 
lead-time TTO (LT-TTO) and visual analogue scale (VAS).Since the 'death' anchor 
is most explicit in TTO, we hypothesized that TTO values would be most 
influenced by ATE.
METHODS: Respondents valued eight EQ-5D health states with VAS, then TTO 
(n = 328) or LT-TTO (n = 484). We measured ATE on a scale from -2 (fully 
disagree) to 2 (fully agree) and used multiple linear regressions to predict 
VAS, TTO, and LT-TTO values by ATE, sex, age, and education.
RESULTS: A one-point increase on the ATE scale predicted a mean TTO value change 
of -.113 and LT-TTO change of -.072. Demographic variables, but not ATE, 
predicted VAS values.
CONCLUSIONS: TTO appears to measure ATE in addition to preferences for health 
states. Different ways of incorporating death in the valuation may impact 
substantially on the resulting values. 'Death' is a metaphysically unknown 
concept, and implications of attitudes toward death should be investigated 
further to evaluate the appropriateness of using 'death' as an anchor.

Can EQ-5D and 15D be used interchangeably in economic evaluations? Assessing 
quality of life in post-stroke patients.

This paper provides an analysis on the use of 15D and EQ-5D to measure health 
related quality of life. Measures like these are often used interchangeably in 
cost-effectiveness studies. However, it is unclear whether they measure the same 
level of health in the same patients. The empirical performance of the two 
multi-attribute utility instruments is tested in terms of feasibility, utility 
score, linear relationship and agreement by using a novel Norwegian data set. 
The paper also includes an analysis of how the instruments rank individuals in 
terms of health status, and their discriminatory power are tested. The results 
show that EQ-5D and 15D should not be used interchangeably in economic 
evaluations. EQ-5D is likely to give a more favourable cost utility ratio than 
15D. The utility scores generated from the two instruments differ significantly 
different from each other, even though they correlate well. The instruments also 
rank individuals in terms of health status differently.

Caring for people with intellectual disabilities and life-limiting illness: 
merging person-centered planning and patient-centered, family-focused care.

Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154-5032, USA. Abbie.Kirkendall@unlv.edu

The number of older people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) is increasing in 
parallel to the lengthening life expectancy of the overall population. Little is 
known about the needs of older people with IDs who are at life's end. Service 
providers who offer direct care to people with IDs have begun to develop 
partnerships with hospice and palliative care specialists to provide focused 
care that is more specialized for their clients or residents who are approaching 
the end of life. However, community-based programs utilize different 
philosophies of care that focus on the daily management of people with IDs 
compared to programs that focus on care at the end of life. Merging these two 
approaches to care in community-based residences or community-based programs for 
people with IDs brings challenges for both types of programs. This article 
compares person-centered planning and patient-focused, family-centered care and 
proposes means for merging the two seemingly disparate approaches to care.

Alzheimer's disease is a fatal neurological disorder that is a leading cause of 
death, with its prevalence increasing as the average life expectancy increases 
worldwide. There is an urgent need to develop new therapeutics for this disease. 
A newly described protein, the γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP), has been 
proposed to promote elevated levels of amyloid-β production, an activity that 
seems to be inhibited using the well-establish cancer drug, imatinib (Gleevec). 
Despite much interest in this protein, there has been little biochemical 
characterization of GSAP. Here we report protocols for the recombinant bacterial 
expression and purification of this potentially important protein. GSAP is 
expressed in inclusion bodies, which can be solubilized using harsh detergents 
or urea; however, traditional methods of refolding were not successful in 
generating soluble forms of the protein that contained well-ordered and 
homogeneous tertiary structure. However, GSAP could be solubilized in detergent 
micelle solutions, where it was seen to be largely α-helical but to adopt only 
heterogeneous tertiary structure. Under these same conditions, GSAP did not 
associate with either imatinib or the 99-residue transmembrane C-terminal domain 
of the amyloid precursor protein. These results highlight the challenges that 
will be faced in attempts to manipulate and characterize this protein.

Sativex® in multiple sclerosis spasticity: a cost-effectiveness model.

Slof J(1), Gras A.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive disease that 
carries a high socioeconomic burden. Spasticity (rigidity and spasms) is common 
in MS and a key contributor to MS-related disability.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Sativex®, a 
9-d-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol-based oromucosal spray that acts as an 
endocannabinoid system modulator. Sativex was recently approved for the 
management of resistant MS spasticity as add-on medication.
METHODS: A Markov model-based analysis was performed over a 5-year horizon from 
a German and Spanish healthcare payer perspective. The incremental cost of 
Sativex was low compared with current spasticity treatments, and provided a 
quality-adjusted life-year gain over the current standard of care.
RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Sativex was 
estimated at €11,214/quality-adjusted life-year in Germany, while the drug was 
the dominant option in Spain, providing savings of €3496/patient over a 5-year 
period (year of costing: 2010). This was seen because the lower severity of 
spasticity in patients who had improved led to reduced resource consumption 
(e.g., physiotherapy and medications).
CONCLUSION: Despite having a relatively high acquisition cost, Sativex was shown 
to be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with MS-related spasticity.

Glycoengineering approach to half-life extension of recombinant biotherapeutics.

The potential for protein-engineered biotherapeutics is enormous, but 
pharmacokinetic modulation is a major challenge. Manipulating pharmacokinetics, 
biodistribution, and bioavailability of small peptide/protein units such as 
antibody fragments is a major pharmaceutical ambition, illustrated by the many 
chemical conjugation and recombinant fusion approaches being developed. We 
describe a recombinant approach that leads to successful incorporation of 
polysialic acid, PSA for the first time, onto a therapeutically valuable 
protein. This was achieved by protein engineering of the PSA carrier domain of 
NCAM onto single-chain Fv antibody fragments (one directed against 
noninternalizing carcinoembryonic antigen-CEA and one against internalizing 
human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-HER2). This created novel 
polysialylated antibody fragments with desired pharmacokinetics. Production was 
achieved in human embryonic kidney cells engineered to express human 
polysialyltransferase, and the recombinant, glycosylated product was 
successfully fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography. Polysialylation was 
verified by glycosidase digestion and mass spectrometry, which showed the 
correct glycan structures and PSA chain length similar to that of native NCAM. 
Binding was demonstrated by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance and on live 
cells by flow cytometry and confocal immunofluorescence. Unexpectedly, 
polysialylation inhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis of the anti-HER2 scFv. 
Recombinant polysialylation led to an estimated 3-fold increase in hydrodynamic 
radius, comparable to PEGylation, leading to an almost 30-fold increase in blood 
half-life and a similar increase in blood exposure. This increase in 
bioavailability led to a 12-fold increase in tumor uptake by 24 h. In summary, 
recombinant polysialylation of antibody fragments in our system is a novel and 
feasible approach applicable for pharmacokinetic modulation, and may have wider 
applications.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of universal newborn screening for medium chain 
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in France.

(HAS), 2 avenue du Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France. f.hamers@has-sante.fr

BACKGROUND: Five diseases are currently screened on dried blood spots in France 
through the national newborn screening programme. Tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS) is a technology that is increasingly used to screen newborns for an 
increasing number of hereditary metabolic diseases. Medium chain acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is among these diseases. We sought to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of introducing MCADD screening in France.
METHODS: We developed a decision model to evaluate, from a societal perspective 
and a lifetime horizon, the cost-effectiveness of expanding the French newborn 
screening programme to include MCADD. Published and, where available, routine 
data sources were used. Both costs and health consequences were discounted at an 
annual rate of 4%. The model was applied to a French birth cohort. One-way 
sensitivity analyses and worst-case scenario simulation were performed.
RESULTS: We estimate that MCADD newborn screening in France would prevent each 
year five deaths and the occurrence of neurological sequelae in two children 
under 5 years, resulting in a gain of 128 life years or 138 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY). The incremental cost per year is estimated at €2.5 million, 
down to €1 million if this expansion is combined with a replacement of the 
technology currently used for phenylketonuria screening by MS/MS. The resulting 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is estimated at €7 580/QALY. 
Sensitivity analyses indicate that while the results are robust to variations in 
the parameters, the model is most sensitive to the cost of neurological 
sequelae, MCADD prevalence, screening effectiveness and screening test cost. The 
worst-case scenario suggests an ICER of €72 000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Although France has not defined any threshold for judging whether 
the implementation of a health intervention is an efficient allocation of public
