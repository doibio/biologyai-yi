BACKGROUND: Drowning is a leading cause of injury-related mortality globally. 
Unintentional drowning (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes 
W65-74 and ICD9 E910) is one of the 30 mutually exclusive and collectively 
exhaustive causes of injury-related mortality in the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) study. This study's objective is to describe unintentional drowning using 
GBD estimates from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: Unintentional drowning from GBD 2017 was estimated for cause-specific 
mortality and years of life lost (YLLs), age, sex, country, region, 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile, and trends from 1990 to 2017. GBD 2017 
used standard GBD methods for estimating mortality from drowning.
RESULTS: Globally, unintentional drowning mortality decreased by 44.5% between 
1990 and 2017, from 531 956 (uncertainty interval (UI): 484 107 to 572 854) to 
295 210 (284 493 to 306 187) deaths. Global age-standardised mortality rates 
decreased 57.4%, from 9.3 (8.5 to 10.0) in 1990 to 4.0 (3.8 to 4.1) per 100 000 
per annum in 2017. Unintentional drowning-associated mortality was generally 
higher in children, males and in low-SDI to middle-SDI countries. China, India, 
Pakistan and Bangladesh accounted for 51.2% of all drowning deaths in 2017. 
Oceania was the region with the highest rate of age-standardised YLLs in 2017, 
with 45 434 (40 850 to 50 539) YLLs per 100 000 across both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a decline in global drowning rates. This study shows 
that the decline was not consistent across countries. The results reinforce the 
need for continued and improved policy, prevention and research efforts, with a 
focus on low- and middle-income countries.

Multiple Sclerosis: Clinical Updates in Women's Health Care Primary and 
Preventive Care Review.

Fang X, Patel C, Gudesblatt M.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of 
the central nervous system. The disease affects more women than men and often is 
diagnosed during a woman's childbearing years. Typical clinical presentations of 
the disease are extensive and variable, with symptoms that include dysregulated 
mood, fatigue, vision problems, weakness, tremor, imbalance, abnormal 
sensations, bladder dysfunction, and heat sensitivity. If a woman aged 15-50 
years experiences these neurologic symptoms in isolation or combination, and the 
symptoms are not explained by other underlying medical conditions, MS should be 
suspected. Multiple sclerosis can be divided into four clinical subtypes: 1) 
relapsing-remitting MS, 2) secondary progressive MS, 3) primary progressive MS, 
and 4) clinically isolated syndrome. Relapsing-remitting MS at the time of onset 
is the most common form and accounts for approximately 80% of all cases of MS. 
Relapsing-remitting MS does not affect life expectancy. However, because of the 
neurodegenerative and progressive course of the disease, patients accumulate 
physical and cognitive disabilities over time that result in impaired ability to 
work, increased financial burden, and slightly increased mortality. A variety of 
possible risk and prognostic indicators have been identified that may predict 
the course of disease, particularly the extent of relapses and disability. 
Multiple sclerosis currently is incurable, but many disease-modifying therapies 
are available that can reduce the frequency of clinically evident exacerbations 
and accumulation of disease burden as defined by the number of lesions 
identified on magnetic resonance imaging. The choice of disease-modifying 
therapies, contraception use, and treatment of symptoms should be individualized 
based on age at onset and disease activity and, during pregnancy, the 
gestational age. Proactive management of MS across the woman's life cycle 
reduces morbidity, improves maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and the 
postpartum period, and increases quality-of life-measures for patients and their 
families.

The ladybird beetle, Harmonia sedecimnotata (F.) was studied in biology, life 
table, consumption rates, molecular characterization, and field evaluation. The 
net reproductive rate (R0), based on the age-stage and two-sex life table, was 
43.2 eggs/individual. The female adults lived longer (68.1 d) than the male 
adults (62.9 d). The rate of consumption increased with progress in each stage 
of development. Compared to the other larval stages of the predator, the fourth 
stadium consumed most quantities of Aphis gossypii Glover nymphs (Hemiptera: 
Aphididae) (200.4). Both female (2214.6) and male (1792.4) consumed more prey 
(nymphs) than larvae. The net rate of consumption was 1458.92 nymphs of melon 
aphids. There was no variation in the sequences of the two nucleotides out of 
583 bp, H sedecimnotata China (EU392410) and India (MG720024). Our 
investigations demonstrated that inoculative release of 30 or 40 or 50 adults 
per 100 m2 attained high reduction of aphids (>90%). Thus, it may be recommended 
the release rate of 40 adults per 100 m2 to suppress the eggplant aphid 
population. H. sedecimnotata is therefore one of the most promising biological 
control agents for cotton aphids that can be achieved for instant control 
through an inoculative release of adults.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the healthy life years (HLY) lost as a result of mental 
disorders and nervous system diseases in Medellin from 2006 to 2012.
METHODS: Descriptive study using a secondary information source according to the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. To calculate the years of potential 
life lost (YPLL), we used vital statistics data; to calculate 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY), we used morbidity data from individual 
records managed by health service providers, outpatient clinics and other 
research studies. HLY are the sum of YPLL and DALY.
RESULTS: In Medellin, from 2006 to 2012, out of 1,242,407 HLY related to mental 
disorders and nervous system diseases, the vast majority (99.39%) were due to 
disability. Most HLY were found in females (70.22%) and 81% were found in people 
aged 15 to 59. The disorders representing the greatest burden were unipolar 
depressive disorder (81%), Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia 
(4.82%), schizophrenia (3.5%) and drug use disorders (2.78%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a significant increase in the disease burden 
due to mental disorders and nervous system diseases. Public policy 
decision-makers in the city of Medellin should take note, as health problems of 
this type can result in a substantial rise in healthcare costs.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Less than 4% of patients with kidney failure receive 
kidney transplants. Although discard rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic 
kidneys are declining, ~39% of HCV-viremic kidneys donated between 2018 and 2019 
were discarded. Highly effective antiviral agents are now available to treat 
chronic HCV infection. Thus, our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness 
of transplanting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors into HCV-uninfected recipients.
STUDY DESIGN: Markov state transition decision model. Data sources include 
Medline search results, bibliographies from relevant English language articles, 
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, and the US Renal Data System.
SETTING & POPULATION: US patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis who are on 
kidney transplant waiting lists.
INTERVENTION(S): Transplantation with an HCV-unexposed kidney versus 
transplantation with an HCV-viremic kidney and HCV treatment.
OUTCOMES: Effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years and costs 
measured in 2018 US dollars.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, AND TIMEFRAME: We used a health care system perspective with 
a lifelong time horizon.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, transplantation with an HCV-viremic kidney 
was more effective and less costly than transplantation with an HCV-unexposed 
kidney because of the longer waiting times for HCV-unexposed kidneys, the 
substantial excess mortality risk while receiving dialysis, and the high 
efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV infection. Transplantation 
with an HCV-viremic kidney was also preferred in sensitivity analyses of 
multiple model parameters. The strategy remained cost-effective unless waiting 
list time for an HCV-viremic kidney exceeded 3.1 years compared with the 
base-case value of 1.56 year.
LIMITATIONS: Estimates of waiting times for patients willing to accept an 
HCV-viremic kidney were based on data for patients who received HCV-viremic 
kidney transplants.
CONCLUSIONS: Transplanting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors into HCV-uninfected 
recipients increased quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduced costs compared 
with a strategy of transplanting kidneys from HCV-unexposed donors.

BACKGROUND: The recommended target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
level for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients has been lowered from 100 to 
70 mg/dL in several clinical guidelines for secondary prevention. We aimed to 
assess whether initiating statin treatment in CAD patients with baseline LDL-C 
70-100 mg/dL in Taiwan could be cost-effective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of CAD 
patients with a baseline LDL-C level of 90 mg/dL. The incidence and recurrence 
of MI and stroke related to specific LDL-C levels as well as the statin effect, 
mortality rate, and health state utilities were obtained from the literature. 
The direct medical costs and rate of fatal events were derived from the national 
claims database. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was calculated, and sensitivity analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: Moderate-intensity statin use, a treatment regimen expected to achieve 
LDL <70 mg/dL in the base case, resulted in a net gain of 562 QALYs but with an 
additional expenditure of $11.4 million per 10,000 patients over ten years. The 
ICER was $20,288 per QALY gained. The probabilities of being cost-effective at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of one and three gross domestic product per capita 
($24,329 in 2017) per QALY were 51.1% and 94.2%, respectively. Annual drug cost 
was the most influential factor on the ICER.
CONCLUSION: Lowering the target LDL-C level from 100 to 70 mg/dL among

of preventing cardiovascular events and deaths.

This study compared mortality rates and decline in life expectancy of Iranian 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with the general population. A 
retrospective study of 2451 patients with T2DM was conducted in the Isfahan 
Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Iran, between 1992 and 2010. The mean 
(SD) of diabetes duration and median (Q1,Q3) of follow-up period were 15.5(8.0) 
and 8(5, 10) years. The main outcome was all-cause mortality. 732(29.87%) of 
patients died during the follow-up. Overall mortality rates (95%CI) per 1000 
person-years in men and women were 56.3(52.0-62.1) and 27.3(24.5-30.4), 
respectively. The relative risks (95%CI) of all-cause mortality in males vs. 
females with T2DM aged 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74 were 
[3.02(1.49-6.11) vs. 2.09(0.96-4.57)], [4.05(2.73-6.01) vs. 2.29(1.52-3.45)], 
[4.13(3.26-5.24) vs. 1.70(1.23-2.35)], [2.42(1.90-3.07) vs. 1.82(1.46-2.27)], 
[2.36(2.02-2.76) vs. 1.49(1.25-1.78)] and [1.71(1.50-1.95) vs. 1.04(0.88-1.23)] 
times more than the general population, respectively. Men and women living with 
diabetes lost an average of 13.2(6.3) and 13.9(6.0) life-years from the year of 
diagnosis, respectively (p = 0.101). The estimated life-years lost were greater 
in younger patients and a gradual decline was observed with increasing the age 
at diagnosis. In conclusion, Iranians with diabetes had higher risk of death and 
lower life expectancy compared to the general population.

Drosophila hemocytes, like those of mammals, are given rise from two distinctive 
phases during both the embryonic and larval hematopoiesis. Embryonically derived 
hemocytes, mostly composed of macrophage-like plasmatocytes, are largely 
identified by genetic markers. However, the cellular diversity and distinct 
functions of possible subpopulations within plasmatocytes have not been explored 
in Drosophila larvae. Here, we show that larval plasmatocytes exhibit 
differential expressions of Hemolectin (Hml) and Peroxidasin (Pxn) during 
development. Moreover, removal of plasmatocytes by overexpressing pro-apoptotic 
genes, hid and reaper in Hml-positive plasmatocytes, feeding high sucrose diet, 
or wasp infestation results in increased circulating hemocytes that are 
Hml-negative. Interestingly these Hml-negative plasmatocytes retain Pxn 
expression, and animals expressing Hml-negative and Pxn-positive subtype largely 
attenuate growth and abrogate metabolism. Furthermore, elevated levels of a 
cytokine, unpaired 3, are detected when Hml-positive hemocytes are ablated, 
which in turn activates JAK/STAT activity in several tissues including the fat 
body. Finally, we observed that insulin signaling is inhibited in this 
background, which can be recovered by concurrent loss of upd3. Overall, this 
study highlights heterogeneity in Drosophila plasmatocytes and a functional 
plasticity of each subtype, which reaffirms extension of their role beyond 
immunity into metabolic regulation for cooperatively maintaining internal 
homeostatic balance.

Significant Quality of Life Improvement Observed in a Patient With FCS 
Associated With a Marked Reduction in Triglycerides.

Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized 
by severely high triglycerides (TGs). It is associated with a marked increase in 
risk of recurrent, potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP), and symptoms 
including abdominal pain, fatigue, and anxiety that may substantially reduce 
quality of life (QoL). A 46-year-old woman with FCS and severely high TGs 
initially presented with necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocysts, having 
previously experienced recurrent AP. The patient reported constant abdominal 
pain and fatigue, which were evident in her demeanor. Initial management 
included maximum doses of omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates, plus an extremely 
restricted diet (reduced intake: calories, fats, simple sugars; no alcohol). 
Despite adherence to all management strategies, TGs remained at approximately 
2800 mg/dL (31.6 mmol/L) and symptoms persisted. The patient was enrolled in 
COMPASS, a phase 3, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of an 
investigational drug, volanesorsen, on fasting TGs in patients with 
hypertriglyceridemia (fasting TGs ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥5.7 mmol/L]). The woman, a 
confirmed FCS patient, continued into the open-label extension study, during 
which fasting TGs decreased to 146 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) following 4 months of 
treatment. The restrictive diet was maintained throughout treatment and no 
serious adverse events were reported. Along with sustained TG reduction, the 
patient experienced progressive, perceived improvements in observable QoL 
measures and a marked reduction in symptom severity and frequency. In a patient 
with FCS, reduction in TGs following volanesorsen therapy appeared to be 
associated with marked improvement in clinical symptoms and observed QoL.

Cost-effectiveness is traditionally treated as a static estimate driven by 
clinical trial efficacy and drug price at launch. Prior studies suggest that 
cost-effectiveness varies over the drug's lifetime. We examined the impact of 
"learning by doing," one of the least studied drivers of changes in 
cost-effectiveness across the product life cycle. We combined time-series trends 
in effectiveness over time by cancer regimen using the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. We estimated the time-varying 
effects of treatments in colorectal and pancreatic cancer over their life cycle, 
including FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine, 
on survival of patients. Mean prices over time by strength and dosage form were 
calculated using historical wholesale acquisition costs. We found consistent 
downward trends in the mortality hazard ratios, which suggest that effectiveness 
improves over time. In the case of first-line FOLFOX for colorectal cancer, the 
implied incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on the observational data 
fell from $610,000 per life year gained in 2004 to $27,000 per life year gained 
in 2011. Cost-effectiveness estimated at launch is unlikely to be representative 
of cost-effectiveness over the drug's lifetime. In the drugs studied, the impact 
of time-varying clinical effectiveness dominated the impact of changing prices 
overtime.

Although the extensive rollout of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy resulted in a 
longer life expectancy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus 
(PLHIV), such individuals display a relatively increased occurrence of 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This health challenge stimulated significant 
research interests in the field, leading to an improved understanding of both 
lifestyle-related risk factors and the underlying mechanisms of CVD onset in 
PLHIV. However, despite such progress, the precise role of various risk factors 
and mechanisms underlying the development of HIV-mediated CVD still remains 
relatively poorly understood. Therefore, we review CVD onset in PLHIV and focus 
on 1) the spectrum of cardiovascular complications that typically manifest in 
such persons and 2) underlying mechanisms that are implicated in this process. 
Here, the contributions of such factors and modulators and underlying mechanisms 
are considered in a holistic and integrative manner to generate a unifying 
hypothesis that includes identification of the core pathways mediating CVD 
onset. The review focuses on the sub-Saharan African context, as there are 
relatively high numbers of PLHIV residing within this region, indicating that 
the greater CVD risk will increasingly threaten the well-being and health of its 
citizens. It is our opinion that such an approach helps point the way for future 
research efforts to improve treatment strategies and/or lifestyle-related 
modifications for PLHIV.

This paper proposes an approach for visualizing individuality and 
inter-individual variations of human brain oscillations measured as multichannel 
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in a low-dimensional space based on 
manifold learning. Using a unified divergence measure between spectral densities 
termed the "beta-divergence", we introduce an appropriate dissimilarity measure 
between multichannel EEG signals. Then, t-distributed stochastic neighbor 
embedding (t-SNE; a state-of-the-art algorithm for manifold learning) together 
with the beta-divergence based distance was applied to resting state EEG signals 
recorded from 100 healthy subjects. We were able to obtain a fine 
low-dimensional visualization that enabled each subject to be identified as an 
isolated point cloud and that represented inter-individual variations as the 
relationships between such point clouds. Furthermore, we also discuss how the 
performance of the low-dimensional visualization depends on the beta-divergence 
parameter and the t-SNE hyper parameter. Finally, borrowing from the concept of 
locally linear embedding (LLE), we propose a method for projecting the test 
sample to the t-SNE space obtained from the training samples and investigate 
that availability.

As components of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) olive polyphenols may play a 
crucial role for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since mitochondrial 
dysfunction is involved in both, brain ageing and early AD, effects of 10 
different purified phenolic secoiridoids (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, oleacein, 
oleuroside, oleuroside aglycon, oleuropein, oleocanthal, ligstroside, 
ligstroside aglycone and ligustaloside B) and two metabolites (the plant 
metabolite elenolic acid and the mammalian metabolite homovanillic acid) were 
tested in very low doses on mitochondrial function in SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells - a 
cellular model of early AD. All tested secoiridoids significantly increased 
basal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in SY5Y-APP695 cells. Oleacein, 
oleuroside, oleocanthal and ligstroside showed the highest effect on ATP levels 
and were additionally tested on mitochondrial respiration. Only oleocanthal and 
ligstroside were able to enhance the capacity of respiratory chain complexes. To 
investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms, the expression of genes 
associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration and antioxidative capacity 
(PGC-1α, SIRT1, CREB1, NRF1, TFAM, complex I, IV and V, GPx1, SOD2, CAT) were 
determined using qRT-PCR. Exclusively ligstroside increased mRNA expression of 
SIRT1, CREB1, complex I, and GPx1. Furthermore, oleocanthal but not ligstroside 
decreased Aβ 1-40 levels in SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells. To investigate the in vivo 
effects of purified secoiridoids, the two most promising compounds (oleocanthal 
and ligstroside) were tested in a mouse model of ageing. Female NMRI mice, aged 
12 months, received a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg oleocanthal or ligstroside 
for 6 months (equivalent to 6.25 mg/kg b.w.). Young (3 months) and aged 
(18 months) mice served as controls. Ligstroside fed mice showed improved 
spatial working memory. Furthermore, ligstroside restored brain ATP levels in 
aged mice and led to a significant life extension compared to aged control 
animals. Our findings indicate that purified ligstroside has outstanding 
performance on mitochondrial bioenergetics in models of early AD and brain 
ageing by mechanisms that may not interfere with Aβ production. Additionally, 
ligstroside expanded the lifespan in aged mice and enhanced cognitive function.

In this paper, we use a bivariate choropleth map to investigate the relationship 
between mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita, by sex, in Japanese prefectures from 1996 to 2015. The overall 
results show a decline in age-standardized CVD mortality rates in all 
prefectures, for both men and women, and suggest that GDP per capita has varied 
over the period. We also observed that the relationship between CVD mortality 
rates and GDP per capita at the prefecture level does not have an overall 
pattern of the same or inverse association, but is instead a heterogeneous 
relationship. We argue that this study provides useful clues to policy makers 
for establishing effective measures for public health planning and the 
prevention of deaths from CVD. As demonstrated by this study, mapping of the CVD 
burden in Japan helps to clarify regional differences in life expectancy and 
health status across regions and identify prefectures where more targeted policy 
attention may be needed.

Pollinator nutritional ecology provides insights into plant-pollinator 
interactions, coevolution, and the restoration of declining pollinator 
populations. Bees obtain their protein and lipid nutrient intake from pollen, 
which is essential for larval growth and development as well as adult health and 
reproduction. Our previous research revealed that pollen protein to lipid ratios 
(P:L) shape bumble bee foraging preferences among pollen host-plant species, and 
these preferred ratios link to bumble bee colony health and fitness. Yet, we are 
still in the early stages of integrating data on P:L ratios across plant and bee 
species. Here, using a standard laboratory protocol, we present over 80 plant 
species' protein and lipid concentrations and P:L values, and we evaluate the 
P:L ratios of pollen collected by three bee species. We discuss the general 
phylogenetic, phenotypic, behavioral, and ecological trends observed in these 
P:L ratios that may drive plant-pollinator interactions; we also present future 
research questions to further strengthen the field of pollination nutritional 
ecology. This dataset provides a foundation for researchers studying the 
nutritional drivers of plant-pollinator interactions as well as for stakeholders 
developing planting schemes to best support pollinators.

Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural component that encapsulates 
the viral genome into the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Efficient 
assembly of vRNPs is critical for the virus life cycle. The assembly route from 
RNA-free NP to the NP-RNA polymer in vRNPs has been suggested to require a 
cellular factor UAP56, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we 
characterized the interaction between NP and UAP56 using recombinant proteins 
and showed that UAP56 features two NP binding sites. In addition to the UAP56 
core comprised of two RecA domains, we identified the N-terminal extension (NTE) 
of UAP56 as a previously unknown NP binding site. In particular, UAP56-NTE 
recognizes the nucleic acid binding region of NP. This corroborates our 
observation that binding of UAP56-NTE and RNA to NP is mutually exclusive. 
Collectively, our results reveal the molecular basis for how UAP56 acts on 
RNA-free NP, and provide new insights into NP-mediated influenza genome 
packaging.

BACKGROUND: Evidence has established obesity as a risk factor for total knee 
replacement (TKR) due to osteoarthritis. Obesity is a risk factor for TKR. 
Randomized trials such as Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) have shown
