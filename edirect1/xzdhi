Structural studies of membrane proteins, especially small membrane proteins, are 
associated with well-known experimental challenges. Complexation with monoclonal 
antibody fragments is a common strategy to augment such proteins; however, 
generating antibody fragments that specifically bind a target protein is not 
trivial. Here we identify a helical epitope, from the membrane-proximal external 
region (MPER) of the gp41-transmembrane subunit of the HIV envelope protein, 
that is recognized by several well-characterized antibodies and that can be 
fused as a contiguous extension of the N-terminal transmembrane helix of a broad 
range of membrane proteins. To analyze whether this MPER-epitope tag might aid 
structural studies of small membrane proteins, we determined an X-ray crystal 
structure of a membrane protein target that does not crystallize without the aid 
of crystallization chaperones, the Fluc fluoride channel, fused to the MPER 
epitope and in complex with antibody. We also demonstrate the utility of this 
approach for single particle electron microscopy with Fluc and two additional 
small membrane proteins that represent different membrane protein folds, AdiC 
and GlpF. These studies show that the MPER epitope provides a structurally 
defined, rigid docking site for antibody fragments that is transferable among 
diverse membrane proteins and can be engineered without prior structural 
information. Antibodies that bind to the MPER epitope serve as effective 
crystallization chaperones and electron microscopy fiducial markers, enabling 
structural studies of challenging small membrane proteins.

CONTEXT: Hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) physicians frequently care for 
patients with substance use disorders (SUDs), but there is no consensus on which 
primary addiction medicine (AM) skills are essential.
OBJECTIVES: Identify key primary AM skills that physicians should acquire during 
an ACGME-accredited HPM fellowship program.
METHODS: A modified Delphi study consisting of 18 experts on SUD in HPM and 
medical education. A literature review and expert input identified initial AM 
skills. In three Delphi rounds, participants rated each skill on a nine-point 
scale from "not at all important to include" to "crucial to include." We 
calculated medians (IQRs), analyzed panelists' comments, and grouped skills 
using the RAND / UCLA appropriateness method.
RESULTS: Among 62 proposed AM skills, 53 skills were rated as appropriate to 
include (38 of which achieved agreement), and nine skills were rated as 
uncertain. AM skills most relevant to HPM included 1) defining chemical coping, 
median 8.5 (IQR 2); 2) balancing life expectancy with risks of opioid use for 
patients with SUD, 9 (IQR 0); 3) explaining best practices to dispose unused 
opioids postmortem, 8 (IQR 2); 4) managing pain for hospice patients with SUD, 9 
(IQR 0.75); and 5) partnering with hospice to manage patients on methadone and 
buprenorphine, 9 (IQR 2). Experts did not achieve consensus on whether HPM 
physicians should be encouraged to learn to prescribe buprenorphine for patients 
with opioid use disorder, 6 (IQR 3).
CONCLUSION: HPM fellowships should consider incorporating the primary AM skills 
identified in this study in their curricula.

Since the introduction of episodic and prophylactic treatments with safer factor 
concentrates, the life expectancy of people with haemophilia (PwH) has improved 
considerably. Ageing-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) have 
also become more prevalent in PwH. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate 
CVD risk factors and estimate 10-year risk for CVD events among PwH. Male 
patients ≥ 30 years were interviewed and examined. Blood tests were performed at 
the local laboratory. Eighty-two patients were included, of whom 83% had 
haemophilia A and half had severe disease. Median age at study entry was 
43.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 36.0-51.3). Prevalence of obesity, 
systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and diabetes mellitus were 16%, 60% and 
16%, respectively. Hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and low HDL 
blood levels were present in 18%, 41% and 30% of patients, respectively. 
Metabolic syndrome was found in 37%. The Framingham Risk Score showed that 39% 
of PwH had a high risk of developing cardiovascular events in the following 
10 years. We conclude that, in this cohort, PwH have a higher prevalence of SAH 
when compared with Brazilian men without haemophilia and about two-fifths have a 
high risk of developing a CVD event in the following 10 years.

The evolution of sociality in insects caused a divergence in lifespan between 
reproductive and non-reproductive castes. Ant queens can live for decades, while 
most workers survive only weeks to a few years. In most organisms, longevity is 
traded-off with reproduction, but in social insects, these two life-history 
traits are positively linked. Once fertility is induced in workers, e.g. by 
queen removal, worker lifespan increases. The molecular regulation of this 
positive link between fecundity and longevity and generally the molecular 
underpinnings of caste-specific senescence are not well understood. Here, we 
investigate the transcriptomic regulation of lifespan and reproduction in fat 
bodies of three worker groups in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. In a long-term 
experiment, workers that became fertile in the absence of the queen showed 
increased survival and upregulation of genes involved in longevity and fecundity 
pathways. Interestingly, workers that re-joined their queen after months 
exhibited intermediate ovary development, but retained a high expression of 
longevity and fecundity genes. Strikingly, the queen's presence causes a general 
downregulation of genes in worker fat bodies. Our findings point to long-term 
consequences of fertility induction in workers, even after re-joining their 
queen. Moreover, we reveal longevity genes and pathways modulated during insect 
social evolution. This article is part of the theme issue 'Ageing and sociality: 
why, when and how does sociality change ageing patterns?'

Human life expectancy increases, but the disease-free part of lifespan 
(healthspan) and the quality of life in old people may not show the same 
development. The situation poses considerable challenges to healthcare systems 
and economies, and calls for new strategies to increase healthspan and for 
sustainable future approaches to elder care. This call has motivated innovative 
research on the role of social relationships during ageing. Correlative data 
from clinical surveys indicate that social contact promotes healthy ageing, and 
it is time to reveal the causal mechanisms through experimental research. The 
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a prolific model animal, but insects with 
more developed social behaviour can be equally instrumental for this research. 
Here, we discuss the role of social contact in ageing, and identify lines of 
study where diverse insect models can help uncover the mechanisms that are 
involved. This article is part of the theme issue 'Ageing and sociality: why, 
when and how does sociality change ageing patterns?'

Social insect reproductives exhibit exceptional longevity instead of the classic 
trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproduction. Even normally sterile 
workers experience a significant increase in life expectancy when they assume a 
reproductive role. The mechanisms that enable the positive relation between the 
antagonistic demands of reproduction and somatic maintenance are unclear. To 
isolate the effect of reproductive activation, honeybee workers were induced to 
activate their ovaries. These reproductively activated workers were compared to 
controls for survival and gene expression patterns after exposure to Israeli 
Acute Paralysis Virus or the oxidative stressor paraquat. Reproductive 
activation increased survival, indicating better immunity and oxidative stress 
resistance. After qPCR analysis confirmed our experimental treatments at the 
physiological level, whole transcriptome analysis revealed that paraquat 
treatment significantly changed the expression of 1277 genes in the control 
workers but only two genes in reproductively activated workers, indicating that 
reproductive activation preemptively protects against oxidative stress. 
Significant overlap between genes that were upregulated by reproductive 
activation and in response to paraquat included prominent members of signalling 
pathways and anti-oxidants known to affect ageing. Thus, while our results 
confirm a central role of vitellogenin, they also point to other mechanisms to 
explain the molecular basis of the lack of a cost of reproduction and the 
exceptional longevity of social insect reproductives. Thus, socially induced 
reproductive activation preemptively protects honeybee workers against 
stressors, explaining their longevity. This article is part of the theme issue 
'Ageing and sociality: why, when and how does sociality change ageing patterns?'

Giant mole-rats (Fukomys mechowii) are remarkably long-lived subterranean 
rodents (maximum recorded lifespan as reported here greater than 26 years) that 
live in families with one reproductive pair (breeders) and their 
non-reproductive offspring (non-breeders). Previous studies have shown that 
breeders live on average approximately twice as long as non-breeders, a finding 
contradicting the classic trade-off between reproduction and lifespan. Because 
recent evidence points to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as playing an 
important role in shaping the pace of ageing in mole-rats, we analysed the 
influence of the social environment of giant mole-rats on intrafamilial 
aggression levels, indicators of long-term stress, and, ultimately, mortality. 
Behavioural data indicated that family constellation, especially the presence or 
the absence of parents, influences agonistic behaviour. As a measure of 
long-term stress, we established a non-invasive method of extracting and 
measuring cortisol from hair of giant mole-rats. Interestingly, orphaned 
non-breeders exhibited significantly lower levels of cortisol and lower 
mortality rates than did non-breeders living with both parents. Because 
hypercortisolism is harmful in the long-term, intrafamilial stress could help 
explain the earlier onset of senescence in non-breeders, resulting in a shorter 
lifespan. Our findings suggest that the social environment should be considered 
as a further factor in ageing studies involving group-living animals. This 
article is part of the theme issue 'Ageing and sociality: why, when and how does 
sociality change ageing patterns?'

PURPOSE: Survival after whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with 
multiple brain metastases (BM) is currently predicted by group-based scoring 
systems with limited usability for decision. We aimed to develop a more relevant 
individualized predictive model than Radiation Therapy Oncology 
Group - Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) and Diagnosis - Specific 
Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) for patients with limited life-expectancy.
METHODS: Based on a Discovery cohort of patients undergoing WBRT, multivariable 
piecewise Cox regression models with time cut-offs at 1 and 3 months were 
developed to predict overall survival (OS). A final parsimonious model was 
defined, and an external validation cohort was used to assess its discrimination 
and calibration at one, six, and 12 months.
RESULTS: In the 173-patient Discovery cohort, the majority of patients had 
primary lung cancer (56%), presence of extracranial disease (ECD) (75%), Eastern 
Cooperative Oncolgy Group - Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score 1 (41%) and no 
intracranial hypertension (ICH) (74%). Most patients were classified as the RPA 
class II (48%). The final piecewise Cox model was based on primary site, age, 
ECD, ECOG-PS and ICH. An external validation of the model was carried out using 
a cohort of 79 patients. Individualized survival estimates obtained with this 
model outperformed the RPA and DS-GPA scores for overall survival prediction at 
1-month, 6-months and 12- months in both Discovery and Validation cohorts. A 
R/Shiny web application was developed to obtain individualized predictions for 
new patients, providing an easy-to-use tool for clinicians and researchers.
CONCLUSION: Our model provides individualized estimates of survival for poor 
prognosis patients undergoing WBRT, outperforming actual scoring systems.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the combined effect of chitosan 
dip (1% w/v) and vacuum packaging on the shelf life of fresh chicken burgers 
packaged in LDPE/PA/LDPE bags and stored at 4 ± 1 °C for up to 12 days. 
Furthermore, the possible correlation among microbiological, physico-chemical 
and sensory indices was investigated. Burger treatments included: aerobic 
packaging (AP, control), vacuum packaging (VP), chitosan dipping (CHI), and 
vacuum packaging plus chitosan dipping (VP + CHI). Microbiological [Total viable 
count (TVC), Pseudomonas spp., Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterobacteriaceae, 
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB)], physicochemical [color, pH, total volatile basic 
Nitrogen (TVB-N), and Thiobarbituric acid (TBA)] and sensory (odor, taste, and 
texture) analyses were carried out. Results showed that the majority of 
microbiological, physico-chemical, and sensory analysis parameters varied 
significantly (p < 0.05) depending on treatment. Based primarily on sensory, 
followed by microbiological and physico-chemical data, the shelf life of chicken 
burgers was 4 days for AP samples, 8 days for VP samples, 10 days for CHI 
treated samples, and 12 days for the VP + CHI treated samples. Finally, a 
positive and significant correlation (p < 0.05) was observed among most 
microbiological, sensory, and physico-chemical data, introducing new data 
relating initial TVC to TVB-N values regarding alternative treatments of minced 
chicken meat for its optimum preservation.

We estimate a stochastic life-cycle model of endogenous health spending, asset 
accumulation and retirement to investigate the causes behind the increase in 
health spending and longevity in the U.S. over the period 1965-2005. Accounting 
for changes over time in taxes, transfers, Social Security, income, health 
insurance, smoking and obesity, and technological progress, we estimate that 
technological progress is responsible for half of the increase in life 
expectancy over the period. Substantial growth in health spending over the 
period is largely the result of growth in economic resources and the generosity 
of health insurance, with a modest role for medical technological progress. The 
growth in spending does not come from changes in a single source, but sources 
jointly interacted to increase spending: complementarity effects explain up to 
26.3% of the increase in health spending. Overall, for those born in 1940, the 
combined changes in resources and health insurance that occurred over the period 
are valued at 35.7% of lifetime consumption.

Stabilisation of pathological humerus fractures using cement augmented plating: 
A case series.

The humerus is the second most common long bone for metastatic tumours. These 
lesions result in weakened bone architecture and increased fracture risk with 
patients suffering pain, loss of function and diminished quality of life, often 
when life expectancy is short. Fractures or impending fractures require surgical 
stabilisation to relieve pain and restore function for the remainder of the 
patient's life without the need for further surgery. Conventional management of 
these lesions in the humerus is intramedullary nailing, however there are issues 
with this technique, particularly regarding rigidity of fixation. Advances in 
contoured locking plates have led to the development of different stabilisation 
techniques. The preferred technique in our regional oncology unit is curettage 
of the tumour and plating, augmented with cement to fill the defect and restore 
the structural morphology. In this case series we evaluate the survivorship of 
the construct and the clinical outcomes in patients who had an established or 
prospective pathological humeral fracture treated with curettage and cement 
augmented plating, since 2010. We identified 19 patients; 17 had metastasis and 
2 myeloma of whom 15 had established fractures and four impending. The mean age 
at surgery was 69 years (51-86), and mean time since surgery 3.2 years. Overall 
mean follow up time was 20 months with 14 patients deceased and 5 surviving. 
There was 100% survivorship of the construct with no mechanical failures and no 
re-operations. There were no post-operative wound complications. Excellent early 
pain control was achieved in 18 patients with one experiencing pain controlled 
by analgesia. Function was assessed using Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) 
and was satisfactory; mean 79/100 (range 72-85). Cement augmented plating for 
pathological humerus fractures is a suitable alternative to intramedullary 
nailing and addresses several of the concerns with that technique. It provides 
immediate rigidity and allows early unrestricted function.

BACKGROUND: Obesity threatens to undo the improvements that have been made in 
life expectancy over the last two centuries. It disproportionately affects lower 
socioeconomic and ethnic minority groups and has become one of the most 
important global health challenges of the 21stcentury. Whilst obesity is not 
confined to city populations, cities are home to more than half of the world's 
population with concentrated groups at high risk of obesity. Cities have also 
long been the forefront of social and technological change that has led to our 
current obesogenic environment. The aim of this study was to systematically 
identify city-wide interventions to address obesity, from which recommendations 
for policy makers, health system leaders and political leaders in cities could 
be made.
METHODS: Systematic review, conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, examining 
Embase, Ovid Medline, Central, Scopus, Campbell Library, CINALH, Health Business 
Elite; Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), PyschINFO and Prospero. 
No restrictions on article type, date range or geographic location were applied. 
Along with classic academic sources, books and policy white papers were sought 
and reviewed. Studies that described a city-wide intervention to reduce obesity 
were included, irrespective of study design or perceived methodological quality. 
Only studies in English language were included. The primary outcome indicators 
that were sought and extracted were: reduction in obesity, reduction in weight 
and/or reduction in BMI. Where a primary outcome indicator was not stated, any 
other secondary impact measure was identified and recorded. This manuscript 
represents thematic analysis of a sub-set of data from the Prospero study, 
registration number: CRD42020166210.
FINDINGS: Our search yielded 42,137 original citations of which 1614 met the 
inclusion criteria and 96 were coded as relating to obesity. The 96 citations, 
ranging in year of publication 1997 to 2019, were conducted in 36 cities, with 
13 citations either not stating a city or covering multiple cities, across 5 
continents. The highest proportion of publications were from North America (59 / 
96) and in particular the USA (56/96) and New York City (23/96). Primary outcome 
indicators were only stated in one quarter of the identified studies (24/96). 
Overall, there was heterogeneity of study design, descriptive methodologies and 
publication types, with a majority being descriptive texts using qualitative 
instruments of assessment.
INTERPRETATION: Multi-level and multi-component interventions, at the 
individual, community and city level, done in concert, are needed to address 
obesity. A composite of interventions that cities can utilise to address obesity 
is provided. These interventions will also be beneficial to the environment and 
make the case that personal health and planetary health are inextricably linked 
and should be considered as one.
FUNDING: None.

Diffuse bilateral uveal melanocytic proliferation is a rare paraneoplastic 
ophthalmologic syndrome. The increase in life expectancy in oncology partly 
explains the gradual increase in its incidence. In almost half of the cases, the 
syndrome manifests itself before the diagnosis of primary neoplasia. It should 
be suspected in cases of bilateral uveal pigmented lesions that do not meet the 
clinical criteria for other known eye pathologies. Legal blindness occurs for 
the majority of patients during the first year after the initial clinical 
presentation. Death, due to the severity of the underlying pathology, occurs 
statistically within three years. Here we display the case of such a diffuse 
bilateral uveal melanocytic proliferation in a patient with relapsed colonic 
adenocarcinoma, initially treated for age-related macular degeneration.

Publisher: La prolifération mélanocytique uvéale bilatérale diffuse est un 
syndrome paranéoplasique ophtalmologique rare. L’augmentation de l’espérance de 
vie en oncologie explique, en partie, la majoration progressive de son 
incidence. Dans près de la moitié des cas, le syndrome se manifeste 
antérieurement au diagnostic de la néoplasie primaire. Il doit être suspecté en 
cas de lésions pigmentées uvéales bilatérales ne répondant pas aux critères 
cliniques d’autres pathologies oculaires connues. La cécité légale s’établit 
chez la majorité des patients durant la première année suivant la présentation 
clinique initiale. Un décès, dû à la sévérité de la pathologie sous-jacente, 
survient presque toujours dans les trois ans. Nous rapportons ici le cas d’une 
telle prolifération mélanocytique uvéale bilatérale diffuse, chez une patiente 
atteinte d’un adénocarcinome colique en rechute, traitée initialement pour une 
dégénérescence maculaire liée à l’âge.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab in combination with 
carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for 
first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.Methods: A Markov model was 
developed based on the IMpower130 clinical trial. Drug costs and health state 
utility were obtained from the literature. Outcomes included life-years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty.Results: When compared to 
chemotherapy alone, atezolizumab plus chemotherapy provides an additional 0.34 
LY and 0.19 QALY, and has an ICER of $180,560.15 per additional LY gained and 
that of $325,328.71 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the 
results were most sensitive to changes in atezolizumab cost. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that there was a 0% probability that atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy was cost-effective at willingness-to-pay values of $30,828 per 
QALY. If the WTP threshold increased to $325,000 per QALY, atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy has a 50% chance to be cost-effective.Conclusions: From the Chinese 
healthcare system perspective, atezolizumab combination is not cost-effective 
for first-line therapy of advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Despite reported increases in referral numbers, a large proportion 
of those with prediabetes still decline participation in the NHS England 
Diabetes Prevention Programme (NDPP). The aim of this study was to explore 
whether investment in interventions to improve uptake of the programme has the 
potential to be cost-effective.
METHODS: An early cost-utility analysis was conducted using a Markov model 
parameterized based on secondary data sources. We explored different uptake 
scenarios and the impact that this had on the maximum allowable intervention 
price based on cost-effectiveness at the UK NICE willingness to pay threshold of 
£20,000 (US$ 25,913). Value of information analyses were conducted to explore 
the potential value of further research to resolve uncertainty at each uptake 
level.
RESULTS: As uptake levels increase, the maximum allowable intervention price and 
overall expected value of removing decision uncertainty increases. For 5 
percentage and 50 percentage points increase in uptake levels, the maximum 
allowable intervention price is £41.86 (US$ 54.23) and £418.59 (US$ 542.34) per 
person, and the overall expected value of removing decision uncertainty are 
£361,818,839 (US$ 468,786,625) and £1,468,712,316 (US$ 1,902,921,063) 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: There is headroom for investment in interventions that improve 
uptake to the NDPP, thereby allowing the programme itself to be delivered in a 
manner that remains cost-effective.

Background and aim of the work European COVID-19 statistics showed 
differentiation between mortality and new cases. Some studies suggested several 
factors including migration, cancer incidence, life expectancy and health system 
capacity maybe associated with differentiations. Up to now, impact of those 
factors in different European societies is not discussed and compared. Aim of 
the present study was to perform the cluster analysis in European countries in 
attention to clinical and epidemiological factors due to covid-19. Methods We 
collected some appropriate extreme data of COVID-19 to access the situations by 
ANOVA post-hoc test in 3 scenarios, as well as to estimate regression 
coefficients in simple linear regression, and a cluster analysis using average 
linkage. Covid-19 Statistics were considered in all analyses until April 24, 
2020. Results Among 39 European countries, several countries reported highest 
rate of confirmed cases included of Italy (current statues=2270.52) and Spain 
(current status=2616.24). The highest rate of mortality was seen in France 
(current status=242.16), Italy (current status=305.52). Life expectancy (female) 
(P=0.01, 95%Cl=1521.27,15264.58), migration (P<0.001, 95%Cl=41.42,96.72) had 
significant association with confirmed cases and death. Overall cancer death 
(P<0.001, 95%Cl=0.36,0.68; P<0.001, 95%Cl=0.01,0.07) and lung cancer death 
(P<0.001, 95%Cl=1.97,3.56; P<0.001, 95%Cl=0.09,0.37) associated with confirmed 
cases and mortality, too. We were also determined 5 clusters which more than 30 
countries were categorized in the first cluster. Conclusions Demographic 
factors, including population, life expectancy and migration, underlying 
disorders, such as several types of cancers, especially lung cancers lead to 
various distribution of COVID-19 in terms of prevalence and mortality, across 
European counties.

The Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative, founded in 2003, was responsible for 
changing the access profile in the United States, increasing the prevalence of 
arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) by 50% and reducing that of arteriovenous grafts 
(AVGs). However, the concept that AVFs are always the best access for all 
patients has been challenged. Discussion points are: (1) the questionable 
survival benefit of AVFs over AVGs, if one takes into account the high rates of 
primary AVF failure; (2) the potential benefits of using AVGs for greater 
primary success; and (3) the questionable benefit of AVFs over AVGs in patients 
with shorter survival, such as the elderly. The high rate of primary failure and 
maturation procedures leads to prolonged use of catheters, and it is one of the 
weaknesses of the fistula first strategy. AVGs proved to be better than AVFs as 
a second access after the failure of a first AVF, and in patients with non-ideal 
vessels, with greater primary success and reduced catheter times. AVGs appear to 
have a similar survival to AVFs in patients older than 80 years, with less 
primary failures and interventions to promote maturation. The most recent KDOQUI 
guidelines suggest an individualized approach in access planning, taking into 
account life expectancy, comorbidities and individual vascular characteristics, 
with the aim of chosing adequate access for the right patient, at the right 
time, for the right reasons.

A Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative, fundada em 2003, foi responsável pela 
mudança do perfil dos acessos nos Estados Unidos, aumentando em 50% a 
prevalência das fístulas arteriovenosas (FAVs) e reduzindo a de enxertos 
arteriovenosos (EAVs). No entanto, o conceito de que as FAVs são sempre o melhor 
acesso para todos os pacientes vem sofrendo questionamentos. São pontos de 
discussão: (1) o questionável benefício de sobrevida das FAVs sobre os EAVs, se 
levadas em conta as altas taxas de falência primária das FAVs; (2) os potenciais 
benefícios no uso de EAVs pelo maior sucesso primário; e (3) o benefício 
questionável das FAVs sobre os EAVs em pacientes com menor sobrevida, como os 
idosos. A alta taxa de falência primária e de procedimentos para maturação leva 
ao uso prolongado de cateteres e é um dos pontos fracos da estratégia "Fistula 
First". Os EAVs mostraram superioridade em relação às FAVs como segundo acesso 
após a falência de uma primeira FAV e em pacientes com vasos não ideais, com 
maior sucesso primário e redução dos tempos de cateter. Os EAVs parecem ter 
sobrevida semelhante à das FAVs nos idosos acima de 80 anos, com menos falências 
primárias e intervenções para maturação. As diretrizes mais recentes do KDOQUI 
sugerem uma abordagem individualizada no planejamento dos acessos, levando-se em 
conta expectativa de vida, comorbidades e características vasculares 
individuais, com o objetivo de indicar acesso adequado para o paciente adequado, 
no tempo adequado, pelos motivos adequados.

Millions of Americans experience pain daily. In 2017, opioid overdose claimed 
64,000 lives increasing to 84,000 lives in 2020, resulting in a decrease in 
national life expectancy. Chronic opioid use results in dependency, drug 
tolerance, neuroadaptation, hyperalgesia, potential addictive behaviors, or 
Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) caused by a hypodopaminergia. Evaluation of 
pain clinic patients with the Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS) test and the 
Addiction Severity Index (ASI- Media Version V) revealed that GARS scores equal 
to or greater than 4 and 7 alleles significantly predicted drug and alcohol 
severity, respectively. We utilized RT-PCR for SNP genotyping and multiplex 
PCR/capillary electrophoresis for fragment analysis of the role of eleven 
alleles in a ten-reward gene panel, reflecting the activity of brain reward 
circuitry in 121 chronic opioid users. The study consisted of 55 males and 66 
females averaging ages 54 and 53 years of age, respectively. The patients 
included Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. Inclusion 
criteria mandated that the Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) was 30-600 mg/day 
(males) and 20 to 180 mg/day (females) for treatment of chronic pain over 12 
months. Ninety-six percent carried four or more risk alleles, and 73% carried 
seven or more risk alleles, suggesting a high predictive risk for opioid and 
alcohol dependence, respectively. These data indicate that chronic, legally 
prescribed opioid users attending a pain clinic possess high genetic risk for 
drug and alcohol addiction. Early identification of genetic risk, using the GARS 
test upon entry to treatment, may prevent iatrogenic induced opioid dependence.

A consequentialist argument for considering age in triage decisions during the 
coronavirus pandemic.

Altman MC(1).

Ellensburg, Washington.

Most ethics guidelines for distributing scarce medical resources during the 
coronavirus pandemic seek to save the most lives and the most life-years. A 
patient's prognosis is determined using a SOFA or MSOFA score to measure 
likelihood of survival to discharge, as well as a consideration of relevant 
comorbidities and their effects on likelihood of survival up to one or five 
years. Although some guidelines use age as a tiebreaker when two patients' 
prognoses are identical, others refuse to consider age for fear of 
discriminating against the elderly. In this paper, I argue that age is directly 
relevant for maximizing health benefits, so current ethics guidelines are 
wrongly excluding or deemphasizing life-stage in their triage algorithms. 
Research on COVID-19 has shown that age is a risk factor in adverse outcomes, 
independent of comorbidities. And limiting a consideration of life-years to only 
one or five years past discharge does not maximize health benefits. Therefore, 
based on their own stated values, triage algorithms for coronavirus patients 
ought to include life-stage as a primary consideration, along with the SOFA 
score and comorbidities, rather than excluding it or using it merely as a 
tiebreaker. This is not discriminatory because patients ought to have equal 
opportunity to experience life-stages. The equitable enforcement of that right 
justifies unequal treatment based on age in cases when there is a scarcity of 
life-saving resources. A consideration of life-stage would thus allow healthcare 
workers to responsibly steward public resources in order to maximize lives and 
life-years saved.
