BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision 
loss and blindness in Canada. Eye examinations play an important role in early 
detection. However, DR screening by optometrists is not always universally 
covered by public or private health insurance plans. This study assessed whether 
expanding public health coverage to include diabetic eye examinations for 
retinopathy by optometrists is cost-effective from the perspective of the health 
care system.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis of extended coverage for diabetic 
eye examinations in Prince Edward Island to include examinations by 
optometrists, not currently publicly covered. We used a Markov chain to simulate 
disease burden based on eye examination rates and DR progression over a 30-year 
time horizon. Results were presented as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained. A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Extending public health coverage to eye examinations by optometrists 
was associated with higher costs ($9,908,543.32) and improved QALYs 
(156,862.44), over 30 years, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $1668.43/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most 
influential determinants of the results were the cost of optometric screening 
and selected utility scores. At the commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY, the 
probability that the new policy was cost-effective was 99.99%.
CONCLUSIONS: Extending public health coverage to eye examinations by 
optometrists is cost-effective based on a commonly used threshold of 
$50,000/QALY. Findings from this study can inform the decision to expand 
public-insured optometric services for patients with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: In 2014, Austrian health authorities implemented an organized breast 
cancer screening program. Until then, there has been a long-standing tradition 
of opportunistic screening.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of organized screening compared 
with opportunistic screening, as well as to identify factors influencing the 
clinical and economic outcomes.
METHODS: We developed and validated an individual-level state-transition model 
and assessed the health outcomes and costs of organized and opportunistic 
screening for 40-year-old asymptomatic women. The base-case analysis compared a 
scenario involving organized biennial screening with a scenario reflecting 
opportunistic screening practice for an average-risk woman aged 45 to 69 years. 
We applied an annual discount rate of 3% and estimated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of the cost (2012 euros) per life-year gained 
(LYG) from a health care perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared with opportunistic screening, an organized program yielded on 
average additional 0.0118 undiscounted life-years (i.e., 4.3 days) and cost 
savings of €41 per woman. In the base-case analysis, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of organized screening was approximately €20,000 per 
LYG compared with no screening. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€50,000 per LYG, there was a 70% probability that organized screening would be 
considered cost-effective. The attendance rate, but not the test accuracy of 
mammography, was an influential factor for the cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: The decision to adopt organized screening is likely an efficient 
use of limited health care resources in Austria.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
pembrolizumab in treating patients with ipilimumab-naïve advanced melanoma in 
Portugal.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to analyze the costs and 
consequences of treatment with pembrolizumab compared to treatment with 
ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma not previously treated with 
ipilimumab. The model was parameterized by using data from a head-to-head phase 
III randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-006. Extrapolation of long-term outcomes 
was based on approaches previously applied, combining ipilimumab data and 
melanoma patients' registry data. The analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service, and a lifetime horizon 
(40 years) was used. Portugal-specific disease management costs were estimated 
by convening a panel of six clinical experts to derive health state resource use 
and multiplying the results by national unit costs. To test for the robustness 
of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Pembrolizumab increases life expectancy in 1.57 undiscounted life-years 
(LYs) and is associated with an increase in costs versus that of ipilimumab. The 
estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is €47,221 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) and €42,956 per LY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed 
that the results were robust to the change of most input values or assumptions 
and were sensitive to time on treatment scenarios. According to the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed, pembrolizumab is associated with a 
cost per QALY gained inferior to €50,000 in 75% of the cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the usually accepted thresholds in oncology, 
pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative for treating patients with 
advanced melanoma in Portugal.

BACKGROUND: Partially implantable active middle ear implants (aMEIs) offer a 
solution for individuals who have mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss and 
an outer ear medical condition that precludes the use of hearing aids. When 
otherwise left untreated, individuals report a lower quality of life, which may 
further decrease with increasing disability. In the lack of cost-effectiveness 
studies and long-term data, there is a need for decision modeling.
OBJECTIVE: To explore individual-level variance in resource utilization patterns 
following aMEI implantation.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed and analyzed as microsimulation to 
estimate the incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of partially implantable 
aMEIs compared with no (surgical) intervention in individuals with sensorineural 
hearing loss and an outer ear medical condition in Australia. Cost data were 
derived mostly from the Medicare Benefit Schedule and effectiveness data from 
published literature. A third-party payer perspective was adopted, and a 5% 
discount rate was applied over a 10-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Compared with baseline strategy, aMEIs yielded an incremental cost of 
Australian dollars (AUD) 13,339.18, incremental quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) of 1.35, and an ICUR of AUD 9,913.72/QALY. Of the respective number of 
simulated patients who visited each health state, 75.73% never had a minor 
adverse event, 99.82% did not experience device failure, and 97.75% did not 
cease to use their aMEIs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed the ICUR to 
differ by only 0.95%.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Australian setting, partially implantable aMEIs offer a safe 
and cost-effective solution compared with no intervention and are also well 
accepted by users.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the incremental costs and consequences of stratified 
national breast screening programs (stratified NBSPs) and drivers of relative 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model (discrete event simulation) was 
conceptualized to represent four stratified NBSPs (risk 1, risk 2, masking 
[supplemental screening for women with higher breast density], and masking and 
risk 1) compared with the current UK NBSP and no screening. The model assumed a 
lifetime horizon, the health service perspective to identify costs (£, 2015), 
and measured consequences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Multiple data 
sources were used: systematic reviews of effectiveness and utility, published 
studies reporting costs, and cohort studies embedded in existing NBSPs. Model 
parameter uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 
one-way sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis, supported by probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, suggested that the risk stratified NBSPs (risk 1 and risk-2) were 
relatively cost-effective when compared with the current UK NBSP, with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £16,689 per QALY and £23,924 per QALY, 
respectively. Stratified NBSP including masking approaches (supplemental 
screening for women with higher breast density) was not a cost-effective 
alternative, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £212,947 per QALY 
(masking) and £75,254 per QALY (risk 1 and masking). When compared with no 
screening, all stratified NBSPs could be considered cost-effective. Key drivers 
of cost-effectiveness were discount rate, natural history model parameters, 
mammographic sensitivity, and biopsy rates for recalled cases. A key assumption 
was that the risk model used in the stratification process was perfectly 
calibrated to the population.
CONCLUSIONS: This early model-based cost-effectiveness analysis provides 
indicative evidence for decision makers to understand the key drivers of costs 
and QALYs for exemplar stratified NBSP.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir 
(EBR/GZR) regimens compared with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir ± ribavirin (3D ± RBV), and 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 
(GT) 1 infection.
METHODS: A Markov cohort state-transition model was constructed to evaluate the 
cost-utility of EBR/GZR ± RBV over a lifetime time horizon from the payer 
perspective. The target population was patients infected with chronic hepatitis 
C GT1 subtypes a or b (GT1a or GT1b), stratified by treatment history 
(treatment-naive [TN] or treatment-experienced), presence of cirrhosis, baseline 
hepatitis C virus RNA (< or ≥6 million IU/mL), and presence of NS5A 
resistance-associated variants. The primary outcome was incremental cost-utility 
ratio for EBR/GZR ± RBV versus available oral direct-acting antiviral agents. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the model.
RESULTS: EBR/GZR ± RBV was economically dominant versus LDV/SOF in all patient 
populations. EBR/GZR ± RBV was also less costly than SOF/VEL and 3D ± RBV, but 
produced fewer quality-adjusted life-years in select populations. In the 
remaining populations, EBR/GZR ± RBV was economically dominant. One-way 
sensitivity analyses showed varying sustained virologic response rates across 
EBR/GZR ± RBV regimens, commonly impacted model conclusions when lower bound 
values were inserted, and at the upper bound resulted in dominance over SOF/VEL 
in GT1a cirrhotic and GT1b TN noncirrhotic patients. Results of the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that EBR/GZR ± RBV was cost-effective 
in more than 99% of iterations in GT1a and GT1b noncirrhotic patients and more 
than 69% of iterations in GT1b cirrhotic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other oral direct-acting antiviral agents, EBR/GZR ± 
RBV was the economically dominant regimen for treating GT1a noncirrhotic and 
GT1b TN cirrhotic patients, and was cost saving in all other populations.

BACKGROUND: One major challenge in prioritizing health care using 
cost-effectiveness (CE) information is when alternatives are more expensive but 
more effective than existing technology. In such a situation, an external 
criterion in the form of a CE threshold that reflects the willingness to pay 
(WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year is necessary.
OBJECTIVES: To determine a CE threshold for health care interventions in 
Malaysia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, contingent valuation study was conducted using a 
stratified multistage cluster random sampling technique in four states in 
Malaysia. One thousand thirteen respondents were interviewed in person for their 
socioeconomic background, quality of life, and WTP for a hypothetical scenario.
RESULTS: The CE thresholds established using the nonparametric Turnbull method 
ranged from MYR12,810 to MYR22,840 (~US $4,000-US $7,000), whereas those 
estimated with the parametric interval regression model were between MYR19,929 
and MYR28,470 (~US $6,200-US $8,900). Key factors that affected the CE 
thresholds were education level, estimated monthly household income, and the 
description of health state scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is no single WTP value for a 
quality-adjusted life-year. The CE threshold estimated for Malaysia was found to 
be lower than the threshold value recommended by the World Health Organization.

BACKGROUND: A broad literature on health state utility values exists, but 
compared with chronic health states (HSs), issues surrounding the valuation of 
temporary health states (THSs) have been poorly explored.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the methods used by previous studies to value HSs that are 
considered temporary so as to determine the strengths and limitations associated 
with various approaches and to inform future study designs.
METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken to explore the methods used, assess 
how the valuation was conducted for diseases that might lead to HSs deemed as 
temporary, and identify the challenges encountered in the valuation of THSs.
RESULTS: Of the 36 relevant studies, 22 were explicit that the HS being valued 
was temporary. Most of the studies used more than one technique (often 
incorporating both conventional and adapted approaches). In using adapted 
techniques, the primary challenge was identifying an appropriate intermediate 
"anchor" HS and the possibility of negative utilities.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no agreement on the most methodologically robust approach 
to THS valuation. Valuation is complex and important issues relating to the 
validity, practicality, and reliability of the techniques used were not 
adequately covered by most of the studies identified.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence signals the need for effective forms of home support 
to people with dementia and their carers. The cost-effectiveness evidence of 
different approaches to support is scant.
OBJECTIVES: To appraise economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of home 
support interventions for dementia to inform future evaluation.
METHODS: A systematic literature review of full and partial economic evaluations 
was performed using the British National Health Service Economic Evaluation 
Database supplemented by additional references. Study characteristics and 
findings, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, when available, were 
summarized narratively. Study quality was appraised using the National Health 
Service Economic Evaluation Database critical appraisal criteria and independent 
ratings, agreed by two reviewers. Studies were located on a permutation matrix 
describing their mix of incremental costs/effects to aid decision making.
RESULTS: Of the 151 articles retrieved, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria: 8 
concerning support to people with dementia and 6 to carers. Five studies were 
incremental cost-utility analyses, seven were cost-effectiveness analyses, and 
two were cost consequences analyses. Five studies expressed incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios as cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(£6,696-£207,942 per quality-adjusted life-year). In four studies, interventions 
were dominant over usual care. Two interventions were more costly but more 
beneficial and were favorable against current acceptability thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational therapy, home-based exercise, and a carers' coping 
intervention emerged as cost-effective approaches for which there was better 
evidence. These interventions used environmental modifications, behavior 
management, physical activity, and emotional support as active components. More 
robust evidence is needed to judge the value of these and other interventions 
across the dementia care pathway.

BACKGROUND: Concerns about pathology testing such as the value provided by new 
tests and the potential for inappropriate utilization have led to a greater need 
to assess costs and benefits. Economic evaluations are a formal method of 
analyzing costs and benefits, yet for pathology tests, questions remain about 
the scope and quality of the economic evidence.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the extent and quality of published evidence provided by 
economic evaluations of pathology tests from 2010 to 2015.
METHODS: Economic evaluations relating to pathology tests from 2010 to 2015 were 
reviewed. Eight databases were searched for published studies, and details 
recorded for the country, clinical focus, type of testing, and consideration of 
sensitivity, specificity, and false test results. The reporting quality of 
studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
Standards checklist and cost-effectiveness ratios were analyzed for publication 
bias.
RESULTS: We found 356 economic evaluations of pathology tests, most of which 
regarded developed countries. The most common economic evaluations were 
cost-utility analyses and the most common clinical focus was infectious 
diseases. More than half of the studies considered sensitivity and specificity, 
but few studies considered the impact of false test results. The average 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist score was 
17 out of 24. Cost-utility ratios were commonly less than 
$10,000/quality-adjusted life-year or more than $200,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of economic evaluations of pathology tests has increased 
in recent years, but the rate of increase has plateaued. Furthermore, the 
quality of studies in the past 5 years was highly variable, and there is some 
question of publication bias in reporting cost-effectiveness ratios.

Heart transplantation in pediatric patients generally arises as a treatment 
option of last resort, that is, the indication is for patients with heart 
failure of various etiologies, with potential or actual end-organ dysfunction, 
in whom there are no reasonable, long-term options for life-prolonging therapy. 
The concept of heart failure is complex in a pediatric population, particularly 
those with congenital heart disease. While heart failure may refer simply to 
systolic dysfunction leading to low cardiac output, it can also encompass: 
diastolic dysfunction in restrictive cardiomyopathy; single ventricle physiology 
without an option for stable palliation. A good candidate should have a 
predicted life expectancy less than the median lifetime of a transplanted heart. 
Significant improvement in survival has been observed over time with 1- and 
5-year survival approximately 90% and 80% in the contemporary era.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of HIV-positive individuals receiving 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) is approaching that of HIV-negative people. 
However, little is known about how these populations compare in terms of 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We aimed to compare HRQoL between 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative people in Zambia and South Africa.
METHODS: As part of the HPTN 071 (PopART) study, data from adults aged 18-44 
years were gathered between Nov 28, 2013, and March 31, 2015, in large 
cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the general population in 21 
communities in Zambia and South Africa. HRQoL data were collected with a 
standardised generic measure of health across five domains. We used 
β-distributed multivariable models to analyse differences in HRQoL scores 
between HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals who were unaware of their 
status; aware, but not in HIV care; in HIV care, but who had not initiated ART; 
on ART for less than 5 years; and on ART for 5 years or more. We included 
controls for sociodemographic variables, herpes simplex virus type-2 status, and 
recreational drug use.
FINDINGS: We obtained data for 19 750 respondents in Zambia and 18 941 
respondents in South Africa. Laboratory-confirmed HIV status was available for 
19 330 respondents in Zambia and 18 004 respondents in South Africa; 4128 (21%) 
of these 19 330 respondents in Zambia and 4012 (22%) of 18 004 respondents in 
South Africa had laboratory-confirmed HIV. We obtained complete HRQoL 
information for 19 637 respondents in Zambia and 18 429 respondents in South 
Africa. HRQoL scores did not differ significantly between individuals who had 
initiated ART more than 5 years previously and HIV-negative individuals, neither 
in Zambia (change in mean score -0·002, 95% CI -0·01 to 0·001; p=0·219) nor in 
South Africa (0·000, -0·002 to 0·003; p=0·939). However, scores did differ 
between HIV-positive individuals who had initiated ART less than 5 years 
previously and HIV-negative individuals in Zambia (-0·006, 95% CI -0·008 to 
-0·003; p<0·0001). A large proportion of people with clinically confirmed HIV 
were unaware of being HIV-positive (1768 [43%] of 4128 people in Zambia and 2026 
[50%] of 4012 people in South Africa) and reported good HRQoL, with no 
significant differences from that of HIV-negative people (change in mean HRQoL 
score -0·001, 95% CI -0·003 to 0·001, p=0·216; and 0·001, -0·001 to 0·001, 
p=0·997, respectively). In South Africa, HRQoL scores were lower in HIV-positive 
individuals who were aware of their status but not enrolled in HIV care (change 
in mean HRQoL -0·004, 95% CI -0·01 to -0·001; p=0·010) and those in HIV care but 
not on ART (-0·008, -0·01 to -0·004; p=0·001) than in HIV-negative people, but 
the magnitudes of difference were small.
INTERPRETATION: ART is successful in helping to reduce inequalities in HRQoL 
between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in this general population 
sample. These findings highlight the importance of improving awareness of HIV 
status and expanding ART to prevent losses in HRQoL that occur with untreated 
HIV progression. The gains in HRQoL after individuals initiate ART could be 
substantial when scaled up to the population level.

AIM: In mammals, rewarding and aversive states are motivational drivers of 
behavioral expression. However, it is unclear whether such states affect 
neuronal functions at the level of individual neurons. In the present study, the 
neuronal effects of rewarding and aversive states were investigated in using 
PC12 mutant cells (PC12m3 cells) with low sensitivity to nerve growth factor.
MAIN METHODS: The intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and immobilization (IMM) 
methods were used to create rewarding and aversive states, respectively, in 
rats. Furthermore, experiments involving voluntary running on a wheel and forced 
running on a rotating rod were used to evaluate the effects of behavioral 
excitement on neurons. Then, the effects of plasma samples collected from the 
animals on neurite extension were examined microscopically, and p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity was assessed using Western 
blotting.
KEY FINDINGS: Plasma samples from the ICSS and IMM rats facilitated neurite 
outgrowth to different degrees. However, their effects were not influenced by 
behavioral excitement. Furthermore, the plasma from the ICSS rats also induced 
upregulated p38 MAPK activity, whereas that from the IMM rats produced the same 
or slightly lower levels of MAPK activity to the control plasma.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that rewarding and aversive states might 
cause morphological changes, such as neurite extension. As for the effects of 
these states on p38 MAPK activity, the former state might directly increase p38 
MAPK activity, but the latter state might have no effect or cause a slight 
reduction in p38 MAPK activity.

The primary aim of the present study was to determine the actual movement 
velocity of high-velocity, low-load (HVLL) and low-velocity, high-load (LVHL) 
resistance exercise in a group of older adults. The secondary aim was to examine 
the differences in velocities produced between male and females. In a crossover 
study design, four males (age: 67±3years) and five females (age: 68±2years) 
completed three sets of leg press, calf raise, leg curl, leg extension, chest 
press, seated row, bicep curl and tricep extension on six separate occasions 
(three HVLL and three LVHL sessions). The command "as fast as possible" was 
given for the concentric phase of HVLL, and 2s using a 60-bpm metronome 
controlled the concentric phase during LVHL. Participants had three days of 
recovery between each session, and a 7-day period before crossing over to the 
other protocol. Movement velocity was measured during the concentric and 
eccentric phases of resistance exercise using two-dimensional video analysis. 
The concentric phases for all exercises were significantly faster (P<0.001) 
during HVLL compared to LVHL. Furthermore, males produced significantly greater 
velocities than females during the concentric phase of the chest press, seated 
row, bicep curl, and tricep extension for both HVLL and LVHL (P<0.05). These 
protocols provide a simple solution for exercise professionals to ensure that 
older adults are training at desired velocities when carrying out resistance 
exercise, without the need for equipment that measures velocity.

This study aims to quantify the aggregate potential life-years (LYs) saved and 
healthcare cost-savings if the Healthy People 2020 objective were met to reduce 
invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence by 15%. We identified patients 
(n=886,380) diagnosed with invasive CRC between 2001 and 2011 from a nationally 
representative cancer dataset. We stratified these patients by sex, 
race/ethnicity, and age. Using these data and data from the 2001-2011 U.S. life 
tables, we estimated a survival function for each CRC group and the 
corresponding reference group and computed per-person LYs saved. We estimated 
per-person annual healthcare cost-savings using the 2008-2012 Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey. We calculated aggregate LYs saved and cost-savings by 
multiplying the reduced number of CRC patients by the per-person LYs saved and 
lifetime healthcare cost-savings, respectively. We estimated an aggregate of 
84,569 and 64,924 LYs saved for men and women, respectively, accounting for 
healthcare cost-savings of $329.3 and $294.2 million (in 2013$), respectively. 
Per person, we estimated 6.3 potential LYs saved related to those who developed 
CRC for both men and women, and healthcare cost-savings of $24,000 for men and 
$28,000 for women. Non-Hispanic whites and those aged 60-64 had the highest 
aggregate potential LYs saved and cost-savings. Achieving the HP2020 objective 
of reducing invasive CRC incidence by 15% by year 2020 would potentially save 
nearly 150,000 life-years and $624 million on healthcare costs.

Anticoagulation is a vital therapy in a number of different disease processes, 
and is strongly recommended for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
fibrillation and/or with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Studies involving 
patients on oral anticoagulants (OACs) have revealed that ICH can occur eight 
times more frequently in this population, with an annual estimated incidence of 
0.25 to 1.1%. The decision of whether and when to resume anticoagulation 
following intracranial hemorrhage is challenging and requires an assessment of 
associated risks and benefits. Clinical data, imaging, and risk factors for both 
ischemic and hemorrhagic complications may aid in decision-making. Baseline 
functional status, life expectancy, compliance with therapy, and family support 
also impact decision analyses. Currently available data suggest that 
anticoagulation could be safely restarted in select groups of OAC-ICH patients 
within 4 weeks of intracranial hemorrhage; however, high-quality randomized, 
clinical trials are needed.

OBJECTIVE: To provide perspective for the National Health Insurance Bureau 
(NHIB), we determined the cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab combined with 
trastuzumab and docetaxel (TDP) versus trastuzumab and docetaxel (TD) as a 
first-line treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to simulate cost-effectiveness, disease 
progression, and survival, based on clinical data and transition probabilities 
extracted from the CLEOPATRA study. Direct medical costs were acquired from the 
NHIB claims database.The utilities in health state were based on a recent 
cost-effectiveness study on trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in New Taiwan dollars (NT$), and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed one-way deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of specific 
parameters on the model.
RESULTS: Modeled median survival was 39.1 months for TD and 50.1 months for TDP. 
The ICER was NT$18,999,687 (US$593,741) per QALY gained. The sensitivity 
analyses indicated that TDP could be cost-effective under favorable assumptions; 
TDP had a 68% chance of being cost-effective, if TDP costs could be reduced with 
10% in the stable disease state.
CONCLUSION: Our model predicted that TDP would be cost-effective as a first-line 
treatment for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer, but only under favorable 
drug cost assumptions.

The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13266634 in human zinc 
transporter 8, ZnT8 (SLC30A8), leads to a R325 variant, which is associated with 
an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Although the molecular 
details remain unknown, the mutation is thought to alter the kinetics of zinc 
transport into insulin granules in pancreatic β-cells. Nevertheless, analysis of 
ZnT8 sequences from several animals shows that the amino acid at position 325 is 
poorly conserved. Apart from this particular SNP, human ZnT8 also has two 
isoforms (splice variants) that differ in length regarding a 49 amino acid 
N-terminal extension. When expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, 
the long isoform was present in the plasma membrane in addition to internal 
membranes, whereas the short isoform was localized mostly to internal membranes. 
Our observation that human ZnT8 variants and isoforms expressed in Xenopus 
laevis oocytes are all localized at the cell surface allowed us to develop a 
zinc transport assay using the radioactive isotope 65Zn. We found no detectable 
differences in zinc transport between W and R variants and no statistically 
significant differences between long and short isoforms of the W325 variant. Our 
findings of differential cytolocation of ZnT8 isoforms could be relevant for 
β-cell zinc metabolism in health and disease.

INTRODUCTION: To assess whether an enhanced role for radiographers in reporting 
lung cancer chest radiographs is cost-effective.
METHODS: Costs and outcomes of chest radiograph reporting by reporting 
radiographer or by a radiologist were compared using a decision tree model. The 
model followed patients from an initial chest radiographs for suspected lung 
cancer to the provision of cancer care in positive cases. Sensitivity and 
specificity of reporting for radiographers and radiologists were derived from a 
recent trial. Treatment costs and quality adjusted life expectancy were 
estimated over five years for those diagnosed. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of inference to parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: For 1000 simulated patients, radiographer reporting decreased detection 
costs by £8500 and detected 10.3 more cases at initial presentation. After 
including treatment costs and outcomes, radiographer reporting remained cheaper 
than radiologist reporting and resulted in 1.4 additional QALYs per 1000 
screened patients. Probabilistic analysis indicated a 98% likelihood that 
radiographer reporting is cheaper and more effective than radiologist reporting 
after inclusion of treatment costs and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Radiographer reporting is a cost-effective alternative to 
radiologist reporting in lung cancer diagnosis. Further work is needed to 
support the adoption of radiographer's reporting pathway in diagnosis of lung 
cancer suspected patients.

Although improved long-term outcomes obtained with the use of arterial grafts 
for coronary revascularization in comparison with the traditional association of 
a single arterial and saphenous vein grafts have been demonstrated in the 
overall population, the efficacy of this newer technique in the elderly is 
difficult to prove because their shorter life expectancy due to advanced heart 
disease, associated with severe comorbidities. Moreover, more widespread use of
