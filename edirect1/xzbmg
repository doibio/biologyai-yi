Factors associated with overall survival prostate cancer in Florida: a 
multilevel analysis.

Xiao H, Tan F, Adunlin G, Ali AA, Goovaerts P, Gwede CK, Huang Y.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate individual and contextual factors contributing to 
overall prostate cancer (PCa) survival in Florida.
METHODS: A random sample of 6,457 PCa cases diagnosed between 10/1/2001 and 
12/31/2007 was extracted from Florida Cancer Data System. Comorbidity was 
computed following Elixhauser Index. Survival probability curve was generated 
using Kaplan-Meier method. The Wei, Lin, and Weissfel model was used for the 
multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Older age at diagnosis was associated with shorter time to death. 
Current smokers had a higher hazard rate than non-current smokers. Higher hazard 
of overall mortality was associated with being diagnosed with advanced stage 
compared with localized stage and having poorly-differentiated tumor compared 
with well-moderately differentiated tumor. No definitive treatment, radiation 
alone, and hormone alone were significantly associated with elevated hazard rate 
compared with surgery. Fifteen comorbidities were significantly associated with 
shorter time-to-death.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective control of comorbidity in PCa patients should help 
improve life expectancy and lead to prolonged survival.

Update on paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: on the long way to understand 
the principles of the disease.

University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

The understanding of the clinical manifestations in paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (PNH) has made great progress. The main symptoms of this disease 
such as abdominal pain, renal failure or pulmonary hypertension and even the 
basis of the dramatic thrombophilia can be related to intravascular haemolysis 
and liberation of free haemoglobin resulting in NO depletion. In addition, there 
has been a recent great progress in elucidating the pathophysiology of clonal 
expansion within PNH bone marrow. In the majority of patients with haemolytic 
PNH, there are additional mutations within genes beyond PIG-A and rather 
affecting growth and differentiation of clonal bone marrow cells. In contrast to 
the formerly proposed single mechanism hypotheses such as immune selection or 
intrinsic gain of clonal dominance, this appears to follow a pattern of a 
complex clonal hierarchy putatively integrating both earlier anticipated 
mechanisms. Treatment of PNH is mainly supportive. The only curative approach as 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation should only be applied to patients with 
complications such as secondary bone marrow aplasia or transformation into MDS 
or AML. Symptomatic haemolytic PNH will be treated with eculizumab, an inhibitor 
of the terminal complement cascade. Treatment with eculizumab can significantly 
prevent PNH-related symptoms including the abnormal thrombophilia. Recently, it 
was demonstrated that in contrast to untreated historic PNH patients, meanwhile 
a normal life expectancy is observed in eculizumab-treated patients. The 
recently approved vaccine against meningococci type B by the European Medical 
Agency (EMA) could probably further help to prevent meningococcal sepsis due to 
the induced complement deficiency by eculizumab.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the relationship between family caregivers' 
mental health and postoperative recovery for elderly patients with hip fracture 
in Taiwan.
METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial with 12-month follow-up on 276 family caregiver-patient dyads. Categories 
of caregiver mental-health trajectory groups were identified by latent-class 
finite-mixture modeling. Differences in these groups were explored using the 
generalized estimating equation approach for effects on patients' postoperative 
recovery, including pain intensity, range of motion, maximum muscle strength, 
recovery of self-care ability, mobility, re-hospitalization, and health-related 
quality of life.
RESULTS: The patterns of family caregivers' mental health best fit a three-group 
trajectory model (poor, moderate, and good). Compared to patients with 
caregivers in the "poor" mental health group, patients with caregivers in the 
"good" group had better trajectories in physical functional recovery, including 
mobility, muscle strength, hip flexion and extension, and ankle extension. These 
patients were also less likely to be hospitalized, experienced less pain, and 
had better physical and mental health. Patients with caregivers in the 
"moderate" group likewise performed better than those in the "poor" group.
CONCLUSION: During the first year following discharge, postoperative recovery of 
patients after hip fracture was associated with their family caregivers' mental 
health. When a family caregiver's mental health was "poor," the patient 
recovering after hip-fracture surgery was more likely to recover poorly. These 
results suggest that health care providers could consider family caregivers' 
mental well-being while estimating recovery times and health outcomes of 
patients following hip fracture.

INTRODUCTION: Medicare coverage recently was expanded to include intensive 
behavioral therapy for obese individuals in primary care settings.
PURPOSE: To examine the potential cost effectiveness of Medicare's intensive 
behavioral therapy for obesity, accounting for uncertainty in effectiveness and 
utilization.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model of type 2 diabetes was used to estimate 
long-term health benefits and healthcare system costs of intensive behavioral 
therapy for obesity in the Medicare population without diabetes relative to an 
alternative of usual care. Cohort statistics were based on the 2005-2008 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Model parameters were derived 
from the literature. Analyses were conducted in 2014 and reported in 2012 U.S. 
dollars.
RESULTS: Based on assumptions for the maximal intervention effectiveness, 
intensive behavioral therapy is likely to be cost saving if costs per session 
equal the current reimbursement rate ($25.19) and will provide a 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,912 per quality-adjusted life-year if costs 
equal the rate for routine office visits. The intervention is less cost 
effective if it is less effective in primary care settings or if fewer 
intervention sessions are supplied by providers or used by participants.
CONCLUSIONS: If the effectiveness of the intervention is similar to lifestyle 
interventions tested in other settings and costs per session equal the current 
reimbursement rate, intensive behavioral therapy for obesity offers good value. 
However, intervention effectiveness and the pattern of implementation and 
utilization strongly influence cost effectiveness. Given uncertainty regarding 
these factors, additional data might be collected to validate the modeling 
results.

Estimation of the variance effective population size in age structured 
populations.

The variance effective population size for age structured populations is 
generally hard to estimate and the temporal method often gives biased estimates. 
Here, we give an explicit expression for a correction factor which, combined 
with estimates from the temporal method, yield approximately unbiased estimates. 
The calculation of the correction factor requires knowledge of the age specific 
offspring distribution and survival probabilities as well as possible 
correlation between survival and reproductive success. In order to relax these 
requirements, we show that only first order moments of these distributions need 
to be known if the time between samples is large, or individuals from all age 
classes which reproduce are sampled. A very explicit approximate expression for 
the asymptotic coefficient of standard deviation of the estimator is derived, 
and it can be used to construct confidence intervals and optimal ways of 
weighting information from different markers. The asymptotic coefficient of 
standard deviation can also be used to design studies and we show that in order 
to maximize the precision for a given sample size, individuals from older age 
classes should be sampled since their expected variance of allele frequency 
change is higher and easier to estimate. However, for populations with 
fluctuating age class sizes, the accuracy of the method is reduced when samples 
are taken from older age classes with high demographic variation. We also 
present a method for simultaneous estimation of the variance effective and 
census population size.

BACKGROUND: Older people who have been recently discharged from hospital are at 
increased risk of falls and deterioration in physical functioning.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a 12-month home-exercise 
program for older adults after hospitalization.
METHOD: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled 
trial. The analysis was conducted from the health and community service provider 
perspective. A total of 340 people aged 60 years and older, with a recent 
hospital admission, were randomized into exercise and usual care control groups. 
Incremental costs per extra person showing improvement in mobility performance 
(using the Short Physical Performance Battery), per person indicating 
improvement in health (self-reported using a 3-point Likert scale) and per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (utility measured using the EQ-5D) were 
estimated. Uncertainty was represented using cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves. Subgroup analyses for participants with better cognition (above the 
median MMSE score of 28) also were undertaken.
RESULTS: The average cost of the intervention was $A751 per participant. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness of the program relative to usual care was 
$A22,958 per extra person showing an improvement in mobility, $A19,020 per extra 
person indicating an improvement in health, and $A77,403 per QALY. The 
acceptability curve demonstrates that the intervention had an 80% probability of 
being cost-effective relative to the control at a threshold of $A48,000 per 
extra person achieving mobility improvement and $A36,000 indicating an 
improvement in self-reported health. There was no threshold value at which the 
program can be considered as having an 80% probability of cost-effectiveness for 
the QALY outcome. Subgroup analyses for participants with better cognitive 
status indicated improved cost-effectiveness for all outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The exercise intervention appeared to offer reasonable value for 
money for mobility outcomes and self-reported health status. Value for money for 
all measures was greater in the higher cognitive status subgroup.

Treatment of hemophilia in the near future.

Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Pathophysiology and

Advancements and debacles have characterized hemophilia treatment over the past 
50 years. The 1970s saw the availability of plasma-derived concentrates making 
prophylaxis and home therapy possible. This optimistic perception changed 
extremely in the early 1980s, when most people with hemophilia were infected 
with HIV and hepatitis viruses. Then, also in the 1980s, the rapid progress in 
molecular biology led to the development of recombinant therapeutic products. 
This important advancement was a huge technological leap fresh off from the 
earlier 1980s disaster. Now in the 21st century, the newer bioengineering drugs 
open a new hopeful phase for the management of hemophilia. The current efforts 
are concentrated on producing novel coagulation factors with prolonged 
bioavailability, increased potency, and resistance to inactivation and 
potentially reduced immunogenicity; this phase of evolution is improving very 
quickly. 2014 is the year of marketing approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration of the first bioengineered FVIII and FIX long-acting drugs, using 
Fc-fusion strategy. This represents the first significant advance in the 
hemophilia therapy that dramatically transforms patient management by 
substantially reducing the frequency of injections, improving compliance, and 
simplifying prophylaxis and, in turn, refining the quality of life of hemophilia 
patients, offering them a nearly normal life expectancy, particularly to 
newborns with hemophilia B.

BACKGROUND: There is a strong correlation between severe mental illness and 
criminality, but little is known about how these two problem areas together may 
affect health outcomes.
AIM: The objective of this paper is to compare survival rates of male 
psychiatric inpatients over a 25-year period who have and have not been subject 
to imprisonment, allowing for nature of psychiatric morbidity.
METHODS: A nationwide cohort of men who had ever been psychiatric inpatients was 
identified from Icelandic data-registers, and their diagnoses after first 
discharge, cumulative incidence of imprisonment, and mortality established from 
records. Using a nested case-control design, survival differences were 
determined between those ever imprisoned and those never imprisoned.
RESULTS: Between January 1983 and March 2008, 7665 men were admitted to 
psychiatric wards in Iceland, of whom 812 (10.6%) had served a prison sentence 
during that time. Cumulative incidence of imprisonment was highest in the 
youngest age group (21%). Substance use and personality disorders were more 
common amongst those imprisoned. All-cause mortality, adjusted for diagnosis, 
age, and year of admission, was twice as high amongst those imprisoned as those 
not imprisoned (Hazard ratio = 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.6, p < 0.001).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that psychiatric inpatients with 
criminal records should receive special attention with respect to all aspects of 
their health, not only within psychiatric services but also through more 
collaboration between the healthcare and judicial systems.

The longevity of multiple myeloma patients increased sharply since the late 
1990s. This increase coincided with the introduction of several important 
innovations in chemotherapy for myeloma. In this study, we aim to quantify the 
impact of recent chemotherapy innovation on the longevity of myeloma patients 
using both time-series US data and longitudinal data on 38 countries. We 
estimate that almost two-thirds (0.99 years) of the 1997-2005 increase in the 
life expectancy of American myeloma patients was due to an increase in the 
number of chemotherapy regimens now preferred by specialists. Based on a 
back-of-the-envelope calculation, this means that the cost per US life-year 
gained from post-1997 chemotherapy innovation is unlikely to have exceeded 
$46,000. We also investigate the impact of chemotherapy innovation on the 
myeloma mortality rate using longitudinal country-level data on 38 countries 
during the period 2002-2012. Countries that had larger increases in the number 
of chemotherapy regimens now preferred by specialists had larger subsequent 
declines in myeloma mortality rates, controlling for myeloma incidence. The 
(marginal) effect on the mortality rate of one additional preferred chemotherapy 
regimen is similar in other countries to its effect in the US. Non-US prices of 
two of the three new drugs were lower than US prices, so recent myeloma 
chemotherapy innovation may have been more cost-effective in other countries 
than it was in the US. Recent chemotherapy innovation has had a significant 
positive impact on the longevity of myeloma patients in the countries in which 
the drugs have been available.

While the importance of fathers in unmarried coparent families is a strong area 
of social and political interest, a dearth of community-based interventions 
exists for supporting the role of fathers in at-risk families. The Co-Parent 
Court (CPC) was a 3-year demonstration project evaluating the effectiveness of a 
collaborative intervention to support unmarried coparents establishing paternity 
and improving their coparenting relationships and paternal involvement in their 
child's life. A randomized-control experimental design was employed. The paper 
will explore father involvement and coparent relationship outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic knee joint pain is one of the most frequent 
complaints which is seen in the outpatient clinic in our medical institute. In 
previous studies we have reported the benefits of low level laser therapy (LLLT) 
for chronic pain in the shoulder joints, elbow, hand, finger and the lower back. 
The present study is a report on the effects of LLLT for chronic knee joint 
pain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over the past 5 years, 35 subjects visited the outpatient 
clinic with complaints of chronic knee joint pain caused by the knee 
osteoarthritis-induced degenerative meniscal tear. They received low level laser 
therapy. A 1000 mW semi-conductor laser device was used to deliver 20.1 J/cm(2) 
per point in continuous wave at 830nm, and four points were irradiated per 
session (1 treatment) twice a week for 4 weeks.
RESULTS: A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to determine the effects of LLLT 
for the chronic pain and after the end of the treatment regimen a significant 
improvement was observed (p<0.001). After treatment, no significant differences 
were observed in the knee joint range of motion. Discussions with the patients 
revealed that it was important for them to learn how to avoid postures that 
would cause them knee pain in everyday life in order to have continuous benefits 
from the treatment.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that 830 nm LLLT was an effective 
form of treatment for chronic knee pain caused by knee osteoarthritis. Patients 
were advised to undertake training involving gentle flexion and extension of the 
knee.

THE FRAGILITY OF THE FUTURE AND THE TUG OF THE PAST: LONGEVITY IN LATIN AMERICA 
AND THE CARIBBEAN.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Cohorts that will attain age 60 after 2010 in the Latin American and 
Caribbean region (LAC) are beneficiaries of a massive mortality decline that 
began as early as 1930. The bulk of this decline is due to diffusion of low-cost 
medical technology that improved recovery rates from infectious diseases. This 
changes the composition of elderly cohorts in a distinct way: more among those 
who could experience the deleterious impact of adverse early conditions as 
adults survive to attain old ages.
OBJECTIVE: To compute bounds for the size of effects on old age mortality of 
changes in cohorts' composition by exposure to early conditions. We calculate 
estimates for countries in the LAC region that span the entire range of 
post-1950 mortality decline.
METHODS: We use counterfactual population projections to estimate bounds of 
changes in the composition of cohorts by exposure to early conditions. These are 
combined with empirical effects of adverse early conditions on adult mortality 
to generate estimates of foregone gains in life expectancy at age 60.
RESULTS: under somewhat conservative assumptions life expectancy at age 60 will 
at best increase much more slowly than in the past and at worst reach a steady 
state or decline. Foregone gains may be as high as 20% of projected values over 
a period of 30 to 50 years, the time it takes for cohorts that reaped the 
benefits of the secular mortality decline to become extinct.
CONCLUSIONS: Changing composition of cohorts by early exposures constitutes a 
powerful force that could drag down or halt short-run progress of life 
expectancy at older ages.

The high and increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in Latin American 
and the Caribbean and the increasing prevalence of some obesity-related chronic 
diseases could be changing the current mortality patterns and the improvements 
in life expectancy of this population. The main objective of this study is to 
measure the effect of overweight and obesity on mortality in Mexico among 
elderly people (60 years and older). We use the Mexican Health and Ageing Study 
(MHAS, 2001 and 2003) that is a panel nationally-representative study of the 
population 50 years and older in Mexico. Our results show that excess body 
weight (defined by the two highest quintiles of Body Mass Index-BMI-) increases 
the risk of mortality at 60 years and older in Mexico. As much as 11% of the 
deaths among elderly that occurred during the period 2001-2003 in Mexico would 
have been avoided if overweight and obese people (individuals belonging to the 
highest two quintiles of BMI) had had the "ideal" weight (defined by the middle 
quintile, or third quintile, of BMI). At individual level, we estimate that 
individuals 60 years old with excess body weight (fourth and fifth quintiles of 
BMI) survive four years less, in average, than individuals with normal body 
weight (third quintile of BMI).

Medicine is continually evolving; the new technologies of diagnosis and 
treatment continue to improve the life expectancy and lead to new information 
concerning various pathologies. The autopsy is viewed more and more as an 
ultimate branch of medicine and used only in extreme cases or for forensic 
purposes. Nevertheless, many studies, including this one, prove the utility and 
indispensability of the autopsies, without which a complete and accurate 
diagnosis cannot be made. Finally, the autopsy followed by histopathological 
examination of the tissues remains the ultimate and most important step for the 
apprehension of the diseases and for further evolution of medicine. This study 
reveals the correspondence rate between the clinical and the postmortem 
diagnosis, as well as between macroscopic and histopathological diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Deprivation indices are increasingly being used to assess the 
effects of contextual factors on health. In Germany, the recently developed 
'German Index of Multiple Deprivation (GIMD)' integrates various dimensions of 
regional deprivation. We aim to assess the validity of the GIMD through a 
recalculation using more recent rural and urban district level data and by 
analysing its association with mortality at the national level.
METHODS: We calculated a new version of the GIMD based on data from 2007 to 2010 
for all 412 rural and urban districts in Germany. Mortality was quantified using 
indirectly standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Correlation analyses and 
Poisson regression analyses were used to assess the association between the GIMD 
scores and total mortality, as well as premature mortality (< 65 years).
RESULTS: Correlation analyses showed a positive association between the GIMD and 
both total mortality (p<0.001) and premature mortality (p<0.001). In the Poisson 
regression analyses, rural and urban districts in the quintile with the highest 
deprivation showed a significantly elevated risk of total mortality (RR: 1.29; 
95% CI: 1.28-1.30) as well as premature mortality (RR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.47-1.53), 
compared to the districts in the lowest quintile.
CONCLUSION: The association between regional deprivation and mortality has 
already been shown for the federal state of Bavaria. Using more recent data, 
this relationship could be confirmed here for Germany as a whole. The GIMD has 
been shown to be able to effectively assess regional deprivation. Concerning 
public health policy, the significant, positive and stable association between 
regional deprivation and mortality indicates an increased need for health care 
provision particularly in the most deprived districts. Further studies should 
examine, for example, whether and how the allocation of districts to quintiles 
of regional deprivation changes over time, and how this affects mortality.

In order to understand the mechanism governing radiation resistance in 
Deinococcus radiodurans, current efforts are aimed at identifying potential 
candidates from a large repertoire of unique Deinococcal genes and protein 
families. DR0053 belongs to the DinB/YfiT protein family, which is an 
over-represented protein family in D. radiodurans. We observed that dr0053 
transcript levels were highly induced in response to gamma radiation 
(γ-radiation) and mitomycin C (MMC) exposure depending on PprI, RecA and the 
DrtR/S two-component signal transduction system. Protein profiles demonstrated 
that DR0053 is a highly induced protein in cultures exposed to 10 kGy 
γ-radiation. We were able to determine the transcriptional start site of dr0053, 
which was induced upon irradiation, and to assign the 133-bp promoter region of 
dr0053 as essential for radiation responsiveness through primer extension and 
promoter deletion analyses. A dr0053 mutant strain displayed sensitivity to 
γ-radiation and MMC exposure, but not hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that DR0053 
helps cells recover from DNA damage. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that DR0053 
is similar to the Bacillus subtilis protein YjoA, which is a substrate of 
bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases. Taken together, the DNA damage-inducible 
(din) gene dr0053 may be regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational 
levels.

[Information theory of ageing: studying the effect of bone marrow 
transplantation on the life span of mice].

[Article in Russian]

In this paper the method of life span extension of multicellular organisms 
(human) using the reservation of stem cells followed by autotransplantation has 
been proposed. As the efficiency of this method results from the information 
theory of ageing, it is important to verify it experimentally testing the basic 
concepts of the theory. Taking it into consideration, the experiment on the bone 
marrow transplantation to old mice from young closely-related donors of the 
inbred line was carried out. It has been shown, that transplanted animals 
exhibited a survival advantage, a mean life span increased by 34% as compared to 
the control. This result not only demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed 
method for life span extension of multicellular organisms, but also confirms the 
basis of the information theory of ageing.

Hypotheses exploring the influence of dietary conditions on the life history 
trade-off between survival and reproductive success are extensively tested in 
female insects, but are rarely explored in males. Here, the impact of dietary 
quality and female access on age-specific reproduction and survival of male 
Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae), are 
examined. There is a clear cost of female access for males with access to 
dietary protein, measurable as a decrease in life expectancy, which is further 
influenced by the age when females are introduced. A protein deficient diet 
reduces the lifespan benefit of virginity and masks the detrimental effect of 
female access on male life expectancy. Dietary protein is not necessary for 
reproductive success, but access to protein at eclosion improves the lifetime 
reproductive success of males compared to when it is delayed. Overall, 
reproductive success diminishes as the male flies age, regardless of the dietary 
conditions, providing evidence for reproductive senescence in males. Delaying 
the males' access to a protein source fails to influence the negative effect of 
age on reproductive ability. Because age specific reproductive rates decline 
with age, regardless of diet, male fitness does not benefit from lifespan 
extension. Therefore, males can be expected to allocate available resources 
towards reproductive effort in favour of extended lifespan, regardless of mate 
and protein availability.

Nutraceuticals are products, which other than nutrition are also used as 
medicine. A nutraceutical product may be defined as a substance, which has 
physiological benefit or provides protection against chronic disease. 
Nutraceuticals may be used to improve health, delay the aging process, prevent 
chronic diseases, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function 
of the body. Nowadays, nutraceuticals have received considerable interest due to 
potential nutritional, safety and therapeutic effects. Recent studies have shown 
promising results for these compounds in various complications. In the present 
review much effort has been devoted to present new concepts about nutraceuticals 
based on their diseases modifying indications. Emphasis has been made to present 
herbal nutraceuticals effective on hard curative disorders related to oxidative 
stress including allergy, alzheimer, cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, eye, 
immune, inflammatory and Parkinson's diseases as well as obesity. The recently 
published papers about different aspects of nutraceuticals as alternative for 
pharmaceuticals were searched using scientific sites such as Medline, PubMed, 
and Google Scholar. The used terms included nutraceutical and allergy, 
alzheimer, cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, eye, immune, inflammatory or 
Parkinson.

HIV infection and osteoporosis.

Compston J(1).

(1)Department of Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus , Cambridge, UK.

In the past two decades, the life expectancy of people living with HIV infection 
has increased significantly, and osteoporosis has emerged as a significant 
comorbidity. In addition to traditional risk factors for fracture, specific 
factors related to HIV infection are also likely to contribute, including 
antiretroviral therapy. The heterogeneity of the HIV-infected population in 
terms of age and ethnicity presents many challenges to the prevention and 
management of bone disease, and further studies are required to establish 
optimal approaches to risk assessment and treatment.

Towards an HIV cure based on targeted killing of infected cells: different 
approaches against acute versus chronic infection.

Dey B(1), Berger EA.

Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current regimens of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) 
offer effective control of HIV infection, with maintenance of immune health and 
near-normal life expectancy. What will it take to progress beyond the status 
quo, whereby infectious virus can be eradicated (a 'sterilizing cure') or fully 
controlled without the need for ongoing cART (a 'functional cure')?
RECENT FINDINGS: On the basis of therapeutic advances in the cancer field, we 
propose that targeted cytotoxic therapy to kill HIV-infected cells represents a 
logical complement to cART for achieving an HIV cure. This concept is based on 
the fact that cART effectively blocks replication of the virus, but does not 
eliminate cells that are already infected; targeted cytotoxic therapy would 
contribute precisely this missing component. We suggest that different 
modalities are suited for curing primary acute versus established chronic 
infection. For acute infection, relatively short-acting potent agents such as 
recombinant immunotoxins might prove sufficient for HIV eradication, whereas for 
chronic infection, a long-lasting (lifelong?) modality is required to maintain 
full virus control, as might be achieved with genetically modified autologous T 
cells.
SUMMARY: We present perspectives for complementing cART with targeted cytotoxic 
therapy, whereby HIV infection is either eradicated or fully controlled, thereby 
eliminating the need for lifelong cART.

Can hospitals compete on quality? Hospital competition.

Iran, Somayeh.Sadat@alumni.utoronto.ca.

In this paper, we consider two hospitals with different perceived quality of 
care competing to capture a fraction of the total market demand. Patients select 
the hospital that provides the highest utility, which is a function of price and 
the patient's perceived quality of life during their life expectancy. We 
consider a market with a single class of patients and show that depending on the 
market demand and perceived quality of care of the hospitals, patients may enjoy 
a positive utility. Moreover, hospitals share the market demand based on their 
perceived quality of care and capacity. We also show that in a monopoly market 
(a market with a single hospital) the optimal demand captured by the hospital is 
independent of the perceived quality of care. We investigate the effects of 
different parameters including the market demand, hospitals' capacities, and 
perceived quality of care on the fraction of the demand that each hospital 
captures using some numerical examples.

OBJECTIVE: To present the methodological approach used to estimate injury 
morbidity (Years Lived with Disability, YLD) in the 2008 Global Burden of 
Disease study in Brazil (GBD-Br).
METHODS: YLD was based on the admission rate for injuries from both public and 
private sector facilities. Morbidity arising from emergency room (ER) visits was 
estimated using logistic regression models of the likelihood of hospitalization 
for different types of injuries, controlling for sex, age and geographic region. 
Data was obtained from the Mortality Information System, the Hospitalization 
Information System of the Unified Health System and the 2009 survey for the 
Surveillance System for Violence and Accidents (VIVA).
RESULTS: Injuries accounted for 10.0% of the total burden of disease in Brazil 
in 2008, corresponding to 19 years of life lost per 100 000 inhabitants. YLD 
accounted for 10% of total years of life lost.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach represents a methodological advance, particularly due 
to the inclusion of the VIVA survey, which provides a more reliable measurement 
of the burden of injury in Brazil than other sources.
