The life expectancy of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
is rising due to better access to combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART). 
Although ART has reduced acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related 
mortality and morbidity, there has been an increase in non-AIDS defining 
illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery 
disease (CAD). HIV is a disease marked by inflammation which has been associated 
with specific biological vascular processes increasing the risk of premature 
atherosclerosis. The combination of pre-existing risk factors, atherosclerosis, 
ART, opportunistic infections and coagulopathy contributes to rising CAD 
incidence. The prevalence of CAD has emerged as a major contributor of morbidity 
in these patients due to longer life expectancy. However, ART has been 
associated with lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes 
mellitus and CAD. These adverse effects, along with drug-drug interactions when 
ART is combined with cardiovascular drugs, result in significant challenges in 
the care of this group of patients. Exercise tolerance testing, 
echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, coronary computed tomography 
angiography and magnetic resonance imaging help in the diagnosis of CAD and 
heart failure and help predict cardiovascular outcomes in a manner similar to 
non-infected individuals. This review will highlight the pathogenesis and 
factors that link HIV to CAD, presentation and treatment of HIV-patients 
presenting with CAD and review briefly the cardiac imaging modalities used to 
identify this entity and help prognosticate future outcomes.

When diabetes mellitus is not properly controlled with drugs and a healthy 
lifestyle, it exposes patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease or 
critical limb ischaemia (CLI) to the most serious complications, in particular 
lower limb ulcers. Surgical or endovascular treatments represent the first line 
of intervention; in addition, the adequate management of ulcers can guarantee 
not only a faster wound healing but also the improvement of the patient's 
prognosis. To speed up this process, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and other advanced moist wound dressing have been 
proposed. During Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many patients 
with CLI and diabetes mellitus had difficult access to advanced treatments with 
a significant reduction in life expectancy. We report the cases of patients with 
non-healing ulcers and CLI treated with an empiric multistage approach after 
successful endovascular revascularisation; the postoperative course was eventful 
in all patients, and foot ulcers are currently in an advanced state of healing. 
The association between adequate revascularisation, systemic anti-inflammatory, 
and antibiotic therapy with the multistage advanced medications ensures healing 
of ulcers, limb salvage, and improvement of patient prognosis.

AIM: The present study aimed at evaluating the demographic, pathological and 
clinical characteristics of patients with colon cancer and also the survival 
rate and its related factors.
BACKGROUND: Cancer is the most important barrier to increasing life expectancy 
in the world. Furthermore, colon cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer in 
Iran.
METHODS: In this descriptive-analytical study, 219 patients with colon cancer 
were investigated. Data were analyzed through descriptive and univariate methods 
using R software. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to 
evaluate the survival rate of the patients.
RESULTS: In the present study, 25% of patients were below 50 years of age. A 
family history of cancer was positive in 30% of the patients. According to the 
clinical symptoms of the patients, rectorrhagia was higher in patients with 
sigmoid tumor site, abdominal pain was higher in patients with transverse and 
ascending tumor sites, and anemia was higher in patients with ascending and 
caecum tumor sites (p< 0.05). The mean life expectancy of the patients was 
53.71±2.07 months. Three-year, five-year and seven-year survival rates were 70, 
49, and 37 %, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Half of the patients were diagnosed at advanced stage and the mean 
survival time at advanced stage was approximately four years. One-third of the 
patients had local recurrence. It is recommended that patients refer to 
specialists at specified time intervals for timely diagnosis of the disease and 
prevention of its recurrence. Providing effective training for people in order 
for them to acquire more knowledge, and performing screening tests will lead to 
early diagnosis and lower mortality.

Caloric restriction (CR) is known to extend life span across species; however, 
the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We investigate the mechanism 
by which glucose restriction (GR) extends yeast replicative life span, by 
combining ribosome profiling and RNA-seq with microfluidic-based single-cell 
analysis. We discovered a cross-talk between glucose sensing and the regulation 
of intracellular methionine: GR down-regulated the transcription and translation 
of methionine biosynthetic enzymes and transporters, leading to a decreased 
intracellular methionine concentration; external supplementation of methionine 
cancels the life span extension by GR. Furthermore, genetic perturbations that 
decrease methionine synthesis/uptake extend life span. These observations 
suggest that intracellular methionine mediates the life span effects of various 
nutrient and genetic perturbations, and that the glucose-methionine cross-talk 
is a general mechanism for coordinating the nutrient status and the 
translation/growth of a cell. Our work also implicates proteasome as a 
downstream effector of the life span extension by GR.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening inherited condition in 
the Caucasian population, where mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in a multifactorial syndrome, with 
pulmonary disease representing the largest contributor to morbidity and 
mortality. Life expectancy has improved and the recent development of 
disease-modifying CFTR modulator therapies is likely to further improve 
survival. However, increasing life expectancy brings new challenges related to 
the complications of a chronic disease including an increasing prevalence of 
cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD), itself associated with increased 
morbidity and early mortality. This review provides an update as regards the 
underlying mechanisms, investigation and management of CFRD.

BACKGROUND: Combined catheter ablation (CA) and left atrial appendage closure 
(LAAC) have been proposed for management of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) 
in patients with high stroke and bleeding risk. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of combined CA and LAAC compared with CA and standard oral 
anticoagulation (OAC) in symptomatic AF.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess total costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among 2 post-CA 
strategies: (1) standard OAC and (2) LAAC (combined CA and LAAC procedure). The 
base-case used a 10-year time horizon and consisted of a hypothetical cohort of 
patients aged 65 years with symptomatic AF, with high thrombotic 
(CHA2DS2-VASc = 3) and bleeding risk (HAS-BLED = 3), and planned for AF 
ablation. Values for transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived 
from the literature. Costs were converted to 2020 US dollars. Half-cycle 
correction was applied, and costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed for significant variables and scenario 
analyses for higher embolic risk.
RESULTS: In the base-case cohort of 10,000 patients followed for 10 years, total 
costs for the LAAC strategy were $29,027 and for OAC strategy were $27,896. The 
LAAC strategy was associated with 122 fewer disabling strokes and 203 fewer 
intracranial hemorrhages per 10,000 patients compared with the OAC strategy. The 
LAAC strategy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $11,072/QALY. In 
sensitivity analyses, although cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on the 
risk of intracranial hemorrhage in the LAAC strategy and the cost of the 
combined procedure, LAAC was superior to OAC under the most circumstances. 
Scenario analyses demonstrated that the combined procedure was more 
cost-effective in patients with higher stroke risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic AF patients with high stroke and bleeding risk who 
are planned for CA, the combined CA and LAAC procedure may be a cost-effective 
therapeutic option and be more beneficial to patients with CHA2DS2-VASc risk 
score ≥3.

Tumor cells overexpress a variety of receptors that are emerging targets in 
cancer chemotherapy. Radiolabeled peptides with high affinity and selectivity 
for these overexpressed receptors have been designed for both imaging and 
therapy purposes. Such peptides display advantages such as high selectivity for 
tumor cells, rapid tumor tissue penetration, and rapid clearance from non-target 
tissues and the circulation. However, the very short in vivo half-life of 
radiolabeled peptides, arising from enzymatic degradation and/or efficient 
clearance by the kidney, limits their accumulation in tumors. This review 
presents various strategies that have been applied to extend the half-life 
extension and improve the pharmacokinetic characteristics of radiolabeled 
peptides. These include amino acid substitution, modification of the peptide 
termini, dimerization and multimerization of the peptide, cyclization, 
conjugation with polymers, sugars and albumin and use of peptidase inhibitors.

Investment in the behavioral change projects would not be possible without 
knowing their prerequisites and determinants including intention, moral norms, 
identity, and place attachment. Therefore, this study aimed at the determination 
of the effects of place attachment (PAT) (place dependence (PDE), place identity 
(PID), and place affect (PAF)) and farmers' identity (conservationist identity 
(CONID) and productivist identity (PROID)) on the moral norms of water 
conservation (MNWC) as well as the intention of water conservation (IWC) of the 
Iranian farmers. This was a descriptive-correlational and causal-relational 
study. The instrument of the study was a questionnaire completed using a 
cross-sectional survey and face-to-face interviews. Hence, a stratified random 
sampling method along with a proportionate allocation was used to select 380 
farmers. The research findings indicated that the PAT (PDE, PID, and PAF) and 
CONID had significant positive effects on the MNWC. In addition, MNWC and CONID 
had significant positive effects on the IWC. However, PROID had a significant 
negative effect on the MNWC and IWC. In general, it was found that independent 
variables (PDE, PID, PAF, PROID, and CONID) could predict 39% and 53% of the 
variance of the MNWC and IWC variables, respectively. Moreover, the 
social-psychological framework of the study provides practitioners, 
decision-makers, policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders of the 
agricultural water management with useful practical and theoretical insights 
about the practices of behavior changes and social interventions. Finally, it is 
recommended that government decision-makers should further focus on the 
increased attractiveness of the rural and agricultural areas to increase PAT, 
MNWC, and IWC.

Satisfactory host bone quality and quantity promote greater primary stability 
and better osseointegration, leading to a high success rate in the use of dental 
implants. However, the increase in life expectancy as a result of medical 
advancements has led to an aging population, suggesting that osteoporosis may 
become a problem in clinical dental implant surgery. Notably, relative to the 
general population, bone insufficiency is more common in women with 
post-menopausal osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to compare the 
thickness of the crestal cortical bone at prospective dental implant sites 
between menopausal and non-menopausal women. Prospective dental implant sites in 
the jawbone were evaluated in two groups of women: a younger group (<50 years 
old), with 149 sites in 48 women, and an older group (>50 years old) with 191 
sites, in 37 women. The thickness of the crestal cortical bone at the dental 
implant site was measured based on each patient's dental cone-beam computed 
tomography images. For both groups, one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's 
post-test were used to assess the correlation between cortical bone thickness 
and the presence of implants in the four jawbone regions. Student's t-test was 
further used to compare differences between the older and younger groups. From 
the retrospective study results, for both groups, thickness of the crestal 
cortical bone was the highest in the posterior mandible, followed by anterior 
mandible, anterior maxilla, and posterior maxilla. Compared with the younger 
group, the older group had a lower mean thickness of the crestal cortical bone. 
Among the four regions, however, only in the posterior maxilla was the crestal 
cortical bone significantly thinner in the older group than in the younger 
group.

In order to achieve significant improvements in quality, cost, and accessibility 
(the health "iron triangle"), innovation in organizational and service delivery 
models is necessary to increase the value of healthcare. The aim of this study 
is to evaluate the efficiency of a model of organizational innovation based on 
advanced practice nurse in the care of people with ostomies (APN-O) versus usual 
care. An observational, exploratory, analytical, prospective study with a 
six-month follow-up was carried out at 12 hospitals that implemented this model 
in Andalusia. A total of 75 patients who had undergone a digestive elimination 
ostomy and/or a urinary ostomy were followed for six months. Clinical outcomes, 
healthcare resources, health-related quality of life, and willingness to pay 
(WTP) were analyzed. The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal 
perspective, including healthcare costs and indirect costs. The cost difference 
between the two models was €136.99 and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained was 0.05965 (€2297 per QALY gained). At six months, the mean of WTP was 
€69 per APN-O consultation. This model contributes to increasing the value-based 
healthcare in ostomies. Results of this study suggested that APN-O is an 
effective patient management model for improving their health status and is 
highly efficient.

Due to medical advances and lifestyle changes, population life expectancy has 
increased. For this reason, it is important to achieve healthy aging by reducing 
the risk factors causing damage and pathologies associated with age. Through 
nutrition, one of the pillars of health, we are able to modify these factors 
through modulation of the intestinal microbiota. The Mediterranean and Oriental 
diets are proof of this, as well as the components present in them, such as 
fiber and polyphenols. These generate beneficial effects on the body thanks, in 
part, to their interaction with intestinal bacteria. Likewise, the low 
consumption of products with high fat content favors the state of the 
microbiota, contributing to the maintenance of good health.

A hallmark common to many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), is that patients develop proteinaceous deposits in their 
central nervous system (CNS). The progressive spreading of these inclusions from 
initially affected sites to interconnected brain areas is reminiscent of the 
behavior of bona fide prions in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies 
(TSEs), hence the term prion-like proteins has been coined. Despite intensive 
research, the exact mechanisms that facilitate the spreading of protein 
aggregation between cells, and the associated loss of neurons, remain poorly 
understood. As population demographics in many countries continue to shift to 
higher life expectancy, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is also 
rising. This represents a major challenge for healthcare systems and patients' 
families, since patients require extensive support over several years and there 
is still no therapy to cure or stop these diseases. The model organism 
Caenorhabditis elegans offers unique opportunities to accelerate research and 
drug development due to its genetic amenability, its transparency, and the high 
degree of conservation of molecular pathways. Here, we will review how recent 
studies that utilize this soil dwelling nematode have proceeded to investigate 
the propagation and intercellular transmission of prions and prion-like proteins 
and discuss their relevance by comparing their findings to observations in other 
model systems and patients.

Despite efforts to reduce its incidence, tuberculosis continues to burden the 
rapidly aging Korean society. This study aimed to investigate the current trend 
of tuberculosis burden in Korea and its projections to 2040. We used National 
Health Insurance claims data to calculate the disability-adjusted life years due 
to tuberculosis in Korea. Disability-adjusted life years were measured by 
summing the years of life lost and the years lived with disability using an 
incidence-based approach. We modeled the incidence rates using a time-series 
model for the projection of disability-adjusted life years accrued from 2020 to 
2040. The total disability-adjusted life years due to tuberculosis were 69, 64, 
59, and 49 disability-adjusted life years/100,000 population in 2014, 2015, 
2016, and 2017, respectively. In both sexes, disability-adjusted life years were 
the highest in those aged ≥80 years. Projected disability-adjusted life years 
showed a descending trend from 38 disability-adjusted life years/100,000 in 
2020, to 14 disability-adjusted life years/100,000 in 2040. Conversely, the 
projected disability-adjusted life years increased among females aged ≥80 years. 
Although the tuberculosis burden in Korea is decreasing, a high burden remains 
among the elderly. Therefore, interventions targeting those vulnerable are 
required.

Cataracts are the second most prioritized eye disease in the world. Cataracts 
are an expensive treatment because surgery is the only method that can treat the 
disease. This study aims to analyze the cost effectiveness of each operating 
procedure. Specifically, phacoemulsification and Small Incision Cataract Surgery 
(SICS) with Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) as the effectiveness 
indicator is used. This study is an observational analytic study with a 
prospective framework. The sample size is 130 patients who have undergone 
phacoemulsification and 25 patients who have undergone SICS. The DALY for 
phacoemulsification at Day-7 (D-7) is 0.3204, and at Day-21 (D-21), it is 
0.3204, while the DALY for SICS at D-7 is 0.3060, and at D-21, it is 0.3158. The 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cataract surgery at D-7 is USD 
$1872.49, and at D-21, it is USD $5861.71, whereas the Indonesian Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) is USD $4174.90. In conclusion, the phacoemulsification technique 
is more cost effective than the SICS technique. The ICER value is very cost 
effective at D-7 post-surgery compared to at D-21 post-surgery because the ICER 
is less than 1 GDP per capita per DALY.

Initial evidence suggests that lithium might affect life expectancy and the risk 
for different disease conditions, but most studies were conducted in patients on 
lithium medication. Little is known about the association of blood lithium 
levels within the physiological range with cardiometabolic risk factors and 
diet. We measured plasma lithium in a community-based sample from Northern 
Germany (samples taken between 2010 and 2012). All participants (aged 25-82 
years) underwent standardized examinations and completed a semi-quantitative 
food frequency questionnaire. Of several variables tested, the estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was statistically significantly (inversely) 
associated with lithium levels, mainly in individuals with slightly impaired 
renal function (eGFR < 75 mL/min/1.73 m2). Besides, lithium levels were 
positively associated with age and alcohol intake. Using reduced rank 
regression, we identified a dietary pattern explaining 8.63% variation in plasma 
lithium levels. Higher lithium levels were associated with higher intakes of 
potatoes, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, fruits, tea, beer, wine and 
dietetic products and lower intakes of pasta, rice, pork, chocolate, sweets, 
soft drinks, other alcoholic beverages, sauces and snacks. Our observations 
suggest that plasma lithium levels are associated inversely with kidney 
function, particularly in individuals with slightly impaired renal function, and 
positively with age and alcohol intake. Lithium at physiological levels was 
moderately related to an exploratory dietary pattern.

The Association between Combined Lifestyle Factors and All-Cause and 
Cause-Specific Mortality in Shiga Prefecture, Japan.

Prefecture, 522-8533 Hikone City, Japan.

BACKGROUND: To decrease mortality, the benefit of combined healthy lifestyles 
has been suggested but is still unclear, especially for cause-specific 
mortality. We examined the relationship between combined lifestyle factors and 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Shiga prefecture, Japan.
METHODS: This was an ecological study of 19 municipalities, using the data from 
the 2008-2012 standard mortality ratio (SMR) reported by the Ministry of Health 
and Welfare and the 2015 Health and Nutrition Survey in Shiga prefecture. The 
health behaviors score was calculated based on five factors (ranging from 0 to 
5): diet quality (assessed adherence to dietary reference intake for Japanese), 
smoking, alcohol drinking, regular exercise, and sleep duration. In the multiple 
linear regression, the relationships between the health behaviors score and SMR 
of all-cause, cancer, heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases were 
estimated by sex.
RESULTS: The health behaviors score was negatively associated with the cancer 
SMR in women (β = -0.968, p = 0.011). For other causes, no significant 
association was found for either sex. A greater proportion of those who never 
smoked (β = -0.780, p = 0.016) and those who had a higher quality diet (β = 
-0.703, p = 0.048) were associated with lower cancer SMR in women. Women's 
intake of some micronutrients, particularly fruits, was higher than men. This 
study suggests that a combination of health behaviors, especially never smoking 
and high-quality diet intake are associated with lower cancer SMR in women and 
could be helpful in prolonging life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
screening strategies among recently arrived migrants in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the health effects and costs of HCV 
screening from the healthcare perspective. A cohort of 50,000 recently arrived 
migrants was used. In this cohort, three HCV screening strategies were 
evaluated: (i) no screening, (ii) screening of migrants from HCV-endemic 
countries and (iii) screening of all migrants.
RESULTS: Strategy (ii) screening of migrants from HCV-endemic countries compared 
to strategy (i) no screening, yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of €971 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Strategy (iii) 
screening of all migrants compared with strategy (ii) screening of migrants from 
HCV-endemic countries yielded an ICER of €1005 per QALY gained. The budget 
impact of strategy (ii) screening of migrants from HCV-endemic countries and 
strategy (iii) screening of all migrants was €13,752,039 and €20,786,683, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: HCV screening is cost-effective. However, the budget impact may have 
a strong influence on decision making.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been shown to affect people all over the world. While 
life expectancy for people with CF has increased substantially, CF is still 
associated with death in infants and young children in many regions, 
particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). These countries face 
significant challenges to promote CF diagnosis and improvements to CF care due 
to financial constraints and a significant burden of other diseases. In this 
review, we describe the status of CF diagnosis and care in different LMIC 
settings, from four different parts of the world (Brazil, South Africa, Israel 
and India). We highlight challenges and opportunities for CF practitioners in 
LMIC to improve CF care and outcomes. While early CF diagnosis is the key to 
optimising outcomes, newborn screening may not be feasible for countries with 
lower CF incidence and higher birth rates, such as India or South Africa. CF 
therapies and care in LMIC need to be adapted to available resources of these 
countries. Collaboration initiatives of the global CF community with LMIC may 
improve CF care in these countries. Most individuals with CF in LMIC are not 
benefiting from CFTR modulator treatments due to the prohibitive cost of these 
drugs.

Diego, La Jolla, CA.

BACKGROUND: Yoga interventions can improve function and reduce pain in persons 
with chronic low back pain (cLBP).
OBJECTIVE: Using data from a recent trial of yoga for military veterans with 
cLBP, we analyzed the incremental cost-effectiveness of yoga compared with usual 
care.
METHODS: Participants (n=150) were randomized to either 2× weekly, 60-minute 
yoga sessions for 12 weeks, or to delayed treatment (DT). Outcomes were measured 
at 12 weeks, and 6 months. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured 
using the EQ-5D scale. A 30% improvement on the Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (primary outcome) served as an additional effectiveness measure. 
Intervention costs including personnel, materials, and transportation were 
tracked during the study. Health care costs were obtained from patient medical 
records. Health care organization and societal perspectives were examined with a 
12-month horizon.
RESULTS: Incremental QALYs gained by the yoga group over 12 months were 0.043. 
Intervention costs to deliver yoga were $307/participant. Negligible differences 
in health care costs were found between groups. From the health care 
organization perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to provide 
yoga was $4488/QALY. From the societal perspective, yoga was "dominant" 
providing both health benefit and cost savings. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis indicates an 89% chance of yoga being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay of $50,000. A scenario comparing the costs of yoga and 
physical therapy suggest that yoga may produce similar results at a much lower 
cost.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Yoga is a cost-effective treatment for reducing pain and 
disability among military veterans with cLBP.

Comment in
    Spinal Cord Ser Cases. 2021 Mar 19;7(1):22.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition affecting a person's 
independence and quality of life. Nerve transfers are increasingly used to 
restore critical upper extremity function. Electrodiagnostic studies guide 
operative planning but the implications for clinical outcomes is not well 
defined. This case study delineates how clinical examination and 
electrodiagnostics can define the varying patterns of neuronal injury to guide 
timing and strategy for optimal outcomes in nerve transfers.
CASE PRESENTATION: We discuss a 20-year-old man with a C6-7 spinal cord injury 
(SCI). We illustrate how history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic 
studies predicted patterns of upper and lower motor neuron injury, confirmed 
intraoperatively via direct nerve stimulation. We undertook brachialis nerve 
transfer to the median fascicles supplying flexor digitorum superficialis and 
anterior interosseous nerve (to restore digit flexion), and supinator nerve 
transfer to posterior interosseous nerve (to restore digit extension). 
Preoperative electrodiagnostics of the right upper extremity demonstrated a pure 
upper motor neuron injury to median innervated muscles, and mixed upper and 
lower motor neuron injury to radial innervated muscles. These findings were 
confirmed via intraoperative direct neuromuscular stimulation. The preoperative 
studies provided important information regarding the anatomic basis and time 
sensitivity of the proposed nerve transfers. At 2 years post operatively the 
reconstructed digit flexion and extension resulted in improved hand function and 
independence.
DISCUSSION: Upper and lower motor neuron injuries can coexist in individuals 
with SCI. This example provides proof-of-concept that preoperative 
electrodiagnostic studies predict LMN injury, and surgery can achieve positive 
outcomes if completed soon after SCI.

Cells utilise specialized polymerases from the Primase-Polymerase (Prim-Pol) 
superfamily to maintain genome stability. Prim-Pol's function in genome 
maintenance pathways including replication, repair and damage tolerance. 
Mycobacteria contain multiple Prim-Pols required for lesion repair, including 
Prim-PolC that performs short gap repair synthesis during excision repair. To 
understand the molecular basis of Prim-PolC's gap recognition and synthesis 
activities, we elucidated crystal structures of pre- and post-catalytic 
complexes bound to gapped DNA substrates. These intermediates explain its 
binding preference for short gaps and reveal a distinctive modus operandi called 
Synthesis-dependent Template Displacement (STD). This mechanism enables 
Prim-PolC to couple primer extension with template base dislocation, ensuring 
that the unpaired templating bases in the gap are ushered into the active site 
in an ordered manner. Insights provided by these structures establishes the 
molecular basis of Prim-PolC's gap recognition and extension activities, while 
also illuminating the mechanisms of primer extension utilised by closely related 
Prim-Pols.
