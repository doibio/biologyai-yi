INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplantation prolongs life expectancy in end-stage renal 
disease patients at a lesser cost than dialysis. Estimation of kidney function 
is crucial in the evaluation of prospective living kidney donors. Although 
unsurpassed in their precision methods of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
measurement with exogenous substances are invasive, expensive, and carry a risk 
for anaphylactic reactions. Alternatively, kidney function can also be assessed 
by GFR estimation formulas based on serum creatinine or novel markers such as 
cystatin C or β-trace protein (BTP). The aim of this study was to compare the 
performance of GFR estimation methods with reference scintigraphy-measured GFR 
in population of living kidney donor candidates.
METHODS: We included 25 prospective kidney donors (aged 28-64 years) and 
measured GFR with the following equations: Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet 
in Renal Disease (MDRD), Mayo Clinic, Nankivell, Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI; including cystatin C), and BTP based. GFR 
were assessed by (99)mTc-DTPA for reference. All estimation methods were 
compared with a reference by general linear models.
RESULTS: The precision of GFR estimation by all methods is unsatisfactory (30% 
margin of reference held in <50% of cases). Direction of regression coefficients 
is negative for some of the methods even when adjusted for body mass index 
(BMI). Of the study subjects, 64% were overweight/obese. BMI value is 
significantly correlated with measured GFR (P < .01). CKD-EPI estimation 
equations are the most precise methods of GFR estimation in this analysis; in 
addition, CKD-EPI cystatin C and combined creatinine/cystatin C estimators are 
robust to overweight/obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: The precision of GFR estimation is unsatisfactory, in part because 
of overweight, which adversely influences measured GFR, but also renders 
estimation methods unusable, except for CKD-EPI cystatin C and combined 
creatinine/cystatin C formulae. GFR measurement with exogenous substances 
remains the method of choice in the assessment of kidney function in prospective 
kidney donors. In addition, it provides useful information on differential 
(split) renal function.

In 2011, Konnopka et al. (Eur J Health Econ 12:345-352, 2011) published a 
top-down cost of illness study on the health burden, and direct and indirect 
costs of morbidity and mortality attributable to excess weight (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2)) 
in Germany in 2002. The objective of the current study was to update the 2002 
estimates to the year 2008. To simplify comparisons, we closely followed the 
methods and assumptions of the original study, using 2008 data for most input 
parameters (e.g. prevalence, mortality, resource use, costs). Excess weight 
related deaths increased by 31% (from 36,653 to 47,964) and associated years of 
potential life lost (from 428,093 to 588,237) and quality adjusted life years 
lost (from 367,722 to 505,748) by about 37%, respectively. Excess weight caused 
€16,797 million in total costs in 2008 (+70%), of which €8,647 million were 
direct costs (corresponding to 3.27% of total German health care expenditures in 
2008). About 73% (€12,235 million) of total excess weight related costs were 
attributable to obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)). The main drivers of direct costs were 
endocrinological (44%) and cardiovascular (38%) diseases. Indirect costs 
amounted to €8,150 million in 2008 (+62%), of which about two-thirds were 
indirect costs from unpaid work. The great majority of indirect costs were due 
to premature mortality (€5,669 million). The variation of input parameters 
(univariate sensitivity analyses) resulted in attributable costs between €8,978 
million (-47% compared to base case) and €25,060 million (+49%). The marked 
increase in excess weight related costs can largely be explained by increases in 
the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and to a lesser extent from increases 
in resource consumption, as well as increases in (unit) costs and wages 
(comprising 5.5% inflation).

OBJECTIVE: To contribute to the theoretical literature on personalized medicine, 
analyzing and integrating in an economic model, the decision a health authority 
faces when it must decide on the implementation of personalized medicine in a 
context of uncertainty.
METHODS: We carry out a stylized model to analyze the decision health 
authorities face when they do not have perfect information about the best 
treatment for a population of patients with a given disease. The health 
authorities decide whether to use a test to match patients with treatments 
(personalized medicine) to maximize health outcomes. Our model characterizes the 
situations under which personalized medicine dominates the alternative option of 
business-as-usual (treatment without previous test). We apply the model to the 
KRAS test for colorectal cancer, the PCA3 test for prostate cancer and the PCR 
test for the X-fragile syndrome, to illustrate how the parameters and variables 
of the model interact.
RESULTS: Implementation of personalized medicine requires, as a necessary 
condition, having some tests with high discriminatory power. This is not a 
sufficient condition and expected health outcomes must be taken into account to 
make a decision. When the specificity and the sensitivity of the test are low, 
the health authority prefers to apply a treatment to all patients without using 
the test. When both characteristic of the test are high, the health authorities 
prefer to personalize the treatments when expected health outcomes are better 
than those under the standard treatment. When we applied the model to the three 
aforementioned tests, the results illustrate how decisions are adopted in real 
world.
CONCLUSIONS: Although promising, the use of personalized medicine is still under 
scrutiny as there are important issues demanding a response. Personalized 
medicine may have an impact in the drug development processes, and contribute to 
the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery. Nevertheless, more 
accurate statistical and economic information related to tests results and 
treatment costs as well as additional medical information on the efficacy of the 
treatments are needed to adopt decisions that incorporate economic rationality.

PURPOSE: This study was done to identify the patterns and significant predictors 
influencing hospitalization of Korean men for alcohol use disorder.
METHODS: A descriptive study design was utilized. Data were collected using 
self-report questionnaires from 143 inpatients who met the DSM-5 alcohol use 
disorder criteria and were receiving treatment and 157 social drinkers living in 
the community. The questionnaires included Alcohol Use Disorders Identification 
Test (AUDIT), Alcohol Problems, Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire (AEQ), Life 
Position, and The Korean version of the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test 
(CAST-K). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, χ²-test, 
F-test, Pearson correlation coefficients, and logistic regression with forward 
stepwise.
RESULTS: AUDIT had significant correlations with alcohol problems, alcohol 
expectancy, and parents' alcoholism. In logistic regression, factors 
significantly affecting hospitalization were divorced (OR=4.18, 95% CI: 
1.28-13.71), graduation from elementary school (OR=28.50, 95% CI: 8.07-100.69), 
middle school (OR=6.66, 95% CI: 2.21-20.09), high school (OR=6.31, 95% CI: 
2.59-15.36), drinking alone (OR=9.07, 95% CI: 1.78-46.17), family history of 
alcoholism (OR=2.41, 95% CI: 1.11-5.25), interpersonal relationship problems 
(OR=1.28, 95% CI:1.17-1.41), and sexual enhancement of alcohol expectancy 
(OR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.94), which accounted for 53% of the variance.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that interpersonal relationship programs and 
customized cognitive programs for social drinkers in the community are needed to 
decreased alcohol related hospitalization in Korean men.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of gastric cancer. 
The study aimed to compare cost-effectiveness ratios of H. pylori test-and-treat 
programs to prevent gastric cancer in Taiwan, referring to the nationwide 
reimbursement database and expected years of life lost.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 1998-2009, there were 12,857 females and 24,945 
males with gastric adenocarcinoma in Taiwan National Cancer Registry. They were 
followed up to 2010 and linked to the reimbursement database of National Health 
Insurance and the national mortality registry to determine lifetime health 
expenditures and expected years of life lost. Cost-effectiveness ratios of H. 
pylori test-and-treat programs for prevention of gastric adenocarcinoma were 
compared between screenings with (13) C-urea breath test and with anti-H. pylori 
IgG.
RESULTS: The test-and-treat program with anti-H. pylori IgG to prevent gastric 
adenocarcinoma had lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than that with 
(13) C-urea breath test in both sexes (females: 244 vs 1071 US 
dollars/life-year; males: 312 vs 1431 US dollars/life-year). Cost saving would 
be achieved in an endemic area where H. pylori prevalence was >73.5%, or by 
selecting subpopulations with high absolute risk reduction rates of cancer after 
eradication. Moreover, expected years of life lost of gastric adenocarcinoma 
were higher and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of test-and-treat 
programs were more cost-effective in young adults (30-69 y/o) than in elders 
(≥70 y/o).
CONCLUSIONS: The test-and-treat program with anti-H. pylori IgG shall be 
cost-effective to prevent gastric adenocarcinoma in a high endemic area, 
especially beginning at 30 years of age when H. pylori prevalence rates become 
stabilized.

We describe the 'Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Matrix' (SARM) 
methodology that is based upon a special two-step application of the matched 
molecular pair (MMP) formalism. The SARM method has originally been designed for 
the extraction, organization, and visualization of compound series and 
associated SAR information from compound data sets. It has been further 
developed and adapted for other applications including compound design, activity 
prediction, library extension, and the navigation of multi-target activity 
spaces. The SARM approach and its extensions are presented here in context to 
introduce different types of applications and provide an example for the 
evolution of a computational methodology in pharmaceutical research.

OBJECTIVE: Estimating the cost-effectiveness of 18FDG-PET/CT (positron emission 
tomography) compared to computer tomography (CT) followed by 18FDG-PET/CT as a 
confirmatory test for a positive case at the end of treatment in Hodgkin's 
lymphoma (HL) patients under 18 years-old.
METHODS: A decision tree was built for comparing 18FDG-PET/CT to CT followed by 
18FDG-PET/CT as a confirmatory test for a positive case in detecting residual 
lesions; outcome was measured in life years gained (LYG). The cost-effectiveness 
ratio was calculated; the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP per LYG. 
Values were expressed in Colombian pesos for 2010 (1 US dollar=$ 1,897.89) and 
submitted to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Assuming a difference of 13 months in true positives' life expectancy 
compared to that for false negatives, the cost of an additional LYG with 
18FDG-PET/CT compared to CT followed by 18FDG-PET/CT as a confirmatory test for 
a positive case when evaluating the end of pediatric HL patients' treatment was 
$ 34,508,590 (COP).
CONCLUSION: If differential life-expectancy between true positives and false 
negatives is at least 1.03 years, then using 18FDG-PET/CT for evaluating the end 
of HL pediatric patients' therapy is a cost-effective strategy for Colombia.

United States life tables, 2010.

Arias E.

Objectives-This report presents complete period life tables for the United 
States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on agespecific death rates in 
2010. Methods-Data used to prepare the 2010 life tables are 2010 final mortality 
statistics; April 1, 2010 population estimates based on the 2010 decennial 
census; and 2010 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to 
estimate the 2010 life tables was first implemented with data year 2008. The 
methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains 
unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic 
origin for data year 2006. Results-In 2010, the overall expectation of life at 
birth was 78.7 years. Between 2009 and 2010, life expectancy at birth increased 
for all groups considered. Life expectancy increased for both males (from 76.0 
to 76.2) and females (80.9 to 81.0) and for the white population (78.8 to 78.9), 
the black population (74.7 to 75.1), the Hispanic population (81.1 to 81.4), the 
non-Hispanic white population (78.7 to 78.8), and the non-Hispanic black 
population (74.4 to 74.7).

Sacramento, California.

With longer life expectancy, the number of burn injuries in the elderly 
continues to increase. Prediction of outcomes for the elderly is complicated by 
preinjury physical fitness and comorbid illness. The authors hypothesize that 
admission frailty assessment would be predictive of outcomes in the elderly burn 
population. Our primary aim was to determine if higher frailty scores were 
associated with higher risk of mortality for elderly burn patients. The 
secondary aims were to assess if higher frailty scores were associated with 
increased length of stay, increased needs for mechanical ventilation and poor 
discharge disposition. A 2-year retrospective chart review was performed of all 
admitted acute burn patients 65 years or older. Data collected included: age, 
gender, %TBSA of burn injury, presence of inhalation injury, in hospital 
mortality, hospital length of stay, ventilator days, ICU length of stay, 
surgical procedures, insurance status, and discharge disposition. Frailty scores 
were assessed from admission data and calculated using the Canadian Study of 
Health and Aging clinical frailty scale. A total of 89 patients met entry 
criteria. Mean age was 75.3 ± 8.1 years and consisted of 62 men and 27 women. 
Mean %TBSA was 9.6 ± 9.1% and mean frailty score (FS) was 4.5 ± 1.2. Eighty 
patients survived to discharge and nine died. Nonsurvivors had significantly 
higher FS compared to survivors (5.2 ± 1.2 vs 4.4 ± 1.2). FS were also 
significantly higher in patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNF) 
(5.34 ± 0.9) compared to those who were discharged home (4.1 ± 1.2) or to 
physical rehabilitation facilities (4 ± 1.5). Multivariate linear regression 
analysis revealed that age (B = 0.04) and discharge to SNF (B = 1.2) are 
independently associated with higher FS. However, survivors were independently 
associated with a significantly lower FS (B = -1.3). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis revealed high admission FS independently increased the risk 
of discharge to SNF (odds ratio of 2.5 [1.3-4.8, 95% confidence interval]) and 
increased the risk of mortality (odds ratio of 1.67 [1.01-2.7, 95% confidence 
interval]). Frailty scores on admission allow for a more complete assessment of 
elderly patients and can be used to establish benchmark models for burn injury 
outcomes. In addition FS can be used as a research tool to improve outcomes for 
elderly burn injured patients.

Uptake of antiretroviral regimens with associated durable virologic suppression 
has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Expanding antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) programs at a population level may serve as a vital strategy in 
the elimination of the AIDS epidemic. The global expansion of ART programs has 
greatly improved access to life-saving therapies and is likely to achieve the 
target of 15 million individuals on therapy set by UNAIDS. In addition to the 
incontrovertible gains in terms of life expectancy, growing evidence 
demonstrates that durable virologic suppression is associated with significant 
reductions in HIV transmission amongst heterosexual couples and men who have sex 
with men. Expansion of successful ART programs, best monitored by a 
program-level continuum of care cascade to assess progress in diagnosis, 
retention in care, and virologic suppression, is associated with reductions in 
HIV incidence at a population level. Expanding and sustaining successful ART 
delivery at a global level is a key component in a comprehensive approach to 
combating the HIV epidemic over the next two decades.

BACKGROUND: The risk of further intra-articular damage associated with 
nonoperative or delayed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction must be 
considered against the risk of growth disturbance with early reconstruction and 
transphyseal drilling. Long-term follow-ups after the surgical treatment of ACL 
injuries in adolescents are rare.
PURPOSE: To evaluate results 10 to 20 years after ACL reconstruction in terms of 
the radiographic presence of osteoarthritis, clinical assessments, and 
health-related quality of life in patients who were adolescents at the time of 
surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
METHODS: Thirty-two adolescents (mean age, 15.2 years [range, 12-16 years]; 11 
boys, 21 girls), with a symptomatic unilateral ACL rupture, underwent 
reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone (n=10) or hamstring tendon (n=22) 
autografts at an almost skeletally mature age according to Tanner stage 4. 
Twenty-nine patients (91%) underwent clinical, radiographic, and health-related 
quality of life assessments after 10 to 20 years (mean, 175 months).
RESULTS: The mean time between the injury and index surgery was 11.6 months. The 
reconstructed knee had significantly more osteoarthritic changes compared with 
the noninvolved contralateral knee (P=.001). Preoperatively, the median Tegner 
activity level was 4 (range, 2-8), and the median Lysholm knee score was 75 
(range, 50-90) points. At follow-up, the respective median values were 4 (range, 
1-7) and 84 (range, 34-100) points (P=not significant [preoperatively vs 
follow-up]). The median finding for the single-legged hop test was 84% (range, 
0%-105%) preoperatively and 93% (range, 53%-126%) at follow-up (P=.01). At 
follow-up, muscle strength measurements displayed more than 90% of the 
noninvolved leg in both extension and flexion. The manual Lachman test result 
was significantly improved at follow-up compared with preoperatively (P<.001). 
The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) revealed scores comparable with 
those of healthy controls. The mean EuroQol (EQ-5D) score was 0.86±0.12. The 
Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) values were lower in all 
dimensions compared with age-matched healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: In the long term, patients who were adolescents at the time of ACL 
reconstruction revealed significantly more radiographically visible 
osteoarthritic changes in their operated knee than in their noninvolved 
contralateral knee. Clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life are 
comparable with those of healthy controls.

cost-utility analyses are usually elicited from members of the general 
population. Public attitudes and understanding of dementia in particular may 
mean that values elicited from the general population may differ from patients 
and carers for dementia health states. This study examines how the population 
impacts utility values elicited for dementia health states using 
interviewer-administered time tradeoff valuation of health states defined by the 
dementia-specific preference-based measures DEMQOL-U (patient-report) and 
DEMQOL-Proxy-U (carer-report). Eight DEMQOL-U states were valued by 78 members 
of the UK general population and 71 patients with dementia of mild severity. 
Eight DEMQOL-Proxy-U states were valued by 77 members of the UK general 
population and 71 carers of patients with dementia of mild severity. 
Random-effects generalized least squares regression estimated the impact of 
population, dementia health state, and respondent sociodemographic 
characteristics on elicited values, finding that values for dementia health 
states differed by population and that the difference varied across dementia 
health states. Patients with dementia and carers of patients with dementia gave 
systematically lower values than members of the general population that were not 
due to differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of the populations. 
Our results suggest that the population used to produce dementia health state 
values could impact the results of cost-utility analyses and potentially affect 
resource allocation decisions; yet, currently, only general population values 
are available for usage.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to measure burden of disease and identifies health 
priorities from the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) indicator.
METHODS: This is the first study on burden of disease for a department in 
Colombia by using a standardized methodology. By using the. DALYs indicator, 
burden of disease was identified in the department of Nariño according to the 
guidelines established by the World Health Organization.
RESULTS: The DALYs in the Department of Nariño highlight the emergence of 
communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional diseases during the first 
years of life; of accidents and lesions among youth, and non-communicable 
diseases in older individuals. Also, accidents and lesions are highlighted in 
men and non-communicable diseases in women.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is part of the knowledge management process in the 
Departmental Health Plan for Nariño - Colombia 2012-2015 and contributes to the 
system of indicators of the 2012 ten-year public health plan. This research 
evidences that communicable diseases generate the biggest part of the burden of 
disease in the Department of Nariño, that DALYs due to non-communicable diseases 
are on the rise, and that accidents and lesions, especially due to violence are 
an important cause of DALYs in this region, which is higher than that of the 
country.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Medir la carga de enfermedad e identificar las prioridades 
de salud a partir del indicador Años de Vida Saludables Perdidos (AVISA).
MÉTODOS: Mediante el uso del indicador AVISA, identificar la carga de enfermedad 
en el departamento de Nariño según la Guía de la Organización Mundial de la 
Salud.
RESULTADOS: Este es el primer estudio de carga de enfermedad de un departamento 
en Colombia que utiliza una metodología estandarizada. Los AVISA en el 
Departamento de Nariño destacan la emergencia de las enfermedades transmisibles, 
maternales, perinatales y nutricionales en los primeros años de vida; de los 
accidentes y lesiones entre los jóvenes y las enfermedades no trasmisibles en 
individuos mayores; así como los accidentes y lesiones destacan en los hombres y 
las enfermedades no transmisibles en las mujeres.
CONCLUSIONES: Este estudio es parte del proceso de gestión de conocimiento del 
Plan de Salud Departamental de Nariño -Colombia 2012-2015 y contribuye al 
sistema de indicadores del plan decenal de salud pública 2012. Esta 
investigación evidencia que las enfermedades trasmisibles generan la mayor parte 
de la carga de enfermedad del Departamento de Nariño, que los AVISA por 
enfermedades no transmisibles están en ascenso, y que los accidentes y lesiones, 
especialmente por causa de la violencia son una causa importante de AVISA en 
esta región, siendo superior a la del país.

85 Uppsala, Sweden.

The history of bariatric surgery is investigational. Dedicated surgeons have 
continuously sought for an ideal procedure to relieve morbidly obese patients 
from their burden of comorbid conditions, reduced life expectancy and low 
quality of life. The ideal procedure must have low complication risk, both in 
short- and long term, as well as minimal impact on daily life. The revolution of 
laparoscopic techniques in bariatric surgery is described in this summary. 
Advances in minimal invasive techniques have contributed to reduced operative 
time, length of stay, and complications. The development in bariatric surgery 
has been exceptional, resulting in a dramatic increase of the number of 
procedures performed world wide during the last decades. Although, a complex 
bariatric procedure can be performed with operative mortality no greater than 
cholecystectomy, specific procedure-related complications and other drawbacks 
must be taken into account. The evolution of laparoscopy will be the legacy of 
the 21(st) century and at present, day-care surgery and further reduction of the 
operative trauma is in focus. The impressive effects on comorbid conditions have 
prompted the adoption of minimal invasive bariatric procedures into the field of 
metabolic surgery.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) are increasingly common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The 
diagnosis of NASH is challenging as most affected patients are symptom-free and 
the role of routine screening is not clearly established. Most patients with 
severe obesity who undergo bariatric surgery have NAFLD, which is associated 
insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and 
obesity-related dyslipidemia. The effective treatment for NAFLD is weight 
reduction through lifestyle modifications, antiobesity medication, or bariatric 
surgery. Among these treatments, bariatric surgery is the most reliable method 
for achieving substantial, sustained weight loss. This procedure is safe when 
performed by a skilled surgeon, and the benefits include reduced weight, 
improved quality of life, decreased obesity-related comorbidities, and increased 
life expectancy. Further research is urgently needed to determine the best use 
of bariatric surgery with NAFLD patients at high risk of developing liver 
cirrhosis and its role in modulating complications of NAFLD, such as T2DM and 
cardiovascular disease. The current evidence suggests that bariatric surgery for 
patients with severe obesity decreases the grade of steatosis, hepatic 
inflammation, and fibrosis. However, further long-term studies are required to 
confirm the true effects before recommending bariatric surgery as a potential 
treatment for NASH.

Therapy of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a rapidly changing field due to plenty of 
currently emerging data. Treatment approaches are currently based on tailoring 
of therapy in order to achieve a maximal response with minimal toxicity. Since 
the median age of HL patients is 33 years and their prospective life expectancy 
of another half a century, a major emphasis needs to be put on dramatic 
reduction of later toxicity. The assessment of the treatment effect should be 
based not only on progression-free survival, but should include evaluation of 
cardiac toxicity, secondary neoplasms, and fertility in the long-term follow-up. 
The ancient principle "first do no harm" should be central in HL therapy. 
Completion of ongoing and currently initiated trials could elucidate multiple 
issues related to the management of HL patients.

Exogenous insulin administration is currently the only treatment available to 
all type 1 diabetes patients, but it is not a cure. By helping to regulate 
circulating blood glucose levels, it has significantly improved life expectancy, 
but there are still long-term complications associated with the disease that may 
be preventable with a treatment strategy that can provide better glycemic 
control. Isolated islet (or whole pancreas) transplantation, 
xenotransplantation, and the transplant of human pluripotent stem cell-derived 
β-cells provide the potential to restore endogenous insulin production and 
reestablish normoglycemia. Here, we discuss the latest advances in these fields, 
including the use of encapsulation technology, as well as some of the hurdles 
that still need to be overcome for these alternative therapies to become 
mainstream and/or progress to clinical development.

Burden of myocardial infarction attributable to road-traffic noise: a pilot 
study in Belgrade.

Author information:

Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.

The aim of this pilot study was to calculate the disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY) as a quantification of the burden of myocardial infarction (MI) 
attributable to road-traffic noise in Belgrade, Serbia. Exposure to road-traffic 
noise was estimated on a sample of almost 6000 adult inhabitants living in the 
central municipality Stari Grad in Belgrade, Serbia. Each participant was 
assigned to daytime noise levels for 16 h exposure measured on the street of 
current residence. Population-attributable fraction of MI due to road-traffic 
noise was calculated based on the distribution of the population in different 
noise exposure categories and the respective relative risk of MI compared to the 
reference level. DALYs due to noise-related MI were calculated as the sum of 
years of life lost and years with disability. The contribution of road traffic 
noise to the occurrence of MI for the population of the municipality Stari Grad 
in Belgrade equals 2.518%. Total DALY for MI due to road-traffic noise results 
in 176 years, that is, 115 years for men and 61 years for women. When adjusted 
for the present size of the population in Belgrade, total DALY due to 
road-traffic noise equals 107 years/million inhabitants that is, 70/million 
inhabitants for men and 37/million inhabitants for women. The burden of disease 
due to road-traffic noise in Belgrade is relatively small but noteworthy from 
the public health point of view.

Geriatric Medicine, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: To assess the association between demographics, comorbidity, 
geriatric conditions, and three health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes 
one year after acute hospitalisation in older patients.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study conducted between 2006 and 2009 with 
one-year follow-up in 11 medical wards at two university hospitals and one 
teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Participants were 473 patients of 65 years 
and older, acutely hospitalised for more than 48 hours. Demographics, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI), and data on 18 geriatric conditions were collected at 
baseline. At baseline and 12 months post-admission, the EuroQol-5D was 
administered. Based on a population-derived valuation (Dutch EuroQol-5D tariff), 
utilities (range -0.38-1.00) were determined, which were used to calculate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) over one year (max QALY score 1). The 
EuroQol-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) (range 0-100) was also used. Linear 
regression analyses were performed to explore the association between the 
independent variables and the three HRQOL outcomes.
RESULTS: CCI was most consistently significantly associated with HRQOL outcomes: 
Beta -0.05 (95% CI -0.06--0.03) for utility, -0.04 (95% CI -0.05-0.03) for QALY, 
-1.03 (95% CI -2.06-0.00) for VAS, p < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.05, respectively). 
Baseline utility was significantly associated with one-year utility (beta 0.25, 
95% CI 0.11-0.39, p < 0.01) and QALY (beta 0.31, 95% CI 0.17-0.45, p < 0.001). 
The number of geriatric conditions at baseline was more strongly associated with 
one-year utility than any individual geriatric condition.
CONCLUSION: Less comorbidity, better utility and less geriatric conditions at 
baseline were associated with better HRQOL one year after acute hospitalisation 
in older patients.

Modulation of the Aβ peptide aggregation pathway by KP1019 limits Aβ-associated 
neurotoxicity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is increasing 
worldwide due to increased life expectancy. AD is characterized by two 
pathological hallmarks in the brain: amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposits and 
neurofibrillary tangles. A focus of AD research has concentrated on either 
inhibiting Aβ peptide aggregation that leads to plaque formation or breaking 
down pre-formed Aβ peptide aggregates. An alternative approach is to modulate 
the Aβ aggregation profile by facilitating the formation of Aβ species that are 
off-pathway and non-toxic. Herein, we report the re-purposing of the widely 
studied Ru(iii) anti-cancer complex KP1019, towards regulating the aggregation 
profile of the Aβ peptide. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectroscopy, we conclude that KP1019 binds to histidine residues, located at 
the N-terminus of the peptide, in a rapid and robust fashion. Native gels and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses have provided insight into the 
species and structures that are generated by KP1019-Aβ interactions. Finally, 
incubation in an in vitro human neuronal cell model has demonstrated that the 
formation of KP1019-Aβ species rescues cell viability from Aβ-associated 
neurotoxicity. Modulation of the Aβ aggregation pathway via covalent 
interactions with small molecules is thus a promising AD therapeutic strategy.

The Project Epidemiological Surveillance of Health Status of Resident Population 
Around the Waste Treatment Plants (SESPIR) included five Italian regions 
(Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Lazio, Campania, and Sicily) and the National 
Institute of Health in the period 2010-2013. SESPIR was funded by the Ministry 
of Health as part of the National centre for diseases prevention and control 
(CCM) programme of 2010 with the general objective to provide methods and 
operational tools for the implementation of surveillance systems for waste and 
health, aimed at assessing the impact of the municipal solid waste (MSW) 
treatment cycle on the health of the population. The specific objective was to 
assess health impacts resulting from the presence of disposal facilities related 
to different regional scenarios of waste management. Suitable tools for analysis 
of integrated assessment of environmental and health impact were developed and 
applied, using current demographic, environmental and health data. In this 
article, the methodology used for the quantitative estimation of the impact on 
the health of populations living nearby incinerators, landfills and mechanical 
biological treatment plants is showed, as well as the analysis of three 
different temporal scenarios: the first related to the existing plants in the 
period 2008-2009 (baseline), the second based on regional plans, the latter 
referring to MSW virtuous policy management based on reduction of produced waste 
and an intense recovery policy.

The SESPIR Project (Epidemiological Surveillance of Health Status of Resident 
Population Around the Waste Treatment Plants) assessed the impact on health of 
residents nearby incinerators, landfills and mechanical biological treatment 
plants in five Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Lazio, Campania, and 
Sicily). The assessment procedure took into account the available knowledge on 
health effects of waste disposal facilities. Analyses were related to three 
different scenarios: a Baseline scenario, referred to plants active in 
2008-2009; the regional future scenario, with plants expected in the waste 
regional plans; a virtuous scenario (Green 2020), based on a policy management 
of municipal solid waste (MSW) through the reduction of production and an 
intense recovery policy. Facing with a total population of around 24 million for 
the 5 regions, the residents nearby the plants were more than 380,000 people at 
Baseline. Such a population is reduced to approximately 330.000 inhabitants and 
170.000 inhabitants in the regional and Green 2020 scenarios, respectively. The 
health impact was assessed for the period 2008-2040. At Baseline, 1-2 cases per 
year of cancer attributable to MSW plants were estimated, as well as 26 cases 
per year of adverse pregnancy outcomes (including low birth weight and birth 
defects), 102 persons with respiratory symptoms, and about a thousand affected 
from annoyance caused by odours. These annual estimates are translated into 
2,725 years of life with disability (DALYs) estimated for the entire period. The 
DALYs are reduced by approximately 20% and 80% in the two future scenarios. Even 
in these cases, health impact is given by the greater effects on pregnancy and 
the annoyance associated with the odours of plants. In spite of the limitations 
due to the inevitable assumptions required by the present exercise, the proposed 
methodology is suitable for a first approach to assess different policies that 
can be adopted in regional planning in the field of waste management. The 
greatest reduction in health impact is achieved with a virtuous policy of 
reducing waste production and a significant increase in the collection and 
recycling of waste.
