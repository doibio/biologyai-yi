limb ischemia (CLI) or acute limb ischemia (ALI) who underwent revascularization 
at the authors' institution between 2002 and 2013 were included in this 
retrospective study. Risk factors were evaluated and survival, limb salvage, and 
amputation free survival (AFS) assessed.
RESULTS: The median age of the study population was 92 years (range 90-100 
years). The majority (81.1%) of the patients were female. One in four (24.5%) 
patients had diabetes, and the incidence of coronary artery disease was 79.8%. 
Seventy-three percent of the patients had CLI and 27% of had ALI. Seventy 
percent of the patients underwent surgical revascularization and 30% were 
treated endovascularly. The majority (72.5%) of the patients maintained their 
independent living status; 27.5% ended up in institutional care 
post-operatively. Similarly, the majority (82.0%) of the patients maintained 
their walking ability, while 18% were not able to ambulate independently after 
revascularization. One year survival, limb salvage, and AFS rates were 50.9% 
versus 48.6% (p = .505), 85.1% versus 87.0% (p = .259), and 45.7% versus 44.4% 
(p = .309) in the surgical versus endovascular group, respectively. Dementia was 
an independent risk factor of poor AFS (odds ratio: 1.56; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.077-2.272; p = .019).
CONCLUSION: Good limb salvage can be achieved by both surgical and endovascular 
revascularization, and independent living can be maintained in the majority of 
the patients. However, the benefit of revascularization is limited owing to high 
mortality, especially in patients with dementia.

BACKGROUND: Improvements in clinical care have led to increased life expectancy 
in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) over the past several decades. Whether 
these improvements have had significant effects on bone health in patients with 
CF is unclear.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study comparing clinical characteristics and 
bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 
adults with CF evaluated in 1995-1999 to age-, race-, and gender-matched 
patients with CF evaluated in 2011-2013 at the same center on calibrated DXA 
machines.
RESULTS: The cohorts were similar in terms of age, BMI, pancreatic 
insufficiency, presence of F508del mutation, and reproductive history. In the 
most recent cohort, pulmonary function was superior, and fewer patients had 
vitamin D deficiency or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Areal BMD measures of the 
PA spine, lateral spine, and distal radius were similarly low in the two 
cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Although pulmonary function and vitamin D status were better in 
patients in the present-day cohort, areal BMD of the spine was reduced in a 
significant number of patients and was no different in patients with CF today 
than in the late 1990s. Further attention to optimizing bone health may be 
necessary to prevent CF-related bone disease.

Therapeutic vaccinations have a potential application in infections where no 
curative treatment is available. In contrast to HIV, efficacious vaccines for a 
cat retrovirus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), are commercially available. 
However, the infection is still prevalent, and no effective treatment of the 
infection is known. By vaccinating persistently FeLV-infected cats and 
presenting FeLV antigens to the immune system of the host, e.g., in the form of 
recombinant and/or adjuvanted antigens, we intended to shift the balance toward 
an advantage of the host so that persistent infection could be overcome by the 
infected cat. Two commercially available FeLV vaccines efficacious in protecting 
naïve cats from FeLV infection were tested in six experimentally and 
persistently FeLV-infected cats: first, a canarypox-vectored vaccine, and 
second, an adjuvanted, recombinant envelope vaccine was repeatedly administered 
with the aim to stimulate the immune system. No beneficial effects on p27 
antigen and plasma viral RNA loads, anti-FeLV antibodies, or life expectancy of 
the cats were detected. The cats were unable to overcome or decrease viremia. 
Some cats developed antibodies to FeLV antigens although not protective. Thus, 
we cannot recommend vaccinating persistently FeLV-infected cats as a means of 
improving their FeLV status, quality of life or life expectancy. We suggest 
testing of all cats for FeLV infection prior to FeLV vaccination.

Cell positioning and neuronal network formation are crucial for proper brain 
function. Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is anterogradely transported to 
the neurite tips, together with Lis1, and functions in neurite extension via 
suppression of GSK3β activity. Then, transported Lis1 is retrogradely 
transported and functions in cell migration. Here, we show that DISC1-binding 
zinc finger protein (DBZ), together with DISC1, regulates mouse cortical cell 
positioning and neurite development in vivo. DBZ hindered Ndel1 phosphorylation 
at threonine 219 and serine 251. DBZ depletion or expression of a 
double-phosphorylated mimetic form of Ndel1 impaired the transport of Lis1 and 
DISC1 to the neurite tips and hampered microtubule elongation. Moreover, 
application of DISC1 or a GSK3β inhibitor rescued the impairments caused by DBZ 
insufficiency or double-phosphorylated Ndel1 expression. We concluded that DBZ 
controls cell positioning and neurite development by interfering with Ndel1 from 
disproportionate phosphorylation, which is critical for appropriate anterograde 
transport of the DISC1-complex.

Stimuli from different sensory modalities occurring on or close to the body are 
integrated in a multisensory representation of the space surrounding the body, 
i.e., peripersonal space (PPS). PPS dynamically modifies depending on 
experience, e.g., it extends after using a tool to reach far objects. However, 
the neural mechanism underlying PPS plasticity after tool use is largely 
unknown. Here we use a combined computational-behavioral approach to propose and 
test a possible mechanism accounting for PPS extension. We first present a 
neural network model simulating audio-tactile representation in the PPS around 
one hand. Simulation experiments showed that our model reproduced the main 
property of PPS neurons, i.e., selective multisensory response for stimuli 
occurring close to the hand. We used the neural network model to simulate the 
effects of a tool-use training. In terms of sensory inputs, tool use was 
conceptualized as a concurrent tactile stimulation from the hand, due to holding 
the tool, and an auditory stimulation from the far space, due to tool-mediated 
action. Results showed that after exposure to those inputs, PPS neurons 
responded also to multisensory stimuli far from the hand. The model thus 
suggests that synchronous pairing of tactile hand stimulation and auditory 
stimulation from the far space is sufficient to extend PPS, such as after 
tool-use. Such prediction was confirmed by a behavioral experiment, where we 
used an audio-tactile interaction paradigm to measure the boundaries of PPS 
representation. We found that PPS extended after synchronous tactile-hand 
stimulation and auditory-far stimulation in a group of healthy volunteers. 
Control experiments both in simulation and behavioral settings showed that the 
same amount of tactile and auditory inputs administered out of synchrony did not 
change PPS representation. We conclude by proposing a simple, 
biological-plausible model to explain plasticity in PPS representation after 
tool-use, which is supported by computational and behavioral data.

Obstructive jaundice by lymph node recurrence of gastric cancer: can surgical 
derivation still play a role?

Marchesi F, Mita MT, Cecchini S, Ziccarelli A, Michieletti E, Del Rio P, 
Roncoroni L.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: In some cases of bile duct compression by lymph node recurrence 
of gastric cancer, a second line chemotherapy can lead to prolonged survival; 
thus, a surgical derivation could represent a reasonable alternative to non 
surgical drainage, owing to its better long term efficacy. Our study 
retrospectively compares the surgical approach (SA) and percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in this particular oncological condition.
METHODOLOGY: 11 patients undergoing biliary-jejunal anastomosis for obstructive 
jaundice by lymph node recurrence of gastric cancer at our Institution were 
compared with 10 patients undergoing PTBD. Clinical records and outcome 
parameters (success rate, complications, survival) were statistically matched in 
order to assess possible advantages for each technique and to evaluate any 
particular variable influencing survival.
RESULTS: The SA patients experienced a better jaundice resolution (91% vs 50%, 
p.0.063), a lower major complication rate (9% vs 30%, p:0.311), and a 
significantly longer survival (317 days vs 85 days, p:0.001). Procedural success 
and complication rates were found to be correlated with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our experience the SA represents a valid alternative 
to PTBD in the case of lymph node recurrence of gastric cancer, being favoured 
for patients with better performance status and longer life expectancy.

influence of expectancy and automation complacency on real-life emergency

Brake Reaction Time (BRT) is an important parameter for road safety. Previous 
research has shown that drivers' expectations can impact RT when facing 
hazardous situations, but driving with advanced driver assistance systems, can 
change the way BRT are considered. The interaction with a collision warning 
system can help faster more efficient responses, but at the same time can 
require a monitoring task and evaluation process that may lead to automation 
complacency. The aims of the present study are to test in a real-life setting 
whether automation compliancy can be generated by a collision warning system and 
what component of expectancy can impact the different tasks involved in an 
assisted BRT process. More specifically four component of expectancy were 
investigated: presence/absence of anticipatory information, previous direct 
experience, reliability of the device, and predictability of the hazard 
determined by repeated use of the warning system. Results supply indication on 
perception time and mental elaboration of the collision warning system alerts. 
In particular reliable warning quickened the decision making process, misleading 
warnings generated automation complacency slowing visual search for hazard 
detection, lack of directed experienced slowed the overall response while 
unexpected failure of the device lead to inattentional blindness and potential 
pseudo-accidents with surprise obstacle intrusion.

BACKGROUND: Demand for organs for transplant exceeds supply. There is an ongoing 
debate about the relative weighting that should be given to different allocation 
criteria. Little is known about the relative weight the community places on 
various allocation criteria. This study aims to determine community preferences 
for organ allocation.
METHODS: Community respondents recruited from a web-based panel chose which 
patient received a transplant in 30 scenarios presenting two hypothetical 
patients. Patients were described in age, sex, previous transplants, whether 
they or family were registered donors, had caring responsibilities, adherence, 
time on waiting list, estimated survival and quality of life (QOL) with and 
without transplant, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking. 
Analyses were conducted in NLOGIT 5.0, using a mixed-logit model.
RESULTS: Two thousand fifty-one respondents aged 18 to 83 years completed the 
survey. All attributes significantly influenced recipient choice except sex and 
having diabetes. Younger patients were preferred over older patients. Family 
member donor registration, having caring responsibilities, and longer time on 
waiting list increased priority. Pretransplant life expectancy was valued more 
highly than posttransplant life expectancy; 1 year less of pretransplant life 
expectancy required an increase of 1.49 years in posttransplant life expectancy 
to compensate. Posttransplant QOL was valued more highly than pretransplant QOL.
CONCLUSION: Lower pretransplant life expectancy (need) was more important than 
higher posttransplant life expectancy (utility). Although current allocation 
algorithms are consistent with community preferences for prioritizing children 
and time on the waiting list, favoring patients with high predicted 
posttransplant survival as potential recipients may not be aligned with 
community preferences.

Deciding when to stop cancer screening in older adults is a complex challenge 
that involves multiple factors: individual health status and life expectancy; 
risks and benefits of screening, which vary with age and comorbidity; and 
individual preferences and values. This article examines current cancer 
screening practices and reviews the risks and benefits of cancer screening for 
colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer, particularly in older 
individuals and those with multiple comorbidities. Tools for estimating life 
expectancy are reviewed, and a practical framework is presented to guide 
discussions on when the harms of screening likely outweigh the benefits.

PURPOSE: We examined the role of smoking in the two dimensions behind the time 
trends in adult mortality in European countries, that is, rectangularization of 
the survival curve (mortality compression) and longevity extension (increase in 
the age-at-death).
METHODS: Using data on national sex-specific populations aged 50 years and older 
from Denmark, Finland, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we studied trends in life 
expectancy, rectangularity, and longevity from 1950 to 2009 for both all-cause 
and nonsmoking-related mortality and correlated them with trends in lifetime 
smoking prevalence.
RESULTS: For all-cause mortality, rectangularization accelerated around 1980 
among men in all the countries studied, and more recently among women in Denmark 
and the United Kingdom. Trends in lifetime smoking prevalence correlated 
negatively with both rectangularization and longevity extension, but more 
negatively with rectangularization. For nonsmoking-related mortality, 
rectangularization among men did not accelerate around 1980. Among women, the 
differences between all-cause mortality and nonsmoking-related mortality were 
small, but larger for rectangularization than for longevity extension. 
Rectangularization contributed less to the increase in life expectancy than 
longevity extension, especially for nonsmoking-related mortality among men.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking affects rectangularization more than longevity extension, 
both among men and women.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Conventional OSA therapy necessitates 
indefinite continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Although CPAP is an 
effective treatment modality, up to 50% of OSA patients are intolerant of CPAP. 
We explore whether surgical modalities developed for those intolerant of CPAP 
are cost-effective.
METHODS: We construct a lifetime semi-Markov model of OSA that accounts for 
observed increased risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and motor vehicle 
collisions for a 50-year-old male with untreated severe OSA. Using this model, 
we compare the cost-effectiveness of (1) no treatment, (2) CPAP only, and (3) 
CPAP followed by surgery (either palatopharyngeal reconstructive surgery [PPRS] 
or multilevel surgery [MLS]) for those intolerant to CPAP.
RESULTS: Compared with the CPAP only strategy, CPAP followed by PPRS (CPAP-PPRS) 
adds 0.265 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for an increase of $2,767 
(discounted 2010 dollars) and is highly cost effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $10,421/QALY for a 50-year-old male with 
severe OSA. Compared to a CPAP-PPRS strategy, the CPAP-MLS strategy adds 0.07 
QALYs at an increase of $6,213 for an ICER of $84,199/QALY. The CPAP-PPRS 
strategy appears cost-effective over a wide range of parameter estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Palatopharyngeal reconstructive surgery appears cost-effective in 
middle-aged men with severe OSA intolerant of CPAP. Further research is 
warranted to better define surgical candidacy as well as short-term and 
long-term surgical outcomes.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder associated with a 
multitude of adverse outcomes when left untreated. There is significant 
heterogeneity in the evaluation and management of OSA resulting in variation in 
cost and outcomes. Thus, the goal for developing these measures was to have a 
way to evaluate the outcomes and reliability of the processes involved with the 
standard care approaches used in the diagnosis and management of OSA. The OSA 
quality care measures presented here focus on both outcomes and processes. The 
AASM commissioned the Adult OSA Quality Measures Workgroup to develop quality 
care measures aimed at optimizing care for adult patients with OSA. These 
quality care measures developed by the Adult OSA Quality Measures Workgroup are 
an extension of the original Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
approved Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) measures group for OSA. The 
measures are based on the available scientific evidence, focus on public safety, 
and strive to improve quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes for individual 
OSA patients. The three outcomes that were selected were as follows: (1) improve 
disease detection and categorization; (2) improve quality of life; and (3) 
reduce cardiovascular risk. After selecting these relevant outcomes, a total of 
ten process measures were chosen that could be applied and assessed for the 
purpose of accomplishing these outcomes. In the future, the measures described 
in this document may be reported through the PQRS in addition to, or as a 
replacement for, the current OSA measures group. The overall objective for the 
development of these measures is that implementation of these quality measures 
will result in improved patient outcomes, reduce the public health burden of 
OSA, and provide a measurable standard for evaluating and managing OSA.

BACKGROUND: Patients with organic acidurias (OAD) and urea cycle disorders (UCD) 
are at increased risk of disability, impaired quality of life and reduced life 
expectancy. Clinical care in any one centre is constrained by small patient 
numbers; and furthermore diagnostic and treatment strategies vary between 
metabolic centres and countries, resulting in significant inequalities and 
disparity in patient outcome.
AIMS/METHODS: The overall objective of the EU-funded activity 'European registry 
and network for intoxication type metabolic diseases' (E-IMD) is to collect 
systematic data to improve the knowledge of these diseases, to develop consensus 
care guidelines and to provide detailed information materials for families and 
professionals.
RESULTS: Within three years E-IMD has (1) established a network of 87 partners 
in 25 countries (2) set up a patient registry of more than 1,000 individuals 
with OAD and UCD, (3) launched a website ( www.e-imd.org ) including detailed 
information materials in 11 languages, (4) developed guidelines for OAD and UCD, 
(5) organised two teaching courses and various scientific meetings, (6) extended 
the IT platform clustering with other inherited metabolic diseases (IMD) and (7) 
strengthened the collaboration with other international scientific consortia.
CONCLUSIONS: E-IMD has made important steps towards improving and sharing 
knowledge on OAD and UCD and harmonisation of diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies. Through the establishment of a modular patient registry, clustering 
with other IMD and stepwise extension of the network, E-IMD has implemented the 
core components of a European Reference Network for rare diseases.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important factors mediating aging according to 
the free radical theory of aging. Few studies have systematically measured ROS 
levels in relationship to aging, partly due to the lack of tools for detection 
of specific ROS in live animals. By using the H₂O₂-specific fluorescence probe 
Peroxy Orange 1, we assayed the H₂O₂ levels of live Caenorhabditis elegans with 
41 aging-related genes being individually knocked down by RNAi. Knockdown of 14 
genes extends the lifespan but increases H₂O₂ level or shortens the lifespan but 
decreases H₂O₂ level, contradicting the free radical theory of aging. 
Strikingly, a significant inverse correlation between lifespan and the 
normalized standard deviation of H₂O₂ levels was observed (p < 0.0001). Such 
inverse correlation was also observed in worms cultured under heat shock 
conditions. An oxidative fluctuation hypothesis of aging is thus proposed and 
suggests that the ability of animals to homeostatically maintain the ROS levels 
within a narrow range is more important for lifespan extension than just 
minimizing the ROS levels though the latter still being crucial.

BACKGROUND: In 2012, WHO changed its recommendation for intermittent preventive 
treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) from two doses to monthly doses of 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during the second and third trimesters, but noted the 
importance of a cost-effectiveness analysis to lend support to the decision of 
policy makers. We therefore estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of IPTp 
with three or more (IPTp-SP3+) versus two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
(IPTp-SP2).
METHODS: For this analysis, we used data from a 2013 meta-analysis of seven 
studies in sub-Saharan Africa. We developed a decision tree model with a 
lifetime horizon. We analysed the base case from a societal perspective. We did 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses with appropriate parameter 
ranges and distributions for settings with low, moderate, and high background 
risk of low birthweight, and did a separate analysis for HIV-negative women. 
Parameters in the model were obtained for all countries included in the original 
meta-analysis. We did simulations in hypothetical cohorts of 1000 pregnant women 
receiving either IPTp-SP3+ or IPTp-SP2. We calculated disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) for low birthweight, severe to moderate anaemia, and clinical 
malaria. We calculated cost estimates from data obtained in observational 
studies, exit surveys, and from public procurement databases. We give financial 
and economic costs in constant 2012 US$. The main outcome measure was the 
incremental cost per DALY averted.
FINDINGS: The delivery of IPTp-SP3+ to 1000 pregnant women averted 113·4 DALYs 
at an incremental cost of $825·67 producing an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $7·28 per DALY averted. The results remained robust in the 
deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 
the ICER was $7·7 per DALY averted for moderate risk of low birthweight, $19·4 
per DALY averted for low risk, and $4·0 per DALY averted for high risk. The ICER 
for HIV-negative women was $6·2 per DALY averted.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings lend strong support to the WHO guidelines that 
recommend a monthly dose of IPTp-SP from the second trimester onwards.

BACKGROUND: Rwanda has achieved substantial progress in scaling up of 
antiretroviral therapy. We aimed to assess the effect of increased access to 
antiretroviral therapy on life expectancy among HIV-positive patients in two 
distinct periods of lower and higher antiretroviral therapy coverage (1997-2007 
and 2008-11).
METHODS: In a retrospective observational cohort study, we collected clinical 
and demographic data for all HIV-positive patients enrolled in care at 110 
health facilities across all five provinces of Rwanda. We included patients aged 
15 years or older with a known enrolment date between 1997 and 2014. We 
constructed abridged life tables from age-specific mortality rates and life 
expectancy stratified by sex, CD4 cell count, and WHO disease stage at enrolment 
in care and initiation of antiretroviral therapy.
FINDINGS: We included 72,061 patients in this study, contributing 213,983 
person-years of follow-up. The crude mortality rate was 33·4 deaths per 1000 
person-years (95% CI 32·7-34·2). Life expectancy for the overall cohort was 25·6 
additional years (95% CI 25·1-26·1) at 20 years of age and 23·3 additional years 
(95% CI 22·9-23·7) at 35 years of age. Life expectancy at 20 years of age in the 
period of 1997-2007 was 20·4 additional years (95% CI 19·5-21·3); for the period 
of 2008-11, life expectancy had increased to 25·6 additional years (95% CI 
24·8-26·4). Individuals enrolling in care with CD4 cell counts of 500 cells per 
μL or more, and with WHO disease stage I, had the highest life expectancies.
INTERPRETATION: This study adds to the growing body of evidence showing the 
benefit to HIV-positive patients of early enrolment in care and initiation of 
antiretroviral therapy.

Approximately 70,000 people are infected with hepatitis C virus in Hungary, and 
more than half of them are not aware of their infection. From the point of 
infected individuals early recognition and effective treatment of related liver 
injury may prevent consequent advanced liver diseases and complications (liver 
cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer) and can increase work productivity 
and life expectancy. Furthermore, these could from prevent further spread of the 
virus as well as reduce substantially long term financial burden of related 
morbidity, as a socioeconomic aspect. Pegylated interferon + ribavirin dual 
therapy, which is available in Hungary since 2003, can clear the virus in 40-45% 
of previously not treated (naïve), and in 5-21% of previous treatment-failure 
patients. Addition of a direct acting first generation protease inhibitor drug 
(boceprevir or telaprevir) to the dual therapy increases the chance of sustained 
viral response to 63-75% and 59-66%, respectively. These two protease inhibitors 
are available and financed for a segment of Hungarian patients since May 2013. 
Between 2013 and February 2015, other direct acting antivirals and 
interferon-free combination therapies have been registered for the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C with a potential efficacy over 90% and typically with a 
short duration of 8-12 weeks. Indication of therapy includes exclusion of 
contraindications to the drugs and demonstration of viral replication with 
consequent liver injury, i.e., inflammation and/or fibrosis in the liver. 
Non-invasive methods (elastography and biochemical methods) are accepted and 
preferred for staging liver damage (fibrosis). For initiation of treatment 
accurate and timely molecular biology tests are mandatory. Eligibility for 
treatment is a subject of individual central medical review. Due to budget 
limitations therapy is covered only for a proportion of patients by the National 
Health Insurance Fund. Priority is given to those with urgent need based on a 
Hungarian Priority Index system reflecting primarily the stage of liver disease, 
and considering also additional factors, i.e., activity and progression of liver 
disease, predictive factors of treatment and other special issues. Approved 
treatments are restricted to the most cost-effective combinations based on the 
cost per sustained viral response value in different patient categories with 
consensus between professional organizations, National Health Insurance Fund and 
patient organizations. More expensive therapies might be available upon 
co-financing by the patient or a third party. Interferon-free treatments and 
shorter therapy durations preferred as much as financially feasible. A separate 
budget is allocated to cover interferon-free treatments for the most-in-need 
interferon ineligible/intolerant patients, and for those who have no more 
interferon-based therapy option.

Publisher: Magyarországon 70000 egyén lehet fertőzött hepatitis C-vírussal, 
nagyobbik részük nem tud a fertőzöttségéről. A fertőzés időben történő 
felfedezése és meggyógyítása a beteg szempontjából a munkaképesség megőrzését, 
az életminőség javulását, a májzsugor és a májrák megelőzését, valamint a 
betegségmentes várható élettartam meghosszabbodását, míg a beteg környezete és a 
társadalom szempontjából a továbbfertőzés veszélyének megállítását, a későbbi 
súlyos májbetegségekből adódó egészségügyi ráfordításigény jelentős csökkenését 
eredményezi. A 2003 óta alkalmazott pegilált interferon+ribavirin kettős 
kezeléssel a hazánkban dominálóan 1-es genotípussal fertőzött, korábban 
terápiában nem részesült betegek 40–45%-a, a korábban sikertelenül kezeltek 
5–21%-a gyógyítható meg. 2011-ben a korábbiaknál lényegesen hatékonyabb, két új, 
direkt antivirális hatású proteázgátló szer került forgalomba (boceprevir és 
telaprevir). A készítmények – az előrehaladott stádiumban lévő májbeteg számára 
– 2013 májusa óta hazánkban is finanszírozottá váltak. 2013 és 2015. február 
között újabb direkt ható antivirális szerek kerültek törzskönyvezésre. Ezek 
kombinációival rövidebb időtartamú (8–24 hetes), 90% feletti gyógyulási arányt 
biztosító interferonmentes kezelés válik lehetővé. A kezelés indikációja – az 
ellenjavallatok kizárása után – a vírusnukleinsav és a májbetegség kimutatása. 
Utóbbit a gyulladásos aktivitás és/vagy a májfibrosis mértéke (stádium) 
határozza meg. A stádium meghatározására az invazív májbiopszia mellett a nem 
invazív elasztográfiás és validált biokémiai fibrosistesztmódszerek 
alkalmazhatók. A kivizsgálás és a kezelés során fontos a virológiai vizsgálatok 
gyors és megbízható elvégzése. Hazánkban az Egészségügyi Alapból történő kezelés 
engedélyezéshez kötött. A szakmailag indokolt kezelés finanszírozási korlátok 
miatt csak a betegek egy részénél kerül engedélyezésre. A sorrend alapja az 
úgynevezett Prioritási Index. Ez a májbetegség stádiuma mellett figyelembe veszi 
a betegség aktivitását, progresszióját, a kezelés sikerességének várható esélyét 
és további meghatározott speciális szempontokat is. Az egyes betegcsoportokban 
használható készítményeket az egy beteg meggyógyításához szükséges átlagos 
kezelési költség alapján a finanszírozóval egyeztetett, időszakosan aktualizált 
finanszírozási algoritmus határozza meg. A lehetőségek határai között előnyt 
élveznek a nagy hatékonyságú és biztonságos interferonmentes, illetve a rövidebb 
időtartamú kezelések. Az interferonalapú terápiára alkalmatlan betegek 
interferonmentes kezelése külön keretből, külön Prioritási Index alapján 
történik, a szóba jövő gyógyszerek költséghatékonyságának figyelembevételével.

INTRODUCTION: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a common, serious, and 
progressive complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is characterized by 
elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and 
mineral metabolism abnormalities. These disturbances may result in CKD-mineral 
and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), which is associated with poor quality of life and 
short life expectancy.
AREAS COVERED: The goal of SHPT treatment is to maintain PTH, calcium, and 
phosphorus within accepted targeted ranges. This review highlights the 
pathogenesis of SHPT and current SHPT therapeutic approaches, including the use 
of low-phosphate diets, phosphate binders, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) 
and its analogs, calcimimetics, and parathyroidectomy in addition to discussing 
emerging drugs in development for SHPT.
EXPERT OPINION: Numerous studies indicate that mineral abnormalities occur early 
in the course of CKD, are prevalent by the time patients enter dialysis, and 
foreshadow a risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Several newly 
developed compounds may potentially overcome the limitations of current SHPT 
therapies. If emerging therapies can reduce PTH, normalize mineral metabolism, 
promote treatment adherence, and reduce the risk of side effects, they may
