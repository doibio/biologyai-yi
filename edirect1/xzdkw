INTRODUCTION: Cemiplimab may significantly increase overall survival in the 
first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 
level of at least 50%. Therefore, there is a need to consider the 
cost-effectiveness of using this therapy for this indication.
METHODS: This Markov model was built to estimate the cost and effectiveness of 
cemiplimab vs. chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC based 
on the data from the EMPOWER-Lung 1 trial. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted 
LYs (QALYs) and lifetime costs were estimated. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty. 
Additional subgroup analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Treatment of advanced NSCLC with cemiplimab added 0.546 QALYs (1.492 
LYs) and resulted in an incremental cost of $22,069.804 compared with 
chemotherapy, which was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of $40,390.412 per QALY gained. The results of one-way sensitivity analysis 
found that the cost of cemiplimab was the most sensitive factor in our study. 
The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of cemiplimab 
being cost-effective was 100%. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that high 
PD-L1 expression (≥ 90%, > 60 to < 90% and ≥ 50 to ≤ 60%) also kept the 
incremental cost-effectiveness stable at $63,415.2450 per QALY, $61,896.446 per 
QALY and $-71,921.259 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of US payers, cemiplimab is cost-effective in 
the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC at the willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $150,000 per QALY.

Despite the evidence of links between health expenditure and health care 
efficiency, it is still unclear why countries with similar levels of health 
expenditures experience different outputs in terms of life expectancy at birth. 
Health care system efficiency might shed some light on the question. Using 
output-oriented data envelopment analysis, we compared the health systems of 140 
countries in terms of attained life expectancy. Efficiency is determined by the 
distance from the closest country on the best practice frontier, which 
identifies the highest attainable life expectancy observed for any given level 
of health care spending. By using national data form the Human Development Data, 
we built the efficiency frontier and computed the potential life expectancy 
increase for each country. The potential improvement was, on average, 5.47 years 
[95%CI: 4.71-6.27 years]. The least efficient countries (10th percentile of the 
efficiency score) could improve by 11.78 years, while the most efficient 
countries (90th percentile of the efficiency score) could only improve by 0.83 
years. We then analyzed, with regression analysis stratified by average 
education level, and by the role of health-related variables in differentiating 
efficient and inefficient countries from each other. The results suggest that, 
among countries with lower levels of education, decreasing unemployment and 
income inequality increases average life expectancy, without increasing health 
expenditure levels.

Priorities and Indicators for Economic Evaluation of Built Environment 
Interventions to Promote Physical Activity.

Cradock AL, Buchner D, Zaganjor H, Thomas JV, Sallis JF, Rose K, Meehan L, 
Lawson M, Lavinghouze R, Fenton M, Devlin HM, Carlson SA, Bhattacharya T, Fulton 
JE.

BACKGROUND: Built environment approaches to promoting physical activity can 
provide economic value to communities. How best to assess this value is 
uncertain. This study engaged experts to identify a set of key economic 
indicators useful for evaluation, research, and public health practice.
METHODS: Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary group of experts 
participated in (1) one of 5 discussion groups (n = 21 experts), (2) a 2-day 
facilitated workshop (n = 19 experts), and/or (3) online surveys (n = 16 
experts).
RESULTS: Experts identified 73 economic indicators, then used a 5-point scale to 
rate them on 3 properties: measurement quality, feasibility of use by a 
community, and influence on community decision making. Twenty-four indicators 
were highly rated (≥3.9 on all properties). The 10 highest-rated "key" 
indicators were walkability score, residential vacancy rate, housing 
affordability, property tax revenue, retail sales per square foot, number of 
small businesses, vehicle miles traveled per capita, employment, air quality, 
and life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: This study identified key economic indicators that could 
characterize the economic value of built environment approaches to promoting 
physical activity. Additional work could demonstrate the validity, feasibility, 
and usefulness of these key indicators, in particular to inform decisions about 
community design.

Universitário Lisboa Norte, Lisbon, Portugal.

Introduction:Periorbital ecchymoses or "raccoon eyes" in the neonate/infant may 
be due to basal skull fractures or neuroblastoma.Case Report:A term male baby 
born by vacuum-assisted delivery developed a medium size subgaleal hematoma on 
the first day of life (DOL). On the third DOL, bilateral periorbital ecchymosis 
(raccoon eyes) developed. The cerebral ultrasound, hematologic and coagulation 
studies were normal. The raccoon eyes were interpreted as an extension of the 
subgaleal hematoma to the orbital ridges. At DOL 38, he was thriving and the 
raccoon eyes were resolved.Discussion:"Raccoon eyes" may result from a subgaleal 
hematoma without fracture caused by birth trauma.

Comment in
    Value Health. 2022 Jun;25(6):1057-1058.

OBJECTIVES: This article aims to explore overlaps and differences between the 
emerging concept of value-based healthcare (VBHC) and the established field of 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), as well as the feasibility of integrating 
them together. Interest in VBHC has grown significantly in developed countries 
that seek to preserve the sustainability of their healthcare systems. 
Consequently, it is likely that VBHC will soon play a meaningful role in health 
economic policy and decision making. Because VBHC and CEA share many 
similarities, academics have pointed out that integration could lead to 
opportunities for improvements in both fields.
METHODS: An exploration of overlapping topics in VBHC and CEA literature was 
performed to establish initial links between them. A new methodologic approach 
is described to consolidate key value frameworks from the respective fields.
RESULTS: Several key themes emerged in which these 2 concepts can reinforce each 
other: interpretation of value, sensitivity to outcome changes, scientific 
credibility, methodology and measurement, and usability in decision making. 
Subsequently, an initial method is described of how the VBHC framework for value 
could be integrated into CEA through a so-called value-based healthcare 
quality-adjusted life year (VBHC-QALY).
CONCLUSION: This article introduces the existing VBHC value framework to the 
cornerstone of modern CEA and substantiates the presumption of health economists 
that valuable synergies arise from consolidating the individual strengths of CEA 
and VBHC. Through integration CEA can help establish robust methods for VBHC 
implementation, while the latter can complement the former with a new viewpoint 
and conceptual toolbox for patient centricity and the definition of value.

School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop a catalog of annual age- and medical 
condition-specific healthcare costs per capita among those who are living at a 
certain age (survivors) and the costs attributable to death itself for those who 
die at that age (decedents) in the United States. These estimates can be used to 
inform future cost calculations in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).
METHODS: We discussed a theoretical framework to incorporate futures costs in 
CEA. We used the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data 
to estimate costs among survivors and death costs. For survivors, we obtained 
cost estimates nonparametrically using kernel-based regression and locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing. We estimated costs attributable to death using 
inverse probability weights comparing decedents with appropriately weighted 
survivors at a given age after controlling for more than 270 clinical condition 
classifications, demographics, and interactions. Cost estimates were expressed 
in 2019 US dollar and also separately by sex and specific clinical conditions.
RESULTS: Average healthcare costs per capita among survivors, expectedly, rose 
over age from $2062 (95% confidence interval [CI] $1553-$2478) during the first 
year of life to $14 307 (95% CI $13 706-$14 956) at 85 years or older. Average 
costs of death were $44 569 (95% CI $14 304-$67 369) during the first year of 
life and declined by -$321 (95% CI -$620 to -$22) per 1 year older.
CONCLUSIONS: The US catalog of healthcare costs among survivors and decedents 
can facilitate calculations of future costs in CEA as recommended by the Second 
Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.

Think of the Children: A Discussion of the Rationale for and Implications of the 
Perspective Used for EQ-5D-Y Health State Valuation.

OBJECTIVES: The recently published EQ-5D-Y valuation protocol prescribes the 
general public values EQ-5D-Y health states for a 10-year-old child. This child 
perspective differs from the individual perspective applied for valuation of 
adult EQ-5D instruments. This article discusses the rationale for and 
implications of applying a child perspective for EQ-5D-Y health state valuation.
METHODS: This article was informed by an exploration of the normative and 
empirical literature on health state valuation. We identified and summarized key 
discussion points in a narrative review.
RESULTS: Although valuing EQ-5D-Y health states from an individual perspective 
is feasible, it may be problematic for several reasons. The use of a child 
perspective implies that-rather than valuing one's own health-someone else's 
health is valued. This may require the projection of one's own beliefs, 
expectations, and preferences on others, which could change the decision 
processes underlying the elicited preferences. Furthermore, because preferences 
are obtained for a 10-year-old child, it is unclear if this given age as well as 
other (missing) information on the described child beneficiary (should) affect 
valuation of EQ-5D-Y health states.
CONCLUSIONS: The change from an individual to a child perspective in the 
valuation of EQ-5D-Y will likely lead to differences in utilities. This has 
implications for the estimation of incremental health-related quality-of-life 
gains in economic evaluations of health technologies for children and 
adolescents and therefore might affect reimbursement decisions. Further research 
is necessary for gaining insight into the extent to which this impact is 
normatively and empirically justified.

Dismantling Anti-Ageing Medicine: Why Age-Relatedness of Cardiovascular Disease 
is Proof of Robustness Rather Than of Ageing-Associated Vulnerability.

Ageing is perceived to be the common culprit behind the most prevalent 
noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCD) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Treating ageing as a means to prevent its downstream pathologies has become the 
logical extension of this idea, and the defining criterion of anti-ageing 
medicine (evidence-based early detection, prevention, and treatment of 
age-related diseases). Challenging the underlying rationale, we here argue that 
the disease's late-in-life occurrence is proof of a genetically conserved 
robustness that helps us resist disease long enough for it to masquerade as a 
consequence of living long rather than of living wrong. Robustness is an 
acknowledged hallmark phenomenon of all complex systems (while there exists no 
universally adopted definition, a hallmark of complex systems is that they 
consist of many networked components whose interactions may give rise to system 
behaviours which cannot be derived or predicted from a reductionist knowledge of 
the interacting parts, even if this knowledge is complete) and a key concept in 
the complexity sciences (a relatively new branch of science that attempts to 
find and understand the common mechanisms and patterns shared by all complex 
systems). To reconceptualise the age-relatedness of chronic diseases in this 
sense has important implications for medical research and practice. The goal of 
our essay is to open a discussion that may enhance the overall understanding of 
robustness and prevent a misguided redirection of funding away from established 
disease specific research and towards anti-ageing medicine. This essay is 
timely, as the forthcoming 11th version of the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD) will be the first to recognise ageing as a condition, thereby 
legitimising anti-ageing medical research. On a more pragmatic note, and for the 
benefit of people alive today, we propose a practical strategy to remedy the 
mismatch between heritable robustness and the lifestyle challenges that 
gradually overwhelm it.

Successive earthquakes can drive landscape evolution. However, the mechanism and 
pace with which landscapes respond remain poorly understood. Offset channels in 
the Carrizo Plain, California, capture the fluvial response to lateral slip on 
the San Andreas Fault on millennial time scales. We developed and tested a model 
that quantifies competition between fault slip, which elongates channels, and 
aggradation, which causes channel infilling and, ultimately, abandonment. 
Validation of this model supports a transport-limited fluvial response and 
implies that measurements derived from present-day channel geometry are 
sufficient to quantify the rate of bedload transport relative to slip rate. 
Extension of the model identifies the threshold for which persistent change in 
transport capacity, obliquity in slip, or advected topography results in 
reorganization of the drainage network.

Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is a major pest species in 
numerous crops including hop (Humulus lupulus L.). Substantial T. urticae 
infestation was observed to occur in this recently introduced crop in Brazil. 
The adoption of less suitable cultivars to the pest species is highly desirable 
for integrated pest management. We used free-choice trials and two-sex life 
table analysis to determine the preference and population growth of T. urticae 
under laboratory conditions using three of hop cultivars currently expanding in 
Brazil (Mantiqueira, Victoria, and Yakima Gold). We also estimated the density 
of non-glandular trichomes and lupulin glands found on the abaxial leaf surface 
of these cultivars and correlated them with performance parameters of T. 
urticae. Mantiqueira appeared to be the least preferred by adult females for 
attractiveness and oviposition suggesting existence of antixenosis on this 
cultivar. Female immature stages developed slower on Yakima Gold and 
Mantiqueira, but no difference was observed between the latter and Victoria. 
Fecundity and longevity were significantly lower on Mantiqueira than on Victoria 
and Yakima Gold. No significant differences were observed among cultivars for 
intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), and net rate of 
reproduction (R0), suggesting the absence of antibiosis. Although, lupilin gland 
densities were higher on Mantiqueira and Yakima Gold than on Victoria, no 
significant correlations were observed between these defensive traits and 
performance parameters of T. urticae. However, 30-day population simulations of 
T. urticae suggest that Yakima Gold is the least susceptible, Mantiqueira is 
moderately susceptible, and Victoria is highly susceptible.

The First World Consensus Conference on Pancreas Transplantation provided 49 
jury deliberations regarding the impact of pancreas transplantation on the 
treatment of diabetic patients, and 110 experts' recommendations for the 
practice of pancreas transplantation. The main message from this consensus 
conference is that both simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) and 
pancreas transplantation alone can improve long-term patient survival, and all 
types of pancreas transplantation dramatically improve the quality of life of 
recipients. Pancreas transplantation may also improve the course of chronic 
complications of diabetes, depending on their severity. Therefore, the 
advantages of pancreas transplantation appear to clearly surpass potential 
disadvantages. Pancreas after kidney transplantation increases the risk of 
mortality only in the early period after transplantation, but is associated with 
improved life expectancy thereafter. Additionally, preemptive SPK, when compared 
to SPK performed in patients undergoing dialysis, appears to be associated with 
improved outcomes. Time on dialysis has negative prognostic implications in SPK 
recipients. Increased long-term survival, improvement in the course of diabetic 
complications, and amelioration of quality of life justify preferential 
allocation of kidney grafts to SPK recipients. Audience discussions and live

BACKGROUND: Introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been slow 
in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) because of resource 
constraints and worldwide shortage of vaccine supplies. To help inform WHO 
recommendations, we modelled various HPV vaccination strategies to examine the 
optimal use of limited vaccine supplies and best allocation of scarce resources 
in LMICs in the context of the WHO global call to eliminate cervical cancer as a 
public health problem.
METHODS: In this mathematical modelling analysis, we developed HPV-ADVISE LMIC, 
a transmission-dynamic model of HPV infection and diseases calibrated to four 
LMICs: India, Vietnam, Uganda, and Nigeria. For different vaccination strategies 
that encompassed use of a nine-valent vaccine (or a two-valent or four-valent 
vaccine assuming high cross-protection), we estimated three outcomes: reduction 
in the age-standardised rate of cervical cancer, number of doses needed to 
prevent one case of cervical cancer (NNV; as a measure of efficiency), and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; in 2017 international $ per 
disability-adjusted life-year [DALY] averted). We examined different vaccination 
strategies by varying the ages of routine HPV vaccination and number of age 
cohorts vaccinated, the population targeted, and the number of doses used. In 
our base case, we assumed 100% lifetime protection against HPV-16, HPV-18, 
HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58; vaccination coverage of 80%; and a 
time horizon of 100 years. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, we used a 3% 
discount rate. Elimination of cervical cancer was defined as an age-standardised 
incidence of less than four cases per 100 000 woman-years.
FINDINGS: We predicted that HPV vaccination could lead to cervical cancer 
elimination in Vietnam, India, and Nigeria, but not in Uganda. Compared with no 
vaccination, strategies that involved vaccinating girls aged 9-14 years with two 
doses were predicted to be the most efficient and cost-effective in all four 
LMICs. NNV ranged from 78 to 381 and ICER ranged from $28 per DALY averted to 
$1406 per DALY averted depending on the country. The most efficient and 
cost-effective strategies were routine vaccination of girls aged 14 years, with 
or without a later switch to routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years, and 
routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years with a 5-year extended interval 
between doses and a catch-up programme at age 14 years. Vaccinating boys (aged 
9-14 years) or women aged 18 years or older resulted in substantially higher 
NNVs and ICERs.
INTERPRETATION: We identified two strategies that could maximise efforts to 
prevent cervical cancer in LMICs given constraints on vaccine supplies and costs 
and that would allow a maximum of LMICs to introduce HPV vaccination.

Alzheimer's disease is a chronic lifestyle ailment whose occurrence has come to 
light with the increasing life expectancy due to better healthcare. The patient 
burden for AD is set to double by the year 2060 and advancement in research is 
of utmost importance to combat this problem. AD is characterized by the 
pathological hallmarks of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The 
disease has been implicated to have a genetic predisposition. The current 
treatment strategies are at best ameliorative in nature and offer no substantive 
cure. Immunotherapeutic approaches employed have shown few therapeutic benefits 
but the accelerated approval of aducanumab by the US-FDA shows clinical benefit 
merit. In addition, newer therapeutic approaches are the need of the hour. This 
review aims to highlight the pathology of the disease, followed by an insight 
into newer approaches like stem cell therapy and gene editing, focusing on 
possible CRISPR mediated targets.

There is an urgent need to identify new cellular targets to expand the 
repertoire, potency and safety of cancer therapeutics. Neonatal Fc Receptor 
(FcRn)-driven cellular recycling plays a predominant role in the prolonged serum 
half-life of human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) exploited in 
long-acting cancer drug designs. FcRn-mediated HSA and IgG uptake in epithelial 
cells and dendritic cell antigen presentation offers new therapeutic 
opportunities beyond half-life extension. Altered FcRn expression in solid 
tumours accounting for HSA catabolism or recycling supports a role for FcRn in 
tumour metabolism and growth. This review addresses the mechanistic basis for 
different FcRn expression profiles observed in cancer and exploitation for 
targeted drug delivery. Furthermore, the review highlights FcRn-mediated 
immunosurveillance and immune therapy. FcRn offers a potential attractive cancer 
target but in-depth understanding of role and expression profiles during cancer 
pathogenesis is required for tailoring targeted drug designs.

OBJECTIVE: The proportion of elderly patients with intracranial meningiomas is 
increasing as the life expectancy has improved. Increasing age is classically 
believed to be associated with higher perioperative morbidity and mortality in 
neurosurgical patients.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in 'PUBMED' and 'EMBASE' 
databases and reviewed all the studies comparing outcomes of surgery between 
young and elderly patients with intracranial meningiomas (IM). Data related to 
3-month mortality rates, length of hospital stay and complications, preoperative 
status and comorbidity, meningioma size, location, histology, peritumoral edema, 
and grade of excision were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirteen retrospective studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria out 
of the 893 reviewed articles. Pooled analysis showed that the 3-month mortality 
rate (4.65% versus 1.42%) and length of stay (10d versus 6.8d) for elderly 
patients were significantly higher as compared to the young population. The 
rates of cardio-respiratory complications (16.3% v/s 8.3%), intracranial 
hemorrhage (10.2% v/s 4.2%) and new-onset neurologic deficit (20.7% v/s 10.1%) 
were also significantly high in the elderly group as compared to the young 
patients. Moreover, a higher prevalence of associated comorbidities and poor 
performance score was noted in the elderly patients of IM.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality rate and rates of perioperative complications 
(cardio-respiratory, neurologic, intracranial hemorrhage) after surgery in 
elderly patients with IM patients are higher as compared to young patients and 
should be kept in mind when formulating treatment strategy for IM in this 
patient population.

OBJECTIVE: Historiography of South Asian mental asylums is generally skewed 
towards asylums operated by the British. The Lunatic asylum, Bengaluru, later to 
become NIMHANS, was one of the early asylums and was administered by a princely 
state (Mysore). This study aims to evaluate socio-demographic and clinical 
characteristics as well as the treatment outcome of patients admitted to the 
Lunatic Asylum, Bengaluru in the early 20th century (1903-1911).
METHODS: A review of inpatient registers at the Lunatic Asylum, Bengaluru was 
conducted for the years 1903-1911 and analysed using descriptive statistical 
methods.
RESULTS: There were 620 admissions during this period and three-fourths were men 
(n = 465, 75.0 %). The mean age of the patients was 32.09 ± 10.29 years at the 
time of admission. Acute mania (n = 209, 33.7 %), chronic mania (n = 125, 20.2 
%) and dementia (n = 65, 10.5 %) were the most frequent diagnoses. At the time 
of discharge, 35.5 % reported being cured and 12.1 % improved. The overall death 
rate of patients at the asylum was 27.2 %. Subjects who died had a mean duration 
of in-patient stay of 11.9 years. The mean age at death was 45.7 years with the 
comparable life-expectancy of the general population during the period being 
around 23 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In-patients in the Lunatic Asylum, Bengaluru in the 
pre-antipsychotic era had a good outcome with approximately 50 % being cured or 
showing improvement and longer life expectancy than the general population.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged life expectancy is associated with increased prevalence of 
chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the different 
disability trajectories for the top ten leading causes of death in Taiwan .
METHODS: A total of 2,431 participants aged 50-96 in 1996 from the Taiwan 
longitudinal study on aging (TLSA) who died from 1996 to 2016 were analyzed. 
Integration of Cause of Death Data and TLSA helped sort out participants who had 
died from the ten leading causes of death. The level of physical disability was 
evaluated with the Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLs), ranging from 0 to 6 
points, in 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011. A multilevel model was used to 
investigate the levels and rates of change in disability development before 
death.
RESULTS: The outcome of the research showed that the earliest group to 
experience physical limitation was individuals living with diabetes. The groups 
with the highest ADL scores were participants with diabetes, cerebrovascular 
disease, and hypertension-related diseases. Most groups reach ADL scores ≥ 1 
(mild-level) during 4-6 years before death except chronic hepatitis and 
cirrhosis and injury.
CONCLUSIONS: People who had died from the ten leading causes of death 
experienced different disability trajectories before death. The trajectory of 
the participants who had died from diabetes showed a unique pattern with the 
earliest occurrence and more severe deterioration in terms of development of 
disabilities. Disability trajectories provide a prediction of survival status 
for middle-aged and older adults associated with the ten leading causes of 
death.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: We estimated loss-of-life expectancy (LE) and lifetime 
medical expenditures (LME) stratified by stages to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of breast cancer (BC) screening in Taiwan.
METHODS: We interlinked four national databases- Cancer Registry, Mortality 
Registry, National Health Insurance Claim, and Mammography Screening. A cohort 
of 123,221 BC was identified during 2002-2015 and followed until December 31, 
2017. We estimated LE and loss-of-LE by rolling extrapolation algorithm using 
age-, sex-, and calendar-year-matched referents simulated from vital statistics. 
LME was estimated by multiplying monthly cost with survival probability and 
adjusted for annual discount rate. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) by comparing the loss-of-LE of those detected by screening versus 
non-screening after accounting for administration fees and radiation-related 
excess BC.
RESULTS: The LEs of stages I, II, III, and IV were 31.4, 27.2, 20.0, and 5.2 
years, respectively, while the loss-of-LEs were 1.2, 4.9, 11.7, and 25.0 years 
with corresponding LMEs of US$ 73,791, 79,496, 89,962, and 66,981, respectively. 
The difference in LE between stages I and IV was 26.2 years while that of 
loss-of-LE was 23.8 years, which implies that a potential lead time bias may 
exist if diagnosis at younger ages for earlier stages were not adjusted for. The 
ICER of mammography seemed cost-saving after the coverage exceeded half a 
million.
CONCLUSION: Mammography could detect BC early and be cost-saving after 
adjustment for different distributions of age and calendar year of diagnosis. 
Future studies exploring healthcare expenditure and impaired quality of life for 
false-positive cases are warranted.

Ambient temperature is an important contributor to mortality burden worldwide, 
most of which is from cold exposure. However, little is known about the cold 
impact on life expectancy loss. This paper aimed to estimate cold-related life 
expectancy loss from cause-, age-, and gender-specific cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases. Daily deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases 
and weather records were acquired for Hong Kong, China during 2000-2016. Years 
of life lost (YLL) that considers life expectancy at the time of death was 
calculated by matching each death by age and sex to annual life tables. Using a 
generalized additive model that fits temperature-YLL association, we estimated 
loss of years in life expectancy from cold. Cold was estimated to cause life 
expectancy loss of 0.9 years in total cardiovascular disease, with more years of 
loss in males than in females and in people aged 65 years and older than in 
people aged up to 64 years. Cold-related life expectancy loss in total 
respiratory diseases was 1.2 years, with more years of loss in females than in 
males and comparable years of loss in people aged up to 64 years and in people 
aged 65 years and older. Among cause-specific diseases, we observed the greatest 
life expectancy loss in pneumonia (1.5 years), followed by ischaemic heart 
disease (1.2 years), COPD (1.1 years), and stroke (0.3 years). Between two 
periods of 2000-2007 and 2008-2016, cold-related life expectancy loss due to 
cardiovascular disease did not decrease and cold-related life expectancy loss 
due to respiratory disease even increased by five times. Our findings suggest an 
urgent need to develop prevention measures against adverse cold effects on 
cardiorespiratory disease in Hong Kong.
