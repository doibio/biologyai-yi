INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to investigate whether morbidity 
in Canada, at the national and provincial levels, is compressing or expanding by 
tracking trends in life expectancy (LE) and health-adjusted life expectancy 
(HALE) from 1994 to 2010. "Compression" refers to a decrease in the proportion 
of life spent in an unhealthy state over time. It happens when HALE increases 
faster than LE. "Expansion" refers to an increase in the proportion of life 
spent in an unhealthy state that happens when HALE is stable or increases more 
slowly than LE.
METHODS: We estimated LE using mortality and population data from Statistics 
Canada. We took health-related quality of life (i.e. morbidity) data used to 
calculate HALE from the National Population Health Survey (1994-1999) and the 
Canadian Community Health Survey (2000-2010). We built abridged life tables for 
seven time intervals, covering the period 1994 to 2010 and corresponding to the 
year of each available survey cycle, for females and males, and for each of the 
10 Canadian provinces. National and provincial trends were assessed at birth, 
and at ages 20 years and 65 years.
RESULTS: We observed an overall average annual increase in HALE that was 
statistically significant in both Canadian females and males at each of the 
three ages assessed, with the exception of females at birth. At birth, HALE 
increased an average of 0.2% (p = .08) and 0.3% (p < .001) annually for females 
and males respectively over the 1994 to 2010 period. At the national level for 
all three age groups, we observed a statistically non-significant average annual 
increase in the proportion of life spent in an unhealthy state, with the 
exception of men at age 65, who experienced a non-significant decrease. At the 
provincial level at birth, we observed a significant increase in proportion of 
life spent in an unhealthy state for Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) and Prince 
Edward Island (PEI).
CONCLUSION: Our study did not detect a clear overall trend in compression or 
expansion of morbidity from 1994 to 2010 at the national level in Canada. 
However, our results suggested an expansion of morbidity in NL and PEI. Our 
study indicates the importance of continued tracking of the secular trends of 
life expectancy and HALE in Canada in order to verify the presence of 
compression or expansion of morbidity. Further study should be undertaken to 
understand what is driving the observed expansion of morbidity in NL and in PEI.

Publisher: INTRODUCTION: Notre étude visait à examiner s’il y a eu une expansion 
ou une compression de la morbidité au Canada, à l’échelle tant nationale que 
provinciale, en suivant l’évolution de l’espérance de vie (EV) et de l’espérance 
de vie ajustée en fonction de la santé (EVAS) entre 1994 et 2010. Une « 
compression », qui correspond à une diminution de la proportion de la vie 
marquée par des problèmes de santé, survient lorsque l’EVAS augmente plus 
rapidement que l’EV. Inversement, une « expansion », qui désigne une 
augmentation de la proportion de la vie marquée par des problèmes de santé, 
survient lorsque l’EVAS est stable ou augmente plus lentement que l’EV.
MÉTHODOLOGIE: Nous avons estimé l’EV à l’aide des données de Statistique Canada 
sur la mortalité et sur la population. Nous avons utilisé les données sur la 
qualité de vie liée à la santé (c. à d. morbidité) de l’Enquête nationale sur la 
santé de la population (1994 1999) et de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les 
collectivités canadiennes (2000 2010) pour calculer l’EVAS. Nous avons établi 
des tables de mortalité abrégées pour sept intervalles de temps correspondant 
aux cycles d’enquête disponibles durant la période de 1994 à 2010, ainsi que 
pour les deux sexes et les dix provinces canadiennes. Les tendances nationales 
et provinciales ont été examinées à la naissance, à 20 ans et à 65 ans.
RÉSULTATS: Dans l’ensemble, nous avons constaté une hausse annuelle moyenne 
statistiquement significative de l’EVAS chez les deux sexes aux trois âges 
évalués, sauf chez les nouveau nés de sexe féminin. L’EVAS à la naissance a 
augmenté en moyenne par année, entre 1994 et 2010, de 0,2 % (p = 0,08) chez les 
sujets de sexe féminin et de 0,3 % (p < 0,001) chez ceux de sexe masculin. À 
l’échelle nationale, les trois groupes d’âge ont présenté une augmentation 
annuelle moyenne non statistiquement significative de la proportion de la vie 
marquée par des problèmes de santé, sauf les hommes de 65 ans, qui ont présenté 
une diminution non significative. À l’échelle provinciale, nous avons observé 
une augmentation significative de la proportion de la vie marquée par des 
problèmes de santé à Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et à l’Île-du-Prince-Édouard.
CONCLUSION: Notre étude n’a fait ressortir aucune tendance générale nette 
indiquant une compression ou une expansion de la morbidité à l’échelle nationale 
au Canada entre 1994 et 2010. Nos résultats indiquent qu’il y a eu une expansion 
de la morbidité à Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et à l’Île-du-Prince-Édouard. L’étude 
a mis en évidence l’importance de continuer à suivre les tendances à long terme 
concernant l’EV et l’EVAS pour vérifier la présence d’une compression ou d’une 
expansion de la morbidité. D’autres études devraient être entreprises pour 
éclaircir les causes de l’expansion de la morbidité observée à 
Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador et à l’Île-du-Prince-Édouard.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in 
treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 (GT1) in the 
absence or mild fibrosis (F0-F1) versus advanced fibrosis (F2-F4), from the 
perspective of the Spanish Health System. A Markov model was developed to 
simulate disease progression, estimating costs and outcomes [life years gained 
(LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] derived from starting with LDV/SOF 
in patients with F0-F1 compared with F2-F4. Therapy duration was 8 weeks in 
noncirrhotic patients with viral load <6 million IU/mL and 12 weeks in the 
remaining patients. Sustained virologic response rates were obtained from 
real-world cohort studies. Transition probabilities, utilities and direct costs 
were obtained from the literature. A 3% annual discount rate was applied to 
costs and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed. LDV/SOF in F0-F1 
patients was a dominant strategy, being more effective (19.85 LYG and 19.80 
QALY) than beginning treatment in F2-F4 patients (18.63 LYG and 16.25 QALY), 
generating savings of €9228 per patient (€3661 due to disease management and 
monitoring). In a cohort of 1000 patients, LDV/SOF in F0-F1 patients decreased 
the number of cases of decompensated cirrhosis (93%), hepatocellular carcinoma 
(97%) and liver-related deaths (95%) and prevented 6 liver transplants compared 
to initiating LDV/SOF in F2-F4 patients. In CHC treatment-naïve GT1 patients, 
starting treatment with LDV/SOF in patients with F0-F1 compared to those with 
F2-F4 increases effectiveness by 1.22 LYG and 3.55 QALY gained and reduces 
disease burden and it is associated with cost savings.

CONTEXT: Bone metastases are a common complication in patients with advanced 
cancer but little is known regarding current practice patterns of palliative 
care providers when prescribing corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy for painful 
bone metastases.
OBJECTIVE: To identify current practice patterns among palliative care providers 
when prescribing corticosteroids for the treatment of painful bone metastases.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey of the membership of the American 
Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Providers were asked to report how 
frequently they prescribed corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy in patients with 
painful bone metastases, and to specify the corticosteroid, dosage, treatment 
duration, and the gastroprotective strategy most frequently utilized.
RESULTS: Seven hundred sixty-five participants responded to the survey and 600 
(78%) of respondents completed the survey. Ninety-eight percent of respondents 
completing the survey reported having prescribed corticosteroids as adjuvant 
pain therapy, and 66% ordered corticosteroids for the majority of their patients 
with painful bone metastases. Dexamethasone was the most widely prescribed 
corticosteroid. Eight milligrams divided twice daily was the most common dosage 
selected and once started, it was usually continued indefinitely.
CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed as adjuvant therapy in the 
treatment of painful bone metastases in patients with limited life expectancy. 
Dexamethasone is the most commonly selected corticosteroid by American 
palliative care providers with variation existing among providers regarding 
dosing schedule, treatment duration, and gastroprotective strategies. Clinical 
trials comparing a total daily dose of four versus eight milligrams of 
dexamethasone would be clinically useful to inform evidence-based practice.

BACKGROUND: Regional trade agreements are major international policy instruments 
that shape macro-economic and political systems. There is widespread debate as 
to whether and how these agreements pose risks to public health. Here we perform 
a comprehensive systematic review of quantitative studies of the health impact 
of trade and investment agreements. We identified studies from searches in 
PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Global Health Online. Research articles were 
eligible for inclusion if they were quantitative studies of the health impacts 
of trade and investment agreements or policy. We systematically reviewed study 
findings, evaluated quality using the Quality Assessment Tool from the Effective 
Public Health Practice Project, and performed network citation analysis to study 
disciplinary siloes.
RESULTS: Seventeen quantitative studies met our inclusion criteria. There was 
consistent evidence that implementing trade agreements was associated with 
increased consumption of processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Granting 
import licenses for patented drugs was associated with increased access to 
pharmaceuticals. Implementing trade agreements and associated policies was also 
correlated with higher cardiovascular disease incidence and higher Body Mass 
Index (BMI), whilst correlations with tobacco consumption, under-five mortality, 
maternal mortality, and life expectancy were inconclusive. Overall, the quality 
of studies is weak or moderately weak, and co-citation analysis revealed a 
relative isolation of public health from economics.
CONCLUSION: We identified limitations in existing studies which preclude 
definitive conclusions of the health impacts of regional trade and investment 
agreements. Few address unobserved confounding, and many possible consequences 
and mechanisms linking trade and investment agreements to health remain poorly 
understood. Results from our co-citation analysis suggest scope for greater 
interdisciplinary collaboration. Notwithstanding these limitations, our results 
find evidence that trade agreements pose some significant health risks. Health 
protections in trade and investment treaties may mitigate these impacts.

BACKGROUND: In a non-inferiority (NI) trial, analysis based on the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) principle is anti-conservative, so current guidelines 
recommend analysing on a per-protocol (PP) population in addition. However, PP 
analysis relies on the often implausible assumption of no confounders. 
Randomisation-based efficacy estimators (RBEEs) allow for treatment 
non-adherence while maintaining a comparison of randomised groups. Fischer et 
al. have developed an approach for estimating RBEEs in randomised trials with 
two active treatments, a common feature of NI trials. The aim of this paper was 
to demonstrate the use of RBEEs in NI trials using this approach, and to 
appraise the feasibility of these estimators as the primary analysis in NI 
trials.
METHODS: Two NI trials were used. One comparing two different dosing regimens 
for the maintenance of remission in people with ulcerative colitis (CODA), and 
the other comparing an orally administered treatment to an intravenously 
administered treatment in preventing skeletal-related events in patients with 
bone metastases from breast cancer (ZICE). Variables that predicted adherence in 
each of the trial arms, and were also independent of outcome, were sought in 
each of the studies. Structural mean models (SMMs) were fitted that conditioned 
on these variables, and the point estimates and confidence intervals compared to 
that found in the corresponding ITT and PP analyses.
RESULTS: In the CODA study, no variables were found that differentially 
predicted treatment adherence while remaining independent of outcome. The SMM, 
using standard methodology, moved the point estimate closer to 0 (no difference 
between arms) compared to the ITT and PP analyses, but the confidence interval 
was still within the NI margin, indicating that the conclusions drawn would 
remain the same. In the ZICE study, cognitive functioning as measured by the 
corresponding domain of the QLQ-C30, and use of chemotherapy at baseline were 
both differentially associated with adherence while remaining independent of 
outcome. However, while the SMM again moved the point estimate closer to 0, the 
confidence interval was wide, overlapping with any NI margin that could be 
justified.
CONCLUSION: Deriving RBEEs in NI trials with two active treatments can provide a 
randomisation-respecting estimate of treatment efficacy that accounts for 
treatment adherence, is straightforward to implement, but requires thorough 
planning during the design stage of the study to ensure that strong baseline 
predictors of treatment are captured. Extension of the approach to handle 
nonlinear outcome variables is also required.

OBJECTIVES: As a developing country, Iran is experiencing the increasing burden 
of cancers, which are currently the third leading cause of mortality in Iran. 
This study aims to demonstrate that cancer research in Iran concentrates on the 
cancer research priorities based on the global burden of disease (GBD) reports.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive evaluation of all cancers disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) was performed using GBD data. Also a comprehensive search was 
conducted using cancer-associated keywords to obtain all cancer-related 
publications from Iran, indexed in Web of Science.
METHOD: Multiple regression analysis and correlation coefficients (R2) were used 
to evaluate the possible associations between cancer research publications and 
GBD.
RESULTS: During 1996-2014, the majority of cancer-related publications in Iran 
focused on breast cancer, leukaemia and stomach cancer, respectively. This study 
found hypothetical correlations between cancer publications in Iran in line with 
the burden of cancer as reported by GBD. Particularly, correlations between 
years lived with disability (YLD) and cancer-related publications were more 
obvious.
CONCLUSION: This study introduces a new outline in setting cancer research 
priorities in the region.

Fish are generous sources for providing man with his essential nutritional 
requirements, but the extreme susceptibility to quality deterioration hinders 
their optimal usage and storage. Natural derivatives are always the perfect 
alternatives for food preservation. The application of fungal chitosan (Ch), 
from Aspergillus niger, and pomegranate peel extract (PPE), in coating films for 
Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets preservation ‎and maintaining their 
microbiological, chemical and sensorial quality during cooled storage at 4°C for 
30days, was investigated.‎ Fish fillet were coated with Ch (2%) and combined 
Ch+PPE, at PPE percentages of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0%. Fillets coating resulted 
in sharp decrease of the entire microbial counts during storage; the increased 
concentrations from PPE strengthened coating film antimicrobial activity. 
Additionally, fillets coating could retard the chemical spoilage parameters 
increasing, i.e. nitrogen volatile base (TVB-N), peroxide value (PV) and 
reactive substances of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS), during storage period. The 
sensory evaluation indicated higher preferences for the odor, texture, color and 
overall quality of coated samples. Fish fillets coating with Ch and Ch+PPE could 
be recommended for shelf life extension and maintaining the microbiological, 
chemical and sensorial quality through the application of safe preservatives 
from natural origins.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated temporal trends in stroke incidence between 
men and women to determine whether changes in the distribution of vascular risk 
factors have influenced sex differences in stroke epidemiology.
METHODS: Patients with first-ever stroke including ischemic stroke, spontaneous 
intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and undetermined stroke 
between 1987 and 2012 were identified through the population-based registry of 
Dijon, France. Incidence rates were calculated for age groups, sex, and stroke 
subtypes. Sex differences and temporal trends (according to 5-year time periods) 
were evaluated by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with Poisson 
regression.
RESULTS: Four thousand six hundred and fourteen patients with a first-ever 
stroke (53.1% women) were recorded. Incidence was lower in women than in men 
(112 versus 166 per 100 000/y; IRR, 0.68; P<0.001), especially in age group 45 
to 84 years, and for both ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. From 
1987 to 2012, the lower incidence of overall stroke in women was stable (IRR 
ranging between 0.63 and 0.72 according to study periods). When considering 
stroke subtype, a slight increase in the incidence of ischemic stroke was 
observed in both men (IRR, 1.011; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.016; P=0.001) 
and women (IRR, 1.013; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.018; P=0.001). The sex 
gap in incidence remained unchanged in ischemic stroke and intracerebral 
hemorrhage. Conversely, the lower subarachnoid hemorrhage incidence in women 
vanished with time because of an increasing incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: The sex gap in stroke incidence did not change with time except for 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite lower rates, more women than men experience an 
incident stroke each year because of a longer life expectancy.

AIM: To investigate the surgical therapies for gastric cancer (GC) patients of 
age 85 or older in a multicenter survey.
METHODS: Therapeutic opportunities for elderly GC patients have expanded in 
conjunction with extended life expectancy. However, the number of cases 
encountered in a single institution is usually very small and surgical therapies 
for elderly GC patients have not yet been standardized completely. In the 
present study, a total of 134 GC patients of age 85 or older who underwent 
surgery in 9 related facilities were retrospectively investigated. The 
relationships between surgical therapies and clinicopathological or prognostic 
features were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine of the patients (66%) presented with a comorbidity, and 26 
(19% overall) presented with more than two comorbidities. Radical 
lymphadenectomy was performed in 59 patients (44%), and no patient received pre- 
or post-operative chemotherapy. Forty of the patients (30%) experienced 
perioperative complications, but no surgical or perioperative mortality 
occurred. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in only 12 of the patients (9.0%). 
Univariate and multivariate analyses of the 113 patients who underwent R0 or R1 
resection identified the factors of pT3/4 and limited lymphadenectomy as 
predictive of worse prognosis (HR = 4.68, P = 0.02 and HR =2.19, P = 0.05, 
respectively). Non-cancer-specific death was more common in cStage I patients 
than in cStage II or III patients. Limited lymphadenectomy correlated with worse 
cancer-specific survival (P = 0.01), particularly in cStage II patients (P < 
0.01). There were no relationships between limited lymphadenectomy and any 
comorbidities, except for cerebrovascular disease (P = 0.07).
CONCLUSION: Non-cancer-specific death was not negligible, particularly in cStage 
I, and gastrectomy with radical lymphadenectomy appears to be an effective 
treatment for cStage II elderly GC patients.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a new treatment 
option for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Pre-TAVI procedure workup 
includes computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the heart and aorta from 
aortic annulus to the iliofemoral arteries. Frequently, there are a number of 
incidental non-cardiac findings (INCFs) in pre-TAVI CTA. However, the frequency 
and clinical significance of these INCFs are unknown. The aim of our study was 
to investigate the prevalence of INCFs and their clinical significance.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 67 patients who underwent dedicated 
pre-TAVI CTA from 2010 till 2015. Non-cardiovascular INCFs were classified 
according to their clinical significance into three categories. The first 
category includes findings that may require urgent treatment. The second 
category includes findings that need further follow-up. The third category 
includes incidental findings that require no further follow-up or 
recommendation.
RESULTS: The total number of patients was 67, and the mean age was 73 ± 8 years. 
All patients had INCFs and the total number was 248. Of the patients, 69% had 
chest findings, 85% had abdominal findings, and 33% had musculoskeletal 
findings. Results based on categorical classification were as follows: 9%, 25%, 
and 66% of these 248 findings belong to the first category, the second category, 
and the third category, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Non-cardiovascular INCFs are common in pre-TAVI CTA presumably due 
to increased age of such specific population. These findings have variable 
clinical significance and some of them might require acute treatment or 
additional evaluation, and should be managed properly taking into consideration 
patient's life expectancy and comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Due to an increased life expectancy in a healthy aging population 
and a progressive incidence of lung cancer, curative pulmonary resections can be 
performed even in octogenarians. The present study aims to investigate whether 
surgery is justified in patients reaching the age of 80 years and older who 
undergo resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: In this retrospective multi-centre analysis, the morbidity, mortality 
and long-term survival of 88 patients (24 females) aged ≥80 who underwent 
complete resection for lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 were analysed. Only fit 
patients with few comorbidities, low cardiopulmonary risk, good quality of life 
and a life expectancy of at least 5 years were included.
RESULTS: Curative resections from three thoracic surgery centres included 61 
lobectomies, 9 bilobectomies, 6 pneumonectomies and 12 segmentectomies or wide 
wedge resections with additional systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy in all 
cases. Final histology revealed squamous cell carcinoma [33], adenocarcinoma 
[41], large cell carcinoma [5] or other histological types [9]. Lung cancer 
stage distribution was 0 [1], I [53], II [17] and IIIA [14]. The overall 90-day 
mortality was 1.1%. The median hospitalisation and chest drainage times were 10 
days (range, 5-27 days) and 5 days (range, 0-17 days), respectively. Thirty-six 
patients were complication-free (41%). In particular, pulmonary complications 
occurred in 25 patients (28%). In addition, 23 patients (26%) developed 
cardiovascular complications requiring medical intervention, while 24 patients 
(27%) had cerebrovascular complications, urinary tract infection and others. The 
median survival time was 51 months (range, 1-110 months), and the 5-year overall 
survival reached 45% without significance between tumour stages.
CONCLUSIONS: Curative lung resections in selected octogenarians can be safely 
performed up to pneumonectomy for all tumour stages with a perioperative 
mortality, morbidity, and 5-year survival rate comparable to younger cohorts.

As the population ages due to demographic trends and gains in life expectancy, 
the incidence and prevalence of dementia increases, and the need to understand 
the etiology and pathogenesis of dementia becomes ever more urgent. Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a complex disease, the 
mechanisms of which are poorly understood. The more we learn about AD, the more 
questions are raised about our current conceptual models of disease. In the 
absence of a cure or the means by which to slow disease progress, it may be 
prudent to apply our current knowledge of the intersection between AD, 
cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease to foster efforts to delay 
or slow the onset of AD. This review discusses our current understanding of the 
epidemiology, genetics, and pathophysiology of AD, the intersection between AD 
and vascular causes of dementia, and proposes future directions for research and 
prevention.

Fracture liaison services (FLS) are advocated to improve osteoporosis treatment 
after fragility fracture, but there are few economic analyses of different 
models. A population-based 1i [=type C] FLS for non-hip fractures was 
implemented and it costs $44 per patient and it was very cost-effective ($9200 
per QALY gained). Small operational changes would convert it from cost-effective 
to cost-saving.
INTRODUCTION: After fragility fracture, <20% of patients receive osteoporosis 
treatment. FLS are recommended to address this deficit but there are very few 
economic analyses of different FLS models. Therefore, we conducted an economic 
analysis of a 1i (=type C) FLS called "Catch a Break (CaB)."
METHODS: CaB is a population-based FLS in Alberta, Canada, that case-finds older 
outpatients with non-traumatic upper extremity, spine, pelvis, or "other" 
non-hip fractures and provides telephonic outreach and printed educational 
materials to patients and their physicians. Cost-effectiveness was assessed 
using Markov decision-analytic models. Costs were expressed in 2014 Canadian 
dollars and effectiveness based on model simulations of recurrent fractures and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Perspective was healthcare payer; horizon 
was lifetime; and costs and benefits were discounted 3%.
RESULTS: Over 1 year, CaB enrolled 7323 outpatients (mean age 67 years, 75% 
female, 69% upper extremity) at average cost of $44 per patient. Compared with 
usual care, CaB increased rates of bisphosphonate treatment by 4.3 to 17.5% 
(p < 0.001). Over their lifetime, for every 10,000 patients enrolled in CaB, 4 
hip fractures (14 fractures total) would be avoided and 12 QALYs gained. 
Compared with usual care, incremental cost-effectiveness of CaB was estimated at 
$9200 per QALY. CaB was cost-effective in 85% of 10,000 probabilistic 
simulations. Sensitivity analyses showed if "other" fractures were excluded and 
intervention costs reduced 25% that CaB would become cost-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: A relatively inexpensive population-based 1i (=type C) FLS was 
implemented in Alberta and it was very cost-effective. If CaB excluded "other" 
fractures and decreased intervention costs by 25%, it would be cost-saving, as 
would any FLS that was more effective and less expensive.

In this paper we empirically investigate how to appropriately model utility of 
wealth and health. We use a recently proposed alternative approach to value 
willingness to pay (WTP) for health, making use of trade-offs between income and 
life years or quality of life, which we extend to allow for a more realistic 
multiplicative utility function over health and money. Moreover, we show how 
reference-dependency can be incorporated into this model and derive its 
predictions for WTP elicitation. We propose three experimental elicitation 
procedures and test these in a feasibility study, analysing the responses under 
different assumptions about the discount rate. Several interesting results are 
reported: first, the data are highly skewed, but if we trim the 5% lowest and 
highest values, we obtain plausible WTP estimates. Second, the results differ 
considerably between procedures, indicating that WTP estimates are sensitive to 
the assumed utility function. Third, respondents appear to be loss averse for 
both health and money, which is consistent with assumptions from prospect 
theory. Finally, our results also indicate that respondents are more willing to 
trade quality of life than life years.

Obesity with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m2 represents a significant risk 
for increased morbidity and mortality, with reduced life expectancy of about 10 
years. Until now, surgical treatment has been the only effective longterm 
intervention. The currently standardized method of bariatric surgery, gastric 
bypass, means that many gastrointestinal peptide hormones are activated, 
yielding net reductions in appetite and food intake. Among the most important 
gut peptide hormones in this perspective is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), 
which rises sharply after gastric bypass. Consistent with outcomes of this 
surgery, GLP-1 suppresses appetite and reduces food intake. This implies that 
GLP-1 has the potential to achieve a similar therapeutic outcome as gastric 
bypass. GLP-1 analogs, which are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, also lead to significant weight loss. Altered hormonal profiles after 
gastric bypass therefore indicate a logical connection between gut peptide 
hormone levels, weight loss and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, combinations 
of GLP-1 with other gut hormones such as peptide YY (PYY) and cholecystokinin 
(CCK) may be able to reinforce GLP-1 driven reduction in appetite and food 
intake. Pharmacological intenvention in obesity by use of GLP-1 analogs 
(exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, taspoglutide) 
and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) degradation that inactivate 
GLP-1 (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), leading to reduced appetite and weight with 
positive effects on metabolic control, are realistically achievable. This may be 
regarded as a low-risk therapeutic alternative to surgery for reducing 
obesity-related risk factors in the obese with lower BMIs.

People living with HIV (PLWH) who are treated with effective highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have a similar life expectancy to the general 
population. Moreover, an increasing proportion of new HIV diagnoses are made in 
people older than 50 y. The number of older HIV-infected patients is thus 
constantly growing and it is expected that by 2030 around 70% of PLWH will be 
more than 50 y old. On the other hand, HIV infection itself is responsible for 
accelerated immunosenescence, a progressive decline of immune system function in 
both the adaptive and the innate arm, which impairs the ability of an individual 
to respond to infections and to give rise to long-term immunity; furthermore, 
older patients tend to have a worse immunological response to HAART. In this 
review we focus on the pathogenesis of HIV-induced immunosenescence and on the 
clinical management of older HIV-infected patients.

The clinical landscape of advanced melanoma drastically changed after the 
introduction of both targeted therapies and immunotherapy. This rapid 
development in systemic therapies led to a change in the management of patients 
with brain metastases, with the subsequent need to re-assess the role of local 
therapies, in particular stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Areas covered: In this 
non-systematic review, we report on the current knowledge on the use of SRS in 
combination with immunotherapy and BRAF/MEK inhibitors for patients with 
melanoma brain metastases, as well as ongoing trials in this field. Expert 
commentary: It is now more common to observe patients with melanoma brain 
metastases with better performance status and prolonged life expectancy. A 
combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, in different sequences, has 
been shown to be feasible and well tolerable, on the basis of retrospective 
reports. Additional data from ongoing prospective trials are however needed to 
confirm or not these findings and better explore the efficacy of the 
combination.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term health benefits and risks of adding vorapaxar 
(VOR) to the standard care antiplatelet therapy (SC) of aspirin and/or 
clopidogrel, among a population with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and/or 
peripheral artery disease (PAD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a state-transition model, patients transition 
between health states (event-free, recurrent MI, stroke, death), while at risk 
of experiencing non-transition-related revascularization and non-fatal bleeding 
events. Risk equations developed from the TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 trial's patient-level 
data were used to predict cardiovascular (CV) outcomes over longer time 
horizons. Additional sources, including trials and US-based observational 
studies, informed the inputs for short-term CV risk, non-CV death, and 
health-related quality of life. Survival and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
were estimated over a lifetime horizon, discounted at 3% per year.
RESULTS: Within a cohort of 7361 patients with recent MI and/or PAD, VOR + SC 
relative to SC alone yielded 176 fewer CV events (MIs, strokes, or CV deaths), 
but 27 more major bleeding events. VOR + SC was associated with increased life 
expectancy and health benefits (19.93 undiscounted life-years [LYs], 9.57 
discounted QALYs vs. 19.61 undiscounted LYs, 9.41 discounted QALYs). The results 
were most sensitive to scenarios varying time of vorapaxar initiation, and the 
assumptions in the 90 day period post-MI. Additional analyses showed that add-on 
vorapaxar provides consistent incremental benefits in high-risk subgroups.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the growing literature on secondary 
prevention add-on therapy, as results from these modeling analyses suggest that 
adding vorapaxar to SC for patients at high atherothrombotic risk can provide 
long-term health benefits.

As an endangered animal group, mossy frog (genus Theloderma) has attracted the 
attention of biologists and wildlife conservationists. Clarifying the taxonomic 
status and distribution of each species in Theloderma is important to determine 
the conservation status for each species, establish appropriate conservation 
strategies and probe the speciation process. Recently, we discovered a 
medium-sized species of mossy frog of the genus Theloderma in April 2015 during 
municipal surveys of amphibians in Dayao Mountain of Jinxiu. It was collected 
from the water-filled tree cavities. However, there remains some uncertainty 
about the species determination of the mossy frog in the Yinshan station of 
Dayao Mountain in Guangxi Province, China. Previously, the mossy frog in Guangxi 
Province was recognized as Th. kwangsiense. In order to clarify the species 
status of the mossy frog obtained from Guangxi, we sequenced 2414 bp of the 12S 
and 16S genes in the sample collected from the Dayao Mountain. Combining all the 
sequence in NCBI, genetic analyses from the data suggest that the sample from 
the Dayao Mountain is Th. corticale rather than Th. kwangsiense. It is most 
likely that the most previous studies had wrong species identification. And, it 
is the first time we use DNA barcoding to prove that the species obtained from 
Guangxi is a new distribution of Th. corticale.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition is common in care home residents, but 
information on the cost-effectiveness of nutritional interventions is lacking. 
This study, involving a randomised trial in care home residents, aimed to 
examine whether oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are cost-effective relative 
to dietary advice.
METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken prospectively 
in 104 older care home residents (88 ± 8 years) without overt dementia, who were 
randomised to receive either ONS or dietary advice for 12 weeks. Costs were 
estimated from resource use and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) from 
health-related quality of life, assessed using EuroQoL (EQ-5D-3L, 
time-trade-off) and mortality. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
was calculated using 'intention to treat' and 'complete case' analyses.
RESULTS: The ONS group gained significantly more QALYs than the dietary advice 
group at significantly greater costs. The ICER (extra cost per QALY gained), 
adjusted for nutritional status, type of care, baseline costs and quality of 
life, was found to be £10,961 using the 'intention to treat' analysis (£190.60 
(cost)/0.0174 (QALYs); n = 104) and £11,875 using 'complete case' analysis 
(£217.30/0.0183; n = 76) (2016 prices). Sensitivity analysis based on 'intention 
to treat' data indicated an 83% probability that the ICER was ≤£20,000 and 92%
