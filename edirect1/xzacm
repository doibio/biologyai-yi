METHODS: The medical record, including the intraoperative anesthesia records, 
operative notes, progress notes, discharge summary, clinic notes, and radiology 
studies and reports, was reviewed.
RESULTS: The patient developed signs of central cord syndrome after total hip 
arthroplasty. Despite nonoperative intervention, including physiotherapy, the 
patient's upper and lower extremity weakness continued. Magnetic resonance 
imaging revealed evidence of cervical cord compression, and the patient 
underwent a cervical laminectomy, which produced mild improvement in his 
symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: To avoid life-altering complications, it is important to evaluate 
the cervical spine (especially in the elderly), avoid neck extension during 
intubation, and use careful airway management in patients with suspected 
stenosis/spondylosis.

Rap2 is required for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in Xenopus early 
development.

Technology, Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea.

The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is critical for the establishment of 
organizer and embryonic body axis in Xenopus development. Here, we present 
evidence that Xenopus Rap2, a member of Ras GTPase family, is implicated in 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during the dorsoventral axis specification. Ectopic 
expression of XRap2 can lead to neural induction without mesoderm 
differentiation. XRap2 dorsalizes ventral tissues, inducing axis duplication, 
organizer-specific gene expression and convergent extension movements. Knockdown 
of XRap2 causes ventralized phenotypes including shortened body axis and 
defective dorsoanterior patterning, which are associated with aberrant Wnt 
signaling. In line with this, XRap2 depletion inhibits beta-catenin 
stabilization and the induction of ectopic dorsal axis and Wnt-responsive genes 
caused by XWnt8, Dsh or beta-catenin, but has no effect on the signaling 
activities of a stabilized beta-catenin. Its knockdown also disrupts the 
vesicular localization of Dsh, thereby inhibiting Dsh-mediated beta-catenin 
stabilization and the membrane recruitment and phosphorylation of Dsh by 
frizzled signaling. Taking together, we suggest that XRap2 is involved in 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling as a modulator of the subcellular localization of 
Dsh.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a distributed version of 
constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).
DESIGN: Within-subjects control intervention study.
SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation center.
PARTICIPANTS: Eleven persons with chronic stroke. All had active extension of at 
least 20 degrees at the wrist and at least 10 degrees for each finger of the 
more-affected hand.
INTERVENTIONS: Intensive motor training of the more-affected arm for 3 hours a 
day for 20 days; restraint of the other arm for 9.3 hours daily to limit its 
use. This intervention provides the same amount of training as provided in the 
conventional CIMT therapy protocol (60 h) but distributes training time over 
twice the number of days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Real-world (Motor Activity Log) and laboratory motor 
activity (Wolf Motor Function Test, Frenchay Arm Test, Nine Hole Peg Test), 
strength (grip force) and spasticity (Ashworth Scale), and quality of life (QOL; 
Stroke Impact Scale) were assessed.
RESULTS: Participants showed significant improvements in more-affected arm 
real-world motor activity, laboratory motor activity, strength and spasticity, 
as well as in some aspects of QOL, up to 6 months after treatment ( P .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Distributed CIMT is a promising intervention for improving motor 
function and QOL in patients with chronic stroke.

in dogs.

OBJECTIVE: To describe effects of lifetime food restriction on causes of death 
and the association between body-mass characteristics and time of death in dogs.
DESIGN: Paired-feeding study.
ANIMALS: 48 dogs from 7 litters.
PROCEDURES: Dogs were paired, and 1 dog in each pair was fed 25% less food than 
its pair mate from 8 weeks of age until death. Numerous morphometric and 
physiologic measures were obtained at various intervals throughout life. 
Associations of feeding group to time and causes of death were evaluated, along 
with important associated factors such as body composition components and 
insulin-glucose responses.
RESULTS: Median life span was significantly longer for the group that was fed 
25% less food, whereas causes of death were generally similar between the 2 
feeding groups. High body-fat mass and declining lean mass significantly 
predicted death 1 year prior to death, and lean body composition was associated 
with metabolic responses that appeared to be integrally involved in health and 
longevity.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results were similar to results of diet 
restriction studies in rodents and primates, reflecting delayed death from 
species- and strain-specific intrinsic causes. Clinicians should be aware that 
unplanned body mass changes during mid- and later life of dogs may indicate the 
need for thorough clinical evaluation.

Clinical outcomes of septoplasty and inferior turbinate reduction in the 
geriatric veterans' population.

Busaba NY(1), Hossain M.

Author information:
(1)VA Boston HealthCare System, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

BACKGROUND: Patients older than 65 years constitute an increasingly large 
percentage of the patient population that presents to an adult otolaryngology 
practice due to the increase in life expectancy. The objective of this study is 
to assess the clinical outcomes of septoplasty with or without inferior 
turbinate reduction in patients who are 65 years or older.
METHODS: This is a prospective nonrandomized longitudinal study of 40 patients 
aged 65 years or more and who underwent septoplasty with or without inferior 
turbinate reduction. Patients received Nasal Health Survey (NHS) and General 
Health Status Short Form (SF-12) questionnaires before and 6 months after 
surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test.
RESULTS: The preoperative NHS score was 52.3, while the postoperative score was 
76.6 (p < 0.001). The reported benefit reflected improvement in symptoms (p < 
0.001) and reduction in medication usage (p < 0.001). In addition, the SF-12 
score improved after the surgery but the difference did not reach statistical 
significance (p = 0.055).
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Septoplasty and inferior turbinate reduction is 
beneficial in the veterans' population for patients 65 years or older who 
present with nasal obstruction and are noted on physical examination to have 
septal deviation and inferior turbinate hypertrophy.

Colorectal cancer screening in Australia: an economic evaluation of a potential 
biennial screening program using faecal occult blood tests.

of Human Services, Melborne, Victoria. christine.stone@dhs.vic.gov.au

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the introduction of a national, co-ordinated 
screening program using the faecal occult blood test represents 
'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government as 
third-party funder.
METHODS: The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a biennial screening 
program in 'steady-state' operation were estimated for the Australian population 
using 1996 as the reference year. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the 
years of life lost (YLLs) averted, and the health service costs were modelled, 
based on the epidemiology and the costs of colorectal cancer in Australia 
together with the mortality reduction achieved in randomised controlled trials. 
Uncertainty in the model was examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods.
RESULTS: We estimate a minimum or 'base program' of screening those aged 55 to 
69 years could avert 250 deaths per annum (95% uncertainty interval 99-400), at 
a gross cost of dollarsA55 million (95% UI dollarsA46 million to dollarsA96 
million) and a gross incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dollarsA17,000/DALY 
(95% UI dollarsA13,000/DALY to dollarsA52,000/DALY). Extending the program to 
include 70 to 74-year-olds is a more effective option (cheaper and higher health 
gain) than including the 50 to 54-year-olds.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study support the case for a national program 
directed at the 55 to 69-year-old age group with extension to 70 to 74-year-olds 
if there are sufficient resources. The pilot tests recently announced in 
Australia provide an important opportunity to consider the age range for 
screening and the sources of uncertainty, identified in the modelled evaluation, 
to assist decisions on implementing a full national program.

Standard expected years of life lost as a measure of mortality: norms and 
reference to New Zealand data.

Marshall RJ(1).

Author information:

University of Auckland, New Zealand. rj.marshall@auckland.ac.nz

OBJECTIVES: Standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) is a component of the 
disability adjusted life year (DALY) measure of disease burden. SEYLL is 
calculated from the expected remaining years, as specified by a normative 
survivorship that is derived from a model life table. Because every death has 
non-zero remaining years, years of life lost are never zero, even in a 
population that achieves the ideal life expectancy of the model life table 
itself. As zero is unattainable, what is an acceptable years of life lost? The 
study calculates norms and examines NZ data against them.
METHOD: Using model life tables with expectancy 80 years for men and 82.5 years 
for women, the years of life lost in cohorts that achieve the model life table 
expectancy are evaluated. Years of life lost per death and per head of 
population are considered and the effects of age-standardising, discounting and 
age-weighting are evaluated. Mortality and Census data are used to compute 
actual years of life lost in New Zealand, which are compared with the norms.
RESULTS: Crude years of life lost per death is about 9-10 years in a population 
that achieves the model life table distribution. New Zealand European years of 
life lost are about five years in excess of the 9-10 year norm; Maori about 21 
years. The effects of age standardising, using the Segi standard population, 
give a norm of about 21 years; both Maori and European values are about two 
years in excess of this figure.
CONCLUSIONS: Crude and age-standardised YLLs in New Zealand exceed the ideal set 
by the model life tables norms, especially so in Maori. Age-standardising has a 
strong influence on the statistics.
IMPLICATIONS: Years of life lost measures need to be considered against the 
established norms. Unless done so, the measures can appear more adverse than 
they actually are.

Different quantitative measures of the impact of premature deaths on the 
community in Australia.

OBJECTIVE: Different quantitative measures based on the concept of years of 
potential life lost have been derived for assessing the burden of diseases and 
injuries. However, few studies have been conducted to compare the usefulness of 
these measures in terms of providing practical information. This study aims to 
examine the utility of different measures in assessing the impact of premature 
deaths on Australian society.
METHODS: This population-based study was conducted utilising data on the 
underlying causes of death officially reported by the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics. The mortality rates, potential years of life lost (PYLL), 
potentially productive years of life lost (PPYLL), and the valued potential 
years of life lost (VPYLL), are calculated and compared for deaths due to all 
known underlying causes.
RESULTS: In comparison with other causes of death, injury deaths had the 
second-highest annual rates of PYLL (1,206.7 years), the highest PPYLL (543.5 
years), and VPYLL (489.7 years). Premature deaths due to injury were the only 
positively valued VPYLL among all major causes of death. Among injury deaths, 
intentional injury deaths caused the largest VPYLL (7,591.6 years), with a 
higher rate than unintentional injury deaths.
CONCLUSION: As an indicator of the economic impact and burden of premature 
deaths to society, the VPYLL seems to be an advantageous utility. Injury poses 
the greatest public health problem to the Australian economy.

[Effect of temperature and food concentration on the population dynamics of 
three Brachionus calyciflorus strains].

[Article in Chinese]

Biological Resource in Anhui, College of Life Science, Anhui Normal University, 
Wuhu 241000, China. kinddongli@163.com

Effects of temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C) and food 
concentration (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0 x 10(6) cells x ml(-1)) on the population 
dynamics of Brachionus calyciflorus of Qingdao, Wuhu and Guangzhou strains were 
studied by means of individual culture. The result showed that the temperature 
was an important factor affecting generation time and intrinsic rate of 
population increase. With rising of temperature, the intrinsic rate of 
population increase increased, but generation time decreased. There were 
significant effects of food concentration on life expectancy and average 
lifespan. The effect of strain on net reproductive rate, generation time, life 
expectancy and average lifespan was also significant. Net reproductive rate, 
generation time, life expectancy, and average lifespan of Guangzhou strain was 
all the maximum, and that of Wuhu strain minimum among the three strains. The 
rotifers fed on the algae at the concentration of 3.0 x 10(6) cells x ml(-1) had 
the longest life expectancy and average lifespan, but those at 9.0 x 10(6) cells 
x ml(-1) had the shortest. Net reproductive rate, generation time, gross 
reproductive rate, life expectancy, and average lifespan of the three strains 
decreased linearly with the rise of temperature, except for the net reproductive 
rate of Guangzhou strain, while the intrinsic rate of population increase of all 
the three strains and gross reproductive rate of Guangzhou strain increased 
linearly with the rise of temperature. The relationships between all the life 
history parameters of Qingdao and Guangzhou strains and food concentration were 
all curvilinear, however, those between generation time, average lifespan, and 
life expectancy of Wuhu strain and food concentration could all be described by 
linear regression.

AIM: To explore pain relief interventions used by older people with chronic pain 
in Hong Kong. The frequency and perceived effectiveness of non-prescription 
measures were also explored.
BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, the incidence of chronic illness 
and chronic pain also increases. Chronic pain robs older people of their quality 
of life.
DESIGN: This was a descriptive qualitative study.
RESULTS: Forty-four older people (37 female and seven male) who were residents 
of a nursing home in Hong Kong took part in this study. Their ages ranged from 
65 to 82 years, median age was 75 years. Almost 80% had experienced moderate to 
severe pain during the previous three months. The most common sites of pain were 
muscles and joints; 35% of subjects reported continuous pain, 27% reported pain 
associated with activities of daily living, and 38% reported pain during 
exercise but not at rest. Only a few of the study group had taken prescribed 
medication to relieve pain, and only two of the 44 subjects studied had used a 
combination of drug and non-prescription intervention for pain relief. The 
majority of participants used non-prescription intervention only and the most 
commonly used were topical analgesics with massage. The majority (58%) of the 
subjects perceived the used of non-prescription intervention to be very 
effective in pain relief.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pain was found to be high among older people in 
this study. Yet, they were taking a pro-active and responsible role in treating 
their chronic pain by using non-pharmacological patient-initiated intervention; 
also older people perceive themselves to have control over their pain status.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This active role of older people in their pain 
relief is likely to enhance the effect of education seminars and workshops aimed 
at novel, non-pharmacological pain relief strategies for older people with 
chronic pain.

Cholesterol-producing transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans lives longer due to 
newly acquired enhanced stress resistance.

Because Caenorhabditis elegans lacks several components of the de novo sterol 
biosynthetic pathway, it requires sterol as an essential nutrient. Supplemented 
cholesterol undergoes extensive enzymatic modification in C. elegans to form 
other sterols of unknown function. 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR) 
catalyzes the reduction of the Delta7 double bond of sterols and is suspected to 
be defective in C. elegans, in which the major endogenous sterol is 
7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC). We microinjected a human DHCR expression vector 
into C. elegans, which was then incorporated into chromosome by gamma-radiation. 
This transgenic C. elegans was named cholegans, i.e., cholesterol-producing C. 
elegans, because it was able to convert 7DHC into cholesterol. We investigated 
the effects of changes in sterol composition on longevity and stress resistance 
by examining brood size, mean life span, UV resistance, and thermotolerance. 
Cholegans contained 80% more cholesterol than the wild-type control. The brood 
size of cholegans was reduced by 40% compared to the wild-type control, although 
the growth rate was not significantly changed. The mean life span of cholegans 
was increased up to 131% in sterol-deficient medium as compared to wild-type. 
The biochemical basis for life span extension of cholegans appears to partly 
result from its acquired resistance against both UV irradiation and thermal 
stress.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the independent risk factors for intravesical tumor 
recurrence in patients with primary transitional cell carcinoma of the upper 
urinary tract, and to develop a risk-stratification model to allow more accurate 
prediction of recurrence risk.
METHODS: Of 141 patients who underwent total nephroureterectomy for clinically 
localized transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, the data from 
89 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a previous history or 
concomitance of bladder cancer and/or a follow-up period of less than 1 year 
were excluded from this study. Multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional 
hazards model was used to determine independent risk factors for intravesical 
tumor recurrence.
RESULTS: Of 89 patients, 37 (41.6%) experienced subsequent intravesical tumor 
recurrence during a median follow-up period of 39.7 months (range 12.0 to 
186.6). On multivariate analysis, tumor multiplicity, pathologic stage, tumor 
size, and surgical modality had a statistically significant impact on the risk 
of intravesical tumor recurrence (P = 0.0075, P = 0.0221, P = 0.0377, and P = 
0.0413, respectively). Pathologic stage and tumor size were inversely correlated 
to the risk. A scoring system for the risk of intravesical recurrence was 
developed from the proposed prognostic factors, and the patients were stratified 
into three groups according to their scores, with statistically significant 
prognostic differences between them (P = 0.0018).
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor multiplicity, pathologic stage, tumor size, and surgical 
modality all had a significant impact on the incidence of intravesical tumor 
recurrence. A risk stratification model constructed from tumor biologic factors 
may be useful in the follow-up of patients with transitional cell carcinoma of 
the upper urinary tract.

Prognostic role of prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume for the risk of 
invasive therapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia initially managed 
with alpha1-blockers and watchful waiting.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic role of prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) level and prostate volume (PV) for the need for benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH)-related invasive therapy among patients initially treated with 
an alpha1-blocker or watchful waiting (WW) in real-life clinical practice.
METHODS: Data were collected from 2264 consecutive patients with clinical BPH. 
Patients initially treated with an alpha1-blocker or WW were included in this 
study. They were stratified by baseline PSA level (less than 1.5, 1.5 to less 
than 3.0, 3.0 to 10.0 ng/mL) and PV (less than 30 and 30 to 200 cm3), and 
analyzed for the time to BPH-related invasive therapy.
RESULTS: Of the 2264 patients, 389 treated with alpha1-blockers and 553 who 
chose WW were included. Across the PSA and PV strata, the alpha1-blocker group 
had worse symptoms, peak flow, postvoid residual urine volumes, and obstruction 
than did the WW group. Increasing PSA levels produced an increase in the 5-year 
cumulative risk of invasive treatment: 20%, 34%, and 44% in the alpha1-blocker 
and 8%, 9%, and 15% in the WW group for a PSA level of less than 1.5, 1.5 to 
less than 3.0, and 3.0 to 10.0 ng/mL, respectively. The hazard ratio for the 
highest compared with the lowest PSA strata was 2.8 for alpha1-blocker and 2.7 
for WW patients. An increasing PV increased the 5-year cumulative risk from 21% 
to 35% in the alpha1-blocker group and 8% to 11% in the WW group. The hazard 
ratio for the large versus small prostates in the alpha1-blocker group was 1.8 
and in the WW group was 1.0.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher PSA level and larger PV resulted in a greater risk of 
BPH-related invasive therapy that was more pronounced in the alpha1-blocker than 
in the WW patients. However, symptom severity, flow parameters, and obstruction 
grade may have contributed to the difference in risk between the two treatment 
groups.

Does prior benign prostate biopsy predict outcome for patients treated with 
radical perineal prostatectomy?

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the 
surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal 
prostatectomy for prostate cancer.
METHODS: A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer 
underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A 
subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign 
prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital 
rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients 
with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, 
patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of 
recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or 
greater.
RESULTS: Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic 
features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P <0.001) and less 
margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study 
group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of 
biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior 
benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for 
those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P <0.01). Overall, 
patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of 
biochemical failure compared with those in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with 
more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional 
studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Cataract, opacification of the lens, is one of the commonest causes of loss of 
useful vision, with an estimated 16 million people worldwide affected. Several 
risk factors have been identified in addition to increasing age--genetic 
composition, exposure to ultraviolet light, and diabetes. However, no method to 
halt the formation of a cataractous lens has been shown to be effective. 
Nevertheless, advances in surgical removal of cataracts, including 
small-incision surgery, use of viscoelastics, and the development of intraocular 
lenses, have made treatment very effective and visual recovery rapid in most 
cases. Despite these advances, cataract continues to be a leading public-health 
issue that will grow in importance as the population increases and life 
expectancy is extended worldwide.

PURPOSE: To examine the accuracy of survival prediction by palliative radiation 
oncologists.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: After consultation of cancer patients with metastatic 
disease for referral of palliative radiotherapy, radiation oncologists estimated 
the survival of the patients. These were compared with the actual dates of death 
obtained from the Cancer Death Registry. The time to death from all causes was 
the outcome. The survival times were measured from the date of the first 
consultation at the palliative radiotherapy clinics.
RESULTS: Six radiation oncologists provided estimates for 739 patients. Of the 
739 patients, 396 were men and 343 were women (median age, 69 years). The median 
survival of all patients was 15.9 weeks. The mean difference between the actual 
survival (AS) and the clinician predicted survival (i.e., actual survival minus 
clinician predicted survival) was -12.3 weeks (95% confidence interval, -15.0 to 
-9.5) for the entire population. The mean difference was -21.9 weeks when the 
actual survival was < or =12 weeks, -19.2 weeks when the AS was 13-26 weeks, 
-9.7 weeks when the AS was 27-52 weeks, and +23.0 weeks when the AS was >52 
weeks.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the prediction of survival by radiation oncologists 
was inaccurate and tended to be overly optimistic.

DAF-2 pathway mutations and food restriction in aging Caenorhabditis elegans 
differentially affect metabolism.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, metabolism and life expectancy respond to 
environmental cues of food availability and temperature. Several genes act in a 
neuroendocrine, DAF-2, insulin/IGF-1 receptor-like pathway in which reduced 
signaling affects metabolism and increases longevity. Here we describe the 
effect of reduced DAF-2 signaling on several parameters of metabolism including 
rates of oxygen consumption and heat output, the calorimetric/respirometric 
ratio, ATP levels, XTT reduction capacity and accumulation of lipofuscin. We 
also asked whether the DAF-2 signaling pathway mediates the metabolic and 
longevity effects of axenic culture medium. We show that both interventions act 
either antagonistically or in concert, depending on the parameter examined and 
that axenic culture medium, unlike DAF-2 signaling, does not need DAF-16 for 
generating these effects. In addition, we provide evidence that DAF-2 signaling 
controls mitochondrial bioenergetics by adjusting the rate of ATP synthesis to 
the rate of ATP utilization and by regulating the heat-producing proton leak 
pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of combination treatment with 
etanercept plus methotrexate in comparison with monotherapies in patients with 
active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using a new model that incorporates both 
functional status and disease activity.
METHODS: Effectiveness data were based on a 2 year trial in 682 patients with 
active RA (TEMPO). Data on resource consumption and utility related to function 
and disease activity were obtained from a survey of 616 patients in Sweden. A 
Markov model was constructed with five states according to functional status 
(Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)) subdivided into high and low disease 
activity. The cost for each quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained was 
estimated by Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: Disease activity had a highly significant effect on utilities, 
independently of HAQ. For resource consumption, only HAQ was a significant 
predictor, with the exception of sick leave. Compared with methotrexate alone, 
etanercept plus methotrexate over 2 years increased total costs by 14,221 euros 
and led to a QALY gain of 0.38. When treatment was continued for 10 years, 
incremental costs were 42,148 euros for a QALY gain of 0.91. The cost per QALY 
gained was 37,331 euros and 46,494 euros, respectively. The probability that the 
cost effectiveness ratio is below a threshold of 50,000 euros/QALY is 88%.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating the influence of disease activity into this new model 
allows better assessment of the effects of anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment 
on patients' general wellbeing. In this analysis, the cost per QALY gained with 
combination treatment with etanercept plus methotrexate compared with 
methotrexate alone falls within the acceptable range.

Intraoral neurilemmoma is rare (only 1%), and the most common form is a 
unilobular tumor on the dorsum of the tongue in the patients in the 2nd and 3rd 
decades of life. Herein we describe the case of intraoral neurilemmoma in a 
9-year-old girl complaining only of a sore throat. She had an exophytic 
multilobulated mass on the base of the tongue. MR imaging demonstrates the 
extension of the tumor and helps in the differential diagnosis. The signal 
intensity of the tumor is similar to that of neurilemmomas in the other sites.

The St. Louis Carotid Occlusion Study demonstrated that ipsilateral increased O2 
extraction fraction (OEF) (Stage II hemodynamic failure) measured by positron 
emission tomography (PET) is a powerful independent risk factor for subsequent 
stroke in patients with symptomatic complete carotid artery (CA) occlusion. The 
ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate at 2 years has been shown to be 5.3% in 42 
patients with normal OEF and 26.5% in 39 patients with increased OEF (p = 
0.004). In patients in whom hemispheric symptoms developed within 120 days, the 
2-year ipsilateral stroke rates were 12% in 27 patients with normal OEF and 50% 
in 18 patients with increased OEF. Previous PET studies have demonstrated that 
anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery (STA) to a middle cerebral artery 
(MCA) cortical branch can restore OEF to normal. The authors discuss the 
undertaking of a study that will test the hypothesis that STA-MCA anastomosis, 
when combined with the best medical therapy, can reduce ipsilateral ischemic 
stroke by 40% at 2 years in patients with symptomatic internal CA occlusion and 
Stage II hemodynamic failure occurring within 120 days after surgery. Only 
patients with increased OEF distal to a symptomatic occluded CA will be 
randomized to surgery or medical treatment. The primary endpoint will be all 
strokes and death occurring between randomization and the 30-day postoperative 
cut off (with an equivalent period in the nonsurgical group), as well as 
subsequent ipsilateral ischemic stroke developing within 2 years. It is 
estimated that 186 patients will be required in each group. Assuming that 40% of 
PET scans will demonstrate increased OEF, this will require enrolling 930 
clinically eligible individuals.

Of 76 clients receiving 8-20 sessions of cognitive therapy (CT) in a joint 
university and a national health service clinic, 31 experienced sudden gains 
that appeared very similar to those first reported in clinical trials of CT by 
T. Z. Tang and R. J. DeRubeis (1999) and subsequently replicated in other 
studies. The sudden gains appeared less stable in the present study's more 
routine clinical practice settings than they were in the clinical trials. Life 
events did not appear to account for sudden gains.

Pharmacotherapy of osteoporosis in men.

Diamond TH(1).

Australia. terrydiamond@optushome.com.au

Osteofragility fractures occur in men due to a compromise in bone strength, 
coupled with either trauma or a fall. In men >or= 65years of age, osteoporosis 
can be defined as bone mineral density (at the proximal femur, spine or distal 
forearm) of 2.5 standard deviations or less below the mean for a normal young 
adult man, using a male reference database (i.e., T-score value of <or=-2.5) 
[1,2]. In men 50 - 65 years of age, a similar definition is used if other risk 
factors for a fracture are present. Osteoporosis is increasingly recognised in 
men [3-11]. One in three men aged > 60 years will suffer an osteoporotic 
fracture [3]. Spinal fractures occur in 5% of men (compared with 16% of women) 
and hip fractures in 6% of men (compared with 18% of women) > 50 years of age 
[8]. The risk of hip fracture increases by approximately 2.6-fold for each 
standard deviation decrease in bone density measured at the hip [12,13]. At 
present, the life expectancy for men has increased to a mean age of 76.8 years. 
With men now living longer, they can be expected to develop multiple coexisting 
illnesses contributing to bone loss and an increased likelihood of falling and 
fragility fractures [5,14,15]. It is estimated that 30 - 60% of men presenting 
with spinal fractures have another illness contributing to their bone disease 
[4,6-10,16-20]. The ideal therapy for men with osteoporosis should include an 
intervention which significantly increases bone strength and reduces fracture 
rates, is safe, easy to administer and economical. This review outlines the 
current treatment strategies available for men with osteoporosis.

Rheumatoid disease and the heart: from epidemiology to echocardiography.

Bhatia GS(1), Sosin MD, Grindulis KA, Davis RC, Lip GY.

(1)University Department of Medicine, City Hospital, Birmingham, B18 7QH, UK.

Rheumatoid disease (RD) is a common chronic inflammatory condition associated 
with progressive joint destruction. Sufferers of RD experience reduced life 
expectancy, reflected in the increased standardised mortality rates reported in 
several studies over the last 50 years. Most studies indicate that the increased 
mortality affecting this population is mainly due to cardio-vascular disease. 
Epidemiological data have revealed an increased risk of developing ischaemic 
heart disease and heart failure in RD. The increased risk of ischaemic heart 
disease may result from traditional risk factors but data suggest that RD may 
confer risk independently. Although pericardial involvement, valvopathy and 
myocarditis are the most well-recognised cardiac manifestations of RD, and 
constitute a rheumatoid heart disease, these features are relatively benign. The 
current prevalence of rheumatoid heart disease in the era of early 
administration of disease-modifying therapy requires evaluation.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: As life expectancy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients improves, 
end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation (LT) may become an 
emerging problem. We report the Paul Brousse Hospital experience of 
transplantation for end stage cirrhosis in HIV-HCV co-infected patients.
METHODS: Seven consecutive HIV-HCV co-infected patients were transplanted 
between December 1999 and December 2002 for end stage liver disease due to HCV. 
All patients were treated by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV 
plasma viral load was <400 copies/ml and median CD4 lymphocyte count was 306 
cells/mm3 (range, 103-510) before LT. At the time of evaluation (March 2003), 
the median follow-up was 21 months (range, 4-40).
RESULTS: Two patients died, 4 and 22 months, respectively after LT. At the last 
biopsy, METAVIR score was staged F4 in two patients, F3 in two, and F1 in one. 
Microvesicular steatosis was noted in nearly all patients. The ratio of 
mitochondrial to nuclear DNA was low in three of four patients examined as 
compared with the amount of liver mtDNA found in eight HIV-negative, 
HCV-infected controls (P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant defect in the activity of the respiratory chain 
complex IV was noted in all five patients studied. Mitochondrial hepatotoxicity 
and severe HCV recurrence occur in HIV-HCV co-infected patients after LT.

Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis abundance and prevalence 
data, for domestic dogs of Shiqu County, Sichuan Province, People's Republic of 
China, were fitted to mathematical models to evaluate transmission parameters. 
Abundance models, assuming the presence and absence of immunity, were fit for 
both E. granulosus and E. multilocularis using Bayesian priors, maximum 
likelihood, and Monte Carlo sampling techniques. When the models were compared, 
using the likelihood ratio test for nested models, the model assuming the 
presence of immunity was the best fit for E. granulosus infection, with a 
purgation based prevalence of 8% (true prevalence interval of 8-19% based on the 
sensitivity of purgation) and a mean abundance of 80 parasites per dog, with an 
average infection pressure of 560 parasites per year. In contrast, the model 
assuming the absence of immunity was the best fit for E. multilocularis 
infection, with a purgation based prevalence of 12% (true prevalence interval of 
13-33% based on the sensitivity of purgation) and a mean abundance of 131 
parasites per dog, with an average infection pressure of 334 or 533 parasites 
per year assuming a 5 or 3 month parasite life expectancy, respectively. The 
prevalence data for both parasites was then fit to a set of differential 
equations modeling the transition between infection states in order to determine 
number of infectious insults per year. Infection pressure was 0.21, with a 95% 
credibility interval of 0.12 to 0.41, infections per year for E. granulosus and 
0.52, with a 95% credibility interval of 0.29-0.77, infections per year for E. 
multilocularis assuming a 5 month parasite lifespan or 0.85, with a 95% 
credibility interval of 0.47-1.25 infections per year, assuming a 3 month E. 
multilocularis lifespan in dogs.

BACKGROUND: Nursing homes (NHs) are less well studied than hospices or hospitals 
as a setting for terminal care. For more targeted palliative care, more 
information is needed about the patient characteristics, symptoms, direct causes 
and underlying diseases, and incidence of terminally ill NH patients. These 
aspects are examined in this study.
METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study in 16 NHs representative of the 
Netherlands. All long-term care patients assessed by an NH physician to have a 
life expectancy of 6 weeks or less were enrolled in our study.
RESULTS: The terminal disease phase was marked with symptoms of low fluid and 
food intake, general weakness, and respiratory problems or dyspnea. Direct 
causes of these conditions were diseases of the respiratory system (mainly 
pneumonia) and general disorders (eg, cachexia). The 2 main underlying diseases 
of the terminal phase were mental and behavioral disorders and diseases of the 
circulatory system. Cancer was the underlying disease in only 12% of the 
patients. Patients with cancer showed a different pattern of symptoms than those 
without cancer. Per 100 beds per year, 34 NH patients entered the terminal 
phase. Most patients (82.9%) died within 7 days of inclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients without cancer in Dutch NHs, the terminal disease 
phase is difficult to predict, and once diagnosed, patient survival time is 
short. A better identification of the symptom burden might improve the 
prognostication of life expectancy in elderly patients.
