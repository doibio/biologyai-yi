remain undiagnosed until complications (e.g. stroke) manifest. Risk-prediction 
algorithms may help to efficiently identify people with undiagnosed AF. However, 
the cost-effectiveness of targeted screening remains uncertain. This study aimed 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of targeted screening, informed by a machine 
learning (ML) risk prediction algorithm, to identify patients with AF.Methods: 
Cost-effectiveness analyses were undertaken utilizing a hybrid screening 
decision tree and Markov disease progression model. Costs and outcomes 
associated with the detection of AF compared traditional systematic and 
opportunistic AF screening strategies to targeted screening informed by a ML 
risk prediction algorithm. Model analyses were based on adults ≥50 years and 
adopted the UK NHS perspective.Results: Targeted screening using the ML risk 
prediction algorithm required fewer patients to be screened (61 per 1,000 
patients, compared to 534 and 687 patients in the systematic and opportunistic 
strategies) and detected more AF cases (11 per 1,000 patients, compared to 6 and 
8 AF cases in the systematic and opportunistic screening strategies). The 
targeted approach demonstrated cost-effectiveness under base case settings (cost 
per QALY gained of £4,847 and £5,544 against systematic and opportunistic 
screening respectively). The targeted screening strategy was predicted to 
provide an additional 3.40 and 2.05 QALYs per 1,000 patients screened versus 
systematic and opportunistic strategies. The targeted screening strategy 
remained cost-effective in all scenarios evaluated.Limitations: The analysis 
relied on assumptions that include the extended period of patient life span and 
the lack of consideration for treatment discontinuations/switching, as well as 
the assumption that the ML risk-prediction algorithm will identify asymptomatic 
AF.Conclusions: Targeted screening using a ML risk prediction algorithm has the 
potential to enhance the clinical and cost-effectiveness of AF screening, 
improving health outcomes through efficient use of limited healthcare resources.

AIM: The purpose of the study was to compare the results of using compression 
knitwear and elastic bandaging in the postoperative period after endovasal laser 
coagulation in patients with varicose veins.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of forty 20-to-55-year-old women with a body mass 
index of ≤ 35 kg/m2 and CEAP class C2-C3 lower limb varicose veins were 
randomized into two numerically equal groups. The Study Group included those 
receiving postoperative compression on the operated leg with the help an elastic 
stocking, whereas in the Comparison Group compression was achieved by laying an 
elastic bandage. Both group women underwent laser coagulation of the great 
saphenous vein and removal of separate veins with the help of Mueller hooks. 
Efficacy of compression therapy was comparatively assessed based on the results 
of interviewing the patients prior to intervention and 1 month thereafter, as 
well as by the level of pain syndrome according to the visual analogue scale at 
24 and 48 postoperative hours, by the time spent by the personnel for bandaging 
of the limb or putting on the compression stocking intraoperatively and at the 
first dressing, by the degree of lower limb oedema and dynamics of regression 
thereof, by the area of postoperative haematoma and its dynamics after 2, 7 days 
and at 1 month. Besides, we evaluated the findings of ultrasonographic 
angioscanning of lower limb veins at one month postoperatively.
RESULTS: The obtained findings demonstrated that efficacy of using a medical 
compression stocking after the procedure of endovasal laser coagulation in women 
with varicose veins was comparable to that of elastic bandaging. By the 
incidence rate and area of extension of postoperative haematomas, degree of pain 
syndrome, patient-oriented assessment using the Chronic Venous Insufficiency 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ), condition of veins according to the 
findings of ultrasonographic angioscanning no significant differences were 
revealed between the two methods of elastic compression of the leg. However, 
using a medical stocking appeared to promote a statistically significant 
1.4-1.6-fold reduction in the time spent for formation of elastic compression of 
the lower limb, as well as a decrease in the incidence rate and degree of local 
oedema of the lower limb in the postoperative period.

Publisher: Цель исследования: сравнить результаты применения компрессионного 
трикотажа и эластического бинтования в послеоперационном периоде при 
эндовазальной лазерной коагуляции у пациентов с варикозной болезнью. Объект 
исследования: 40 пациентов женского пола в возрасте 20-55 лет, с индексом массы 
тела до 35 кг/м2, с варикозным расширением вен нижних конечностей С2-С3 (по 
СЕАР), которые случайным образом распределены в 2 равные по объему группы. В 
основную группу включены пациенты с компрессией после вмешательства на 
оперированной нижней конечности с помощью эластического чулка, в группе 
сравнения компрессия осуществлялась эластическим бинтом. В двух группах 
проводилась лазерная коагуляция большой подкожной вены и удаление отдельных вен 
с помощью крючков Мюллера. Сравнительную оценку эффективности компрессионной 
терапии проводили по результатам анкетирования пациентов до операции и через 1 
месяц после вмешательства, а также по уровню болевого синдрома согласно 
визуальной аналоговой шкале через 24 и 48 часов после операции; по времени, 
затраченному у персонала на бинтование конечности или надевание компрессионного 
чулка интраоперационно и на первой перевязке; по выраженности отека нижней 
конечности и динамике его регресса; по площади послеоперационной гематомы и ее 
динамики через 2, 7 суток и 1 месяц. Кроме того, оценивали данные 
ультразвукового ангиосканирования вен нижних конечностей через 1 месяц после 
операции. Результаты исследования показали, что применение медицинского 
компрессионного чулка при проведении процедуры эндовазальной лазерной коагуляции 
у пациентов с варикозной болезнью по эффективности сопоставимо с эластическим 
бинтованием. По частоте возникновения и площади распространения 
послеоперационных гематом, выраженности болевого синдрома, 
пациент-ориентированной оценки по опроснику качества жизни CIVIQ, состоянию вен 
по данным ультразвукового ангиосканирования не выявлено значимых отличий между 
двумя методами эластической компрессии конечности. В то же время использование 
медицинского чулка способствует статистически значимому уменьшению времени в 
1,4-1,6 раза на формирование эластической компрессии нижней конечности, снижению 
частоты и выраженности локального отека нижней конечности в послеоперационном 
периоде.

BACKGROUND: IMpower 133 trial first confirmed the efficacy and safety of adding 
atezolizumab or placebo to first-line treatment with chemotherapy in patients 
with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). While, overprice limited its 
broad use in clinical. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in treatment of extensive 
SCLC as first line in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was established by extracting data from the IMpower 133 
trial with untreated extensive SCLC patients. Utility values were obtained from 
published studies, and the costs were acquired from real world and literature. 
Additionally, sensitivity analyses based on a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
were performed to identify the uncertain parameters of Markov model.
RESULTS: Total costs of atezolizumab group were $48,129, while cost of 
chemotherapy alone was just $12,920 in placebo group. The quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) in atezolizumab group was just 0.072 higher than that in 
placebo group (0.858 QALYs vs. 0.786 QALYs). The cost-effectiveness ratio 
between atezolizumab combination with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone was 
$489,013/QALY in China. The net benefit of placebo group was significantly 
higher than atezolizumab group. One-way sensitivity analyses highlighted that 
utilities of the progression-free survival (PFS) and progression disease state 
in placebo group were the most influential parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab combination therapy was not more cost-effective than 
chemotherapy alone at a WTP threshold of $25,929/QALY in China.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disorder, affecting adults, with multiple 
nodules, typically on the limbs. The treatment is challenging, especially in 
elderly patients. An 85-year-old woman had developed in the last 3 years itch 
with nodular lesions and erythematous scaly patches and excoriations. The 
extension of the lesions was evaluated by body surface area (BSA) score and the 
patient's itch and disease-related sleep disorders by a Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS) from 0 to 10. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and blood 
chemistry were performed before and during the therapy. At the baseline, the BSA 
score was 56%. Itch and disease-related sleep disorders were, respectively, NRS 
10 and 5 and DLQI was 9. Total IgE count and lactate dehydrogenase were 
increased. After starting dupilumab, there was a rapid improvement, especially 
in pruritus. The patient reported the maximum peak of pruritus every day for 6 
months. At this time, the itch almost disappeared and clinically only 
postinflammatory lesions appreciated, with normalization of the blood tests and 
without any side effects.

If Australia is to successfully eliminate hepatitis B as a public health threat, 
it will need to enhance the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) care cascade. This study 
used a Markov model to assess the impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of scaling 
up CHB diagnosis, linkage to care and treatment to reach national and 
international elimination targets for hepatitis B in Australia. Compared to 
continued current trends, the model calculated the difference in care cascade 
projection, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), costs and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), of scaling up CHB diagnosis, linkage to care 
and treatment to reach: (a) Australia's 2022 national targets and (b) the WHO's 
2030 global targets. Achieving the national and WHO targets had ICERs of 
A$13 435 (A$10 236-A$21 165) and A$14 482 (A$13 031-A$25 641) per DALY averted 
between 2016 and 2030 in Australia, respectively. However, this excluded 
implementation and demand generation costs. The ICER for the National Strategy 
and WHO Strategy remained under A$50 000 per DALY averted if Australia spent up 
to A$328 or A$538 million, respectively, per annum (for 2016-2030) on 
implementation and demand generation activities. Sensitivity analysis showed 
that cost-effectiveness was predominately driven by the cost of CHB treatment 
and influenced by disease progression rates. Hence for Australia to reach the 
National Hepatitis B Strategy 2022 targets and WHO Strategy 2030 targets, it 
requires an improvement in the CHB care cascade. We estimated it is 
cost-effective to spend up to A$328 million or A$538 million per year to reach 
the National and WHO Strategy targets, respectively.

Aims: The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, as 
well as a budget impact analysis, on the use of apremilast for the treatment of 
adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (defined as a psoriasis 
area severity index [PASI] ≥ 10), who failed to respond to, had a 
contraindication to, or were intolerant to other systemic therapies, within the 
Italian National Health Service (NHS).Materials and methods: A Markov 
state-transition cohort model adapted to the Italian context was used to compare 
the costs of the currently available treatments and of the patients' quality of 
life with two alternative treatment sequences, with or without apremilast as 
pre-biologic therapy. Moreover, a budget impact model was developed based on the 
population of patients treated for psoriasis in Italy, who would be eligible for 
treatment with apremilast.Results: Over 5 years, the cost-effectiveness analysis 
showed that the strategy of using apremilast before biologic therapy was 
dominant compared with the sequence of biologic treatments without apremilast. 
In addition, it is important to underline that the use of apremilast slightly 
increases the quality-adjusted life years gained over 5 years. Furthermore, 
within the budget impact analysis, the strategy including apremilast would lead 
to a saving of €16 million within 3 years. Savings would mainly be related to a 
reduction in pharmaceutical spending, hospital admissions and other drug 
administration-related costs.Conclusion: These models proved to be robust to 
variation in parameters and it suggested that the use of apremilast would lead 
to savings to the Italian healthcare system with potential benefits in terms of 
patients' quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Older people with hypertension and multiple chronic conditions (MCC) 
receive complex treatments and face challenging trade-offs. Patients' 
preferences for different health outcomes can impact multiple treatment 
decisions. Since evidence about outcome preferences is especially scarce among 
people with MCC our aim was to elicit preferences of people with MCC for 
outcomes related to hypertension, and to determine how these outcomes should be 
weighed when benefits and harms are assessed for patient-centered clinical 
practice guidelines and health economic assessments.
METHODS: We sent a best-worst scaling preference survey to a random sample 
identified from a primary care network of Kaiser Permanente (Colorado, USA). The 
sample included individuals age 60 or greater with hypertension and at least two 
other chronic conditions. We assessed average ranking of patient-important 
outcomes using conditional logit regression (stroke, heart attack, heart 
failure, dialysis, cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney 
injury, fainting, injurious falls, low blood pressure with dizziness, treatment 
burden) and studied variation across individuals.
RESULTS: Of 450 invited participants, 217 (48%) completed the survey, and we 
excluded 10 respondents who had more than two missing choices, resulting in a 
final sample of 207 respondents. Participants ranked stroke as the most 
worrisome outcome and treatment burden as the least worrisome outcome 
(conditional logit parameters: 3.19 (standard error 0.09) for stroke, 0 for 
treatment burden). None of the outcomes were always chosen as the most or least 
worrisome by more than 25% of respondents, indicating that all outcomes were 
somewhat worrisome to respondents. Predefined subgroup analyses according to 
age, self-reported life-expectancy, degree of comorbidity, number of medications 
and antihypertensive treatment did not reveal meaningful differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Although some outcomes were more worrisome to patients than others, 
our results indicate that none of the outcomes should be disregarded for 
clinical practice guidelines and health economic assessments.

OBJECTIVE: Investigate the differences in spine surgery cost for metabolic 
syndrome patients.
METHODS: Included were patients ≥18 undergoing fusion. Patients were divided 
into cervical, thoracic, and lumbar groups based on their upper instrumented 
vertebrae (UIV). Metabolic syndrome patients (MetS) included those with body 
mass index >30, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Propensity 
score matching for invasiveness between non-MetS and MetS used to assess cost 
differences. Total surgery costs for MetS and non-MetS adult spinal deformity 
patients were compared. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost per QALY 
for UIV groups were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 312 invasiveness matched surgeries met inclusion criteria. 
Baseline demographics and surgical details included age 57.7 ± 14.5, 54% female, 
body mass index 31.1 ± 6.6, 17% anterior approach, 70% posterior approach, 13% 
combined approach, and 3.8 ± 4.1 levels fused. The average costs of surgery 
between MetS and non-Mets patients was $60,579.30 versus $52,053.23 (P < 0.05). 
When costs were compared between UIV groups, MetS patients had higher cervical 
and thoracic surgery costs ($23,203.43 vs. $19,153.43, $75,230.05 vs. 
$65,746.16, all P < 0.05) and lower lumbar costs ($31,775.64 vs. $42,643.37, P < 
0.05). However, the average cost per QALY at 1 year was $639,069.32 for MetS 
patients and $425,840.30 for non-Mets patients (P < 0.05). At life expectancy, 
the cost per QALY was $45,456.83 versus $26,026.84 (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: When matched by invasiveness, MetS patients had an average 16.4% 
higher surgery costs, 50% higher costs per QALY at 1 year, and 75% higher cost 
per QALY at life expectancy. Further research is needed on the possible utility 
of reducing comorbidities in preoperative patients.

BACKGROUND: Past research has shown how fires, heat and hot substances are 
important causes of health loss globally. Detailed estimates of the morbidity 
and mortality from these injuries could help drive preventative measures and 
improved access to care.
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Disease 2017 framework to produce three 
main results. First, we produced results on incidence, prevalence, years lived 
with disability, deaths, years of life lost and disability-adjusted life years 
from 1990 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. Second, we analysed these 
results to measure mortality-to-incidence ratios by location. Third, we reported 
the measures above in terms of the cause of fire, heat and hot substances and 
the types of bodily injuries that result.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 8 991 468 (7 481 218 to 10 740 897) new fire, heat 
and hot substance injuries in 2017 with 120 632 (101 630 to 129 383) deaths. At 
the global level, the age-standardised mortality caused by fire, heat and hot 
substances significantly declined from 1990 to 2017, but regionally there was 
variability in age-standardised incidence with some regions experiencing an 
increase (eg, Southern Latin America) and others experiencing a significant 
decrease (eg, High-income North America).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality of injuries that result from fire, heat 
and hot substances affect every region of the world but are most concentrated in 
middle and lower income areas. More resources should be invested in measuring 
these injuries as well as in improving infrastructure, advancing safety measures 
and ensuring access to care.

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is one of the most aggressive cancer types with a 
patient's life expectancy of typically less than one year upon diagnosis. The 
urgency of finding novel therapeutic approaches to treat mesothelioma is 
evident. Here we tested the effect of the plant-growth regulator forchlorfenuron 
(FCF), an inhibitor of septin function(s) in mammalian cells, on the viability 
and proliferation of MM cell lines, as well as other tumor cell lines derived 
from lung, prostate, colon, ovary, cervix and breast. Exposure to FCF strongly 
inhibited proliferation of human and mouse (most efficiently epithelioid) MM 
cells and all other tumor cells in a concentration-dependent manner and led to 
cell cycle arrest and cell death. The role of septin 7 (SEPT7), a presumably 
essential target of FCF in MM cells was confirmed by an shRNA strategy. FCF was 
robustly inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro at low micromolar (IC50: 
≈20-60µM) concentrations and more promisingly also in vivo. Initial experiments 
with FCF analogous revealed the importance of FCF's chloride group for efficient 
cell growth inhibition. FCF's rather low systemic toxicity might warrant for an 
extended search for other related and possibly more potent FCF analogues to 
target MM and putatively other septin-dependent tumors.

Singapore is one of the fastest-aging populations due to increased life 
expectancy and lowered fertility. Lifestyle changes increase the burden of 
chronic diseases and disability. These have important implications for social 
protection systems. The goal of this paper is to model future functional 
disability and healthcare expenditures based on current trends. To project the 
health, disability and hospitalization spending of future elders, we adapted the 
Future Elderly Model (FEM) to Singapore. The FEM is a dynamic Markov 
microsimulation model developed in the US. Our main source of population data 
was the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) consisting of 63,000 respondents 
followed up over three waves from 1993 to 2010. The FEM model enables us to 
investigate the effects of disability compounded over the lifecycle and 
hospitalization spending, while adjusting for competing risk of 
multi-comorbidities. Results indicate that by 2050, 1 in 6 elders in Singapore 
will have at least one ADL disability and 1 in 3 elders will have at least one 
IADL disability, an increase from 1 in 12 elders and 1 in 5 elders respectively 
in 2014. The highest prevalence of functional disability will be in those aged 
85 years and above. Lifetime hospitalization spending of elders aged 55 and 
above is US$24,400 (30.2%) higher among people with functional disability 
compared to those without disability. Policies that successfully tackle diabetes 
and promote healthy living may reduce or delay the onset of disability, leading 
to potential saving. In addition, further technological improvements may reduce 
the financial burden of disability.

Precursor-Independent Overproduction of Beta-Amyloid in AD: Mitochondrial 
Dysfunction as Possible Initiator of Asymmetric RNA-Dependent βAPP mRNA 
Amplification. An Engine that Drives Alzheimer's Disease.

Medical School, USA.

The present study defines RNA-dependent amplification of βAPP mRNA as a 
molecular basis of beta-amyloid overproduction in Alzheimer's disease. In this 
process, βAPP mRNA serves as a template for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp 
complex. The resulting antisense RNA self-primes its extension utilizing two 
complementary elements: 3'-terminal and internal, located within an antisense 
segment corresponding to the coding portion of βAPP mRNA. The extension produces 
3'-terminal fragment of βAPP mRNA, a part of a hairpin-structured 
antisense/sense RNA molecule. Cleavage at the 3' end of the hairpin loop 
produces RNA end product encoding a C-terminal fragment of βAPP. Since each 
conventional βAPP mRNA can be used repeatedly as a template, the process 
constitutes an asymmetric mRNA amplification. The 5'-most translation initiation 
codon of the amplified mRNA is the AUG preceding immediately and in-frame the 
Aβ-coding segment. Translation from this codon overproduces Aβ independently of 
βAPP. Such process can occur in humans but not in mice and other animals where 
segments of βAPP antisense RNA required for self-priming have little, if any, 
complementarity. This explains why Alzheimer's disease occurs exclusively in 
humans and implies that βAPP mRNA amplification is requisite in AD. In AD, 
therefore, there are two pathways of beta-amyloid production: βAPP proteolytic 
pathway and βAPP mRNA amplification pathway independent of βAPP and insensitive 
to beta-secretase inhibition. This implies that in healthy humans, where only 
the proteolytic pathway is in operation, Aβ production should be suppressed by 
the BACE inhibition, and indeed it is. However, since βAPP-independent pathway 
operating in AD is by far the predominant one, BACE inhibition has no effect in 
Alzheimer's disease. It appears that, physiologically, the extent of 
beta-amyloid overproduction sufficient to trigger amyloid cascade culminating in 
AD requires asymmetric RNA-dependent amplification of βAPP mRNA and cannot be 
reached without it. In turn, the occurrence of mRNA amplification process 
depends on the activation of inducible components of RdRp complex by certain 
stresses, for example the ER stress in case of amplification of mRNA encoding 
extracellular matrix proteins. In case of Alzheimer's disease, such an induction 
appears to be triggered by stresses associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, a 
phenomenon closely linked to AD. The cause-and-effect relationships between 
mitochondrial dysfunction and AD appear to be very different in familial, FAD, 
and sporadic, SAD cases. In FAD, increased levels or more toxic species of Aβ 
resulting from the abnormal proteolysis of βAPP trigger mitochondrial 
dysfunction, activate mRNA amplification and increase the production of Aβ, 
reinforcing the cycle. Thus in FAD, mitochondrial dysfunction is an intrinsic 
component of the amyloid cascade. The reverse sequence is true in SAD where 
aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction activates amplification of βAPP mRNA and 
enhances the production of Aβ. This causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, 
the cycle repeats and degeneration increases. Thus in SAD, the initial 
mitochondrial dysfunction arises prior to the disease, independently of and 
upstream from the increased Aβ production, i.e. in SAD, mitochondrial pathology 
hierarchically supersedes Aβ pathology. This is the primary reason for the 
formulation of the Mitochondrial Cascade Hypothesis. But even in terms of the 
MCH, the core of the disease is the amyloid cascade as defined in the amyloid 
cascade hypothesis, ACH. The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to 
this core is causative in SAD and auxiliary in FAD. In FAD, the initial increase 
in the production of Aβ is mutations-based and occurs relatively early in life, 
whereas in SAD it is coerced by an aging-contingent component, but both lead to 
mechanistically identical self-perpetuating mutual Aβ/mitochondrial dysfunction 
feedback cycles, an engine that drives, via RNA-dependent βAPP mRNA 
amplification, overproduction of beta-amyloid and, consequently, AD; hence 
drastic difference in the age of onset, yet profound pathological and 
symptomatic similarity in the progression, of familial and sporadic forms of 
Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, the recent findings that mitochondrial 
microprotein PIGBOS interacts with the ER in mitigating the unfolded protein 
response indicate a possible connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and ER 
stress, implicated in activation of RNA-dependent mRNA amplification pathway. 
The possible involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in βAPP mRNA amplification 
makes it a promising therapeutic target. Recent successes in mitigating, and 
even reversing, Aβ-induced metabolic defects with anti-diabetes drug metformin 
are encouraging in this respect.

A Rare Case of Triple Positive Metachronous Breast Cancer.

Chhatrala HS(1), Khuu J(1), Zuberi L(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Florida Health at Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, USA.

Metachronous contralateral breast cancer (MCBC) is defined as contralateral 
breast cancer (BC) diagnosed more than 1 year after previous BC diagnosis. More 
BC survivors are at risk of MCBC given improved life expectancy with the 
availability of advanced cancer care. Estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor 
negative and HER-2-positive status of first BC are independent risk factors for 
the development of MCBC. We present a rare case of triple positive (estrogen 
receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 positive) MCBC patient who eventually 
developed brain metastasis within 15 months despite a near complete pathologic 
response of primary tumor. This case highlights that even in this era of 
antiestrogen and anti-HER-2 therapies, triple positive MCBC can have an 
aggressive clinical course, especially with brain metastasis as the first sign 
of metastasis.

The present review was conducted to describe current published risk scoring 
systems to predict late mortality after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The aim of 
the study is to identify simple, clinical, and reproducible tools to predict 
life expectancy in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis candidates 
to CEA and therefore which patients may benefit from surgery, reaching the goal 
of life expectancy >3 to 5 years, recommended by guidelines. Advantages, 
disadvantages, feasibility, simplicity, and reproducibility of each selected 
score were analyzed. Rigorous statistical analysis and validation of the score 
are essential components to produce a calibrated and usable score. Future 
studies should address the impact of using these tools in CEA candidates for 
asymptomatic disease.

OBJECTIVES: Describe the clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of 
patients with HIV-1 who have commercial or Medicare health insurance in the 
United States.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Administrative claims for adult commercial and Medicare health plan 
enrollees with evidence of HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 
January 1, 2007, and March 31, 2017, were assessed. Current and previous 
complete ART regimens were identified using a claims-based algorithm. Results 
were stratified by treatment status and insurance type.
RESULTS: Of 18,699 eligible patients, 5027 (27%) had no previous ART regimens; 
15,275 (82%) had commercial insurance. Mean age was 47.5 years. Common 
comorbidities included hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, 
depression, and anxiety. The mean number of ART regimens was 1.43, with 31% of 
patients having 2 or more regimens. Mean (SD) daily pill burden was higher in 
patients with more than 1 ART regimen over time (5.7 [6.0] pills) or with 
Medicare insurance (9.2 [8.0] pills) than in patients with no previous ART (1.9 
[4.4] pills) or with commercial insurance (3.7 [4.7] pills). Overall, 60% of 
patients achieved 90% or greater adherence to their ART regimen and 16% had a 
prescription filled for any contraindicated medication to an ART during their 
regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: This descriptive study demonstrated that people living with HIV 
enrolled in Medicare have a significant amount of comorbidities and total pill 
burden. Although advancements in ART have significantly improved life expectancy
