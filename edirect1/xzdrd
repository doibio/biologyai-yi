query terms "hypopharyngeal carcinoma" and "reconstruction" to identify the most 
relevant articles without restricting publication dates. Information about the 
types of defects and methods of reconstruction was extracted from the reviewed 
articles. Two books were also reviewed, which were Regional and Free Flaps for 
Head and Neck Reconstruction (second edition) and Head and Neck Reconstruction: 
A Defect-Oriented Approach. Conclusion. Deciding the appropriate approach to a 
case should be individualized and should depend on the capabilities of the 
center, the defect's size and status, and lastly, the surgeon's training. The 
use of interpretation in the diagnosis of flaps can offer the best results in 
restoring functionality and vascularity and might also offer improved cosmesis.

INTRODUCTION: despite improved life expectancy for people living with HIV 
(PLWH), aging, comorbidities, and associated drug treatment increase the risk 
for drug therapy problems (DTPs). We assessed pharmacists´ identification and 
resolution of DTPs among PLWH.
METHODS: a prospective study was conducted among PLWH aged ≥10 years (N=100) in 
a Nigerian HIV clinic. Trained pharmacists delivered a six-step intervention 
that included the establishment of patient-provider relationship, gathering and 
validation of patient´s data, identification of DTPs, intervention, outcome 
identification, and documentation. Descriptive statistics were used to examine 
data collected via a pharmaceutical care assessment tool.
RESULTS: in all, 215 DTPs were identified and classified as unnecessary drug 
therapy [27.4% (n=59)], non-adherence [21.9% (n=47)], needs additional drug 
therapy [16.7% (n=36)], adverse drug reaction [(14.0% (n=30)], wrong drug 
[(10.7% (n=23)], and dosage variation [n=20 (9.3%)]. Within each DTP class, the 
most common cause was addiction/recreational drug use [39.0% (n=23)], drug 
product not available [63.8% (n=30)], untreated condition(s) [61.1% (n=22)], 
undesirable effects [66.7% (n=20)], condition refractory to drug [34.8% (n=8)], 
and drug interaction [45.0% (n=9)], respectively. The most common interventions 
were medication information/recommendation to patients/prescribers (30.4%) and 
initiation of drug therapy (22.2%). Six-month resolution rate was 90% (n=194) 
with the most common outcomes being improvement in patient adherence [23.6% 
(n=50)], addition of a drug [18.9% (n=40)], and reduction in drug overuse [15.6% 
(n=33)].
CONCLUSION: pharmacists´ intervention resulted in 90% resolution of detected 
DTPs, implying that pharmacists are crucial in improving antiretroviral 
treatment outcomes.

Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is one of the most difficult cancers in the head and 
neck region due to the complex geometry of the tumour and the surrounding 
critical organs. High-dose radical radiotherapy with or without concurrent 
platinum-based chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality. Around 10%-15% of 
NPC patients have their diagnosis at age after 70. The management of NPC in 
elderly patients is particularly challenging as they encompass a broad range of 
patient phenotypes and are often prone to treatment-related toxicities. 
Chronologic age alone is insufficient to decide on the management plan. 
Comprehensive geriatric assessment with evaluation on patients' functional 
status, mental condition, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, risks and 
benefits of the treatment, patients' preference, and family support is 
essential. In addition, little data from randomized controlled trials are 
available to guide treatment decisions in elderly patients with NPC. In deciding 
which treatment strategy would be suitable for an individual elderly patient, we 
reviewed the literature and reviewed the analysis of primary studies, reviews, 
and guidelines on management of NPC. This review also summarises the current 
evidence for NPC management in elderly adults from early to late stage of 
disease.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) may offer a normal life expectancy to Chronic 
Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients. However, a higher than expected incidence of 
arterial occlusive events (AOEs) was observed during treatment with nilotinib. 
We previously showed an "inflammatory status" during nilotinib that may explain 
the increased incidence of AOEs. Thus, we conducted this prospective KIARO study 
involving 186 CML patients (89 imatinib, 59 nilotinib, 38 dasatinib). 
Interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 10 (IL10), Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα), 
oxLDL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) plasma levels were 
measured at diagnosis and during treatment, with the aim to investigate changes 
in the inflammatory status favoring AOEs of each patient. Clinical and 
biochemical pro-atherothrombotic profiles and the 10-year SCORE chart were also 
evaluated. We showed a pro-inflammatory/pro-oxidative milieu increasing along 
treatment with nilotinib compared with imatinib or dasatinib, as demonstrated by 
higher hs-CRP and oxLDL levels and increased IL6/IL10 and TNFα/IL10 ratios only 
in nilotinib cohort. After median follow-up of 23.3 months starting from TKI, 
10/186 patients (5.4%) suffered an AOE. Approximately 5/10 (50%) AOEs occurred 
during nilotinib treatment despite a lower 10-year SCORE and a lower median age 
in this subgroup. A longer follow-up is needed to further confirm the active 
role of nilotinib in AOEs pathogenesis.

Carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality have become hot issues of political 
and economic activities in China and abroad. The structure and development of 
various industries in China will be profoundly affected in the process of 
accomplishing &quot;Dual Carbon&quot; goals. Eco-agriculture of Chinese 
medicine(EACM) highlights the balance and sustainable development of the 
ecosystem while producing high-quality medicinal materials. With chemically 
synthesized fertilizers, pesticides, and growth regulators prohibited, EACM 
emphasizes the recycling of agricultural and sideline products and the reduction 
of waste output, which results in the minimal negative impact on the ecological 
environment. Therefore, it is typical agriculture with low-carbon sources and 
high-carbon sinks. This study reviewed the mechanism and potential of EACM in 
carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality, analyzed the specific ways of EACM 
in reducing carbon sources and increasing carbon sinks based on the typical 
ecological planting pattern, and proposed the point of view to strengthen EACM 
as well as the &quot;Dual Carbon&quot; theory and research methods, so as to 
direct low-carbon and efficient deve-lopment. Furthermore, this study advocated 
to comprehensively promote the transformation of Chinese medicine production 
from chemical agriculture to eco-agriculture to improve the comprehensive 
benefits of contribution rate of carbon neutrality, explore and establish carbon 
sink compensation mechanism to ensure the sustainable and healthy development of 
EACM, and strengthen the training of EACM and &quot;Dual Carbon&quot; theory and 
technologies to continuously improve the capacity of EACM in sustainable 
development. This study is expected to provide a reference for the development 
of ecological functions in EACM and the development of economic functions 
through ecological functions.

IMPORTANCE: A poor prognostic understanding regarding curability is associated 
with lower odds of hospice use among patients with cancer. However, the 
association between poor prognostic understanding or prognostic discordance and 
health care use among older adults with advanced incurable cancers is not well 
characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of poor prognostic understanding and 
patient-oncologist prognostic discordance with hospitalization and hospice use 
among older adults with advanced cancers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a post hoc secondary analysis of a 
cluster randomized clinical trial that recruited patients from October 29, 2014, 
to April 28, 2017. Data were collected from community oncology practices 
affiliated with the University of Rochester Cancer Center National Cancer 
Institute Community Oncology Research Program. The parent trial enrolled 541 
patients who were aged 70 years or older and were receiving or considering any 
line of cancer treatment for incurable solid tumors or lymphomas; the patients' 
oncologists and caregivers (if available) were also enrolled. Patients were 
followed up for at least 1 year. Data were analyzed from January 3 to 16, 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At enrollment, patients and oncologists were asked 
about their beliefs regarding cancer curability (100%, >50%, 50%, <50%, and 0%; 
answers other than 0% reflected poor prognostic understanding) and life 
expectancy (≤6 months, 7-12 months, 1-2 years, 2-5 years, and >5 years; answers 
of >5 years reflected poor prognostic understanding). Any difference between 
oncologist and patient in response options was considered discordant. Outcomes 
were any hospitalization and hospice use at 6 months captured by the clinical 
research associates.
RESULTS: Among the 541 patients, the mean (SD) age was 76.6 (5.2) years, 264 of 
540 (49%) were female, and 486 of 540 (90%) were White. Poor prognostic 
understanding regarding curability was reported for 59% (206 of 348) of 
patients, and poor prognostic understanding regarding life expectancy estimates 
was reported for 41% (205 of 496) of patients. Approximately 60% (202 of 336) of 
patient-oncologist dyads were discordant regarding curability, and 72% (356 of 
492) of patient-oncologist dyads were discordant regarding life expectancy 
estimates. Poor prognostic understanding regarding life expectancy estimates was 
associated with lower odds of hospice use (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 
0.16-0.59). Discordance regarding life expectancy estimates was associated with 
greater odds of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01-2.66).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study highlights different constructs of 
prognostic understanding and the need to better understand the association 
between prognostic understanding and health care use among older adult patients 
with advanced cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Both life expectancy and the proportion of the population in elderly 
are increasing. Therefore, the number of cases of acute appendicitis (AA) among 
the super-elderly population is increasing. In this study, it is aimed to find 
the correlations between morbidity and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), albumin and prognostic nutritional index 
(PNI) in super-elderly patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we studied super-elderly 
patients (85 years old and above) who were operated on due to AA between January 
2015 and January 2020 at a tertiary health center. After approval by the ethics 
committee, patients' preoperative, peroperative and postoperative data were 
collected. Patients were divided into two groups: the morbidity-positive (+) 
group and the morbidity-negative (-) group. The differences between the two 
groups regarding the parameters investigated were evaluated.
RESULTS: 25 super-elderly patients were operated on for AA. There were 7 
patients in the morbidity (+) group and 18 in the morbidity (-) group. The area 
under the curve (AUC) for NLR was 0.476 ([95% CI: 0.215-0.738]; p = 0.856), and 
the AUC for PLR was 0.444 ([95% CI: 0.193-0.696]; p = 0.672). However, the AUC 
for PNI was 0.810 ([95% CI: 0.569-1.000]; p = 0.018), and the AUC for albumin 
was 0.845 ([95% CI: 0.601-1.000]; p = 0.008). At the cut-off value of 3.35 g/dL, 
albumin's sensitivity was 88.9% and its specificity was 85.7%. At the cut-off 
value of 38, PNI's sensitivity was 94.4% and its specificity was 71.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that PNI and albumin values can be used as 
prognostic factors and have high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this 
study is a leader study in identifying prognostic factors for AA that can be 
used in the super-elderly geriatric population. However, the possibility of 
statistical error should be minimized by conducting studies involving more 
patients.

Advanced Liver Disease (AdvLD) is common, morbid, and associated with high 
likelihood of death. Patients may not fully understand their prognosis and are 
often unprepared for the course of illness. Little is known about how and when 
to deliver prognosis-related information to patients with AdvLD, who should 
participate, and what should be discussed. We conducted in-depth interviews with 
a multi-profession sample of Hepatology clinicians and patients with AdvLD. 
Participants were drawn from three geographically diverse facilities (New 
England, Texas, California). We used inductive and deductive qualitative data 
analysis approaches to identify themes related to AdvLD prognosis discussions. 
Thematic analysis focused on content, timing, and participants' roles in 
prognosis discussions. In total, 31 patients with AdvLD and 26 multi-profession 
clinicians completed interviews. Most participants provided a broad 
conceptualization of prognosis beyond predictions of survival, including 
expectations about illness course, ways to manage or avoid complications and a 
need to address patients' emotions. Patients favored initiating discussions 
early in the AdvLD course and welcomed a multi-profession approach to conducting 
discussions. Clinicians favored a larger role for specialty physicians. All 
participants recognized that AdvLD prognosis discussions occur infrequently and 
favored a structured, standardized approach to broadly discussing prognosis. 
Patients with AdvLD and their clinicians favored a multifaceted approach to 
prognosis conversations including discussions of life expectancy, predictions 
about likely course of liver disease, and expected changes in function and 
capabilities over time. Structured and early prognosis discussions should be 
part of routine AdvLD care.

Increasing human longevity is of global interest. The present study explored the 
prediction of longevity from both individual perspective and family perspective 
based on demographic and psychosocial factors. A total of 186 longevous family 
members and 237 ordinary elderly family members participated in a 
cross-sectional study, and a sample of 62 longevous elderly and 57 ordinary 
elderly were selected for comparative research. The results showed that it was 
three times more female than male in longevous elderly group. Up to 71.2% of 
longevous elderly had no experience in education, which was significantly lower 
than that of ordinary elderly. Due to such extreme age, more widowed (81.4%) 
elderly than those in married (18.6%). Less than one-seventh of the longevous 
elderly maintained the habit of smoking, and about one-third of them liked 
drinking, both were significantly lower than that of ordinary elderly. In terms 
of psychosocial factors, longevous elderly showed lower neuroticism and social 
support, while higher extraversion, compared with the ordinary elderly. However, 
there were no significant differences between the two family groups in 
demographic and psychosocial variables, except longevous families showing lower 
scores in neuroticism. Regression analysis found that neuroticism, social 
support and smoking habit had significant impact on individuals' life span, 
then, neuroticism and psychoticism were the key factor to predict families' 
longevity. We conclude that good emotional management, benign interpersonal 
support, and moderation of habits are important factors for individual 
longevity, and the intergenerational influence of personality is closely related 
to family longevity.

OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy has an essential role in the management of skull base 
chondrosarcomas (SBCs) after resection. This multi-institutional study evaluated 
the outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for histopathologically proven 
SBCs.
METHODS: Data of patients who underwent GKRS for SBCs at Gamma Knife centers in 
Japan were retrospectively collected. Patients without a histopathological 
diagnosis and those who had intracranial metastases from extracranial 
chondrosarcomas were excluded. Histologically, grade III and some 
nonconventional variants were identified as aggressive types. The cumulative 
local control rates (LCRs) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors potentially affecting the LCR 
were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model for bivariate and 
multivariate analyses. The incidence of radiation-induced adverse effects (RAEs) 
was calculated as crude rates, and factors associated with RAEs were examined 
using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled, with a median age of 38 years. Thirty 
patients (59%) were treated with upfront GKRS for residual SBCs after resection 
(n = 27) or biopsy (n = 3), and 21 (41%) underwent GKRS as a salvage treatment 
for recurrence. The median tumor volume was 8 cm3. The overall LCRs were 87% at 
3 years, 78% at 5 years, and 67% at 10 years after GKRS. A better LCR was 
associated with a higher prescription dose (p = 0.039) and no history of 
repeated recurrence before GKRS (p = 0.024). The LCRs among patients with the 
nonaggressive histological type and treatment with ≥ 16 Gy were 88% at 3 years, 
83% at 5 years, and 83% at 10 years. The overall survival rates after GKRS were 
96% at 5 years and 83% at 10 years. Although RAEs were observed in 3 patients 
(6%), no severe RAEs with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 
or higher were identified. No significant factor was associated with RAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: GKRS for SBCs has a favorably low risk of RAEs and could be a 
reasonable therapeutic option for SBC in multimodality management. A sufﬁcient 
GKRS prescription dose is necessary for higher LCRs. Histological grading and 
subtype evaluations are important for excluding exceptional SBCs. Patients with 
conventional SBCs have a long life expectancy and should be observed for life 
after treatment.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women 
associated with cardiovascular disease and obesity. The possible benefits of 
omega-3 supplementation in this syndrome have been discussed much. This study is 
aimed to verify, based on the scientific data published, if there are any 
benefits in the omega-3 supplementation in the treatment of PCOS and to indicate 
its possible dosages for the treatment of polycystic ovary. The work consists of 
a systematic review of clinical trials and cohort of the MEDLINE/PubMed database 
from 2009 to October 2019. All studies that analyzed the omega-3 supplementation 
in women with PCOS were included. Cross-sectional studies, review articles, 
systematic reviews, meta-analysis, duplicates, studies in animals or cell 
culture, studies with omega-3 supplementation via food or associated with other 
supplementations were not included, except those involving vitamin E. In total, 
21 articles were selected. Despite the heterogeneity of the studies selected, 
indirect benefits were observed mainly regarding the glycemic profile, such as 
insulin resistance reduction, lipid profile modulation (i.e. decrease in total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and elevation of high-density lipoprotein), and the 
regulation of the androgenic profile. As for the anthropometric profile, the 
studies were scarce and most of them had no significant meaning. Regarding the 
antioxidant profile and inflammatory biomarkers, the findings differ among 
studies, but promising results were observed with different doses over 12 weeks 
of use, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) reduction. Thus, omega-3 fatty acids 
promote indirect benefits in the treating of women with PCOS. However, to reveal 
well-defined standards for dosage and supplementation time, further studies are 
needed.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a treatable disease, and untreated depression can lead 
to serious health complications and decrease the quality of life. Therefore, 
prevention, early identification, and treatment efforts are essential. Screening 
has an essential role in preventive medicine in the general population. Ideally, 
screening tools detect patients early enough to manage the disease and reduce 
symptoms. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine screening 
schedules.
METHODS: We used a discrete-time nonstationary Markov model to simulate the 
progression of depression. We used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the 
stochastic model for 20 years or during the lifetime of individuals. Baseline 
and screening scenario models with screening frequencies of annual, 2-year, and 
5-year strategies were compared based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER). Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis were 
conducted to manage uncertainties.
RESULTS: In the general population, all screening strategies were cost-effective 
compared to the baseline. However, male and female populations differed based on 
cost over quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Females had lower ICERs, and 
annual screening had the highest ICER for females, with 11,134$/QALY gained. In 
contrast, males had around three times higher ICER, with annual screening costs 
of 34,065$/QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: We assumed that the screening frequency was not changing at any 
time during the screening scenario. In our calculations, false-positive cases 
were not taking into account.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high lifetime prevalence and recurrence rates of 
depression, detection and prevention efforts can be one critical cornerstone to 
support required care. Our analysis combined the expected benefits and costs of 
screening and assessed the effectiveness of screening scenarios. We conclude 
that routine screening is cost-effective for all age groups of females and 
young, middle-aged males.

There is limited information on functional low vision (FLV) in Latin America, 
especially in individuals under 50 years of age. In the present study, we 
retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 1393 consecutive subjects seen 
at a Brazilian tertiary rehabilitation service, from February 2009 to June 2016. 
We collected sociodemographic, clinical data, and information on optical aids 
and spectacle prescription. Subjects were divided into three age groups: 0 to 
14 years old (children), 15 to 49 years old (young adults), and 50 years or 
older (older adults). The main etiologies leading to FLV in children were 
cerebral visual impairment (27.9%), ocular toxoplasmosis (8.2%), and retinopathy 
of prematurity (7.8%). In young adults, retinitis pigmentosa (7.4%) and cone/rod 
dystrophy (6.5%) were the most frequent, while in older adults, age-related 
macular degeneration (25.3%) and diabetic retinopathy (18.0%) were the leading 
causes. Our results indicate that preventable diseases are important causes of 
FLV in children in the area, and proper prenatal care could reduce their burden. 
The increasing life expectancy in Latin America and the diabetes epidemic are 
likely to increase the demand for affordable, people-centered rehabilitation 
centers, and their integration into health services should be planned 
accordingly.

The cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc- has been identified as the major 
source of extracellular glutamate in several brain regions as well as a 
modulator of neuroinflammation, and genetic deletion of its specific subunit xCT 
(xCT-/-) is protective in mouse models for age-related neurological disorders. 
However, the previously observed oxidative shift in the plasma cystine/cysteine 
ratio of adult xCT-/- mice led to the hypothesis that system xc- deletion would 
negatively affect life- and healthspan. Still, till now the role of system xc- 
in physiological aging remains unexplored. We therefore studied the effect of 
xCT deletion on the aging process of mice, with a particular focus on the immune 
system, hippocampal function, and cognitive aging. We observed that male xCT-/- 
mice have an extended lifespan, despite an even more increased plasma 
cystine/cysteine ratio in aged compared to adult mice. This oxidative shift does 
not negatively impact the general health status of the mice. On the contrary, 
the age-related priming of the innate immune system, that manifested as 
increased LPS-induced cytokine levels and hypothermia in xCT+/+ mice, was 
attenuated in xCT-/- mice. While this was associated with only a very moderate 
shift towards a more anti-inflammatory state of the aged hippocampus, we 
observed changes in the hippocampal metabolome that were associated with a 
preserved hippocampal function and the retention of hippocampus-dependent memory 
in male aged xCT-/- mice. Targeting system xc- is thus not only a promising 
strategy to prevent cognitive decline, but also to promote healthy aging.

PURPOSE: To test the effect of race/ethnicity on Social Security Administration 
(SSA) life tables' life expectancy (LE) predictions in localized prostate cancer 
(PCa) patients treated with either radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam 
radiotherapy (EBRT). We hypothesized that LE will be affected by race/ethnicity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We relied on the 2004-2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results database to identify D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk PCa 
patients treated with either RP or EBRT. SSA life tables were used to compute 
10-year LE predictions and were compared to OS. Stratification was performed 
according to treatment type (RP/EBRT) and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, 
non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian).
RESULTS: Of 55,383 assessable patients, 40,490 were non-Hispanic White (RP 49.3% 
vs. EBRT 50.7%), 7194 non-Hispanic Black (RP 41.3% vs. EBRT 50.7%), 4716 
Hispanic/Latino (RP 51.0% vs. EBRT 49.0%) and 2983 were Asian (RP 41.6% vs. EBRT 
58.4%). In both RP and EBRT patients, OS exceeded life tables' LE predictions, 
except for non-Hispanic Blacks. However, in RP patients, the magnitude of the 
difference was greater than in EBRT. Moreover, in RP patients, OS of 
non-Hispanic Blacks virtually perfectly followed predicted LE. Conversely, in 
EBRT patients, the OS of non-Hispanic Black patients was worse than predicted 
LE.
CONCLUSIONS: When comparing SEER-derived observed OS with SSA life table-derived 
predicted life expectancy, we recorded a survival disadvantage in non-Hispanic 
Black RP and EBRT patients, which was not the case in the three other 
races/ethnicities (non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic/Latinos, and Asians). This 
discrepancy should ideally be confirmed within different registries, countries, 
and tumor entities. Furthermore, the source of these discrepant survival 
outcomes should be investigated and addressed by health care politics.

The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been consistently modified for 
more than 60 years. L-DOPA, the blood-brain barrier permeable precursor prodrug 
of dopamine, is to date the only effective therapy on the market. However, it is 
well known that prolonged treatment with L-DOPA leads to several side effects, 
which may affect the patient's life expectancy (i.e., the wearing-off 
phenomenon, on-off fluctuations, and dyskinesia). For this reason, 
modifications, and supplements to L-DOPA treatment have been and are being 
studied, which, however, have not yet resulted in a valid alternative to the 
cornerstone drug. This review aims to summarize the main formulations currently 
in use for PD treatment, explaining advantages and disadvantages for each class. 
The attention will be focused on the promising prodrug concept, aimed at finding 
a suitable L-DOPA substitute with improved pharmacokinetic behavior. In this 
respect, new potential candidates which show interesting properties for the 
intended scope, the so-called dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes(12) (carboranes), will 
be discussed. Carboranes are inorganic molecular icosahedral boron-carbon 
clusters with 12 vertices and 20 deltahedral faces. They have been extensively 
studied for applications in medicine as potential pharmacophores, reagents in 
boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and radiotherapy. Here, we discuss them as 
inorganic scaffolds for dopamine delivery at the central nervous system (CNS) 
level.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prostate cancer screening occurrence in patients with 
spinal cord injury at our institution compared to a matched, unaffected 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with the 
criteria: male, age 50-70, and diagnosis of cerebral palsy, spina bifida, or 
quadriplegia. A control cohort was matched by age, race, insurance, and 
co-morbidities. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening, PSA value, prostate 
MRI, prostate biopsy, and biopsy outcome were compared. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was performed to determine the association between patient 
variables and PSA screening.
RESULTS: The study cohort and control cohort included 2180 patients each. 
Patients with spinal cord injury had significantly lower rates of PSA screening 
(15% vs 24%, P <.00001), MRI (0.1% vs 0.6%, P = .02), and biopsy (0.6% vs 1.3%, 
P = .01) compared to control. Spinal cord injury was associated with a lower 
likelihood of PSA screening (OR = 0.56, CI = 0.48-0.65, P <.00001). There were 
no significant differences in PSA value and biopsy outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Patients with spinal cord injury had a lower likelihood of PSA 
screening compared to a matched control population. Since PSA screening is a 
shared-decision making process, providers should consider the increasing life 
expectancy of patients with spinal cord injury and risks of under-testing for 
prostate cancer.

Duplex specific nuclease (DSN) that can precisely cleave DNA portion in 
double-stranded DNA or DNA-RNA hybrid has engrossed immense attention owing to 
its great potential in emerging bioanalytical applications. Here, we present a 
novel approach to extend DSN sensing application by coupling RNA aptamer. 
Specially designed RNA ligand sequences are used to capture the target and 
simultaneously provide complementary sequences of DNA for DSN aided fluorescent 
signal enhancement. A clotting enzyme, thrombin, has been used as a model 
analyte. One RNA aptamer combined with the target molecule can generate 
fluorescent signals through cleavage of hybridized TaqMan DNA probe (P2) by DSN. 
The proposed assay has achieved the lowest detection limit of 0.039 pM. The 
assay has been applied for real-time detection of thrombin release from live 
cells and other biotic media for early disease diagnosis. The developed method 
is versatile and can detect various other targets by choosing the relevant 
aptamer and probe sequences. This method is promising to be applied to medical 
diagnosis, biosensing, food safety, environmental monitoring, and other fields.
