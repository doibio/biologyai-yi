The vast majority of germline and somatic variations occur in the noncoding part 
of the genome, only a small fraction of which are believed to be functional. 
From the tens of thousands of noncoding variations detectable in each genome, 
identifying and prioritizing driver candidates with putative functional 
significance is challenging. To address this, we implemented IW-Scoring, a new 
Integrative Weighted Scoring model to annotate and prioritise functionally 
relevant noncoding variations. We evaluate 11 scoring methods, and apply an 
unsupervised spectral approach for subsequent selective integration into two 
linear weighted functional scoring schemas for known and novel variations. 
IW-Scoring produces stable high-quality performance as the best predictors for 
three independent data sets. We demonstrate the robustness of IW-Scoring in 
identifying recurrent functional mutations in the TERT promoter, as well as 
disease SNPs in proximity to consensus motifs and with gene regulatory effects. 
Using follicular lymphoma as a paradigmatic cancer model, we apply IW-Scoring to 
locate 11 recurrently mutated noncoding regions in 14 follicular lymphoma 
genomes, and validate 9 of these regions in an extension cohort, including the 
promoter and enhancer regions of PAX5. Overall, IW-Scoring demonstrates greater 
versatility in identifying trait- and disease-associated noncoding variants.

The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: 
Pentatomidae), is an invasive pest that has been resident in California since 
2006. To better understand its seasonal phenology, we used baited traps to 
estimate nymph and adult population densities in midtown Sacramento, the focal 
area of the Northern California invasion. Adult H. halys populations were found 
soon after trapping began in February (2015-2016) or March (2014); the first egg 
masses for 2014, 2015, and 2016 were found on 5 May, 17 April, and 12 April, 
respectively, and the first nymphs were found 3 June, 19 May, and 9 May, 
respectively. There were two generations per year, with one peak in June and 
another in September. Summer temperatures above 36°C in July and August were 
associated with reduced catches in traps of both nymphs and adults. This extreme 
heat may have helped to form two clear nymph peaks and suppressed egg 
deposition. In 2016, two trap types and four lures were also compared. Trap type 
influenced season-long nymph captures, with fewer nymphs in double cone traps 
than pyramid traps. Lure type influenced season-long trap catch, with more 
nymphs and adults trapped with the Rescue lure than the AgBio Combo lure, Alpha 
Scents, or Trécé Pherocon Combo lures, although this difference was only 
associated with the capture of nymphs and we did not compare for longevity or 
seasonal variation. These data are discussed with respect to H. halys' phenology 
from the mid-Atlantic region.

Female pelvic organ prolapse is a widely prevalent condition and is associated 
with variable morbidity. It encompasses a number of clinical conditions, 
including subvesical obstruction, overactive bladder symptoms, sexual 
dysfunction and urinary und fecal incontinence. The prevalence of pelvic 
insufficiency is estimated to be between 30 and 50 %. As life expectancy is 
increasing and the elderly population is growing, there will be an increased 
incidence of the condition and growing demand for pelvic floor treatment in the 
future. The incidence of recurrent pelvic floor prolapse is also growing. The 
goal of surgical management is the restoration of pelvic anatomy and bladder, 
vaginal and bowel function, resolution of patient symptoms and improvement in 
quality of life. The objective of this review is to present the main surgical 
procedures for different subtypes of genital prolapse and to evaluate their 
outcomes and complications. During the last ten years, technologies for the 
minimally invasive approach have advanced and robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy is 
now equivalent to classical vaginal and transabdominal procedures.

Publisher: Urogenitale Prolapserkrankungen sind mit hoher Prävalenz und 
unterschiedlicher Morbidität belastet. Klinisch imponieren Senkungs- und 
Miktionsbeschwerden mit Obstruktion, Drangsymptomatik und 
Begleitharninkontinenz. Die Prävalenz einer Beckenbodeninsuffizienz wird auf 
etwa 30 – 50 % geschätzt. Aufgrund der steigenden Lebenserwartungen und den 
damit verbundenen erhöhten Aktivitäten der Frauen ist sogar mit einem weiteren 
Anstieg der Senkungsinzidenz zu rechnen. Eine nicht geringe Zahl stellen dabei 
Rezidive dar. Schon heute zählen Operationen zur Therapie des Deszensus zu den 
häufigsten durchgeführten Operationen der Gynäkologie. In den USA werden 
jährlich über 220.000 Senkungsoperationen durchgeführt. Das Ziel der operativen 
Therapie ist die Behebung der jeweiligen Beschwerdesymptomatik mit konsekutiver 
Verbesserung der Lebensqualität. Ziel der Arbeit ist, die operativen Ergebnisse 
und Techniken unterschiedlicher Deszensuserkrankungen zu evaluieren und 
deskriptiv zu erfassen.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the utility and quality-of-life year 
measurements for patients with coronary artery disease who underwent any of 3 
therapeutic strategies with a 5-year follow-up.
METHODS: Quality-of-life data were obtained from the Medicine, Angioplasty, or 
Surgery Study II trial. To obtain utilities, the 36-Item Short-Form 
questionnaire was converted to a 6-Dimensional Health State Classification 
System.
RESULTS: Of the 611 initial patients, 579 completed the questionnaire. In all, 
188 patients received the surgical treatment-194 the percutaneous, and the 
remaining 197 the medical. The median utility scores for the 5 years analyzed 
were 0.809 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.794-0.842) for patients assigned to 
percutaneous coronary intervention, 0.755 (95% CI 0.723-0.774) for medical 
treatment, and 0.780 (95% CI 0.761-0.809) for coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery. The difference between percutaneous coronary intervention and medical 
treatment was statistically significant (P < .05, Dunn test). The median 
cumulative quality-of-life years across the 5 years were 3.802 (95% CI 
3.668-3.936) for percutaneous, 3.540 (95% CI 3.399-3.681) for medical, and 3.764 
(95% CI 3.638-3.890) for surgery. Additionally, the median quality-of-life years 
between percutaneous and medical treatment was 0.262 (95% CI 0.068-0.456), 
between surgery and medical treatment it was 0.224 (95% CI 0.036-0.413), and 
between surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention it was -0.038 (95% CI 
-0.221 to -0.146).
CONCLUSION: Coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary 
intervention were similar regarding cumulative quality-of-life years; however, 
they were both superior to that of medical treatment. The results presented are 
valuable data for further cost-utility studies.

Does Medical Expansion Improve Population Health?

Zheng H(1), George LK(2).

Author information:
(1)1 The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.
(2)2 Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.

Medical expansion has become a prominent dynamic in today's societies as the 
biomedical model becomes increasingly dominant in the explanation of health, 
illness, and other human problems and behavior. Medical expansion is 
multidimensional and represented by expansions in three major components of the 
healthcare system: increasing medical investment, medical 
professionalization/specialization, and the relative size of the pharmaceutical 
industry. Using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development health 
data and World Development Indicators 1981 to 2007, we find medical investment 
and medical professionalization/specialization significantly improve all three 
measures of life expectancy and decrease mortality rate even after controlling 
for endogeneity problems. In contrast, an expanded pharmaceutical industry is 
negatively associated with female life expectancy at age 65 and positively 
associated with the all-cause mortality rate. It further compromises the 
beneficial effect of medical professionalization/specialization on population 
health. In general, medical professionalization/specialization and gross 
domestic product per capita have similar and stronger effects than medical 
investment.

BACKGROUND: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a major barrier to sustainable 
human development, but its health burden and geographic distribution among 
provinces of China remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate IHD burden in 
provinces of China, and attributable to risk factors from 1990 to 2015.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study, which 
evaluated IHD burden and attributable risk factors using deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Statistical models including cause of 
death ensemble modelling, Bayesian meta-regression analysis, and comparative 
risk assessment approaches were applied to reduce bias and produce comprehensive 
results of IHD deaths, DALYs and attributable risks. The 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were calculated and reported for mortality and DALYs.
RESULTS: The age-standardised death rate per 100,000 people increased by 13.3% 
from 101.3 (95%UI: 95.3-107.5) to 114.8 (95%UI: 109.8-120.1) from 1990 to 2015 
in China, whereas the age-standardised DALY rate declined 3.9% to 1760.2 per 
100,000 people (95%UI: 1671.6-1864.3). In 2015, the age-standardised death rate 
per 100,000 people was the highest in Heilongjiang (187.4, 95%UI: 161.6-217.5) 
and the lowest in Shanghai (44.2, 95%UI: 37.0-53.1), and the age-standardised 
DALY rate per 100,000 people was the highest in Xinjiang (3040.8, 95%UI: 
2488.8-3735.4) and the lowest in Shanghai (524.4, 95%UI: 434.7-638.4). 
Geographically, the age-standardised death and DALY rates for southern provinces 
were lower than northern provinces, especially in southeastern coastal 
provinces. 95.3% of the IHD burden in China was attributable to environmental, 
behavioural and metabolic risk factors. The five leading IHD risks in 2015 were 
high systolic blood pressure, high total cholesterol, diet high in sodium, diet 
low in whole grains, and smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Population growth and ageing has led to a steady increase in the 
IHD burden. Regional disparities in IHD burden were observed in provinces of 
China. The distribution characteristics of IHD burden provide guidance for 
decision makers to formulate targeted preventive policies and interventions.

Increased life expectancy is associated with a high prevalence of chronic, 
non-communicable diseases including cognitive decline and dementia. The purpose 
of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive impairment using three 
cognitive abilities (verbal fluency, numeracy and perceived memory) and their 
association with cardiovascular risk factors in seniors across Europe. Data from 
participants in wave 4 of the SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in 
Europe) database was used. Cognitive performance in perceived memory, verbal 
fluency and numeracy was evaluated using simple tests and a memory complaints 
questionnaire. Clinical and sociodemographic variables were also studied for 
potential associations. Standardised prevalence rates of cognitive impairment 
based on age and gender were calculated by country. The prevalence of cognitive 
impairment was 28.02% for perceived memory, 27.89% for verbal fluency and 20.75% 
for numeracy throughout the 16 evaluated countries. Years of education, being a 
current or former smoker, number of chronic diseases, diabetes or hyperglycemia, 
heart attack and stroke were all independent variables associated with 
impairment in the three studied cognitive abilities. We also found independent 
associations between physical inactivity and verbal fluency and numeracy 
impairment, as well as hypertension and perceived memory impairment. Lower 
performance in the evaluated cognitive abilities and higher memory complaints 
are highly prevalent, have a heterogeneous distribution across Europe, and are 
associated with multiple factors, most of which are potentially preventable or 
treatable, especially cardiovascular risk factors.

Regeneration mechanism for skin and peripheral nerves clarified at the organ and 
molecular scales.

This article is a review of current research on the mechanism of regeneration of 
skin and peripheral nerves based on use of collagen scaffolds, particularly the 
dermis regeneration template (DRT), which is widely used clinically. DRT 
modifies the normal wound healing process, converting it from wound closure by 
contraction and scar formation to closure by regeneration. DRT achieves this 
modification by blocking wound contraction, which spontaneously leads to 
cancellation of scar formation, a process secondary to contraction. Contraction 
blocking by DRT is the result of a dramatic phenotype change in contractile 
cells (myofibroblasts, MFB) which follows specific binding of integrins α1β1 and 
α2β1 onto hexapeptide ligands, probably GFOGER and GLOGER, that are naturally 
present on the surface of collagen fibers in DRT. The methodology of organ 
regeneration based on use of DRT has been recently extended from traumatized 
skin to diseased skin. Successful extension of the method to other organs in 
which wounds heal by contraction is highly likely though not yet attempted. This 
regenerative paradigm is much more advanced both in basic mechanistic 
understanding and clinical use than methods based on tissue culture or stem 
cells. It is also largely free of risk and has shown decisively lower morbidity 
and lower cost than organ transplantation.

INTRODUCTION: The TEACHH score was developed to identify patients with predicted 
short (< 3 months) and long (> 1 year) life expectancy. We aimed to validate 
this model in an independent group of patients presenting for palliative spine 
radiotherapy and to compare it to alternate prognostic models.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed charts of 195 consecutive patients referred 
for palliative spine radiotherapy. Patients were grouped according to the number 
of risk factors from the TEACHH model, Chow model, and Oswestry Risk Index.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty patients with a median age of 65 years were 
included. Follow-up was 5.8 months in all patients and 31.8 months in living 
patients. For the TEACHH model, patients in groups 1, 2, and 3 had a median (95% 
CI) overall survival (OS) of 22.3 (15.7-36.1), 4.9 (3.8-6.6), and 1.5 (0.8-5.4) 
months, respectively. Wilcoxon pairwise comparisons showed statistically 
different survival between groups 1 and 2, and 1 and 3. In the Chow model, 
patients in groups 1, 2, and 3 had a median (95% CI) OS of 16.1 (10.0-22.3), 5.9 
(3.8-9.2), and 1.9 (1.2-2.5) months, respectively. There was a significant 
difference between all groups. The Oswestry Risk Index identified five 
prognostic groups with median OS (95% CI) ranging from 22.2 (12.9-30.2) to 2.1 
(0.8-4.0) months. Only group 1 was statistically different from the others. 
Although the effect of age was small, the TEACHH model performed best with the 
inclusion of all parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The TEACHH model is useful to identify patients with spinal 
metastases with predicted short, intermediate, and long LE. Its prognostic 
ability is similar to the Chow model.

PURPOSE: Little is known about the relationship between health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL), pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD), and modifiable lifestyle and 
physiological factors for ovarian cancer survivors (OCS). The primary aim of the 
study was to compare post-treatment advanced-stage OCS with age-matched controls 
on measures of HRQoL and PFD. The secondary aim was to examine associations 
between HRQoL, PFD, objective activity behaviors, physical function, and body 
composition in OCS.
METHODS: Twenty advanced-stage OCS and 20 controls completed questionnaires 
assessing HRQoL (SF-36) and PFD (Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire), and 
underwent objective assessments of activity behavior (7-day accelerometry), 
physical function (400-m walk, repeated chair rise, 6-m usual-pace walk, 
one-repetition maximum chest press, and single-leg extension), and body 
composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry).
RESULTS: Compared to controls, OCS had worse physical HRQoL (- 4.3 median 
difference, p = 0.013), but equivalent self-reported PFD, indicated by combined 
bladder, bowel, and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms (0.89 mean difference, 
p = 0.277). In OCS, physical HRQoL was significantly negatively associated with 
PFD (r = 0.468, p = 0.043). Decreased physical HRQoL and increased PFD were 
significantly associated with less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in 
≥ 10-min bouts (ρ = 0.627, p = 0.003; ρ = - 0.457, p = 0.049), more sedentary 
time (r = - 0.449, p = 0.047; r = 0.479, p = 0.038), and slower 400-m walk time 
(ρ = - 0.565, p = 0.022; ρ = 0.504, p = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-treatment advanced-stage OCS have decreased physical HRQoL, 
which is associated with modifiable factors such as worse PFD, less 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, more sedentary time, and decreased 
objective physical function. This highlights the need for ongoing supportive 
care and multidisciplinary interventions after first-line ovarian cancer 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Etelcalcetide is a novel intravenous calcimimetic for the 
treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in haemodialysis patients. The 
clinical efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (in addition to phosphate binders 
and vitamin D and/or analogues [PB/VD]) was evaluated in three phase III 
studies, including two placebo-controlled trials and a head-to-head study versus 
the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a decision-analytic model 
for economic evaluation of etelcalcetide compared with cinacalcet.
METHODS: We developed a life-time Markov model including potential treatment 
effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and subjects' 
persistence. Long-term efficacy of etelcalcetide was extrapolated from the 
reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the phase III trials and the available 
data from the outcomes study in cinacalcet (EVOLVE trial). Etelcalcetide was 
compared with cinacalcet, both in addition to PB/VD. We applied unit costs 
averaged from five European countries and a range of potential 
etelcalcetide pricing options assuming parity price to weekly use of cinacalcet 
and varying it by a 15 or 30% increase.
RESULTS: Compared with cinacalcet, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
etelcalcetide was €1,355 per QALY, €24,521 per QALY, and €47,687 per QALY for 
the three prices explored. The results were robust across the probabilistic and 
deterministic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our modelling approach enabled cost-utility assessment of the novel 
therapy for SHPT based on the observed and extrapolated data. This model can be 
used for local adaptations in the context of reimbursement assessment.

Population-based study examining the utilization of preventive medicines by 
older people in the last year of life.

AIM: To examine the patterns of preventive medicines (PM) use in the last year 
of life of older adults.
METHODS: This study cohort included individuals (n = 99 809) aged ≥75 years who 
were in their last year of life. PM examined in this study included low-dose 
aspirin (≤325 mg/day), clopidogrel, dipyridamole, warfarin, dabigatran, statins 
and bisphosphonates. Logistic regression models examined the influence of age, 
sex, multimorbidity, socioeconomic status, and a diagnosis of cancer on the 
number and type of PM prescribed from 2007 to 2012.
RESULTS: The number of PM prescribed was higher for men compared with women (OR 
1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.14). Increasing age did not have an effect on the number of 
PM prescribed. The use of clopidogrel increased almost threefold from 2007 to 
2012 (OR 5.53, 95% CI 4.61-6.65). In contrast, bisphosphonates use decreased 
significantly during the same period (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.32-0.39). Individuals 
with a diagnosis of cancer had increased odds of PM utilization for 
antiplatelets, aspirin monotherapy and statins, which had remarkably high odds 
(OR 4.11, 95% CI 3.88-4.34, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present explorative study highlighted that some PM, such as 
statins, continue to be prescribed until death, particularly those that might 
have been beneficial earlier in life, but have an uncertain or unfavorable 
risk-benefit ratio towards the end-of-life. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

Axitinib, cabozantinib, everolimus, nivolumab, sunitinib and best supportive 
care in previously treated renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review and 
economic evaluation.

Edwards SJ, Wakefield V, Cain P, Karner C, Kew K, Bacelar M, Masento N, Salih F.

BACKGROUND: Several therapies have recently been approved for use in the NHS for 
pretreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (amRCC), but there is a 
lack of comparative evidence to guide decisions between them.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
axitinib (Inlyta®, Pfizer Inc., NY, USA), cabozantinib (Cabometyx®, Ipsen, 
Slough, UK), everolimus (Afinitor®, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), nivolumab 
(Opdivo®, Bristol-Myers Squibb, NY, USA), sunitinib (Sutent®, Pfizer, Inc., NY, 
USA) and best supportive care (BSC) for people with amRCC who were previously 
treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review and mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) of 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Primary outcomes were overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were 
objective response rates (ORRs), adverse events (AEs) and health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL). MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library were searched from 
inception to January and June 2016 for RCTs and non-RCTs, respectively. Two 
reviewers abstracted data and performed critical appraisals.
REVIEW METHODS: A fixed-effects MTC was conducted for OS, PFS [hazard ratios 
(HRs)] and ORR (odds ratios), and all were presented with 95% credible intervals 
(CrIs). The RCT data formed the primary analyses, with non-RCTs and studies 
rated as being at a high risk of bias included in sensitivity analyses (SAs). 
HRQoL and AE data were summarised narratively. A partitioned survival model with 
health states for pre progression, post progression and death was developed to 
perform a cost-utility analysis. Survival curves were fitted to the PFS and OS 
results from the MTC. A systematic review of HRQoL was undertaken to identify 
sources of health state utility values.
RESULTS: Four RCTs (n = 2618) and eight non-RCTs (n = 1526) were included. The 
results show that cabozantinib has longer PFS than everolimus (HR 0.51, 95% CrI 
0.41 to 0.63) and both treatments are better than BSC. Both cabozantinib (HR 
0.66, 95% CrI 0.53 to 0.82) and nivolumab (HR 0.73, 95% CrI 0.60 to 0.89) have 
longer OS than everolimus. SAs were consistent with the primary analyses. The 
economic analysis, using drug list prices, shows that everolimus may be more 
cost-effective than BSC with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
£45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), as it is likely to be considered 
an end-of-life treatment. Cabozantinib has an ICER of £126,000 per QALY compared 
with everolimus and is unlikely to be cost-effective. Nivolumab was dominated by 
cabozantinib (i.e. more costly and less effective) and axitinib was dominated by 
everolimus.
LIMITATIONS: Treatment comparisons were limited by the small number of RCTs. 
However, the key limitation of the analysis is the absence of the drug prices 
paid by the NHS, which was a limitation that could not be avoided owing to the 
confidentiality of discounts given to the NHS.
CONCLUSIONS: The RCT evidence suggests that cabozantinib is likely to be the 
most effective for PFS and OS, closely followed by nivolumab. All treatments 
appear to delay disease progression and prolong survival compared with BSC, 
although the results are heterogeneous. The economic analysis shows that at list 
price everolimus could be recommended as the other drugs are much more expensive 
with insufficient incremental benefit. The applicability of these findings to 
the NHS is somewhat limited because existing confidential patient access schemes 
could not be used in the analysis. Future work using the discounted prices at 
which these drugs are provided to the NHS would better inform estimates of their 
relative cost-effectiveness.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer and 
current treatments exert small effects on life expectancy. The most common 
adjuvant treatment for PDAC is gemcitabine. However, relapse almost invariably 
occurs and most patients develop metastatic, incurable disease. The aim of the 
present study was to assess the activity of nanoparticle albumin-bound 
paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) alone or in combination with gemcitabine in PDAC 
cell lines displaying different degrees of sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment. 
We evaluated the effects of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel and their combination 
on cell proliferation, death, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in PDAC cell 
lines either sensitive to gemcitabine, or with primary or secondary resistance 
to gemcitabine. Our results indicated that the dose‑response of PDAC cell lines 
to nab-paclitaxel was similar, regardless of their sensitivity to gemcitabine. 
In addition, nab-paclitaxel elicited similar cytotoxic effects on a PDAC cell 
line highly resistant to gemcitabine that was selected after prolonged exposure 
to the drug. Notably, we found that combined treatment with gemcitabine and 
nab-paclitaxel exerted additive effects on cell death, even at lower doses of 
the drugs. The combined treatment caused an increase in cell death by apoptosis 
and in cell cycle blockage in S phase, as assessed by flow cytometry and western 
blot analysis of the PARP-1 cleavage. These results revealed that a combined 
treatment with nab-paclitaxel may overcome resistance to gemcitabine and may 
represent a valuable therapeutic approach for PDAC.

Effects of Resistance Training on Fatigue-Related Domains of Quality of Life and 
Mood During Pregnancy: A Randomized Trial in Pregnant Women With Increased Risk 
of Back Pain.

(Ward-Ritacco), University of Rhode Island, Kingston.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to test whether the adoption of twice 
weekly, low-to-moderate intensity resistance training during weeks 22 to 34 of 
pregnancy can improve quality of life and mood.
METHODS: A parallel-group trial was conducted. Women in their second trimester 
(N = 134) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of wait list, bimonthly pregnancy 
education classes, or twice weekly low-to-moderate intensity resistance 
training. Resistance training involved one abdominal exercise with no external 
load and five exercises (leg extension, leg press, arm lat pull, leg curl, and 
lumbar extension) with an external load that gradually progressed, and the total 
active exercise time during each exercise session was approximately 17 minutes. 
Quality of life and mood were measured before and after the interventions using 
the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and Profile of Mood States. Intent-to-treat 
mixed-model analyses of variance (3 groups by 2 times, pre- and 
postintervention) tested the hypothesis that outcomes would worsen for the 
controls and not change or improve for the resistance training group.
RESULTS: The group by time interaction (F(2,131) = 3.144, η = .046, p = .046) 
for 36-item Short Form Health Survey vitality and subsequent simple main effects 
showed that scores were unchanged across time after resistance training (-1.8 
(14.8)) but significantly decreased for the education (-6.44 (12.69), t = 3.408, 
df = 44, p = .001) and wait list (-9.11 (14.78), t = 4.135, df = 44, p < .001) 
groups, whereas posttest vitality scores for the pregnancy group (45.9 (16.9)) 
were significantly higher than the wait list (40.1 (16.3), t = 1.989, df = 87, p 
= .05) but not the education group (42.1 (15.4), p = .27). Profile of mood 
states fatigue scores showed a similar pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: Adverse changes in symptoms of energy and fatigue during pregnancy 
are attenuated by adopting low-to-moderate intensity resistance training.

Comprehensive investigations into the mortality outcomes of elite athletes can 
assist in decoding risk factors for premature mortality and provide avenues for 
exploring human health through engagement in sport. As such, the purpose of this 
study was to comprehensively examine lifespan trends of athletes from the 4 
major sports in North America: Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball 
Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League 
(NHL). We hypothesized that proportional death rates would be similar across the 
4 sports, when standardizing the data by debut years. Overall, 17 523 of 50 515 
(34.7%) athletes were deceased as of the respective data collection cutoff date 
for their sport, with MLB players having the highest risk of imminent mortality. 
Professional basketball players generally had the highest relative proportion of 
death when standardizing data by debut year, although NHL and NFL players who 
debuted after 2005 had the highest proportion of death. In addition, a 1-year 
increase in career length significantly decreased the risk of death (HR: 0.982, 
95% CI: 0.978-0.985), even after adjusting for sport type (HR: 0.977, 95% CI: 
0.974-0.980). Meaningful significance should be considered given the historical 
and unique nature of the sample. Nevertheless, investigating risk of death 
differences through different occupational and biological variables can help 
highlight aversive trends to lifespan that permeate throughout high-performance 
athlete populations.

[A Case Report on Successful Larynx-Preserving Surgery for a Cervical Esophageal 
Cancer That Invaded the Hypopharynx].

The patient was a 58-year-old man suffering from dysphagia. He was diagnosed 
with T3 cervicalesophagealcancer that invaded the posterior hypopharyngealwal 
lwith lymph node metastasis. The patient received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
(30 Gy with CDDP/5-FU), followed by larynx-preserving surgery(LPS)for 
cervicalesophagealcancer. Two techniques for successfulLPS consist of the 
dissections of cricopharyngealmuscl e and the inferior pharyngealsphincter, and 
the complete division of the bilateral infrahyoid muscles attached to the 
sternum(CDBIMS). The former technique of releasing the esophagus from the 
trachea at the cricoid cartilage level results in the extension of the oral 
surgical margin. The latter technique is expected to prevent postoperative 
aspiration pneumonia, as the lack of flexibility of scarred infrahyoid muscles 
is regarded as one of the major causes of dysfunction in swallowing. Free 
jejunum was transferred for cervical reconstruction. Pathological examination 
indicated degenerated squamous cell carcinoma(ypT2, INF b, ly0, v0, PM0, ypN0, 
ypStage II A). Although the patient had recurrent nerve palsy, he could eat 
meals without aspiration. He returned to normal life after discharge from the 
hospital. Five years after surgery, no recurrence had been observed.

BACKGROUND: HTA Programme funding is governed by the need for evidence and 
scientific quality, reflecting funding of the National Institute for Health 
Research (NIHR) by the NHS. The need criterion incorporates covering the 
spectrum of diseases, but also taking account of research supported by other 
funders. This study compared the NIHR HTA Programme portfolio of research with 
the UK burden of disease as measured by Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study using a cohort of all funded 
primary research and evidence syntheses projects received by the HTA Programme 
from April 2011 to March 2016 (n = 363); to determine the proportion of spend by 
disease compared with burden of disease in the UK calculated using 2015 UK DALY 
data.
RESULTS: The programme costing just under £44 million broadly reflected UK DALY 
burden by disease. Spend was lower than disease burden for cancer, 
cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases, which may reflect the importance of 
other funders, notably medical charities, which concentrate on these diseases.
CONCLUSION: The HTA Programme spend, adjusted for other relevant funders, 
broadly matches disease burden in the UK; no diseases are being neglected.

While the impact of the timeliness of vaccine administration has been 
well-studied for childhood vaccinations, there has been little detailed 
quantitative analysis on the potential impact of the timeliness of vaccinations 
in older adults. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of implementing 
more realistic observed uptake distributions, taking into the account reduced 
vaccine efficacy but higher pneumococcal disease burden with increasing age 
beyond 65 years. A multi-cohort Markov model was constructed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of a pneumococcal (PCV13) immunisation program in Australia, 
assuming two different uptake modelling approaches. The approach using an 
estimate of observed uptake was compared with a scenario in which the total 
cumulative uptake was delivered at the recommended age of vaccination. We found 
these two approaches produced different results both in terms of cases prevented 
and cost-effectiveness. The impact of the non-timely uptake in adult programs 
may sometimes have positive and other times negative effects, depending on 
several factors including the age-specific disease rates and the duration of 
vaccine protection. Our study highlights the importance of using realistic 
assumptions around uptake (including non-timely vaccination) when estimating the 
impact of vaccination in adults.

PURPOSE: Substantial gap formation of a repaired finger flexor tendon is assumed 
to be harmful for tendon healing. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
the relationship between gap formation and the failure of the repair during 
cyclic loading.
METHODS: Thirty-five porcine flexor tendons were repaired and tested cyclically 
using variable forces until failure or a maximum of 500 cycles. Depending on the 
biomechanical behavior during cyclic testing, specimens were divided into 3 
groups: Sustained (no failure), Fatigued (failure after 50 cycles), and 
Disrupted (failure before 50 cycles). The relationships between the gap 
formations, time-extension curves, and group assignments of the samples were 
investigated.
RESULTS: The time-extension curves of the Fatigued specimens showed a sudden 
onset of repair elongation-a fatigue point-which preluded the subsequent failure 
of the repair. This point coincides with the start of plastic deformation and, 
thereafter, cumulative injury of the repair consistently led to failure of the 
repair during subsequent cycles. None of the sustained repairs showed a fatigue 
point or substantial gapping during loading.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the emergence of a fatigue point and subsequent 
gap formation during loading will lead to failure of the repair if loading is 
continued.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this experimental study imply that an 
inadequate flexor tendon repair that is susceptible to gap formation is under 
risk of failure.
