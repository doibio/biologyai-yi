disorders (ASDs) that incorporates costs is lacking due to the scarcity of 
information on health utility scores or preference-weighted outcomes typically 
used for calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This study created 
algorithms for mapping clinical and behavioral measures for children with ASDs 
to health utility scores. The algorithms could be useful for estimating the 
value of different interventions and treatments used in the care of children 
with ASDs. Participants were recruited from two Autism Treatment Network sites. 
Health utility data based on the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) for the 
child were obtained from the primary caregiver (proxy-reported) through a survey 
(N = 224). During the initial clinic visit, proxy-reported measures of the Child 
Behavior Checklist, Vineland II Adaptive Behavior Scales, and the Pediatric 
Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (start measures) were obtained and then merged 
with the survey data. Nine mapping algorithms were developed using the HUI3 
scores as dependent variables in ordinary least squares regressions along with 
the start measures, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, to measure 
severity, child age, and cognitive ability as independent predictors. In-sample 
cross-validation was conducted to evaluate predictive accuracy. Multiple 
imputation techniques were used for missing data. The average age for children 
with ASDs in this study was 8.4 (standard deviation = 3.5) years. Almost half of 
the children (47%) had cognitive impairment (IQ ≤ 70). Total scores for all of 
the outcome measures were significantly associated with the HUI3 score. The 
algorithms can be applied to clinical studies containing start measures of 
children with ASDs to predict QALYs gained from interventions.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-related vasculitis is a systemic 
small-vessel vasculitis, including 3 clinical syndromes: granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis, known as Wegener&#039;s granulomatosis (WG), microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA) and the Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). ANCA-related vasculitis 
usually presents with severe kidney or pulmonary disease, has a mortality of 28% 
at 5 years, and also contributes to increased morbidity in vasculitis patients. 
Cardiac involvement in this entity may have different forms, including coronary 
vessels, pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, myocardial infarction and 
subendocardial vasculitis that can contribute to reduced life expectancy. 
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance using oedema and fibrosis imaging can early 
reveal, noninvasively and without radiation, heart involvement during 
vasculitis, undetected by other imaging techniques and guide further risk 
stratification and treatment of these patients.

Chitosan has been studied as a renewable polymer to form edible films allowing 
the incorporation of functional compounds. The aim of this work was to evaluate 
the effects in the chitosan films properties of the incorporation of grape 
pomace extracts: 0.15% of hot water extract (mainly polysaccharides), 0.15 and 
0.3% of chloroform extract (wax), and 0.3 and 0.75% of n-hexane extract (oil). 
The evaluation of the surface morphology revealed that the films with the 
aqueous extract had the most homogeneous and smoother topography. The 
incorporation of higher proportion of wax and oil led to changes in mechanical 
properties of the films, namely lower resistance and stiffness. The 
chitosan-based films with 0.75% oil demonstrated a 75% decrease of solubility in 
water, due to their hydrophobicity, as confirmed by the contact angle and 
surface free energy measurements. The hydrophobic films showed higher 
antioxidant capacity in organic medium (ABTS and DPPH assays) whereas the most 
hydrophilic films showed an improvement in FRAP and reducing power assays. 
Therefore, all the chitosan-based films prepared by incorporation of these grape 
pomace extracts are promising for food shelf life extension.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), a common voice disorder 
that is not commonly referred for physical therapy intervention, is 
characterized by excessive muscle recruitment, resulting in incorrect vibratory 
patterns of vocal folds and an alteration in voice production. This case series 
was conducted to determine whether physical therapy including manual therapy, 
exercise, and stress management education would be beneficial to this population 
by reducing excess muscle tension.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Nine patients with MTD completed a minimum of 9 sessions of 
the intervention. Patient-reported outcomes of pain, function, and quality of 
life were assessed at baseline and the conclusion of treatment. The outcome 
measures were the numeric rating scale (NRS), Patient-Specific Functional Scale 
(PSFS), and Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Cervical and jaw range of motion also 
were assessed at baseline and postintervention using standard goniometric 
measurements.
OUTCOMES: Eight of the patients had no pain after treatment. All 9 of the 
patients demonstrated an improvement in PSFS score, with 7 patients exceeding a 
clinically meaningful improvement at the conclusion of the intervention. Three 
of the patients also had a clinically meaningful change in VHI scores. All 9 of 
the patients demonstrated improvement in cervical flexion and lateral flexion 
and jaw opening, whereas 8 patients improved in cervical extension and rotation 
postintervention.
DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that physical therapists can feasibly implement 
an intervention to improve outcomes in patients with MTD. However, a randomized 
clinical trial is needed to confirm the results of this case series and the 
efficacy of the intervention. A clinical implication is the expansion of 
physical therapy to include referrals from voice centers for the treatment of 
MTD.

Long-term survival with peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis from intraductal 
mucinous papillary pancreatic carcinoma treated with complete cytoreduction and 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

Traditionally, peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) was regarded as an untreatable 
condition; however, the introduction of locoregional therapies combining 
cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) 
approximately two decades ago has changed this view. There is controversy, 
however, when a PC arises from pancreatic cancer. We have reported on an 
extraordinary case of an aggressive pseudomixoma peritonei arising from an 
invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) treated with complete 
cytoreduction and HIPEC. This combination of treatments has not been previously 
described. Moreover, a very long-term disease-free survival of up to 70 months 
has been achieved by this combined approach. This approach may provide some 
optimism for considerable life extension in selected patients who present with 
an aggressive peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis of pancreatic origin considered 
suitable only for palliative care.

BACKGROUND: Many mental health surveys and clinical studies do not include a 
multi-attribute utility instrument (MAUI) that produces quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). There is also some question about the sensitivity of the 
existing utility instruments to mental health.
AIMS: To compare the sensitivity of five commonly used MAUIs (Assessment of 
Quality of Life - Eight Dimension Scale (AQoL-8D), EuroQoL-five dimension 
(EQ-5D-5L), Short Form 6D (SF-6D), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), 15D) 
with that of disease-specific depression outcome measures (Depression Anxiety 
Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)) and 
develop 'crosswalk' transformation algorithms between the measures.
METHOD: Individual data from 917 people with self-report depression collected as 
part of the International Multi-Instrument Comparison Survey.
RESULTS: All the MAUIs discriminated between the levels of severity measured by 
the K10 and the DASS-21. The AQoL-8D had the highest correlation with the 
disease-specific measures and the best goodness-of-fit transformation 
properties.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithms developed in this study can be used to determine 
cost-effectiveness of services or interventions where utility measures are not 
collected.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is a rare and severe hereditary 
lipid disorder that is typically associated with high serum levels of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Excessive exposure to high levels 
of LDL-C puts affected individuals at very high risk of premature onset coronary 
heart disease, and this considerably limits life expectancy. Although the 
clinical features and treatment of HoFH have been extensively researched, 
societal and socio-psychological impacts of the disease have not been reported 
to date. The current study was conducted to investigate the burden of disease 
and treatment from the patient's perspective by means of semi-structured 
interviews with 24 HoFH patients. The findings of the survey indicate that HoFH 
represents a considerable burden for patients, not only due to physical signs 
and limitations caused by the disease but also a number of psychosocial factors, 
treatment-related issues and impact on their education and employment situation.

Biomedical research has led to profound advances in the treatment of HIV 
infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) now provides the means to 
readily control viral infection, and people living with HIV who receive timely 
and effective ART can expect to benefit from a life expectancy comparable to 
uninfected individuals. Nevertheless, despite effective treatment, ART does not 
fully restore the immune system and importantly HIV persists indefinitely in 
latent reservoirs, resulting in the need for life-long treatment. The challenges 
and limits of life-long treatment have spurred significant scientific interest 
and global investment into research towards an HIV cure. The International AIDS 
Society (IAS) 2014 Towards an HIV cure symposium brought together researchers 
and community to discuss the most recent advances in our understanding of 
latency and HIV reservoirs, and the clinical approaches towards an HIV cure 
under current investigation. This report summarizes and reviews some of the 
major findings discussed during the symposium.

The Golgi apparatus was dramatically disassembled when cells were incubated in a 
low pH medium. The cis-Golgi disassembled quickly, extended tubules and spread 
to the periphery of cells within 30 min. In contrast, medial- and trans-Golgi 
were fragmented in significantly larger structures of smaller numbers at a 
slower rate and remained largely in structures distinct from the cis-Golgi. 
Electron microscopy revealed the complete disassembly of the Golgi stack in low 
pH treated cells. The effect of low pH was reversible; the Golgi apparatus 
reassembled to form a normal ribbon-like structure within 1-2h after the 
addition of a control medium. The anterograde ER to Golgi transport and 
retrograde Golgi to ER transport were both reduced under low pH. Phospholipase 
A2 inhibitors (ONO, BEL) effectively suppressed the Golgi disassembly, 
suggesting that the phospholipase A2 was involved in the Golgi disassembly. 
Over-expression of Rab1, 2, 30, 33 and 41 also suppressed the Golgi disassembly 
under low pH, suggesting that they have protective role against Golgi 
disassembly. Low pH treatment reduced cytoplasmic pH, but not the luminal pH of 
the Golgi apparatus, strongly suggesting that reduction of the cytoplasmic pH 
triggered the Golgi disassembly. Because a lower cytoplasmic pH is induced in 
physiological or pathological conditions, disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and 
reduction of vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus may play important 
roles in cell physiology and pathology. Furthermore, our findings indicated that 
low pH treatment can serve as an important tool to analyze the molecular 
mechanisms that support the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus.

BACKGROUND: Health-related fitness has been reported to be associated with 
improved quality of life (QoL) in the elderly. Health-related fitness is 
comprised of several dimensions that could be enhanced by specific training 
regimens. It has remained unclear how various dimensions of health-related 
fitness interact with QoL in postmenopausal women.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship 
between the dimensions of health-related fitness and QoL in elderly women.
METHODS: A cohort of 408 postmenopausal women in a rural area of Taiwan was 
prospectively collected. Dimensions of health-related fitness, consisting of 
muscular strength, balance, cardiorespiratory endurance, flexibility, muscle 
endurance, and agility, were assessed. QoL was determined using the Short Form 
Health Survey (SF-36). Differences between age groups (stratified by decades) 
were calculated using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple 
comparisons using a Scheffé test. A Spearman's correlation analysis was 
performed to examine differences between QoL and each dimension of fitness. 
Multiple linear regression with forced-entry procedure was performed to evaluate 
the effects of health-related fitness. A P-value of <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: Age-related decreases in health-related fitness were shown for sit-ups, 
back strength, grip strength, side steps, trunk extension, and agility (P<0.05). 
An age-related decrease in QoL, specifically in physical functioning, role 
limitation due to physical problems, and physical component score, was also 
demonstrated (P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that 
back strength significantly contributed to the physical component of QoL 
(adjusted beta of 0.268 [P<0.05]).
CONCLUSION: Back strength was positively correlated with the physical component 
of QoL among the examined dimensions of health-related fitness. Health-related 
fitness, as well as the physical component of QoL, declined with increasing age.

52074 Aachen, Germany.

CONTEXT: Recent trial results have revived interest in low-activity initial 
(131)I therapy (RIT) of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare different initial (131)I activities for 
outcome.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A database study was performed in a University hospital.
PATIENTS: 1298 DTC patients were included (698 low risk, 434 high risk M0, and 
136 M1), grouped according to ablation activity (I, ≤ 2000 MBq [54 mCi]; II, 
2000-3000 MBq [54-81 mCi]; and III, >3000 MBq [81 mCi]), subdivided by age (<45 
and ≥ 45 y at diagnosis).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete remission (CR, defined as thyroglobulin [Tg] 
below functional sensitivity combined with visually negative (131)I diagnostic 
whole-body scintigraphy), recurrence, DTC-specific mortality, and relative 
survival rates were studied.
RESULTS: Low-risk patients: In patients <45 years, a lower median cumulative 
activity was required to achieve CR in group III (3590 MBq) than in groups I 
(8050 MBq) and II (6300 MBq). In patients at least 45 years of age, DTC-specific 
mortality was significantly higher in group I than in groups II and III (15-y: 
16.1 ± 7.7%, 0.8 ± 0.8%, and 7.2 ± 5.5%, respectively; P = .004). High-risk M0 
patients: In patients at least 45 years of age, the recurrence rate (15-y: 44.4 
± 16.6%, 24.1 ± 7.6%, and 8.6 ± 3.9%; P = .001) and DTC-specific mortality 
(15-y: 51.8 ± 15.8%, 13.2 ± 4.4%, and 9.5 ± 3.7%; P = .004) were significantly 
higher in group I than in groups II and III. M1 patients: There were no 
significant differences in survival results between different activity groups in 
either age category.
CONCLUSION: Before adopting low initial activity RIT for, especially older, 
low-risk patients, results of long-term followup should be regarded critically. 
Low-activity RIT in older, high-risk patients is not to be recommended.

BACKGROUND: Rigidity is a cardinal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). There 
are few studies that have assessed rigidity with objective tools in PD patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an objective measurement to quantify 
trunk rigidity in PD patients with a technology device and to investigate the 
relationship between this objective assessment and to examine its relationship 
with disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr staging score and the Unified Parkinson's 
Disease Rating Scale III) disease duration, functional status (Schwab & England 
activities of daily living scale) and health related quality of life (European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimensions and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items) in 
patients with mild to moderate PD.
METHODS: An isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System 3 was employed to assess trunk 
rigidity in 36 PD patients. Passive trunk flexion and extension at 3 angular 
velocities, 30°/s, 45°/s and 60°/s were applied and resistive torques were 
recorded as trunk flexor and extensors rigidity.
RESULTS: Significant correlations between trunk flexors-extensors tone and 
clinical status, disease duration and functional status at 30°/s, 45°/s and 
60°/s were obtained. No correlations were found among trunk muscle tone assessed 
with the isokinetic dynamometer and the EuroQoL-5D. Trunk rigidity was 
correlated with the HRQoL assessed with the mobility, cognition and stigma 
PDQ-39 domains and the total PDQ-39 scores.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the 30°/s, 45°/s and 60°/s angular 
velocities of this objective technology method were a valid assessment for trunk 
rigidity and were correlated with disease severity, disease duration, functional 
status and HRQoL in PD patients.

POPULATION: All prevalent cases of selected congenital anomalies at birth in 
2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
INTERVENTIONS AND METHODS: Surgical programmes for three congenital conditions 
were analysed: clefts (lip and palate); congenital heart anomalies; and neural 
tube defects. Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study were used to 
estimate the combination of fatal burden that could be addressed by surgical 
care and the additional long-term non-fatal burden associated with increased 
survival.
RESULTS: Of the estimated 21.6 million DALYs caused by these three conditions in 
LMICs, 12.4 million DALYs (57%) are potentially addressable by surgical care 
among the population born with such conditions. Neural tube defects have the 
largest potential with 76% of burden amenable by surgery, followed by clefts 
(59%) and congenital heart anomalies (49%). Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia 
have the greatest proportion of surgically addressable burden for clefts (68%), 
North Africa and Middle East for congenital heart anomalies (73%), and South 
Asia for neural tube defects (81%).
CONCLUSIONS: There is an important and neglected role surgical programmes can 
play in reducing the burden of congenital anomalies in LMICs.

Copenhagen, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: The population of Greenland comprises almost 31,000 Inuit 
Greenlanders aged 20-65. The purpose of this study was to estimate trends in 
expected life years between age 20 and 65 in good and poor health, and to 
compare changes between men and women since the mid-1990s.
METHODS: Partial life expectancy was calculated and combined with prevalence 
data on self-rated health, longstanding illness and musculoskeletal diseases 
derived from health surveys carried out in 1993-94, 1999-2001 and 2005-10. 
Trends for men and women were compared and changes were decomposed into 
contributions from changes in mortality and disability.
RESULTS: Partial life expectancy increased by 2.2 years for men and 0.8 years 
for women during the entire period. However, expected lifetime in self-rated 
good health decreased by 3.3 years for men and by 4.6 years for women (p<0.01). 
For men, life expectancy without longstanding illness increased by 4.7 years 
(p<0.001). The increase for women by 1.4 years was non-significant (p=0.29). 
Expected lifetime without musculoskeletal diseases increased significantly by 
4.5 years for men and by 1.9 years for women.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of expected lifetime without longstanding illness 
supports the theory of compression of morbidity, but as the trend direction 
differs according to which measure for health is used, a definite conclusion 
cannot be drawn. The different rate of development of partial life expectancy 
and expected lifetime in good health between men and women is remarkable, and 
has reduced the gender gap. The results call for special concern about the 
women's health in Greenland.

We aimed to consolidate all epidemiologic data about severe periodontitis (SP) 
and, subsequently, to generate internally consistent prevalence and incidence 
estimates for all countries, 20 age groups, and both sexes for 1990 and 2010. 
The systematic search of the literature yielded 6,394 unique citations. After 
screening titles and abstracts, we excluded 5,881 citations as clearly not 
relevant to this systematic review, leaving 513 for full-text review. A further 
441 publications were excluded following the validity assessment. A total of 72 
studies, including 291,170 individuals aged 15 yr or older in 37 countries, were 
included in the metaregression based on modeling resources of the Global Burden 
of Disease 2010 Study. SP was the sixth-most prevalent condition in the world. 
Between 1990 and 2010, the global age-standardized prevalence of SP was static 
at 11.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 10.4%-11.9% in 1990 and 10.5%-12.0% in 
2010). The age-standardized incidence of SP in 2010 was 701 cases per 100,000 
person-years (95% uncertainty interval: 599-823), a nonsignificant increase from 
the 1990 incidence of SP. Prevalence increased gradually with age, showing a 
steep increase between the third and fourth decades of life that was driven by a 
peak in incidence at around 38 yr of age. There were considerable variations in 
prevalence and incidence between regions and countries. Policy makers need to be 
aware of a predictable increasing burden of SP due to the growing world 
population associated with an increasing life expectancy and a significant 
decrease in the prevalence of total tooth loss throughout the world from 1990 to 
2010.

BACKGROUND: Depression and headache are highly prevalent in clinical settings. 
The co-occurrence of headache may impact choice of antidepressants, healthcare 
utilisation, and outcomes in patients with depression. The current study aims to 
examine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different antidepressants for 
treating patients with depression and comorbid headache disorders.
METHODS: Adult patients prescribed with antidepressants for depression 
(n=96,501) were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database 
in Taiwan. A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis was conducted 
comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants 
(TCAs), and by the presence of comorbid headache disorders and other pain 
conditions.
RESULTS: In this study, SSRIs dominated SNRIs in both cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility. As revealed in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, TCAs 
were likely to have a cost-utility advantage compared to SSRIs and SNRIs in 
improving quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients with comorbid 
headache; SSRIs remained as the most cost-effective option for patients with 
other pain conditions.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the use of proxy definition of remission as 
effectiveness measure and the adoption of utility values from previous studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Given a pre-determined willingness-to-pay level, TCAs can be 
considered as a cost-effective option to improve QALYs for depressed patients 
with headache disorders. Future research is needed to further clarify factors 
influencing the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of pharmacological 
treatments in depressed patients with specific pain conditions.

Kayseri, Turkey.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics, management approaches and 
life expectancy in pediatric patients with neuroepithelial glial tumors except 
ependymal tumors.
METHODS: Between January 2003 and August 2008, 48 patients (30 boys, 18 girls; 
mean age: 10.9 ± 4.6 years) who were diagnosed with neuroepithelial glial tumors 
except ependymal tumors and underwent curative radiotherapy (RT) for inoperable, 
postoperative adjuvant or palliative for residual/recurrent disease at Dr. 
Abdurahman Yurtsalan Ankara Oncology Education and Research Hospital, Radiation 
Oncology Clinic, were retrospectively analyzed. Progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in relation to sex, previous surgical 
procedure, pathological diagnosis, low/high grade and the histopathological 
grade of disease.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 28.8 ± 4.8 months. The mean and median PFS were 
36.2 months and 20 months, respectively, while mean and median OS were 40.3 
months and 23 months, respectively. One-year PFS and OS were 65.8% and 71%, 
respectively, whereas 3-year PFS and OS were 36.3% and 42.3%, respectively. 
Univariate Cox regression model and Log-Rank test revealed no statistical 
significance. Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in boys compared to girls, 
those who underwent total/gross total resection compared to subtotal resection, 
those with low grade tumors compared to high-grade tumors, and those with 
histopathological grade I disease compared to grade IV disease (p>0.05). The PFS 
and OS times were shortened in patients who developed side effects at any time 
following surgery and RT, compared to those without any side effects (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Low-grade disease and total/gross total resection prolong PFS and OS 
in patients with childhood glial tumors.

morbidity framework.

BACKGROUND: As originally proposed by Fries, conceptualizing morbidity solely 
through associated functional limitation/disability (FL/D) remains the most 
widely accepted metric to assess whether increases in longevity have been 
accompanied by a compression of morbidity.
OBJECTIVE: To propose a departure from a highly restrictive FL/D-based 
definition of "morbidity" to a broader view that considers the burden of chronic 
diseases even when no overt FL/D occur.
DESIGN: We outline three reasons why the current framework of compression of 
morbidity should be broadened to also consider morbidity to be present even when 
there are no overtly measurable FL/D. We discuss various scenarios of morbidity 
compression and morbidity expansion under this broader rubric of morbidity.
CONCLUSION: The rationale to go beyond a purely FL/D-based definition of 
morbidity includes: (1) substantial damage from chronic disease that can develop 
prior to overt FL/D symptoms occurring; (2) multiple costs to the individual and 
society that extend beyond FL/D, including medication costs, health care visits, 
and opportunity costs of lifelong treatment; and (3) psychosocial and stress 
burden of being labeled as diseased and the consequence for overall well-being. 
Adopting this broader definition of morbidity suggests that increases in 
longevity have been possibly accompanied by an expansion of morbidity, in 
contrast to Fries' original hypothesis that morbidity onset (based on only FL/D) 
would be delayed to a greater extent than increases in survival. There is an 
urgent need for better data and more research to document morbidity onset and 
its link with increases in longevity and assess the important question on 
whether populations while living longer are also healthier.

Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with 
increased prevalence in the aging population. It is estimated that approximately 
1.5 million individuals in the US alone suffer from Parkinson's disease and with 
the extension of life expectancy this number is expected to rise dramatically 
within the next twenty-five years. The majority of Parkinson's disease cases are 
sporadic. But mutations in genes such as α-synuclein, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and 
LRRK2, have been conclusively associated with both early- and late-onset of the 
disease. Although the genetics of Parkinson's disease is starting to become 
unraveled, the interplay between genetic and environmental factors is largely 
unknown as are the underlying mechanisms that trigger the disease as the brain 
ages. The risk of Parkinson's disease increases dramatically in individuals over 
the age of 60 and it is estimated that more than 1% of all seniors have some 
form of the condition. In this review, we will highlight some of the central 
proteins associated with Parkinson's disease and how they may be linked to 
processes and factors associated with age.

University Hospital HF, Nydalen, Postbox 4950, Oslo, Norway. torfja@online.no.

BACKGROUND: Treatment for displaced proximal humeral fractures is still under 
debate. Few studies exist at the highest level of evidence. Although reversed 
total shoulder prosthesis has gained popularity and showed promising results in 
the treatment for proximal humeral fractures in the elderly patients, no 
randomized controlled trials exist to the authors' knowledge.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized semi-blinded controlled multicenter 
trial designed according to the Consort statement and the recommendations given 
by the Cochrane reviewers for proximal humeral fractures. The study will 
investigate whether a reversed total shoulder prosthetic replacement gain better 
functional outcome compared to open reduction and internal fixation using an 
angular stable plate in displaced three- and four parts proximal humeral 
fractures after two and five years follow-up.Participants are aged 65-85 
admitted in seven different hospitals with a displaced proximal humeral fracture 
according to AO-OTA type 11-B2 or 11-C2. The intervention group is surgical 
treatment using a reversed total shoulder prosthesis (Delta X-tend) compared to 
open reduction and internal fixation with an angular stable plate (Philos) and 
thread cerclage in the control group. 60 patients will be randomized to each 
group.The primary outcome is shoulder function (Constant score). Secondary 
outcomes will be patient self-assessment form (Oxford shoulder score), a quality 
of life questionnaire (15D score) and resource implications 
(cost-effectiveness). Follow-ups take place at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, and five 
years. The trial design is semi-blinded with blinded physiotherapists performing 
the functional testing of patients at all follow-ups.Randomization to treatment 
groups is electronic online, by independent supervisor (web-CRF). The 
recruitment of patients started at January 1.st 2013. Inclusion of 120 patients 
during three years is expected.
DISCUSSION: This semiblinded trial include a high number of patients compared to 
existing randomized trials in this field. To our knowledge and according to 
ClinicalTrials.gov, this is the first study that compare these two treatments 
for a displaced proximal humeral fracture in elderly patients. This may provide 
important information to help the surgeon to decide the best treatment in the 
future.

PrimPol is a primase-polymerase found in humans, and other eukaryotes, involved 
in bypassing lesions encountered during DNA replication. PrimPol employs both 
translesion synthesis and repriming mechanisms to facilitate lesion bypass by 
the replisome. PrimPol has been reported to be a potential susceptibility gene 
associated with the development of myopia. Mutation of tyrosine 89 to aspartic 
acid (PrimPolY89D) has been identified in a number of cases of high myopia, 
implicating it in the aetiology of this disorder. Here, we examined whether this 
mutation resulted in any changes in the molecular and cellular activities 
associated with human PrimPol. We show that PrimPolY89D has a striking decrease 
in primase and polymerase activities. The hydrophobic ring of tyrosine is 
important for retaining wild-type extension activity. We also demonstrate that 
the decreased activity of PrimPolY89D is associated with reduced affinities for 
DNA and nucleotides, resulting in diminished catalytic efficiency. Although the 
structure and stability of PrimPolY89D is altered, its fidelity remains 
unchanged. This mutation also reduces cell viability after DNA damage and 
significantly slows replication fork rates in vivo. Together, these findings 
establish that the major DNA replication defect associated with this PrimPol 
mutant is likely to contribute to the onset of high myopia.

Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a Web-based or print-delivered tailored 
intervention to promote physical activity among adults aged over fifty: an 
economic evaluation of the Active Plus intervention.

Golsteijn RH, Peels DA, Evers SM, Bolman C, Mudde AN, de Vries H, Lechner L.

BACKGROUND: The adverse health effects of insufficient physical activity (PA) 
result in high costs to society. The economic burden of insufficient PA, which 
increases in our aging population, stresses the urgency for cost-effective 
interventions to promote PA among older adults. The current study provides 
insight in the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different versions of a 
tailored PA intervention (Active Plus) among adults aged over fifty.
METHODS: The intervention conditions (i.e. print-delivered basic (PB; N = 439), 
print-delivered environmental (PE; N = 435), Web-based basic (WB; N = 423), 
Web-based environmental (WE; N = 432)) and a waiting-list control group were 
studied in a clustered randomized controlled trial. Intervention costs were 
registered during the trial. Health care costs, participant costs and 
productivity losses were identified and compared with the intervention effects 
on PA (in MET-hours per week) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 12 months 
after the start of the intervention. Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and 
cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated per intervention condition. 
Non-parametric bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses were performed 
to account for uncertainty.
RESULTS: As a whole (i.e. the four intervention conditions together) the Active 
Plus intervention was found to be cost-effective. The PB-intervention 
(ICER = €-55/MET-hour), PE-intervention (ICER = €-94/MET-hour) and the 
WE-intervention (ICER = €-139/MET-hour) all resulted in higher effects on PA and 
lower societal costs than the control group. With regard to QALYs, the 
PB-intervention (ICUR = €38,120/QALY), the PE-intervention 
(ICUR = €405,892/QALY) and the WE-intervention (ICUR = €-47,293/QALY) were found 
to be cost-effective when considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€20,000/QALY. In most cases PE had the highest probability to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The Active Plus intervention was found to be a cost-effective 
manner to increase PA in a population aged over fifty when compared to 
no-intervention. The tailored Active Plus intervention delivered through printed 
material and with additional environmental information (PE) turned out to be the 
most cost-effective intervention condition as confirmed by the different 
sensitivity analyses. By increasing PA at relatively low costs, the Active Plus 
intervention can contribute to a better public health.
