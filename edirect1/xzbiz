BACKGROUND: With the advent of effective antiretroviral treatment, the life 
expectancy for people with HIV is now approaching that seen in the general 
population. Consequently, the relative importance of other traditionally 
non-AIDS-related morbidities has increased. We investigated trends over time in 
all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in people with HIV from 
1999 to 2011.
METHODS: Individuals from the Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV 
Drugs (D:A:D) study were followed up from March, 1999, until death, loss to 
follow-up, or Feb 1, 2011, whichever occurred first. The D:A:D study is a 
collaboration of 11 cohort studies following HIV-1-positive individuals 
receiving care at 212 clinics in Europe, USA, and Australia. All fatal events 
were centrally validated at the D:A:D coordinating centre using coding causes of 
death in HIV (CoDe) methodology. We calculated relative rates using Poisson 
regression.
FINDINGS: 3909 of the 49,731 D:A:D study participants died during the 308,719 
person-years of follow-up (crude incidence mortality rate, 12.7 per 1000 
person-years [95% CI 12.3-13.1]). Leading underlying causes were: AIDS-related 
(1123 [29%] deaths), non-AIDS-defining cancers (590 [15%] deaths), liver disease 
(515 [13%] deaths), and cardiovascular disease (436 [11%] deaths). Rates of 
all-cause death per 1000 person-years decreased from 17.5 in 1999-2000 to 9.1 in 
2009-11; we saw similar decreases in death rates per 1000 person-years over the 
same period for AIDS-related deaths (5.9 to 2.0), deaths from liver disease (2.7 
to 0.9), and cardiovascular disease deaths (1.8 to 0.9). However, non-AIDS 
cancers increased slightly from 1.6 per 1000 person-years in 1999-2000 to 2.1 in 
2009-11 (p=0.58). After adjustment for factors that changed over time, including 
CD4 cell count, we detected no decreases in AIDS-related death rates (relative 
rate for 2009-11 vs 1999-2000: 0.92 [0.70-1.22]). However, all-cause (0.72 
[0.61-0.83]), liver disease (0.48 [0.32-0.74]), and cardiovascular disease (0.33 
[0.20-0.53) death rates still decreased over time. The percentage of all deaths 
that were AIDS-related (87/256 [34%] in 1999-2000 and 141/627 [22%] in 2009-11) 
and liver-related (40/256 [16%] in 1999-2000 and 64/627 [10%] in 2009-11) 
decreased over time, whereas non-AIDS cancers increased (24/256 [9%] in 
1999-2000 to 142/627 [23%] in 2009-11).
INTERPRETATION: Recent reductions in rates of AIDS-related deaths are linked 
with continued improvement in CD4 cell count. We hypothesise that the 
substantially reduced rates of liver disease and cardiovascular disease deaths 
over time could be explained by improved use of non-HIV-specific preventive 
interventions. Non-AIDS cancer is now the leading non-AIDS cause and without any 
evidence of improvement.

Subglottic granular cell tumors (GCT) are rare, potentially life threatening 
benign tumors. Complete resection is necessary, yet care must be taken to 
preserve laryngeal function. We present the first description of a pediatric 
subglottic GCT with extensive invasion beyond the confines of the subglottis to 
include the vocal folds and central neck. Urgent endoscopic debulking avoided 
tracheotomy and facilitated extubation. Later, complete resection required 
hemithyroidectomy, laryngofissure and partial cricotracheal resection. We 
conclude that endoscopic debulking is an appropriate initial treatment. 
Transmural extension should be suspected in tumors larger than 1cm and warn of 
the need for tracheal resection.

Model selection and diagnostics for joint modeling of survival and longitudinal 
data with crossing hazard rate functions.

Park KY(1), Qiu P.

U.S.A.

Comparison of two hazard rate functions is important for evaluating treatment 
effect in studies concerning times to some important events. In practice, it may 
happen that the two hazard rate functions cross each other at one or more 
unknown time points, representing temporal changes of the treatment effect. 
Also, besides survival data, there could be longitudinal data available 
regarding some time-dependent covariates. When jointly modeling the survival and 
longitudinal data in such cases, model selection and model diagnostics are 
especially important to provide reliable statistical analysis of the data, which 
are lacking in the literature. In this paper, we discuss several criteria for 
assessing model fit that have been used for model selection and apply them to 
the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data for comparing two crossing 
hazard rate functions. We also propose hypothesis testing and graphical methods 
for model diagnostics of the proposed joint modeling approach. Our proposed 
methods are illustrated by a simulation study and by a real-data example 
concerning two early breast cancer treatments.

Bone fractures markedly reduce quality of life and life expectancy in elderly 
people. Although osteoporosis increases bone fragility, fractures frequently 
occur in patients with normal bone mineral density. Because most fractures occur 
on falling, preventing falls is another focus for reducing bone fractures. In 
this study, we investigated the role of vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling in 
locomotive ability. In the rotarod test, physical exercise enhanced locomotive 
ability of wild-type (WT) mice by 1.6-fold, whereas exercise did not enhance 
locomotive ability of VDR knockout (KO) mice. Compared with WT mice, VDR KO mice 
had smaller peripheral nerve axonal diameter and disordered AChR morphology on 
the extensor digitorum longus muscle. Eldecalcitol (ED-71, ELD), an analog of 
1,25(OH)2 D3 , administered to rotarod-trained C57BL/6 mice enhanced locomotor 
performance compared with vehicle-treated nontrained mice. The area of AChR 
cluster on the extensor digitorum longus was greater in ELD-treated mice than in 
vehicle-treated mice. ELD and 1,25(OH)2 D3 enhanced expression of IGF-1, myelin 
basic protein, and VDR in rat primary Schwann cells. VDR signaling regulates 
neuromuscular maintenance and enhances locomotive ability after physical 
exercise. Further investigation is required, but Schwann cells and the 
neuromuscular junction are targets of vitamin D3 signaling in locomotive 
ability.

Hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement: a health economic analysis.

There has been a significant increase in use of hip arthroscopy for 
femoroacetabular impingement over the last 10 years. However, some care 
providers in the United Kingdom are not commissioning such an intervention due 
to cost constraints and lack of published cost effectiveness studies. A cost 
analysis for a prospective cohort of 58 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for 
femoroacetabular impingement was performed. The short form 12 six dimension 
health utility score (SF12-6D) was used. This was recorded preoperatively and 
one year after surgery. Three time points (one, two, and 10 years) from 
operation were used to calculate the quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) gained. 
Predicted need for conversion to total hip replacement and diminishing gain with 
time (5% per year) was incorporated into the two- and 10-year models. The 
Scottish Tariff was used to assign the cost of surgery. The number of QALYs 
gained one year after surgery was 0.159, which equated to a cost per QALY of 
£19,335. This cost decreased to £10,118 per QALY gained at two years, and 
further still to £2,677 per QALY gained at 10 years. Multivariable regression 
analysis found that a worse preoperative SF12-6D was an independent predictor of 
greater QALYs gained one year after surgery (R² = 0.51, p<0.001). At no point in 
time, from one year onwards, does hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular 
impingement cost more than £20,000 per QALY, making it a cost-effective 
intervention according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical 
Excellence.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, and the most 
prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. The prevalence of AD is 
predicted to rise as life expectancy grows across populations. The exact cause 
of this devastating disease is still unknown; however, it is an aging-related 
multi-factorial disorder, and growing evidence supports the contribution of 
modifiable environmental factors to unmodifiable factors such as gene and ageing 
itself. The recent advancement of methodologies and techniques for early 
diagnosis of AD facilitates the investigation of strategies to reduce the risk 
for AD progression in the earliest stages of the disease. Pharmacological 
attempts at curing, halting or modifying it have, by and large, been 
unsuccessful, and no breakthrough is seen in the near future. However, a lot of 
elements that seem to contribute to the disease such as risk factors have been 
identified, mainly from epidemiological and basic research studies. Many of 
these are amenable to lifestyle modification. Therefore, prevention in the 
preclinical stage is likely the most effective way to decrease the incidence of 
this age-associated dreadful neurodegenerative condition, and its associated 
burden for individuals and society. We provide an overview of modifiable risk 
factors for AD along with the supporting evidence.

Carotid revascularization: risks and benefits.

O'Brien M(1), Chandra A(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, Division of Vascular Surgery, University of Rochester 
School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.

Despite a decline during the recent decades in stroke-related death, the 
incidence of stroke has remained unchanged or slightly increased, and 
extracranial carotid artery stenosis is implicated in 20%-30% of all strokes. 
Medical therapy and risk factor modification are first-line therapies for all 
patients with carotid occlusive disease. Evidence for the treatment of patients 
with symptomatic carotid stenosis greater than 70% with either carotid artery 
stenting (CAS) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is compelling, and several trials 
have demonstrated a benefit to carotid revascularization in the symptomatic 
patient population. Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is more controversial, with 
the largest trials only demonstrating a 1% per year risk stroke reduction with 
CEA. Although there are sufficient data to advocate for aggressive medical 
therapy as the primary mode of treatment for asymptomatic carotid stenosis, 
there are also data to suggest that certain patient populations will benefit 
from a stroke risk reduction with carotid revascularization. In the United 
States, consensus and practice guidelines dictate that CEA is reasonable in 
patients with high-grade asymptomatic stenosis, a reasonable life expectancy, 
and perioperative risk of less than 3%. Regarding CAS versus CEA, the 
best-available evidence demonstrates no difference between the two procedures in 
early perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, and no difference 
in 4-year ipsilateral stroke risk. However, because of the higher perioperative 
risks of stroke in patients undergoing CAS, particularly in symptomatic, female, 
or elderly patients, it is difficult to recommend CAS over CEA except in 
populations with prohibitive cardiac risk, previous carotid surgery, or prior 
neck radiation. Current treatment paradigms are based on identifying the 
magnitude of perioperative risk in patient subsets and on using predictive 
factors to stratify patients with high-risk asymptomatic stenosis.

PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of nephron-sparing options (e.g., partial 
nephrectomy [PN]) and low-surgical-morbidity options (e.g., radical nephrectomy 
[RN]) in elderly patients with limited life expectancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 135 patients aged 70 years or 
older who underwent RN (n=82) or PN (n=53) for clinical T1 stage renal masses 
between January 2000 and December 2012. Clinicopathologic data were thoroughly 
analyzed and compared between the RN and PN groups. The modification of diet in 
renal disease equation was used to estimate glomerular filtration. Overall 
survival and cardiac events were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 59.72 months, 17 patients (20.7%) in 
the RN group and 3 patients (5.7%) in the PN group died. Chronic kidney disease 
(<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) developed more frequently in RN patients than in PN 
patients (75.6% vs. 41.5%, p<0.001). The 5-year overall survival rate did not 
differ significantly between the RN and PN groups (90.7% vs. 93.8%; p=0.158). 
According to the multivariate analysis, the Charlson comorbidity index score was 
an independent predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.679, 
p=0.037). Type of nephrectomy was not significantly associated with overall 
survival (HR, 2.447; p=0.167) or cardiac events (HR, 1.147; p=0.718).
CONCLUSIONS: Although chronic kidney disease was lower after PN, overall 
survival and cardiac events were similar regardless of type of nephrectomy.

Patients with breast cancer and bone metastases often experience skeletal 
complications (skeletal-related events [SREs]: pathologic fracture, radiation to 
bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression). Prospective data on the 
health resource burden of SREs are needed for planning healthcare requirements 
and estimating the value of new treatments, but limited data are available. This 
prospective, observational study collected health resource utilization (HRU) 
data independently attributed to SREs by investigators. Eligible patients had 
bone metastases secondary to breast cancer, life expectancy ≥6 months, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2, and at least one SRE in 
the 97 days before enrollment. Data, collected retrospectively for 97 days 
before enrollment and prospectively for 18-21 months, included number and 
duration of inpatient stays, outpatient visits, emergency room visits and 
procedures. Altogether, 223 patients were enrolled from Germany, Italy, Spain 
and the UK. Of the 457 SREs, 118 (25.8%) were associated with inpatient stays. 
The mean duration of stay was 19.5 (standard deviation [SD] 19.2) days per SRE 
(based on 117 SREs). Surgery to bone and spinal cord compression were the SREs 
most likely to require inpatient stays (77.8% and 57.9% of SREs, respectively), 
while radiation to bone was the least likely (9.7%). Spinal cord compression 
required the longest inpatient stay per event (34.2 [SD 30.2] days) and 
radiation to bone the shortest (14.3 [SD 10.2] days). Overall, 342 SREs (74.8%) 
required an outpatient visit, with radiation to bone the most likely (85.7%), 
and surgery to bone the least likely (42.6%). Radiation to bone was also 
associated with the greatest number of outpatient visits per event (6.8 [SD 6.7] 
visits). All SREs were associated with substantial HRU therefore, preventing 
SREs in patients with breast cancer may reduce the burden imposed on healthcare 
systems.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to count the lifelong rehabilitation costs 
associated with surviving meningococcal disease with major sequelae from the 
perspective of the Spanish National Healthcare System (NHS) and the national 
government.
METHODS: Two severe scenarios describing meningococcal disease were developed, 
one case that represented meningococcal septicaemia and another case for 
meningococcal meningitis. The scenarios were developed based on a literature 
review on severe sequelae of meningococcal disease, and discussions with 
paediatricians who have been responsible for the treatment of children with this 
disease in Spain. Second, a detailed list of all health, educational and social 
care resources used by survivors during their acute illness and during the rest 
of their lives and by family members was obtained by interviewing survivors and 
their families. Professionals in health and social care were also interviewed to 
complete the list of resources and ensure the scenario's were accurate. The 
costs attributed to these resources were obtained from tariff lists, catalogues 
and published information by the national authorities. All costs were based on a 
life expectancy of a survivor of 70 years and expressed in EUR 2012.
RESULTS: In this study it was estimated that the lifelong discounted 
rehabilitation costs associated with the treatment of long-term sequelae due to 
meningococcal disease are approximately €1180,000-€1400,000. Medical care and 
social care were the main cost drivers for both septicaemia and meningitis. 
Annual costs showed to be the largest in the first year after diagnosis of the 
disease for both cases, due to high hospital admission and medical care costs 
during this period and decreased significantly over the years.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the lifelong rehabilitation costs associated 
with the survival of meningococcal disease with severe sequelae place an 
important burden on the NHS budget and governmental resources in Spain.

Vaccines are effective tools to improve human health, but resources to pursue 
all vaccine-related investments are lacking. Benefit-cost and cost-effectiveness 
analysis are the two major methodological approaches used to assess the impact, 
efficiency, and distributional consequences of disease interventions, including 
those related to vaccinations. Childhood vaccinations can have important 
non-health consequences for productivity and economic well-being through 
multiple channels, including school attendance, physical growth, and cognitive 
ability. Benefit-cost analysis would capture such non-health benefits; 
cost-effectiveness analysis does not. Standard cost-effectiveness analysis may 
grossly underestimate the benefits of vaccines. A specific willingness-to-pay 
measure is based on the notion of the value of a statistical life (VSL), derived 
from trade-offs people are willing to make between fatality risk and wealth. 
Such methods have been used widely in the environmental and health literature to 
capture the broader economic benefits of improving health, but reservations 
remain about their acceptability. These reservations remain mainly because the 
methods may reflect ability to pay, and hence be discriminatory against the 
poor. However, willingness-to-pay methods can be made sensitive to income 
distribution by using appropriate income-sensitive distributional weights. Here, 
we describe the pros and cons of these methods and how they compare against 
standard cost-effectiveness analysis using pure health metrics, such as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
in the context of vaccine priorities. We conclude that if appropriately used, 
willingness-to-pay methods will not discriminate against the poor, and they can 
capture important non-health benefits such as financial risk protection, 
productivity gains, and economic wellbeing.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of treatment approach on the outcomes of 
newborns (birth weight [BW] < 1,000 g) with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), from 
the Brazilian Neonatal Research Network (BNRN) on: death, bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia (BPD), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH III/IV), retinopathy of 
prematurity requiring surgical (ROPsur), necrotizing enterocolitis requiring 
surgery (NECsur), and death/BPD.
METHODS: This was a multicentric, cohort study, retrospective data collection, 
including newborns (BW < 1000 g) with gestational age (GA) < 33 weeks and 
echocardiographic diagnosis of PDA, from 16 neonatal units of the BNRN from 
January 1, 2010 to Dec 31, 2011. Newborns who died or were transferred until the 
third day of life, and those with presence of congenital malformation or 
infection were excluded. Groups: G1 - conservative approach (without treatment), 
G2 - pharmacologic (indomethacin or ibuprofen), G3 - surgical ligation 
(independent of previous treatment). Factors analyzed: antenatal corticosteroid, 
cesarean section, BW, GA, 5 min. Apgar score < 4, male gender, Score for 
Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension (SNAPPE II), respiratory distress 
syndrome (RDS), late sepsis (LS), mechanical ventilation (MV), surfactant (< 2 h 
of life), and time of MV.
OUTCOMES: death, O2 dependence at 36 weeks (BPD36wks), IVH III/IV, ROPsur, 
NECsur, and death/BPD36wks.
STATISTICS: Student's t-test, chi-squared test, or Fisher's exact test; Odds 
ratio (95% CI); logistic binary regression and backward stepwise multiple 
regression. Software: MedCalc (Medical Calculator) software, version 12.1.4.0. 
p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: 1,097 newborns were selected and 494 newborns were included: G1 - 187 
(37.8%), G2 - 205 (41.5%), and G3 - 102 (20.6%). The highest mortality was 
observed in G1 (51.3%) and the lowest in G3 (14.7%). The highest frequencies of 
BPD36wks (70.6%) and ROPsur were observed in G3 (23.5%). The lowest occurrence 
of death/BPD36wks occurred in G2 (58.0%). Pharmacological (OR 0.29; 95% CI: 
0.14-0.62) and conservative (OR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.14-0.79) treatments were 
protective for the outcome death/BPD36wks.
CONCLUSION: The conservative approach of PDA was associated to high mortality, 
the surgical approach to the occurrence of BPD36wks and ROPsur, and the 
pharmacological treatment was protective for the outcome death/BPD36wks.

General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients requesting surgical procedures performed for 
brachioplasty and massive weight loss is increasing. The authors set out to 
quantify the health state utility outcome assessment of living with arm 
deformity requiring brachioplasty.
METHODS: Utility assessments using the visual analog scale (VAS), time trade-off 
(TTO), and standard gamble (SG) were used to obtain utilities scores for arm 
deformity, monocular blindness, and binocular blindness from a sample of the 
general population and medical students. Linear regression and Student t test 
were used for statistical analysis. A P value less than 0.05 was deemed 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: All the measures for arm deformity of the 107 volunteers (VAS, 0.80 ± 
0.14; TTO, 0.91 ± 0.12; SG, 0.94 ± 0.10) were significantly different (P < 
0.001) from the corresponding measures for monocular blindness and binocular 
blindness. When compared to the sample of the general population, having a 
medical education demonstrated a statistical significance of being less likely 
to trade years of life and less likely to gamble risk of death for a procedure 
such as a brachioplasty. Race and sex were not statistically significant 
independent predictors of risk acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: We have objectified the health state of living with upper arm 
deformity requiring brachioplasty. Utility outcome scores (VAS, 0.80 ± 0.14; 
TTO, 0.91 ± 0.12; SG, 0.94 ± 0.10) were comparable to living with health states 
such as aging neck needing rejuvenation, excess skin in the thighs necessitating 
thigh lift, and massive weight loss requiring panniculectomy based on previously 
reported studies.

A mutagenized and genetically modified derivative of Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium 14028S, VNP20009 (ATCC 202165), is attenuated in host virulence and 
accumulates preferentially in tumors. Here, we report the complete genome of 
this anticancer therapy agent consisting of one chromosome and one virulence 
plasmid. The major genetic features that distinguish VNP20009 from its parental 
strain are: an engineered msbB deletion, a 3'-extension in pykA, a Tn10-caused 
16.6-kbp inversion leading to the disruption of purM, a 108-kbp Suwwan deletion 
resulting in the loss of 128 genes, and 50 non-synonymous SNPs.

Photodynamic therapy in cholangiocarcinoma: an overview.

Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Rue du Bugnon 46, Lausanne CH 1011, 
Switzerland.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a challenge to manage; mortality rate is nearly as high as 
the incidence. Unless curative resection is performed, these tumours are rapidly 
fatal because they respond poorly to current therapies. Symptoms occur late in 
cholangiocarcinoma and curative resection can be performed in less than half of 
the patients. In non-resectable disease, endoprostheses insertion can relieve 
jaundice and improve quality of life, provided that tumour extension does not 
lead to diffuse intrahepatic stenoses of ductal system. However, tumour growth 
cannot be influenced and therefore, prognosis remains dismal. Despite the fact, 
that radiotherapy and chemotherapy could reduce tumour volume and growth, no 
survival advantage has yet been shown. Photodynamic therapy has been evaluated 
as an new additional, palliative option. A randomised trial comparing 
photodynamic therapy plus endoprostheses insertion versus endoprostheses 
insertion alone, indicates a considerably benefit on survival time, cholestasis 
and quality of life in large, advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Furthermore, few 
specific side effects occurred. Since photodynamic therapy is the first approach 
leading to an improvement of prognosis, it should be offered to patients with 
non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma.

lupus erythematosus.

OBJECTIVE: Data describing relationships between muscle strength, muscle mass, 
and physical disability among individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) are limited. The present study examines the relationship of muscle 
strength and muscle mass with physical disability among adult women with SLE.
METHODS: A total of 146 women from a longitudinal SLE cohort participated in the 
study. All measures were collected during an in-person research visit. Lower 
extremity muscle strength was assessed by peak knee torque of extension and 
flexion and by chair-stand time. Total lean body mass, appendicular lean mass, 
and fat mass (kg/m(2) ) were measured by whole-body dual x-ray absorptiometry. 
Self-reported physical disability was assessed using the Short Form 36 health 
survey (SF-36) physical functioning subscale, and the Valued Life Activities 
(VLA) disability scale. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients tested the 
correlations between muscle strength, muscle mass, and disability scores. 
Regression analyses modeled the effect of lower extremity muscle strength and 
mass on SF-36 and VLA disability scores controlling for age, SLE duration, SLE 
disease activity measured with the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire, 
physical activity level, prednisone use, body composition, and depression.
RESULTS: On all measures, reduced lower extremity muscle strength was associated 
with poorer SF-36 and VLA disability scores. Trends persisted after adjustment 
for covariates. Muscle mass was moderately correlated with muscle strength, but 
did not contribute significantly to adjusted regression models.
CONCLUSION: Lower extremity muscle strength, but not muscle mass, was strongly 
associated with physical disability scores. While further studies are needed, 
these findings suggest that improving muscle strength may reduce physical 
disability among women with SLE.

Hematological Responses, Survival, and Respiratory Exchange in the Olive 
Flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, during Starvation.

Korea .

A 12-wk experiment was conducted to examine the hematological changes, survival, 
and respiratory exchange in the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, during 
starvation. The growth, survival and respiratory exchange rates of the starved 
group were lower than those of the fed group during the experiment. Blood 
analysis, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cells, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular 
volume, did not differ significantly (p>0.05) between the fed and starved groups 
at the end of the experiment. There were no significant differences in plasma 
cortisol, glucose, Na(+), Cl(-), K(+), or aspartate aminotransferase between the 
fed and starved groups (p>0.05). Alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in 
the starved group than in the fed group, whereas plasma osmolality was lower in 
the starved group than in the fed group. It was shown that starved fish had 
various problems after four weeks, which did not occur in the fed group. 
Long-term starvation is infrequent in aquaculture farms. However, starvation 
studies of this kind are very useful for a basic understanding of how 
physiological changes affect fish health, life expectancy, and growth.

We used the Archimedes Model, a mathematical simulation model (Model) to 
estimate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of using LDL particle 
concentration (LDL-P) as an adjunct or alternative to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to 
guide statin therapy. LDL-P by NMR has been shown to be a better measure of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL-C, and may therefore be a better 
gauge of the need for and response to statin treatment. Using the Model, we 
conducted a virtual clinical trial comparing the use of LDL-C alone, LDL-P 
alone, and LDL-C and LDL-P together to guide treatment in the general adult 
population, and in high-risk, dyslipidemic subpopulations. In the general 
population, the 5-year major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) relative risk 
reduction (RRR) of LDL-P alone compared to the control arm (LDL-C alone) was 
5.0% (95% CI, 4.7-5.3; p < .0001); using both LDL-C and LDL-P (dual markers) led 
to 3.0% RRR compared to the control arm (95% CI, 2.8-3.3; p < .0001). For 
individuals with diabetes, the RRR was 7.3% (95% CI, 6.4-8.2; p < .0001) for 
LDL-P alone and 6.9% for dual markers (95% CI, 6.1-7.8; both, p < .0001). In the 
general population, the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated 
with the use of LDL-P alone were $76,052 at 5 years and $8913 at 20 years and 
$142,825 at 5 years and $25,505 at 20 years with the use of both markers. In 
high-risk subpopulations, the use of LDL-P alone was cost-saving at 5 years; 
whereas the cost per QALY for the use of both markers was $14,250 at 5 years and 
$859 at 20 years for high-risk dyslipidemics, $19,192 at 5 years and $649 at 20 
years for diabetics, and $9030 at 5 years and $7268 at 20 years for patients 
with prior CHD. In conclusion, the model estimates that using LDL-P to guide 
statin therapy may reduce the risk of CVD events to a greater extent than does 
the use of LDL-C alone and maybe cost-effective or cost-saving for high-risk 
patients.

We investigate the effects of optimal time and resource allocation on age 
patterns of fertility and mortality for a model organism with (1) fixed maximum 
lifespan, (2) distinct juvenile and adult diets, and (3) reliance on 
nonrenewable resources for reproduction. We ask when it is optimal to tolerate 
starvation vs. conserve resources and then examine the effects of these 
decisions on adult mortality rates. We find that (1) age-related changes in 
tradeoffs partition the life cycle into as many as four discrete phases with 
different optimal behavior and mortality patterns, and (2) given a cost of 
reproduction, terminal investment can produce a signal of actuarial senescence. 
Also, given limitations imposed by non-replenishable resources, individuals 
beginning adult life with more replenishable resources do not necessarily live 
longer, since they can engage in capital breeding and need not defer 
reproduction to forage; low reproductive overheads and low costs of starvation 
also encourage capital breeding and may lead to earlier terminal investment and 
earlier senescence. We conclude that, even for species with qualitatively 
similar life histories, differences in physiological, behavioral and 
environmental tradeoffs or constraints may strongly influence optimal allocation 
schedules and produce variation in mortality patterns and life expectancy.

[Hygienic assessment of the radiation risk of radon emanation in the Altai 
Krai].

[Article in Russian]

Saldan IP, Balandovich BA, Potseluev NY, Flat MKh.

The unique climatic and geographical location of the Altai Krai determines the 
specific radiation dose load for the population, which is composed of the 
complex of radiological indices, the structure of which is largely dependent on 
the type of locality and, to a greater extent due to the action of radon, which 
is currently the main source of internal radiation of the population of upland 
districts and adjacent territories. There was performed a hygienic assessment of 
the radiation risk and the expected decline in life expectancy and population 
health due to radon exposure in the model areas of the Altai Krai. To calculate 
the additional risk there were used some models for radiation risk 
extrapolation: a risk constant model, model GSF (Jacobi's model), Lubin model 
(TSE/AGE/WL) and BEIR VI model for smoking and nonsmoking population, as well as 
the combined model. The lowest values of the radiation risk and the expected 
decline in life expectancy are typical for Charyshsko-Ust-Kalmanskaya zone, the 
maximum--for Kuryinsko--Pospelikhinskaya zone.
