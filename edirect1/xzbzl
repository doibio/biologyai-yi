INTRODUCTION: Stent migration is a significant clinical problem in palliation of 
malignant strictures in the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ). We 
have compared a newer design of a fully-covered stent to a widely used 
semi-covered stent using migration >20 mm as the primary outcome variable. 
Effects on dysphagia, quality of life (QoL) and re-intervention frequency were 
also investigated.
METHODS: Patients with dysphagia due to non-curable esophagus/GEJ cancer were 
randomized to receive either a more recent design of a fully-covered stent (n = 
48) or a conventional semi-covered stent (n = 47). Chest x-ray, dysphagia and 
QoL were studied at baseline, one week, four weeks and three months thereafter.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences either in stent migration 
distance or in the migration frequency. Stent migration during the total study 
period occurred in 37.2 % in the semi-covered group compared to 20.0 % for the 
fully-covered group. Dysphagia was measured with Watson and Ogilvie scores and 
with the dysphagia module in the QoL scale (QLQ-OG25). On average, there was a 
tendency to better dysphagia relief for the fully-covered design as scored with 
the two latter dysphagia instruments (p= 0.081 and p= 0.067) at three months and 
towards more re-interventions in the semi-covered group (p= 0.083).
CONCLUSION: In spite of its somewhat lower intrinsic radial force, the 
fully-covered stent was comparable to the conventional semi-covered stent with 
regard to stent migration. The data further suggest a potential benefit of the 
fully-covered stent in improving dysphagia in patients with longer life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE: Patients with advanced cancer have increased life expectancy but suffer 
from ongoing burden. Depressive symptomatology is their most common mental 
health concern. The Ottawa Palliative Rehabilitation Program (PRP) offers 
rehabilitation for this population. It offers 8 weeks of individualized 
interdisciplinary rehabilitation, post cancer treatment. Interventions include 
medical (physician and nurse), physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietary, and 
social work using a general self-efficacy framework. Pilot data suggest benefits 
in a range of domains, including ratings of feeling "depressed." We examined 
whether reduced symptomatology was maintained 3 months after PRP completion.
METHODS: Participants with advanced heterogeneous cancers who completed the PRP 
were mailed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (among others) 3-month 
post-PRP (n = 44). Demographic and medical information were obtained from 
patient files.
RESULTS: There was a significant linear trend (mean T1: 6.79 ± 2.29; T2: 
5.23 ± 3.06; T3: 4.59 ± 3.34; p = 0.007) with statistically and clinically 
significant decreases in reported depressive symptomatology between T1 and T2 
(p = 0.042) and T1 and T3 (p = 0.007). There was a significant decreases in 
number of cases reporting symptomatology scores in the clinical range from T1 to 
T3 (p = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo a palliative rehabilitation program may 
experience relief of mild depressive symptomatology, maintainable 3-month 
post-PRP. The sample was exhibiting mild symptomatology and these results may 
not be generalizable to those with higher scores; a lack of specialized 
psychosocial clinician may have affected the acquired sample. Experimental 
designs are needed to more thoroughly compare these findings to independent 
rehabilitation interventions.

South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. dr.elizabeth.pathak@gmail.com.

IMPORTANCE: Black men have the lowest life expectancy of all major ethnic-sex 
populations in the USA, yet no recent studies have comprehensively examined 
black male mortality.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze recent mortality trends for 
black men, including black to white (B to W) disparities.
DESIGN: The study design was national mortality surveillance for 2000 to 2014.
SETTING: The setting was the USA.
POPULATION: All black non-Hispanic males aged ≥15 years old in the USA, 
including institutionalized persons, were included.
EXPOSURE: The 15 leading causes of death were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Linear regression of log-transformed annual 
age-adjusted death rates was used to calculate average annual percent change 
(AAPC) in mortality. Black to white (B to W) disparity rate ratios (RR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) were compared for 2000 and 2014. The most recent 
available social and economic profile data were obtained from the U.S. Census of 
Population.
RESULTS: The top five causes of death for black men in 2014, with percentage of 
total deaths, were (1) heart disease (24.8%), (2) cancer (23.0%), (3) 
unintentional injuries (5.8%), (4) stroke (5.1%), and (5) homicide (4.3%). 
Significant mortality declines for 12 of the 15 leading causes occurred through 
2014, with the strongest decline for HIV/AIDS (AAPC -8.0, 95% CI -8.8 to -7.1). 
Only Alzheimer's disease, ranked #15, significantly increased (AAPC +2.5, 95% CI 
+1.4 to +3.7). Significant black disadvantage persisted for 10 of the 15 leading 
causes in 2014, including homicide (RR = 10.43, 95% CI 9.98 to 10.89), HIV/AIDS 
(RR = 8.01, 95% CI 7.50 to 8.54), diabetes (RR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.82 to 1.93), and 
stroke (RR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.65). The B to W disparity did not improve 
for heart disease (RR 1.24 in 2000 vs. RR 1.23 in 2014), but did improve for 
cancer (RR 1.39 in 2000 vs. 1.20 in 2014). Death rates were significantly lower 
in black men for five causes, including unintentional injuries (RR = 0.83, 95% 
CI 0.80 to 0.84), chronic lower respiratory diseases (RR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.73 to 
0.78), and suicide (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.39).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Total mortality significantly declined for black men 
from 2000 to 2014, and the overall B to W disparity narrowed to RR = 1.21 (95% 
CI 1.20 to 1.23) in 2014. However, significant black disadvantages relative to 
white men persisted for 10 leading causes of death.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bronchiectasis is a growing health burden both 
globally and in Australasia. Associated with repeated respiratory infections, 
the disease often results in hospital admission, impaired quality of life, 
reduced lung function and shortened life expectancy. We describe the local 
clinical, physiological and sputum characteristics in patients hospitalized with 
an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
METHODS: This study examined the medical records of all 61 adults admitted to a 
metropolitan Australian hospital with an infective exacerbation of 
bronchiectasis in a calendar year.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics include: mean (SD) age of participants was 66 
(14) years; 56% were women and 42% were current or ex-smokers. The majority had 
other coexisting medical conditions, with asthma in 44%, COPD in 59% and both 
asthma and COPD in 31%. Seventy-two percent were on regular inhaled medication, 
23% on cyclical antibiotics and 26% undertook regular respiratory physiotherapy. 
Bronchodilator reversibility was present in 17% and small airway reversibility 
in 41%. Sputum demonstrated normal flora in 17%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 32%, 
Haemophilus influenzae in 15% and both organisms in 17%. Mean numbers of 
exacerbations per year requiring hospitalization was 2.3. Sixty-two percent of 
subjects had an Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage in deciles 1-5. 
Risk factors for exacerbations included a history of asthma or COPD, documented 
small airway reversibility and presence of P. aeruginosa.
CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized with an infective exacerbation of 
bronchiectasis are predominantly older with co-morbidities and of lower 
socio-economic status. Presence of P. aeruginosa was a risk factor for repeated 
exacerbations, as was a history of asthma, COPD or small airway reversibility.

BACKGROUND: Projections of future mortality and life expectancy are needed to 
plan for health and social services and pensions. Our aim was to forecast 
national age-specific mortality and life expectancy using an approach that takes 
into account the uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model.
METHODS: We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which 
probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We applied this 
approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030 in 35 industrialised 
countries with high-quality vital statistics data. We used age-specific death 
rates to calculate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability 
of dying before age 70 years, with life table methods.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a 
probability of at least 65% for women and 85% for men. There is a 90% 
probability that life expectancy at birth among South Korean women in 2030 will 
be higher than 86·7 years, the same as the highest worldwide life expectancy in 
2012, and a 57% probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected 
female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in France, Spain, and 
Japan. There is a greater than 95% probability that life expectancy at birth 
among men in South Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 
2030, and a greater than 27% probability that it will surpass 85 years. Of the 
countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia have 
some of the lowest projected life expectancy gains for both men and women. The 
female life expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in every 
country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is predicted to increase 
more than male life expectancy, and in Chile, France, and Greece where the two 
sexes will see similar gains. More than half of the projected gains in life 
expectancy at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65 
years.
INTERPRETATION: There is more than a 50% probability that by 2030, national 
female life expectancy will break the 90 year barrier, a level that was deemed 
unattainable by some at the turn of the 21st century. Our projections show 
continued increases in longevity, and the need for careful planning for health 
and social services and pensions.

OBJECTIVE: When a bypass fails, the options are lysis, redo bypass, or 
endovascular intervention. If lysis of the original bypass is not considered an 
option, which is better-redo bypass or attempts at endovascular recanalization 
of the native system? This retrospective study examined the outcomes of native 
superficial femoral artery (SFA) chronic total occlusion (CTO) recanalization 
compared with redo bypass after failed femoropopliteal bypass.
METHODS: Patients presenting with a symptomatic failed femoropopliteal bypass 
that underwent attempted CTO endovascular (EV) recanalization of the native SFA 
or a redo femoropopliteal bypass (BP) from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed. Patients 
undergoing catheter-directed thrombolysis were excluded. Time-dependent outcomes 
were assessed with life-table analyses. Factor analyses were performed using a 
Cox proportional hazard model for time-dependent variables.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (69% male; average age, 65 years) underwent EV 
(n = 40) or BP (n = 64) after presentation with symptomatic occlusion of a 
previous femoropopliteal bypass graft (rest pain in 84% and life-style limiting 
claudication in 16%, 79% to the above-knee popliteal, 81% prosthetic). According 
to the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral 
Arterial Disease classification, 91% of the lesions were category D and 19% were 
category C. Tibial runoff was one tibial vessel in 79% of the patients and two 
or more runoff vessels in the remainder. Lesions treated endovascularly 
underwent primary stenting with a median of 3 stents used. Of the bypasses 
performed, 69% were to the below knee popliteal and remainder were to the 
proximal tibials (68% of the patients had a venous conduit). At 30 days in EV vs 
BP, major adverse cardiovascular events were 3% and 8% (P = .24), major adverse 
limb events were 25% and 11% (P = .01), and the amputation rate was 8% and 8% 
(P = .96), respectively. Amputation-free survival was 33% ± 9% and 56% ± 8% (P = 
.02) and freedom from major adverse limb event was 19% ± 8% and 46% ± 7% (P = 
.04) at 3 years for EV vs BP, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk cohort when thrombolysis is excluded, BP is superior 
to EV after failure of a femoropopliteal bypass.

OBJECTIVE: Early cannulation arteriovenous grafts (ecAVGs) are proposed as an 
alternative to tunneled central venous catheters (TCVCs) in patients requiring 
immediate vascular access for hemodialysis (HD). We compared bacteremia rates in 
patients treated with ecAVG and TCVC.
METHODS: The study randomized 121 adult patients requiring urgent vascular 
access for HD in a 1:1 fashion to receive an ecAVG with or without (+/-) an 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF; n = 60) or TCVC+/-AVF (n = 61). Patients were 
excluded if they had active systemic sepsis, no anatomically suitable vessels, 
or an anticipated life expectancy <3 months. The primary end point was the 
culture-proven bacteremia rate at 6 months, with the trial powered to detect a 
reduction in bacteremia from 24% to 5% (α = .05, β = .8). Secondary end points 
included thrombosis, reintervention, and mortality. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: Culture-proven bacteremia developed in 10 patients (16.4%) in the TCVC 
arm ≤6 months compared with two (3.3%) in the ecAVG+/-AVF arm (risk ratio, 0.2; 
95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.56; P = .02). Mortality was also higher in the 
TCVC+/-AVF cohort (16% [n = 10] vs 5% [n = 3]; risk ratio, 0.3; 95% CI, 
0.08-0.45; P = .04). The difference in treatment cost between the two arms was 
not significant (£11,393 vs £9692; P = .24).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TCVC+/-AVF, a strategy of ecAVG+/-AVF reduced the 
rate of culture-proven bacteremia and mortality in patients requiring urgent 
vascular access for HD. The strategy also proved to be cost-neutral.

Radioiodine therapy for benign and malignant thyroid disease rose at the birth 
of nuclear medicine. Since then, this procedure has been performed countless of 
times in adult and in pediatric patients alike, and has contributed to a 
normalization of life expectancy in all but I-131 refractory differentiated 
thyroid cancer (DTC) cases. As 131I therapy in children is almost exclusively 
given for DTC, this review of radioiodine therapy in children focuses on 
patients with malignant thyroid disease. The aim of the present review is to 
provide an overview of the indications, practical execution, and controversies 
surrounding 131I therapy for malignant tumors in pediatric patients. In 
pediatric patients, special considerations apply for 131I therapy for DTC 
because of differences in biological behavior to adult DTC, differences in 
dosaging caused by patients' lower bodyweight, and differences in the indication 
for 131I therapy because of the inherently good prognosis in most patients and 
potential adverse effects in patients with a long life expectancy. However, if 
applied correctly, 131I therapy in the hands of expert nuclear medicine 
physicians is a highly effective oncologic therapy, which has proven to 
represent an effective and well-tolerated procedure in the management of 
pediatric patients with DTC.

The position, in a pelvis-embedded anatomical coordinate system, of skin points 
located over the following anatomical landmarks (AL) was determined while the 
hip assumed different spatial postures: right and left anterior superior and 
posterior superior iliac spines, and the sacrum. Postures were selected as 
occurring during walking and during a flexion-extension and circumduction 
movement, as used to determine the hip joint centre position (star-arc 
movement). Five volunteers, characterised by a wide range of body mass indices 
(22-37), were investigated. Subject-specific MRI pelvis digital bone models were 
obtained. For each posture, the pose of the pelvis-embedded anatomical 
coordinate system was determined by registering this bone model with points 
digitised over bony prominences of the pelvis, using a wand carrying a 
marker-cluster and stereophotogrammetry. The knowledge of how the position of 
the skin points varies as a function of the hip posture provided information 
regarding the soft tissue artefact (STA) that would affect skin markers located 
over those points during stereophotogrammetric movement analysis. The STA was 
described in terms of amplitude (relative to the position of the AL during an 
orthostatic posture), diameter (distance between the positions of the AL which 
were farthest away from each other), and pelvis orientation. The STA amplitude, 
exhibited, over all postures, a median [inter-quartile] value of 9[6] and 
16[11]mm, for normal and overweight volunteers, respectively. STA diameters were 
larger for the star-arc than for the walking postures, and the direction was 
predominantly upwards. Consequent errors in pelvic orientation were in the range 
1-9 and 4-11 degrees, for the two groups respectively.

assessment. Since the seminal 1977 article by Weinstein and Stason, the 
recommended approach has been the use of the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio based on the metric of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained, 
allowing comparisons across different technologies. An expanded framework, 
incorporating a wider range of the elements of value, is proposed. In addition 
to the core value drivers of health gain and other health system cost savings 
(if any), we propose adding other less recognized elements related to the value 
of knowing and informational externalities. We describe each of five factors 
related to the value of knowing: 1) a reduction in uncertainty, reflecting the 
benefit of a companion diagnostic increasing the certainty of a patient׳s 
response to a medicine; 2) insurance value related to greater peace of mind due 
to protection against catastrophic health and financial loss; 3) the value of 
hope for a "cure," leading individuals to become risk seekers in some 
circumstances; 4) real option value due to life extension opening possibilities 
for individuals to benefit from future innovation; and 5) spillovers or 
externalities arising from benefits of scientific advances that cannot be 
entirely appropriated by those making the advances. Further thought and research 
are needed on how best to measure and integrate these elements into an 
incremental value framework and on coverage and pricing decisions.

BACKGROUND: Many economic evaluations of health care changes rely on 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates. Notably, though, the QALY approach 
values health states rather than changes in health states. Hence, a gain in 
utility of health is only indirectly valued through an ex ante preference 
elicitation of health states and the subsequent subtraction of health state 
values from one another, rather than being valued directly. There is therefore 
an underlying assumption that individuals, from an ex ante perspective ceteris 
paribus, would be indifferent between equal utility increments from health 
states with different baseline utilities.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to develop a method that would allow us to 
measure individual-based preferences over utility increments from different 
baselines. We elicit our data using face-to-face interviews on a sample of UK 
individuals.
RESULTS: Overall, we find that gains of "equal" utility increments from 
different baselines are not found to be equally preferable by the individual.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the subtraction approach could lead to 
sub-optimal resource allocations and suggest that a new approach which values 
health changes directly would better reflect individual preferences. This paper 
provides the foundations for a method to achieve this.

BACKGROUND: The use of budget thresholds is a recent development in the United 
States (e.g., the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review drug assessments). 
Budget thresholds establish limits that require some type of budgetary action if 
exceeded. This research focused on the advisability of using product-level 
budget thresholds as fixed spending caps by examining whether they are likely to 
improve or worsen market efficiency over status quo.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether fixed product-level 
spending caps are advisable for biopharmaceuticals.
METHODS: We systematically examined 5-year, postlaunch revenue for drugs that 
launched in the United States between 2003 and 2014 using the IMS MIDAS 
database. For products launched between 2011 and 2014, we used historical 
revenue as the baseline and trended out 60 months postlaunch based on 
exponential smoothing. Forecasted fifth-year revenue was compared to analyst 
reports. Fifth-year revenue was compared against a hypothetical $904 million 
spending cap to determine the amount of annual spending that might require 
reallocation. Descriptive statistics of 5-year, postlaunch revenue and annual 
spending requiring reallocation were calculated.
RESULTS: Adhering to a $904 million product-level spending cap requires that 
approximately one-third of new drug spending be reallocated to other goods and 
services that have the potential to be less cost-effective due to significant 
barriers.
CONCLUSION: Fixed product-level spending caps have the potential to reduce 
market efficiency due to their independence from value and the presence of 
important operational challenges.

The majority of the current systems spread across the world require the value of 
pharmaceuticals to be demonstrated with an acceptable degree of certainty before 
a technology is funded. Often involving the notion of cost-effectiveness, one of 
the key characteristics of such assessments tends to be the consideration of 
efficiency as a static outcome; with a strong emphasis on current health gains 
but a disregard for the impact of decision making on the potential health value 
over time. In this article, we argue that current systems using 
cost-effectiveness thresholds may provide an incomplete indicator of value. We 
defend the idea that funding decisions should also be informed by dynamic 
efficiency considerations and reflect both the current and the future value of 
achieving a certain level of effectiveness in a specific disease area. We 
further lay down the foundations for the implementation of such a value 
assessment framework.

INTRODUCTION: Primary endocrine therapy (PET) is used variably in the UK as an 
alternative to surgery for older women with operable breast cancer. Guidelines 
state that only patients with "significant comorbidity" or "reduced life 
expectancy" should be treated this way and age should not be a factor.
METHODS: A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was used to determine the impact of 
key variables (patient age, comorbidity, cognition, functional status, cancer 
stage, cancer biology) on healthcare professionals' (HCP) treatment preferences 
for operable breast cancer among older women. Multinomial logistic regression 
was used to identify associations.
RESULTS: 40% (258/641) of questionnaires were returned. Five variables (age, 
co-morbidity, cognition, functional status and cancer size) independently 
demonstrated a significant association with treatment preference (p < 0.05). 
Functional status was omitted from the multivariable model due to collinearity, 
with all other variables correlating with a preference for operative treatment 
over no preference (p < 0.05). Only co-morbidity, cognition and cancer size 
correlated with a preference for PET over no preference (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The majority of respondents selected treatment in accordance with 
current guidelines, however in some scenarios, opinion was divided, and age did 
appear to be an independent factor that HCPs considered when making a treatment 
decision in this population.

The impact of healthcare spending on health outcomes: A meta-regression 
analysis.

While numerous studies assess the impact of healthcare spending on health 
outcomes, typically reporting multiple estimates of the elasticity of health 
outcomes (most often measured by a mortality rate or life expectancy) with 
respect to healthcare spending, the extent to which study attributes influence 
these elasticity estimates is unclear. Accordingly, we utilize a meta-data set 
(consisting of 65 studies completed over the 1969-2014 period) to examine these 
elasticity estimates using meta-regression analysis (MRA). Correcting for a 
number of issues, including publication selection bias, healthcare spending is 
found to have the greatest impact on the mortality rate compared to life 
expectancy. Indeed, conditional on several features of the literature, the 
spending elasticity for mortality is near -0.13, whereas it is near to +0.04 for 
life expectancy. MRA results reveal that the spending elasticity for the 
mortality rate is particularly sensitive to data aggregation, the specification 
of the health production function, and the nature of healthcare spending. The 
spending elasticity for life expectancy is particularly sensitive to the age at 
which life expectancy is measured, as well as the decision to control for the 
endogeneity of spending in the health production function. With such results in 
hand, we have a better understanding of how modeling choices influence results 
reported in this literature.

BACKGROUND: The uptake of bariatric surgery in Australia has been hampered by 
the lack of funding and lack of evidence on relative value for money.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of adjustable gastric banding 
(AGB), Roux-En-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) versus usual 
care (UC).
SETTING: Perspective of the Australian public healthcare system.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the costs and outcomes for 4 
approaches to managing obesity. The base-case was a 30-year-old Australian 
female with a body-mass index>35. Subgroup analysis was conducted to account for 
the effect of diabetes as well as various differences in cohort characteristics. 
Uncertainty was characterised by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: All bariatric surgeries were effective. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were similar at $24,454 for AGB, $22,645 for RYGB, and 
$27,523 for SG, compared with UC. At a willingness to pay threshold of $70,000 
per quality-adjusted life year, the probabilities of being cost-effective were 
64%, 75%, and 71% for AGB, RYGB, and SG, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed 
that bariatric procedures are less cost-effective for older cohorts. For those 
with diabetes, all the procedures were dominant in comparison with UC.
CONCLUSION: This model shows that all bariatric procedures are a cost-effective 
treatment for the management of obese patients. When given to a subgroup with 
diabetes, bariatric interventions become cost-saving.

BACKGROUND: Several studies and meta-analyses have shown that mortality in 
people with schizophrenia is higher than that in the general population but have 
used relative measures, such as standardised mortality ratios. We did a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate years of potential life lost and 
life expectancy in schizophrenia, which are more direct, absolute measures of 
increased mortality.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science for 
published studies on years of potential life lost and life expectancy in 
schizophrenia. Data from individual studies were combined in meta-analyses as 
weighted averages. We did subgroup analyses for sex, geographical region, timing 
of publication, and risk of bias (estimated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale).
FINDINGS: We identified 11 studies in 13 publications covering all inhabited 
continents except South America (Africa n=1, Asia n=1, Australia n=1, Europe 
n=7, and North America n=3) that involved up to 247 603 patients. Schizophrenia 
was associated with a weighted average of 14·5 years of potential life lost (95% 
CI 11·2-17·8), and was higher for men than women (15·9, 13·8-18·0 vs 13·6, 
11·4-15·8). Loss was least in the Asian study and greatest in Africa. The 
overall weighted average life expectancy was 64·7 years (95% CI 61·1-71·3), and 
was lower for men than women (59·9 years, 95% CI 55·5-64·3 vs 67·6 years, 
63·1-72·1). Life expectancy was lowest in Asia and Africa. Timing of publication 
and risk of bias had little effect on results.
INTERPRETATION: The effects of schizophrenia on years potential life lost and 
life expectancy seem to be substantial and not to have lessened over time. 
Development and implementation of interventions and initiatives to reduce this 
mortality gap are urgently needed.
FUNDING: None.

AIM: Capecitabine and bevacizumab (CAP-B) maintenance therapy has shown to be 
more effective compared with observation in metastatic colorectal 
cancer patients achieving stable disease or better after six cycles of 
first-line capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab treatment in terms of 
progression-free survival. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CAP-B 
maintenance treatment.
METHODS: Decision analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of CAP-B maintenance compared with observation was performed 
based on CAIRO3 study results (n = 558). An additional analysis was performed in 
patients with complete or partial response. The primary outcomes were the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) defined as the additional cost per 
life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, calculated from 
EQ-5D questionnaires and literature and LYs gained. Univariable sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess the influence of input parameters on the ICER, 
and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis represents uncertainty in model 
parameters.
RESULTS: CAP-B maintenance compared with observation resulted in 0.21 QALYs 
(0.18LYs) gained at a mean cost increase of €36,845, yielding an ICER of 
€175,452 per QALY (€204,694 per LY). Varying the difference in health-related 
quality of life between CAP-B maintenance and observation influenced the ICER 
most. For patients achieving complete or partial response on capecitabine, 
oxaliplatin, bevacizumab induction treatment, an ICER of €149,300 per QALY was 
calculated.
CONCLUSION: CAP-B maintenance results in improved health outcomes measured in 
QALYs and LYs compared with observation, but also in a relevant increase in 
costs. Despite the fact that there is no consensus on cost-effectiveness 
thresholds in cancer treatment, CAP-B maintenance may not be considered 
cost-effective.

The "very old intensive care patients" (abbreviated to VOPs; greater than 
80 years old) are probably the fastest expanding subgroup of all intensive care 
unit (ICU) patients. Up until recently most ICU physicians have been reluctant 
to admit these VOPs. The general consensus was that there was little survival to 
gain and the incremental life expectancy of ICU admission was considered too 
small. Several publications have questioned this belief, but others have 
confirmed the poor long-term mortality rates in VOPs. More appropriate triage 
(resource limitation enforced decisions), admission decisions based on shared 
decision-making and improved prediction models are also needed for this 
particular patient group. Here, an expert panel proposes a research agenda for 
VOPs for the coming years.
