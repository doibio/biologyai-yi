OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, prevalence, and demographic factors of 
all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients diagnosed in South Korea from 
2011 to 2015, and to analyze cases misdiagnosed as myelopathy.
METHODS: The whole population registered under the Korean National Health 
Insurance Service (KNHIS) was applied. All 4551 patients who were registered as 
having ALS code from 2011 to 2015 were included. For all ALS patients, the 
incidence, prevalence, and demographic factors were assessed. Trends of 
diagnosis for myelopathy, and surgery prior to confirmation of ALS diagnosis 
were identified.
RESULTS: When the whole 48,135,715 KNHIS population enrolled in 2015, the 
incidence of ALS in 2015 was estimated to be 1.68 per 100,000 person-years, and 
the prevalence was 6.49 per 100,000 persons. Life expectancy of ALS can be 
calculated as 3.9 years after the diagnosis, and the mean age of diagnosis was 
59.5 ± 13.1. A total of 1902 patients diagnosed with myelopathy before a 
diagnosis of ALS accounted for 0.13% of all myelopathy patients, and 41.8% of 
all ALS patients. It took an average of 471.7 d to confirm a diagnosis of ALS 
after the myelopathy diagnosis. Among the patients finally diagnosed with ALS, 
more patients underwent surgery for myelopathy (n = 263, 13.8%) than among 
patients who were diagnosed with myelopathy alone, and underwent surgery 
(n = 141,148, 9.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: This whole-population nationwide demographic study confirmed the 
data from previous studies. Clinicians should consider the possibility of ALS 
when making a myelopathy diagnosis, especially if the symptoms are sufficiently 
severe to require surgery.

A review and validation of overall survival extrapolation in health technology 
assessments of cancer immunotherapy by the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence: how did the initial best estimate compare to trial data 
subsequently made available?

BACKGROUND: Validation of overall survival (OS) extrapolations of 
immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) Single Technology Assessment (STA) process is limited due 
to data still maturing at the time of submission. Inaccurate extrapolation may 
lead to inappropriate decision-making. The availability of more mature trial 
data facilitates a retrospective analysis of the plausibility and validity of 
initial extrapolations. This study compares these extrapolations to subsequently 
available longer-term data.
METHODS: A systematic search of completed NICE appraisals of ICIs from March 
2000 to December 2017 was performed. A targeted search was also undertaken to 
procure published OS data from the pivotal clinical trials for each identified 
STA made available post-submission to NICE. Initial Kaplan-Meier curves and 
associated extrapolations from NICE documentation were extracted to compare the 
accuracy of OS projections versus the most mature data.
RESULTS: The review identified 11 STAs, of which 10 provided OS data upon 
submission to NICE. The extrapolations undertaken considered parametric or 
piecewise survival models. Additional data cut-offs provided a mean of 18 months 
of OS beyond the end of the original data. Initial extrapolations typically 
under-estimated OS from the most mature data cut-off by 0.4-2.7%, depending on 
the choice of assessment method and use of the manufacturer- or ERG-preferred 
extrapolation.
CONCLUSION: Long-term extrapolation of OS is required for NICE STAs based on 
initial immature OS data. The results of this study demonstrate that the initial 
OS extrapolations employed by manufacturers and ERGs generally predicted OS 
reasonably well when compared to more mature data (when available), although on 
average they appeared to underestimate OS. This review and validation shows 
that, while the choice of OS extrapolation is uncertain, the methods adopted are 
generally aligned with later-published follow-up data and appear appropriate for 
informing HTA decisions.

The extended life expectancy questions the quality of life of these additional 
years: with or without disability ? A review of the literature gives us some 
tips on preventive measures to maintain good health at an advanced age. Engaging 
in regular and moderate physical activity (such as walking) offers a range of 
health benefits, including reduced risk of all-cause mortality, lower risk for 
various diseases (ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, breast and 
colon cancer), prevention of falls and functional decline in seniors living at 
home. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle (non-smoking, low alcohol consumption, 
adequate nutrition) as well as up-to-date immunization status and vitamin D 
supplementation in the deficient or vulnerable population, are factors that 
contribute to a better health in the last years of life.

Publisher: L’allongement de l’espérance de vie interroge sur la qualité de vie 
de ces années supplémentaires : avec ou sans handicap ? Une revue de la 
littérature nous apporte quelques réponses sur les mesures de prévention pour 
préserver un bon état de santé à un âge avancé. La pratique d’une activité 
physique modérée comme la marche amène des avantages reconnus : diminution de la 
mortalité, prévention des chutes et du déclin fonctionnel pour le senior vivant 
à domicile, diminution de la survenue de plusieurs maladies (accident vasculaire 
cérébral, maladie coronarienne, diabète) et de plusieurs cancers. Le maintien 
d’un style de vie sain (alimentation équilibrée, absence de tabac, consommation 
modérée d’alcool) ainsi qu’un statut vaccinal à jour et la substitution de la 
carence en vitamine D chez le sujet carencé ou fragile, sont autant d’éléments 
garantissant une meilleure santé dans les dernières années de vie.

Congenital heart disease is an abnormal formation of the heart or blood vessels 
next to the heart. It has an incidence of 8 cases of every 1000 live birth 
worldwide. In the United States, congenital heart disease affects 1% of births 
(40,000) per year, of which 25% have critical Congenital heart disease. In the 
U.S. the congenital heart disease represents approximately 4.5% of all neonatal 
deaths. The survival rate of patients with congenital heart disease will depend 
on the severity, time of diagnosis, and treatment. Approximately 97% of babies 
born with a non-critical congenital heart disease have a life expectancy of one 
year of age, and approximately 95% are expected to live around 18 years of age. 
A rare type of congenital heart disease is an interrupted aortic arch (IAA), 
which affects approximately 1.5% of congenital heart disease 
patients. Interrupted aortic arch is an anomaly that can be considered the most 
severe form of aortic coarctation. In an IAA, there is an anatomical and luminal 
disruption between the ascending and descending aorta. IAA is a ductus dependent 
lesion since this is the only way the blood flow can travel to places distal to 
the disruption. There is posterior malalignment of the conal septum additional 
to the interrupted aortic arch, producing a ventricular septal defect as an 
associated lesion. This lesion is present is approximately 73% of all cases. Due 
to this malalignment, there could be left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 
Besides a ventricular septal defect, IAA can be associated with other more 
complicated cardiac anomalies; for example, transposition of the great arteries, 
truncus arteriosus, aortopulmonary window, single ventricle, aortic valve 
atresia, right-sided ductus, and double-outlet right ventricle.

With average life expectancy and the rising prevalence of obesity, 
osteoarthritis (OA) is creating an increasingly large financial and physical 
burden on the U.S. population today. As the body ages and experiences trauma, 
articular cartilage surfaces in joints are gradually worn away, leading to OA. 
Traditionally, treatment options have included lifestyle modifications, pain 
management, and corticosteroid injections, with joint replacement reserved for 
those who have exhausted nonsurgical measures. More recently, hyaluronic acid, 
micronized dehydrated human amniotic/chorionic membrane tissue, and 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have started to gain traction. PRP has 
been shown to have both anti-inflammatory effects through growth factors such as 
transforming growth factor-β and insulin-like growth factor 1, and stimulatory 
effects on mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. Multiple studies have 
indicated that PRP is superior to hyaluronic acid and corticosteroids in terms 
of improving patient-reported pain and functionality scores. Unfortunately, 
there are many variations in PRP preparation, and lack of standardization in 
factors, such as speed and duration of centrifugation, leads to wide ranges of 
platelet and leukocyte concentrations. This review examines the current 
literature addressing the use of PRP in symptomatic knee OA and addresses 
suggestions for future studies in this area.

Aims: To study the age and sex-dependent mortality rates and causes of death in 
a large Romanian diabetes cohort as compared with the general population. 
Methods: All adult patients aged 20-64 years, receiving a free diabetes 
prescription in a major urban area during 2001-2008 were included and 
followed-up for death until December 31, 2011. Crude mortality rates and 
standardized mortality rate ratios (SMR) against general population (data from 
the National Institute of Statistics) were calculated. Years lost due to 
diabetes were computed assuming the general population mortality rates for ages 
below 20 and above 64 years. Results: During the 11 years study period, 49,328 
diabetes patients (mean age at baseline 53.0 ± 8.8 years) contributed 297,370 
person-years and 5,053 deaths. All cause mortality rates (per 1000 person years) 
increased with age and was 3.4 in 20-24 years age group and 25.7 in 60-64 year 
age group, while the corresponding SMR decreased from 6.0 to 1.5. Diabetes 
patients aged 20-24 years had a life expectancy of 48.6 years, which was 
6.6 years less compared with the corresponding general population (55.2 years). 
The gap was 7.0 years in women and 5.8 years in men. Diabetes patients aged 
20-24 years lost 196 minutes of life daily due to diabetes in women and 
182 minutes in men. Conclusions: Mortality rates increased, while mortality rate 
ratios against general population decreased with age. Men had higher mortality 
rates, but women had higher mortality rate ratios in the gender analysis.

PURPOSE: The management of malignant brain metastases becomes a main issue for 
the treatment of patients, because of the survival extension related to the 
improvement in systemic treatments. Robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (RSR) is a 
new approach in this indication. The purpose of this analysis was to define the 
efficacy of RSR, in order to determine prognostic factors of survival and 
factors of response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: It was a retrospective, single center (polyclinique de 
Bordeaux Nord Aquitaine) analysis performed from 2012 to 2015, involving 
patients with malignant brain metastases treated by RSR using the Cyberknife® 
technique. We analyzed the following parameters: response to RSR, prognostic and 
predictive factors of response, and survival.
RESULTS: A total of 72 RSRs were performed among 55 analyzed patients; 62 
treatments were assessable with a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The main 
delivered dose on the 80%-isodose was 20Gy. A complete response was achieved in 
40.3% of patients (stability or regression=83.9%). The overall survival was 13 
months. The risk of failure was significantly correlated with the increase in 
metastasis size and non-adenocarcinoma histology. A performance status<2 was the 
main prognostic factor of survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The RSR allowed treating 3 to 5 brain metastases, avoiding an 
entire brain irradiation, and maintaining survival and quality of life.

CONTEXT: Healthcare clinicians often endure stress over long periods of time. 
The burden of witnessing death and disability, complex work duties, long and 
irregular hours, the threat of errors, and tensions between colleagues result in 
emotional strain, anxiety, depression, burnout and in the worst case: suicide. 
The Caregiver Support Team was designed to provide emotional first aid to 
clinicians in the healthcare environment in the moment of need and triage those 
who would benefit from ongoing care.
OBJECTIVE/INTERVENTION: To test the feasibility of providing a Caregiver Support 
Team to provide emotional first aid in the workplace. This project is an 
extension of our previously reported Code Lavender initiative.
HYPOTHESES: After stressful events in the workplace, staff will provide, 
receive, and recommend the Caregiver Support Team to others. The Caregiver 
Support Team will be used and accepted by clinicians, improve Professional 
Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL) scores, general job satisfaction and feeling 
cared for in the workplace.
METHOD/SAMPLE: We describe a pilot program. Following the completion of a Code 
Lavender pilot, physicians and staff on 4 hospital units provided nominations 
for peer supporters: someone they would trust in a time of emotional need. These 
peer supporters were provided 8 hours of training by a psychologist and 
voluntarily sought to find those in the workplace who were affected by workplace 
stress and provide emotional support. Feasibility data and ProQoL scores were 
collected at baseline and 3 months.
RESULTS: At baseline, 59% (n = 44) reported symptomatic stress caused by the 
workplace. Main causes of stress were emotional responses of patients/families, 
disputes with colleagues, and negative clinical outcomes. Colleagues were 
reported as the most frequently used source of support following workplace 
stress. A Caregiver Support Team intervention was received by 40% of 
respondents; 100% found it helpful and 100% would recommend it to others. No 
significant changes were demonstrated before and after the intervention in 
ProQoL Scores, or job satisfaction. The emotion of feeling cared-for improved. 
Staff spontaneously requested emotional debriefings through peer supporters. One 
suicide was prevented.
CONCLUSIONS: The Caregiver Support Team was positively received. The 
organization received budgetary support from our hospital to disseminate the 
program system-wide. Additional interventions are needed to overcome the root 
cause of workplace stressors. A formal link between Risk Management is being 
developed to identify cases which warrant emotional (vs. clinical only or both) 
debriefing/group processing.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of 
tofacitinib in Chinese patients with RA enrolled in Phase 3 and long-term 
extension (LTE) studies.
METHODS: ORAL Sync was a 1-year, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial. 
Patients received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo advanced 
to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID at 3 or 6 months. All patients remained on ≥1 
background conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. ORAL 
Sequel is an open-label LTE study (data-cut: March 2015; data collection and 
analyses were ongoing, and study database was not locked at the time of 
analysis; study was closed in 2017). Efficacy outcomes: American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response rates and Disease Activity Score in 28 
joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-4 [ESR]). Patient- and 
physician-reported outcomes: Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index 
(HAQ-DI), Patient and Physician Global Assessment of Arthritis, and pain (visual 
analog scale). Safety was assessed throughout.
RESULTS: ORAL Sync included 218 patients; 192 were subsequently enrolled into 
ORAL Sequel. In ORAL Sync, more patients achieved ACR20 (tofacitinib 5 mg BID, 
67.4%; 10 mg BID, 70.6%; placebo, 34.1%) and DAS28-4 (ESR) <2.6 (tofacitinib 5 
mg BID, 7.1%; 10 mg BID, 13.1%; placebo, 2.3%) with tofacitinib versus placebo 
at Month 6. Mean changes from baseline in HAQ-DI were greater with tofacitinib 
versus placebo at Month 6. In ORAL Sequel, efficacy was consistent to Month 48. 
Incidence rates for adverse events of special interest in tofacitinib-treated 
patients were similar to the global population.
CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib significantly reduced signs/symptoms and improved 
physical function and quality of life in Chinese patients with 
moderate-to-severely active RA up to Month 48. The safety profile was consistent 
with the global population.

Introduction: There are regional differences in the morbidity of major 
cardiovascular disease between the 16 federal states of Germany. An association 
between the morbidity and the health care supply has been described in 
international studies. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the 
relationship between the prevalence or mortality of major cardiovascular disease 
and several key indicators of health care supply in Germany. Methods: Life 
expectancy and the proportion of over 65-year old persons were included as 
characteristics to depict the general health. Indicators of health care supply 
were the number of general practitioners, internists, and cardiologists, number 
of internal medicine and cardiology beds, chest pain units (CPU), cardiac 
catheterization laboratories (CCL) and stroke units. In the form of an 
ecological analysis, we compared the cardiovascular disease prevalence and 
mortality with these indicators and performed a weighted linear regression. 
Results: Regional variations between the federal states were found in general 
health and health care supply. The regression analysis yielded significant 
associations of the prevalence of major cardiovascular disease with the number 
of internal medicine hospital beds (β = 10.042, p = 0.045), cardiologists (β = 
-0.689, p = 0.031), and the number of residents per chest pain unit (β = 42,730, 
p = 0.036). Additionally, the relationship between cardiovascular mortality and 
also the number of residents per chest pain unit appeared to be significant (β = 
4,962, p = 0.002). For all other indicators, no significant association was 
observed. Conclusions: We detected regional differences in the general health 
and health care supply between the 16 German federal states as well as several 
significant associations between cardiovascular morbidity and health care supply 
indicators. Especially the decreasing number of cardiologists and rising number 
of residents per chest pain unit with an increasing prevalence of major 
cardiovascular disease should lead to a discussion about the structure of the 
Germany health care system, such as the needs-based planning mechanism of 
physicians. The results of this study may also aid in future development of 
other health care systems.

Chondrosphere (Spherox) is a form of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). 
It is licensed for repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the 
femoral condyle and the patella of the knee with defect sizes up to 10 cm2 in 
adults. In a single technology appraisal (STA) [TA508] undertaken by the 
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Warwick Evidence was 
the Evidence Review Group (ERG) invited to independently review the evidence 
submitted by the manufacturer, Co.Don. The clinical effectiveness data came from 
their COWISI randomised controlled trial (RCT), which compared Chondrosphere 
with microfracture (MF). The timing of this appraisal was unfortunate given that 
MF was no longer the most relevant comparator because NICE had contemporaneously 
published guidance approving ACI in place of MF. Moreover, the COWISI RCT 
enrolled mostly patients with small defect sizes. Evidence of clinical 
effectiveness for Chondrosphere used in people with larger defect size came from 
another RCT, which compared three doses of Chondrosphere and that by design 
could not provide evidence comparing Chondrosphere to any other forms of ACI. To 
estimate the relative clinical performance of Chondrosphere versus other ACI, 
Co.Don conducted an indirect treatment comparison by network meta-analyses 
(NMA). The NMA was flawed in that the distribution of population characteristics 
that are effect modifiers greatly differed across the treatment comparisons of 
the network. The ERG questioned both the appropriateness of the NMA and the 
validity of the resulting estimates. Co.Don estimated the cost-effectiveness of 
Chondrosphere using a lifetime Markov model with all patients receiving the 
first repair during the first cycle of the model then moving into one of three 
health states: success, no further repair (NFR), or a second repair, if 
necessary. Subsequent to the first cycle, those who were a success either 
remained a success or moved to second repair. All those in NFR remained in NFR. 
The cost-effectiveness of Chondrosphere compared to other ACI forms relied on 
the clinical effectiveness estimates of success and failure rates obtained from 
the company's indirect comparisons, the validity of which the ERG questioned. 
The company revised cost-effectiveness estimates for Chondrosphere versus MF and 
for Chondrosphere versus matrix-applied characterised autologous cultured 
chondrocyte implant (MACI) were £4360 and around £18,000 per quality-adjusted 
life year gained, respectively. NICE recommended ACI using Chondrosphere for 
treating symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and 
patella of the knee in adults only if certain requirements were met.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Teva, the 
company manufacturing arsenic trioxide (ATO; tradename Trisenox®), to submit 
evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of ATO for untreated and 
relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Kleijnen Systematic 
Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, 
was commissioned as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper 
presents a summary of the company submission (CS), the ERG's critical review of 
the clinical and cost effectiveness evidence in the CS, key methodological 
considerations and the development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal 
Committee (AC). The CS presented three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two 
of these were trials in newly diagnosed APL (APL0406 and AML17) and the third 
trial was in patients with relapsed APL. Results from APL0406 showed that more 
people having AATO [ATO plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)] were alive at 50 
months compared with people having AIDA (ATRA in combination with idarubicin) 
(99% vs. 93%; p = 0.007). There was also a statistically significant lower 
cumulative incidence of relapse with AATO compared with AIDA at 50 months (2% 
vs. 14%; p = 0.001). At 4 years, results from AML17 showed a significant 
difference in event-free survival (91% vs. 70%; p = 0.002) favouring AATO but 
not in overall survival (93% vs. 89%; p = 0.250). The only trial presented for 
relapsed/refractory patients compared AATO with ATO, which was not a relevant 
comparison according to the NICE scope. The AC concluded that AATO was effective 
for untreated APL while for relapsed or refractory APL the effectiveness of ATO 
was considered uncertain and the long-term safety remains unexplored. In the CS 
base-case, AATO was less expensive (£31,088 saved) and more effective (2.546 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained) than AIDA and thus the dominating 
strategy for newly diagnosed low- to intermediate-risk APL. However, the ERG's 
critical assessment highlighted a number of concerns, including deviations from 
the NICE reference case and a lack of detailed description and justification of 
parameters and assumptions related to (the extrapolation of) treatment 
effectiveness. However, it was reassuring that AATO for untreated APL remained 
dominant in the ERG base-case, and that the worst-case scenario produced by the 
ERG resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £21,622. The 
AC concluded that although there was uncertainty in the model, it could 
recommend ATO for both untreated and relapsed or refractory APL.

Purpose: Children's resiliency is seen as important in pediatric rehabilitation, 
but is seldom the focus of research or intervention. This article presents a 
resiliency framework to inform pediatric rehabilitation research, service 
design, and practice.Methods: The development of the framework was guided by a 
transactional, life course perspective, and a review of self-constructs in the 
resiliency literature.Results: The framework comprises health-related 
adversities, self-capacities, self-regulatory processes, and adaptive benefits. 
Four adaptive self-capacities are highlighted (activity self-efficacy, capacity 
to marshal resources and supports to achieve goals, capacity to adapt to 
changing life situations, and capacity to envision a positive future). These 
self-capacities are linked to common adversities experienced by children with 
disabilities, namely activity limitations, functioning and participation 
restrictions, transition issues, and anticipated future life challenges. The 
self-capacities are also associated with empowered, optimistic, adaptive, and 
hopeful mindsets, which influence accommodative and assimilative self-regulatory 
strategies affecting children's adaptive benefits.Conclusions: The framework can 
inform resiliency-related research exploring self-capacities and resiliency 
processes. The framework points to what is modifiable through intervention 
targeting the person-in-context, namely self-capacities, mindsets, and situated 
experiences. Implications for service design and delivery include providing 
opportunities and interacting with clients in ways that support the development 
of these self-capacities.Implications for rehabilitationFostering resiliency 
means preparing children with disabilities to negotiate and navigate the 
adversities and challenges they will encounter over their lives.Important 
resiliency-related self-capacities include activity self-efficacy, capacity to 
marshal resources and supports to achieve goals, capacity to adapt to changing 
life situations, and capacity to envision a positive future.The resiliency 
framework suggests the importance of enhancing children's views of themselves as 
empowered, optimistic, adaptive, and hopeful.Practice will be enriched by 
acknowledging that a range of health concerns are relevant to practice, 
including issues of impairment, functioning, participation, and adaptation.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of donepezil and 
rivastigmine therapy for mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the 
perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System.
METHOD: A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 individuals of both sexes, aged >65 
years, and diagnosed with AD was simulated using a Markov model. The time 
horizon was 10 years, with 1-year cycles. A deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: For mild AD, the study showed an increase in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) of 0.61 QALY/21,907.38 Brazilian reais (BRL) for patients treated 
with donepezil and 0.58 QALY/BRL 24,683.33 for patients treated with 
rivastigmine. In the moderate AD group, QALY increases of 0.05/BRL 27,414.96 
were observed for patients treated with donepezil and 0.06/BRL 34,222.96 for 
patients treated with rivastigmine.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study contradict the standard of care for mild 
and moderate AD in Brazil, which is based on rivastigmine. A pharmacological 
treatment option based on current Brazilian clinical practice guidelines for AD 
suggests that rivastigmine is less cost-effective (0.39 QALY/BRL 32,685.77) than 
donepezil. Probabilistic analysis indicates that donepezil is the most 
cost-effective treatment for mild and moderate AD.

The gold rush in the Amazon Region caused an increase of mercury (Hg) levels in 
the environment, and, consequently, raised human exposure. Once released into 
aquatic systems, Hg could generate methylmercury (MeHg), an extremely toxic 
compound, which is accumulated through trophic chains. Several studies have 
provided evidences of the brain sensitivity to MeHg, as well as, of the fetus 
vulnerability during pregnancy. The main objective of this study was to estimate 
the Mild Mental Retardation (MMR) in Amazonian populations, caused by prenatal 
exposure to MeHg, using the methodology proposed by Poulin (2008), which 
quantifies the environmental burden of disease. The estimates of the MMR burden, 
attributed to prenatal MeHg exposure, were based on the calculation of 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), which were obtained from MMR incidence 
rate in the studied populations. At the local level, the MMR incidence rate 
calculations were based on primary data of MeHg exposure of riverine women at 
childbearing age. The MMR incidence rate was equal to 5.96/1,000 infants, which 
would result in 2.0 IQ points loss in 34.31% of the newborns. The estimated 
DALY/1,000 infants was equal to 71.2, while the DALY was 576. For the regional 
estimates, different exposure scenarios were created. The calculated DALY varied 
from 3,256 to 65,952 per year.

Protein transmembrane domains (TMDs) are generally hydrophobic, but our 
bioinformatics analysis shows that many TMDs contain basic residues at terminal 
regions. Physiological functions of these membrane-snorkeling basic residues are 
largely unclear. Here, we show that a membrane-snorkeling Lys residue in 
integrin αLβ2 (also known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 [LFA-1]) 
regulates transmembrane heterodimer formation and integrin adhesion through 
ionic interplay with acidic phospholipids and calcium ions (Ca2+) in T cells. 
The amino group of the conserved Lys ionically interacts with the phosphate 
group of acidic phospholipids to stabilize αLβ2 transmembrane association, thus 
keeping the integrin at low-affinity conformation. Intracellular Ca2+ uses its 
charge to directly disrupt this ionic interaction, leading to the transmembrane 
separation and the subsequent extracellular domain extension to increase 
adhesion activity. This Ca2+-mediated regulation is independent on the canonical 
Ca2+ signaling or integrin inside-out signaling. Our work therefore showcases 
the importance of intramembrane ionic protein-lipid interaction and provides a 
new mechanism of integrin activation.

Although Hong Kong is one of the richest cities in the world and has some of the 
best health outcomes such as long life expectancy, little is known about the 
people who are unable to access healthcare due to lack of financial means. 
Cross-sectional data from a sample of 2,233 participants aged 18 or above was 
collected from the first wave of the "Trends and Implications of Poverty and 
Social Disadvantages in Hong Kong" survey. Socio-demographic factors, lifestyle 
factors, and physical and mental health conditions associated with people who 
were unable to seek medical services due to lack of financial means in the past 
year were examined using forward stepwise logistic regression analyses. Of the 
2,233 participants surveyed, 8.4% did not seek medical care due to lack of 
financial means during the past year. They were more likely to be income-poor. 
With respect to physical and mental health, despite having less likelihood to 
have multimorbidity, they tended to have higher levels of both anxiety and 
stress, poorer physical and mental health-related quality of life, and suffer 
from more severe disability and pain symptoms affecting their daily activities, 
when compared to the rest of the Hong Kong population. People who were denied of 
medical care due to financial barriers are generally sicker than people in the 
general Hong Kong population, implying that those with greater healthcare needs 
may have financial difficulties in receiving timely and appropriate medical 
care. Our findings suggest that inequity in healthcare utilization remains a 
critical issue in Hong Kong.

Population-level mortality benefits of improved blood pressure control in 
Indonesia: a modelling study.

Sudharsanan N(1).

School of Public Health, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.

BACKGROUND: There are few estimates of the potential gains in adult mortality 
from population-level improvements in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in a major 
low-and-middle income country (LMIC). Using nationally representative cohort 
data from Indonesia-the third most populous LMIC- I estimated the gains in adult 
life expectancy from improving SBP control among adults ages 40 and above and 
assessed the benefits among richer and poorer subpopulations.
METHODS: I used longitudinal data from 10 085 adults ages 40 and above (75 288 
person-age observations) enrolled in the 2007 and 2014/15 waves of the 
Indonesian Family Life Survey. Next, I used Poisson-regression parametric 
g-formulas to directly estimate age-specific mortality rates under different 
blood pressure control strategies and constructed period life expectancies using 
the observed and counterfactual mortality rates.
RESULTS: Fully controlling SBP to a population mean of under 125 mmHg was 
associated with a life expectancy gain at age 40 of 5.3 years [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 3.2, 7.4] for men and 6.0 years (95% CI: 3.6, 8.4) for women. The 
gains associated with blood pressure control were similar for both rich and poor 
subpopulations. The life expectancy gains under scenarios with imperfect blood 
pressure control and coverage were more modest in size and ranged between 1 and 
2.5 years for a large fraction of the scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: In Indonesia, elevated SBP carries a large mortality burden, though 
the results suggest that realistic efforts to address hypertension will likely 
produce more modest gains in life expectancy. Comparing improvements from 
different strategies and identifying the most cost-effective ways to introduce 
and scale up hypertension interventions is a critical focus for both research 
and policy.

OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the life expectancy of individuals with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Iran. This study therefore aimed to estimate the 
life expectancy of HIV-positive patients in Iran.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted data from the Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention of the Ministry of Health and Medical 
Education and the Death Registration System. We included patients aged 20 years 
and older who had a specified date of diagnosis. We estimated life expectancy 
and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Chiang's methodology.
RESULTS: The overall life expectancy at the national level was 23.1 years (95% 
CI, 22.6 to 23.5). Life expectancy was 21.6 years (95% CI, 21.1 to 22.0) for men 
and 32.7 years (95% CI, 31.4 to 34.0) for women. The life expectancy of patients 
who did or did not receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) was 37.0 years (95% CI,
