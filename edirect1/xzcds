Economic evaluations are an important input to decision-making and 
priority-setting in the health care sector. Measuring preferences for health 
improvements, as the demand-side value (willingness to pay) of gaining a 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), is one relevant component in the 
interpretation of the results from health economic evaluations. Our article 
addresses whether willingness to pay for a QALY (WTP-Q) is sensitive to the size 
of the health differences and the probability for improvement. We use data from 
a contingent valuation survey based on 1400 respondents conducted in the spring 
of 2014. The results show that the expectation of sensitivity to scope, or 
higher WTP to the larger expected quality of life improvement, is not supported. 
We find WTP-Q values that conform reasonably well to previous studies in Sweden.

As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company (GlaxoSmithKline) that 
manufactures mepolizumab (Nucala®) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of mepolizumab for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. 
The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group 
(ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the 
independent evidence review group (ERG). The ERG produced a review of the 
evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of mepolizumab as add-on to 
standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC and omalizumab, based upon the 
company's submission to NICE. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the 
company's submission was based predominantly on three randomised controlled 
trials (DREAM, MENSA and SIRIUS) comparing add-on mepolizumab with placebo plus 
SoC. The relevant population was defined in terms of degree of asthma severity 
(four or more exacerbations in the previous year and/or dependency on 
maintenance oral corticosteroids [mOCS]) and degree of eosinophilia (a blood 
eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/µl in the previous year) based on post hoc 
subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials. Other subpopulations were considered 
throughout the appraisal, defined by different eosinophil measurements, number 
of exacerbations and dependency (or lack thereof) on mOCS. Statistically 
significant reductions in clinically significant exacerbations were observed in 
patients receiving mepolizumab compared with SoC meta-analysed across MENSA and 
DREAM in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population (rate ratio [RR] 0.51; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.62) as well as in the relevant population 
(RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36-0.62). In terms of quality of life, differences on the St. 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire in MENSA for add-on subcutaneous mepolizumab 
100 mg vs. placebo were 7 and 7.5 units in the modified ITT and relevant 
populations, respectively. A number of issues in the clinical evidence base 
warrant caution in its interpretation. The ERG noted that the definition of SoC 
used in the trials differed from that in clinical practice, where patients with 
severe uncontrolled asthma start treatment with a mOCS. The company's economic 
post-consultation analysis incorporating a confidential patient access scheme 
(PAS) estimated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for add-on 
mepolizumab compared with SoC was £27,418 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained in the relevant population if patients stopped mepolizumab after 1 year 
unless (1) the number of exacerbations decreased at least 50% or (2) a reduction 
in corticosteroids dose was achieved whilst maintaining asthma control. The ERG 
applied an age adjustment to all utilities and corrected the post-continuation 
assessment utilities, which resulted in an ICER for add-on mepolizumab compared 
with SoC of £29,163 per QALY gained. The ERG noted that this ICER was not robust 
for patients who continued treatment due to a corticosteroid dose reduction 
where exacerbations had decreased by less than 50%, because corticosteroid dose 
reduction was not allowed in the main trial in which the evidence was gathered 
(MENSA). The NICE appraisal committee (AC) concluded that add-on mepolizumab 
could be recommended as an option for treating severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma in adults for the relevant population when the stopping rule suggested by 
the company was applied. The AC also concluded that the comparison between 
mepolizumab and omalizumab was not clinically relevant or methodologically 
robust.

The Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) comprises 22 countries or territories 
spanning from Morocco in the west to Pakistan in the east, and contains a 
population of almost 600 million people. Like many other developing regions, the 
burden of disease in the EMR has shifted in the past 30 years from primarily 
communicable diseases to noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Cardiovascular mortality in the EMR, mostly attributable to ischaemic 
heart disease, is expected to increase more dramatically in the next decade than 
in any other region except Africa. The most prominent CVD risk factors in this 
region include tobacco consumption, physical inactivity, depression, obesity, 
hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Many individuals living in the EMR are 
unaware of their risk factor status, and even if treated, these risk factors are 
often poorly controlled. Furthermore, infrequent use of emergency medical 
services, delays in access to care, and lack of access to cardiac 
catheterization affects the timely diagnosis of CVD. Treatment of CVD is also 
suboptimal in this region, consisting primarily of thrombolysis, with 
insufficient provision of timely revascularization. In this Review, we summarize 
what is known about CVD burden, risk factors, and treatment strategies for 
individuals living in the EMR. This information will hopefully aid 
decision-makers when devising strategies on how to improve CVD prevention and 
management in this region.

Much concern has been raised around the potential impact of the retirement of 
the large baby boom generation. This article specifically addresses the unique 
issues surrounding the retirement of female baby boomers. Demographic changes, 
including increased labor force participation, coupled with declining fertility 
rates, have resulted in a social transformation of the roles women play in 
society. Despite these changes, women still bear much of the caregiving 
responsibilities in the household, which can complicate retirement choices. This 
article examines female retirement in the Canadian context and presents three 
policy proposals to expand women's retirement choices, encourage longer-term 
labor force participation, and thereby extend their working lives into the Third 
Age.

BACKGROUND: PM2.5 precursor emissions have declined over the course of several 
decades, following the implementation of local, state, and federal air quality 
policies. Estimating the corresponding change in population exposure and 
PM2.5-attributable risk of death prior to the year 2000 is made difficult by the 
lack of PM2.5 monitoring data.
OBJECTIVES: We used a new technique to estimate historical PM2.5 concentrations, 
and estimated the effects of changes in PM2.5 population exposures on mortality 
in adults (age ≥30y), and on life expectancy at birth, in the contiguous United 
States during 1980-2010.
METHODS: We estimated annual mean county-level PM2.5 concentrations in 1980, 
1990, 2000, and 2010 using universal kriging incorporating geographic variables. 
County-level death rates and national life tables for each year were obtained 
from the U.S. Census and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used 
log-linear and nonlinear concentration-response coefficients from previous 
studies to estimate changes in the numbers of deaths and in life years and life 
expectancy at birth, attributable to changes in PM2.5.
RESULTS: Between 1980 and 2010, population-weighted PM2.5 exposures fell by 
about half, and the estimated number of excess deaths declined by about a third. 
The States of California, Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia had some of the 
largest estimated reductions in PM2.5-attributable deaths. Relative to a 
counterfactual population with exposures held constant at 1980 levels, we 
estimated that people born in 2050 would experience an ∼1-y increase in life 
expectancy at birth, and that there would be a cumulative gain of 4.4 million 
life years among adults ≥30y of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest that declines in PM2.5 exposures between 1980 
and 2010 have benefitted public health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP507.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of frailty across three Chinese 
populations: Hong Kong, Taiwan-urban and Taiwan-rural. Contributing factors to 
disparities in frailty were also examined. Data were derived from the 
Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOs) and Women (MsOs) (Hong Kong) Study (n = 
4000) and the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (n = 2392). Frailty was defined 
as an index calculated from 30 multiple deficits. The ratio of the frailty index 
to life expectancy at birth (FI/LE) was used as an indicator of compression of 
morbidity. Frailty was more prevalent in Taiwan-urban (33.1%) and Taiwan-rural 
(38.1%) compared to Hong Kong (16.6%, p < 0.05) and was higher in women 
(22.6-49.7%) than in men (10.5-27.5%, p < 0.05). The ratios of FI/LE were higher 
in Taiwan-urban and Taiwan-rural (both 0.27) compared to Hong Kong (0.20, p < 
0.05). Multivariate analyses revealed that older age, being a woman and low 
levels of physical activity were common risk factors for frailty across the 
three populations. Alcohol use was inversely associated with frailty in both 
Hong Kong and Taiwan-urban populations, but not in Taiwan-rural. Living alone 
was associated with frailty in Hong Kong men, but not in Hong Kong women or 
Taiwanese people. For all study populations, older age and being a woman 
constituted the highest attributable factor. This comparison provides useful 
data to inform government policies.

BACKGROUND: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common illness in China 
that mainly affects infants and children. The objective of this study is to 
assess the economic cost and health-related quality of life associated with HFMD 
in China.
METHOD: A telephone survey of caregivers were conducted in 31 provinces across 
China. Caregivers of laboratory-confirmed HFMD patients who were registered in 
the national HFMD enhanced surveillance database during 2012-2013 were invited 
to participate in the survey. Total costs included direct medical costs 
(outpatient care, inpatient care and self-medication), direct non-medical costs 
(transportation, nutrition, accommodation and nursery), and indirect costs for 
lost income associated with caregiving. Health utility weights elicited using 
EuroQol EQ-5D-3L and EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to calculate 
associated loss in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The subjects comprised 1136 mild outpatients, 1124 mild inpatients, 
1170 severe cases and 61 fatal cases. The mean total costs for mild outpatients, 
mild inpatients, severe cases and fatal cases were $201 (95%CI $187, $215), 
$1072 (95%CI $999, $1144), $3051 (95%CI $2905, $3197) and $2819 (95%CI $2068, 
$3571) respectively. The mean QALY losses per HFMD episode for mild outpatients, 
mild inpatients and severe cases were 3.6 (95%CI 3.4, 3,9), 6.9 (95%CI 6.4, 7.4) 
and 13.7 (95%CI 12.9, 14.5) per 1000 persons. Cases who were diagnosed with 
EV-A71 infection and had longer duration of illness were associated with higher 
total cost and QALY loss.
CONCLUSION: HFMD poses a high economic and health burden in China. Our results 
provide economic and health utility data for cost-effectiveness analysis for 
HFMD vaccination in China.

BACKGROUND: The contact biomechanics of the trapeziometacarpal joint have been 
investigated in several studies. However, these led to conflicting results and 
were mostly performed in vitro. The purpose of this study was to provide further 
insight on the contact biomechanics of the trapeziometacarpal joint by in vivo 
assessment of healthy and osteoarthritic subjects.
METHODS: The hands of 16 healthy women and 6 women with trapeziometacarpal 
osteoarthritis were scanned in positions of maximal thumb extension, flexion, 
abduction and adduction during three isometric tasks (lateral key pinch, power 
grasp and jar twist) and in thumb rest posture (relaxed neutral). 
Three-dimensional surface models of the trapezium and first metacarpal were 
created for each thumb configuration. The articular surface of each bone was 
measured in the neutral posture. A computed tomography-based proximity mapping 
algorithm was developed to calculate the distance between opposing joint 
surfaces, which was used as a surrogate for intra-articular stress.
FINDINGS: Distinct proximity patterns were observed across tasks with a 
recurrent pattern reported on the volar aspect of the first metacarpal. The 
comparison between healthy and arthritic subjects showed a significantly larger 
articular area, in parallel with a significant joint space narrowing and an 
increase in proximity area in arthritic subjects. We also observed severe 
articular deformations in subjects with late stage osteoarthritis.
INTERPRETATION: This study has increased our insight in the contact biomechanics 
of the trapeziometacarpal joint during tasks and positions of daily life in 
healthy and arthritic subjects, which might contribute to a better understanding 
of the occurrence mechanisms of degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis.

Untangling Longevity, Dauer, and Healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans 
Insulin/IGF-1-Signalling.

Technology, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland.

The groundbreaking discovery that lower levels of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) 
can induce lifespan extension was reported 24 years ago in the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans. In this organism, mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 
receptor gene daf-2 or other genes in this pathway can double lifespan. 
Subsequent work has revealed that reduced IIS (rIIS) extends lifespan across 
diverse species, possibly including humans. In C. elegans, IIS also regulates 
development into the diapause state known as dauer, a quiescent larval form that 
enables C. elegans to endure harsh environments through morphological 
adaptation, improved cellular repair, and slowed metabolism. Considerable 
progress has been made uncovering mechanisms that are affected by C. elegans 
rIIS. However, from the beginning it has remained unclear to what extent rIIS 
extends C. elegans lifespan by mobilizing dauer-associated mechanisms in adults. 
As we discuss, recent work has shed light on this question by determining that 
rIIS can extend C. elegans lifespan comparably through downstream processes that 
are either dauer-related or -independent. Importantly, these two lifespan 
extension programs can be distinguished genetically. It will now be critical to 
tease apart these programs, because each may involve different 
longevity-promoting mechanisms that may be relevant to higher organisms. A 
recent analysis of organismal "healthspan" has questioned the value of C. 
elegans rIIS as a paradigm for understanding healthy aging, as opposed to simply 
extending life. We discuss other work that argues strongly that C. elegans rIIS 
is indeed an invaluable model and consider the likely possibility that 
dauer-related processes affect parameters associated with health under rIIS 
conditions. Together, these studies indicate that C. elegans and analyses of 
rIIS in this organism will continue to provide unexpected and exciting results, 
and new paradigms that will be valuable for understanding healthy aging in 
humans.

With a low breast cancer incidence and low population density, Greenland is 
geographically and organisationally challenged in implementing a cost effective 
breast cancer screening programme where a large proportion of the Greenlandic 
women will have to travel far to attend. The aim of this paper is to evaluate 
the cost effectiveness and cost utility of different strategies for implementing 
population-based breast cancer screening in Greenland. Two strategies were 
evaluated: Centralised screening in the capital Nuuk and decentralised screening 
in the five municipal regions of Greenland. A cost effectiveness and cost 
utility analysis were performed from a societal perspective to estimate the 
costs per years of life saved and per QALY gained. Two accommodation models for 
the women's attendance were examined; accommodation in ordinary hotels or in 
patient hotels. The least costly accommodation model was the hotel model 
compared with the patient hotel model, regardless of screening strategy. The 
decentralised strategy was more cost effective compared with the centralised 
strategy, resulting in 0.5 million DKK per years of life saved (YLS) and 4.1 
million DKK per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained within the hotel model. 
These ratios are significantly higher compared with findings from other 
countries. The sensitivity analysis showed a substantial gap between the most 
and least favourable model assumptions. The investigated strategies were all 
estimated to be extremely costly, mostly due to high transportation and 
accommodation costs and loss of productivity, and none would be accepted as 
cost-effective per YLS/QALY gained within a conventional threshold level. The 
least expensive strategy was regional screening with hotel accommodation.

BACKGROUND: In an era of worldwide population displacement, recent studies have 
identified strong associations between social situations and perinatal outcomes 
among immigrants. Little is known about the effect of maternal social background 
on pregnancy outcomes. The Human Development Index (HDI) assesses the following 
dimensions of human development: life expectancy, education level and income. 
The objective of our study was to determine if maternal HDI may be used to 
identify women at increased odds of poor pregnancy outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal population-based study in a tertiary centre 
in Madrid, Spain. The outcome variables were maternal and perinatal/antenatal 
mortality, preeclampsia (PE), low birth weight (LBW), gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery (PTD) before 37 and 34 gestational weeks, 
abnormal cardiotocography (CTG) during delivery, C-section (CS) due to abnormal 
CTG, pH < 7.10 at birth, Apgar at 5 min ≤ 7, and resuscitation type ≥3. We 
performed multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential 
confounding variables to evaluate the associations between maternal HDI and 
perinatal outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 38,719 singleton infants who were born in our maternity ward 
between 2010 and 2016 and had perinatal outcome data available were included in 
this study. The neonates of women from medium/low HDI countries had 
significantly lower odds of low birth weight (LBW) than their very high HDI 
country counterparts (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0.72). However, the odds of PTD 
before 37 gestational weeks and PE were higher in the medium/low HDI group than 
the very high HDI group (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.53; OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.79, 
respectively). Poorer neonatal outcomes were identified in the medium/low HDI 
group than the very high HDI group, including greater odds of abnormal CTG, CS 
due to abnormal CTG and Apgar 2 ≤ 7 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the infants of mothers from medium/low 
HDI had lower odds of LBW but higher odds of PTD, PE and poor neonatal outcomes. 
These results support the hypothesis that maternal HDI can be used to understand 
the impact of maternal origin on pregnancy outcomes. Further studies are needed 
to confirm its validity.

OBJECTIVES: Our study addresses the important issue of estimating treatment 
costs from historical data. It is a problem frequently faced by health 
technology assessment analysts. We compared four approaches used to estimate 
current costs when good quality contemporary data are not available using liver 
transplantation as an example.
METHODS: First, the total cost estimates extracted for patients from a cohort 
study, conducted in the 1990s, were inflated using a published inflation 
multiplier. Second, resource use estimates from the cohort study were extracted 
for hepatitis C patients and updated using current unit costs. Third, expert 
elicitation was carried out to identify changes in clinical practice over time 
and quantify current resource use. Fourth, routine data on resource use were 
obtained from National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).
RESULTS: The first two methods did not account for changes in clinical practice. 
Also the first was not specific to hepatitis patients. The use of experts 
confirmed significant changes in clinical practice. However, the quantification 
of resource use using experts is challenging as clinical specialists may not 
have a complete overview of clinical pathway. The NHSBT data are the most 
accurate reflection of transplantation and posttransplantation phase; however, 
data were not available for the whole pathway of care. The best estimate of 
total cost, combining NHSBT data and expert elicitation, is £121,211.
DISCUSSION: Observational data from routine care are potentially the most 
reliable reflection of current resource use. Efforts should be made to make such 
data readily available and accessible to researchers. Expert elicitation 
provided reasonable estimates.

BACKGROUND: Previous reports have shown that lung cancer incidence and mortality 
were increasing both in male and female; however, the temporal trends in lung 
cancer eliminated life expectancy and potential years of life lost (PYLL) are 
very rare. Thus, we examine the temporal trends in lung cancer eliminated life 
expectancy and PYLL in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province, 1981-2015.
METHODS: Data were collected from vital registry of Kunshan city. Lung cancer 
eliminated life expectancy and the PYLL were calculated by sex. The Chinese 
population in 2000 was used to calculate age-standardized PYLL. Estimate annual 
percentage changes (eAPC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to examine 
the temporal trendss.
RESULTS: During 1981 to 2015, substantially increasing trend was observed for 
the lung cancer eliminated life expectancy, which increased by 0.34 years in 
1981 to 0.86 in 2015 (APC=3.2%, 95%CI: 2.8%-3.6%), and a significant increasing 
trend was found for male (APC=3.0%, 95%CI: 2.5%-3.5%) and female (APC=3.6%, 
95%CI: 3.0%-4.2%). Moreover, the age-standardized PYLL among both sex 
(APC=-0.1%, 95%CI: -0.6%-0.4%) and male (APC=-0.5%, 95%CI: -1.1%-0.1%) were 
stable, but increasing trend was observed in females (APC=1.5%, 95%CI: 
0.3%-2.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no significant change over the past 3 decades 
regarding the effect of premature deaths due to lung cancer, a substantial 
increasing trend was observed in lung cancer eliminated life expectancy, which 
suggested that targeted lung cancer prevention and control measures are urgently 
need.

Salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and listeriosis are food-borne diseases. We 
estimated and forecasted the number of cases of these three diseases in Belgium 
from 2012 to 2020, and calculated the corresponding number of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The salmonellosis time series was fitted 
with a Bai and Perron two-breakpoint model, while a dynamic linear model was 
used for campylobacteriosis and a Poisson autoregressive model for listeriosis. 
The average monthly number of cases of salmonellosis was 264 (standard deviation 
(SD): 86) in 2012 and predicted to be 212 (SD: 87) in 2020; campylobacteriosis 
case numbers were 633 (SD: 81) and 1,081 (SD: 311); listeriosis case numbers 
were 5 (SD: 2) in 2012 and 6 (SD: 3) in 2014. After applying correction factors, 
the estimated DALYs for salmonellosis were 102 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 
8-376) in 2012 and predicted to be 82 (95% UI: 6-310) in 2020; 
campylobacteriosis DALYs were 1,019 (95% UI: 137-3,181) and 1,736 (95% UI: 
178-5,874); listeriosis DALYs were 208 (95% UI: 192-226) in 2012 and 252 (95% 
UI: 200-307) in 2014. New actions are needed to reduce the risk of food-borne 
infection with Campylobacter spp. because campylobacteriosis incidence may 
almost double through 2020.

BACKGROUND: The current recommendation of using transrectal ultrasound-guided 
biopsy (TRUSB) to diagnose prostate cancer misses clinically significant (CS) 
cancers. More sensitive biopsies (eg, template prostate mapping biopsy [TPMB]) 
are too resource intensive for routine use, and there is little evidence on 
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI).
OBJECTIVE: To identify the most effective and cost-effective way of using these 
tests to detect CS prostate cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cost-effectiveness modelling of health 
outcomes and costs of men referred to secondary care with a suspicion of 
prostate cancer prior to any biopsy in the UK National Health Service using 
information from the diagnostic Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS).
INTERVENTION: Combinations of MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, using different 
definitions and diagnostic cut-offs for CS cancer.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Strategies that detect the most 
CS cancers given testing costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) given long-term costs.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The use of MPMRI first and then up to two MRI-targeted 
TRUSBs detects more CS cancers per pound spent than a strategy using TRUSB first 
(sensitivity = 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.92-0.98] vs 0.91 [95% CI 
0.86-0.94]) and is cost effective (ICER = £7,076 [€8350/QALY gained]). The 
limitations stem from the evidence base in the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy 
and the long-term outcomes of men with CS prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: An MPMRI-first strategy is effective and cost effective for the 
diagnosis of CS prostate cancer. These findings are sensitive to the test costs, 
sensitivity of MRI-targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with cancer, 
which warrant more empirical research. This analysis can inform the development 
of clinical guidelines.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We found that, under certain assumptions, the use of 
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging first and then up to two transrectal 
ultrasound-guided biopsy is better than the current clinical standard and is 
good value for money.

The indicating FTA elute micro card™ has been developed to collect and stabilize 
the nucleic acid in biological samples and is widely used in human and 
veterinary medicine and other disciplines. This card is not recommended for 
protein analyses, since surface treatment may denature proteins. We studied the 
ability to analyse proteins in human plasma and vaginal fluid as applied to the 
indicating FTA elute micro card™ using the sensitive proximity extension assay 
(PEA). Among 92 proteins in the Proseek Multiplex Oncology Iv2 panel, 87 were 
above the limit of detection (LOD) in liquid plasma and 56 among 92 above LOD in 
plasma applied to FTA cards. Washing and protein elution protocols were compared 
to identify an optimal method. Liquid-based cytology samples showed a lower 
number of proteins above LOD than FTA cards with vaginal fluid samples applied. 
Our results demonstrate that samples applied to the indicating FTA elute micro 
card™ are amendable to protein analyses, given that a sensitive protein 
detection assay is used. The results imply that biological samples applied to 
FTA cards can be used for DNA, RNA and protein detection.

As a revolutionary technology for life sciences, RNA-seq has many applications 
and the computation pipeline has also many variations. Here, we describe a 
protocol to perform RNA-seq data analysis where the aim is to identify 
differentially expressed genes in comparisons of two conditions. The protocol 
follows the recently published RNA-seq data analysis best practice and applies 
quality checkpoints throughout the analysis to ensure reliable data 
interpretation. It is written to help new RNA-seq users to understand the basic 
steps necessary to analyze an RNA-seq dataset properly. An extension of the 
protocol has been implemented as automated workflows in the R package ezRun, 
available also in the data analysis framework SUSHI, for reliable, repeatable, 
and easily interpretable analysis results.

Defining thresholds of prognostic markers is essential for stratified medicine. 
Such thresholds are mostly estimated from purely statistical measures regardless 
of patient preferences potentially leading to unacceptable medical decisions. 
Quality-Adjusted Life-Years are a widely used preferences-based measure of 
health outcomes. We develop a time-dependent Quality-Adjusted Life-Years-based 
expected utility function for censored data that should be maximized to estimate 
an optimal threshold. We performed a simulation study to compare estimated 
thresholds when using the proposed expected utility approach and purely 
statistical estimators. Two applications illustrate the usefulness of the 
proposed methodology which was implemented in the R package ROCt ( www.divat.fr 
). First, by reanalysing data of a randomized clinical trial comparing the 
efficacy of prednisone vs. placebo in patients with chronic liver cirrhosis, we 
demonstrate the utility of treating patients with a prothrombin level higher 
than 89%. Second, we reanalyze the data of an observational cohort of kidney 
transplant recipients: we conclude to the uselessness of the Kidney Transplant 
Failure Score to adapt the frequency of clinical visits. Applying such a 
patient-centered methodology may improve future transfer of novel prognostic 
scoring systems or markers in clinical practice.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective data collection study with application of 
metastatic spine scoring systems.
OBJECTIVES: To apply the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi scoring systems to a 
surgical cohort at a single academic institution and analyze spine-related 
surgical morbidity and mortality rates.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical management of metastatic spine patients 
requires tools that can accurately predict patient survival, as well as 
knowledge of morbidity and mortality rates.
METHODS: An Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Spine Center surgical 
database was queried (years 2002-2010) to identify patients with an ICD-9 code 
indicative of metastatic spine disease. Patients whose only surgical treatment 
was vertebral augmentation were not included. Scatter plots of survival versus 
the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi metastatic spine scoring systems were 
statistically analyzed. Spine-related morbidity and mortality rates were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were identified: 45 patients' (30 male patients, 
mean age 45 y) medical records included operative, morbidity, and mortality 
statistic data and 38 (26 male patients, mean age 54 y) contained complete 
metastatic spine scoring system data. Of the 38 deceased spine metastatic 
patients, 8 had renal cell, 7 lung, 4 breast, 2 chondrosarcoma, 2 prostate, 11 
other, and 4 unknown primary cancers. Linear regression analysis revealed R 
values of 0.2570 and 0.2009 for the revised Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring 
systems, respectively. Overall transfusion, infection, morbidity, and mortality 
rates were 33% and 9%, and 42% and 9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of metastatic prognostic scoring systems to a 
retrospective surgical cohort revealed an overall poor correlation with the 
Tomita and revised Tokuhashi predictive survival models. Morbidity and mortality 
rates concur with those in the medical literature. This study underscores the 
difficulty in utilizing metastatic spine scoring systems to predict patient 
survival. We believe a scoring system based on cancer type is needed to account 
for changes in treatment paradigms with improved patient survival over time.

In utero exposure to the endocrine disrupting compound bisphenol A (BPA) is 
known to disrupt mammary gland development and increase tumor susceptibility in 
rodents. It is unclear whether different periods of in utero development might 
be more susceptible to BPA exposure. We exposed pregnant CD-1 mice to BPA at 
different times during gestation that correspond to specific milestones of in 
utero mammary gland development. The mammary glands of early-life and adult 
female mice, exposed in utero to BPA, were morphologically and molecularly 
(estrogen receptor-α and Ki67) evaluated for developmental abnormalities. We 
found that BPA treatment occurring before mammary bud invasion into the 
mesenchyme [embryonic day (E)12.5] incompletely resulted in the measured 
phenotypes of mammary gland defects. Exposing mice up to the point at which the 
epithelium extends into the precursor fat pad (E16.5) resulted in a nearly 
complete BPA phenotype and exposure during epithelial extension (E15.5 to E18.5) 
resulted in a partial phenotype. Furthermore, the relative differences in 
phenotypes between exposure windows highlight the substantial correlations 
between early-life molecular changes (estrogen receptor-α and Ki67) in the 
stroma and the epithelial elongation defects in mammary development. These data 
further implicate BPA action in the stroma as a critical mediator of epithelial 
phenotypes.
