OBJECTIVES: Population norms for the EQ-5D-5L were published in Canada but only 
for Alberta province. The purpose of this study was to derive Quebec population 
norms from the EQ-5D-5L.
METHODS: The data came from a larger study conducted between September 2016 and 
March 2018 using elicitation techniques for a quality-adjusted life-year 
project. The online survey was distributed randomly in the province of Quebec. 
To best describe the entire population, data were stratified by various 
sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, urban and rural 
populations, whether disadvantaged or not, immigrant or nonimmigrant, and health 
problems.
RESULTS: A total of 2704 (53.8%) respondents completed the EQ-5D-5L. Mean (95% 
confidence interval) and median (interquartile range) utility scores were 0.824 
(0.818-0.829) and 0.867 (0.802-0.911), respectively. The EQ-VAS scores were 
estimated at 75.9 (75.2-76.6) and 80 (69-90). Subjects with lower scores were 
those who had a low or high body mass index; were smokers; were single, 
divorced, or widowed; had no children; were unemployed or sick; had lower 
education or lower annual income; and had a family or personal history of 
serious illness. Immigrants had higher scores. There was no difference in gender 
and urban or rural population. The score logically decreased with worsening 
health status, from a mean score of 0.896 (0.884-0.908) to 0.443 (0.384-0.501; P 
< .0001. Similar results were observed for subjects' satisfaction with their 
health or life. Subjects with lower scores were less willing to take risks. 
Subjects who declared they were affected by health problems presented 
significant lower utility scores, ranging from 0.554 (nervous problem) to 0.750 
(cancer), compared with those without health problems (0.871; confidence 
interval: 0.867-0.876).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to present utility score norms for EQ-5D-5L 
for the Quebec population. These results will be useful for comparison with 
quality-adjusted life-year studies to better interpret their results. Moreover, 
utility norms were provided for 21 health problems, which was rarely done.

BACKGROUND: The global burden of pancreatic cancer (PCa) continues to grow. 
Detailed data on PCa epidemiology are essential for policy-making and 
appropriate healthcare resource allocation.
METHODS: Estimates of incidence, death and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of PCa from 1990 to 2017 were collected from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017. Decomposition analysis was conducted to detect the 
contributing factors related to PCa incidence variation. The estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the PCa epidemiology trends 
over a specified interval.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence of PCa cases increased by 129.1% to 447 664 664 
(95% uncertainty interval (UI) 438 597-456 295), death increased by 125.2% to 
441 082 082 (95% UI 448 960-432 833), and DALYs increased by 107.3% to 9 080 004 
(95% UI 8 894 128-9 256 346) between 1990 and 2017. Relatively higher 
sociodemographic index (SDI) regions were observed with greater incidences, more 
deaths and a greater number of DALYs of PCa, but relatively lower SDI regions 
experienced a sharply increasing trend in these measures. Decomposition analysis 
indicated that the global increase in PCa incidence was driven by the aging 
population from 2007 to 2017, especially in higher SDI regions. In addition, a 
significant negative correlation was found between EAPC and ASIR (in 1990) 
(r = -0.56, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: PCa remains a major public health burden globally. The unfavorable 
trend in PCa suggesting that further study for prevention should be conducted to 
forestall the increase in pancreatic cancer.

AIM: In 1999, a cooperative tripartite cancer research and training agreement 
was signed between Ireland (IE), Northern Ireland (NI) and the United States 
(US) National Cancer Institute, giving rise to the All-Ireland Cancer Consortium 
(AICC). We wished to consider if AICC increased the amount/impact of cancer 
research on the island of Ireland and what effect this enhanced research 
activity had on cancer services and cancer outcomes.
METHODS: As comparator, we chose the city regions of Copenhagen and Lund & 
Malmö, whose physical connection was greatly improved following construction of 
bridges between Denmark and Sweden around the time AICC was established. We 
analysed cancer research outputs from all four geographical regions in the Web 
of Science (1988-2017), with a particular focus on citations and journal impact 
factors. We evaluated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as an indicator of 
change in health status.
RESULTS: Research outputs increased in all four regions, but more in IE/NI than 
in the Scandinavian cities, while collaboration between IE and NI and both the 
US and the Rest of Europe increased even more substantially. Citation scores 
also showed a greater improvement for IE and NI. Journal citation impact factors 
indicated that IE/NI papers were increasingly being published in more highly 
cited journals. Research-enabled cancer service provision improved on the island 
of Ireland, with concomitant increases in cancer survival.
CONCLUSION: The AICC collaborative agreement delivered significant additionality 
on the island of Ireland, promoting transnational cooperation, enhancing cancer 
research activity, and underpinning improved cancer services and better cancer 
outcomes.

Prognostic scoring system for metastatic spine tumors derived from 
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, School of Medicine, Nihon University, 
Tokyo, Japan.

PURPOSE: The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has recently improved, 
and so clinicians have greater opportunity to treat HCC-derived spinal 
metastases. Therefore, predicting life expectancy is important for determining 
the optimal treatment strategy for such tumors. This study aimed to investigate 
the prognostic factors for HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors and to develop a 
scoring system for predicting life expectancy in such cases.
METHODS: The posttreatment survival time and factors that might influence it 
were investigated in 62 patients with HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors who 
were treated at our department (surgery: 27 patients and conservative treatment: 
35 patients), and a prognostic scoring system for predicting life expectancy was 
developed by combining the factors that significantly influenced survival.
RESULTS: In the univariate analyses, sex, the patient's general condition, the 
presence/absence of major internal organ metastasis, the total revised Tokuhashi 
score, the serum albumin level, Child-Pugh class, spinal surgery, and 
bone-modifying agent (BMA) treatment were found to influence the posttreatment 
survival time. These factors were subjected to multivariate analysis, and a 
novel scoring system for predicting life expectancy based on the patient's 
general condition, the serum albumin level (or Child-Pugh class), and BMA 
treatment was developed. In the retrospective analysis, the concordance rate 
between the patients' life expectancy and actual survival times was 90.3%.
CONCLUSION: The patient's general condition, the serum albumin level (or 
Child-Pugh class), and BMA treatment influenced the posttreatment survival times 
of patients with HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors. A prognostic scoring 
system based on these factors was proposed.

BACKGROUND: Patients with distributive shock who are unresponsive to traditional 
vasopressors are commonly considered to have severe distributive shock and are 
at high mortality risk. Here, we assess the cost-effectiveness of adding 
angiotensin II to the standard of care (SOC) for severe distributive shock in 
the US critical care setting from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: Short-term mortality outcomes were based on 28-day survival rates from 
the ATHOS-3 study. Long-term outcomes were extrapolated to lifetime survival 
using individually estimated life expectancies for survivors. Resource use and 
adverse event costs were drawn from the published literature. Health outcomes 
evaluated were lives saved, life-years gained, and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained using utility estimates for the US adult population weighted for 
sepsis mortality. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed 
uncertainty around results. We analyzed patients with severe distributive shock 
from the ATHOS-3 clinical trial.
RESULTS: The addition of angiotensin II to the SOC saved .08 lives at Day 28 
compared to SOC alone. The cost per life saved was estimated to be $108,884. The 
addition of angiotensin II to the SOC was projected to result in a gain of .96 
life-years and .66 QALYs. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $12,843 per QALY. The probability of angiotensin II being 
cost-effective at a threshold of $50,000 per QALY was 86 percent.
CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of severe distributive shock, angiotensin II is 
cost-effective at acceptable thresholds.

PURPOSE: To analyze clinical, therapeutic and prognostic features of pediatric 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 16 eyes of 8 children 
diagnosed with VKH disease followed at a teaching hospital over a 10 year 
period. Diagnosis was based on the revised criteria of VKH disease. All data 
were analyzed using SPSS® software.
RESULTS: There were 62.5% girls and 37.5% boys. The mean age (years) was 
14.6±4.4. The mean follow-up (months) was 38.7±28.7. The mean initial visual 
acuity (VA) (LogMAR) was 1.4 with 68.8% of eyes presenting with severe visual 
loss at admission. The median time (days) required for resorption of the serous 
retinal detachment was 10 [8.25-25]. Extraocular signs were present in 62.5% of 
cases. The mean time until initiation of treatment was 25.6 days. 62.5% of 
patients received corticosteroids alone, and 37.5% of patients received a 
combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. Final VA was 0.4 
[0.1-2.3]. In our study, the time until consultation, low initial VA and 
recurrences were statistically associated with severe visual loss (P≤0.05).
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy in pediatric cases of VKH disease justifies the 
early initiation of immunosuppressive treatment or even biological therapy to 
achieve better steroid sparing and preserve visual function.

Cost-effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccination in children with medical 
risk conditions in the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: In many countries, annual immunization with inactivated influenza 
vaccine (IIV) is recommended for children with medical risk conditions. Prior 
cost-effectiveness analyses found such immunization to be cost saving, but 
assumed effectiveness against non-severe influenza outcomes and a higher 
effectiveness against severe influenza outcomes than recent studies would 
suggest. However, recent vaccine studies do not indicate any reduction in 
community or outpatient disease episodes in IIV immunized individuals. We 
therefore evaluated cost-effectiveness of IIV immunization in children with 
medical risk conditions in the Netherlands, assuming that IIV reduces 
influenza-related hospitalization and death, but has no meaningful impact on 
non-severe health outcomes.
METHODS: A health economic decision tree model was developed to evaluate health 
effects and costs of annual IIV immunization versus no immunization. Model 
inputs were based on our study on influenza-related primary care visits and 
other literature. Immunization was considered cost effective if associated costs 
were less than €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of 
results, and one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were done to 
assess the influence of individual parameters.
RESULTS: Annual IIV prevents an average of 1.59 influenza-related 
hospitalizations and 0.02 deaths per 1,000 children with medical risk 
conditions. This results in an expected QALY gain of 0.43 at incremental costs 
of €21,564 per 1,000 children, corresponding to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €50,297/QALY compared to no immunization. 
Under base case assumptions, immunization had a 5% probability of being cost 
effective. Results were most influenced by vaccine efficacy against fatal 
influenza, QALY loss due to death, and mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: If IIV only reduces severe disease outcomes, as current evidence 
suggests, annual immunization of medical risk children is unlikely to be cost 
effective. Results should however be interpreted with caution as 
cost-effectiveness is largely dependent on incidence and QALY losses for fatal 
influenza, for which evidence is scarce.

OBJECTIVE: Long term survival after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) 
in octogenarians remains unclear. This was evaluated by comparing octogenarians 
after EVAR with a matched group of octogenarians without an abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (AAA) from the Rotterdam Study (RS). The influence of complications 
after EVAR on survival was also studied with the aim of identifying risk factors 
for the development of complications in octogenarians.
METHODS: Using propensity score matching (PSM), 83 EVAR octogenarians were 
matched for comorbidities with 83 octogenarians from the RS, and survival was 
compared between these two groups using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Then, 
complications were studied, defined as cardiac or pulmonary, renal 
deterioration, access site bleeding, acute limb ischaemia or bowel ischaemia, 
within 30 days of surgery between 83 EVAR octogenarians and 475 EVAR 
non-octogenarians. Also, the difference in baseline characteristics between the 
octogenarians with and without complications after EVAR were studied, and 
survival was compared between the RS controls and the complicated and 
uncomplicated EVAR octogenarians separately.
RESULTS: The total EVAR octogenarian population did not show an increased 
mortality risk compared with RS octogenarian controls (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-1.97). Post-operative complications occurred 
in 22 octogenarians (27%) and 59 non-octogenarians (12.4%, p < .001), mainly 
cardiac, pulmonary, and bleeding complications. All baseline characteristics 
were similar in the complicated EVAR octogenarians compared with the 
uncomplicated EVAR octogenarians. After uncomplicated EVAR, octogenarians had a 
similar survival compared with the RS controls (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68-1.77), but 
after complicated EVAR their mortality risk increased significantly (HR 1.93, 
95% CI 1.06-3.54).
CONCLUSION: After standard EVAR, the life expectancy of octogenarians is the 
same as that of a matched group from the general population without an AAA, 
provided they do not develop early post-operative complications. Patient 
selection and meticulous peri-operative care are key.

INTRODUCTION: Geriatric assessment may require a specific follow-up 
implementation during oncological treatment. The main objective of our study was 
the nurse phone questionnaire validation, in terms of feasibility, and 
concordance of data collected compared to a medical geriatric follow-up (blind) 
consultation carried out three months after the initial assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This interventional, prospective, multi-center study has 
included patients aged 70 years and over, referred to geriatric consultation 
before receiving oncological treatment. Patients with an estimated life 
expectancy less than three months, unable to communicate by telephone or to 
complete the written consent, with an ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group Performance Status) at four, or MMSE <18/30 (Mini Mental State 
Examination) were not included. Feasibility was considered if items were 
answered by phone for at least 80% of patients and, for concordance, if Cohen's 
Kappa coefficient was at least 0.7, between phone and consultation's answers 
data.
RESULTS: 131 patients were included with a median age of 81 years [70-95], 62.6% 
of women (n = 82). Phone questionnaires were completed for 78.6% of patients 
(n = 103) with a median duration of 12 min per call [5-37]. 95 patients have 
completed the study, for whom concordance was only found for IADL (Instrumental 
Activity of Daily Living) Medication-item.
CONCLUSION: It is important to define the profile of older patients treated for 
cancer who can benefit from phone follow-up. If a phone follow-up questionnaire 
carried out by a nurse is proven to be accurate, it would facilitate geriatric 
follow-up and space out consultations.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
(DIPG) are diseases that typically manifest in childhood and are associated with 
severely reduced life expectancy. However, there are currently no effective 
therapies for these diseases, which remain incurable. Activin receptor-like 
kinase-2 (ALK2), encoded by the ACVR1 gene, is a bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP) type-I receptor subtype that plays an important physiological role in the 
development of bones, muscles, brain, and other organs. Constitutively active 
mutants of ALK2 have been identified as causative of FOP and involved in the 
tumorigenesis of DIPG owing to abnormal activation of BMP signaling, and 
therefore have emerged as promising treatment targets. Here, we describe these 
two diseases, along with the link to ALK2 signal transduction, and highlight 
potential ALK2 inhibitors that are under development to offer new hope for 
patients with FOP and DIPG.

Age-related decreases of various physiological functions have significant 
influence on activities of daily living (ADL) and QOL in elderly populations. 
Mechanisms of aging are currently the focus of many researchers in a wide range 
of studies. Researchers are trying to find novel ways to attenuate or delay 
aging in humans as well as to develop interventions for age-associated diseases. 
In this review, we briefly discuss the need for a multidisciplinary approach in 
aging research.

Recently, aging is becoming an important social problem in many developed 
countries including Japan. It is socially and universally important to unveil 
the impact of aging and extend healthy life expectancy. Here we show our recent 
finding that dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11, also known as Zizimin2) may be 
involved in immunosenescence of B cells. DOCK11 was identified as a guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor for a small GTPase called cell division cycle 42. 
Expression of DOCK11 is restricted to lymphoid tissues, and becomes 
downregulated with age. Thus we examined the involvement of DOCK11 in 
immunosenescence of B-1a B cells as an example. B-1a cells are the main source 
of antibodies at steady state, and function as the first line of defense against 
infection. Although DOCK11 was expressed by B-1a cells, the expression levels 
declined with age. Furthermore, production of anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin M 
antibodies was suppressed in aged mice, and was recovered by adoptive transfer 
with B-1a cells in a DOCK11-dependent manner. Thus DOCK11 may be involved in 
immunosenescence of B-1a cells.

PURPOSE: To explore socioeconomic inequality in global burden of refraction 
disorders using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: World Bank categorical and national DALY numbers, crude rates and 
age-standardized rates caused by refraction disorders between 1990 and 2017 were 
obtained. Gini coefficient and concentration index were computed to assess 
trends in global health inequality in refraction disorders burden.
RESULTS: Lower middle-income countries had the highest burden of refraction 
disorders and greatest decline in age-standardized DALY rates of 15.9% (171.0 in 
1990; 143.8 in 2017), followed by upper middle-income countries, with a 9.7% 
decline (103.7 in 1990; 93.7 in 2017). High-income countries had the lowest 
age-standardized DALY rates (70.4 in 1990; 65.7 in 2017), while low-income 
countries had the lowest DALY numbers. Between-country inequality decreased, 
with Gini coefficient declining from 0.203 in 1990 to 0.184 in 2017. 
Socioeconomic-associated inequality also decreased, with concentration index 
changing from -0.060 in 1990 to -0.041 in 2017. Small peaks of DALY numbers and 
crude rates occurred in the age group of 5-9 years in countries with different 
income levels. An earlier occurrence of high peaks of DALY estimates in older 
adults had been observed in countries with lower income.
CONCLUSION: Middle-income countries are more burdened with refraction disorders 
but have achieved great progress in the last few decades. The global health 
improvement in refraction disorders has been accompanied by narrowing 
inequality. Older adults in lower income countries tend to suffer from 
refraction disorders at an earlier age, compared with older adults in higher 
income countries.

One of the main risk factors for brain diseases is aging. Recent studies have 
shown that aging is a progressive degenerative process associated with chronic 
low-level inflammation. The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important 
role in inflammation and has been associated with different brain (e.g., 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) or other age-related (osteoporosis, arthritis, 
cancer) diseases. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P2RX7 
gene have been identified, including the loss-of-function 1513A>C and 1405A>G 
SNPs, and the gain-of-function 489C>T and 1068G>A SNPs. We carried out a 
literature analysis to verify an association between P2RX7 SNPs' frequency and 
age. In 34 worldwide eligible studies (11.858 subjects) no correlation between 
1513CC genotype frequency and age emerged. On the contrary, analysis of European 
Caucasian cohorts (7.241 subjects) showed a significant increase in 1513CC 
frequency with age (P = 0.027). In agreement with these findings, analysis of 
two publicly available datasets, including USA Caucasian cohorts, unveiled an 
increased frequency of 1513CC and 489CC genotypes with age (P = 0.0055 and P = 
0.0019, respectively). Thus, hypomorphic P2RX7 genotypes may be positively 
selected with age in European and North American Caucasian populations. We 
hypothesize that Caucasian individuals bearing an anti-inflammatory P2X7R 
phenotype and living in high-income countries may have a longer life expectancy.

Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipoatrophy (BSCL) is characterized by near total 
fat atrophy, associated with the progressive development of metabolic 
complications. BSCL type 1 (BSCL1) is caused by mutations in AGPAT2, encoding 
1-acylglycerol-3phosphate-O-acyltransferase β (recently renamed lysophosphatidic 
acid acyltransferase beta), which catalyzes the transformation of 
lysophosphatidic acid in phosphatidic acid, the precursor of 
glycerophospholipids and triglycerides. BSCL1 is an autosomal recessive disease 
due to AGPAT2 pathogenic variants leading to a depletion of triglycerides inside 
the adipose organ, and to a defective signaling of key elements involved in 
proper adipogenesis. We herein investigated the characteristics of two AGPAT2 
variants in Caucasian Italian patients with Berardinelli-Seip congenital 
lipoatrophy. The first patient exhibited a novel homozygous nonsense c.430 C > T 
AGPAT2 mutation (p.Gln144*) predicting the synthesis of a truncated enzyme of 
approximately half of the proper size. The second patient harbored a homozygous 
AGPAT2 missense variant (p.Arg159Cys), never described previously in BSCL1 
patients: the segregation of the disease with the mutation in the pedigree of 
the family and the in silico analysis are compatible with a causative role of 
the p.Arg159Cys variant. We remark that BSCL1 can be clinically very 
heterogeneous at presentation and that the associated complications, occurring 
in the natural history of the disease, reduce life-expectancy. We point to the 
necessity for medical treatments capable of reducing the risk of cardiovascular 
death. In BSCL1 patients, the assessment of cardiovascular disease with 
conventional diagnostic means maybe particularly challenging.

Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) is a rare, highly aggressive pediatric 
brain tumor that originates in the pons. DIPG is untreatable and universally 
fatal, with a median life expectancy of less than a year. Resection is not an 
option, due to the anatomical location of the tumor, radiotherapy has limited 
effect and no chemotherapeutic or targeted treatment approach has proven to be 
successful. This poor prognosis is partly attributed to the tumor's highly 
infiltrative diffuse and invasive spread. Thus, targeting the invasive behavior 
of DIPG has the potential to be of therapeutic value. In order to target DIPG 
invasion successfully, detailed mechanistic knowledge on the underlying drivers 
is required. Here, we review both DIPG tumor cell's intrinsic molecular 
processes and extrinsic environmental factors contributing to DIPG invasion. 
Importantly, DIPG represents a heterogenous disease and through advances in 
whole-genome sequencing, different subtypes of disease based on underlying 
driver mutations are now being recognized. Recent evidence also demonstrates 
intra-tumor heterogeneity in terms of invasiveness and implies that highly 
infiltrative tumor subclones can enhance the migratory behavior of neighboring 
cells. This might partially be mediated by "tumor microtubes," long membranous 
extensions through which tumor cells connect and communicate, as well as through 
the secretion of extracellular vesicles. Some of the described processes 
involved in invasion are already being targeted in clinical trials. However, 
more research into the mechanisms of DIPG invasion is urgently needed and might 
result in the development of an effective therapy for children suffering from 
this devastating disease. We discuss the implications of newly discovered 
invasive mechanisms for therapeutic targeting and the challenges therapy 
development face in light of disease in the developing brain.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the most serious complications of 
transfusion therapy in the thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) population 
before 1990; in fact, since 1990 serological tests were made available to detect 
infection in blood donors. The iron chelation therapy has improved the life 
expectancy of these patients and, consequently, a decrease in death due to heart 
disease may be observed, as well as an increase in liver disease due to the iron 
overload and HCV infection that lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Until few years ago, the recommended therapy for HCV 
treatment consisted of pegylated-interferon alpha plus ribavirin, a therapy with 
important side effects. This treatment has been severely limited to thalassemic 
and SCD patients due to the hemolytic anemia induced by ribavirin causing an 
increase in the number of blood transfusions. The development of highly 
effective Direct-acting Antiviral Agents toward different viral genotypes has 
led to a real HCV eradication with negative viremia and sustained viral response 
between 90 and 98%. At the beginning some indications of Direct-acting Antiviral 
Agents administration were available for those patients exhibiting advanced 
cirrhosis or needing liver transplantation over time for the high costs of the 
new drugs. Recently, all treatment regimens can be used for patients with 
various HCV genotypes, different stages of liver disease, and comorbidities. The 
HCV eradication has also led to a marked improvement in the parameters of 
martial accumulation, demonstrating a synergic action also between the effect of 
antiviral therapy and iron chelation.

The life expectancy of thalassemia patients has increased significantly in 
recent years being the most "elderly" patients approaching or are over 50 years 
old. Consequently, patients' perspectives have changed, leading them to 
longer-term planning with a consequent increase in their reproductive potential 
and desire to have children. Crucial points in the management of pregnancy in 
thalassemia are the iron chelation therapy before and during pregnancy, the 
antithrombotic prophylaxis, the management of transfusion therapy according to 
the modified transfusion requirement, a cardiologic monitoring for hemodynamic 
changes that expose an increased risk of heart failure. Pregnancy in women with 
sickle cell disease is still associated with increased rates of maternal and 
fetal mortality and adverse outcomes. Maternal morbidity may be due to acute 
sickling crises, thromboembolism, infection, and chronic end-organ dysfunction, 
while neonatal outcomes may be intrauterine growth retardation, preterm 
delivery, small infants for gestational age, stillbirth, and neonatal death. The 
management of pregnancy in thalassemia and sickle cell disease requires to be 
approached by a multidisciplinary team and followed from the pre-conception 
phase until the post-partum period with a close monitoring of the maternal and 
fetal conditions, in order to ensure optimal outcome. This approach requires the 
application of well-defined protocols that cover all the critical aspects of 
pregnancies in women affected by these pathologies. We describe our experience 
of spontaneous and non-spontaneous pregnancies in patients with thalassemia 
major and intermedia and sickle cell disease followed between 1992 and 2018 at 
the Thalassemia Unit of S. Eugenio Hospital of Rome.

To examine the willingness to pay (WTP) for a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained among advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Viet Nam 
and to analyze the factors affecting an individual's WTP.A cross-sectional, 
contingent valuation study was conducted among 400 NSCLC patients across 6 
national hospitals in Viet Nam. Self-reported information was recorded from 
patients regarding their socio-demographic status, EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 dimensions) 
utility, EQ-5D vas, and WTP for 1 QALY gained. To explore the factors related to 
the WTP, Gamma Generalized Linear Model and multiple logistic regression tools 
were applied to analyze data.The overall mean and median of WTP/QALY among the 
NSCLC patients were USD $11,301 and USD $8002, respectively. Strong association 
was recorded between WTP/QALY amount and the patient's education, economic 
status, comorbidity status, and health utility.Government and policymakers 
should consider providing financial supports to disadvantaged groups to improve 
their access to life saving cancer treatment.

The article elaborates on research tasks determining the vector trends and key 
risks of actual models of self-preserving behavior of population in Russia on 
scale of national security level and searching the means of increasing 
effectiveness of regional demographic policy in area of developing effective 
self-preserving choices of life-style strategies. The results of sociological 
survey of the aspects of self-preserving behavior of residents of the central 
regions of the Russian Federation (the study was carried out on a quota sample, 
n = 1060) are analyzed. The study made it possible to answer the questions about 
the importance of health and to assess it identifying the groups of relative and 
absolute risk. The study provided following results: the importance factors 
affecting development of self-preserving behavioral patterns and choice 
trajectories among respondents, as well as motivation for health protection and 
for refusal to live longer. The most important factors turned out to be personal 
resources and family upbringing. The most powerful motivation was the desire for 
well-being, participation in children's lives and self-fulfillment. The results 
of the study made it possible to identify self-preserving perimeter of residents 
of the central part of Russia. Though being aware of and understanding the 
importance and priority of health, almost half of the respondents waive their 
responsibility for their own well-being and life expectancy and at the same time 
displaying a clear distrust of medical institutions. Such a position of 
non-resource situation foregrounds all the possible risks associated with both 
loss of health and the failure to maintain it at satisfactory level. The results 
of study confirm the research hypothesis that the groups of relative and 
absolute risk correlate with the groups choosing external locus of control over 
their health. The obtained data is the basis for empirical verification of the 
indices of self-preserving strategies and the starting point for forecast 
calculations of possible risks of national demographic policy.

Simultaneous analysis based on encoded fluorophores suffers from potential 
crosstalk between fluorophores and the limited number of colors that can be 
practically resolved. Inspired by nontrivial temporal patterns in living 
organisms, we developed a DNA-templated probe by utilizing DNA polymerase (DNAP) 
for multiplexed detection of nucleic acids. These probes use differential delay 
times of signaling by a DNAP-mediated extension to distinguish different 
targets, which serve as the primers. Taking advantage of the high processivity 
and the controllable kinetics of DNAP, we find that multiplexed detection can be 
achieved in homogeneous solution using a single fluorophore. As a proof of 
concept, we developed assays for genomic DNA from four different bacteria. In 
addition, we designed and implemented probes to undergo a single oscillation in 
signal as an alternative way for multiplexing. We anticipate this approach will 
find broad applications not only in sensing but also in synthetic DNA 
nanosystems.
