Burden of disease, research funding and innovation in the UK: Do new health 
technologies reflect research inputs and need?

Biostatistics, University of Birmingham, UK.

OBJECTIVES: New and emerging health technologies (innovation outputs) do not 
always reflect conditions representing the greatest disease burden. We examine 
the role of research and development (R&D) funding in this relationship, 
considering whether areas with fewer innovative outputs receive an appropriate 
share of funding relative to their disease burden.
METHODS: We report a retrospective observational study, comparing burden of 
disease with R&D funding and innovation output. UK disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) and deaths came from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2004 
Global Burden of Disease estimates; funding estimates from the UK Clinical 
Research Collaboration's 2006 Health Research Analysis; and innovation output 
was estimated by the number of new and emerging technologies reported by the 
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Horizon Scanning Centre between 
2000 and 2009.
RESULTS: Disease areas representing the biggest burden were generally associated 
with the most funding and innovation output; cancer, neuropsychiatric conditions 
and cardiovascular disease together comprised approximately two-thirds of DALYs, 
funding and reported technologies. Compared with DALYs, funding and technologies 
were disproportionately high for cancer, and technologies alone were 
disproportionately high for musculoskeletal conditions and endocrine/metabolic 
diseases. Neuropsychiatric conditions had comparatively few technologies 
compared to both DALYs and funding. The relationship between DALYs and 
innovation output appeared to be mediated by R&D funding.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between burden of disease and new and emerging 
health technologies for different disease areas is partly dependent on the 
associated level of R&D funding (input). Discrepancies among key groups may 
reflect differential focus of research funding across disease areas.

Protein-based therapeutics has become one of the most rapidly growing and 
successful drug class in the clinic. However, there are still a number of key 
challenges that need to be addressed before the full therapeutic potential of 
protein drugs can be realized. Of note, many biologically active proteins have 
very short in vivo half-lives, a fact that has greatly hindered their clinical 
applications. Consequently, several different strategies including polyethylene 
glycol modification and fusion with Fc or albumin have been developed and 
implemented to prolong the serum half-life of protein therapeutics. Here we will 
focus on the recent advances in the development of Fc-based antibody fragments 
and domains and their potential use as novel half-life-extending fusion partners 
for protein therapeutics.

Determinants of Change in the Cost-effectiveness Threshold.

The cost-effectiveness threshold in health care systems with a constrained 
budget should be determined by the cost-effectiveness of displacing health care 
services to fund new interventions. Using comparative statics, we review some 
potential determinants of the threshold, including the budget for health care, 
the demand for existing health care interventions, the technical efficiency of 
existing interventions, and the development of new health technologies. We 
consider the anticipated direction of impact that would affect the threshold 
following a change in each of these determinants. Where the health care system 
is technically efficient, an increase in the health care budget unambiguously 
raises the threshold, whereas an increase in the demand for existing, 
non-marginal health interventions unambiguously lowers the threshold. 
Improvements in the technical efficiency of existing interventions may raise or 
lower the threshold, depending on the cause of the improvement in efficiency, 
whether the intervention is already funded, and, if so, whether it is marginal. 
New technologies may also raise or lower the threshold, depending on whether the 
new technology is a substitute for an existing technology and, again, whether 
the existing technology is marginal. Our analysis permits health economists and 
decision makers to assess if and in what direction the threshold may change over 
time. This matters, as threshold changes impact the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions that require decisions now but have costs and effects that fall in 
future periods.

Metagenomic, microbial, chemical and sensory analyses of Thunnus albacares from 
Martinique stored in ice (AIR - 0 °C), vacuum (VP - 4/8 °C) and modified 
atmosphere packaging (MAP - 4/8 °C) (70% CO2 - 30% O2) were carried out. The 
organoleptic rejection of AIR tuna was observed at day 13 when total bacterial 
counts equaled 10(6)-10(7) CFU g(-1). No extension of shelf-life was provided by 
VP and MAP. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence analyzed by Illumina MiSeq and 
PCR-TTGE, Rhodanobacter terrae was the main species of the freshly caught tuna. 
At the sensory rejection time, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Pseudomonas 
dominated the AIR products while B. thermosphacta alone or a mix of 
B. thermosphacta, Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) dominated 
the microbiota of MAP and VP products, respectively. The pH value remained 
stable in all trials, ranging from 5.77 to 5.97. Total volatile basic nitrogen 
(TVBN) and trimethylamine (TMA-N) concentrations were weak and not significantly 
different between batches. Lipid oxidation increased in the samples containing 
O2 (MAP > AIR). The initial concentration of histamine was high 
(75-78 mg kg(-1)) and stable up to 8 days but then significantly decreased in 
all trials to reach 25-30 mg kg(-1), probably due to the presence of 
histamine-decomposing bacteria.

On standardized relative survival.

Sasieni P(1), Brentnall AR(1).

Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6BQ, U.K.

Cancer survival comparisons between cohorts are often assessed by estimates of 
relative or net survival. These measure the difference in mortality between 
those diagnosed with the disease and the general population. For such 
comparisons methods are needed to standardize cohort structure (including age at 
diagnosis) and all-cause mortality rates in the general population. Standardized 
non-parametric relative survival measures are evaluated by determining how well 
they (i) ensure the correct rank ordering, (ii) allow for differences in 
covariate distributions, and (iii) possess robustness and maximal estimation 
precision. Two relative survival families that subsume the Ederer-I, Ederer-II, 
and Pohar-Perme statistics are assessed. The aforementioned statistics do not 
meet our criteria, and are not invariant under a change of covariate 
distribution. Existing methods for standardization of these statistics are 
either not invariant to changes in the general population mortality or are not 
robust. Standardized statistics and estimators are developed to address the 
deficiencies. They use a reference distribution for covariates such as age, and 
a reference population mortality survival distribution that is recommended to 
approach zero with increasing age as fast as the cohort with the worst life 
expectancy. Estimators are compared using a breast-cancer survival example and 
computer simulation. The proposals are invariant and robust, and out-perform 
current methods to standardize the Ederer-II and Pohar-Perme estimators in 
simulations, particularly for extended follow-up.

Chronic psychosis, as for instance schizophrenia, usually begins in young 
adulthood and may cause severe disability. It causes a mean loss of life 
expectancy of 22 years. Actual models of psychosis do not trace the beginning of 
psychosis to the first franc psychotic episode only, but to earlier symptoms. In 
a classical health system only considering the first psychotic episode, the mean 
duration of untreated illness (DUI) can last several years. Yet this DUI has a 
direct impact on the prognosis of the disease. Actual international 
recommendations prescribe to early detect and treat at risk mental states of 
psychosis, thus reducing DUI. Such an attitude also helps the patient to 
integrate care in a moment where she/he is fully in condition to consent and to 
adhere. Generalist practitioners are crucial actors of early detection. We 
describe here simple and standardized tools helping early detection of high-risk 
mental states of psychosis in primary care and the appropriate attitude to do it 
properly. Numerous countries have developed early detection and treatment 
centers for psychosis. It has been established that such interventions clearly 
decrease the risk of transition towards chronic psychosis and improve the 
prognosis. These recent data about early detection and intervention in psychosis 
are a major step forward in psychiatry practice. It is now necessary to largely 
develop such actions in France.

'Social' egg freezing and the UK's statutory storage time limits.

Jackson E.

This article argues that the statutory time limits upon the storage of gametes 
have unintended and perhaps even perverse consequences for women freezing their 
eggs as insurance against age-related fertility decline. They work against good 
clinical practice and potentially represent an interference with a woman's right 
to respect for her family life, which is neither necessary nor proportionate. My 
claim will be that the statutory time limit, and the options for extension, are 
no longer fit for purpose.

Social Capital and Unretirement: Exploring the Bonding, Bridging, and Linking 
Aspects of Social Relationships.

Working longer is an important area of research given extended life expectancy, 
shortfalls of retirement income, desires to remain socially engaged, and 
solvency concerns of social insurance programs. The purpose of this longitudinal 
population-based study of older adults is to examine how different types of 
social resources (social bonding, bridging, and linking) relate to returning to 
work after retirement. Data were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study of 
fully retired older adults aged 62+ in 1998 ( N = 8,334) and followed to 2008. 
After controlling for a comprehensive set of fixed and time-varying covariates, 
findings suggest that social bridging (informal volunteering) and social linking 
(formal volunteering, partnered with an employed spouse) were strongly and 
positively related to returning to work (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.49, p < .001; HR: 
1.58, p < .0001; and HR: 1.75, p < .0001, respectively). Social bonding 
resources were not significantly associated with returning to work. Implications 
for social policy are discussed.

Data showing a remarkable gender difference in life expectancy and mortality, 
including survival to extreme age, are reviewed starting from clinical and 
demographic data and stressing the importance of a comprehensive historical 
perspective and a gene-environment/lifestyle interaction. Gender difference 
regarding prevalence and incidence of the most important age-related diseases, 
such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, 
disability, autoimmunity and infections, are reviewed and updated with 
particular attention to the role of the immune system and immunosenescence. On 
the whole, gender differences appear to be pervasive and still poorly considered 
and investigated despite their biomedical relevance. The basic biological 
mechanisms responsible for gender differences in aging and longevity are quite 
complex and still poorly understood. The present review focuses on centenarians 
and their offspring as a model of healthy aging and summarizes available 
knowledge on three basic biological phenomena, i.e. age-related X chromosome 
inactivation skewing, gut microbiome changes and maternally inherited 
mitochondrial DNA genetic variants. In conclusion, an appropriate 
gender-specific medicine approach is urgently needed and should be 
systematically pursued in studies on healthy aging, longevity and age-related 
diseases, in a globalized world characterized by great gender differences which 
have a high impact on health and diseases.

Individual recognition is considered to have been fundamental in the evolution 
of complex social systems and is thought to be a widespread ability throughout 
the animal kingdom. Although robust evidence for individual recognition remains 
limited, recent experimental paradigms that examine cross-modal processing have 
demonstrated individual recognition in a range of captive non-human animals. It 
is now highly relevant to test whether cross-modal individual recognition exists 
within wild populations and thus examine how it is employed during natural 
social interactions. We address this question by testing audio-visual 
cross-modal individual recognition in wild African lions (Panthera leo) using an 
expectancy-violation paradigm. When presented with a scenario where the playback 
of a loud-call (roaring) broadcast from behind a visual block is incongruent 
with the conspecific previously seen there, subjects responded more strongly 
than during the congruent scenario where the call and individual matched. These 
findings suggest that lions are capable of audio-visual cross-modal individual 
recognition and provide a useful method for studying this ability in wild 
populations.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) increases the risk of lower extremity 
amputation. It is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular ischemic events, affecting both the quality and expectancy of 
life. Many studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of PAD in patients with 
diabetes mellitus (DM) is higher than in non-diabetic patients. In diabetic 
patients, PAD occurs early with rapid progression, and is frequently 
asymptomatic. Multiple metabolic aberrations in DM, such as advanced glycation 
end-products, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and abnormal oxidative 
stress, have been shown to worsen PAD. However, the role of DM in PAD is not 
completely understood. The purpose of the present article is to review and 
discuss the pathophysiology of PAD in DM.

BACKGROUND: People suffering from neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) and an 
ineffective bowel regimen often suffer from fecal incontinence (FI) and related 
symptoms, which have a huge impact on their quality of life. In these 
situations, transanal irrigation (TAI) has been shown to reduce these symptoms 
and improve quality of life.
AIM: To investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of initiating TAI in 
patients with NBD who have failed standard bowel care (SBC).
METHODS: A deterministic Markov decision model was developed to project the 
lifetime health economic outcomes, including quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), episodes of FI, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and stoma surgery when 
initiating TAI relative to continuing SBC. A data set consisting of 227 patients 
with NBD due to spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis, spina bifida and 
cauda equina syndrome was used in the analysis. In the model a 30-year old 
individual with SCI was used as a base-case. A probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was applied to evaluate the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The model predicts that a 30-year old SCI patient with a life 
expectancy of 37 years initiating TAI will experience a 36% reduction in FI 
episodes, a 29% reduction in UTIs, a 35% reduction in likelihood of stoma 
surgery and a 0.4 improvement in QALYs, compared with patients continuing SBC. A 
lifetime cost-saving of £21,768 per patient was estimated for TAI versus 
continuing SBC alone.
CONCLUSION: TAI is a cost-saving treatment strategy reducing risk of stoma 
surgery, UTIs, episodes of FI and improving QALYs for NBD patients who have 
failed SBC.

Acute kidney injury is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality in the 
ageing population. Proteotoxic stress response pathways have been suggested to 
contribute to the development of acute renal injury. Recent evidence suggests 
that increased synthesis of N-glycan precursors in the hexosamine pathway as 
well as feeding of animals with aminosugars produced in the hexosamine pathway 
may increase stress resistance through reducing proteotoxic stress and alleviate 
pathology in model organisms. As feeding of the hexosamine pathway metabolite 
glucosamine to aged mice increased their life expectancy we tested whether 
supplementation of this aminosugar may also protect mice from acute kidney 
injury after renal ischemia and reperfusion. Animals were fed for 4 weeks ad 
libitum with standard chow or standard chow supplemented with 0.5% 
N-acetylglucosamine. Preconditioning with caloric restriction for four weeks 
prior to surgery served as a positive control for protective dietary effects. 
Whereas caloric restriction demonstrated the known protective effect both on 
renal function as well as survival in the treated animals, glucosamine 
supplementation failed to promote any protection from ischemia-reperfusion 
injury. These data show that although hexosamine pathway metabolites have a 
proven role in enhancing protein quality control and survival in model organisms 
oral glucosamine supplementation at moderate doses that would be amenable to 
humans does not promote protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury of the 
kidney.

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Increased life expectancy among people with Down syndrome 
(DS) has introduced new environmental factors that may affect blood pressure 
(BP) and/or lead to obesity in this population. The aim here was to investigate 
BP levels and body mass index (BMI) in adults with DS, correlating these data 
with the patients' sex and age.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Analytical cross-sectional observational study conducted in 
special schools in Curitiba (PR), Brazil.
METHODS: 97 adult patients were included. BP was measured in accordance with the 
established guidelines. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight by the height 
squared (kg/m2).
RESULTS: Sex had no influence on BMI; nor did systolic BP (SBP) or diastolic BP 
(DBP). The age range was from 18 to 56 years. No correlation was observed 
between increasing age and greater BMI or BP. Eighty-six individuals (88.7%) 
presented normal BP, eleven (11.3%) prehypertension and none hypertension. 
Twenty patients (20.4%) presented BP lower than 90 × 60 mmHg. BMI ranged from 18 
to 48 kg/m2 (mean of 28.8 ± 3.92 kg/m2): 21.9% had normal weight; 40.7% were 
overweight; and 25.3% had obesity class I, 9.9% class II and 2.2% class III. 
Higher BMI was associated with significantly greater SBP and DBP (P = 0.0175 and 
P = 0.0015).
CONCLUSION: Sex and age did not influence SBP, DBP or BMI in Brazilian adults 
with DS. Higher BMI was associated with greater BP (both systolic and 
diastolic).

BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled pilot studies have suggested the efficacy of focused 
ultrasound thalamotomy with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance for the 
treatment of essential tremor.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe essential tremor that had 
not responded to at least two trials of medical therapy and randomly assigned 
them in a 3:1 ratio to undergo unilateral focused ultrasound thalamotomy or a 
sham procedure. The Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor and the Quality of Life in 
Essential Tremor Questionnaire were administered at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 
12 months. Tremor assessments were videotaped and rated by an independent group 
of neurologists who were unaware of the treatment assignments. The primary 
outcome was the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 3 months 
in hand tremor, rated on a 32-point scale (with higher scores indicating more 
severe tremor). After 3 months, patients in the sham-procedure group could cross 
over to active treatment (the open-label extension cohort).
RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were included in the analysis. Hand-tremor scores 
improved more after focused ultrasound thalamotomy (from 18.1 points at baseline 
to 9.6 at 3 months) than after the sham procedure (from 16.0 to 15.8 points); 
the between-group difference in the mean change was 8.3 points (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 5.9 to 10.7; P<0.001). The improvement in the thalamotomy group 
was maintained at 12 months (change from baseline, 7.2 points; 95% CI, 6.1 to 
8.3). Secondary outcome measures assessing disability and quality of life also 
improved with active treatment (the blinded thalamotomy cohort)as compared with 
the sham procedure (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Adverse events in the 
thalamotomy group included gait disturbance in 36% of patients and paresthesias 
or numbness in 38%; these adverse events persisted at 12 months in 9% and 14% of 
patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy reduced hand tremor in 
patients with essential tremor. Side effects included sensory and gait 
disturbances. (Funded by InSightec and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number,

The burden of disease of cancer in the Mexican Social Security Institute.

González-León M, Fernández-Gárate JE, Rascón-Pacheco RA, Valladares-Aranda MÁ, 
Dávila-Torres J, Borja-Aburto VH.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the disease burden of cancer in the affiliate population 
of the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, 
IMSS) in 2010 by delegation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years of Life 
Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability/Disease 
(YLD) for 21 specific cancers and a subgroup of other malignant neoplasms were 
calculated based on the methodology of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 
for each of the 35 delegations of the IMSS.
RESULTS: In 2010, cancer represented the fifth overall leading cause of disease 
burden in IMSS affiliates (16.72 DALYs/1000 affiliates). A total of 75% of the 
cancer disease burden in each delegation is due to ten specific cancers, 
particularly breast cancer, which ranks first in 82% of the delegations. 
Prostate cancer; tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancers; leukemia, and colorectal 
and stomach cancers occupy the second to fourth positions in each delegation. 
With the exception of breast and prostate cancer, for which the contribution of 
YLD to the DALYs was higher than 50%, the greatest contribution to the DALYs of 
the other cancers was premature mortality, which accounted for more than 90% of 
the DALYs in some cases.
CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study allow for the identification of 
intervention priorities with regard to cancer at the institutional level and 
also for the focus at the delegation level to be placed on cancers ranking in 
the top positions for disease burden.

Estimating the indirect costs associated with the expected number of cancer 
cases in Mexico by 2020.

Gutiérrez-Delgado C, Armas-Texta D, Reynoso-Noverón N, Meneses-García A, 
Mohar-Betancourt A.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the indirect costs generated by adults with cancer in 
Mexico from 2002-2020.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using information from national sources and the national 
cancer incidence from GLOBOCAN, we estimated income lost due to premature death 
(ILPD), short-term benefits (STBs), disability pensions (DPs), and opportunity 
costs for the carer (OCCs) generated by patients with cancer. Amounts were 
reported in Mexican pesos.
RESULTS: We estimated 23 359 deaths and 216 679 new cases of cancer by 2020, 
which would be associated with a total indirect cost of 20.15 billion Mexican 
pesos. Men are expected to generate 54.9% of these costs. ILPD is expected to 
comprise the highest percentage of the cost (60%), followed by OCCs (22%), STBs 
(17%) and DPs (1%).
CONCLUSIONS: From an economic perspective, the results emphasize the need to 
strengthen preventive interventions and early detection of cancer among adults 
to reduce its effect on the productivity of Mexico.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic etiology of a distinct leukoencephalopathy 
with autosomal recessive inheritance in a single family.
METHODS: We analyzed available MRIs and retrospectively reviewed clinical 
information and laboratory investigations. We performed whole-exome sequencing 
to find the causal gene variants.
RESULTS: We identified 3 family members with a similar MRI pattern characterized 
by symmetrical signal abnormalities in the periventricular and deep cerebral 
white matter, thalami, and central part of the pons. Cerebellar atrophy was 
noted in advanced disease stages. Clinical features were childhood-onset slowly 
progressive spastic paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and 
in 2 patients, optic atrophy as well as vertical gaze and convergence palsies 
and nystagmus. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous missense 
variants in the HMBS gene, both associated with the autosomal dominant disorder 
acute intermittent porphyria. Sanger sequencing of 6 healthy siblings confirmed 
the bi-allelic location of the variants and segregation with the disease. 
Patients had a slight and moderate increase in urinary and plasma 
porphobilinogen and 5'-aminolevulinic acid, respectively, and a 50% to 66% 
decrease in hydroxymethylbilane synthase enzyme activity compared to normal.
CONCLUSIONS: Bi-allelic HMBS variants have been reported before as cause of 
severe encephalopathy with early childhood fatality in acute intermittent 
porphyria. Our cases demonstrate childhood onset, but milder and slower disease 
progression in middle-aged patients. With this, a novel phenotype can be added 
to the disease spectrum associated with bi-allelic HMBS variants: a 
leukoencephalopathy with early onset, slowly progressive neurologic 
symptomatology, and long life expectancy.

Previous research has shown an exaggeration in exercise hyperpnea 2 days after 
eccentric exercise (ECC). Enhancement in central command has been suggested as 
one candidate to account for this effect given that ECC-induced neuromuscular 
dysfunction increases relative exercise intensity, thus resulting in 
reinforcement of effort sense. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to 
elucidate whether the degree of alteration in effort sense caused by ECC affects 
exercise hyperpnea. Ten subjects performed 20-s single-arm extension-flexion 
exercises with weight strapped to the wrist, and ventilatory response was 
measured before (Pre) and 2 days after ECC (D2). Relative exercise intensity at 
Pre was 5 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of Pre, whereas that at D2 
was 9 % MVC of D2 because of decline in muscle strength. Ventilatory responses 
were significantly exaggerated at D2 with a significant increase in effort 
sense. Although effort sense was significantly reduced during exercise at D2 
when wrist weight was subtracted to match relative exercise intensity at Pre 
(5 % MVC of D2), ventilatory responses were still significantly higher than 
those of Pre. After the disappearance of post-ECC muscle damage, subjects 
performed the same exercise with weight added (9 % MVC of Pre) so that effort 
was equalized to match that of D2; however, no significant increase in 
ventilatory response was detected. The fact that the extent of change in effort 
sense caused by ECC-induced neuromuscular dysfunction did not affect ventilatory 
response at the onset of exercise after ECC may suggest that the exaggeration of 
ventilatory response after ECC is caused by mechanisms other than alteration of 
the central command.

BACKGROUND:  Substantial gaps remain in understanding the trade-offs between the 
costs and benefits of choosing alternative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
prevention strategies, including test-and-treat (expanded HIV testing combined 
with immediate treatment) and PrEP (initiation of preexposure prophylaxis by 
high-risk uninfected individuals) strategies.
METHODS:  We develop a mathematical epidemiological model to simulate HIV 
incidence among men residing in Los Angeles County, California, aged 15-65 
years, who have sex with men. We combine these incidence data with an economic 
model to estimate the discounted cost, effectiveness (quality-adjusted 
life-years [QALYs]), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of various HIV 
prevention strategies using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS:  PrEP and test-and-treat yield the largest reductions in HIV incidence, 
and are highly cost-effective ($27 863/QALY and $19 302/QALY, respectively) 
relative to status quo and at a US willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000/QALY 
saved. Status quo and 12 test-and-treat and PrEP strategies determine the 
frontier for efficient decisions. More aggressive strategies are costlier, but 
more effective, albeit with diminishing returns. The relative effectiveness of 
PrEP is sensitive to the initial HIV prevalence rate, PrEP and antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) adherence and initiation rates, the probabilities of HIV 
transmission, and the rates of sexual partner mixing.
CONCLUSIONS:  PrEP and test-and-treat offer cost-effective alternatives to the 
status quo. The success of these strategies depends on ART and PrEP adherence 
and initiation rates. The lack of evidence on adherence behaviors toward PrEP, 
therefore, warrants further studies.

BACKGROUND: Screening and Brief Interventions for alcohol are an effective 
public health measure to tackle alcohol-related harm, however relatively few 
countries across the European Union (EU) have implemented them widely. This may 
be due to a lack of understanding of the specific financial implications of such 
policies within each country.
METHODS: A novel 'meta-modelling' approach was developed based on previous SBI 
cost-effectiveness models for four EU countries. Data were collected on the key
