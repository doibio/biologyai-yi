with the fibrillin-1 (Fbn1) gene mutation and characterized by cardiovascular 
alterations, predominantly ascending aortic aneurysms. Although neurovascular 
complications are uncommon in MFS, the improvement in Marfan patients' life 
expectancy is revealing other secondary alterations, potentially including 
neurovascular disorders. However, little is known about small-vessel 
pathophysiology in MFS. MFS is associated with hyperactivated transforming 
growth factor (TGF)-β signaling, which among numerous other downstream 
effectors, induces the NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) isoform of NADPH oxidase, a strong 
enzymatic source of H2O2 We hypothesized that MFS induces middle cerebral artery 
(MCA) alterations and that Nox4 contributes to them. MCA properties from 3-, 6-, 
or 9-mo-old Marfan (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) mice were compared with those from 
age/sex-matched wild-type littermates. At 6 mo, Marfan compared with wild-type 
mice developed higher MCA wall/lumen (wild-type: 0.081 ± 0.004; Marfan: 0.093 ± 
0.002; 60 mmHg; P < 0.05), coupled with increased reactive oxygen species 
production, TGF-β, and Nox4 expression. However, wall stiffness and myogenic 
autoregulation did not change. To investigate the influence of Nox4 on 
cerebrovascular properties, we generated Marfan mice with Nox4 deficiency 
(Nox4(-/-)). Strikingly, Nox4 deletion in Marfan mice aggravated MCA wall 
thickening (cross-sectional area; Marfan: 6,660 ± 363 μm(2); Marfan Nox4(-/-): 
8,795 ± 824 μm(2); 60 mmHg; P < 0.05), accompanied by decreased TGF-β expression 
and increased collagen deposition and Nox1 expression. These findings provide 
the first evidence that Nox4 mitigates cerebral artery structural changes in a 
murine model of MFS.

Patients with chronic heart failure who are not eligible for heart transplant 
and whose life expectancy depends mainly on the heart disease may benefit from 
mechanical circulatory support. Mechanical circulatory support restores adequate 
cardiac output and organ perfusion and eventually improves patients' clinical 
condition, quality of life and life expectancy. This treatment is called 
destination therapy (DT) and we estimate that in Switzerland more than 120 
patients per year could benefit from it. In the last 10 years, design of the 
devices, implantation techniques and prognoses have changed dramatically. The 
key to successful therapy with a left ventricular assist device is appropriate 
patient selection, although we are still working on the definition of reliable 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and optimal timing for surgical implantation. 
Devices providing best long-term results are continuous flow, rotary or axial 
blood pumps implanted using minimally invasive techniques on a beating heart. 
These new devices (Thoratec HeartMate II and HeartWare HVAD) have only a single 
moving part, and have improved durability with virtually 10 years freedom from 
mechanical failure. In selected patients, the overall actuarial survival of DT 
patients is 75% at 1 year and 62% at 2 years, with a clear improvement in 
quality of life compared with medical management only. Complications include 
bleeding and infections; their overall incidence is significantly lower than 
with previous devices and their management is well defined. DT is evolving into 
an effective and reasonably cost-effective treatment option for a growing 
population of patients not eligible for heart transplant, showing encouraging 
survival rates at 2 years and providing clear improvement in quality of life. 
The future is bright for people suffering from chronic heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Over 30 % of older patients experience hospitalization-associated 
disability (HAD) (i.e., loss of independence in Activities of Daily Living 
(ADLs)) after an acute hospitalization. Despite its high prevalence, the 
mechanisms that underlie HAD remain elusive. This paper describes the protocol 
for the Hospital-Associated Disability and impact on daily Life (Hospital-ADL) 
study, which aims to unravel the potential mechanisms behind HAD from admission 
to three months post-discharge.
METHODS/DESIGN: The Hospital-ADL study is a multicenter, observational, 
prospective cohort study aiming to recruit 400 patients aged ≥70 years that are 
acutely hospitalized at departments of Internal Medicine, Cardiology or 
Geriatrics, involving six hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligible are patients 
hospitalized for at least 48 h, without major cognitive impairment (Mini Mental 
State Examination score ≥15), who have a life expectancy of more than three 
months, and without disablement in all six ADLs. The study will assess possible 
cognitive, behavioral, psychosocial, physical, and biological factors of HAD. 
Data will be collected through: 1] medical and demographical data; 2] personal 
interviews, which includes assessment of cognitive impairment, behavioral and 
psychosocial functioning, physical functioning, and health care utilization; 3] 
physical performance tests, which includes gait speed, hand grip strength, 
balance, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and an activity tracker (Fitbit 
Flex), and; 4] analyses of blood samples to assess inflammatory and metabolic 
markers. The primary endpoint is additional disabilities in ADLs three months 
post-hospital discharge compared to ADL function two weeks prior to hospital 
admission. Secondary outcomes are health care utilization, health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL), physical performance tests, and mortality. There will 
be at least five data collection points; within 48 h after admission (H1), at 
discharge (H3), and at one (P1; home visit), two (P2; by telephone) and three 
months (P3; home visit) post-discharge. If the patient is admitted for more than 
five days, additional measurements will be planned during hospitalization on 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (H2).
DISCUSSION: The Hospital-ADL study will provide information on cognitive, 
behavioral, psychosocial, physical, and biological factors associated with HAD 
and will be collected during and following hospitalization. These data may 
inform new interventions to prevent or restore hospitalization-associated 
disability.

OBJECTIVES: To compare utilities for prenatal testing outcomes among women 
inclined to continue their pregnancy despite abnormal results versus those 
inclined to terminate and to analyze how differences affect optimal prenatal 
testing strategies.
METHOD: Time tradeoff utilities for 23 outcomes were elicited from 281 women. We 
compared utilities based on termination inclination and applied them to a 
decision-analytic framework.
RESULTS: Of participants, 46.6% indicated that they would 'definitely' or 
'probably' continue their pregnancy despite results indicating an intellectual 
disability. These women assigned higher utilities to abnormal testing results 
and having a child with an intellectual disability than women who would probably 
or definitely terminate. Primary cell-free DNA screening had the most 
quality-adjusted life years for women inclined to continue their pregnancy but 
yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1 685 449. Multiple 
marker screening with either cell-free DNA or diagnostic testing as follow-up 
had an ICER of $9037. Primary diagnostic testing resulted in the most 
quality-adjusted life years for women inclined to terminate, with an ICER of 
$111 776.
CONCLUSION: Women seeking testing vary in prenatal testing outcome preferences 
and termination inclinations in the context of results indicating an 
intellectual disability. How they envision utilizing prenatal testing 
information impacts their optimal testing strategy. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons,

The primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is a public health priority. To 
assess the costs and benefits of a Polypill Prevention Programme using a daily 
4-component polypill from age 50 in the UK, we determined the life years gained 
without a first myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, together with the total 
service cost (or saving) and the net cost (or saving) per year of life gained 
without a first MI or stroke. This was estimated on the basis of a 50 % uptake 
and a previously published 83 % treatment adherence. The total years of life 
gained without a first MI or stroke in a mature programme is 990,000 each year 
in the UK. If the cost of the Polypill Prevention Programme were £1 per person 
per day, the total cost would be £4.76 bn and, given the savings (at 2014 
prices) of £2.65 bn arising from the disease prevented, there would be a net 
cost of £2.11 bn representing a net cost per year of life gained without a first 
MI or stroke of £2120. The results are robust to sensitivity analyses. A 
national Polypill Prevention Programme would have a substantial effect in 
preventing MIs and strokes and be cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to clarify the cost-effectiveness of an expensive 
combination therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF) using both catheter ablation 
and dabigatran compared with warfarin at each CHADS2 score for patients in 
Japan.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to analyze costs and quality-adjusted 
life years associated with AF therapeutic options with a time horizon of 10 
years. The target population was 60-year-old patients with paroxysmal AF. The 
indication for anticoagulation was determined according to the Japanese 
guideline. Anticoagulation-related data were derived from the RE-LY study and 
the AF recurrence rate was set at 2.7% per month during the first 12 months and 
at 0.40% per month afterwards. Stroke risk was determined according to AF 
recurrence, anticoagulation, and CHADS2 score. The risks for stroke recurrence 
and stroke death were also considered. Costs were calculated from the healthcare 
payer's perspective, and only direct medical costs were included.
RESULTS: Warfarin was the most preferred option for patients with a CHADS2 score 
of 0 from a health economics aspect. Ablation under warfarin was preferred for a 
CHADS2 score of 1-3, while ablation under dabigatran was preferred for a CHADS2 
score ≥4. The quality of life score for AF had the largest impact on the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the analysis between the 
anticoagulation arm and the anticoagulation+ablation arm for a CHADS2 score of 
2. Within the range of the Japanese willingness-to-pay threshold (¥5,000,000), 
the ablation+warfarin arm became the best option with its probability of 81.7% 
for a CHADS2 score of 2; the dabigatran+ablation arm was the most preferred 
option with its probability of 56.1% for a CHADS2 score of 4.
CONCLUSIONS: Ablation under dabigatran therapy is an expensive therapeutic 
option, but it might benefit patients with a low quality of life and a high 
CHADS2 score.

INTRODUCTION: Information is limited on the cost effectiveness of strategies to 
improve depressive symptoms in patients with Type 2 diabetes in primary care 
outside of the U.S.
METHODS: Using patient data from a 12-month controlled implementation trial, 
outcomes and healthcare costs determined through administrative database 
linkages were compared for a strategy of family physician notification and 
follow-up ("enhanced care") versus collaborative care. Two measures of 
effectiveness were used: depression-free days (DFDs) based on Patient Health 
Questionnaire, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on EQ-5D. Data were 
collected November 2010 to January 2013 with analyses completed in May 2015. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were also compared against true usual care 
patients.
RESULTS: Among 227 patients, mean age was 58 years, 55% were female, and mean 
diabetes duration was 12 years. Compared with total 12-month cost per usual care 
patient (C$5,889), the incremental cost was C$450 for patients in enhanced care 
and C$1,021 for collaborative care. Both enhanced and collaborative care 
strategies improved outcomes compared with usual care, with incremental DFDs of 
65.9 and 117.6, and incremental QALYs of 0.006 and 0.042, respectively. Compared 
with enhanced care, collaborative care yielded incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios of C$11/DFD and C$15,861/QALY. Compared with usual care, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were C$7/DFD or C$76,271/QALY for enhanced care and 
C$9/DFD or C$24,368/QALY for collaborative care.
CONCLUSIONS: In primary care patients with Type 2 diabetes who screened positive 
for depression, physician notification and follow-up was a clinically effective 
strategy compared with usual care, but investing more resources in collaborative 
care yielded the most cost-effective strategy.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the cost 
effectiveness of current HIV prevention interventions in the U.S. using a 
consistent, standardized methodology.
METHODS: The cost effectiveness of common and emerging HIV biomedical and 
behavioral prevention interventions as delivered to men who have sex with men, 
injection drug users, and sexually active heterosexuals was estimated. Data on 
program costs, intervention efficacy, risk behaviors, and per contact 
transmission probabilities were collected from peer-reviewed papers and health 
department reports. These data were combined with 2010 national HIV incidence 
and prevalence surveillance data in a Bernoulli process model to estimate the 
reduced annual risk of HIV transmission or acquisition associated with these 
interventions. The cost per prevented case of HIV and the cost per saved 
quality-adjusted life year were then calculated. Analyses were conducted between 
2014 and 2015.
RESULTS: Interventions to diagnose HIV and provide ongoing care and treatment 
had the lowest cost per prevented case. Among interventions targeted at specific 
risk groups, interventions for men who have sex with men were the most cost 
effective. The least cost-effective interventions typically addressed people at 
risk of acquiring HIV rather than those at risk of transmitting the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention interventions targeted at high-risk populations, 
those associated with the care continuum, and those that reduce the transmission 
risk of HIV-infected people are typically the most cost effective. Decision 
makers can consider these results in planning an efficient allocation of HIV 
prevention resources.

Palliative ICU beds for potential organ donors: an effective use of resources 
based on quality-adjusted life-years gained.

Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the admission of a palliative patient to the 
intensive care unit for end-of-life care and consideration of organ donation 
provides an equivalent net benefit in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
compared with the admission of a non-palliative patient for active management.
DESIGN: Relevant publications from the period 1995-2015 were reviewed to 
estimate the mean QALYs gained from ICU admission of a critically ill patient 
and mean QALYs gained from transplantation of solid organs from an organ donor. 
Australian audit data were used to estimate the likelihood of a palliative 
patient admitted to the ICU progressing to organ donation. We calculated 
probabilities of each outcome and developed an algorithm to illustrate possible 
pathways for a patient who may progress to organ donation.
RESULTS: A non-palliative ICU admission provides to the patient about 1.0 QALY 
per ICU bed-day. An ICU bed provided to a patient admitted to the ICU for 
palliation and consideration of organ donation results in 7.3 QALYs gained for 
the community per ICU bed-day.
CONCLUSION: The admission of a dying patient to the ICU when organ donation may 
be possible is of considerable community benefit, yielding an average of over 
seven times the QALYs per ICU bed-day compared with the average benefit for ICU 
patients expected to survive. When it is possible to offer end-of-life care in 
the ICU, it should not be denied on the basis of concerns about lack of benefit 
or inappropriate use of resources.

Kudoa rayformis n. sp. (Myxozoa; Multivalvulida) was observed in the trunk 
muscle of Pacific sierra Scomberomorus sierra caught off the coast of Tonosi, 
Panama. The species formed pseudocysts in myofibers and infection was 
subclinical. The myxospores possessed four polar capsules and spore valves, one 
of which had a distinct filamentous extension. This unique morphological 
characteristic of the myxospore validated this as a new species of Kudoa. 
Genetically, K. rayformis n. sp. is closest to K. inornata, with 98% and 91% 
similarity in 18S and 28S rDNA, respectively, but its spore shape was clearly 
distinct. The 18S rDNA and concatenated sequences from K. rayformis were used in 
molecular phylogenetic analyses of kudoids to examine the congruence of 
phylogeny with infection site tropism, spore morphology and cyst/pseudocyst 
formation. The results demonstrated that the phenotypic traits were correlated 
with the phylogeny of Kudoidae, and that the biological features of K. rayformis 
originated from the ancient Kudoidae as exhibited by the non-specific infection 
site tropism and the ability to infect muscle and form pseudocysts.

Relationship of Having Hobbies and a Purpose in Life With Mortality, Activities 
of Daily Living, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Among 
Community-Dwelling Elderly Adults.

BACKGROUND: This study's aim was to clarify the relationship of having hobbies 
and a purpose in life (PIL; in Japanese, ikigai) with mortality and a decline in 
the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) among the 
community-dwelling elderly.
METHODS: Prospective observational data from residents aged ≥65 years who were 
at increased risk for death (n = 1853) and developing a decline in ADL (n = 
1254) and IADL (n = 1162) were analyzed. Cox proportional hazard models were 
used for mortality analysis of data from February 2011 to November 2014. ADL and 
IADL were evaluated using the Barthel Index and the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute 
of Gerontology Index of Competence, respectively. ADL and IADL were assessed at 
baseline and follow-up and were evaluated using logistic regression models. 
Fully adjusted models included terms for age, gender, BMI, income, alcohol 
intake, smoking history, number of chronic diseases, cognitive function, and 
depression.
RESULTS: During the follow-up of eligible participants, 248 had died, 119 saw a 
decline in ADL, and 178 saw a decline in IADL. In fully adjusted models, having 
neither hobbies nor PIL was significantly associated with an increased risk of 
mortality (hazard ratio 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.94), decline 
in ADL (odds ratio 2.74; 95% CI, 1.44-5.21), and decline in IADL (odds ratio 
1.89; 95% CI, 1.01-3.55) compared to having both hobbies and PIL.
CONCLUSIONS: Although effect modifications by cognitive functioning and 
depression cannot be ruled out, our findings suggest that having hobbies and PIL 
may extend not only longevity, but also healthy life expectancy among 
community-dwelling older adults.

Objective Peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg, administered subcutaneously (SC) every 
2 weeks, a new disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014. 
This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon beta-1a vs 
interferon beta-1a (44 mcg SC 3 times per week) and glatiramer acetate (20 mg SC 
once-daily) in the treatment of RRMS from the perspective of a US payer over 10 
years. Methods A Markov cohort economic model was developed for this analysis. 
The model predicts disability progression, occurrence of relapses and other 
adverse events and translates them into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
costs. Natural history data were obtained from the placebo arm of the ADVANCE 
trial of peginterferon beta-1a, the London Ontario (Canada) database and a large 
population-based MS survey. Comparative efficacy of each DMT vs placebo was 
obtained from a network meta-analysis. Costs (in 2014 US dollars) were sourced 
from public databases and literature. Clinical and economic outcomes were 
discounted at 3% per year. Results Over 10 years, peginterferon beta-1a was 
dominant (i.e., more effective and less costly), with cost-savings of $22,070 
and additional 0.06 QALYs when compared with interferon beta-1a 44 mcg and with 
cost-savings of $19,163 and 0.07 QALYs gained when compared with glatiramer 
acetate 20 mg. Results were most sensitive to variations in the treatment effect 
of each DMT, treatment acquisition costs of each DMT and the time horizon. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that peginterferon beta-1a remains 
dominant in >90% of 5,000 replications compared with either DMTs. Conclusion 
This analysis suggests that long-term treatment with peginterferon beta-1a 
improves clinical outcomes at reduced costs compared with interferon beta-1a 
44 mcg and glatiramer acetate 20 mg and should be a valuable addition to managed 
care formularies for treating patients with RRMS.

Effects of chitosan combined with different concentrations of nisin on quality 
enhancement of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) stored at 4 °C were 
evaluated for 8 days. Changes in sensory score and volatile spoilage products, 
total viable counts (TVC), and physiochemical indexes including weight loss, 
colour, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), and K-value were examined. 
Results demonstrated that nisin-treated samples presented better quality 
preservation effects than chitosan alone. 1% chitosan combined with 0.6% nisin 
presented optimal quality enhancement effects, such as moisture loss control, 
volatile spoilage inhibition, TVB-N reduction, TVC growth control, and colour 
and sensory acceptability maintenance. Therefore, chitosan combined with nisin 
is promising in large yellow croaker shelf life extension.

Purple rice is a strain of glutaneous rice rich in anthocyanins and γ-oryzanol. 
Both types of compounds are involved in antioxidant and lipid metabolism of 
mammals. Three experimental diet types were used which consisted approximately 
by half either of purple rice, white rice or corn. Diets were fed to 3×10 pigs 
growing from about 30 to 100 kg. Meat samples were investigated either as raw or 
cured loin chops or as smoked bacon produced from the belly. Various 
physicochemical traits were assessed and data were evaluated by analysis of 
variance. Traits describing water-holding capacity (drip, thaw, and cooking 
losses) and tenderness (sensory grading, shear force) of the meat were mostly 
not significantly affected by the diet type. However, purple rice feeding of 
pigs resulted in lower fat and cholesterol contents of loin and smoked bacon 
compared to white rice, but not compared to corn feeding except of the fat 
content of the loin. The shelf life of the raw loin chops was improved by purple 
rice as well. In detail, the occurrence of thiobarbituric acid reactive 
substances after 9 days of chilled storage was three to four times higher in the 
white rice and corn diets than with purple rice. The n-6:n-3 ratio in the raw 
loin chops was 9:1 with purple rice and clearly higher with 12:1 with the other 
diets, meat lipids. Level and kind of effect of purple rice found in raw meat 
was not always recovered in the cured loin chops and the smoked bacon. Still the 
impression of flavor and color, as well as overall acceptability were best in 
the smoked bacon from the purple-rice fed pigs, whereas this effect did not 
occur in the cured loin chops. These findings suggest that purple rice has a 
certain, useful, bioactivity in pigs concerning meat quality, but some of these 
effects are of low practical relevance. Further studies have to show ways how 
transiency and low recovery in meat products of some of the effects can be 
counteracted.

BACKGROUND: It is unknown if survival prediction tools (SPTs) sufficiently 
predict survival in patients who undergo palliative reirradiation of spinal 
metastases. We therefore set out to clarify if SPTs can predict survival in this 
patient population.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed spinal reirradiations performed (n = 58, 52 
patients, 44 included in analysis). SPTs for patients with spinal metastases 
were identified and compared to a general palliative score and to a dedicated 
SPT to estimate prognosis in palliative reirradiation independent of site 
(SPT-Nieder).
RESULTS: Consistently in all tests, SPT-Nieder showed best predictive 
performance as compared to other tools. Items associated with survival were 
general condition (KPS), liver metastases, and steroid use. Other factors like 
primary tumor site, pleural effusion, and bone metastases were not correlated 
with survival. We adapted an own score to the data which performed comparable to 
SPT-Nieder but avoids the pleural effusion item. Both scores showed good 
performance in identifying long-term survivors with late recurrences.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival prediction in case of spinal reirradiation is possible 
with sufficient predictive separation. Applying SPTs in case of reirradiation 
helps to identify patients with good life expectancy who might benefit from dose 
escalation or longer treatment courses.

The development, reproduction, and life table parameters of the Phenacoccus 
madeirensis Green (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) on four ornamental plant species, 
namely Pelargonium zonale (Geraniaceae), Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Hibicus 
syriacus (Malvaceae), and Cestrum nocturnum (Solanaceae) were investigated under 
controlled conditions (25 ± 2°C, 60 ± 10% R.H., and 16 h photophase). Life table 
data were analyzed by using an age-stage two-sex life table. The shortest total 
immature developmental time of females and males for P. madeirensis was obtained 
on C. nocturnum (20.42 and 21.90 days, respectively). The highest fecundities 
were 233 and 232 eggs on C. nocturnum and H. syriacus, respectively. The 
intrinsic rate of increase (r  = 0.1511 day(-1)) and finite rate of increase 
(λ  =  1.1631 day(-1)) were the greatest when mealybugs were reared on C. 
nocturnum. Net reproductive rate (R 0  =  129.5 offspring) was the greatest when 
reared on H. syriacus, but this value was not statistically different from that 
on C. nocturnum. The shortest mean generation time (T  =  31.3 days) was 
calculated on C. nocturnum. These results indicate that C. nocturnum and H. 
syriacus are more suitable hosts than H. rosa-sinensis and P. zonale for P. 
madeirensis.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of marked clinical 
heterogeneity, and while some patients have a normal life expectancy, others 
develop rapidly progressive disease shortly after diagnosis. The current 
standard for upfront treatment of CLL is chemoimmunotherapy for younger fit 
patients, FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) being the 
prototype. For older patients, BR (bendamustine and rituximab) exhibits 
excellent activity with decreased toxicity. For the frailest patients, CD20 
monoclonal antibodies with or without chlorambucil have proven to be 
efficacious. The novel oral kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib are 
FDA-approved in the relapsed/refractory setting, and ibrutinib is approved 
upfront for those with del(17p). These drugs have produced long-term durable 
responses in the relapsed/refractory setting, and studies are underway using 
these as single agent upfront or in combination with both chemotherapy and 
monoclonal antibodies. Here, we review standard upfront therapies and new agents 
and combinations that are on the horizon for CLL.

Recognizing the economic and health-outcome value of early cognitive assessment 
and intervention among its older citizens has guided the Innovative Research 
School in Gerontology of the SD Asfendiyarov Kazakh National Medical University 
to begin the process of establishing its nation's first memory center in Almaty, 
Kazakhstan. Life expectancy in Kazakhstan, which continues to undergo 
health-care reform since its independence in 1991 from the former Soviet Union, 
has steadily risen from 64.4 years in 1996 to 68.67 in 2009. With increased life 
expectancy has been a corresponding rise in cognitive impairments among older 
adults. The components of the Memory Center, which comprises assessment, 
education and support, non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions, are 
described.

PURPOSE: Dramatically improved health care in recent years has increased the 
life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) as well as the 
prognosis for its ocular complications. We sought to identify risk factors for 
visual impairment in patients with SCD in London 4 decades after Goldberg's 
seminal studies.
METHODS: Patients 16 years and older with SCD (genotypes HbSS, HbSC, 
HbSβ-thalassemia) attending hematology and ophthalmology services were offered 
ocular examination. Retinopathy was graded according to the Goldberg 
classification. Visual impairment was defined as corrected distance visual 
acuity of 20/40 or poorer.
RESULTS: In total, 182 eyes of 182 patients (mean ± SD age, 37.2 ± 12.8 years; 
female, 65.9%) were included. Women were significantly older than men (mean ± SD 
age, 38.8 ± 13.1 vs 34.2 ± 11.8 years; p = 0.0174). There was no difference in 
mean age of each genotype group (p&gt;0.15). Risk factors for sight-threatening 
proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) were age over 35 years (odds ratio [OR] 
2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.89; p = 0.0359) and HbSC genotype (OR 
4.06; 95% CI 2.07-7.98; p&lt;0.0001). Although visual impairment was related to 
the presence of sight-threatening PSR (OR 7.23; 95% CI 1.50-35.0; p = 0.0138), 
it was not related to hemoglobin genotype (p&gt;0.50).
CONCLUSIONS: We present the largest study of ocular findings in SCD in the 
United Kingdom. Sight-threatening PSR is a risk factor for visual impairment, 
but hemoglobin genotype status is not.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer represents a fatal malignancy leading to premature 
death and loss of life expectancy. The aim of the present study was to assess 
how many years of life are lost due to this cancer, in relationship with surgery 
and ageing.
METHODS: Data from 716 consecutive patients discharged from a tertiary referral 
hospital (2002-2012) with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and with complete 
clinical and follow-up data were used to estimate the number of years of 
life-lost (YLL) through a semi-parametric extrapolation having an age-, sex- and 
year-of-onset- matched population derived from national life tables as 
reference.
RESULTS: The mean entire lifespan estimated for the 716 patients was 1.4 years 
(95% C.I.:0.8-1.9) resulting in a number of YLL after diagnosis of 12 years (95% 
C.I.:11.5-12.6) per person. Surgical patients (147 cases; 20.5%) were younger 
and experienced higher post-diagnostic lifespan (3.5 years) than non-surgical 
older individuals (0.8 years; p < 0.001). These figures were reflected on the 
number of expected YLL (EYLL) that remained substantially unaffected by surgery 
(p = 0.821). Patients aged ≤68 years experienced the highest number of EYLL 
(20.8 years); whereas elderly patients had a loss of life that corresponded to 
only 6% of the entire life they had already lived.
CONCLUSIONS: In a typical pancreatic cancer cohort, surgery was not able to 
modify population-based statistics because of a different age at tumor onset 
which nullifies any benefit from a "lifespan from birth" perspective. Pancreatic 
cancer in younger individuals must be ranked within the very first causes of 
EYLL due to malignancy.

PURPOSE: Elderly chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are one of the fastest 
growing groups in hemodialysis (HD). However, overall mortality and 
arteriovenous fistulae failure are still high in this population. Therefore, a 
different vascular access policy may be advised for this group of patients.
METHODS: We searched PubMed for relevant articles published in English between 
the years 2000-2015. Studies investigating vascular access-related outcomes in 
elderly CKD patients were included.
RESULTS: The scarce literature on this topic suggests that elderly CKD patients 
are more likely to undergo unnecessary vascular access procedures. However, with 
appropriate vascular evaluation, arteriovenous access placement is a viable 
strategy for this group of patients and dialysis access-related outcomes are 
superior for arteriovenous access in comparison with dialysis catheters.
CONCLUSIONS: When deciding whether or not to create an arteriovenous vascular 
access in elderly CKD patients, physicians should consider the probability of 
CKD progression, the expected life expectancy and quality of life of the patient 
and the probability of success of an arteriovenous access creation.

Clinical applications of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand (hTRAIL) have been limited by their poor 
pharmacokinetics. Using endogenous albumin as a carrier is an attractive 
approach for circulatory half-life extension. Here, we produced ABD-hTRAIL and 
hTRAIL-ABD by fusing the albumin-binding domain (ABD) from protein G to the N- 
or C-terminus of hTRAIL. We found that ABD-hTRAIL bound human serum albumin 
(HSA) with a high affinity (0.4 ± 0.18 nM) and formed nanoparticles with an 
average diameter (~12 nm) above the threshold (~7 nm) of renal filtration. 
ABD-hTRAIL also bound mouse serum albumin (MSA); thus, its half-life was 
40-50-fold greater than that of hTRAIL (14.1 ± 0.87 h vs 0.32 ± 0.14 h). Tumor 
uptake of ABD-hTRAIL 8-48 h post-injection was 6-16-fold that of hTRAIL. 
Consequently, the tumor suppression of ABD-hTRAIL in mice bearing subcutaneous 
xenografts was 3-4 times greater than that of hTRAIL. Additionally, the time 
period during which ABD-hTRAIL could kill circulating tumor cells was 
approximately 8 times longer than that of hTRAIL. These results demonstrate that 
ABD fused to the N-terminus endows hTRAIL with albumin binding ability; once it 
enters the vasculature, ABD mediates binding with endogenous albumin, thus 
prolonging the half-life and enhancing the antitumor effect of hTRAIL. However, 
hTRAIL-ABD did not show a high affinity for albumin and therefore did not 
display the prolonged circulatory half-life and enhanced antitumor effects. 
These results demonstrate that N-terminal, but not C-terminal, ABD-fusion is an 
efficient technique for enhancing the antitumor effects of hTRAIL by using 
endogenous albumin as a carrier.
