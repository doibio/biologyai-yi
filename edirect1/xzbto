Two papers in this issue of Diabetologia present recent trends in life 
expectancy for people with type 1 diabetes, one using data from an Australian 
registry (Huo et al, DOI: 10.1007/s00125-015-3857-4 ), the other, a Swedish 
registry (Petrie et al, DOI: 10.1007/s00125-016-3914-7 ). This commentary 
provides a brief review of the concept of the period life expectancy and 
complexities regarding applicability to patients, before summarising and 
discussing the main results of the two papers. In addition, some remaining 
relevant knowledge gaps are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: Obesity prevalence among Americans has increased for nearly three 
decades. We explore the relationship between the rise in obesity and Social 
Security retirement benefit claiming, a decision impacting nearly all aging 
Americans. Specifically, we investigate whether obesity can affect individuals' 
decision to claim benefits early, a choice that has important implications for 
financial security in retirement, particularly for those with lower 
socioeconomic status (SES).
METHOD: We use a microsimulation model called MINT6 (Modeling Income in the Near 
Term, version 6) to demonstrate the potential effects of obesity on subjective 
life expectancy and claiming behavior. We impute obesity status using data from 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which describes 
the distribution of obesity prevalence within the United States by gender, 
poverty status, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: We find that the rise in obesity and the consequent incidence of 
obesity-related diseases may lead some individuals to make claiming decisions 
that lead to lower monthly and lifetime Social Security retirement benefits. 
Further, we find that the potential economic impact of this decision is larger 
for those with lower SES.
DISCUSSION: We present a behavioral perspective by addressing the potential 
effects that obesity can have on individuals' retirement decisions and their 
resulting Social Security retirement benefits.

Studies of the effects of mass extinctions on ancient ecosystems have focused on 
changes in taxic diversity, morphological disparity, abundance, behaviour and 
resource availability as key determinants of group survival. Crucially, the 
contribution of life history traits to survival during terrestrial mass 
extinctions has not been investigated, despite the critical role of such traits 
for population viability. We use bone microstructure and body size data to 
investigate the palaeoecological implications of changes in life history 
strategies in the therapsid forerunners of mammals before and after the 
Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME), the most catastrophic crisis in 
Phanerozoic history. Our results are consistent with truncated development, 
shortened life expectancies, elevated mortality rates and higher extinction 
risks amongst post-extinction species. Various simulations of ecological 
dynamics indicate that an earlier onset of reproduction leading to shortened 
generation times could explain the persistence of therapsids in the 
unpredictable, resource-limited Early Triassic environments, and help explain 
observed body size distributions of some disaster taxa (e.g., Lystrosaurus). Our 
study accounts for differential survival in mammal ancestors after the PTME and 
provides a methodological framework for quantifying survival strategies in other 
vertebrates during major biotic crises.

As the population ages and incidence of basal cell carcinoma continues to 
increase, we will be faced more frequently with difficult treatment decisions 
for basal cell carcinoma in the elderly. Different treatment options, including 
surgical excision, electrodessication and curettage, cryosurgery, imiquimod, 
photodynamic therapy, 5-fluorouracil, radiation therapy, vismodegib, combination 
therapy, and observation, may be considered on the basis of tumor 
characteristics. Given the wide range of therapeutic options, treatments can be 
tailored to achieve patients' goals of care within their anticipated life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of neurothrombectomy with a stent 
retriever (Solitaire * Revascularization Device) in treating acute ischemic 
stroke patients from the UK healthcare provider perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate health outcomes and costs of 
two therapies over a lifetime time horizon: stent-retriever thrombectomy in 
combination with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV t-PA), and IV 
t-PA alone. The model incorporated an acute phase (0-90 days) and a rest of life 
phase (90+ days). Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale score. 
During the rest of life phase, patients remained in the same health state until 
a recurrent stroke or death. Clinical effectiveness and safety data were taken 
from the SWIFT PRIME study. Resource use and health state utilities were 
informed by published data.
RESULTS: Combined stent-retriever thrombectomy and IV t-PA led to improved 
quality-of-life and increased life expectancy compared to IV t-PA alone. The 
higher treatment costs associated with the use of stent-retriever thrombectomy 
were offset by long-term cost savings due to improved patient health status, 
leading to overall cost savings of £33 190 per patient and a net benefit of £79 
402. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the 
results were robust to a wide range of parameter inputs.
LIMITATIONS: The acute and long-term costs resource use data were taken from a 
study based on a patient population that was older and may have had additional 
comorbidities than the SWIFT PRIME population, resulting in costs that may not 
be representative of the cohort within this model. In addition, the estimates 
may not reflect stroke care today as no current evidence is available; however, 
the cost estimates were deemed reasonable by clinical opinion.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined stent-retriever neurothrombectomy and IV t-PA is a 
cost-effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke compared with IV t-PA alone.

This paper describes a simulation framework for a clinical application involving 
skull-brain co-development in infants, leading to a platform for 
craniosynostosis modeling. Craniosynostosis occurs when one or more sutures are 
fused early in life, resulting in an abnormal skull shape. Surgery is required 
to reopen the suture and reduce intracranial pressure, but is difficult without 
any predictive model to assist surgical planning. We aim to study normal 
brain-skull growth by computer simulation, which requires a head model and 
appropriate mathematical methods for brain and skull growth respectively. On the 
basis of our previous model, we further specified suture model into fibrous and 
cartilaginous sutures and develop algorithm for skull extension. We evaluate the 
resulting simulation by comparison with datasets of cases and normal growth.

Physicians often assume that patients have a negligible aversion to lifelong 
medication and that medication disutility is almost zero.  While a large number 
of patients are willing to take a lifelong primary prevention therapy that allow 
them to live longer, there is a group with extreme medication disutility 
desiring 10 years or more in life expectancy in order to consider therapy. Also, 
the expected benefits of medication often exceed the real benefits. When 
initiating medication the patients should be actively involved in the 
decision-making process. An individualized approach could potentially increase 
the adherence to therapy.

Advances in hemophilia care have led to increased life expectancy and new 
challenges in the management of the aging hemophilia population, including 
cardiovascular risk. Despite the deep knowledge into cardiovascular disease in 
terms of pathophysiology, risk prediction, prevention, early detection and 
management gained over the last decades, studies in hemophiliacs are scarce and 
mainly descriptive. As a growing amount of evidence points towards a similar or 
increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in hemophilia 
compared to the general population, the role of non-traditional, disease-related 
and treatment-related cardiovascular risk factors remains under investigation. 
Better understanding of cardiovascular risk in hemophilia is mandatory for 
proper cardiovascular risk prevention and management. Therefore, this review 
aims to summarize current knowledge on cardiovascular risk in hemophilia 
patients focusing on a) cardiovascular risk factors (traditional, 
non-traditional, disease-related and treatment-related), b) cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality and c) cardiovascular prevention and management.

Contamination.

Globally, the popularity of seafood consumption is increasing exponentially. To 
meet the demands of a growing market, the seafood industry has increasingly been 
innovating ways to keep their products fresh and safe while increasing 
production. Marine environments harbor several species of indigenous 
microorganisms, some of which, including Vibrio spp., may be harmful to humans, 
and all of which are part of the natural microbiota of the seafood. After 
harvest, seafood products are often shipped over large geographic distances, 
sometimes for prolonged periods, during which the food must stay fresh and 
pathogen proliferation must be minimized. Upon arrival there is often a strong 
desire, arising from both culinary and nutritional considerations, to consume 
seafood products raw, or minimally cooked. This supply chain along with popular 
preferences have increased challenges for the seafood industry. This has 
resulted in a desire to develop methodologies that reduce pathogenic and 
spoilage organisms in seafood items to comply with regulations and result in 
minimal changes to the taste, texture, and nutritional content of the final 
product. This mini-review discusses and compares several emerging technologies, 
such as treatment with plant derived natural compounds, phage lysis, 
high-pressure processing, and irradiation for their ability to control 
pathogenic vibrios, limit the growth of spoilage organisms, and keep the desired 
organoleptic properties of the seafood product intact.

Gaps between Evidence and Practice in Postoperative Radiotherapy for Prostate 
Cancer: Focus on Toxicities and the Effects on Health-Related Quality of Life.

Raziee H(1), Berlin A(1).

Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) after prostatectomy for patients with high-risk 
features [extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and 
positive margin] has been shown to be associated with improved biochemical 
disease-free survival in three large randomized trials and with improved overall 
survival in one. Similarly, salvage radiotherapy (SRT) can effectively achieve 
biochemical control in a significant proportion of patients with a rising PSA 
after surgery. Nonetheless, both approaches of postoperative RT remain highly 
underutilized. This might be partly due to concerns with overtreatment inherent 
to adjuvant approaches, and/or hesitance about causing radiation toxicities and 
their subsequent effects on the patient's quality of life. Herein, we review the 
literature lending evidence to these arguments. We show recent series of ART/SRT 
and their low rates of acute and long-term toxicities, translating only in 
transient decline in quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes. We conclude that concerns 
with side effects should not preclude the recommendation of an effective and 
curative-intent therapy for men with prostate cancer initially treated with 
radical surgery.

Electrocardiographic Changes and Arrhythmia in Fabry Disease.

Namdar M(1).

Author information:
(1)Service de Cardiologie, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève , Geneva , 
Switzerland.

Fabry disease is an X-chromosome-linked lysosomal storage disease characterized 
by a deficient activity or, in most males, absence of the enzyme α-galactosidase 
A (a-Gal A) leading to systemic, primary lysosomal accumulation of 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) (1). Recent literature refers to an overall birth 
prevalence of 1:40,000-170,000; however, such data do not allow an estimation on 
an actual patient number suffering from Fabry disease (2). Multisystem morbidity 
commonly develops in childhood and, with progression of the disease, 
life-threatening complications often occur in adulthood, including renal 
failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, neuropathy, and stroke (3-6). Life 
expectancy is reduced by an average of 15 years in female patients and 20 years 
in male patients (7, 8). The pathognomonic Gb3 accumulation has been repeatedly 
observed over the past decades by many groups in vascular endothelial and smooth 
muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, cardiac conduction tissue, and valvular 
fibroblasts (3). Although incompletely described, it is likely that inflammatory 
and neurohormonal mechanisms are involved in subsequent cellular and vascular 
dysfunction, leading to tissue ischemia, hypertrophy, and fibrosis (9). 
Furthermore, recently published works on cardiomyocyte dysfunction and 
conduction tissue involvement have suggested that cardiac dysfunction may 
reflect increased myocardial nitric oxide production with oxidative damage of 
cardiomyocyte myofilaments and DNA, causing cell dysfunction and death, and 
accelerated conduction with prolonged refractoriness and electric instability 
(10, 11).

Pregnancy after heart surgery--challenges.

Plesinac S, Pilić I, Babović I.

PURPOSE: Advances in cardiac surgery significantly improve life expectancy and 
quality of life of patients with congenital or acquired heart disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 146 pregnant women who had 
antenatal care and gave birth at the Institute of Gynecology and Obstetrics in 
an interval of ten years from 1994-2004. Patients were divided in four groups 
according to the type of heart surgery. Group I included four patients with 
surgically corrected coarctation of the aorta. Group II included 27 patients 
with correction of the ostial stenosis. Group III had 68 patients with 
correction of congenital heart diseases, and group IV had 47 patients with 
artificial heart valves.
RESULTS: There was 4% of heart failure after delivery. The incidence of 
hemorrhagic complications during pregnancy was 2.7% and 4.1% after delivery. The 
incidence of thromboembolic complications after delivery was 6%. Four newborns 
died; one of hydrocephalus and three of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Two 
patients died.
CONCLUSION: Patients with artificial heart valves need an enhanced level of 
medical care during pregnancy and labor.

BACKGROUND: In children with asthma, web-based monitoring and 
inflammation-driven therapy may lead to improved asthma control and reduction in 
medications. However, the cost-effectiveness of these monitoring strategies is 
yet unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of web-based monthly monitoring 
and of 4-monthly monitoring of FENO as compared with standard care.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomised controlled 
multicentre trial with a 1-year follow-up. Two hundred and seventy-two children 
with asthma, aged 4-18 years, were randomised to one of three strategies. In 
standard care, treatment was adapted according to Asthma Control Test (ACT) at 
4-monthly visits, in the web-based strategy also according to web-ACT at 1 month 
intervals, and in the FENO-based strategy according to ACT and FENO at 4-monthly 
visits. Outcome measures were patient utilities, healthcare costs, societal 
costs and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in QALYs and costs 
between the three strategies. The web-based strategy had 77% chance of being 
most cost-effective from a healthcare perspective at a willingness to pay a 
generally accepted €40 000/QALY. The FENO-based strategy had 83% chance of being 
most cost-effective at €40 000/QALY from a societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Economically, web-based monitoring was preferred from a healthcare 
perspective, while the FENO-based strategy was preferred from a societal 
perspective, although in QALYs and costs no statistically significant changes 
were found as compared with standard care. As clinical outcomes also favoured 
the web-based and FENO-based strategies, these strategies may be useful 
additions to standard care.

This analysis of the United Kingdom health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. It provides an overview of how the 
national health services operate in the four nations that make up the United 
Kingdom, as responsibility for organizing health financing and services was 
devolved from 1997. With devolution, the health systems in the United Kingdom 
have diverged in the details of how services are organized and paid for, but all 
have maintained national health services which provide universal access to a 
comprehensive package of services that are mostly free at the point of use. 
These health services are predominantly financed from general taxation and 83.5% 
of total health expenditure in the United Kingdom came from public sources in 
2013. Life expectancy has increased steadily across the United Kingdom, but 
health inequalities have proved stubbornly resistant to improvement, and the gap 
between the most deprived and the most privileged continues to widen, rather 
than close. The United Kingdom faces challenges going forward, including how to 
cope with the needs of an ageing population, how to manage populations with poor 
health behaviours and associated chronic conditions, how to meet patient 
expectations of access to the latest available medicines and technologies, and 
how to adapt a system that has limited resources to expand its workforce and 
infrastructural capacity so it can rise to these challenges.

Site-Specific Albumination as an Alternative to PEGylation for the Enhanced 
Serum Half-Life in Vivo.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been widely used as a serum half-life extender of 
therapeutic proteins. However, due to immune responses and low degradability of 
PEG, developing serum half-life extender alternatives to PEG is required. Human 
serum albumin (HSA) has several beneficial features as a serum half-life 
extender, including a very long serum half-life, good degradability, and low 
immune responses. In order to further evaluate the efficacy of HSA, we compared 
the extent of serum half-life extension of a target protein, superfolder green 
fluorescent protein (sfGFP), upon HSA conjugation with PEG conjugation 
side-by-side. Combination of site-specific incorporation of 
p-azido-l-phenylalanine into sfGFP and copper-free click chemistry achieved the 
site-specific conjugation of a single HSA, 20 kDa PEG, or 30 kDa PEG to sfGFP. 
These sfGFP conjugates exhibited the fluorescence comparable to or even greater 
than that of wild-type sfGFP (sfGFP-WT). In mice, HSA-conjugation to sfGFP 
extended the serum half-life 9.0 times compared to that of unmodified sfGFP, 
which is comparable to those of PEG-conjugated sfGFPs (7.3 times for 20 kDa PEG 
and 9.5 times for 30 kDa PEG). These results clearly demonstrated that HSA was 
as effective as PEG in extending the serum half-life of a target protein. 
Therefore, with the additional favorable features, HSA is a good serum half-life 
extender of a (therapeutic) protein as an alternative to PEG.

Ageing and lifespan are strongly affected by metabolism. The maximal possible 
uptake of oxygen is not only a good predictor of performance in endurance 
sports, but also of life expectancy. Figuratively speaking, healthy ageing is a 
competitive sport. Although the root cause of ageing is damage to 
macromolecules, it is the balance with repair processes that is decisive. 
Reduced or intermittent nutrition, hormones and intracellular signalling 
pathways that regulate metabolism have strong effects on ageing. Homeostatic 
regulatory processes tend to keep the environment of the cells within relatively 
narrow bounds. On the other hand, the body is constantly adapting to physical 
activity and food consumption. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and other 
processes indicate youth and health. A (homeo)dynamic aspect of homeostasis 
deteriorates with age. We are now in a position to develop computational models 
of human metabolism and the dynamics of heart rhythm and oxygen transport that 
will advance our understanding of ageing. Computational modelling of the 
connections between dietary restriction, metabolism and protein turnover may 
increase insight into homeostasis of the proteins in our body. In this way, the 
computational reconstruction of human physiological processes, the Physiome, can 
help prevent frailty and age-related disease.

Introduction This is a single-center clinical study for the evaluation of 
safety, efficacy, and performance of endovenous cyanoacrylate (Sapheon Venaseal 
Closure System, now Medtronic Medical) for the treatment of great saphenous vein 
(GSV) reflux. Methods Primary outcome measures included the GSV obliteration, 
with clinical recurrence on follow up as detected by serial clinical and duplex 
examinations of patients at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. Venous 
clinical severity score (VCSS), Aberdeen varicose vein questionnaire (AVVQ), 
Short Form Health Survey 36 Item (SF-36) questionnaires were used at clinical 
follow up. Diameter of the GSV, treatment length of the GSV, and pretreatment 
clinical severity of the varicose vein were analyzed to predict recanalization 
using Cox regression analysis. Results Fifty-seven legs in 29 patients with 
primary varicose veins were included. One week follow-up duplex showed 
successful obliteration of the GSV in all except one of the legs. Two legs had 
minimal extension of thrombus to deep vein. None of the patients had deep venous 
thrombosis. All the patients were discharged the same day of operation. Median 
time to return to work was 1 day (range 1-16 days). Our VCSS, AVVQ, and the 
SF-36 physical and mental scores changed from a mean of 6.91, 23.66, 44.24, 
54.26 at baseline to 2.43, 6.10, 43.85, 52.50 at 1 month post operation, 
respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the GSV closure rates were 
98.2%, 94.3%, 89.7%, and 78.5% at post-op 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year, 
respectively. With median follow-up period of 9 months (range 1-13 months), no 
clinical recurrence of varicosity was observed. Mean GSV diameter ≥8 mm was a 
significant predictor for recanalization (hazard ratio 6.92, 95%CI 1.34-35.67, 
p = 0.021). Conclusion This study showed that the use of endovenous 
cyanoacrylate in the treatment of the GSV reflux was safe. All patients had 
symptomatic improvement as shown by the VCSS and AVVQ.

obesity in childhood.

BACKGROUND: Interventions to tackle childhood obesity have been devised in 
response to the rising prevalence of childhood obesity. However, efficiency of 
these interventions remains a concern. Cost-utility analysis, representing 
health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), is a type of 
economic evaluation that has widely been recommended in assessing efficiency of 
health interventions. However, certain limitations in using QALYs remain 
specifically difficult in QALYs estimation. This study estimates the long-term 
QALYs gain from reversing childhood obesity in Thailand.
METHODS: An economic model was developed to estimate long-term QALYs of the 
youth aged 3-18 for the BMI status in childhood, which were categorized into 
three groups: normal weight, overweight, and obese. Long-term QALYs were 
estimated between ages 35 and 100, according to children's age, sex, and BMI 
status. Differences in QALYs between BMI status groups were calculated to 
represent the QALYs gain for youth from reversing obesity and overweight. The 
future outcomes were discounted at 3 % per annum in the base-case analysis; the 
discount rates of 0, 1.5, 3.5, and 5 % were also applied in the sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: QALYs gained from reversing childhood obesity increase with age, 
starting from 0.040 and 0.083 QALYs at age 3 to 0.590 and 0.553 QALYs at age 18 
in boys and girls, respectively. Reversing overweight and obesity in girls 
produces more QALYs than in boys between ages 3 and 17.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficiency is an important issue in allocating public healthcare 
resources to maximize social benefits. The results of this study facilitate 
long-term QALYs estimation with respect to BMI status in childhood, which could 
encourage more routine economic evaluation of child obesity interventions and 
maximize their health benefits.

Forecasts of life expectancy (LE) have fuelled debates about the sustainability 
and dependability of pension and healthcare systems. Of relevance to these 
debates are inequalities in LE by education. In this paper, we present a method 
of forecasting LE for different educational groups within a population. As a 
basic framework we use the Li-Lee model that was developed to forecast mortality 
coherently for different groups. We adapted this model to distinguish between 
overall, sex-specific, and education-specific trends in mortality, and 
extrapolated these time trends in a flexible manner. We illustrate our method 
for the population aged 65 and over in the Netherlands, using several data 
sources and spanning different periods. The results suggest that LE is likely to 
increase for all educational groups, but that differences in LE between 
educational groups will widen. Sensitivity analyses illustrate the advantages of 
our proposed method.

The concept of risk assessment and the identification of surgical unfitness for 
vascular intervention is a particularly controversial issue today as the 
minimally invasive surgical population has increased not only in volume but also 
in complexity (comorbidity profile) and age, requiring an improved pre-operative 
selection and definition of high risk. A practical step by step (three steps, 
two points for each) approach for surgical risk assessment is suggested in this 
review. As a general rule, the identification of a "high risk" patient for 
vascular surgery follows a step by step process where the risk is clearly 
defined, quantified (when too "high"?), and thereby stratified based on the 
procedure, the patient, and the hospital, with the aid of predictive risk 
scores. However, there is no standardized, updated, and objective definition for 
surgical unfitness today. The major gap in the current literature on the 
definition of high risk in vascular patients explains the lack of sound 
validated predictive systems and limited generalizability of risk scores in 
vascular surgery. In addition, the concept of fitness is an evolving tool and 
many traditional high risk criteria and definitions are no longer valid. Given 
the preventive purpose of most vascular procedures performed in elderly 
asymptomatic patients, the decision to pursue or withhold surgery requires 
realistic estimates not only regarding individual peri-operative mortality, but 
also life expectancy, healthcare priorities, and the patient's primary goals, 
such as prolongation of life versus maintenance of independence or symptom 
relief. The overall "frailty" and geriatric risk burden, such as cognitive, 
functional, social, and nutritional status, are variables that should be also 
included in the analyses for stratification of surgical risk in elderly vascular 
patients.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the standard of care 
for inoperable patients, and the preferred treatment option for high-risk 
patients with severe aortic stenosis. Given that this therapy was intended for 
elderly patients with limited life expectancy, long-term durability has not been 
in the focus. Now that TAVI is increasingly being used in patients with 
intermediate-risk and lower-risk profiles, device durability has gained 
importance. The available mid-term results for TAVI are promising; however, 
little is known about the fate of TAVI devices beyond 5 years. The experience 
with long-term durability of surgical valves shows that ≥10-year follow-up is 
required to ensure reliable durability data. In this Review, we discuss the 
existing studies of TAVI durability, highlight differences between surgical and 
transcatheter treatment of aortic stenosis that might influence durability, and 
present a clinical solution for failed prostheses. Furthermore, we suggest how 
device durability might influence the future selection of patients for TAVI.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Older adults in residential care and assisted living 
(RC/AL) are less healthy than the general elderly population, and some have 
needs similar to those in nursing homes, making this an important group in which 
to assess potential overuse or underuse of preventive services. We determined 
the health status of RC/AL residents and distinguished characteristics between 
those who may and may not benefit from preventive services requiring a life 
expectancy ≥5 years.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample 
of RC/AL residents using 2010 data from the National Survey of Residential Care 
Facilities. The primary outcome was the weighted frequency distribution of 
health states using three predictive mortality indices: Charlson Comorbidity 
Index, 4-year mortality index, and 9-year mortality index.
RESULTS: A total of 666,700 of 733,300 (weighted) residents met criteria for 
inclusion. Based on the three indices, 10%-15% were in good health, 11%-70% in 
intermediate health, and 20%-76% in poor health.
IMPLICATIONS: Using triangulation between 3 well-validated mortality indices, 
10%-15% of RC/AL residents are in good health and highly likely to benefit from 
preventive services that require ≥5 year life expectancy. In addition, many 
residents have uncertain benefit and would benefit from shared decision making.

Learning and memory are crucial functions which enable insect pollinators to 
efficiently locate and extract floral rewards. Exposure to pesticides or 
infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in 
cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these 
stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, 
sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have 
compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to 
field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory 
learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony 
fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema 
ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were 
observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3% infection success). Nevertheless, 
Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, 
but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights 
the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our 
results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee 
species to others. This has important implications for regulatory risk 
assessments which generally use honeybees as a model for all bees.

The discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the causative 
organism of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the inability of 
modern medicine to find a cure for it has placed HIV as one of the most dreaded 
pathogens of the 21(st) century. With millions of people infected with HIV, it 
was once thought to result in "medical apocalypse". However, with the advent of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART), it is now possible to control HIV. Adherence to 
ART helps to keep the viral load under control and prolong the time of 
progression to AIDS, resulting in near normal life expectancy. Even with the 
introduction of ART, a substantial number of patients fail to adhere due to a 
variety of reasons, including adverse side effects, drug abuse, mental 
disorders, socioeconomic status, literacy, and social stigma. With the 
availability of so many options for HIV treatment at each stage of the disease 
progression, physicians can switch between the treatment regimens to avoid 
and/or minimize the adverse effects of drugs. Close monitoring, major social 
reforms, and adequate counselling should also be implemented to circumvent other 
challenges.

Immunological strategies to target HIV persistence.

(1)Department of Virus Immunology, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute 
for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this article is to review recent advances in 
immunotherapeutic approaches aiming at reducing the latent HIV reservoir.
RECENT FINDINGS: HIV-1 establishes early during infection a pool of latently 
infected cells that persist long term and are largely undetectable to the immune 
system. Highly active antiretroviral therapy has dramatically improved the life 
expectancy and life quality of HIV-1-infected individuals, but is incapable of 
eliminating the pool of latently HIV-1-infected cells. Recent studies have 
started to test immunotherapeutic interventions in combination with latency 
reversing agents to reduce the latent HIV-1 reservoir, including approaches 
aimed at enhancing antiviral T-cell immunity, innate immunity, and 
virus-specific antibodies.
SUMMARY: The better understanding of virus-specific immunity and the pathways 
used by HIV-1 to evade host immune responses have enabled the development of new 
strategies focusing on targeting latently HIV-1-infected cells, with the goal to 
reduce the HIV-1 reservoir. Here, we will review recent advances in harnessing 
effector cells of the immune system, including CD8 T cells and natural killer 
cells, antiviral antibodies and new immunomodulatory molecules, to target HIV-1 
persistence.

PURPOSE: The present study was designed to explore to what extent low-intensity 
resistance exercise-induced acute hypertension influences intracranial cerebral 
perfusion.
METHODS: Twelve healthy participants performed one-legged static knee extension 
exercise at 30% maximal voluntary contraction for 2 min. Blood flow to the 
internal and external carotid arteries (ICA/ECA) were evaluated by duplex 
ultrasonography.
RESULTS: ICA blood flow increased and reached a plateau before stabilizing 60 s 
into exercise despite continued increases in cardiac output and arterial blood 
pressure. ICA conductance significantly decreased by -14.4% ±13.8% at the end of 
exercise (P < 0.01), whereas in contrast, ECA blood flow (P < 0.01) and 
conductance were shown to increase (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate that low-intensity resistance 
exercise was associated with vasodilation of the ECA that was accompanied by 
vasoconstriction of the ICA. We propose that the heterogeneity and reciprocal 
regulation of intracranial cerebral blood flow reflect an adaptive 
neuroprotective mechanism that serves to protect the brain and associated 
vasculature against the structural damage associated with resistance 
exercise-induced hypertension.
