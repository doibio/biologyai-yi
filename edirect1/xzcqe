cost-effective treatment option with a decision certainty of 72 and 67% in the 
United Kingdom and United States, respectively. Despite producing more QALYs 
than either unilateral CI or bimodal stimulation, bilateral CI was found not to 
be cost-effective because it was associated with excessive costs. Compared with 
unilateral CI, the increased costs of bimodal stimulation were outweighed by the 
gain in quality of life. Bimodal stimulation was found to cost an extra £174 per 
person in the United Kingdom ($937 in the US) and yielded an additional 0.114 
QALYs compared with unilateral CI, resulting in an Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of £1521 per QALY gained in the United Kingdom 
($8192/QALY in the United States). The most influential variable was the utility 
gained from the simultaneous use of both devices (CI+HA) compared with 
Unilateral CI. The value of further research was £4,383,922 at £20,000/QALY 
($86,955,460 at $50,000/QALY in the United States).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of the most cost-effective treatment 
alternative for adults with bilateral severe to profound deafness from publicly 
funded healthcare perspectives of the United Kingdom and United States. Bimodal 
stimulation was found to be more cost-effective than unilateral and bilateral CI 
across a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. If there is scope for 
future research, conducting interventional designs to obtain utilities for 
bimodal stimulation compared with unilateral CI would reduce decision 
uncertainty considerably.

Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an invasive stink bug 
species that feeds on cruciferous plants and can cause substantial damage to 
crops. Little is known about the dispersal behavior of B. hilaris, but movement 
is important because of the way this pest moves from senescing weed hosts into 
crop fields. Perhaps, B. hilaris residing on declining weed hosts become 
starved, which alters their normal locomotor activity and initiates dispersal. 
We examined the influence of starvation on the locomotor behavior of multiple 
life stages of B. hilaris under laboratory and outdoor conditions. We starved 
nymph (2nd/3rd and 4th/5th instars) and adult (female and male) stages for 0, 
24, and 48 h. We measured distance moved in the laboratory and then distance 
moved and turning ratio outdoors. In the laboratory, the younger nymphs moved 
shortest distances when starved for 24 h, whereas late-instar nymphs (4th-5th 
instars) and adult B. hilaris that were starved moved farther than non-starved 
individuals. In the outdoor setting, environmental conditions, specifically 
surface temperature were important in determining how starvation affected 
distance moved. Starved insects were more responsive (moved farther) for a given 
change in temperature than non-starved insects. At lower temperatures, B. 
hilaris tended to move farther when non-starved and at higher temperatures, 
moved longer distances when starved, at least for certain stages. Increased 
starvation also led to more directional movement. Our results indicate that 
starvation influences aspects of movement for B. hilaris and that these effects 
can be influenced by temperature.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early liver transplantation (without requiring a minimum 
period of sobriety) for severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is 
controversial: many centers delay eligibility until a specific period of 
sobriety (such as 6 months) has been achieved. To inform ongoing debate and 
policy, we modeled long-term outcomes of early vs delayed liver transplantation 
for patients with AH.
METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to simulate early vs delayed liver 
transplantation for patients with severe AH and different amounts of alcohol use 
after transplantation: abstinence, slip (alcohol use followed by sobriety), or 
sustained use. Mortality of patients before transplantation was determined by 
joint-effect model (based on Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] and Lille 
scores). We estimated life expectancies of patients receiving early vs delayed 
transplantation (6-month wait before placement on the waitlist) and life years 
lost attributable to alcohol use after receiving the liver transplant.
RESULTS: Patients offered early liver transplantation were estimated to have an 
average life expectancy of 6.55 life years, compared with an average life 
expectancy of 1.46 life years for patients offered delayed liver transplantation 
(4.49-fold increase). The net increase in life expectancy from offering early 
transplantation was highest for patients with Lille scores of 0.50-0.82 and MELD 
scores of 32 or more. Patients who were offered early transplantation and had no 
alcohol use afterward were predicted to survive 10.85 years compared with 3.62 
years for patients with sustained alcohol use after transplantation (7.23 life 
years lost). Compared with delayed transplantation, early liver transplantation 
increased survival times in all simulated scenarios and combinations of Lille 
and MELD scores.
CONCLUSIONS: In a modeling study of assumed carefully selected patients with AH, 
early vs delayed liver transplantation (6 months of abstinence from alcohol 
before transplantation) increased survival times of patients, regardless of 
estimated risk of sustained alcohol use after transplantation. These findings 
support early liver transplantation for patients with severe AH. The net 
increase in life expectancy was maintained in all simulated extreme scenarios 
but should be confirmed in prospective studies. Sustained alcohol use after 
transplantation significantly reduced but did not eliminate the benefits of 
early transplantation. Strategies are needed to prevent and treat 
posttransplantation use of alcohol.

Increasingly, it is being recognised that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not 
just an acute event but instead results in ongoing neuronal injury that may lead 
to chronic impairments in multiple cognitive domains. Of these, deficits in 
executive function are one of the more common changes reported following TBI, 
and are a major predictor of well-being, social function and quality of life in 
individuals with a history of TBI. In order to fully understand the relationship 
between TBI and executive dysfunction, including brain mechanisms that may 
account for this, experimental models are clearly needed. However, to date, 
there have been a lack of preclinical studies systematically comparing the 
effect of injury severity on executive function, particularly at long-term 
timepoints post-injury. Furthermore, many previous studies have not used 
behavioural measures that are sensitive to the full range of executive function 
impairments that may manifest after injury, particularly in models of diffuse 
axonal injury (Lv et al.). The current study aimed to investigate the temporal 
profile, up to 12 months post-injury, of the evolution of executive dysfunction 
following different severities of injury in an experimental model of DAI. In 
order to do so, we utilised a rodent touchscreen paradigm to administer the 5 
Choice- Continuous Performance Task (5C-CPT), an extension of the 5-choice 
serial reaction time task (5CSRT). Interestingly, there were no differences in 
learning, motivation, attention, response time or impulsivity at 1 month, 6 
months or 12 months post-injury in any of the TBI groups compared to sham, 
regardless of the initial severity of the injury. Instead, most of the effects 
on executive function seen at the 12 month timepoint appeared to be a result of 
ageing, not injury. As even the 12-month timepoint represents middle age in the 
rat, future studies will be needed to further probe these effects, in order to 
determine whether DAI may influence the presentation of executive dysfunction in 
older age.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In spite of the rich bio-cultural diversity 
found in the Neotropics relatively few herbal drugs native to South America are 
included in the global pharmacopoeia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the attempt to historically explain the inclusion of 
herbal drugs into official pharmacopoeias we consider the disparate epidemiology 
and cultural evolution of the New and the Old World. We then trace the 
development of pharmacopoeias and review forces that worked towards and against 
the synchronization of pharmacopoeias and highlight the role of early chemical 
and pharmacological studies in Europe. Finally, we compare the share of exotic 
and native herbal drug species included in the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia with the 
share of exotic and native species included in the European Pharmacopoeia as 
well as those used for products registered with ANVISA.
RESULTS: The domination of Eurasian herbal drugs in the European Pharmacopoeia 
seems to be conditioned by the geographical extension of Eurasia, which 
facilitated the interchange of materia medica and the creation of a consensus of 
use since ancient times. At the time of the Conquest the epidemiology of the 
Amerindian populations resembled that of pre-agriculturalist societies while no 
written consensus around efficacious medicine existed. Subsequently, introduced 
and well-tried plant species of the Old World gained therapeutic importance in 
the New World.
CONCLUSION: The research focus in Europe and the US resulted in a persistence of 
herbal drugs with a historic importance in the European and US pharmacopoeias, 
which gained a status as safe and efficacious. During the last decades only few 
ethnopharmacological field-studies have been conducted with indigenous 
Amerindian groups living in the Brazilian Amazon, which might be attributable to 
difficulties in obtaining research permissions. Newly adopted regulations 
regarding access to biodiversity and traditional knowledge as well as the 
simplified procedure for licencing herbal medicinal products in Brazil prospects 
an interesting future for those aiming at developing herbal medicine based on 
bio-cultural diversity and respecting the protocols regulating benefit sharing.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine 
acetate (ESL) monotherapy in adults with focal seizures (FS).
METHODS: Study 050 was a long-term, multicenter, open-label (OL) safety 
extension of two conversion-to-ESL monotherapy studies in adults with refractory 
FS. After participating in Study 045 or 046, patients started on ESL 1600 mg 
once daily (QD) (or 1200 mg if they previously had a dose reduction), and could 
adjust the dose 400 mg/week to a dose between 800-2400 mg QD. Patients could add 
up to two additional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This post-hoc analysis focuses 
on the actual monotherapy subgroup, which included patients in Studies 
045/046/050 who did not add additional AEDs. Study endpoints included treatment 
retention time, time on ESL monotherapy, change in standardized seizure 
frequency (SSF), change in quality of life (QoL) in epilepsy (QOLIE-31) and 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, and incidence of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); serious adverse events (SAEs), TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation, and TEAEs related to allergic reaction, hyponatremia 
and thyroid function were also evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 274 patients in the Study 050 full intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population and 140 patients in the actual monotherapy subgroup. Median treatment 
retention time and time on ESL monotherapy were both >5 years. Median reduction 
in SSF from baseline was 66.4% in the full ITT population and 78.3% in the 
actual monotherapy subgroup; responder (≥50% reduction in SSF) rates were 62.4% 
and 74.3%, respectively. QOLIE-31 scores increased from baseline in the full ITT 
population and the actual monotherapy subgroup (4.1- and 7.5-point increases, 
respectively). MADRS scores decreased from baseline in both the full ITT 
population and the actual monotherapy subgroup (0.7- and 2.9-point decreases, 
respectively). TEAEs occurred in 85.4% of patients in the full ITT population 
and 81.4% of patients in the actual monotherapy subgroup. Incidences of SAEs and 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation, as well as dizziness, depression, fall, 
partial seizures with secondary generalization, and complex partial seizures, 
were higher in the full ITT population than in the actual monotherapy subgroup. 
Allergic reactions, hyponatremia, and hypothyroidism were infrequent, 
particularly in the actual monotherapy subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this post-hoc analysis suggest that long-term 
treatment with ESL was effective and well tolerated, both as a monotherapy and 
in combination with other AEDs for FS. QoL and tolerability appeared to be 
better, and incidence of depression lower, in the patient population taking ESL 
as a monotherapy, compared with the population that included patients taking ESL 
as an adjunctive therapy.

Rice kefiran is superior in functionality, has high concentration of 
mucilaginous polysaccharide, and low lipid content, compared to conventional 
kefiran. However, reports on its physiological functionality, especially studies 
on life expectancy and aging, in model organisms are rare. In this study, 
nematodes were used as model organisms that were fed rice kefiran, along with 
Escherichia coli OP50, as a result of which, the lifespan of nematodes was 
extended and age-related retardation of mobility was suppressed. It also 
increased the heat stress resistance in nematodes. Experiments using daf-16 
deletion mutant revealed that rice kefiran functions via DAF-16. Thus, this 
study revealed the longevity, anti-aging and heat stress tolerance effects of 
rice kefiran in nematodes.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset 
neurodegenerative disease progressively affecting upper and lower motor neurons 
in the brain and spinal cord. Mean life expectancy is three to five years, with 
paralysis of muscles, respiratory failure and loss of vital functions being the 
common causes of death. Clinical manifestations of ALS are heterogeneous due to 
the mix of anatomic regions involvement and the variability in disease course; 
consequently, diagnosis and prognosis at the level of individual patient is 
really challenging. Prediction of ALS progression and stratification of patients 
into meaningful subgroups have been long-standing interests to clinical 
practice, research and drug development.
METHODS: We developed a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model on more than 4500 
ALS patients included in the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials 
Database (PRO-ACT), in order to detect probabilistic relationships among 
clinical variables and identify risk factors related to survival and loss of 
vital functions. Furthermore, the DBN was used to simulate the temporal 
evolution of an ALS cohort predicting survival and the time to impairment of 
vital functions (communication, swallowing, gait and respiration). A first 
attempt to stratify patients by risk factors and simulate the progression of ALS 
subgroups was also implemented.
RESULTS: The DBN model provided the prediction of ALS most probable trajectories 
over time in terms of important clinical outcomes, including survival and loss 
of autonomy in functional domains. Furthermore, it allowed the identification of 
biomarkers related to patients' clinical status as well as vital functions, and 
unrevealed their probabilistic relationships. For instance, DBN found that 
bicarbonate and calcium levels influence survival time; moreover, the model 
evidenced dependencies over time among phosphorus level, movement impairment and 
creatinine. Finally, our model provided a tool to stratify patients into 
subgroups of different prognosis studying the effect of specific variables, or 
combinations of them, on either survival time or time to loss of autonomy in 
specific functional domains.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the risk factors and the simulation allowed by our 
DBN model might enable better support for ALS prognosis as well as a deeper 
insight into disease manifestations, in a context of a personalized medicine 
approach.

Do trajectories of economic, work- and health-related disadvantages explain 
child welfare clients' increased mortality risk? A prospective cohort study.

BACKGROUND: Past research has shown that individuals who have had experiences of 
out-of-home care (OHC) in childhood have increased risks of premature mortality. 
Prior studies also suggest that these individuals are more likely to follow 
long-term trajectories that are characterised by economic, work-, and 
health-related disadvantages, compared to majority population peers. Yet, we do 
not know the extent to which such trajectories may explain their elevated 
mortality risks. The aim of this study is therefore to examine whether 
trajectories of economic, work-, and health-related disadvantages in midlife 
mediate the association between OHC experience in childhood and subsequent 
all-cause mortality.
METHODS: Utilising longitudinal Swedish data from a 1953 cohort (n = 14,294), 
followed from birth up until 2008 (age 55), this study applies gender-specific 
logistic regression analysis to analyse the association between OHC experience 
in childhood (ages 0-19; 1953-1972) and all-cause mortality (ages 47-55; 
2000-2008). A decomposition method developed for non-linear regression models is 
used to estimate mediation by trajectories of economic, work-, and 
health-related disadvantages (ages 39-46; 1992-1999), as indicated by social 
welfare receipt, unemployment, and mental health problems. To account for 
selection processes underlying placement in OHC, an alternative comparison group 
of children who were investigated by the child welfare committee but not placed, 
is included.
RESULTS: The results confirm that individuals with experience of OHC have more 
than a two-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality, for men (OR: 2.10, 95% 
CI: 1.42-3.11) and women (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.39-3.59) alike. Approximately 
one-third (31.1%) of the association among men, and one-fourth (27.4%) of the 
association among women, is mediated by the long-term trajectories of economic, 
work-, and health-related disadvantages. The group who were investigated but not 
placed shows similar, yet overall weaker, associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who come to the attention of the child welfare 
services, regardless of whether they are placed in out-of-home care or not, 
continue to be at risk of adverse outcomes across the life course. Preventing 
them from following trajectories of economic, work-, and health-related 
disadvantages could potentially reduce their risk of premature death.

BACKGROUND: Pistachio (Pistacia vera), one of the most important commercial nut 
crops worldwide, is highly adaptable to abiotic stresses and is tolerant to 
drought and salt stresses.
RESULTS: Here, we provide a draft de novo genome of pistachio as well as 
large-scale genome resequencing. Comparative genomic analyses reveal stress 
adaptation of pistachio is likely attributable to the expanded cytochrome P450 
and chitinase gene families. Particularly, a comparative transcriptomic analysis 
shows that the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic pathway plays an important role 
in salt tolerance in pistachio. Moreover, we resequence 93 cultivars and 14 wild 
P. vera genomes and 35 closely related wild Pistacia genomes, to provide 
insights into population structure, genetic diversity, and domestication. We 
find that frequent genetic admixture occurred among the different wild Pistacia 
species. Comparative population genomic analyses reveal that pistachio was 
domesticated about 8000 years ago and suggest that key genes for domestication 
related to tree and seed size experienced artificial selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insight into genetic underpinning of local 
adaptation and domestication of pistachio. The Pistacia genome sequences should 
facilitate future studies to understand the genetic basis of agronomically and 
environmentally related traits of desert crops.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common terminal pathway for many 
cancers, with an estimated United States incidence of more than 150,000 cases 
per year. MPE is an aggressive disease with a uniformly fatal prognosis and a 
life expectancy of only 3 to 12 months. The development of an effective targeted 
therapy represents a pressing unmet need. This commentary focuses on how 
cellular and humoral components condition the pleural space as a 
tumor-promoting, wound-healing environment. Despite an abundance of potential 
antigen presenting and effector cells in the pleura, their physical isolation by 
the mesothelial barrier, the concentration of cytokines and chemokines driving 
the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and M2 /Th-2 polarization, 
suppress tumor-specific immune effector responses. We argue that local immune 
repolarization must precede either immune checkpoint or cellular therapy to 
successfully eradicate pleural tumor. We further hypothesize that, because of 
its cellular content, a repolarized pleural space will provide an effective 
immune environment for generation of systemic anti-tumor response.

Comment in
    Lancet Glob Health. 2019 May;7(5):e548-e549.

BACKGROUND: In 2009, Gavi, the World Bank, and donors launched the pneumococcal 
Advance Market Commitment, which helped countries access more affordable 
pneumococcal vaccines. As many low-income countries begin to reach the threshold 
at which countries transition from Gavi support to self-financing (3-year 
average gross national income per capita of US$1580), they will need to consider 
whether to continue pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) use at full cost or to 
discontinue PCV in their childhood immunisation programmes. Using Kenya as a 
case study, we assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing PCV 
use.
METHODS: In this modelling and cost-effectiveness study, we fitted a dynamic 
compartmental model of pneumococcal carriage to annual carriage prevalence 
surveys and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in Kilifi, Kenya. We 
predicted disease incidence and related mortality for either continuing PCV use 
beyond 2022, the start of Kenya's transition from Gavi support, or its 
discontinuation. We calculated the costs per disability-adjusted life-year 
(DALY) averted and associated 95% prediction intervals (PI).
FINDINGS: We predicted that if PCV use is discontinued in Kenya in 2022, overall 
IPD incidence will increase from 8·5 per 100 000 in 2022, to 16·2 per 100 000 
per year in 2032. Continuing vaccination would prevent 14 329 (95% PI 
6130-25 256) deaths and 101 513 (4386-196 674) disease cases during that time. 
Continuing PCV after 2022 will require an estimated additional US$15·8 million 
annually compared with discontinuing vaccination. We predicted that the 
incremental cost per DALY averted of continuing PCV would be $153 (95% PI 
70-411) in 2032.
INTERPRETATION: Continuing PCV use is essential to sustain its health gains. 
Based on the Kenyan GDP per capita of $1445, and in comparison to other 
vaccines, continued PCV use at full costs is cost-effective (on the basis of the 
assumption that any reduction in disease will translate to a reduction in 
mortality). Although affordability is likely to be a concern, our findings 
support an expansion of the vaccine budget in Kenya.

BACKGROUND: Combining supervised exercise training (ET) and disease management 
program (DMP) may benefit people with heart failure (HF) but will require 
additional resources.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the 1-year cost-effectiveness of a 24-week ET program 
added to a post-discharge DMP in patients recently hospitalized with HF.
METHODS: Using randomized controlled trial data, within-trial cost-utility 
analyses were undertaken in the overall population (n = 278), patients aged <70 
(n = 180), and those aged ≥70 (n = 98). Incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) 
were calculated based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and healthcare costs 
from the perspective of a state health department (Queensland, Australia).
RESULTS: At the AU$50,000/QALY threshold, ET showed 29.6% and 1.7% probability 
of being cost-effective in the overall population (INMB AU$ -1,472) and patients 
aged ≥70 (INMB AU$ -11,469), respectively. In patients aged <70, ET was 
potentially cost-effective with 83.6% probability (INMB AU$4,059).
CONCLUSION: Adding ET to DMP was not cost-effective overall or in patients aged 
≥70 but was relatively cost-effective in those aged <70.

Appraising the cost-effectiveness of vaccines in the UK: Insights from the 
Department of Health Consultation on the revision of methods guidelines.

The UK Department of Health and Social Care recently held a consultation on 
proposals to revise the methods for the appraisal of cost-effectiveness of 
vaccines as applied by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation 
(JCVI). This presents a useful opportunity to review the current methods applied 
by the JCVI and examine the proposals for their improvement. Reviewing such 
methods is timely as there is mounting evidence that key elements of the health 
economic appraisal of all healthcare interventions in the UK need to be revised. 
In particular, there is a need to reassess both the cost-effectiveness threshold 
used to judge if an intervention is cost-effective and the discount rates used 
to assess the present value of health gains that occur in the future. 
Accordingly, we critically appraise the methods and their proposed changes. 
Overall, the 27 recommendations made within the recent consultation on proposed 
changes indicate a sensible and carefully considered approach to methods reform. 
We identify 11 recommendations that deserve further comment or reconsideration. 
In particular, there are reasons to question the basis for the proposed 
reduction of the discount rate from 3.5% to 1.5%. We also find that aspects of 
the current methods for considering uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of 
vaccines require revision. Both the discounting and uncertainty analyses 
recommendations do not appear to be well grounded in economic theory, 
empirically justified or consistent with the methods set out by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

A life care plan is a tool that is used for medical treatment planning and 
management purposes in many settings, including legal and forensic applications. 
This article summarizes the life care planning process and emphasizes the role 
of the psychiatrist in establishing a strong medical foundation for the plan. 
The psychiatrist's expertise in determining the nature and extent of the 
evaluee's psychiatric illness, prognosis, need for and likely benefit from 
treatment, and costs of care inform the life care planning process. Advising 
life care planners on these matters is a natural extension of the work of 
psychiatrists and forensic psychiatrists, who are accustomed to providing 
medical opinions to the courts. There are specific challenges when the 
psychiatrist creates recommendations for the life care plan; they include 
determining long-term prognosis, devising treatment plans, and identifying 
malingering. These questions are explored to assist the psychiatrist in 
providing the foundation for a life care plan.

BACKGROUND: Menopause is defined as the time of cessation of ovarian function 
resulting in permanent amenorrhea. Menopause is associated with various symptoms 
such as physical, vasomotor, sexual, and psychological symptoms. Depression is a 
common symptom in postmenopausal women as menopause is associated with the end 
of the fertile period of a women's life. Menopause is an important subject to 
study as due to increase in life expectancy and improved health care delivery 
number of postmenopausal women is significantly increasing.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of 
depression and its association with sociodemographic factors in postmenopausal 
women in an urban resettlement colony of Delhi.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted 
among 580 postmenopausal women who were resident of Gokulpuri in North-East 
Delhi, using a predesigned, pretested, and semi-structured interview schedule. 
Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) scale was used to find out the prevalence of 
depression. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-22 version.
RESULTS: In our study, 58.4% postmenopausal women were normal with no 
depression, 38.3% were in a mild depression, and 3.3% women were having moderate 
depression. Depression was more prevalent in women belonging to the younger age 
group, lower socioeconomic status, and illiterate women. Furthermore, the 
prevalence of depression was more in women who were divorced or widow.
CONCLUSIONS: Study revealed prevalence of depression in significant number of 
postmenopausal women. To improve the quality of life of women in postmenopausal 
period, diagnosis of depression and relevant influencing factors is important.

Motor neuron disease can be viewed as an umbrella term describing a 
heterogeneous group of conditions, all of which are relentlessly progressive and 
ultimately fatal. The average life expectancy is 2 years, but with a broad range 
of months to decades. Biomarker research deepens disease understanding through 
exploration of pathophysiological mechanisms which, in turn, highlights targets 
for novel therapies. It also allows differentiation of the disease population 
into sub-groups, which serves two general purposes: (a) provides clinicians with 
information to better guide their patients in terms of disease progression, and 
(b) guides clinical trial design so that an intervention may be shown to be 
effective if population variation is controlled for. Biomarkers also have the 
potential to provide monitoring during clinical trials to ensure target 
engagement. This review highlights biomarkers that have emerged from the fields 
of systemic measurements including biochemistry (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and 
urine analysis); imaging and electrophysiology, and gives examples of how a 
combinatorial approach may yield the best results. We emphasize the importance 
of systematic sample collection and analysis, and the need to correlate 
biomarker findings with detailed phenotype and genotype data.

Inconvenient Truths About Human Longevity.

Olshansky SJ(1), Carnes BA(2).

Author information:

Biostatistics.

The rise in human longevity is one of humanity's crowning achievements. Although 
advances in public health beginning in the 19th century initiated the rise in 
life expectancy, recent gains have been achieved by reducing death rates at 
middle and older ages. A debate about the future course of life expectancy has 
been ongoing for the last quarter century. Some suggest that historical trends 
in longevity will continue and radical life extension is either visible on the 
near horizon or it has already arrived; whereas others suggest there are 
biologically based limits to duration of life, and those limits are being 
approached now. In "inconvenient truths about human longevity" we lay out the 
line of reasoning and evidence for why there are limits to human longevity; why 
predictions of radical life extension are unlikely to be forthcoming; why health 
extension should supplant life extension as the primary goal of medicine and 
public health; and why promoting advances in aging biology may allow humanity to 
break through biological barriers that influence both life span and health span, 
allowing for a welcome extension of the period of healthy life, a compression of 
morbidity, but only a marginal further increase in life expectancy.

The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 
examine the characteristics of negative blood oxygen level-dependent (Negative 
BOLD) signals during motor execution. Subjects repeated extension and flexion of 
one of the following: the right hand, left hand, right ankle, or left ankle. 
Negative BOLD responses during hand movements were observed in the ipsilateral 
hemisphere of the hand primary sensorimotor area (SMI), medial frontal gyrus 
(MeFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Negative 
BOLD responses during foot movements were also noted in the bilateral hand SMI, 
MeFG, MFG, SFG, inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal 
gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, cingulate gyrus (CG), fusiform gyrus, and 
precuneus. A conjunction analysis showed that portions of the MeFG and CG 
involving similar regions to those of the default mode network were commonly 
deactivated during voluntary movements of the right/left hand or foot. The 
present results suggest that three mechanisms are involved in the Negative BOLD 
responses observed during voluntary movements: (1) transcallosal inhibition from 
the contralateral to ipsilateral hemisphere in the SMI, (2) the deactivated 
neural network with several brain regions, and (3) the default mode network in 
the MeFG and CG.

INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing the 
safety-engineered syringe (SES) to decrease hepatitis C burden resultant from 
unsafe injection practices in healthcare settings.
METHODS: A Markov process model for a hypothetical study cohort was developed 
over a 30-year time horizon to compare the adoption of SES use with the current 
strategy, conventional syringes (CS), in the Egyptian healthcare settings. The 
national treatment program was applied in both groups. Health benefits and total 
direct medical costs were estimated in both strategies.
RESULTS: The SES use demonstrated a reduction in the burden of 
injection-associated HCV infection because of unsafe practices in the Egyptian 
healthcare settings. The probability of HCV infection was 1.4% in the SES group 
and 40% in the CS group. Adoption of the SES use averted 177 hepatitis C cases 
and 157 hepatitis C-related deaths per 10 000 individuals. Introducing SES as a 
preventive strategy resulted in better quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)
