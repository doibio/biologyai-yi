BACKGROUNDS: The prevalence of loneliness increases among older adults, varies 
across countries, and is related to within-country socioeconomic, psychosocial, 
and health factors. The 2000-2019 pooled prevalence of loneliness among adults 
60 years and older went from 5.2% in Northern Europe to 24% in Eastern Europe, 
while in the US was 56% in 2012. The relationship between country-level factors 
and loneliness, however, has been underexplored. Because income inequality 
shapes material conditions and relative social deprivation and has been related 
to loneliness in 11 European countries, we expected a relationship between 
income inequality and loneliness in the US and 16 European countries.
METHODS: We used secondary cross-sectional data for 75,891 adults age 50+ from 
HRS (US 2014), ELSA (England, 2014), and SHARE (15 European countries, 2013). 
Loneliness was measured using the R-UCLA three-item scale. We employed 
hierarchical logistic regressions to analyse whether income inequality (GINI 
coefficient) was associated with loneliness prevalence.
RESULTS: The prevalence of loneliness was 25.32% in the US (HRS), 17.55% in 
England (ELSA) and ranged from 5.12% to 20.15% in European countries (SHARE). 
Older adults living in countries with higher income inequality were more likely 
to report loneliness, even after adjusting for the sociodemographic composition 
of the countries and their Gross Domestic Products per capita (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 
1.17-1.97).
DISCUSSION: Greater country-level income inequality was associated with higher 
prevalence of loneliness over and above individual-level sociodemographics. The 
present study is the first attempt to explore income inequality as a predictor 
of loneliness prevalence among older adults in the US and 16 European countries. 
Addressing income distribution and the underlying experience of relative 
deprivation might be an opportunity to improve older adults' life expectancy and 
wellbeing by reducing loneliness prevalence.

Aging results in remodeling of T cell immunity and is associated with poor 
clinical outcomes in age-related diseases such as cancer. Among the hallmarks of 
aging, changes in host and cellular metabolism critically affect the 
development, maintenance, and function of T cells. Although metabolic 
perturbations impact anti-tumor T cell responses, the link between 
age-associated metabolic dysfunction and anti-tumor immunity remains unclear. In 
this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of aged T cell 
metabolism, with a focus on the bioenergetic and immunologic features of T cell 
subsets unique to the aging process. We also survey insights into mechanisms of 
metabolic T cell dysfunction in aging and discuss the impacts of aging on the 
efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. As the average life expectancy continues to 
increase, understanding the interplay between age-related metabolic 
reprogramming and maladaptive T cell immunity will be instrumental for the 
development of therapeutic strategies for older patients.

OBJECTIVE: Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is prevalent in knee osteoarthritis 
(OA) patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and increases risk for 
prosthetic joint infection (PJI). We examined the cost-effectiveness of 
antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before dental procedures to reduce PJI in TKA 
recipients with T2DM.
DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated computer simulation 
of knee OA, to compare two strategies among TKA recipients with T2DM (mean age 
68 years, mean BMI 35.4 kg/m2): 1) AP before dental procedures and 2) no AP. 
Outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and lifetime medical 
costs. We used published efficacy of AP. We report incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and considered strategies with ICERs below 
well-accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds cost-effective. We conducted 
sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of findings to uncertainty in 
model input parameters. We used a lifetime horizon and healthcare sector 
perspective.
RESULTS: We found that AP added 1.0 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
$66,000 for every 1000 TKA recipients with T2DM, resulting in an ICER of 
$66,000/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, reduction of the probability of PJI, 
T2DM-associated risk of infection, or attribution of infections to dental 
procedures by 50% resulted in ICERs exceeding $100,000/QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses showed that AP was cost-effective in 32% and 58% of 
scenarios at WTP of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: AP prior to dental procedures is cost-effective for TKA recipients 
with T2DM. However, the cost-effectiveness of AP depends on the risk of PJI and 
efficacy of AP in this population.

BACKGROUND: Malignant tumors of reproductive system seriously threaten women's 
life and health. We analyzed the changes in mortality and disease burden of 
cervical cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer in China from 2006 to 2020 to 
provide a basis for formulating scientific prevention and control measures.
METHODS: Annual death data for cervical cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian 
cancer were collected from the Chinese Cause of Death Surveillance. The crude 
mortality rate (CMR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), annual percentage 
change (APC), and average APC (AAPC) were applied to analyze the trend of 
mortality. Loss of life expectancy (LLE) and years of life lost (YLL) were used 
to assess disease burden.
RESULTS: From 2006 to 2020, there was no significant change in the total ASMR 
and standardized YLL rates of malignant tumors of the reproductive system, 
leading to an average LLE of 0.18 years. The YLL rate was the highest in the 
55-59 age group. The mortality rate and disease burden of the three types of 
cancer have changed from uterine cancer higher than cervical cancer and ovarian 
cancer in 2006 to cervical cancer higher than ovarian cancer and uterine cancer 
in 2020. The ASMR and standardized YLL rate of uterine cancer showed a downward 
trend, and AAPC was - 5.21% (- 9.31% ~  - 0.91%) and - 6.07% 
(- 9.45% ~  - 2.58%), respectively. The mortality rates of cervical cancer and 
ovarian cancer remain high.
CONCLUSION: The mortality and disease burden of malignant tumors of the female 
reproductive system in China are still at a high level. It is necessary to 
improve screening and prevention strategies as soon as possible, improve the 
techniques of diagnosis and treatment, and take adequate measures to protect 
women's life and health.

Plain Language Summary: Malignant tumors of the female reproductive system are 
the leading causes of women's mortality worldwide, mainly including cervical 
cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer. Numerous studies have reported 
mortality changes in the three primary reproductive system cancers among 
different countries, with inconsistent temporal trends. In 2020, almost 17.51% 
of malignant tumors of the female reproductive system deaths occurred in China 
because of the large population base and severe aging. However, there are 
limited studies on the disease burden of malignant tumors of the female 
reproductive system in China. This study analyzed the mortality, YLL and LLE of 
cervical cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer using the National Death 
Cause Surveillance Dataset from 2006 to 2020. The findings revealed that 
mortality and disease burden of malignant tumors of the reproductive system 
showed no significant change. The mortality and disease burden of uterine cancer 
decreased significantly, but that of cervical cancer and ovarian cancer remain 
high. Cervical cancer has a higher mortality and disease burden than uterine 
cancer and ovarian cancer, making it the most severe malignant tumor of the 
female reproductive system. Screening and HPV vaccination will reduce the 
mortality and disease burden of cervical cancer in China, but this effect will 
take many years to manifest. Screening and prevention strategies for high-risk 
groups of uterine cancer and ovarian cancer should be established as soon as 
possible. In summary, the management and monitoring of malignant tumors of the 
female reproductive system should be strengthened.

BACKGROUND: Digital technologies facilitate everyday life, social connectedness, 
aging at home, well-being, and dignified care. However, older adults are 
disproportionately excluded from these benefits. Equal digital opportunities, 
access, and meaningful engagement require an understanding of older adults' 
experience across different stages of the technological engagement life cycle 
from nonuse and initial adoption to sustained use, factors influencing their 
decisions, and how the experience changes over time.
OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to identify the extent and breadth of existing 
literature on older adults' perspective on digital engagement and summarize the 
barriers to and facilitators for technological nonuse, initial adoption, and 
sustained digital technology engagement.
METHODS: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework for the scoping review 
process. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ACM digital 
library for primary studies published between 2005 and 2021. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were developed based on the Joanna Briggs Institute 
(participants, content, and context) framework. Studies that investigated the 
digital engagement experience as well as barriers to and facilitators of older 
adults' digital technology engagement were included. The characteristics of the 
study, types of digital technology, and digital engagement levels were analyzed 
descriptively. Content analysis was used to generate tentative elements using a 
congruent theme, and barriers and facilitators were mapped over the capability, 
opportunity, and motivation behavior change model (COM-B) and the theoretical 
domain framework. The findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for Scoping Reviews).
RESULTS: In total, 96 publications were eligible for the final charting and 
synthesis. Most of the studies were published over the past 5 years, 
investigated the initial adoption stage of digital engagement, and focused on 
everyday technologies. The most cited barriers and facilitators across the 
engagement stages from each COM-B component were capability (eg, physical and 
psychological changes and lack of skill), opportunity (eg, technological 
features, environmental context, and resources), and motivation (eg, optimism 
from perceived usefulness and beliefs about capability).
CONCLUSIONS: The COM-B model and theoretical domain framework provide a guide 
for identifying multiple and intertwined barriers and facilitators at each stage 
of digital engagement. There are limited studies looking into the whole spectrum 
of older adults' digital technology experience; in particular, studies on 
technological nonuse and sustained use stages are rare. Future research and 
practice should focus on tailored interventions accounting for the barriers to 
older adults' digital engagement and addressing capabilities, motivation, and 
opportunities; affordable, usable, and useful digital technologies, which 
address the changes and capability requirements of older adults and are 
cocreated with a value framework; and lifelong learning and empowerment to 
develop older adults' knowledge and skills to cope with digital technology 
development.

OBJECTIVE: to describe the years of potential life lost (YPLL) due to AIDS among 
the female population and analyze its association with race/skin color and 
social vulnerability indicators in Porto Alegre, capital city of the state of 
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
METHODS: this was a descriptive study that took into consideration AIDS deaths 
in female between 2007 and 2017; data were obtained from the Mortality 
Information System; crude values and YPLL rates per 1,000 deaths were 
calculated, taking into consideration health districts and race/skin color.
RESULTS: of the 1,539 deaths, approximately 51,000 years of potential life were 
estimated, representing 86.5 years lost/1,000 female; it could be seen a higher 
proportion of deaths among female of White race/ skin color (53.4%); however, a 
higher rate of YPLL was found among female of Black and mixed race/skin color 
living in regions of greater vulnerability.
CONCLUSION: the results suggest the impact of racial inequalities on the 
decrease in years of potential life due to AIDS deaths.

PURPOSE: This international survey aimed to evaluate the potential controversies 
regarding the management of first patellar dislocation amongst experienced knee 
surgeries in the treatment of the first episode of patellar dislocation without 
osteochondral fragments.
METHODS: An online survey was conducted from February 2021 to December 2021 to 
assess the global trend in the diagnosis and management of first-time patellar 
dislocation without osteochondral fragments. The online survey was accessible on 
the homepage of the website of the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee 
Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA). The questionnaire consisted of multiple-choice 
questions and was divided into three sections. The first section consisted of 
eight questions regarding demographic information, professional activity, and 
responder experience. The second section consisted of 13 questions regarding the 
approach to a first patellar dislocation (clinical examination, imaging, and 
rehabilitation). The third section contained 2 questions concerning the 
relevance of patient characteristics to the therapeutic algorithm (age, sports, 
and pathoanatomical predisposing risk factors).
RESULTS: A total of 438 orthopaedic surgeons worldwide completed the 
questionnaire. At the first approach to diagnose a first-time patellar 
dislocation, 251 (57%) of the surgeons requested plain radiographs, and 158 
(36%) requested magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In conservatively treated 
patients, 368 (84%) of the respondents recommended the use of a knee brace. 
Amongst them, 14 (3%) advocated its use for one week, 75 (17%) for two weeks, 
123 (28%) for three weeks, 105 (24%) for four weeks, and 97 (22%) for six weeks. 
In conservatively treated patients, 215 (49%) of the surgeons recommended load 
to tolerance, 148 (34%) recommended 30% to 60% of the bodyweight, and 75 (17%) 
advised against weight-bearing. More than half of the surgeons considered a 
patient aged less than 35 years practising contact sports to be a candidate for 
the medial patello-femoral ligament (MPFL) procedure. In addition, a tibial 
tuberosity to trochlear groove distance (TT-TG) distance of 15 to > 20 mm 
(for > 75% of the surgeons) and a trochlea types C and D (for > 70% of the 
surgeons) were considered possible indications for direct surgical management.
CONCLUSION: At the first approach to diagnose a first-time patellar dislocation, 
plain radiographs and MRI should be performed. In conservatively treated 
patients, most of the surgeons recommend weight-bearing to tolerance and a knee 
brace during the first four weeks, with range of motion of full extension to 30° 
during the first 15 days and up to 60° for an additional 15 days. Surgical 
management should be performed in patients in the second and third decades of 
life practising contact sports and in those patients who present types C and D 
trochlea dysplasia and patella alta.

Here we provide the 'Global Spectrum of Plant Form and Function Dataset', 
containing species mean values for six vascular plant traits. Together, these 
traits -plant height, stem specific density, leaf area, leaf mass per area, leaf 
nitrogen content per dry mass, and diaspore (seed or spore) mass - define the 
primary axes of variation in plant form and function. The dataset is based on 
ca. 1 million trait records received via the TRY database (representing ca. 
2,500 original publications) and additional unpublished data. It provides 92,159 
species mean values for the six traits, covering 46,047 species. The data are 
complemented by higher-level taxonomic classification and six categorical traits 
(woodiness, growth form, succulence, adaptation to terrestrial or aquatic 
habitats, nutrition type and leaf type). Data quality management is based on a 
probabilistic approach combined with comprehensive validation against expert 
knowledge and external information. Intense data acquisition and thorough 
quality control produced the largest and, to our knowledge, most accurate 
compilation of empirically observed vascular plant species mean traits to date.

Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) contains abundant antioxidants and essential 
oils which can provide antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities in 
the pharmaceutical, health and food production industry. To improve the economic 
values of coriander, the relationships between optimal light treatments for 
maximizing both plant growth and the antioxidant and essential oil content of 
coriander leaves need to be determined. Plants were exposed to five 
light-emitting diodes spectral color mixtures, high blue light (BL) intensity 
induced the levels of reducing power response. The light treatments were then 
adjusted for the analysis of secondary metabolite compounds of coriander leaves. 
Among 30 identified compounds, the amounts of decamethyl-cyclopentasiloxane and 
dodecane were significantly reduced in the R80 + G50 + B50 condition, whereas 
dodecamethyl-cyclohexasiloxane level was significantly reduced in 
R50 + G50 + B80 condition. Various light quality and intensity combinations 
influenced the accumulations of chlorophyll and phytochemical contents, mediated 
antioxidative properties, and secondary metabolites of coriander leaves, which 
may be useful in developing a new LED lighting apparatus optimized for coriander 
production in plant factories.

It has been established that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role 
in various cancer types, and there are vast numbers of long noncoding RNA 
transcripts that have been identified by high-throughput methods. However, the 
biological function of many novel aberrantly expressed lncRNAs remains poorly 
elucidated, especially in gastric cancer (GC). Here, we first identified a novel 
lncRNA termed LENGA (Low Expression Noncoding RNA in Gastric Adenocarcinoma), 
which was significantly downregulated in GC tissues compared to adjacent normal 
tissues. Next, we found that reduced expression of LENGA in GC was also 
associated with a shorter life expectancy. The proliferation, migration, and 
invasion of GC cells were increased after LENGA knockdown but restrained after 
LENGA overexpression in vitro and in vivo. It was further demonstrated that 
LENGA physically binds to BRD7 (bromodomain-containing 7) in the bromodomain 
domain and acts as a scaffold that enhances the interaction between BRD7 and 
TP53 (tumor protein p53), regulating the expression of a subset of genes in the 
p53 pathway, including CDKN1A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) and PCDH7 
(protocadherin 7), at the transcriptional level. Consistently, the expression of 
CDKN1A has a positive correlation with LENGA in GC patients. Taken together, 
this study uncovers a novel tumor suppressor lncRNA, LENGA, and describes its 
biological function, molecular mechanism, and clinical significance. This 
highlights the potential importance of targeting the LENGA/BRD7/TP53 axis in GC 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are 
at risk for multimorbidity as life expectancy increases. Simulation models can 
project population sizes and age distributions to assist with health policy 
planning.
METHODS: We populated the CEPAC-US model with CDC data to project the HIV 
epidemic among MSM in the United States. The PEARL model was predominantly 
informed by NA-ACCORD data (20092017). We compared projected population sizes 
and age distributions of MSM receiving ART (20212031) and investigated how 
parameters and assumptions affected results.
RESULTS: We projected an aging and increasing population of MSM on ART: 
CEPAC-US, mean age 48.6 (SD 13.7) years in 2021 versus 53.9 (SD 15.0) years in 
2031; PEARL, 46.7 (SD 13.2) years versus 49.2 (SD 14.6) years. We projected 548 
800 MSM on ART (147 020 65 years) in 2031 (CEPAC-US) and 599 410 (113 400 65 
years) (PEARL). Compared with PEARL, CEPAC-US projected a smaller population of 
MSM on ART by 2031 and a slower increase in population size, driven by higher 
estimates of disengagement in care and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from two structurally distinct microsimulation models 
suggest that the MSM population receiving ART in the United States will increase 
and age over the next decade. Subgroup-specific data regarding engagement in 
care and mortality can improve projections and inform health care policy 
planning.
