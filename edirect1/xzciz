[Research progress in pharmacological effects of Uncaria Hook on Alzheimer 
disease models].

[Article in Chinese]

Liu L, Zhao YH, Zeng CQ, Zeng Y.

The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer disease (AD) constitutes 
the majority of all senile dementia cases. Extending life expectancy contributes 
to the increased incidence of AD, which is a serious threat to the quality of 
life of the elderly. The etiology and pathogenesis of AD are not absolutely 
clear. There are various kinds of hypotheses, such as abnormal phosphorylation 
of tau proteins, amyloid-beta protein toxicity, gene mutation, degeneration of 
cholinergic system, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress. Based on the 
above-mentioned theories, lots of studies of Uncaria Hook have been conducted in 
Alzheimer disease models. In this paper, we reviewed the latest research of 
Uncaria Hook on Alzheimer disease models to provide reference for further 
development of Uncaria Hook’s medicinal potential.

Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can markedly affect the growth, 
development, reproduction and behavior of herbivorous insects, mainly by 
changing the primary and secondary metabolites of their host plants. However, 
little is known about the host-selection behavior and the respective intrinsic 
mechanism of sap-sucking insects in response to elevated CO2. In this 
experiment, the host-selection behavior, as well as the physiological mechanism 
based on the analysis of growth, development and energy substances, and the 
expression of the olfactory-related genes of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, 
were studied under ambient (407.0 ± 4.3 μl/L) and elevated (810.5 ± 7.2 μl/L) 
CO2. The results indicated that the aphids reared under ambient and elevated CO2 
did not differ in their level of preference for cotton seedlings, whatever the 
CO2 conditions in which the plants developed. However, aphids reared under 
elevated CO2 showed a greater ability to respond to the plant volatiles compared 
to aphids that developed under ambient CO2 (+23.3%). This suggests that rising 
atmospheric CO2 enhances the activity of host selection in this aphid. Compared 
with ambient CO2, elevated CO2 significantly increased aphid body weight 
(+36.7%) and the contents of glycogen (+18.9%), body fat (+14.6%), and amino 
acids (+16.8%) and increased the expression of odor-binding protein genes, OBP2 
(+299.6%) and OBP7 (+47.4%), and chemosensory protein genes, CSP4 (+265.3%) and 
CSP6 (+50.9%), potentially enhancing the overall life activities and 
upregulating the olfactory ability of A. gossypii. We speculated that the rising 
atmospheric CO2 level would likely aggravate the damage caused by A. gossypii 
due to the higher potential host selection and increased general activity under 
future climate change.

Patients with schizophrenia have significantly greater mortality rates than the 
general population, with an estimated reduced lifespan of 10-20 years. We 
previously reported on a link between impairment in cognition and premature 
death in a prospective 20-year study. Patients who had died prematurely showed 
neurocognitive impairment in nine different cognitive tests compared to those 
who did not. Based on those findings, in this study the surviving patients in 
the cohort were divided into three different groups based on neurocognitive 
impairment and compared on symptom severity including remission status, RAND-36, 
weight and BMI at onset of illness and baseline of the study, and 
medical/physical symptomatology (i.e., blood pressure, symptom awareness, 
vertigo and orthostatic symptoms). Differences were most prominent between the 
cognitively unimpaired and severely cognitively impaired (SCI) groups, with 
remission, negative symptoms, general symptoms and PANSS total scores differing. 
For SF-36 (RAND) Physical functioning and Role limitations due to physical 
health subscales the SCI were worst. The findings indicate that greater 
impairments in cognitive ability during the illness are associated with several 
potential indicators of risk for early mortality. Together these factors may be 
of guidance for establishing an algorithm to detect patients at risk of 
premature death early in their illness.

BACKGROUND: The optimal long-term dosing strategy for adalimumab (ADA) in 
hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa (HS) was evaluated by pooling the results 
of the PIONEER phase 3 trials and an open-label extension (OLE) study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the response to and tolerability of long-term 
administration of ADA in HS.
METHODS: The durations of the PIONEER I/II periods A, B, and OLE were 12, 24, 
and 52 or more weeks, respectively. Patients who entered the OLE and received 
ADA (40 mg every week continuously) and responders plus partial responders 
(PRRs) were evaluated. Primary efficacy assessments included measurement of HS 
clinical response (HiSCR), lesion counts, skin pain, and Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI). Treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed.
RESULTS: At week 12, 52.3% of those receiving ADA weekly and 73.0% of PRRs 
achieved HiSCR. Achievement of HiSCR was maintained through week 168 in 52.3% of 
patients who received ADA weekly and 57.1% of PRRs. Sustained improvement in 
lesion counts, skin pain, and DLQI score were also observed. The safety profile 
throughout the OLE was similar to the profiles observed in the PIONEER studies.
LIMITATIONS: The OLE was uncontrolled.
CONCLUSION: Continuous weekly dosing with ADA, 40 mg, is a reasonable treatment 
option for long-term control of moderate-to-severe HS.

    Cancer. 2018 Oct 15;124(20):3960-3961.

IMPORTANCE: The increasing burden due to cancer and other noncommunicable 
diseases poses a threat to human development, which has resulted in global 
political commitments reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals as well as 
the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan on Non-Communicable 
Diseases. To determine if these commitments have resulted in improved cancer 
control, quantitative assessments of the cancer burden are required.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden for 29 cancer groups over time to provide a 
framework for policy discussion, resource allocation, and research focus.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years 
of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were evaluated for 195 
countries and territories by age and sex using the Global Burden of Disease 
study estimation methods. Levels and trends were analyzed over time, as well as 
by the Sociodemographic Index (SDI). Changes in incident cases were categorized 
by changes due to epidemiological vs demographic transition.
FINDINGS: In 2016, there were 17.2 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.9 
million deaths. Cancer cases increased by 28% between 2006 and 2016. The 
smallest increase was seen in high SDI countries. Globally, population aging 
contributed 17%; population growth, 12%; and changes in age-specific rates, -1% 
to this change. The most common incident cancer globally for men was prostate 
cancer (1.4 million cases). The leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs was 
tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (1.2 million deaths and 25.4 million DALYs). 
For women, the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer 
deaths and DALYs was breast cancer (1.7 million incident cases, 535 000 deaths, 
and 14.9 million DALYs). In 2016, cancer caused 213.2 million DALYs globally for 
both sexes combined. Between 2006 and 2016, the average annual age-standardized 
incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 130 of 195 countries or 
territories, and the average annual age-standardized death rates decreased 
within that timeframe in 143 of 195 countries or territories.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Large disparities exist between countries in cancer 
incidence, deaths, and associated disability. Scaling up cancer prevention and 
ensuring universal access to cancer care are required for health equity and to 
fulfill the global commitments for noncommunicable disease and cancer control.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major health concern in patients with HIV 
infection in endemic areas of VL. In these areas, a substantial number of 
infected individuals are asymptomatic and the risk of acute VL infection in 
HIV/VL co-infected cases is high. The current study aimed to determine the 
prevalence of asymptomatic VL infection among HIV-infected patients in Fars 
province, southern Iran. Subjects of the study were 251 HIV-confirmed patients 
who all were clinically asymptomatic for leishmaniasis. Blood samples were 
obtained from each participant. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in the 
sera using ELISA. DNA was extracted from the buffy coat of each subject and PCR 
amplified, targeting an ITS-2 gene of Leishmania. PCR products were purified 
from the gel and were sequenced. Overall, 19 out of 251 (7.6%) HIV-infected 
patients were found to be infected with Leishmania, using serological or 
molecular methods. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected in 13 (5.2%) 
patients and leishmanial DNA in 8 (3.2%) of the patients. The sequence analysis 
of DNA-positive cases revealed the species of the parasite as L. infantum. The 
high prevalence of VL among the patients with HIV is a serious challenge which 
demands further attention to improve the prophylaxis and treatment measurements 
of VL/HIV co-infection and thereby promoting the life expectancy and quality of 
life of these patients.

[Multimorbidity of elderly persons in urban and rural areas of the Nizhny 
Novgorod region.].

The article compares the prevalence of pathological changes in different organs 
and systems among city and rural residents of the next ages: elderly (60-74 
years for men and 55-74 years for women), senile (75-84 years) and advanced (85 
years and older) ages. The results of the continuous survey of all persons of 
the retirement age of one urban (7 809 people) and two rural areas (14 749) of 
the Nizhny Novgorod region were analyzed. The region is comparatively 
homogeneous in terms of the national composition of the population. In the city, 
the number of chronic pathologies of different organs and systems per one person 
of elderly age are: 2,83 for man and 2,76 for woman of elderly ages, 3,06 and 
3,07 respectively for senile ages, 2,71 and 2,75 of advanced ages. In rural 
areas, the analyzed indicators for men and women are respectively 1,64 and 1,58 
for elderly ages, 1,84 and 1,78 for senile ages, 1,86 and 1,84 for advanced 
ages. Demonstrating the difference in the phenotypic manifestations of the genes 
of predisposition to chronic diseases in old age between the city and village, 
the results make it possible to produce the following assumptions. First, better 
access to medical care does not guarantee the better health status of the 
elderly, while it contributes to an increase in the life expectancy of men. 
Second, in spite of better access to health care, urban lifestyle contributes to 
the accumulation of chronic diseases in population of a region. Third, if 
chronic pathology of three different classes of diseases presented, then the 
probability of a long life is fundamentally determined by the access to health 
care. Fourth, the probability of longevity is significantly reduced in result of 
illness by neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine or genitourinary 
diseases in ages of working or beginning of retirement period.

Publisher: В статье проведено сравнение распространенности патологических 
изменений в разных органах и системах у жителей города и села пожилого (60–74 
года для мужчин и 55–74 года для женщин), старческого (75–84 года) и преклонного 
(85 лет и старше) возраста. Проанализированы результаты сплошного обследования 
всех лиц пенсионного возраста одного городского (7 809 человек) и двух сельских 
районов (14 749) Нижегородской области, сравнительно однородной по национальному 
составу населения. В городе число хронических патологий разных органов и систем, 
приходящихся на одного пенсионера пожилого возраста, составляет 2,83 на одного 
мужчину и 2,76 на одну женщину, старческого возраста — 3,06 и 3,07 
соответственно, преклонного возраста — 2,71 и 2,75. В сельских районах 
анализируемый показатель для мужчин и женщин пожилого возраста составляет 1,64 и 
1,58 соответственно, старческого возраста — 1,84 и 1,78, преклонного возраста — 
1,86 и 1,84. Демонстрируя различие фенотипических проявлений генов 
предрасположенности к хроническим заболеваниям в старости в городе и селе, 
полученные результаты позволяют сделать следующие предположения. Во-первых, 
лучший доступ к медицинской помощи не гарантирует лучшее состояние здоровья 
пожилых, однако способствует увеличению продолжительности жизни мужчин. 
Во-вторых, несмотря на лучшую доступность медицинской помощи, городской образ 
жизни способствует накоплению у населения региона хронических заболеваний. 
В-третьих, при наличии хронических заболеваний трех разных классов болезней 
вероятность долгой жизни принципиальным образом определяется доступностью 
медицинской помощи. В-четвертых, вероятность дожития до преклонного возраста 
существенно снижается в результате заболевания в трудоспособном или раннем 
пенсионном возрасте сердечно-сосудистыми патологиями, новообразованиями, 
болезнями органов дыхания, эндокринной и мочеполовой систем.

Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the novel all-oral direct-acting 
antiviral regimen daclatasvir + asunaprevir (DUAL), versus interferon-based 
regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b infection. 
Methods: Inputs for a lifetime Markov model were sourced from clinical trials 
and published literature. Outputs include disease management costs, life 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity 
analyses assessed the drivers of cost-effectiveness and sustained virologic 
response thresholds at which DUAL is cost-saving. Results: DUAL was associated 
with discounted incremental quality-adjusted life-years of 1.29-3.85 and 
incremental life-years of 0.85-2.59 per patient, with discounted lifetime cost 
savings of USD$1415-8525. Associated sustained virologic response rates could 
fall to 45.1-84.8%, while remaining dominant. Conclusion: Treatment with DUAL 
provides significant clinical benefit, while accruing lower lifetime costs.

BACKGROUND: Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular 
emergency. The mortality from emergency endovascular repair may be much lower 
than the 40-50% reported for open surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether or not a strategy of endovascular repair compared 
with open repair reduces 30-day and mid-term mortality (including costs and 
cost-effectiveness) among patients with a suspected ruptured AAA.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial, with computer-generated telephone 
randomisation of participants in a 1 : 1 ratio, using variable block size, 
stratified by centre and without blinding.
SETTING: Vascular centres in the UK (n = 29) and Canada (n = 1) between 2009 and 
2013.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 613 eligible participants (480 men) with a ruptured 
aneurysm, clinically diagnosed at the trial centre.
INTERVENTIONS: A total of 316 participants were randomised to the endovascular 
strategy group (immediate computerised tomography followed by endovascular 
repair if anatomically suitable or, if not suitable, open repair) and 297 were 
randomised to the open repair group (computerised tomography optional).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality, with 
30-day reinterventions, costs and disposal as early secondary outcome measures. 
Later outcome measures included 1- and 3-year mortality, reinterventions, 
quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 35.4% in the endovascular strategy group and 
37.4% in the open repair group [odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.66 to 1.28; p = 0.62, and, after adjustment for age, sex and Hardman 
index, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.33]. The endovascular strategy appeared to be 
more effective in women than in men (interaction test p = 0.02). More discharges 
in the endovascular strategy group (94%) than in the open repair group (77%) 
were directly to home (p < 0.001). Average 30-day costs were similar between 
groups, with the mean difference in costs being -£1186 (95% CI -£2997 to £625), 
favouring the endovascular strategy group. After 1 year, survival and 
reintervention rates were similar in the two groups, QoL (at both 3 and 12 
months) was higher in the endovascular strategy group and the mean cost 
difference was -£2329 (95% CI -£5489 to £922). At 3 years, mortality was 48% and 
56% in the endovascular strategy group and open repair group, respectively (OR 
0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00; p = 0.053), with a stronger benefit for the 
endovascular strategy in the subgroup of 502 participants in whom repair was 
started for a proven rupture (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89; p = 0.009), whereas 
aneurysm-related reintervention rates were non-significantly higher in this 
group. At 3 years, considering all participants, there was a mean difference of 
0.174 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% CI 0.002 to 0.353 QALYs) and, 
among the endovascular strategy group, a cost difference of -£2605 (95% CI 
-£5966 to £702), leading to 88% of estimates in the cost-effectiveness plane 
being in the quadrant showing the endovascular strategy to be 'dominant'.
LIMITATIONS: Because of the pragmatic design of this trial, 33 participants in 
the endovascular strategy group and 26 in the open repair group breached 
randomisation allocation.
CONCLUSIONS: The endovascular strategy was not associated with a significant 
reduction in either 30-day mortality or cost but was associated with faster 
participant recovery. By 3 years, the endovascular strategy showed a survival 
and QALY gain and was highly likely to be cost-effective. Future research could 
include improving resuscitation for older persons with circulatory collapse, the 
impact of local anaesthesia and emergency consent procedures.

BACKGROUND: Evidence is scarce on the efficacy of long-term human albumin (HA) 
administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The human Albumin for 
the treatmeNt of aScites in patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) study was 
designed to clarify this issue.
METHODS: We did an investigator-initiated multicentre randomised, parallel, 
open-label, pragmatic trial in 33 academic and non-academic Italian hospitals. 
We randomly assigned patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites who were 
treated with anti-aldosteronic drugs (≥200 mg/day) and furosemide (≥25 mg/day) 
to receive either standard medical treatment (SMT) or SMT plus HA (40 g twice 
weekly for 2 weeks, and then 40 g weekly) for up to 18 months. The primary 
endpoint was 18-month mortality, evaluated as difference of events and analysis 
of survival time in patients included in the modified intention-to-treat and 
per-protocol populations. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 
2008-000625-19, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01288794.
FINDINGS: From April 2, 2011, to May 27, 2015, 440 patients were randomly 
assigned and 431 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 38 
of 218 patients died in the SMT plus HA group and 46 of 213 in the SMT group. 
Overall 18-month survival was significantly higher in the SMT plus HA than in 
the SMT group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 77% vs 66%; p=0·028), resulting in a 38% 
reduction in the mortality hazard ratio (0·62 [95% CI 0·40-0·95]). 46 (22%) 
patients in the SMT group and 49 (22%) in the SMT plus HA group had grade 3-4 
non-liver related adverse events.
INTERPRETATION: In this trial, long-term HA administration prolongs overall 
survival and might act as a disease modifying treatment in patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: In asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative mitral valve 
regurgitation (MR), early surgery is often performed in experienced centers. The 
patient- and valve-related results and the quality of life after surgery in 
these patients remain insufficiently explored.
METHODS: Between 1/2000 and 12/2015, 83 asymptomatic patients (mean age 
56.6±12.6 years, 21 female) without any complications related to long-lasting MR 
underwent early surgery. Follow-up clinical and echocardiographic data and 
health-related quality of life assessment (SF-36) were studied and matched to 
the general population.
RESULTS: Repair rate was 100% and early mortality was 0%. Residual MR (≥grade 
2+) was seen in 1 (1%) patient who underwent a successful re-repair while 4 (5%) 
patients needed permanent pacemaker implantation. At a median follow-up of 7.6 
(IQR 4.1-11.9) years, 6 late deaths occurred. The 10-year overall survival rate 
was 91.5% (95% CI 84.2-98.8%) and was comparable to the general population. The 
health-related quality of life (84% complete) did not differ from the general 
population. One patient underwent late reintervention. Median echocardiography 
follow-up was 5.2 years (IQR 2.4-10.4; 98% complete). The 10-year freedom from 
recurrent MR rate (≥grade 2+) was 86.7% (95% CI 76.1-97.3%). The 10-year freedom 
from any atrial tachycardia rate was 68.7% (95% CI 55.2-82.2%) while 7 (8%) 
patients underwent late pacemaker implantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe MR 
can be performed safely and restores normal life expectancy and quality of life. 
However, the frequency of late arrhythmias and pacemaker implantation is high 
and needs further evaluation.

The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the six ligaments in the human knee 
joint that provides stability during articulations. It is relatively prone to 
acute and chronic injuries as compared to other ligaments. Repair and 
self-healing of an injured anterior cruciate ligament are time-consuming 
processes. For personnel resuming an active sports life, surgical repair or 
replacement is essential. Untreated anterior cruciate ligament tear results 
frequently in osteoarthritis. Therefore, understanding of the biomechanics of 
injury and properties of the native ligament is crucial. An abridged summary of 
the prominent literature with a focus on key topics on kinematics and kinetics 
of the knee joint and various loads acting on the anterior cruciate ligament as 
a function of flexion angle is presented here with an emphasis on the gaps. 
Briefly, we also review mechanical characterization composition and anatomy of 
the anterior cruciate ligament as well as graft materials used for 
replacement/reconstruction surgeries. The key conclusions of this review are as 
follows: (a) the highest shear forces on the anterior cruciate ligament occur 
during hyperextension/low flexion angles of the knee joint; (b) the 
characterization of the anterior cruciate ligament at variable strain rates is 
critical to model a viscoelastic behavior; however, studies on human anterior 
cruciate ligament on variable strain rates are yet to be reported; (c) a 
significant disparity on maximum stress/strain pattern of the anterior cruciate 
ligament was observed in the earlier works; (d) nearly all synthetic grafts have 
been recalled from the market; and (e) bridge-enhanced repair developed by 
Murray is a promising technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 
currently in clinical trials. It is important to note that full extension of the 
knee is not feasible in the case of most animals and hence the loading pattern 
of human ACL is different from animal models. Many of the published reviews on 
the ACL focus largely on animal ACL than human ACL. Further, this review article 
summarizes the issues with autografts and synthetic grafts used so far.
