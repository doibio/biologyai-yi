BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing pulmonary resection are thought to be at high 
risk for the development of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), and 
these complications may lead to serious morbidity. The purpose of this study was 
to identify the factors associated with postoperative pulmonary complications in 
patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine the effect of PPCs on 
survival.
METHODS: The study involved a retrospective review of 635 patients who had 
undergone curative resection for lung cancer. The patient group included 504 
males (79.4%), and the overall mean age was 61.3 years. Patients were classified 
as those who had experienced PPCs (PPCs group, n = 105, 16.5%) or those who had 
not (no-PPCs group, n = 530, 83.5%).
RESULTS: The surgical procedures performed were 101 pneumonectomies (15.9%), 505 
lobectomies (79.5%), and 29 lesser resections (4.6%). Cancer types comprised 330 
squamous cell carcinomas (52.0%), 255 adenocarcinomas (40.2%) and 50 others 
(7.8%). Univariate analysis showed that the following factors were predictors 
for PPCs: male sex, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, preoperative serum 
fibrinogen level, pulmonary function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
smoking, double primary cancer, and surgical duration. Multivariate logistic 
regression showed that preoperative serum fibrinogen level (p < 0.001), surgical 
duration (p < 0.0001) and being male (p = 0.02) were significant predictors of 
PPCs. Overall survival 3 years after surgery was 68.2% in no-PPCs group and 
38.8% in PPCs group (p < 0.0001). Regardless of tumor staging, overall survival 
differed significantly between PPCs and no-PPCs groups, whereas disease-free 
survival did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher preoperative serum fibrinogen levels, longer surgical 
duration, and being male were the predictive factors for PPCs in surgical 
candidates. The development of PPCs was linked to a shortened overall survival.

BACKGROUND: Patients with early stage nonsmall-cell lung cancer who have 
undergone complete resection have a recurrence rate of approximately 50%, 
predominately due to the development of systemic metastases. This study is a 
prospective analysis of the expression of seven serum protein markers of 
invasion and metastasis, collected preoperatively (baseline) and serially after 
resection, to determine the relationship between marker expression and 
recurrence.
METHODS: Serum was collected from 196 patients with clinical stage I 
nonsmall-cell lung cancer who underwent resection over a 5-year period (1996 to 
2000). Samples were drawn before resection and 1, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months 
postoperatively. All patients were followed for at least 24 months or until 
death. Serum protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte 
growth factor), E-selectin, CD44, basic fibroblast growth factor, urokinase 
plasminogen activator, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor were 
determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: To date, 73 patients (37%) have demonstrated recurrence. Baseline 
levels of only 1 marker (CD44) correlated with pathologic stage (p = 0.02). 
Analysis of the serial samples demonstrated that recurrence was predicted 
(before clinical or radiographic determination) by decreasing levels of 
E-selectin (p = 0.002), increasing levels of CD44 (p = 0.001), and increasing 
levels of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential to predict recurrence after 
resection in patients with early-stage nonsmall-cell lung cancer using a panel 
of serum protein markers. Early identification of patients with recurrence may 
improve the efficacy of systemic therapy.

BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinoma (AC) is the most common lung cancer, followed by 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Controversy exists concerning both cell types. 
Our purpose was to compare their prognosis after resection and determine whether 
AC subtyping may have any significance.
METHODS: From 1993 to 2002, 574 patients with SCC and 565 with AC underwent a 
curative resection and were compared according to sex, age, type of resection, 
TNM system classification, and survival. One hundred fifty-nine patients with 
ACs demonstrated a pure histologic pattern according to the 1999 World Health 
Organization classification, and 406 were of the mixed subtype including cell 
types with potentially different aggressiveness. Therefore, we compared 
subgroups according to presence or not of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or solid 
adenocarcinoma with mucin component, or both.
RESULTS: Compared with ACs, SCCs had a higher number of males and older 
patients, and incidences of endobronchial tumors, pneumonectomies, and stage II 
tumors were higher. Global survival rates were not different. The ACs with solid 
AC with mucin components (n = 239) were characterized by more males and stage 
IIB patients, and had poorer survival rates (38.6% vs 61.4%; p < 0.0014) than 
the ACs without solid AC with mucin component. When comparing these with SCCs, 
5-year survival rates were: ACs without solid AC with mucin component (58.1%), 
SCCs (50.2%), and ACs with solid AC with mucin component (36.8%) (p < 0.000019). 
Multivariate analysis demonstrated these subgroups and SCCs to be independent 
factors of prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Solid ACs with a mucin component demonstrated the poorest prognosis 
after resection. Further studies of this cell type, which should be looked for 
carefully, may help improve targetting adjuvant therapies.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the early outcome of patients 
with poor lung function who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) 
pulmonary resection for primary non-small cell lung carcinoma.
METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the records of patients with lung cancer 
undergoing VATS lung resection over a period of 5 years. Twenty-five patients 
with preoperative poor lung function defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 
second less than 0.8 L or the percentage predicted value for forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second less than 50% were identified. Thirteen patients underwent 
VATS lobectomies and 12 VATS wedge resections. Data were analyzed with respect 
to demographics, risk factors, and early postoperative outcome and survival.
RESULTS: There were 8 cases of morbidities (29%) and no surgical mortality. Five 
of these 8 patients had respiratory-related complications after surgery. A 
deterioration in pulmonary performance as indicated by the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) score was seen in 7 patients (28%), with only 1 patient 
having an ECOG score greater than 2. No patient required home oxygen 
supplementation beyond the third month postoperatively. After a median follow-up 
period of 15.1 months (range, 1 to 24), 5 patients died. Only 1 patient (4%) 
died of a respiratory complication (pneumonia 6 weeks after surgery). The other 
4 deaths were due to recurrent or metastatic disease. The actuarial survival 
rates at 1 and 2 years were 80% and 69%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thoracic surgery pulmonary resection for cancer in 
patients with poor lung function can achieve acceptable functional and oncologic 
outcome.

BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding long-term survival after 
pulmonary metastasectomy for gynecologic malignancies.
METHODS: All patients who underwent pulmonary resection for gynecologic 
malignancies at our institution between January 1985 and June 2001 were 
reviewed. Factors affecting long-term survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 103 patients, 70 of whom had metastatic disease limited to 
the lungs. Median age of these 70 patients was 59.4 years (range, 31 to 80 
years). The primary tumor originated in the uterine corpus in 37 patients, 
endometrium in 23, cervix in 7, ovaries in 2, and vagina in 1. Histopathology 
was leiomyosarcoma in 29 patients, adenocarcinoma in 23, other sarcoma in 11, 
squamous cell carcinoma in 5, and choriocarcinoma and endolymphatic stromal 
myosis in 1 each. The median time interval between the first gynecologic 
procedure and pulmonary resection was 24 months (range, 0 to 237 months). A 
wedge excision was performed in 44 patients, lobectomy in 14, bilobectomy in 2, 
pneumonectomy in 1, and a combination in 9. Five patients (7%) had an incomplete 
resection. Eighteen patients (25.7%) developed at least one complication and 1 
died (operative mortality, 1.4%). At last follow-up, 35 had died, and the median 
follow-up among those who were still alive was 36 months (range, 6 months to 13 
years). Five-year and 10-year survival was 46.8% (95% confidence interval, 34.2% 
to 63.0%) and 34.3% (95% confidence interval, 19.7% to 52.5%), respectively. 
Factors that adversely affected survival include a disease-free interval between 
the first gynecologic procedure and pulmonary resection of less than 24 months 
(p = 0.004) and a primary site located in the cervix (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection for metastatic gynecologic cancer in selected 
patients is safe and effective. Both a short disease-free interval between the 
primary gynecologic procedure and pulmonary metastasectomy, and a primary 
cervical tumor had an adverse effect on survival.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we analyze our experience with pulmonary resection 
for metastases from colorectal carcinoma. The aims were to search for factors 
influencing prognosis and to investigate the presence of microsatellite 
instability in the primary tumors and the corresponding lung metastases.
METHODS: We identified 81 patients who underwent surgical resection between 1991 
and 2004. The microsatellite instability was determined by immunohistochemical 
evaluation of MSH2 and MLH1 in 117 lesions (41 primary tumors and 76 lung 
metastases).
RESULTS: Overall 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 50%, 42%, and 30%, 
respectively. Univariate analysis showed that stage of the primary tumor (p = 
0.037), radicalness of the resection (p = 0.019), and stratification into groups 
according to the International Registry of Lung Metastases classification (p = 
0.039) were prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis showed that stage of the 
primary tumor (p = 0.030) and the radicalness of the resection (p = 0.014) were 
independent prognostic factors. All tumors displayed preserved expression of 
MSH2 and MLH1 and were considered microsatellite stable lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection of metastases from colorectal carcinoma results 
in long-term survival in selected patients. Complete resection, stage of the 
primary tumor and stratification into groups according to the International 
Registry of Lung Metastases classification were prognostic factors. All the 
metastases and the corresponding primary tumors were microsatellite stable 
lesions. This finding seems to demonstrate that pulmonary metastases are 
infrequent in colorectal carcinomas with microsatellite instability.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality 
in patients with Marfan syndrome. Many patients with presumed Marfan syndrome do 
not meet current diagnostic criteria. This study reviews the surgical aspects of 
aortic disease in 300 patients referred with the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.
METHODS: During a 16-year period, 300 patients with presumed Marfan syndrome 
underwent 398 operations on the aorta and branch arteries, including 125 aortic 
root operations, 59 aortic arch repairs, 31 descending thoracic aortic repairs, 
and 178 thoracoabdominal aortic repairs. Based on medical record review, 
patients were classified as confirmed Marfan syndrome if documented features 
satisfied current diagnostic criteria; patients not meeting these criteria were 
classified as suspected Marfan syndrome.
RESULTS: There were 17 operative deaths (4.3%) after the 398 operations. 
Survival after the initial referral operation was 96.2% +/- 1.5% at 1 year, 
82.7% +/- 2.4% at 5 years, and 74.6% +/- 3.1% at 10 years. Presentations, 
operative details, and outcomes were remarkably similar in the 137 patients 
(45.7%) with confirmed Marfan syndrome and the 163 patients (54.3%) with 
suspected Marfan syndrome. Freedom from repair failure, however, was 
significantly better in patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome (90.3% +/- 2.3% 
at 10 years) than in those with suspected Marfan syndrome (82.0% +/- 3.1% at 10 
years; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment of the full spectrum of aortic disease in 
Marfan patients enables excellent long-term survival. Similarities in surgical 
aspects of aortic disease suggest that patients with features of Marfan syndrome 
who do not meet diagnostic criteria should be managed in the same manner as 
patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome.

BACKGROUND: This study analyzes retrospectively a cohort of patients with 
ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction < or = 0.30) who underwent isolated 
coronary artery bypass grafting to evaluate the impact of no-to-moderate mitral 
regurgitation (MR) on long-term results.
METHODS: From January 1988 to December 2002, 6,108 patients had isolated 
coronary artery bypass grafting. Two hundred thirty-nine (3.9%) had ischemic 
cardiomyopathy; 60 patients had no, 102 had mild, and 77 had moderate MR. Using 
propensity score, a group of 70 patients with no or mild MR (group A) was 
case-matched with a group of 70 patients with moderate MR (group B) to obtain 
two groups with similar preoperative characteristics.
RESULTS: Nine patients (6.4%) died within the first 30 days; all deaths were 
cardiac-related. There was no difference in the early results between groups. 
Patients in group B showed lower freedom from death, from cardiac death, from 
cardiac death and ischemic events, and from death and New York Heart Association 
class III and IV than patients in group A. Cox analysis confirmed that moderate 
MR was an independent variable for worse late outcome in this subgroup of 
patients. Functional and echocardiographic results, after a mean of 62 +/- 28 
months in 87.8% of survivors, showed a significant impairment of New York Heart 
Association class (from 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 2.8 +/- 0.6; p < 0.001) and MR degree 
(from 2.0 to 2.7 +/- 1.0; p = 0.023) in patients with preoperative moderate MR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that moderate ischemic MR has an important 
negative impact on survival and quality of life of patients with severely 
impaired left ventricular function, treated by coronary artery bypass grafting 
alone.

Natural history of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and 
right-ventricle-dependent coronary circulation managed by the single-ventricle 
approach.

Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

BACKGROUND: Long-term outcome of patients with pulmonary valvar atresia and 
intact ventricular septum with right-ventricle-dependent coronary circulation 
(PA/IVS-RVDCC) managed by staged palliation directed toward Fontan circulation 
is unknown, but should serve as a basis for comparison with management protocols 
that include initial systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunting followed by listing 
for cardiac transplantation.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients admitted to our institution with the 
diagnosis of PA/IVS-RVDCC from 1989 to 2004. All angiographic imaging studies, 
operative reports, and follow-up information were reviewed. 
Right-ventricle-dependent coronary circulation was defined as situations in 
which ventriculocoronary fistulae with proximal coronary stenosis or atresia 
were present, putting significant left ventricle myocardium at risk for ischemia 
with right ventricle decompression.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were identified with PA/IVS-RVDCC. All underwent 
initial palliation with modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS). Median tricuspid 
valve z-score was -3.62 (-2.42 to -5.15), and all had moderate (n = 13) or 
severe (n = 19) right ventricular hypoplasia. Median follow-up was 5.1 years (9 
months to 14.8 years). Overall mortality was 18.8% (6 of 32), with all deaths 
occurring within 3 months of BTS. Aortocoronary atresia was associated with 100% 
mortality (3 of 3). Of the survivors (n = 26), 19 have undergone Fontan 
operation whereas 7, having undergone bidirectional Glenn shunt, currently await 
Fontan. Actuarial survival by the Kaplan-Meier method for all patients was 81.3% 
at 5, 10, and 15 years, whereas mean survival was 12.1 years (95% confidence 
interval: 10.04 to 14.05). No late mortality occurred among those surviving 
beyond 3 months of age.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PA/IVS-RVDCC, early mortality appears related to 
coronary ischemia at the time of BTS. Single-ventricle palliation yields 
excellent long-term survival and should be the preferred management strategy for 
these patients. Those with aortocoronary atresia have a particularly poor 
prognosis and should undergo cardiac transplantation.

We survey Indigenous health issues across the Pacific with a case study approach 
that focuses on Australia, New Zealand, Hawai'i, and US Associated Micronesia. 
For each case study, we provide an overview of the Indigenous population, its 
colonial history, and current health and social outcomes. In the discussion that 
follows, we flag some of the key policy initiatives that have been developed to 
address Indigenous health disadvantage, albeit within the context of continuing 
debates about Indigenous rights and policy.

Science Center, San Antonio, TX 78229-3900, USA. masoro@aol.com

It is concluded that dietary restriction will extend the life of all species in 
the Animalia Kingdom, including the human species. This conclusion is based on 
the fact that hormesis is a component of the life-extending action and the other 
anti-aging effects of dietary restriction. It is also concluded that given the 
currently available database, it is not possible to predict the quantitative 
effect of dietary restriction on the human life span.

Health span extension by later-life caloric or dietary restriction: a view based 
on rodent studies.

University, Funabashi, Chiba 274-8510, Japan. goto@phar.toho-u.ac.jp

In spite of the potential benefit of lifelong food restriction to retard aging 
and extend life span, it is unrealistic in human. The restriction late in life 
may be more practical. There are, however, only limited studies on the effect of 
late onset caloric or dietary restriction. We and other investigators have shown 
that the late life restriction rejuvenates some parameters that decline with age 
in rats and mice. Although such studies may provide a basis for human 
application of late-life caloric or dietary restriction, the prolongation of 
maximum life span would not be expected in view of the current status of the 
long-lived population in which maximum life span potential appears to have 
already been achieved. The late life caloric restriction, however, could extend 
the health span if the extent were appropriate.

BACKGROUND: In the late 1970s, the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health identified two shoe manufacturing facilities where workers 
experienced relatively "pure" exposures to toluene. A mortality study was 
conducted through December 31, 1982. An original study did not detect elevated 
leukemia mortality but did detect increased lung cancer mortality. The present 
study is an update of the mortality of the original cohort.
METHODS: The study cohort consisted of workers employed 1 month or more between 
1940 and 1979 at two Ohio shoe manufacturing plants. Vital status was 
ascertained through December 31, 1999.
RESULTS: Seven thousand eight hundred twenty eight workers, contributing 300,777 
person years, were available for analysis. An excess of lung cancer deaths 
persisted with additional years of follow-up (SMR = 1.36, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) = 1.19-1.54). Trend tests did not indicate a positive trend 
between lung cancer risk and duration of employment. Mortality from leukemia was 
not significantly elevated in the updated analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a possible association between lung cancer 
mortality and exposure to chronic, low-levels of organic solvents. Although the 
strength of this conclusion was weakened by the lack of increasing lung cancer 
risk in relation to duration of employment, other studies have supported this 
association.

Osteoporosis is a significant public health problem. Vertebral fractures are the 
most common fracture in patients with osteoporosis, occurring in approximately 
750,000 cases each year. The fractures may cause acute or chronic pain, reduce 
the quality of life, and shorten life expectancy. Several medications are 
available that reduce the risk of fracture. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty 
(balloon-inflated expansion of collapsed vertebrae followed by injection of bone 
cement) may reduce or relieve pain in selected patients. Although surgery is 
rarely necessary for the management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, it may 
be indicated for other reasons. No studies have been conducted to determine if 
the outcome of spinal fusion is different in patients with osteoporosis and, if 
it is, whether management of the patient's osteoporosis will improve the 
outcome.

Type 2 diabetes is the main type of diabetes in diabetic population. Along with 
the rapid changes of life style and increased life expectancy, the prevalence of 
type 2 diabetes increases rapidly worldwide. However, strong evidences have 
shown that genetic factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 
diabetes, except for some rare subtypes of type 2 diabetes. The genetic patterns 
of the common forms of type 2 diabetes do not follow the role of classic 
Mendelian inheritance. Therefore, the type 2 diabetes is regarded as a complex 
disease caused by interaction between gene and environment. However, little 
progress has been made during past two decades in the genetic epidemiology of 
type 2 diabetes. This article reviews the current status of genetic epidemiology 
of type 2 diabetes and proposes strategies for future researches.

Brainstem dysfunction resulting from central extension of infection is a 
life-threatening complication of otitis media/interna (OMI) that has been 
described infrequently in dogs and cats. We review the clinical signs of 
disease, diagnostic findings, and results of surgical and medical treatments of 
brainstem disease attributable to otogenic intracranial infection in cats and 
dogs. Eleven cats and 4 dogs were examined because of acute, subacute, or 
chronic clinical signs of brain disease including central vestibular signs, 
altered mentation, abnormal posture/gait, cranial nerve deficits, and seizures. 
Results of a minimal database (CBC, serum biochemical panel, urinalysis, 
thoracic radiographs, and abdominal ultrasonographic images or radiographs) were 
within reference intervals in all animals. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the 
head were acquired for all animals, and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 
9 of 11 cats and 3 of 4 dogs was examined. Surgical exploration and ventral 
bulla osteotomy were done for 12 of 15 animals, followed by 1-3 months of 
antibiotic therapy; the remaining animals were euthanized before treatment. In 
all animals, MR imaging was effective in characterizing the location and extent 
of the pathologic changes intracranially as well as within middle/inner ear 
structures. Results of CSF analysis were characteristic of bacterial infection 
in most of the animals with acute or subacute disease. Since long-term outcome 
in all treated animals was very good to excellent, it was concluded that dogs 
and cats with intracranial disease secondary to extension of otitis 
media/interna have a good-to-excellent prognosis when the condition was 
diagnosed and was treated by surgical exploration and appropriate antibiotic 
therapy.

Morbidity and mortality are classically used to measure disease burden. However, 
the allocation of limited health-care resources demands an agreed rational 
allocation principle and, consequently, the setting of priorities is of 
considerable importance. We collected data from the national death certificate 
database, and the national health insurance claim database and life tables. 
Using this data, we calculated disability adjusted life year (DALY) and health 
life year (HeaLY) values for smoking-related cancer. The burden of cancer due to 
smoking was estimated by multiplying the population attributable risk due to 
smoking by the DALY and HeaLY results for cancers. The burden of cancer due to 
smoking for Korean men was 1930.1 person-years by DALY and 1681.3 person-years 
by HeaLY per 100 000 people. Similarly, the burden of cancer due to smoking for 
Korean women was 352.6 person-years for DALY and 313.6 person-years for HeaLY 
per 100 000 people. Priority rankings for cancer burden due to smoking was 
somewhat different by DALY and HeaLY. The largest health gap for men was stomach 
cancer by DALY and lung cancer by HeaLY, whereas for women it was lung cancer by 
both methods. This study provides a rational basis for national cancer policy 
planning by presenting the priority burden of cancers caused by smoking.

Access to care, health status, and health disparities in the United States and 
Canada: results of a cross-national population-based survey.

Lasser KE(1), Himmelstein DU, Woolhandler S.

(1)Department of Medicine, The Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical 
School, Cambridge, Mass, USA. klasser@challiance.org

OBJECTIVES: We compared health status, access to care, and utilization of 
medical services in the United States and Canada and compared disparities 
according to race, income, and immigrant status.
METHODS: We analyzed population-based data on 3505 Canadian and 5183 US adults 
from the Joint Canada/US Survey of Health. Controlling for gender, age, income, 
race, and immigrant status, we used logistic regression to analyze country as a 
predictor of access to care, quality of care, and satisfaction with care and as 
a predictor of disparities in these measures.
RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, US respondents (compared with Canadians) were 
less likely to have a regular doctor, more likely to have unmet health needs, 
and more likely to forgo needed medicines. Disparities on the basis of race, 
income, and immigrant status were present in both countries but were more 
extreme in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: United States residents are less able to access care than are 
Canadians. Universal coverage appears to reduce most disparities in access to 
care.

The widening gap in mortality by educational level in the Russian Federation, 
1980-2001.

Murphy M(1), Bobak M, Nicholson A, Rose R, Marmot M.

(1)Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political 
Science, London, England. m.murphy@lse.ac.uk

OBJECTIVES: We examined trends in the relation between educational level and 
adult mortality in the Russian Federation in the period 1989 through 2001.
METHODS: We used a convenience cohort based on survey respondents' information 
about age, survival status, and educational level of close relatives, and 
applied modified indirect demographic techniques to stratify mortality rates by 
educational level in the study period. A random sample of 7172 respondents 
(response rate=61%) provided full information on 10440 relatives.
RESULTS: The mortality advantage of better-educated men and women in 1980 
increased substantially by 2001. In 1980, life expectancy at age 20 for 
university-educated men was 3 years greater than for men with elementary 
education only, but was 11 years greater by 2001, reflecting not only declining 
life expectancy in less-educated men but also an improvement among 
better-educated men. Similar patterns were seen in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The well-documented mortality increases seen in Russia after 1990 
have predominantly affected less-educated men and women, whereas the mortality 
of persons with university education has improved, resulting in a sharp increase 
in educational-level mortality differentials.

Societal costs of underage drinking.

Author information:
(1)Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 11710 Beltsville Drive, Suite 
125, Calverton, Maryland 20705-3102, USA. Miller@pire.org

OBJECTIVE: Despite minimum-purchase-age laws, young people regularly drink 
alcohol. This study estimated the magnitude and costs of problems resulting from 
underage drinking by category-traffic crashes, violence, property crime, 
suicide, burns, drownings, fetal alcohol syndrome, high-risk sex, poisonings, 
psychoses, and dependency treatment-and compared those costs with associated 
alcohol sales. Previous studies did not break out costs of alcohol problems by 
age.
METHOD: For each category of alcohol-related problems, we estimated fatal and 
nonfatal cases attributable to underage alcohol use. We multiplied 
alcohol-attributable cases by estimated costs per case to obtain total costs for 
each problem.
RESULTS: Underage drinking accounted for at least 16% of alcohol sales in 2001. 
It led to 3,170 deaths and 2.6 million other harmful events. The estimated $61.9 
billion bill (relative SE = 18.5%) included $5.4 billion in medical costs, $14.9 
billion in work loss and other resource costs, and $41.6 billion in lost quality 
of life. Quality-of-life costs, which accounted for 67% of total costs, required 
challenging indirect measurement. Alcohol-attributable violence and traffic 
crashes dominated the costs. Leaving aside quality of life, the societal harm of 
$1 per drink consumed by an underage drinker exceeded the average purchase price 
of $0.90 or the associated $0.10 in tax revenues.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent attention has focused on problems resulting from youth use 
of illicit drugs and tobacco. In light of the associated substantial injuries, 
deaths, and high costs to society, youth drinking behaviors merit the same kind 
of serious attention.

With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in mid-1995, the 
prognosis for HIV-infected individuals has brightened dramatically. However, the 
conjunction of potent antiviral therapy and longer life expectancy may engender 
a variety of health risks that, heretofore, HIV specialists have not had to 
confront. The long-term effects of HIV infection itself and exposure to 
antiretroviral agents is unknown. Several aspects of aging, including 
psychiatric disease, neurocognitive impairment, and metabolic and hormonal 
disorders, may be influenced by chronic exposure to HIV and/or HIV therapeutics. 
In this paper, we discuss the health issues confronting HIV-infected older 
adults and areas for future research.

(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-9032, USA scott.roberts@utsouthwestern.edu

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate whether universal influenza 
vaccination of pregnant women was cost-effective in the management of 
influenza-like illness during influenza season.
METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of providing inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine to all 
pregnant women. This scenario was compared with providing supportive care only 
on a case-by-case basis to the unvaccinated pregnant population.
RESULTS: Vaccination of 100% of pregnant women would save approximately 50 
dollars per woman, resulting in a net gain of approximately 45 quality-adjusted 
hours relative to providing supportive care only.
CONCLUSION: Universal vaccination with inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine 
is cost-saving relative to providing supportive care alone in the pregnant 
population.

[Stem cells after myocardial infarction].

Loss of contractile myocardial tissue after myocardial infarction is followed by 
a remodeling of the left ventricle and clinical manifestation of heart failure, 
associated with a reduced life expectancy. One possibility to counteract the 
remodeling process would be to regenerate cardiomyocytes and to improve 
neovascularization in the infarct area. Indeed, experimental studies demonstrate 
that transplantation of adult stem or progenitor cells such as circulating, 
endothelial progenitor cells (CPCs) or progenitor cells derived from the bone 
marrow, is a therapeutic strategy to improve neovascularization and left 
ventricular (LV) function after myocardial infarction. First clinical trials in 
patients after an acute myocardial infarction indicate that intracoronary 
transplantation of adult progenitor cells is feasible and safe. Furthermore, 
patients treated with progenitor cells experienced an unexpectedly large 
improvement of LV function and geometry as well as vascularization, indicating a 
beneficial effect of the progenitor cell treatment on the postinfarction course. 
Randomized trials have obtained mixed results with respect to improvement of LV 
function after intracoronary infusion of progenitor cells, which may be due to 
methodological differences. However, in the largest trial, REPAIR-AMI, LV 
function significantly improved in progenitor cell-treated patients compared to 
a double-blind, randomized placebo-control group. Of note, that trial used a 
previously validated processing of progenitor cells with respect to in vitro and 
in vivo progenitor capacity of the cells. The data available, therefore, 
encourage assessing the efficacy of intracoronary infusion of progenitor 
cells-established to be efficient in previous trials-after acute myocardial 
infarction in larger, randomized controlled trials in order to assess the effect 
on mortality and morbidity.

To address reduced physical education (PE) in elementary schools, a 12-week 
physical activity protocol was tested on 5-12-year-old, primarily African 
American, girls (n = 226) and boys (n = 344) at 14 YMCA after-school care sites. 
The 3 times/week, 45-min session curriculum included cardiovascular, resistance, 
and flexibility training, in which all children could participate 
simultaneously, and a behavioral skills education component. After-school 
counselors, formerly untrained in PE methods, administered the sessions, with 
periodic supervision by YMCA wellness staff members. Analyses of the eight Age x 
Sex subsamples indicated significant improvements on body composition, strength, 
and endurance, both within-groups and when predicted changes due to maturation 
were accounted for. Exercise barriers self-efficacy significantly increased in 
subsamples of 9-10- and 11-12-year-old girls only. The need for replication 
across ethnic groups was suggested. Limitations and the need for extension of 
research on supplementation of elementary school PE were discussed.

Sustainability in the context of China is an immediate and massive concept. A 
society of 1.3 billion has economic growth of 9-10% and a dramatic rise in life 
expectancy. It has rapidly-accumulating material wealth, major lifestyle changes 
and growing inequalities. It is putting great pressure on natural resources such 
as water and air quality. The Chinese Government's new 5-year plan uses the term 
'sustainable development' as an important social goal for the first time. 
Sustainability requires a global effort and Sino-European partnerships are 
important.

BACKGROUND: More than one million individuals in Mexico are infected with 
hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 80% are at risk for developing a chronic infection 
that could lead to hepatic cirrhosis and other complications that impact quality 
of life and institutional costs. The objective of the study was to determine the 
most cost-effective treatment against HCV among the following: peginterferon, 
peginterferon plus ribavirin, peginterferon plus ribavirin plus thymosin, and no
