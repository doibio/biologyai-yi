specific characteristics (age, gender, education, cardiovascular risk factors, 
body mass index, cardiovascular history, depressive symptomatology, impaired 
renal function, and APOEɛ4 genotype) was also investigated. We analyzed the 
Three-City study data, a French population-based cohort of adults aged 65 years 
and above who were followed up for 12 years from 1999-2001. Among 8,328 
participants selected in the analytical sample (median age, 73.3 years; 60.3% 
women), 809 (9.3%) presented with diabetes at baseline. Over a median follow-up 
period of 8.3 years, 836 participants developed incident dementia. Baseline 
diabetes was associated with a higher risk of dementia: hazard ratio, 1.79 [95% 
confidence interval, 1.46-2.19]. No effect modification was shown. Diabetes was 
associated with a higher 12-year absolute risk of dementia and a lower 
dementia-free life expectancy (e.g., 14.5% [11.2-18.1] versus 8.7% [7.6-10.2], 
and 13.4 [12.7-14.1] years versus 16.5 [16.0-17.1] years, respectively, for a 
70-year-old woman with the highest level of education). These findings support 
the potential impact of preventing diabetes on reducing dementia risk in older 
adults, with a 2-3-year higher dementia-free life expectancy for individuals 
without diabetes, and inform the design of future interventional trials.

Weight gain is an adverse effect of antidepressants and antipsychotics. This 
side effect can lead to numerous comorbidities and reduces life expectancy. The 
use of these drugs is increasing worldwide, and the weight gain produced by them 
represents a common clinical challenge. The goal of this systematic review was 
to evaluate the potential association of antidepressant and antipsychotic 
therapy with body weight gain in cohort studies. A search of cohort studies 
investigating the association between weight gain and the use of antidepressants 
and antipsychotics in individuals was conducted through the PubMed database from 
1 January 2008 to 31 January 2019 following the PRISMA statement. We found 27 
independent eligible cohort studies that included children (2-18 years old) and 
adult (18-103 years old) subjects. Most of the included studies showed a 5% 
weight gain in individuals using antidepressant therapy. However, Quetiapine, 
Haloperidol, Trifluoperazine, Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Olanzapine, and 
Clozapine increased body weight ≥7% from baseline, which is considered a 
clinically significant result. Weight loss was found in individuals treated with 
Bupropion. Further cohort studies with higher sample sizes and longer durations 
of treatment are needed to confirm our observations.

Patient Perceptions of Diabetes Guideline Frameworks for Individualizing 
Glycemic Targets.

Medicine, Columbus.

IMPORTANCE: Diabetes guidelines recommend considering specific factors, such as 
diabetes duration and life expectancy, to individualize treatment in older 
adults. These individualized glycemic targets inform decisions on whether to 
intensify or deintensify medication treatment plans. How older adults with 
diabetes perceive these factors used to individualize glycemic targets is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To examine how older adults perceive factors used in diabetes 
guidelines for individualizing glycemic targets.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional national survey was 
conducted from December 13, 2018, to January 3, 2019, of a nationally 
representative, probability-based online survey panel (KnowledgePanel). A total 
of 1364 KnowledgePanel members who were 65 years or older and had type 2 
diabetes were invited to participate in the survey; 836 (61.3%) responded, and 
818 (60.0%) completed the survey.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study randomized participants to 2 vignettes: 
one about adding and the other about removing diabetes medications from 
treatment plans. Participants rated the importance of 7 factors (diabetes 
duration, established diabetes complications, other health conditions, life 
expectancy, risk of adverse effects, cost, and treatment effort) in these 
treatment decisions using binary (yes/no) responses and the best-worst scaling 
method to quantify the factors' relative importance. All participants then 
answered questions on how different levels of each factor were associated with 
aggressiveness of diabetes treatment.
RESULTS: The sample included 818 participants (mean [SD] age, 74.0 [6.8] years; 
469 [53.7%] male; and 668 [67.7%] white). A total of 410 participants answered 
questions about adding medicine, whereas 408 participants answered questions 
about stopping medicine. Of the 7 factors to consider for adding a diabetes 
medication to the treatment plan, the number who deemed each factor important 
ranged from 197 (45.6%) to 263 (62.8%). In contrast, these same factors were 
considered important by only 29 (8.4%) to 146 (37.7%) of participants when 
deciding to stop use of a diabetes medication. In both decisions, participants 
perceived the risk of adverse effects as the most important factor (relative 
importance was 22.8 for adding a medicine and 25.0 for stopping a medicine on a 
ratio scale in which, for each decision, the relative importance of the 7 
factors adds up to 100, with 0 indicating complete indifference and 100 complete 
priority). In contrast to current guideline recommendations, most participants 
believed that patients with longer disease duration (498 [60.1%]), more 
established complications (632 [75.6%]), and greater number of other health 
conditions (545 [67.5%]) should receive more aggressive diabetes treatment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many older adults do not place high importance on 
factors recommended by guidelines to individualize diabetes treatment, 
especially when deciding to stop use of diabetes medications. Moreover, when 
considering treatment aggressiveness, many older adults weighted several factors 
in the opposite direction than suggested by the guidelines. Individualizing 
diabetes care in older adults will require effective communication regarding the 
benefits and consequences of making changes to treatment plans.

The type IV pilus protein PilU functions as a PilT-dependent retraction ATPase.

Type IV pili are dynamic cell surface appendages found throughout the bacteria. 
The ability of these structures to undergo repetitive cycles of extension and 
retraction underpins their crucial roles in adhesion, motility and natural 
competence for transformation. In the best-studied systems a dedicated 
retraction ATPase PilT powers pilus retraction. Curiously, a second presumed 
retraction ATPase PilU is often encoded immediately downstream of pilT. However, 
despite the presence of two potential retraction ATPases, pilT deletions lead to 
a total loss of pilus function, raising the question of why PilU fails to take 
over. Here, using the DNA-uptake pilus and mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin 
(MSHA) pilus of Vibrio cholerae as model systems, we show that inactivated PilT 
variants, defective for either ATP-binding or hydrolysis, have unexpected 
intermediate phenotypes that are PilU-dependent. In addition to demonstrating 
that PilU can function as a bona fide retraction ATPase, we go on to make the 
surprising discovery that PilU functions exclusively in a PilT-dependent manner 
and identify a naturally occurring pandemic V. cholerae PilT variant that 
renders PilU essential for pilus function. Finally, we show that Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa PilU also functions as a PilT-dependent retraction ATPase, providing 
evidence that the functional coupling between PilT and PilU could be a 
widespread mechanism for optimal pilus retraction.

Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) combine agronomic or plant growth models with 
gridded spatial input data to estimate spatially explicit crop yields and 
agricultural externalities at the global scale. Differences in GGCM outputs 
arise from the use of different biophysical models, setups, and input data. GGCM 
ensembles are frequently employed to bracket uncertainties in impact studies 
without investigating the causes of divergence in outputs. This study explores 
differences in maize yield estimates from five GGCMs based on the public domain 
field-scale model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) that 
participate in the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison initiative. 
Albeit using the same crop model, the GGCMs differ in model version, input data, 
management assumptions, parameterization, and selection of subroutines affecting 
crop yield estimates via cultivar distributions, soil attributes, and hydrology 
among others. The analyses reveal inter-annual yield variability and absolute 
yield levels in the EPIC-based GGCMs to be highly sensitive to soil 
parameterization and crop management. All GGCMs show an intermediate performance 
in reproducing reported yields with a higher skill if a static soil profile is 
assumed or sufficient plant nutrients are supplied. An in-depth comparison of 
setup domains for two EPIC-based GGCMs shows that GGCM performance and plant 
stress responses depend substantially on soil parameters and soil process 
parameterization, i.e. hydrology and nutrient turnover, indicating that these 
often neglected domains deserve more scrutiny. For agricultural impact 
assessments, employing a GGCM ensemble with its widely varying assumptions in 
setups appears the best solution for coping with uncertainties from lack of 
comprehensive global data on crop management, cultivar distributions and 
coefficients for agro-environmental processes. However, the underlying 
assumptions require systematic specifications to cover representative 
agricultural systems and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the interlinkage 
of parameter sensitivity from various domains such as soil parameters, nutrient 
turnover coefficients, and cultivar specifications highlights that global 
sensitivity analyses and calibration need to be performed in an integrated 
manner to avoid bias resulting from disregarded core model domains. Finally, 
relating evaluations of the EPIC-based GGCMs to a wider ensemble based on 
individual core models shows that structural differences outweigh in general 
differences in configurations of GGCMs based on the same model, and that the 
ensemble mean gains higher skill from the inclusion of structurally different 
GGCMs. Although the members of the wider ensemble herein do not consider 
crop-soil-management interactions, their sensitivity to nutrient supply 
indicates that findings for the EPIC-based sub-ensemble will likely become 
relevant for other GGCMs with the progressing inclusion of such processes.

We present the case of a male diagnosed with a giant hepatic artery aneurysm, 
which first presented with pain and hemorrhage due to a partial rupture of the 
aneurysm. After discarding treatment with a stent or surgery due to the wide 
extension, we chose to embolize the hepatic artery with coils. However, the 
progress was unfavorable after the procedure, with the appearance of liver 
failure that was resolved by an urgent liver transplantation. Giant hepatic 
artery pseudoaneurysms are an infrequent entity and their management is a great 
challenge. The diagnosis is usually delayed due to non-specific clinical signs 
and the life of the patient may be threatened in the case of rupture. Thus, 
endovascular or surgical treatment is recommended. Aneurysm embolization or 
ligation has been described in the literature as a valid treatment option in 
cases where revascularization by stent or bypass is not possible, as it 
preserves the viability of the liver due to the portal flow and collateral 
arteries. However, in the case of the failure of these treatments, liver 
transplantation is a rescue option.

People are living and driving longer than ever before, with little preparation 
for transitioning to being non-drivers. We investigated driving expectations 
among drivers age 65 and older, including sociodemographic and driving context 
predictors. Cross-sectional data from 349 older drivers were explored to 
determine variation in how many years they expected to continue driving. General 
linear models examined predictors of both expectations. In this predominantly 
Black/African American sample, 76% of older drivers (mean age = 73 ± 5.7 years) 
expected a non-driving future, forecasting living an average of 
5.75 ± 7.29 years after driving cessation. Regression models on years left of 
driving life and years left to live post-driving cessation predicted nearly half 
of the variance in older drivers' expectations with five significant predictors: 
income, current age, age expected to live to, self-limiting driving to nearby 
places and difficulty, visualizing being a non-driver. Many older drivers expect 
to stop driving before end of life.

Aims: The costs associated with insulin therapy and diabetes-related 
complications represent a significant and growing economic burden for healthcare 
systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
switching to insulin degludec (degludec) vs continuing previous basal insulin, 
in Italian patients with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 (T2D) diabetes, using a 
long-term economic model.Materials and methods: Data were retrieved from a 
real-world population of patients from clinical practice in Italy. Clinical 
parameters included in the base-case model were change from baseline in HbA1c, 
rates of hypoglycemia, and basal and bolus insulin dose, at 6 months following 
switch to degludec. Costs of treatments were taken from official Italian 
pharmaceutical list prices and costs of hypoglycemia were based on the 
literature. The data were used to populate a long-term (lifetime) IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The robustness of these results was 
tested with extensive sensitivity analyses by varying the time horizons and 
abolishing each of the treatment differences and previous basal 
insulins.Results: The total incremental cost for degludec vs previous basal 
insulin was €-6,310 and €-2,682 for patients with T1D and T2D, respectively; the 
switch to degludec resulted in a QALY gain of 0.781 and 0.628. The long-term 
ICER for degludec vs continuing the previous basal insulin regimen showed that 
degludec was dominant for both T1D and T2D, meaning that patient health was 
improved in terms of QALYs with lower healthcare costs. Sensitivity analyses 
showed that degludec remained dominant in most scenarios including after 
elimination of any benefit in non-severe hypoglycemia and insulin dose, in both 
T1D and T2D.Conclusions: Under routine care, switching to degludec is dominant, 
compared with continuing previous basal insulin, in Italian patients with T1D or 
T2D.

AIM: Compared with the general population, individuals with schizophrenia have a 
higher risk of periodontal disease, which can potentially reduce their life 
expectancy. However, evidence for the early development of periodontal disease 
in schizophrenia is scant. The current study investigated risk factors for 
periodontal disease in patients newly diagnosed with schizophrenia.
METHODS: We identified a population-based cohort of patients in Taiwan with 
newly diagnosed schizophrenia who developed periodontal disease within 1 year of 
their schizophrenia diagnosis. Treatment with antipsychotics and other 
medications was categorised according to medication type and duration, and the 
association between medication use and the treated periodontal disease was 
assessed through logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 3610 patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia, 2373 (65.7%) 
had an incidence of treated periodontal disease during the 1-year follow-up. 
Female sex (adjusted odds ratios [OR] 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.20-1.63); young age (adjusted OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99); a 2-year history of 
periodontal disease (adjusted OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.84-3.26); high income level 
(adjusted OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.64-3.06) and exposure to first-generation (adjusted 
OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.54-2.32) and secondary-generation (adjusted OR 1.33; 95% CI 
1.11-1.58) antipsychotics, anticholinergics (adjusted OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.03-1.50) 
and antihypertensives (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.64-2.23) were independent risk 
factors for periodontal disease. Hyposalivation - an adverse effect of 
first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) (adjusted OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.63-2.45), 
anticholinergics (adjusted OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.05-1.53) and antihypertensives 
(adjusted OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.63-2.22) - was associated with increased risk of 
periodontal disease. Therefore, hypersalivation due to FGA use (adjusted OR 
0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.88) was considered a protective factor.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights that early prevention of periodontal 
disease in individuals with schizophrenia is crucial. Along with paying more 
attention to the development of periodontal disease, assessing oral health 
regularly, helping with oral hygiene, and lowering consumption of sugary drinks 
and tobacco, emphasis should also be given by physicians to reduce the 
prescription of antipsychotics to the extent possible under efficacious 
pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia.

In an ever-changing and often ambiguous environment, organisms must use 
previously learned associations between antecedents and outcomes to predict 
future associations and make optimal choices. Chronic stress can impair one's 
ability to flexibly adjust behaviors when environmental contingencies change, 
particularly in cases of early-life stress. In mice, exposure to elevated levels 
of the primary stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT), during early adolescence 
is sufficient to impair response-outcome decision making later in life, biasing 
response strategies towards inflexible habits. Nevertheless, neurobiological 
mechanisms are still being defined. Here, we report that exposure to excess CORT 
in adolescence causes a loss of dendritic spines on excitatory pyramidal neurons 
in the lateral, but not medial, orbital prefrontal cortex (loPFC) of mice, and 
spine loss correlates with the severity of habit biases in adulthood. Excess 
CORT also reduces the presence of ventral hippocampal (vHC) axon terminals in 
the loPFC. To identify functional consequences, we inactivated vHC→loPFC 
projections in typical healthy mice during a period when mice must update 
response-outcome expectations to optimally acquire food reinforcers. 
Inactivation impaired the animals' subsequent ability to sustainably choose 
actions based on likely outcomes, causing them to defer to habit-based response 
strategies. Thus, vHC→loPFC projections are necessary for response-outcome 
expectancy updating and a target of excess glucocorticoids during early-life 
development. Their degradation is likely involved in long-term biases towards 
habit-based behaviors following glucocorticoid excess in adolescence.

[Purpose] In patients with critical limb ischemia, the ambulatory state often 
has a lasting impact on recovery and wound healing. The aim of this study was to 
examine the predictive factors connected with the ambulatory state in wounds 
with critical limb ischemia. [Participants and Methods] This study included 125 
inpatients with critical limb ischemia, who underwent physical therapy between 
January 2015 and December 2018. We retrospectively studied factors from the 
participant's medical records and comparisons were made between the ambulatory 
and non-ambulatory groups. Next, we analyzed the differences between factors 
using multiple logistic regression analysis. [Results] The factors associated 
with the ambulatory state in patients with critical limb ischemia, as determined 
by multiple logistic regression analysis, were knee extension muscle strength, 
off-loading the foot duration, and the presence or absence of heart disease. 
[Conclusion] Shortening off-loading the foot period and intensive rehabilitation 
at an early stage after amputation need to be prioritized to maintain the 
quality of life and ambulatory status of patients with wounds in critical limb 
ischemia.

Extensive evidence indicates the causal association of school outcomes and 
long-term health. We combined the findings of two studies by Chetty and 
colleagues to estimate the life expectancy associated with achievement scores in 
the eighth grade. We linked the dependent variable of the first study and the 
independent variable of the second study. The first study (of students in 
Tennessee) found a positive correlation between school achievement scores in 
eighth grade and income at age 25-27. Controlling for family background, a one 
percentile increase in eighth grade test score was associated with an increase 
of $148 (95% CI: $125, $172) in 2009 $U.S. in mean yearly wages at ages 
25-27 years. Based on estimated mean annual income growth of 3.35%, $148 would 
increase 1.59 fold to $235 (CI: $199, $273) in 14 years, at age 40-$251 (CI: 
$213, $292) in 2012 $U.S. adjusted for inflation. The second study (of the U.S. 
population) found that a one percentile household income ($1500 in 2012 $U.S.) 
was associated with one month life expectancy at age 40. We calculate that an 
increase in income at age 40 attributable to one percentile increase in eighth 
grade test scores, i.e., $251, would increase life expectancy by 17% (i.e., 
$251/$1500) (CI: 14%, 19%) of one month per percentile eighth grade test score. 
Estimates of long-term health outcomes associated with educational outcomes can 
be made with caution. Applicability of findings from the Tennessee to the U.S. 
population is discussed.

Paulo, Brazil.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is considered one of the major conditions 
faced by aging societies. Little has been reported about the effect of becoming 
frail on life expectancy among older adults in developing countries. The aim was 
to estimate total life expectancy and life expectancy with or without frailty by 
age, sex, and education among older adults in Brazil.Data and Methods:  The 
study was developed based on information provided by the Health, Well-being, and 
Aging (SABE) Study. The sample included 1,399 older adults (≥60 years old) 
followed up from 2006 to 2010. Frailty status was classified according to the 
Fried criteria. Additional variables include age (in years), gender, and years 
of education. Estimates of total life expectancy, frailty-free life expectancy, 
and frailty life expectancy were obtained using the multistate life table 
method.
RESULTS: At the baseline, the proportion of individuals with frailty was 13.7% 
and participants had, on average, 4.0 years of education. Men had more years of 
education than women (4.6 vs. 3.7, p < .001). Older adults with higher education 
live fewer years with frailty. Compared with older adults with no education, 
those with 6 years of education have higher frailty-free life expectancy. At age 
70, men with no education expect to live 9.1 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 7.8, 10.4) without frailty compared with 10.6 years (95% CI = 9.4, 11.8) among 
those with 6 years of education. Among women age 70, frailty-free life 
expectancy reaches 11.7 years (95% CI = 10.6, 12.8) among those with no 
education, but 13.9 years (95% CI = 12.5, 15.3) among those with 6 years.
IMPLICATIONS: Given the recent changes in educational achievement in Brazil, we 
believe that educational policies are powerful ways in addressing inequalities 
in healthy life expectancy. Public health policies aimed at avoiding the 
development of frailty among elderly at risk should be encouraged.

Currently, antibodies are widely used not only in research but also in therapy. 
Hence, peptides that selectively bind to the fragment crystallizable site of an 
antibody have been extensively utilized in various research efforts such as the 
preparation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Consequently, appropriate 
peptides that bind to immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a specific K d value and also 
k on and k off values will be useful in different applications, and these 
kinetic parameters have been perhaps overlooked but are key to development of 
peptide ligands with advantageous binding properties. We prepared structural 
derivatives of IgG-binding peptide 1 and evaluated the binding affinity and 
kinetic rates of the products by surface plasmon resonance assay and isothermal 
titration calorimetry to obtain novel peptides with beneficial antibody binding 
properties. In this way, 15-Lys8Leu with fast-binding and slow-release features 
was obtained through a shortened peptide 15-IgBP. On the other hand, we 
successfully obtained distinctive peptide, 15-Lys8Tle, with a similar K d value 
but with k on and k off values that were as much as six-fold different from 
those of 15-IgBP. These new peptides are useful for the elucidation of kinetic 
effects on the function of IgG-binding peptides and various applications of 
antibody or antibody-drug interactions, such as immunoliposome, ADC, or 
half-life extension strategy, by using a peptide with the appropriate kinetic 
features.

Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondrial Cross-Talk in Neurodegenerative and Eye 
Diseases.

Boston, MA, USA.

Neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate the progressive decline of brain 
functions resulting in a significant deterioration in the quality of patient's 
life. With increasing life expectancy, there has been a significant increase in 
the incidence of these diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are devastating and afflicts a 
large world population. Eye, given the similar neural and vascular similarity to 
the brain, demonstrates many pathological hallmarks of some of these 
neurological diseases. Moreover, these diseases create an economic and social 
burden to society. Despite tremendous efforts made in the drug discovery, there 
is no cure for these fatal diseases. Thus, there is an unmet need to understand 
cellular and molecular pathophysiology of these diseases. All these diseases 
demonstrate damage to a large number of seemingly disparate cellular processes 
and functions such as Ca+2 homeostasis, lipid metabolism, axonal transport, 
unfolded protein response, autophagy and inflammatory responses. Mitochondria 
are closely associated with Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-mitochondrial 
cross-talk regulates many of these cellular processes and functions damaged in 
neurodegenerative and eye diseases. Several studies have implicated the 
disruption of ER-mitochondria contacts in these diseases. This review is aimed 
at understanding and summarizing the role of ER-mitochondria interacting 
proteins in major neurodegenerative and eye diseases studied so far.

OBJECTIVE: HIV+ patients have increased their life expectancy with a parallel 
increase in age-associated co-morbidities and pharmacotherapeutic complexity. 
The aim of this study was to determine an optimal cutoff value for Medication 
regimen complexity index (MRCI) to predict polypharmacy in HIV+ older patients.
METHODS: A transversal observational single cohort study was conducted at a 
tertiary Hospital in Spain, between January 1st up to December 31st, 2014. 
Patients included were HIV patients over 50 years of age on active 
antiretroviral treatment. Prevalence of polypharmacy and it pattern were 
analyzed. The pharmacotherapy complexity value was calculated through the MRCI. 
Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to calculate the area 
under the curve (AUC) for the MRCI value medications to determine the best 
cutoff value for identifying outcomes including polypharmacy. Sensitivity and 
specificity were also calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were included. A 56.1% of patients had 
polypharmacy, being extreme polypharmacy in 9.4% of cases. Regarding the pattern 
of polypharmacy, 78.0% had a cardio-metabolic pattern, 12.0% 
depressive-psychogeriatric, 8.0% mixed and 2.0% mechanical-thyroidal. The ROC 
curve demonstrated that a value of medication complexity index of 11.25 point 
was the best cutoff for predict polypharmacy (AUC=0.931; sensitivity= 77.6%; 
specificity=91.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: A cut-off value of 11.25 for MRCI is proposed to determine if a 
patient reaches the criterion of polypharmacy. In conclusion, the concept of 
polypharmacy should include not only the number of prescribed drugs but also the 
complexity of them.

INTRODUCCIÓN: La esperanza de vida de los pacientes VIH+ se ha incrementado. De 
forma paralela han aumentado las comorbilidades asociadas a la edad y la 
complejidad farmacoterapéutica. El objetivo del estudio es estimar el valor 
umbral del índice de complejidad de la farmacoterapia (MRCI) para la 
determinación del criterio de polifarmacia en pacientes VIH+ mayores de 50 años.
MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional, trasversal, unicéntrico. Se incluyeron todos los 
pacientes VIH+ mayores de 50 años, en tratamiento antirretroviral activo entre 
el 1 enero y 31 diciembre-2015. Se determinó la presencia de polifarmacia y los 
patrones asociados. La complejidad del tratamiento se calculó con la herramienta 
MRCI (Universidad de Colorado). Se analizó el índice de complejidad total como 
marcador cuantitativo de polifarmacia mediante la realización de una curva ROC y 
el cálculo de su área bajo la curva. Se calculó la sensibilidad y la 
especificidad de la misma.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 223 pacientes. El 56,1% presentó polifarmacia, siendo 
extrema en el 9,4% de los casos. En relación con el patrón de polifarmacia, el 
78,0% presentaron un patrón cardio-metabólico, el 12,0% psico 
geriátrico-depresivo, el 8,0% mixto y el 2,0% mecánico tiroideo .Se determinó un 
valor de área bajo la curva ROC de 0,931 con límites entre (0,901-0,962) y p< 
0,001. El valor 11,25 de índice de complejidad total de la farmacoterapia 
proporcionó un valor de especificidad del 92% y una sensibilidad del 78%.
CONCLUSIÓN: El valor de 11,25 de índice de complejidad es un buen indicador para 
conocer los pacientes con polifarmacia. El concepto de polifarmacia no solo debe 
incluir el número de fármacos que toma el paciente sino incluir también la 
complejidad del tratamiento.

BACKGROUND: The 122 years and 164 days age claim of Jeanne Calment, the world 
oldest person who died in 1997, is the most thoroughly validated age claim. 
Recently the claim that families Calment and Billot organized a conspiracy 
concerning tax fraud based on identity fraud between mother and daughter gained 
international media attention.
METHODS: Here, we reference the original components of the validation as well as 
additional documentation to address various claims of the conspiracy theory and 
provide evidence for why these claims are based on inaccurate facts or unrelated 
to the death of Yvonne Billot-Calment, the daughter of Jeanne Calment, in 1934.
RESULTS: Also, countering the contention that the occurrence of a 122 year old 
person is statistically impossible, mathematical models are presented which also 
supports the hypothesis that though extremely rare, as would be expected for the 
oldest person ever, Jeanne Calment's age claim is plausible.
CONCLUSIONS: In total, the quality of the investigation supporting the claim of 
conspiracy as well as the mathematical analysis aiming to back it do not reach 
the level expected for a scientific publication.

Neuromyelitis optica is an immune-mediated disease characterized by a relapsing 
course, resulting in progressive disability. In children, given the long life 
expectancy, a disease-modifying treatment could be particularly desirable. 
Unfortunately, the currently available treatment strategies with this potential 
are scarce. Very limited data are available about the use of allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for autoimmune neurological 
diseases. In this report, we present a pediatric case successfully treated with 
allogeneic HSCT from an HLA-haploidentical donor, after ex vivo 
TCR/CD19-depletion of the graft. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
case of a pediatric patient to benefit from such a treatment.

KEY POINTS: Females demonstrate greater fatigue resistance than males during 
contractions at intensities relative to maximum force. However, previous studies 
have not accounted for the influence of metabolic thresholds on fatigability. 
This study is the first to test whether sex differences in fatigability exist 
when exercise intensity is normalised relative to a metabolic threshold: the 
critical intensity derived from assessment of the intensity-duration 
relationship during intermittent, isometric knee extensor contractions. We show 
that critical intensity in females occurred at a higher percentage of maximum 
force compared to males. Furthermore, females demonstrated greater fatigue 
resistance at exercise intensities above and below this metabolic threshold. Our 
data suggest that the sex difference was mediated by lesser deoxygenation of the 
knee extensors during exercise. These data highlight the importance of 
accounting for metabolic thresholds when comparing fatigability between sexes, 
whilst emphasising the notion that male data are not generalisable to female 
populations.
ABSTRACT: Females are less fatigable than males during isometric exercise at 
intensities relative to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC); however, whether a 
sex difference in fatigability exists when exercise is prescribed relative to a 
critical intensity is unknown. This study established the intensity-duration 
relationship, and compared fatigability and recovery between sexes following 
intermittent isometric contractions normalised to critical intensity. Twenty 
participants (10 females) completed four intermittent isometric knee extension 
trials to task failure to determine critical intensity and the curvature 
constant (W'), followed by fatiguing tasks at +10% and -10% relative to critical 
intensity. Neuromuscular assessments were completed at baseline and for 45 min 
post-exercise. Non-invasive neurostimulation, near-infrared spectroscopy, and 
non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring were used to elucidate the physiological 
mechanisms responsible for sex differences. Females demonstrated a greater 
critical intensity relative to MVC than males (25 ± 3 vs. 21 ± 2% MVC, 
P = 0.003), with no sex difference for W' (18,206 ± 6331 vs. 18,756 ± 5762 N s, 
P = 0.850). Time to task failure was greater for females (62.37 ± 17.25 vs. 
30.43 ± 12.75 min, P < 0.001) during the +10% trial, and contractile function 
recovered faster post-exercise (P = 0.034). During the -10% trial females 
experienced less contractile dysfunction (P = 0.011). Throughout the +10% trial, 
females demonstrated lesser decreases in deoxyhaemoglobin (P = 0.007) and an 
attenuated exercise pressor reflex. These data show that a sex difference in 
fatigability exists even when exercise is matched for critical intensity. We 
propose that greater oxygen availability during exercise permits females to 
sustain a higher relative intensity than males, and is an explanatory factor for 
the sex difference in fatigability during intermittent, isometric contractions.

often challenging. Telerehabilitation helps negate access issues and is 
efficacious in total knee and hip replacement patients. This study aims to
