RESULTS: Using the Markov Model with an annual case volume of 500 patients and a 
mean age of 65 years, the overall health gain per patient was 13.34 QALYs after 
rTKA and 13.31 QALYs after manual TKA. This resulted in an overall gain in QALYs 
of 0.03 for each patient undergoing an rTKA compared with manual TKA and an 
incremental cost of $128,526 Singapore Dollars per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Robotic TKA is not a cost-effective alternative to conventional TKA 
using a pay-per-use contract robot.

Despite the use of high-resolution molecular techniques for tissue typing, 
chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) remains a major complication following 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. cGVHD adversely affects the 
life-expectancy and quality of life. The latter is particularly important and 
functionally relevant in pediatric patients who have a longer life-expectancy 
than adults. Current laboratory evidence suggests that there is not any 
difference in the pathophysiology of cGVHD between adults and pediatric 
patients. However, there are some clinical features and complications of the 
disease that are different in pediatric patients. There are also challenges in 
the development of new therapeutics for this group of patients. In this review, 
we will discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features and 
consequences of the disease, and highlight the differences between pediatric and 
adult patients. We will examine the current treatment options for pediatric 
patients with moderate to severe cGVHD and discuss the challenges facing 
therapeutic development for cGVHD in the pediatric population.

This study aimed to determine the common latent patterns of geographical 
distribution of health-related minerals across the USA and to evaluate the 
real-world cumulative effects of these patterns on overall population health. It 
was an ecological study using county-level data (3080 contiguous counties) on 
the concentrations of 14 minerals (i.e., aluminum, arsenic, calcium, copper, 
iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury, phosphorus, selenium, sodium, 
titanium, zinc) in stream sediments (or surface soils), and the measurements of 
overall health including life expectancy at birth, age-specific mortality risks 
and cause-specific (summarized by 21 mutually exclusive groups) mortality rates. 
Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to identify the common clusters of life 
expectancy-related minerals based on their concentration characteristics. 
Multivariate linear regression analyses were then conducted to examine the 
relationship between the LCA-derived clusters and the health measurements, with 
adjustment for potential confounding factors. Five minerals (i.e., arsenic, 
calcium, selenium, sodium and zinc) were associated with life expectancy and 
were analyzed in LCA. Three clusters were determined across the USA, the 
'common' (n = 2056, 66.8%), 'infertile' (n = 739, 24.0%) and 'plentiful' 
(n = 285, 9.3%) clusters. Residents in counties with the 'infertile' profile 
were associated with the shortest life expectancy, highest mortality risks at 
all ages, and highest mortality rates for many reasons including the top five 
leading causes of death: cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, neurological 
disorders, chronic respiratory conditions, and diabetes, urogenital, blood and 
endocrine diseases. Results remained statistically significant after confounding 
adjustment. Our study brings novel perspectives regarding environmental 
geochemistry to explain health disparities in the USA.

Globally, it is evident that glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive 
malignant cancer with a high mortality rate and no effective treatment options. 
Glioblastoma is classified as the stage-four progression of a glioma tumor, and 
its diagnosis results in a shortened life expectancy. Treatment options for GBM 
include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgical intervention, and conventional 
pharmacotherapy; however, at best, they extend the patient's life by a maximum 
of 5 years. GBMs are considered incurable due to their high recurrence rate, 
despite various aggressive therapeutic approaches which can have many serious 
adverse effects. Ceramides, classified as endocannabinoids, offer a promising 
novel therapeutic approach for GBM. Endocannabinoids may enhance the apoptosis 
of GBM cells but have no effect on normal healthy neural cells. Cannabinoids 
promote atypical protein kinase C, deactivate fatty acid amide hydrolase 
enzymes, and activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and TRPV2 
to induce pro-apoptotic signaling pathways without increasing endogenous 
cannabinoids. In previous in vivo studies, endocannabinoids, chemically 
classified as amide formations of oleic and palmitic acids, have been shown to 
increase the pro-apoptotic activity of human cancer cells and inhibit cell 
migration and angiogenesis. This review focuses on the biological synthesis and 
pharmacology of endogenous cannabinoids for the enhancement of cancer cell 
apoptosis, which have potential as a novel therapy for GBM. Please cite this

In nature, cold stress is a core threat to aquatic organisms. But the 
neurodevelopmental effects of cold stress during the perinatal period on the 
offspring development were unknown. In the present study, adult zebrafish were 
cold-stressed at 18 °C for five days before spawning, and then the fertilized 
eggs were raised at 18, 24, or 28 °C from 0 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf). 
The resulting embryos and larvae were assessed for developmental and 
neurobehavioral responses. Our findings showed that embryos raised at 18 °C 
(Cold+++) suffered hatching failure and death, at 24 °C (Cold++) had decreased 
hatching, while those raised at 28 °C (Cold+) exhibited no developmental 
adversity. The neurobehavioral assessment showed that embryos from Cold+ and 
Cold++ groups displayed decreased motor behaviors, including spontaneous 
movement at 20-24 hpf, touch response at 48 hpf, and swimming speed at 120 hpf. 
In addition, cold stress during perinatal stage irreversibly affected larval 
social behaviors examined during 10-13 days post fertilization (dpf), such as 
unconsolidated shoaling, increased mirror attacks, and decreased social 
contacts. Notably, behavioral adversity was more pronounced in larvae from the 
Cold ++ group than those from the Cold+ group. Mechanistically, cold stress 
increased cell apoptosis, evidenced by increased acridine orange positive cells 
at 24 hpf and upregulation of casp8 at 120 hpf, increased oxidative stress 
(upregulation of cat and nos1) at 120 hpf, delayed motor neuron extension at 72 
hpf, and upregulated nrxn2 and rab33a at 120 hpf. Our data indicate that cold 
stress during the perinatal period impaired neural development in zebrafish 
larvae, showing high mental health risk. These findings highlight cold stress 
should be avoided during the perinatal period for both aquatic fish or even 
humans.

The neuronal nucleus: a new battlefield in fight against neurodegeneration.

Aging is an inevitable fact of life which brings along a series of 
age-associated diseases. Although medical innovations and patient care 
improvement have increased our life expectancy, the rate of age-associated 
diseases have also increased. Nervous system is specifically prone to these 
diseases that cause neuronal loss in different anatomical regions. Alzheimer's 
disease is the best-known example of age-associated illnesses and is diagnosed 
by accumulation of intracellular Neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular 
Amyloid Plaques resulting in dementia. However, therapeutic attempts aiming at 
the removal of these plaques and tangles to reverse the cognitive decline have 
generally failed in human patients and may compromise the patient's health. We 
have learnt that interruption of neuronal housekeeping systems such as autophagy 
contributes to formation of these aggregates, and therefore understanding the 
underlying mechanisms that lead to failure of these endogenous protective 
systems may provide valuable information and novel therapies. The house keeping 
systems are delicately regulated through gene expression and chromatin 
modifications in the nucleus, however, the contribution of this largest cellular 
organelle in pathophysiology of the disease has been overlooked. During the last 
few years, a wealth of information on neuronal nucleus has emerged that provides 
a strong rationale for examining its contribution to the pathophysiology of the 
disease. In this research perspective, I have attempted to summarize the latest 
research on neuronal nucleus, with a special focus on nuclear lamina damage and 
its downstream events to rationalize the need for focusing on the neuronal 
nucleus as a therapeutic target.

Geroscience puts mechanisms of aging as a driver of the most common age-related 
diseases and dysfunctions. Under this perspective, addressing the basic 
mechanisms of aging will produce a better understanding than addressing each 
disease pathophysiology individually. Worldwide, despite greater functional 
impairment, life expectancy is higher in women than in men. Gender differences 
in the prevalence of multimorbidity lead mandatory to the understanding of the 
mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in multimorbidity patterns and 
disability-free life expectancy. Extensive literature suggested that 
inflammaging is at the crossroad of aging and age-related diseases. In this 
review, we highlight the main evidence on sex/gender differences in the 
mechanisms that foster inflammaging, i.e. the age-dependent triggering of innate 
immunity, modifications of adaptive immunity, and accrual of senescent cells, 
underpinning some biomarkers of inflammaging that show sex-related differences. 
In the framework of the "gender medicine perspective", we will also discuss how 
sex/gender differences in inflammaging can affect sex differences in COVID-19 
severe outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Comprehensive evaluation of the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
lost attributable to chlamydia, gonorrhea, andtrichomoniasis in the United 
States is lacking.
METHODS: We adapted a previous probability-tree model to estimate the average 
number of lifetime QALYs lost due to genital chlamydia, gonorrhea, and 
trichomoniasis, per incident infection and at the population level, by sex and 
age group. We conducted multivariate sensitivity analyses to address uncertainty 
around key parameter values.
RESULTS: The estimated total discounted lifetime QALYs lost for men and women, 
respectively, due to infections acquired in 2018, were 1541 (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI], 186-6358) and 111 872 (95% UI, 29 777-267 404) for chlamydia, 989 
(95% UI, 127-3720) and 12 112 (95% UI, 2 410-33 895) for gonorrhea, and 386 (95% 
UI, 30-1851) and 4576 (95% UI, 13-30 355) for trichomoniasis. Total QALYs lost 
were highest among women aged 15-24 years with chlamydia. QALYs lost estimates 
were highly sensitive to disutilities (health losses) of infections and 
sequelae, and to duration of infections and chronic sequelae for chlamydia and 
gonorrhea in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3 sexually transmitted infections cause substantial health 
losses in the United States, particularly gonorrhea and chlamydia among women. 
The estimates of lifetime QALYs lost per infection help to prioritize prevention 
policies and inform cost-effectiveness analyses of sexually transmitted 
infection interventions.

Two phases for centripetal migration of Drosophila melanogaster follicle cells: 
initial ingression followed by epithelial migration.

Vegas, NV 89154-4004, USA.

During Drosophila oogenesis, somatic follicle cells (FCs) differentiate to 
secrete components of the eggshell. Before secretion, the epithelium reorganizes 
to shape eggshell specializations, including border FC collective cell migration 
and later dorsal formation. These FC movements provide valuable insights into 
collective cell migration. However, little is known about centripetal migration, 
which encloses the oocyte after secretion has begun. Centripetal migration 
begins with apical extension of a few FCs that move away from the basement 
membrane to invade between germ cells. We define a timeline of reproducible 
milestones, using time-lapse imaging of egg chamber explants. Inward migration 
occurs in two phases. First, leading centripetal FCs ingress, extending apically 
over the anterior oocyte, and constricting basally. Second, following FCs move 
collectively toward the anterior, then around the corner to move inward with 
minimal change in aspect ratio. E-cadherin was required in leading centripetal 
FCs for their normal ingression, assessed with homozygous shotgun mutant or RNAi 
knockdown clones; ingression was influenced non-autonomously by mutant following 
FCs. This work establishes centripetal migration as an accessible model for 
biphasic E-cadherin-adhesion-mediated collective migration.

OBJECTIVE: To revisit the current age criterion (50 years) for surgical 
candidacy in patients diagnosed with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism 
(PHPT).
STUDY DESIGN: A predictive model relying on past publications using the 
electronic databases "PubMed," "Embase," "Medline," and "Google Scholar."
SETTING: Hypothetical large cohort.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed, based on relevant literature, to 
compare 2 potential treatment algorithms for asymptomatic PHPT patients, 
parathyroidectomy (PTX), and observation. The various potential health states 
were characterized for the 2 treatment options and included potential surgical 
complications, end-organ deterioration, and death. A 1-way sensitivity analysis 
was performed to calculate the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains of both 
strategies. A Monte-Carlo simulation for 30,000 subjects was performed and 
cycled per annum.
RESULTS: On the basis of the model's assumptions, the QALY value for the PTX 
strategy was 19.17 versus 17.82 for the observation strategy. The incremental 
QALY gains for various ages according to the sensitivity analyses for PTX in 
comparison to observation were: 2.84 QALY for 40-year-old patients, 2.2 QALY for 
50-year-old patients, 1.81 QALY for 55-year-old patients, 1.35 QALY for 
60-year-old patients, and 0.86 QALY for 65-year-old patients. The incremental 
QALY is below 0.5 after the age of 75 years.
CONCLUSION: This study found PTX to be advantageous for asymptomatic PHPT 
patients older than the current age criterion of 50 years. The calculated QALY 
gains support a surgical approach for medically fit patients in their 50s. The 
current guidelines for the surgical treatment of young asymptomatic PHPT 
patients should be revisited by the next steering committee.

INTRODUCTION: Early health-technology assessment can support discussing scarce 
resource allocation among stakeholders. We explored the value of maintaining 
cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by estimating: (1) 
the innovation headroom and (2) the potential cost effectiveness of roflumilast 
treatment in this population.
METHODS: The innovation headroom was operationalized by a fictive 100% 
efficacious treatment effect, and the roflumilast effect on memory word learning 
test was assumed to be associated with 7% relative risk reduction of dementia 
onset. Both were compared to Dutch setting usual care using the adapted 
International Pharmaco-Economic Collaboration on Alzheimer's Disease 
(IPECAD) open-source model.
RESULTS: The total innovation headroom expressed as net health benefit was 4.2 
(95% bootstrap interval: 2.9-5.7) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The 
potential cost effectiveness of roflumilast was k€34 per QALY.
DISCUSSION: The innovation headroom in MCI is substantial. Although the 
potential cost effectiveness of roflumilast treatment is uncertain, further 
research on its effect on dementia onset is likely valuable.

BACKGROUND: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell 
leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic 
paraparesis (HAM/TSP) with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness and health impact of HTLV-1 antenatal screening.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A state-transition model was developed for 
HTLV-1 antenatal screening and no screening over a lifetime horizon from a 
healthcare payer perspective. A hypothetical cohort of 30-year-old individuals 
was targeted. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
life expectancy life-years (LYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 
HTLV-1 carriers, ATL cases, HAM/TSP cases, ATL-associated deaths, and 
HAM/TSP-associated deaths. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at 
US$50,000 per QALY gained. In the base-case analysis, HTLV-1 antenatal screening 
(US$76.85, 24.94766 QALYs, 24.94813 LYs, ICER; US$40,100 per QALY gained) was 
cost-effective compared with no screening (US$2.18, 24.94580 QALYs, 24.94807 
LYs). Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the maternal HTLV-1 seropositivity 
rate, HTLV-1 transmission rate with long-term breastfeeding from HTLV-1 
seropositive mothers to children, and the cost of the HTLV-1 antibody test. 
HTLV-1 antenatal screening was cost-effective when the maternal HTLV-1 
seropositivity rate was greater than 0.0022 and the cost of the HTLV-1 antibody 
test was lower than US$94.8. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a 
second-order Monte-Carlo simulation showed that HTLV-1 antenatal screening was 
81.1% cost-effective at a WTP threshold of US$50,000 per QALY gained. For 
10,517,942 individuals born between 2011 and 2021, HTLV-1 antenatal screening 
costs US$785 million, increases19,586 QALYs and 631 LYs, and prevents 125,421 
HTLV-1 carriers, 4,405 ATL cases, 3,035 ATL-associated deaths, 67 HAM/TSP cases, 
and 60 HAM/TSP-associated deaths, compared with no screening over a lifetime.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: HTLV-1 antenatal screening is cost-effective and has 
the potential to reduce ATL and HAM/TSP morbidity and mortality in Japan. The 
findings strongly support the recommendation for HTLV-1 antenatal screening as a 
national infection control policy in HTLV-1 high-prevalence countries.

PURPOSE: To evaluate oncological outcomes of partial gland cryoablation (PGC) 
for localized prostate cancer (PCa) in a cohort of elderly patients who required 
an active treatment.
METHODS: Data from 110 consecutive patients treated with PGC for localized PCa 
were collected. All patients underwent the same standardized follow-up with 
serum-PSA level and digital rectal examination. Prostate MRI and eventual 
re-biopsy were performed at twelve months after cryotherapy or in case of 
suspicion of recurrence. Biochemical recurrence was defined according to Phoenix 
criteria (PSA nadir + 2 ng/ml). Kaplan-Meier curves and Multivariable Cox 
Regression analyses were used to predict disease progression, biochemical 
recurrence- (BCS) and additional treatment-free survival (TFS).
RESULTS: Median age was 75 years (IQR 70-79). PGC was performed in 54 (49.1%) 
patients with low-risk PCa, 42 (38.1%) with intermediate risk and 14 (12.8%) 
high risk. At a median follow-up of 36 months, we recorded a BCS and TFS of 75 
and 81%, respectively. At 5 years, BCS was 68.5% and CRS 71.5%. High-risk 
prostate cancer was associated with lower TFS and BCS curves when compared with 
low-risk group (all p values < .03). A PSA reduction < 50% between preoperative 
level and nadir resulted as an independent failure predictor for all outcomes 
evaluated (all p values < .01). Age was not associated with worse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: PGC could be a valid treatment for low- to intermediate PCa in 
elderly patients, when a curative approach is suitable in terms of life 
expectancy and quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined the difference in overall survival (OS) 
between peritoneal metastatic gastric cancer (PMGC) patients who underwent 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cytoreductive surgery ± hyperthermic 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS ± HIPEC) and those who did not have surgery 
but instead received palliative chemotherapy.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 80 patients who were followed up with 
the diagnosis of PMGC, those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by CRS 
± HIPEC (CRS ± HIPEC group) and those receiving chemotherapy only (non-surgical 
group), in the medical oncology clinic between April 2011 and December 2021. 
Clinicopathological features, treatments, and OS of the patients were compared.
RESULTS: There were 32 patients in the SRC CRS ± HIPEC group and 48 in the 
non-surgical group. In the CRS ± HIPEC group, CRS + HIPEC was performed on 20 
patients, and only CRS was performed on 12 patients. All of the patients who 
underwent CRS + HIPEC, and 5 of the patients who underwent only CRS received 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While the median OS was 19.7 (15.5-23.8) months in the 
CRS ± HIPEC group, the median OS was 6.8 (3.5-10.2) months in the non-surgical 
group (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: As a result, CRS + HIPEC significantly improves survival in PMGC 
patients. With experienced surgical centres and appropriate patient selection, 
the life expectancy of patients with PM can be extended.

Carotid Artery Stenting for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis: What We Need to Know 
for Treatment Decision.

School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

A clinical decision on the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis is 
challenging, unlike symptomatic carotid stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) 
has been recommended as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) based on 
the finding that the efficacy and safety of CAS were comparable to CEA in 
randomized trials. However, in some countries, CAS is often performed more 
frequently than CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Moreover, it has been 
recently reported that CAS is not superior to the best medical treatment in 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Due to these recent changes, the role of CAS in 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis should be revisited. When determining the 
treatment for asymptomatic carotid stenosis, one should consider several 
clinical factors including stenosis degree, patient life expectancy, stroke risk 
by medical treatment, availability of a vascular surgeon, high risk for CEA or 
CAS, and insurance coverage. This review aimed to present and pragmatically 
organize the information that is necessary for a clinical decision on CAS in 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In conclusion, although the traditional benefit 
of CAS is being revisited recently, it seems too early to conclude that CAS is 
no longer beneficial under intense and systemic medical treatment. Instead, a 
treatment strategy with CAS should evolve to select eligible or medically 
high-risk patients more precisely.

Introduction: malnutrition and sarcopenia are frequent in the population with 
liver cirrhosis and have a negative impact on the performance status and life 
expectancy of these patients. There are multiple assessment tools for 
malnutrition and sarcopenia in cirrhosis. Objective: to assess malnutrition and 
sarcopenia in liver cirrhosis and to compare the accuracy of diagnostic tools in 
this population. Method: a cross-sectional analytical study was conducted with 
convenience sampling by using continuous inclusion of patients with liver 
cirrhosis in a tertiary care center during December 2018 to May 2019. The 
nutritional assessment was carried out with arm anthropometry, body mass index 
(BMI), and the algorithm of the Royal Free Hospital Subjective Global Assessment 
(RFH-SGA). For the evaluation of sarcopenia, the hand grip strength test with a 
hand dynamometer was applied. The results were reported in measures of central 
tendency expressed in frequency and percentage. Results: a total of 103 patients 
were included with a predominance of the male gender (79.6 %) and a mean age of 
51 years (± 10). The etiology of liver cirrhosis corresponded more frequently to 
alcohol consumption (68 %) and most of the patients were Child-Pugh C (57.3 %) 
with a mean MELD of 21.9 (± 8.9). A mean BMI with dry weight of 25.2 kg/m2 was 
reported, and with respect to the WHO classification by BMI, 7.8 % were 
underweight and 59.2 % were malnourished by RFH-SGA. Sarcopenia was present in 
88.3 % using the hand grip strength test, for which a mean of 18.99 kg was 
found. A Kendall's Tau-b rank correlation coefficient was performed between BMI 
and RFH-SGA, which showed no statistically significant association, as well as 
between mean arm muscle circumference percentiles and hand grip strength. 
Conclusions: global assessment in liver cirrhosis should include screening for 
malnutrition and sarcopenia, for which validated, accessible and safe 
application tools should be used, such as anthropometric assessment, RFH-SGA, 
and hand grip strength.

Publisher: Introducción: la malnutrición y la sarcopenia son frecuentes en la 
población con cirrosis hepática y generan un impacto negativo en el estado 
funcional y la esperanza de vida de estos pacientes. Existen múltiples 
herramientas para la valoración de la malnutrición y la sarcopenia en los 
pacientes con cirrosis hepática. Objetivo: valorar la malnutrición y la 
sarcopenia en la cirrosis hepática y comparar distintas herramientas 
diagnósticas aplicables en esta población. Método: se realizó un estudio 
analítico de corte transversal con muestreo a conveniencia mediante inclusión 
continua de pacientes con cirrosis hepática en un hospital de tercer nivel 
durante diciembre de 2018 a mayo de 2019. Se realizó la valoración nutricional 
con la antropometría del brazo, el índice de masa corporal (IMC) y el algoritmo 
del Royal Free Hospital Subjetive Global Assessment (RFH-SGA). Para la 
valoración de la sarcopenia se aplicó la fuerza de agarre de la mano con un 
dinamómetro. Los resultados se reportaron en medidas de tendencia central 
expresadas en frecuencia y porcentaje. Resultados: se incluyeron un total de 103 
pacientes, predominando el género masculino (79,6 %), con una edad media de 51 
años. La etiología más frecuente de la cirrosis hepática fue el consumo de 
alcohol (68 %), predominando la clase Child-Pugh C (57,3 %) con una media de 
MELD de 21,9 (± 8,9). Se reportó una media de IMC con peso seco de 25,2 kg/m2 y, 
respecto a la clasificación de la OMS, un 7,8 % se encontraban en bajo peso y un 
59,2 % en malnutrición según la RFH-SGA. Un 88,3 % presentó sarcopenia al 
utilizar la fuerza de agarre de la mano, cuyo valor medio fue de 18,99 kg. Se 
realizó una correlación con Tau b de Kendall entre IMC y RFH-SGA sin 
evidenciarse ninguna asociación significativa, al igual que entre los 
percentiles de la circunferencia muscular media de brazo (MAMC) y la fuerza de 
agarre de la mano. Conclusiones: la valoración integral de la cirrosis hepática 
debe incluir el escrutinio de la malnutrición y la sarcopenia, existiendo 
herramientas de fácil acceso y aplicación segura validadas en esta población, 
como la valoración antropométrica, el RFH-SGA y la fuerza de agarre de la mano.

BACKGROUND: The objectives of this paper were to determine the overall number of 
diseases, deaths, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) caused by viral 
foodborne diseases (FBDs). An extensive search scheme was performed using 
several search terms; disease burden, foodborne disease, and foodborne viruses.
METHODS: The obtained results were subsequently screened based on title, 
abstract, and, finally, full text. Relevant evidence on human food-borne virus 
diseases (prevalence, morbidity, and mortality) was selected. Of all viral 
foodborne diseases, norovirus was the most predominant one.
RESULTS: The incidence rates of norovirus foodborne diseases ranged from 11 to 
2,643 cases in Asia and from 418 to 9,200,000 in the USA and Europe. Norovirus 
had a high burden of disease Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) compared 
with other foodborne diseases. North America was reported as a country with a 
high burden of disease (DALYs = 9900) and illness costs.
DISCUSSION: High variability of prevalence and incidence were observed in 
different regions and countries. Food-borne viruses pose a considerable burden 
on poor health throughout the world.
CONCLUSION: We suggest the addition of foodborne viruses to the global burden of 
disease, and relevant evidence can be used to improve public health.

INTRODUCTION: Early prevention of sarcopenia is a recommendation to reduce 
morbidity, mortality and improve quality of life. Several non-pharmacological 
interventions to reduce the risk of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older 
people have been proposed. Therefore, there is a need to identify the scope and 
differences of these interventions. This scoping review will summarise the 
nature and extent of the existing literature that describes and examines 
non-pharmacological interventions for community-dwelling older adults with 
possible sarcopenia or sarcopenia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The seven-stage review methodology framework will be used. 
Searches will be conducted in the following databases: Embase, Medline, 
PsycINFO, CINAHL, All EBM Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, CBM, CNKI, WANFANG 
and VIP. Grey literature will also be identified from Google scholar. Search 
dates will be restricted to January 2010 to December 2022, in English and 
Chinese language only. Screening will be focused on published research, 
including both quantitative and qualitative study designs, and prospectively 
registered trials. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews will be followed when delineating 
the search decision process. Findings will be synthesised quantitatively and 
qualitatively as appropriate and classified using key conceptual categories. We 
will identify whether studies identified have been included in systematic 
reviews or meta-analyses, and research gaps and opportunities will be identified 
and summarised.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this is a review, ethical approval will not be 
sought. The results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and 
also disseminated in relevant disease support groups and conferences. The 
planned scoping review will help us identify the current status of research and 
gaps in the literature, so as to develop a future research agenda.

Chitosan has gained agro-industrial interest due to its potential applications 
in food preservation. In this work, chitosan applications for exotic fruit 
coating, using feijoa as a case of study, were evaluated. For this, we 
synthetized and characterized chitosan from shrimp shells and tested its 
performance. Chemical formulations for coating preparation using chitosan were 
proposed and tested. Mechanical properties, porosity, permeability, and fungal 
and bactericidal characteristics were used to verify the potential application 
of the film in the protection of fruits. The results indicated that synthetized 
chitosan has comparable properties to commercial chitosan (deacetylation degree 
> 82%), and, for the case of feijoa, the chitosan coating achieved significant 
reduction of microorganisms and fungal growth (0 UFC/mL for sample 3). Further, 
membrane permeability allowed oxygen exchange suitable for fruit freshness and 
natural physiological weight loss, thus delaying oxidative degradation and 
prolonging shelf-life. Chitosan's characteristic of a permeable film proved to 
be a promising alternative for the protection and extension of the freshness of 
post-harvest exotic fruits.

Ophthalmic non-motor impairments are common in Parkinson's disease patients, 
from the onset of the neurodegenerative disease and even prior to the 
development of motor symptoms. This is a very crucial component of the potential 
for early detection of this disease, even in its earliest stages. Since the 
ophthalmological disease is extensive and impacts all extraocular and 
intraocular components of the optical analyzer, a competent assessment of it 
would be beneficial for the patients. Because the retina is an extension of the 
nervous system and has the same embryonic genesis as the central nervous system, 
it is helpful to investigate the retinal changes in Parkinson's disease in order 
to hypothesize insights that may also be applicable to the brain. As a 
consequence, the detection of these symptoms and signs may improve the medical 
evaluation of PD and predict the illness' prognosis. Another valuable aspect of 
this pathology is the fact that the ophthalmological damage contributes 
significantly to the decrease in the quality of life of patients with 
Parkinson's disease. We provide an overview of the most significant 
ophthalmologic impairments associated with Parkinson's disease. These results 
certainly constitute a large number of the prevalent visual impairments 
experienced by PD patients.
