Spatially varying baseline data can help identify and prioritise actions 
directed to determinants of intra-urban health inequalities. Twenty-seven years 
(1990-2016) of cause-specific mortality data in British Columbia, Canada were 
linked to three demographic data sources. Bayesian small area estimation models 
were used to estimate life expectancy (LE) at birth and 20 cause-specific 
mortality rates by sex and year. The gaps in LE for males and females ranged 
from 6.9 years to 9.5 years with widening inequality in more recent years. 
Inequality ratios increased for almost all causes, especially for HIV/AIDS and 
sexually transmitted infections, maternal and neonatal disorders, and neoplasms.

Recently, rice contamination by heavy metals (HMs) has become a severe problem. 
Taking the Western Fujian region as an example in this study, a total of 1311 
rice samples containing eight HMs were collected from 2015 to 2019, then used to 
explore their pollution characteristics, health risks, and Spatio-temporal 
variations, finally derive the target remediation areas of the key pollutants. 
The results showed that average concentrations of all the HMs had not reached 
the limits of the National Standards of Food Safety, but pollution indexes of As 
(0.783) and Cu (0.665) were at accumulation level (>0.6), which posed high 
pollution risks. Furthermore, locations of higher HMs concentrations coincided 
with those of higher pollution estimation probabilities. The non-carcinogenic 
risk (4.150, 2.434) and carcinogenic risk (4.96 × 10-3, 2.92 × 10-3) for 
children and adults cannot be negligible, As and Cd were the largest 
contributors. Children were more susceptible than adults due to the metal 
concentrations and rice intake rate. The spatio-temporal changes indicated that 
a decreasing trend in average concentrations of HMs (except Cr), but As 
(0.37%-0.88%) contents increased in the west and northeast parts, and so did Cd 
(1.92%-5.11%) in the central region during monitoring. For the target 
remediation, particular regions in the western and eastern were used as risky 
areas of As and Cd, respectively. Our results will provide theoretical support 
for the pollution management of HMs in rice.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening compared to no screening in the Korean 
population from societal and healthcare system perspectives.
METHODS: A published decision-tree plus Markov model was used to compare the 
expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) between one-time universal 
HCV screening and no screening in the population aged 40-65 years using the 
National Health Examination (NHE) program. Input parameters were obtained from 
analyses of the National Health Insurance claims data, Korean HCV cohort data, 
or from the literature review. The population aged 40-65 years was simulated in 
a model spanning a lifetime from both the healthcare system and societal 
perspectives, which included the cost of productivity loss due to HCV-related 
deaths. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between universal 
screening and no screening was estimated.
RESULTS: The HCV screening strategy had an ICER of $2,666/QALY and $431/QALY 
from the healthcare system and societal perspectives, respectively. Both ICERs 
were far less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of $25,000/QALY, showing 
that universal screening was highly cost-effective compared to no screening. In 
various sensitivity analyses, the most influential parameters on 
cost-effectiveness were the antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) prevalence, screening 
costs, and treatment acceptance; however, all ICERs were consistently less than 
the threshold. If the anti-HCV prevalence was over 0.18%, screening could be 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: One-time universal HCV screening in the Korean population aged 40-65 
years using NHE program would be highly cost-effective from both healthcare 
system and societal perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Participation in regular physical activity (RPA) is beneficial to 
the quality of life and life expectancy of patients with chronic heart failure 
(CHF). However, it is inadequate in many patients.
AIMS: To determine the factors that influence the practice of RPA in patients 
with CHF managed in general practice.
METHOD: This was a qualitative study using semistructured, individual 
face-to-face interviews. Patients with CHF (New York Heart Association Stages 
1-3) capable of participating in RPA were enrolled by their general 
practitioner. A longitudinal and transversal inductive thematic analysis was 
performed by two researchers.
RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the 19 interviews that were conducted. Poor 
knowledge of the disease and the benefits of participating in RPA, as well as 
the lack of motivation or enjoyment, in particular due to the absence of 
previous participation, were considered significant obstacles. Fear associated 
with CHF or other comorbidities was also an obstacle. Attendance at a 
rehabilitation center, family and social circles, and having a pet all appeared 
to be beneficial. Family and friends were important for motivating the patient 
to participate in an activity but could also be an obstacle when they were 
overprotective.
CONCLUSION: This study helps highlight the difficulties for patients with CHF 
associated with participation in RPA. Despite the obstacles, there are enabling 
factors on which the general practitioner may rely to motivate their patients.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common disease which affects around 40% of children and 
30% of reproductive age women and can have major health consequences. The 
present study reports the global, regional and national burden of anemia and its 
underlying causes between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index 
(SDI).
METHODS: Publicly available data on the point prevalence and years lived with 
disability (YLDs) were retrieved from the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 
study for 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019. The point 
prevalence, YLD counts and rates per 100,000 population were presented, along 
with their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global age-standardized point prevalence and YLD rates for 
anemia were 23,176.2 (22,943.5-23,418.6) and 672.4 (447.2-981.5) per 100,000 
population, respectively. Moreover, the global age-standardized point prevalence 
and YLD rate decreased by 13.4% (12.1-14.5%) and 18.8% (16.9-20.8%), 
respectively, over the period 1990-2019. The highest national point prevalences 
of anemia were found in Zambia [49327.1 (95% UI: 46,838.5-51,700.1)], Mali 
[46890.1 (95% UI: 44,301.1-49,389.8)], and Burkina Faso [46117.2 (95% UI: 
43,640.7-48,319.2)]. In 2019, the global point prevalence of anemia was highest 
in the 15-19 and 95+ age groups in females and males, respectively. Also, the 
burden of anemia was lower in regions with higher socio-economic development. 
Globally, most of the prevalent cases were attributable to dietary iron 
deficiency, as well as hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic anemias.
CONCLUSIONS: Anemia remains a major health problem, especially among females in 
less developed countries. The implementation of preventive programs with a focus 
on improving access to iron supplements, early diagnosis and the treatment of 
hemoglobinopathies should be taken into consideration.

Eristalinus aeneus (Scopoli, 1763) is a suitable candidate for artificial 
rearing due to its pollination efficiency and subcosmopolitan distribution. 
However, the high mortality found at the larval stage of this species needs to 
be overcome. In this research, two different larval media were used to study the 
life cycle of E. aeneus: brewery spent grain (BSG) from a local craft-beer 
factory and soaked oat grains (SOG). The age-stage, two-sex life table method 
was used to analyze the results, which were compared using the paired bootstrap 
test. The greatest mortality was found at the larval stage with both media. 
Individuals fed on SOG presented a shorter preadult developmental time (22.05 
days) than those reared with BSG (26.97 days). This fact had a direct impact on 
the total preoviposition period, it being shorter with SOG (34.36 days) than BSG 
(38.29 days), although the second provided a larger total number of eggs (19,242 
eggs) and a faster adult maturation (10.67 days). The population parameters 
indicated that both populations will display a positive growth under the studied 
conditions, being the mean generation time (T) significantly shorter when using 
SOG (38.71 days) than BSG (45.95 days). Despite the preadult results pointing to 
SOG being a more efficient medium, the promising fecundity values provided by 
BSG, as well as it's lower cost and ecological benefits, suggest that this 
second medium could be improved and used as an alternative to SOG in the near 
future.

Health problems of women experiencing homelessness are driven either from the 
usual background characteristics of this population, or from the homeless 
lifestyle. Apart from poverty and unemployment, transition to homelessness is 
often associated with substance abuse, history of victimization, stress, poor 
mental health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Water insecurity can 
undermine bodily hygiene and dental health, posing a greater risk of dehydration 
and opportunistic infections. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions like 
heat waves and natural disasters increases morbidity, accelerates aging, and 
reduces life expectancy. Nutrition-wise, a high prevalence of food insecurity, 
obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies are apparent due to low diet quality and 
food waste. Poor hygiene, violence, and overcrowding increase the susceptibility 
of these women to communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted ones and 
COVID-19. Furthermore, established cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus 
are often either undertreated or neglected, and their complications are more 
widespread than in the general population. In addition, lack of medical 
screening and contraception non-use induce a variety of reproductive health 
issues. All these health conditions are tightly related to violations of human 
rights in this population, including the rights to housing, water, food, 
reproduction, health, work, and no discrimination. Thus, the care provided to 
women experiencing homelessness should be optimized at a multidimensional level, 
spanning beyond the provision of a warm bed, to include access to clean water 
and sanitation, psychological support and stress-coping strategies, disease 
management and acute health care, food of adequate quality, opportunities for 
employment and support for any minor dependants.

INTRODUCTION: Heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower 
respiratory disease, and stroke are the 5 leading causes of death in the U.S. 
The objective of this review is to examine the economic value of prevention 
interventions addressing these 5 conditions.
METHODS: Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry data were 
queried from 2010 to 2018 for interventions that addressed any of the 5 
conditions in the U.S. Results were stratified by condition, prevention stage, 
type of intervention, study sponsorship, and study perspective. The analyses 
were conducted in 2020, and all costs were reported in 2019 dollars.
RESULTS: In total, 549 cost-effectiveness analysis studies examined 
interventions addressing these 5 conditions in the U.S. Tertiary prevention 
interventions were assessed in 61.4%, whereas primary prevention was assessed in 
8.6% of the studies. Primary prevention studies were predominantly funded by 
government, whereas industry sources funded more tertiary prevention studies, 
especially those dealing with pharmaceutical interventions. The median 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the 5 conditions combined was $68,500 
per quality-adjusted life year. Median incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were lowest for primary prevention and highest for tertiary prevention.
DISCUSSION: Primary prevention may be more cost effective than secondary and 
tertiary prevention interventions; however, research investments in primary 
prevention interventions, especially by industry, lag in comparison. These 
findings help to highlight the gaps in the cost-effectiveness analysis 
literature related to the 5 leading causes of death and identify understudied 
interventions and prevention stages for each condition.

BACKGROUND: Lateral epicondylitis is degenerative tendinosis of the extensor 
carpi radialis brevis muscle and is the most common work/sports-related chronic 
musculoskeletal problem affecting the elbow.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the short term and residual effectiveness 
of the Kinesio taping method on pain, grip force, quality of life, and 
functionality.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, controlled study.
METHODS: Subjects were 50 patients diagnosed with chronic unilateral lateral 
epicondylitis with a symptom duration of at least 12 weeks. During the first 
four weeks, the study group received a true inhibitor Kinesio taping while the 
control group received sham taping. In both groups, progressive stretching and 
strengthening exercises were given as a home program for six weeks. The primary 
outcome measure was the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for self-report of pain 
intensity; secondary outcome measures were Cyriax resistive muscle test 
evaluation, maximal grip strength, Patient- Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation 
(PRTEE), and Short Form-36 (SF-36). After the treatment, patients were evaluated 
by the first assessor who was blinded to taping types.
RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in NRS scores overtime during the 
first four weeks in both groups (P < .001,) and effect sizes were large. There 
was no significant difference in Cyriax muscle resistance test maximal grip 
strength between groups (P > .05). However, there was a significant improvement 
in muscle strength of elbow extension and pronation in the study group detected 
in the intragroup analysis. Intragroup comparisons also showed a significant 
improvement in all subunits of the PRTEE and SF-36 except energy/vitality, 
social functioning, and pain in both groups (P < .05) with moderate to high 
effect sizes. PRTEE pain scores were significantly decreased in the study group 
compared to the placebo group (P < .05, d = 0.48).
CONCLUSION: The effects of Kinesio taping on muscle strength, quality of life, 
and function in chronic lateral epicondylitis are not superior to placebo. 
However, NRS scores showed that in the two weeks after Kinesio taping treatment, 
pain reduction persisted as a residual effect which may improve the exercise 
adherence and functionality.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Screening for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 
asymptomatic adults is not recommended, however, patients with new-onset 
diabetes (NoD) have an 8 times higher risk of PDAC than expected. A novel 
risk-tailored early detection strategy targeting high-risk NoD patients might 
improve PDAC prognosis. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this 
strategy.
METHODS: We compared PDAC early detection strategies targeting NoD individuals 
age 50 years and older at various minimal predicted PDAC risk thresholds vs 
standard of care in a Markov state-transition decision model under the health 
care sector perspective using a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year, the early detection strategy targeting patients with 
a minimum predicted 3-year PDAC risk of 1% was cost effective (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, $116,911). At a WTP threshold of $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year, the early detection strategy at the 2% risk 
threshold was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $63,045). 
The proportion of PDACs detected at local stage, costs of treatment for 
metastatic PDAC, utilities of local and regional cancers, and sensitivity of 
screening were the most influential parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis confirmed that at a WTP threshold of $150,000, early detection at the 
1.0% risk threshold was favored (30.6%), followed by the 0.5% risk threshold 
(20.4%) vs standard of care (1.7%). At a WTP threshold of $100,000, early 
detection at the 1.0% risk threshold was favored (27.3%) followed by the 2.0% 
risk threshold (22.8%) vs standard of care (2.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: A risk-tailored PDAC early detection strategy targeting NoD 
patients with a minimum predicted 3-year PDAC risk of 1.0% to 2.0% may be cost 
effective.

For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the role of physical activity 
in reducing COPD mortality and heart loading and in extending life expectancy 
remains unclear. Participants in comprehensive medical screening were recruited 
with spirometry on everyone. We analyzed physical activity volume calculated 
from intensity, duration and frequency of self-reported exercise history. Deaths 
were identified from the National Death File. The impacts of physical activity 
on mortality, heart rate and life expectancy were analyzed. Among the cohort of 
483,603 adults, 32,535 had spirometry-determined COPD, indicating an adjusted 
national prevalence of 11.4% (male) and 9.8% (female). On the average, COPD 
increased all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.44 and loss of 6.0 years 
in life expectancy. Almost two thirds (65%) of the causes of deaths were 
extra-pulmonary, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and kidney 
diseases. In addition, COPD was associated with increases in heart rate 
proportionate to its severity, which led to higher mortality. Participants with 
COPD who were fully active physically could reduce mortality and have improved 
heart rates as compared with those without physical activity. In addition, their 
life expectancy could be extended close to those of the no COPD but inactive 
cohort. Fully active physical activity can help patients with COPD overcome most 
of the mortality risks, decrease heart rate, and achieve a life expectancy close 
to that of patients without COPD. The effectiveness of physical activity on COPD 
is facilitated by its systemic nature beyond lung disease.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology in neurosurgery has gained popularity 
nowadays. Skull base contains many major neurovascular structures in a confined 
space, along with anatomical variations making surgical approaches to this 
region challenging. 3D-printed model of skull base tumors consists of the 
patient's bony skull base, actual tumor dimensions, and surrounding major 
neurovascular structures. We included a total number of five patients with skull 
base tumors (one case of planum sphenoidale meningioma, two cases of sellar 
tumor with suprasellar extension, and two cases of cerebellopontine angle tumor) 
and 3D-printed tumor model of each of them. These models were used for 
preoperative simulation and served as very true to life training tool. These 
help in increasing the efficacy of the surgeon, improves surgical safety and 
ergonomics. They were also used for patient counselling, educating about the 
disease, the surgical procedure, and associated risks.

A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed 
Tomography and a Diagnostic Biomarker.

BACKGROUND: The Lung Computed Tomography Screening Reporting and Data System 
(Lung-RADS) reduces the false-positive rate of lung cancer screening but 
introduces prolonged periods of uncertainty for indeterminate findings. We 
assess the cost-effectiveness of a screening program that assesses indeterminate 
findings earlier via a hypothetical diagnostic biomarker introduced in place of 
Lung-RADS 3 and 4A guidelines.
METHODS: We evaluated the performance of the US Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) recommendations on lung cancer screening with and without a 
hypothetical noninvasive diagnostic biomarker using a validated microsimulation 
model. The diagnostic biomarker assesses the malignancy of indeterminate 
nodules, replacing Lung-RADS 3 and 4A guidelines, and is characterized by a 
varying sensitivity profile that depends on nodules' size, specificity, and 
cost. We tested the robustness of our findings through univariate sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: A lung cancer screening program per the USPSTF guidelines that 
incorporates a diagnostic biomarker with at least medium sensitivity profile and 
90% specificity, that costs $250 or less, is cost-effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio lower than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year, and 
improves lung cancer-specific mortality reduction while requiring fewer 
screening exams than the USPSTF guidelines with Lung-RADS. A screening program 
with a biomarker costing $750 or more is not cost-effective. The health benefits 
accrued and costs associated with the screening program are sensitive to the 
disutility of indeterminate findings and specificity of the biomarker, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening that incorporates a diagnostic biomarker, in 
place of Lung-RADS 3 and 4A guidelines, could improve the cost-effectiveness of 
the screening program and warrants further investigation.

Understanding the needs of low-income countries: how urologists can help.

Payne SR(1), Chalwe M(2).

Delivering urological humanitarian aid to countries with greater need has been 
provided by urologists associated with British Association of Urological 
Surgeons (BAUS) Urolink over the last 30 years. Urolink has realised the need to 
understand where that need is geographically, what tangible help is required, 
and how assistance can be delivered in the most ethically appropriate way. The 
World Bank stratification of countries by per capita gross national income has 
helped in the identification of low-come countries or lower-middle-income 
countries (LMICs), the vast majority of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. The 
medical and socioeconomic needs of those country's populations, which constitute 
17% of the global community, are substantially different from that required in 
higher income countries. More than 40% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is 
aged <14 years, it has a substantially reduced life expectancy, which influences 
the type of pathologies seen, and perinatal complications are a major cause of 
morbidity for both mother and child. There is a significant problem with the 
availability of medical care in these countries and almost a third of global 
deaths have been attributed to the lack of access to emergency and elective 
surgery. Urologically, the main conditions demanding the attention of the very 
few available urologists are congenital anomalies, benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
urolithiasis, urethral stricture, and pelvic cancer. The management of these 
conditions is often substantially different from that in the UK, being limited 
by a lack of personnel, equipment, and access to geographically relevant 
guidelines appropriate to the healthcare environment. Assisting LMICs to develop 
sustainable urological services can be helped by understanding the local needs 
of linked institutions, establishing trusting and durable relationships with 
partner centres and by providing appropriate education that can be perpetuated, 
and disseminated, across a region of need.

[The role of antiviral therapy in the management of patients with liver 
cirrhosis associated with chronic HBV and HCV infection].

[Article in Russian]

of Russia.

The formation of the liver cirrhosis (LC) is an unfavorable event of the natural 
history of chronic liver diseases being accompanied by complications that often 
cause a fatal outcome. The study of the effectiveness of drugs that affect 
various etiopathogenetic mechanisms of this condition is an urgent problem of 
modern hepatology.The aim of the review was to show the role of antiviral 
therapy (AVT) in the management of patients with LC associated with chronic HBV 
(hepatitis B virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection.PubMed database, 
Google Scholar search engine, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, eLIBRARY.RU 
electronic scientific library, as well as the reference lists of articles were 
used to search for scientific articles. The relevant objectives of the review of 
the publications were identified for the period since 2000 up to 2021 by the 
search queries as following: «liver cirrhosis», «liver fibrosis», «chronic HBV 
infection», «chronic HCV infection», «portal hypertension», «treatment». The 
inclusion criteria were restricted to the management of patients with LC 
associated with chronic HBV and HCV infection.Current guidelines recommend 
indefinite treatment of patients with HBV-associated LC with nucleos(t)ide 
analogues regardless of serum HBV DNA levels, while the modern concept of using 
direct-acting antiviral drug combinations has become the standard treatment for 
HCV-associated cirrhosis. Studies have shown the ability of AVT to inhibit and 
reverse fibrotic processes in LC associated with chronic HBV and HCV infection. 
It has also been reported that HBV/HCV eradication prior to orthotopic liver 
transplantation improves long-term overall survival.This, in turn, can reduce 
the severity of portal hypertension and decrease the risk of associated 
complications, as well as normalize liver function. Thus, ensuring the 
availability of drugs for those in need of AVT will not only help prevent the 
development of LC, but also improve the quality of life and increase its 
expectancy of patients suffering from this disease.

Adults on the autism spectrum are affected by health disparities which 
significantly reduce life expectancy and experience barriers to accessing 
healthcare. Social prescribing is a holistic approach that diverts patients from 
primary care to health-enhancing activities in communities. However, there has 
been a lack of research attention to how autistic people navigate the social 
prescribing pathway and the ability of these approaches to address existing 
disparities. This mapping review aimed to synthesise features of non-medical, 
community-based interventions for autistic adults to assess their suitability 
for a social prescribing approach. A systematic search and screening process was 
used to identify literature reviews from medical databases (Embase, Medline, 
PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane reviews) and grey literature. We extracted data 
from 24 reviews and 19 studies including types of services, participants, 
outcomes, settings and procedures. A narrative and visual synthesis is used to 
map the variety of services and interventions identified, the outcome measures 
used, and the barriers and facilitators to progression through services in 
relation to a realist social prescribing framework. The review found that there 
has been minimal evaluation of holistic, low intensity services for autistic 
adults, such as those offered in social prescribing approaches. Outcome measures 
remain focused on features of autism and reveal less about the effects of 
interventions on health and wellbeing. Aspects of the social prescribing model 
were identified in the features of service pathways, but findings also suggested 
how social prescribing could be adapted to improve accessibility for autistic 
people.

Improving glycaemia level is helpful to the clinician in diabetes management. 
Elderly diabetics make up a group that is non-homogeneous and with a very varied 
health status, whose treatment must be adjusted to take into account 
comorbidities, degree of frailty and both functional and mental disability, in 
addition to their life expectancy and personal preferences. Thus, the target of 
treatment should be defined along three categories of patients: robust, 
vulnerable and dependent. This article reviews information from the literature 
high-lighting current recommendations for treatment, the clear inclination 
towards overtreatment of the elderly diabetic and the resulting noxious effects 
of occurring hypoglycemia, that are often not recognized by the patient and his 
doctor.

Publisher: Améliorer la valeur glycémique guide le clinicien dans la prise en

fonctionnel que psychique, l’espérance de vie, ainsi que les préférences du 
patient. Ainsi, les cibles de traitement pourront être définies en répartissant 
les patients en trois catégories : solides, vulnérables et dépendants. Cet 
article passe en revue les données de la littérature en illustrant les 
recommandations actuelles de prise en charge, la tendance marquée au 
surtraitement du sujet âgé diabétique et les effets délétères de la survenue 
d’hypoglycémies souvent non identifiées par le patient et son médecin.

The increasing life expectancy, the earlier detection of terminal illnesses and 
the increasing complexity of care pathways led us to propose an innovative 
response within the Neuchâtel Hospital Network (RHNe), in the form of a mixed 
intra-hospital mobile team (GSPmob), composed of doctors and nurses from 
geriatrics and palliative care. Through geriatric and palliative assessment, we 
are able to highlight the patient's different medical problems. Our team, after 
two years of existence, has met our patients' needs as well as the hospital 
teams' needs. And yet we encountered certain challenges. Our current objective 
is to describe our experience by presenting our results and difficulties.

AIMS: To estimate the spatiotemporal patterns in infective endocarditis (IE) 
burden along with its attributable risk factors at the national, regional, and 
global levels, which is essential to optimize the targeted prevention, clinical 
practice, and research.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on all available data sources, the incidence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of IE in 204 countries and 
regions from 1990 to 2019 were reconstructed by Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019 using the Cause of Death Ensemble model, spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression, and DisMod-MR 2.1. We depicted the epidemiological characteristics 
of IE in detail by gender, region, and age. Globally, 1 090 527 incident cases, 
66 322 deaths, and 1 723 594 DALYs of IE were estimated in 2019. The 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized mortality rate 
(ASMR) increased from 9.91 and 0.73 to 13.80 and 0.87 per 100 000 person-years 
over the past 30 years, respectively. ASIR were consistently more pronounced in 
higher socio-demographic index (SDI) regions. The leading ASMR in 2019 appeared 
in the High SDI region, with the largest increase in the past three decades. The 
age-specific burden rate of IE among people over 25 years old usually increased 
with age, and the annual increasing trend was more obvious for people over 
60 years of age, especially in higher SDI regions.
CONCLUSION: The incidence and mortality of IE have continued to rise in the past 
30 years, especially in higher SDI regions. The patient population was gradually 
shifting from the young to the elderly.
