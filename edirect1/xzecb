BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a crucial risk factor for developing cardiovascular 
disease and reducing life expectancy. We aimed to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) 
variants potentially related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) by conducting epigenome-wide association studies in 60 and 
59 Chinese monozygotic twin pairs, respectively.
METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood of twins was 
performed using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, yielding 551,447 
raw CpGs. Association between DNAm of single CpG and blood pressure was tested 
by applying generalized estimation equation. Differentially methylated regions 
(DMRs) were identified by comb-P approach. Inference about Causation through 
Examination of Familial Confounding was utilized to perform the causal 
inference. Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Genomic Regions 
Enrichment of Annotations Tool. Candidate CpGs were quantified using Sequenom 
MassARRAY platform in a community population. Weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted using gene expression data.
RESULTS: The median age of twins was 52 years (95% range 40, 66). For SBP, 31 
top CpGs (p < 1 × 10-4) and 8 DMRs were identified, with several DMRs within 
NFATC1, CADM2, IRX1, COL5A1, and LRAT. For DBP, 43 top CpGs (p < 1 × 10-4) and 
12 DMRs were identified, with several DMRs within WNT3A, CNOT10, and DAB2IP. 
Important pathways, such as Notch signaling pathway, p53 pathway by glucose 
deprivation, and Wnt signaling pathway, were significantly enriched for SBP and 
DBP. Causal inference analysis suggested that DNAm at top CpGs within NDE1, 
MYH11, SRRM1P2, and SMPD4 influenced SBP, while SBP influenced DNAm at CpGs 
within TNK2. DNAm at top CpGs within WNT3A influenced DBP, while DBP influenced 
DNAm at CpGs within GNA14. Three CpGs mapped to WNT3A and one CpG mapped to 
COL5A1 were validated in a community population, with a hypermethylated and 
hypomethylated direction in hypertension cases, respectively. Gene expression 
analysis by WGCNA further identified some common genes and enrichment terms.
CONCLUSION: We detect many DNAm variants that may be associated with blood 
pressure in whole blood, particularly the loci within WNT3A and COL5A1. Our 
findings provide new clues to the epigenetic modification underlying 
hypertension pathogenesis.

Nature provides a successful evolutionary direction for single-celled organisms 
to solve complex problems and complete survival tasks - pseudopodium. Amoeba, a 
unicellular protozoan, can produce temporary pseudopods in any direction by 
controlling the directional flow of protoplasm to perform important life 
activities such as environmental sensing, motility, predation, and excretion. 
However, creating robotic systems with pseudopodia to emulate environmental 
adaptability and tasking capabilities of natural amoeba or amoeboid cells 
remains challenging. Here, this work presents a strategy that uses alternating 
magnetic fields to reconfigure magnetic droplet into Amoeba-like microrobot, and 
the mechanisms of pseudopodia generation and locomotion are analyzed. By simply 
adjusting the field direction, microrobots switch in monopodia, bipodia, and 
locomotion modes, performing all pseudopod operations such as active 
contraction, extension, bending, and amoeboid movement. The pseudopodia endow 
droplet robots with excellent maneuverability to adapt to environmental 
variations, including spanning 3D terrains and swimming in bulk liquids. 
Inspired by the "Venom," the phagocytosis and parasitic behaviors have also been 
investigated. Parasitic droplets inherit all the capabilities of amoeboid robot, 
expanding their applicable scenarios such as reagent analysis, microchemical 
reactions, calculi removal, and drug-mediated thrombolysis. This microrobot may 
provide fundamental understanding of single-celled livings, and potential 
applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.

INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of cemiplimab in recurrent cervical cancer has been 
demonstrated in the clinical trial EMPOWER-Cervical 1. However, its high price 
makes patients and clinicians hesitate to use it. Therefore, we designed a study 
to evaluate its cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model based on phase III clinical trials to 
calculate the cost, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over 20 years with a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY. The economic data included 
were obtained from official US government websites and published literature. 
Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the uncertainties associated with the 
model, and a subgroup analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Compared with chemotherapy, cemiplimab produced an additional 0.597 
QALYs (0.751 LYs), resulting in an ICER of $111,211.471/QALY in the United 
States. The cost of cemiplimab is the most influential factor in the model. The 
results of these models were robust in all sensitivity analyses. From the 
American public payers' perspective, subgroup analysis showed cemiplimab was a 
cost-effective regimen in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, 
or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) ≥ 1%.
CONCLUSION: From the American public payers' perspective, cemiplimab is a 
cost-effective treatment option for second-line treatment of recurrent cervical 
cancer. Meanwhile, cemiplimab was a cost-effective treatment for patients with 
PD-L1 ≥ 1 and all histological types.

Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins are one of the most widespread 
marine biotoxins that affect aquaculture and human health, and their detection 
has become crucial. In this study, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) 
with non-destructive characteristics was used to identify DSP toxins in Perna 
viridis. The spectral data of the DSP toxin-contaminated and non-contaminated 
Perna viridis samples were acquired in the 950-1700 nm range. To solve the 
discrimination of spectra with crossover and overlapping, a discriminative 
non-negative representation-based classifier (DNRC) has been proposed. Compared 
with collaborative and non-negative representation-based classifiers, the DNRC 
model exhibited better performance in detecting DSP toxins, with a 
classification accuracy of 99.44 %. For a relatively small-scale sample dataset 
in practical applications, the performance of the DNRC model was compared with 
those of classical models. The DNRC model achieved the best results for both 
identification accuracy and F-measure, and its detection performance did not 
significantly decrease with decreasing sample size. The experimental results 
validated that a combination of NIRS and the DNRC model can facilitate rapid, 
convenient, and non-destructive detection of DSP toxins in Perna viridis.

Antibiotics help in preventing and treating infections and increasing life 
expectancy globally. Globally, many people's lives are being threatened by the 
emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The cost of treating and preventing 
infectious diseases has increased due to AMR. Bacteria can resist the effects of 
antibiotics by altering drug targets, inactivating drugs, and activating drug 
efflux pumps. According to estimates, five million individuals died in 2019 from 
AMR-related causes, wherein 1.3 million deaths were directly linked to bacterial 
AMR. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experienced the greatest mortality rate from AMR 
in 2019. In this article, we discuss AMR's causes and challenges SSA faces in 
implementing AMR prevention measures and propose recommendations to address the 
challenges. Antibiotic misuse and overuse, widespread usage in agriculture, and 
the pharmaceutical industry's absence of new antibiotic development are the 
factors contributing to AMR. SSA's challenges in preventing AMR include poor AMR 
surveillance and lack of collaboration, irrational use of antibiotics, weak 
medicine regulatory systems, lack of infrastructural and institutional 
capacities, lack of human resources, and inefficient infection prevention and 
control (IPC) practices. The challenges faced by countries in SSA can be 
addressed by increasing the public's knowledge of antibiotics and AMR, promoting 
antibiotic stewardship, improving AMR surveillance, promoting collaboration 
within and beyond countries, antibiotics regulatory enforcement, and improving 
the practice of IPC measures at home, food handling establishments, and 
healthcare facilities.

BACKGROUND: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with improvements 
in cardiovascular health, and consensus guidelines recommend that individuals 
with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) participate 
in regular physical activity. However, most adults do not achieve recommended 
levels of physical activity. Concepts from behavioral economics have been used 
to design scalable interventions that increase physical activity over short time 
periods, but the longer-term efficacy of these strategies is uncertain.
STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: BE ACTIVE (NCT03911141) is a pragmatic, virtual, 
randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 
strategies informed by behavioral economic concepts to increase daily physical 
activity in patients with established ASCVD or 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5% who are 
seen in primary care and cardiology clinics affiliated with the University of 
Pennsylvania Health System. Patients are contacted by email or text message, and 
complete enrollment and informed consent on the Penn Way to Health online 
platform. Patients are then provided with a wearable fitness tracker, establish 
a baseline daily step count, set a goal to increase daily step count by 33% to 
50%, and are randomized 1:2:2:2 to control, gamification, financial incentives, 
or both gamification and financial incentives. Interventions continue for 12 
months, with follow-up for an additional 6 months to evaluate the durability of 
behavior change. The trial has met its enrollment goal of 1050 participants, 
with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in daily steps over the 12-month 
intervention period. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in 
daily steps over the 6-month post-intervention follow-up period and change in 
moderate to vigorous physical activity over the intervention and follow-up 
periods. If the interventions prove effective, their effects on life expectancy 
will be compared with their costs in cost-effectiveness analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: BE ACTIVE is a virtual, pragmatic randomized clinical trial powered 
to demonstrate whether gamification, financial incentives, or both are superior 
to attention control in increasing physical activity. Its results will have 
important implications for strategies to promote physical activity in patients 
with or at risk for ASCVD, as well as for the design and implementation of 
pragmatic virtual clinical trials within health systems.

Classically, patients with solid and hematologic malignancies have been treated 
with a combination of chemotherapy with or without a holistic targeted strategy 
using approved conventional therapy. While the evidence-based use of 
Immunomodulatory drugs and Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including those 
targeting the PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4, have reshaped the treatment paradigm for 
many malignant tumors and significantly stretched the life expectancy of 
patients, as for any interventional therapy, the rise in ICI applications, was 
associated with the observation of more immune-related hematological adverse 
events. Many of these patients require transfusion support during their 
treatment in line with precision transfusion. It has been presumed that 
transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) and the microbiome can pose 
immunosuppressive effects on the recipients. Looking to the past and beyond and 
translating available data into practice in the evolving role of pharmaceutical 
therapy to ICI-receiving patients, we performed a narrative review of the 
literature on the immune-related hematological adverse events of ICIs, 
immunosuppressive mechanisms linked to blood product transfusions, as well as 
the detrimental impact of transfusions and its related microbiome on the 
sustained efficacy of ICIs and the patients' survival outcomes. Recent reports 
are pointing to the negative impact of transfusion on ICI response. Studies have 
concluded that packed RBC [PRBC] transfusions lead to an inferior 
progression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced cancer receiving 
ICIs, even after adjustments for other prognostic variables. The attenuation of 
the effectiveness of immunotherapy likely results from the immunosuppressive 
effects of PRBC transfusions. It is, therefore, wise to look retrospectively and 
prospectively at the impact of transfusion on ICI effects and adopt, in the 
interim, a restrictive transfusion strategy, if applicable, for those patients.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a major public health problem, as it is a main 
cause of otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, sepsis, and 
meningitis. Acute episodes of pneumococcal disease have been demonstrated to 
cause organ damage with lingering negative consequences. Cytotoxic products 
released by the bacterium, biomechanical and physiological stress resulting from 
infection, and the corresponding inflammatory response together contribute to 
organ damage accrued during infection. The collective result of this damage can 
be acutely life-threatening, but among survivors, it also contributes to the 
long-lasting sequelae of pneumococcal disease. These include the development of 
new morbidities or exacerbation of pre-existing conditions such as COPD, heart 
disease, and neurological impairments. Currently, pneumonia is ranked as the 9th 
leading cause of death, but this estimate only considers short-term mortality 
and likely underestimates the true long-term impact of disease. Herein, we 
review the data that indicates damage incurred during acute pneumococcal 
infection can result in long-term sequelae which reduces quality of life and 
life expectancy among pneumococcal disease survivors.

BACKGROUND: Identifying the temporal trends of cirrhosis and liver cancer 
attributable to alcohol use in both the past and the future can formulate the 
control strategies.
METHODS: Data on cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to alcohol use from 
1990 to 2019, including mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates 
were collected from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. To analyze 
the temporal trends, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) was calculated, 
and the Bayesian age-period-cohort model was applied.
RESULT: Deaths and DALY of cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to alcohol 
use increased year by years, but the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and 
age-standardized DALY rate declined or remained stable from 1990 to 2019 in most 
regions of the world. The burden of cirrhosis attributable to alcohol increased 
in low-middle social-development index (SDI) regions, while the burden of liver 
cancer increased in high-SDI regions. Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the 
highest burden of cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by alcohol use. Deaths and 
DALYs are mainly distributed in people aged 40+ years, but there is an 
increasing trend in people aged under 40 years. New deaths from cirrhosis and 
liver cancer attributable to alcohol use are predicted to increase in the next 
25 years, but the ASDR of cirrhosis in males will increase slightly.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the age-standardized rate of cirrhosis and liver cancer 
due to alcohol use have decreased, the absolute burden increased and will 
continue to increase. Therefore, alcohol control measures should be further 
strengthened and improved through effective national policies.

BACKGROUND: The life spans of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) patients have been extended in the era of 
antiretroviral therapy. However, few studies have considered the influence of 
the environment on the life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS. Several 
studies have investigated mortality and air pollution associations, but the 
evidence for associations between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) 
and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients remains extremely sparse.
METHODS: We conceived a dynamic cohort study by enrolling people with HIV/AIDS 
from 103 counties in Hubei province, China from 2010 to 2019, with 23,809 
persons and 78,457.2 person-years of follow-up. The county-level annual 
concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were extracted from the ChinaHighAirPollutants 
dataset. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposures were 
conducted to assess the associations between PM and mortality.
RESULTS: Per 1 μg/m3 increased in PM2.5 and PM10 would elevate 0.69 % (95 % CIs: 
0.39, 1.00) and 0.39 % (95 % CIs: 0.18, 0.59) risk of all-cause deaths (ACD) and 
1.65 % (95 % CIs: 1.14, 2.17) and 0.90 % (95 % CIs: 0.56, 1.24) of AIDS-related 
deaths (ARD), respectively. Significantly stronger associations of PM-ARD were 
found in patients aged over 60 years old, with corresponding excess risk of 
2.66 % (95 % CIs: 1.76, 3.58) for PM2.5 and 1.62 (95 % CIs: 1.01, 2.23) for 
PM10.
CONCLUSIONS: This study added to the existing evidence that long-term exposure 
to ambient PM adversely affects the life spans of HIV/AIDS patients. Hence, 
public health departments should take proactive measures to prevent further life 
loss and promote survival among those living with HIV/AIDS.

This paper introduced the overview of the &quot;eight trends&quot; of Chinese 
medicinal materials(CMM) industry in 2021, analyzed the problems of CMM 
production, and put forward development suggestions. Specifically, &quot;eight 
trends&quot; could be summarized as follows.(1) The growing area of CMM tended 
to be stable, and some provinces began to release the local catalog of Dao-di 
herbs.(2) The protection process of new varieties accelerated, and a number of 
excellent varieties were bred.(3) The theory of ecological cultivation was 
further enriched, and the demonstration effect of ecological cultivation 
technology was prominent.(4) Some CMM realized complete mechanization and formed 
typical model cases.(5) The number of cultivation bases using the traceability 
platform increased, and provincial internet trading platforms were set up.(6) 
The construction of CMM industrial clusters accelerated, and the number of 
provincial-level regional brands increased rapidly.(7) Many new agricultural 
business entities were founded nationwide, and a variety of methods were used to 
drive the intensified development of CMM.(8) A number of local TCM laws were 
promulgated, and the management regulation of food and medicine homology 
substances catalogs was issued. On this basis, four suggestions for CMM 
production were proposed.(1) It is suggested to speed up the formulation of the 
national catalog of Dao-di herbs and carry out the certification of Dao-di herbs 
production bases.(2) Ecological planting of forest and grassland medicine should 
be further strengthened in terms of technical research and promotion based on 
the principle of ecological priority.(3) The basic work of disaster prevention 
should be paid more attention and technical measures for disaster mitigation 
should be developed.(4) The planted area of commonly used CMM should be 
incorporated into the national regular statistical system.

Oral health is vital for the general well-being, overall body health and the 
quality of life throughout our lifetime. Most of the oral diseases and 
conditions are largely related to the maintenance of oral hygiene, lacking that 
people suffer from diverse oral diseases at different times in their life. With 
greater life expectancy, the individuals have teeth involved with periodontal 
diseases that would not only require professional care but also home gum care 
for them to last a lifetime. Indian Society of Periodontology (ISP) has 
recognized the need for systematic documents to update everyday clinical 
practice of general dental practitioners and have provided evidence-based 
consensus documents, namely good clinical practice recommendations from time to 
time to raise the oral health-related awareness and standards of oral healthcare 
delivery across the country. The current set of clinical practice 
recommendations focused to "Gum Care for All", is aimed at emphasizing and 
enhancing the awareness regarding oral health promotion, maintenance, and 
disease prevention. Twenty-five subject matter experts from across the nation, 
prepared these recommendations after a thorough literature review and group 
discussions. The document has been prepared in three distinct sections, namely 
pretherapeutic, therapeutic, and post therapeutic, to provide guidance during 
the respective phases of patient management and may serve as a quick and concise 
reference to the readers. The guidelines shall provide the distinct definitions, 
signs and symptoms, treatment required; recall visit specifications for 
plausible clinical case situations, home care advice regarding maintenance of 
oral hygiene including information on brushing technique, care and change of 
brush, use of interdental aids, and mouthwashes, etc. The document should 
advocate and guide the combined efforts of general dentists, and the population 
at large toward an empowered, evidence based, integrated, and comprehensive oral 
health care, which shall enhance the healthful functioning and longevity of the 
dentition and general health of the individual.

People often provide caregiving to other family members across the life course. 
"Sandwiched" caregiving, or caring for a child and aging parent at the same 
time, is a common form of combining care duties. However, adults share more 
years of life with many different family members due to population level 
demographic shifts in life expectancy and family formation. This shift means 
that multigenerational care, or providing for two or more different generations 
of family members simultaneously, may better reflect the reality of caregiving 
for contemporary cohorts of adults. Although there is strong public backing for 
providing supports to caregivers, current policies are often limited.

BACKGROUND: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a common microvascular 
complication of both type 1 and 2 diabetes with substantial morbidity burden and 
reduced quality of life. Its association with mortality is equivocal.
PURPOSE: To describe the association between DSPN and all-cause mortality in 
people with diabetes and further stratify by the type of diabetes based on a 
meta-analysis of published observational studies.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline from inception to May 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Original data were collected from case-control and cohort 
studies that reported on diabetes and DSPN status at baseline and all-cause 
mortality during follow-up.
DATA EXTRACTION: was completed by diabetes specialists with clinical experience 
in neuropathy assessment.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Data was synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis. The 
difference between type 1 and 2 diabetes was investigated using meta-regression.
RESULTS: A total of 31 cohorts (n=155,934 participants, median 27.4% with DSPN 
at baseline, all-cause mortality 12.3%) were included. Diabetes patients with 
DSPN had an almost twofold mortality (HR: 1.96, 95%CI: 1.68-2.27, I2 = 91.7%), 
I2 = 91.7%) compared to those without DSPN that was partly explained by baseline 
risk factors (adjusted HR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.37-1.87, I2 = 78.86%). The association 
was stronger in type 1 compared to type 2 diabetes (HR: 2.22, 95%CI: 1.43-3.45). 
Findings were robust in sensitivity analyses without significant publication 
bias.
LIMITATIONS: Not all papers reported multiple adjusted estimates. The definition 
of DSPN was heterogeneous.
CONCLUSIONS: DSPN is associated with an almost twofold risk of death. If this 
association is causal, targeted therapy for DSPN could improve life expectancy 
of diabetic patients.

L-carnitine is a low molecular weight amino acid that plays an essential role in 
the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. The regulatory effects and molecular 
mechanisms of L-carnitine on fat and protein metabolism in common carp (Cyprinus 
carpio) were investigated in this study. Common carp (n = 270) were randomly 
divided into three groups and fed either (1) common carp diet, (2) 
high-fat/low-protein diet, or (3) L-carnitine-high-fat/low-protein diet. Growth 
performance, plasma biochemistry, muscle composition, and ammonia excretion rate 
were all examined after 8 weeks. Additionally, each group's hepatopancreas was 
subjected to transcriptome analysis. The results showed that decreasing the feed 
protein/fat ratio resulted in a considerable increase in feed conversion ratio 
and a significant decrease in common carp-specific growth rate to 1.19 ± 0.02 (P 
< 0.05). Similarly, total plasma cholesterol sharply increased to 10.15 ± 2.07, 
while plasma urea nitrogen, muscle protein, and ammonia excretion levels dropped 
(P < 0.05). After adding L-carnitine to the high-fat/low-protein diet, it was 
found that the specific growth rate and protein content of the dorsal muscle 
increased significantly (P < 0.05). In contrast, the plasma total cholesterol 
and ammonia excretion rate decreased considerably at most time points after 
feeding (P < 0.05). The expression of genes in the hepatopancreas differed 
substantially between the different groups. Through GO analysis, it was 
demonstrated that L-carnitine increased the ability of fat decomposition by 
up-regulating the expression of cpt1 in the hepatopancreas and decreased the 
expression of fasn and elovl6 to reduce the production and extension of lipids. 
Simultaneously, mtor was more abundant in the hepatopancreas, implying that 
L-carnitine can increase protein synthesis. According to the findings, adding 
L-carnitine to high-fat/low-protein diets can stimulate growth by enhancing 
lipolysis and protein synthesis.

The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing and poses serious health risks 
accompanied by a decrease in life expectancy and quality of life. Therefore, the 
therapeutic potential of natural-derived nutraceuticals against obesity and its 
comorbidities needs to be explored. Molecular inhibition of lipase enzymes and 
fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein has attracted some recent interest 
in efforts to find antiobesity agents. This study aims to innovate a fermented 
drink from Clitoria ternatea kombucha (CTK), find out their metabolites profile, 
and determine the antiobesity potential through a molecular docking study. The 
CTK formulation refers to previous research while the metabolites profile was 
determined using HPLC-ESI-HRMS/MS. Major compounds were selected based on best 
match value > 99.0% of the M/Z cloud database. A total of 79 compounds were 
identified in CTK, and 13 ideal compounds were selected to be simulated in the 
molecular docking study against human pancreatic lipase, α-amylase, 
α-glucosidase, porcine pancreatic lipase, and FTO proteins. The study found that 
Kaempferol, Quercetin-3β-D-glucoside, Quercetin, Dibenzylamine, and 
α-Pyrrolidinopropiophenone showed the best potential as functional antiobesity 
compounds since their affinity value ranked high in each respective receptor. In 
conclusion, the major compounds of CTK metabolites have the potential to be 
promising functional foods against obesity. However, further in vitro and in 
vivo studies should validate these health benefits.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate post-exercise outcomes related to function 
and quality of life in people with ALS.
METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were used for identifying and extracting articles. 
Levels of evidence and quality of articles were judged based on The Oxford 
Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence and the QualSyst. Outcomes 
were analyzed with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V2 software, random effects 
models, and Hedge's G. Effects were examined at 0-4 months, up to 6 months, 
and > 6 months. Pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed for 1) 
controlled trials vs. all studies and 2) ALSFRS-R bulbar, respiratory, and motor 
subscales. Heterogeneity of pooled outcomes was computed with the I2 statistic.
RESULTS: 16 studies and seven functional outcomes met inclusion for the 
meta-analysis. Of the outcomes explored, the ALSFRS-R demonstrated a favorable 
summary effect size and had acceptable heterogeneity and dispersion. While FIM 
scores demonstrated a favorable summary effect size, heterogeneity limited 
interpretations. Other outcomes did not demonstrate a favorable summary effect 
size and/or could not be reported due to few studies reporting outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides inconclusive guidance regarding exercise 
regimens to maintain function and quality of life in people with ALS due to 
study limitations (e.g., small sample size, high attrition rate, heterogeneity 
in methods and participants, etc.). Future research is warranted to determine 
optimal treatment regimens and dosage parameters in this patient population.

INTRODUCTION: Rhizobacterial communities and their metabolites can affect plant 
growth, development, and stress resistance, as well as the biosynthesis and 
accumulation of bioactive compounds in medicinal plants. This relationship has 
been well-characterized in many medicinal herbs, although much less commonly in 
medicinal trees.
METHODS: Here, we analyzed the composition and structure of Cinnamomum migao 
rhizobacterial communities across nine growing regions in Yunnan, Guizhou and 
Guangxi, China, as well as differences in soil properties and fruit bioactive 
compounds.
RESULTS: Results showed that the C. migao rhizobacterial communities exhibited 
high species richness, but location-specific differences in structure. 
Site-specific differences in soil properties and bioactive compounds were also 
observed. Furthermore, rhizobacterial community compositions were correlated 
with both soil properties and fruit bioactive compounds, metabolism-related 
functions were most common in C. migao rhizobacteria.
DISCUSSION: Several bacterial genera, including Acidothermus, Acidibacter, 
Bryobacter, Candidatus_Solibacter, and Acidimicrobiales, potentially promote the
