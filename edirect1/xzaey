are amenable to clinical and public health efforts.

BACKGROUND: Clotting factor products have been safe for HIV since 1985, and for 
hepatitis C since 1992. Few studies have reported on mortality in the total 
population of hemophilia patients after the period of risk of viral infection 
transmission.
OBJECTIVES: We studied the mortality, causes of death, and life expectancy of 
hemophilia patients between 1992 and 2001. We compared these findings with those 
of previous cohorts, together spanning the periods before, during, and after the 
use of potentially contaminated clotting products.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study among 967 patients 
with hemophilia A and B. Death rates, overall and cause-specific, were compared 
with national mortality figures for males adjusted for age and calendar period 
as standardized mortality ratio (SMRs).
RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2001, 94 (9.7%) patients had died and two patients 
were lost to follow-up (0.2%). Mortality was 2.3-times higher in hemophilia 
patients than in the general male population (SMR 2.3 95% confidence interval 
1.9-2.8). In patients with severe hemophilia, life expectancy decreased from 63 
(1972-1985) to 59 years (1992-2001). Exclusion of virus-related deaths resulted 
in a life expectancy at birth of 72 years.
CONCLUSIONS: AIDS was the main cause of death (26%) and 22% of deaths were 
because of hepatitis C. In patients not affected by viral infections, there 
still appeared to be a trend toward a moderately increased mortality compared 
with the Dutch male population. Thus, mortality of patients with hemophilia is 
still increased; this is largely because of the consequences of viral 
infections.

Cost-effectiveness of inhaled steroids in asthma: impact of effect on bone 
mineral density.

BACKGROUND: The effects of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) preparations on bone 
health have been debated. Multiple analyses have been published examining the 
question, with mixed results.
OBJECTIVES: We examined how assumptions about the effect of ICS on bone mineral 
density (BMD) influence the cost-effectiveness of ICS in asthma.
METHODS: We developed a mathematical simulation model to estimate clinical 
outcomes and costs for a cohort with mild/moderate asthma. The analysis 
conformed to reference case recommendations of the US Panel on 
Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Sensitivity analysis evaluated the 
stability of our results to uncertainty in treatment duration, age at treatment, 
and ICS dose.
RESULTS: Assuming a dose of 200 microg twice per day of ICS, a literature-based 
average effect of ICS on BMD and a 10-year time horizon, we observed a minimal 
increase in the costs attributed to hip fracture and incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio of $26,000 per quality-adjusted life-year and $14.00 per 
symptom-free day gained. Over an extended the time horizon (lifetime), the 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio increased to $42,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year. Only under a scenario of high-dose ICS, a lifetime horizon, and a 
large effect of ICS on BMD did the potential impact of ICS on BMD dramatically 
affect the economic attractiveness of therapy.
CONCLUSION: To minimize any potential impact, use of the lowest effective dose 
of ICS and measures to target and intervene in high-risk individuals are 
warranted. However, ICS therapy in mild/moderate asthma compares favorably with 
commonly accepted interventions over a wide range of assumptions regarding this 
treatment and its effects on BMD.

More than one million Americans have been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). Advances in prevention and treatment of HIV have led to an 
increased life expectancy for patients with HIV infection. Due to their 
increased life span, HIV+ patients are now presenting to hospitals with an 
increased number of diverse late-stage complications, such as cardiomyopathy and 
other cardiovascular conditions. These complications are as a direct or indirect 
result of HIV disease, HIV treatment modalities, comorbid conditions, dietary 
and lifestyle factors, and unknown etiologies. Cardiac complications, 
particularly HIV-related dilated cardiomyopathy, are potentially 
life-threatening diagnoses, with symptoms that may be minimized with appropriate 
cardiac-specific assessments and treatments, patient teaching, and collaboration 
among nurses caring for the HIV-positive client with cardiac disease.

roycrowninshield@comcast.net

There has been a substantial change in the population demographics of patients 
who potentially will require total joint replacements. We studied data regarding 
temporal trends in physical condition, life expectancy, education, and other 
population demographics of individuals most likely to receive total joint 
replacements. Changes in this population during the last several decades 
correlate with temporal changes in the prevalence of joint disease and the 
incidence of total hip and knee replacements. Compared with several decades ago, 
patients currently receiving total joint replacements are almost 20% heavier, 
more physically active, three times more likely to have a high school or college 
education, and live more than 25% longer. Patients needing total joint 
replacements are more likely to be female, and twice as likely to receive a 
total knee replacement than a total hip replacement. Treatment choices and 
outcome expectations are best determined with accurate knowledge of current 
surgical science and current patient demographics. Therefore, it is important to 
realize that today's population most likely to receive total joint replacements 
is demographically different than in the past.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies on the natural history of unruptured intracranial 
aneurysms dictate that we reevaluate the risks and benefits of surgical 
intervention as it compares with the natural course. We analyzed the outcome of 
surgical clipping of a patient cohort with unruptured aneurysms as it compares 
with a 10 year nonclipping survival period on the basis of two previously 
published studies (International Study on Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms and 
a study by Juvela et al. [36] from Helsinki).
METHODS: Data on 148 unruptured aneurysms in 116 consecutive surgically treated 
patients were prospectively recorded and retrospectively analyzed. The overall 
majority were diagnosed with cerebral angiography. Data analyzed included 
aneurysmal properties and clinical outcomes including surgical related 
mortalities and morbidities. The observed outcomes were compared with the 
expected outcome of a 10 year nonclipping survival period if the patient cohort 
was included in recently reported studies on unruptured aneurysms. More than 1 
year follow-up was available in 93.1% (108) of patients and follow-up cerebral 
angiography was performed in 80% (93) of patients.
RESULTS: Mean age was 53.57 years. There were 25 (16.8%) small aneurysms (less 
than 7 mm), 70 (47.2%) aneurysms 7 to 12 mm in size, 41 (27.70%) large (13-24 
mm), and 12 (8.10%) giant (>25 mm) aneurysms. Posterior circulation aneurysm 
comprised 13.51%. One hundred forty-three (96.62%) aneurysms were successfully 
clipped, and 3.37% were either wrapped or later coiled. Surgical-related 
mortality was 0.82% (1 patient because of air embolism). Surgical related 
permanent morbidity was 3.44% (4 patients) and transient surgical-related mild 
morbidities was 7.7% (9 patients). Immediate postsurgical good outcome (Glasgow 
Outcome Score = 4-5) was 87.93% (102 patients) and 95.68% in 3 months (111 
patients). At 1 year, the modified Rankin scale scores were 0 to I = 102, II = 
3, III = 2, IV = 1, and V = 0. Residual aneurysms were seen in none of the 
postoperative angiograms (93 patients). Using the chi method, the comparison of 
the expected to the observed mortality and morbidity revealed a statistically 
significant difference in the mortality in favor of surgical clipping (P = 0.034 
when compared with the International Study on Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms 
and P = 0.05 when compared with the Juvela et al. [36] study). There was no 
statistically significant difference in the permanent morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Studies on natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms 
suggest 10 year cumulative bleeding-related mortality and severe morbidity of no 
less than 7.5%. In our study, surgical clipping resulted in an 0.8% rate of 
mortality and 3.4% permanent morbidity. This suggests that surgical clipping has 
the potential of a superior outcome to the natural history of patients who have 
an estimated life expectancy of no less than 10 years.

Although numerous studies are available in the literature on endocrine 
complications in thalassaemia, little is known about this subject in developing 
countries. Therefore, an international multicenter study was conducted in a 
large series of children and adolescents with beta thalassaemia major in order 
to obtain more information on the prevalence of short stature and endocrine 
complications in different areas of the world and to elucidate the problems that 
must be dealt with in the future. A questionnaire was sent to 29 Centres 
treating a total of 3817 beta thalassaemia major patients. Thirty-six per cent 
of patients were over the age of 16 years. Short stature was present in 31.1% of 
males and 30.5% of females, and the prevalence of growth hormone deficiency was 
7.9% in males and 8.8% in females. Lack of pubertal changes was the most common 
endocrine complication (40.5%) followed by hypoparathyroidism (6.9%), impaired 
glucose tolerance (6.5%), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (3.2%) and primary 
hypothyroidism (3.2%). The prevalence of endocrine complications differed among 
centres, particularly for growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism and 
hypothyroidism. Compliance to chelation therapy was poor in 51% of patients and 
serum liver enzymes were high in 65% of patients. Since several endocrine glands 
may be affected in patients with thalassaemia major, and their life expectancy 
is now much longer, it is important that physicians be aware of the endocrine 
abnormalities that may develop. Therefore, periodic evaluation of these problems 
should be carried out in thalassaemic patients with iron overload, particularly 
after the age of 11 years. In conclusion, since iron overload and liver damage 
seem to be the most important factors responsible for endocrine complications, 
adequate compliance to chelation therapy and rigid precautions against liver 
infections are imperative.

Therapy insight: Therapeutic challenges in the treatment of elderly cancer 
patients.

Lichtman SM(1).

Author information:
(1)Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. lichtmas@mskcc.org

People over the age of 65 years constitute the fastest-growing segment of the US 
population. Within the next 30 years, this group will comprise over 20% of the 
total population. Importantly, 50% of all cancers and 70% of cancer mortality 
occur in this age group. Choosing the correct chemotherapy regimen and dose for 
the older patient can be extremely difficult because of physiological changes 
that occur with aging, as well as other comorbidities associated with this age 
group. Treatment decisions need to be based on a patient's individual 
performance, functional status and life expectancy. Although there are no 
accepted algorithms to guide management decisions in elderly cancer patients, 
data are becoming available that will help guide the use of chemotherapy in the 
older patient population.

Comment in
    Bull World Health Organ. 2005 Dec;83(12):883.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify development assistance for health to countries 
of central and eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CEE-CIS).
METHODS: We used the International Development Statistics database of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the database on 
development assistance for health compiled for the Commission on Macroeconomics 
and Health to quantify health development assistance to the region, compared to 
global and overall development assistance. We based our analysis on standard 
health indicators, including child mortality, life expectancy at birth and 
health expenditures.
FINDINGS: Although total development assistance per capita to CEE-CIS was higher 
than that for most other regions of the world, development assistance for health 
was very low compared to other countries with similar levels of child mortality, 
life expectancy at birth and national expenditures on health.
CONCLUSION: The allocation of development assistance for health on a global 
scale seems to be related far more to child mortality rather than adult 
mortality. Countries of CEE-CIS have a high burden of adult morbidity and 
mortality from non-communicable diseases, which does not appear to attract 
proportionate development assistance. Levels of development assistance for 
health should be determined in consideration of the region's particular burden 
of disease.

Healthy life expectancy in Brazil: applying the Sullivan method.

Romero DE(1), Leite Ida C, Szwarcwald CL.

Author information:

Janeiro, Brazil. dalia@cict.ficruz.br

The objective of this study is to present the method proposed by Sullivan and to 
estimate the healthy life expectancy using different measures of state of 
health, based on information from the World Health Survey carried out in Brazil 
in 2003. By combining information on mortality and morbidity into a unique 
indicator, simple to calculate and easy to interpret, the Sullivan method is 
currently the one most commonly used for estimating healthy life expectancy. The 
results show higher number of healthy years lost if there is a long-term disease 
or disability that limits daily activities, regardless of the difficulty in 
performing such activities or the severity of the functional limitations. The 
two measures of healthy life expectancy adjusted by the severity of functional 
limitation show results very similar to estimates based on the perception of 
state of health, especially in advanced age. It was also observed, for all 
measures used, that the proportion of healthy years lost increases significantly 
with age and that, although females have higher life expectancy than males, they 
live proportionally less years in good health.

Evolution of human longevity, population pressure and the origins of warfare.

Holliday R(1).

Author information:
(1)RandL.Holliday@big pond.com

In a protected environment, humans have the longest lifespan of all primates. 
However, during the emergence of Homo sapiens from pre-hominids, the expectation 
of life at birth would have been quite low. On the basis of reasonable 
assumptions, an average expectation of life of less than 20 years is sufficient 
to maintain a population of hunter-gatherers. As individuals became better 
adapted to their environment, the mortality rate would gradually decrease, and 
this would result in the survival of more offspring to adulthood. Thus, the 
population will increase, and one of the consequences in human evolution is the 
migration of human communities to many new habitats. The development of 
agriculture provided a more reliable source of food, and stimulated further the 
increase in population size. Villages became towns, and then cities, states and 
empires arose which had very large populations, and competed for land and other 
resources. Armies were raised and were often at war. All this was due to 
population pressure, as Malthus had realised more than 200 years ago. However, 
neither he, nor any of the others who discussed warfare, understood that the 
demographic changes that produced large human populations was a steady increase 
in the expectation of life at birth. This inevitably occurred at the same time 
as man gradually gained more control over his environment, and achieved far more 
reproductive success than is seen in hunter-gatherers living in a harsh, 
stressful environment.

[Peri-interventional risk in 1,384 cardiac catheterizations in patients aged 80 
years or older].

j.niebauer@salk.at

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because of the rising life expectancy in the 
industrialized countries, ever more cardiac catheterizations are performed in 
patients aged 80 years or older. Little is known about the incidence of 
peri-interventional events in this age group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and September 2000, a total of 1,085 
patients of that age (mean 82.6 +/- 2.6 years) underwent cardiac catheterization 
and intervention (3% of a total of 43,517 cardiac catheterizations).
RESULTS: 827 patients (77%) had significant coronary artery stenoses. 373 of 
them (45%) were treated with balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, and 
331 (40%) underwent aortocoronary bypass procedures. 31 patients died while in 
hospital, 17 of them having been in cardiogenic shock on admission. 
Peri-interventional events, including damage to artery at the site of catheter 
entry occurred in 2.1% of patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization 
and in 11.6% in connection with a percutaneous interventional procedure.
CONCLUSION: Both cardiac catheterization and interventional procedures can be 
done with a justifiable risk in patients aged 80 years or older. These cardiac 
investigations/interventions should not be withheld in this group of patients 
for reasons of age.

Medical management and adjuvant therapies in spinal metastatic disease.

Schuster JM(1), Grady MS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania 19107, USA. schustej@uphs.upenn.edu

Metastatic spinal tumors are an increasingly common and difficult problem 
encountered by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. To improve therapies and 
increase life expectancy for patients with tumors such as those of the breast 
and prostate, a global, systematic approach is required to maximize the 
preservation of neurological function, maintenance of spinal stability, and 
relief of pain, all with the ultimate goal of improved functional capacity and 
quality of life (QOL). Although radiotherapy and surgery are still the primary 
therapeutic options, several new adjuvant therapies initially implemented to 
control pain more effectively have also been shown to reduce overall 
skeleton-related complications (pathological fractures and hypercalcemia) and 
may ultimately improve and extend QOL. This more global approach to spinal 
metastases also includes optimizing each patient's overall medical condition and 
potential for healing (that is, nutrition), as well as avoiding potential 
complications associated with metastatic disease (such as deep vein thrombosis), 
including excessive blood loss in the case of renal metastasis. A thorough 
knowledge and understanding of these therapeutic adjuvants is required to 
optimize care and to respond to our increasingly medically knowledgable patient 
population whose access to prevalent medical information has been increased 
because of the internet.

This paper reports the results of a study that used discrete choice experiment 
(DCE) methodology to estimate quality weights for a of social care outcome 
measure. To reflect different states of need, a five-dimensional profile measure 
was developed. Experimental design techniques were used to derive a sample of 
states for which preferences were elicited. The DCE approach was employed to 
elicit values and regression techniques used to estimate a model that could 
predict index scores for all 243 possible outcomes. The utility model, estimated 
on the basis of 297 responses, had good test-retest reliability and converged 
with preferences elicited from a rating exercise.

Disability is a burden to individuals and society. Population ageing, combined 
with the fact that disability is most common among the elderly, has focused 
attention on trends in old-age disability. This study estimates trends in 
functioning and disability among Japanese elderly from 1993 to 2002 and 
contrasts the patterns with those found in the USA. Japan is an especially 
interesting country because its age structure is relatively old, and it 
currently has the highest life expectancy in the world despite the fact that 
just 50 years ago its life expectancy was in the bottom half of all countries. 
As in the USA, disability rates have fallen. If it were not for the gains in 
disability between 1993 and 2002, there would have been 1.1 million more 
disabled elderly in 2002. The reductions were experienced broadly across 
socio-demographic and economic groups. Increases in education across cohorts are 
associated with the declines in disability.

DESIGN: The Diabetes Prevention Trial-1 screened more than 90,000 nondiabetic 
relatives of patients for cytoplasmic islet-cell autoantibody (ICA) expression 
between 1994 and 2002.
SETTING: The study was conducted in the general community.
PARTICIPANTS: The Diabetes Prevention Trial-1 found 2817 ICA-positive relatives 
who were tested for biochemical autoantibodies (GAD65, ICA512, and insulin) and 
HLA-DQ haplotypes, and 2796 of them were followed up for progression to diabetes 
for up to 8 yr (median, 3.6 yr).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progression to T1DM was measured.
RESULTS: High-risk DQ haplotypes and genotypes were associated with a higher 
percentage of relatives expressing multiple biochemical autoantibodies and 
higher T1DM risk (e.g., respectively, 59 and 36% at 5 yr for carriers of the 
DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302/DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype). The number of autoantibodies 
expressed significantly increased T1DM risk and across different DQ genotypes, 
autoantibody positivity directly correlated with diabetes risk. However, 
multivariate analyses indicated that the influence of most genotypes on T1DM 
risk was not independent from autoantibody expression, with the possible 
exception of DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602. Specific genotypic combinations conferred 5-yr 
diabetes risks significantly lower (e.g. 
7%-DQA1*0201-DQB1*0201/DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 and 
14%-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0301/DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201) than when those haplotypes were 
found in other combinations.
CONCLUSION: HLA DQ alleles determine autoantibody expression, which is 
correlated with diabetes progression. Among autoantibody-positive relatives, 
most HLA DQ genotypes did not further influence T1DM risk.

recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy].

BACKGROUND: Although technically challenging, salvage radical prostatectomy 
(SRP) for radiorecurrent prostate cancer (PCA) is an effective option in 
carefully selected patients and offers the chance for cure and long-term 
survival. Sometimes local progression of PCA with subvesical obstruction 
following radiation therapy requires radical cystoprostatectomy or 
bladder-preserving urinary diversion. We present our experience with salvage 
radical prostatectomy in a group of 28 consecutive patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and August 2005, 25 patients 
underwent radical salvage surgery for locally recurrent PCA following external 
beam radiation (n=14), high-dose brachytherapy (n=8), and low-dose brachytherapy 
(n=6). All men had biopsy-proved recurrent or persistent PCA associated with PSA 
progression following radiation therapy. Preoperative imaging studies included 
bone scintigraphy and computed tomography without evidence of metastatic 
disease. Of the 28 men, 11 (39%) presented with bothersome irritative voiding 
dysfunction and rectal discomfort. Life expectancy was >10 years in all cases. 
We analyzed preoperative symptoms, treatment-associated morbidity, 
pathohistological findings, and functional and oncological outcome after a mean 
follow-up of 12.5 (2-29) months.
RESULTS: SRP was performed in all cases without significant intra- and 
perioperative complications: no rectal lacerations or ureteral lesions were 
encountered and mean blood loss was 520 (200-950) ml. A total of 21 (75%) men 
underwent SRP: in 4 cases radical cystoprostatectomy was necessary due to 
bladder neck infiltration and in 3 men SRP with bladder neck closure and 
continent appendicovesicostomy was performed due to preexisting urinary stress 
incontinence. All men with subvesical obstruction experienced significant relief 
of urgency and significant irritative voiding dysfunction following radical 
salvage surgery. Pathohistological analysis of the prostatectomy specimen 
revealed pT1-2b PCA in 19 (67.8%), pT3a/b PCA in 5 (17.8%), and lymph node 
metastasis or positive surgical margins in 7% of the patients. Two patients 
demonstrated a pT0 despite positive preoperative biopsies, and 20% demonstrated 
a Gleason score 8-10. With regard to functional outcome, 25% of the men need 2-3 
pads daily whereas 78% of the men are continent. After a mean follow-up of 12.5 
(2-29) months, two patients with pT3b and pN1 status exhibit a PSA relapse.
CONCLUSION: Salvage RP or RCx is a technically challenging but feasible surgical 
approach with curative intent for the treatment of locally recurrent PCA in well 
selected patients preventing significant local complications such as subvesical 
obstruction, ureteral obstruction, hematuria, and rectal infiltration. 
Surgery-associated morbidity and complications are low and not comparable to 
earlier series. The indication for salvage RP requires positive biopsy and 
negative imaging studies.

Decision analysis for small, asymptomatic intracranial arteriovenous 
malformations.

Hampshire 03756, USA.

OBJECT: Asymptomatic intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent a 
clinically challenging problem because of the complex decision making that must 
be undertaken prior to beginning any type of treatment. In addition, the 
relative infrequency of these lesions means that there is relatively little 
experience reported in the literature. The authors use a decision-analysis 
technique to model the considerations that go into determining the treatment of 
these lesions in an effort to quantify the various risks and overall benefits 
conferred by the following three treatment strategies: observation/natural 
history, microsurgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery.
METHODS: The authors conducted a thorough literature search to elucidate the 
risks and outcomes associated with each treatment option. These values were used 
to build and run a comprehensive Markov model to determine a base-case analysis. 
All of the input variables were also subjected to sensitivity analysis to 
identify the most influential input variables and the crossover points in which 
favored strategies changed. The base-case analysis suggested that microsurgery 
was the favored treatment option because this hypothetical cohort accumulated 
21.53 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the course of the model compared 
with the 16.97 QALYs and 16.40 QALYs for stereotctic radiosurgery and 
observation, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that overall major 
neurological morbidity and mortality were the most influential input variables 
both perioperatively and during the radiosurgical "latent" period (that is, up 
to 2 years posttreatment). The maximum acceptable perioperative combined major 
neurological morbidity and mortality rate was 6.8%. The latent period combined 
major neurological morbidity and mortality would need to be 0.7% to make 
radiosurgery favorable in this analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this decision analysis model suggest that microsurgery 
in the hands of experienced cerebrovascular surgeons, who can expect a less than 
6.8% combined rate of major neurological morbidity and mortality, offers 
patients a greater overall quality of life over time.

Should patients have a greater role in valuing health states?

Currently, health state values are usually obtained from members of the general 
public trying to imagine what the state would be like rather than by patients 
who are actually in the various states of health. Valuations of a health state 
by patients tend to vary from those of the general population, and this seems to 
be due to a range of factors including errors in the descriptive system, 
adaptation to the state and changes in internal standards. The question of whose 
values are used in cost-effectiveness analysis is ultimately a normative one, 
but the decision should be informed by evidence on the reasons for the 
differences. There is a case for obtaining better informed general population 
preferences by providing more information on what it is like for patients 
(including the process of adaptation).

Determining priority for liver transplantation: a comparison of cost per QALY 
and discrete choice experiment-generated public preferences.

UK. j.ratcliffe@sheffield.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: A comparison of the implications of the application of the principles 
of equity and efficiency as two desirable but competing attributes of the organ 
allocation system. Efficiency is defined in economic terms as the standard cost 
per QALY model and equity considerations are included in a model based on public 
preferences generated from a discrete choice experiment in determining priority 
for donor liver graft allocation.
METHODS: A survey of the general public (n = 303) using a discrete choice 
experiment was undertaken. The results enabled estimation of the relative 
weights attached to several key factors which might be used to prioritise 
patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. These weights were then 
used to develop a patient-specific index (PSI) for all patients diagnosed with 
one of three main chronic liver diseases who had received a liver transplant 
during an 18-month period at all Department of Health designated liver 
transplant centres in England and Wales (n = 207). The cost per QALY model 
comprised net total costs from assessment to 27 months following assessment as 
the numerator of the ratio. Net survival over the same time period, adjusted for 
HR-QOL using population values for the EQ-5D descriptive system, formed the 
denominator.
RESULTS: Priority for liver transplantation differed markedly according to 
whether patients were ranked according to efficiency (net cost per QALY) or 
equity considerations (PSI) and the differences in ranks were found to be 
statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasises that the priorities of the general public may 
not accord with those arising from a pure efficiency objective and quantifies 
the extent of the efficiency loss in terms of lost QALYs and increased net 
programme costs associated with the incorporation of equity concerns as 
reflected in public preferences for the allocation of donor livers for 
transplantation.

Collaboration.

Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England. K.Stevens@Sheffield.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation to 
identify any differences in the expected costs and outcomes between patients 
treated with pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) and those without, in order to 
better inform healthcare decision makers.
METHOD: The evaluation was carried out alongside a clinical trial investigating 
the use of PACs in intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK. It was conducted from 
the perspective of the UK NHS, in which PACs are an established intervention. 
Treating patients without using a PAC was characterised as the new intervention. 
The primary outcome measure was QALYs. The secondary outcome measure was 
hospital mortality. NHS costs per patient were calculated for the financial year 
2002/03. The bootstrap method was used to characterise the uncertainty of the 
results and to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The cost per QALY and per life gained from the withdrawal of PACs were 
Pounds 2892 and Pounds 21,164, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that withdrawal of PACs from 
routine clinical use in ICUs within the NHS would be considered cost effective 
in the current decision-making climate.

Cost-utility of somatropin (rDNA origin) in the treatment of growth hormone 
deficiency in children.

Joshi AV(1), Munro V, Russell MW.

Author information:
(1)Novo Nordisk Inc., Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to generate estimates of 
cost-effectiveness/utility of somatropin (rDNA origin) in the treatment of 
growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model of the epidemiology and treatment of GHD in 
children was developed. Treatment of GHD was assessed in two hypothetical 
cohorts compared to no treatment--treatment with somatropin 0.030 mg/kg/day from 
ages 5 to 16 years, and treatment from ages 3 to 18 years. Costs (stated in 2005 
US$) included those related to drug acquisition, endocrinologist consultations, 
and primary care office visits. Estimates of patient weight by age and sex were 
derived from published literature, as was the proportion of patients achieving 
normal height through somatropin treatment and pre/post-treatment patient 
utilities. Cost-effectiveness/utility was estimated over patients' expected 
lifetimes, and was stated alternatively as discounted (3% per annum) US dollars 
per normal height year (NHY) gained, and cost per quality adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure 
robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of treating children from ages 
5 to 16 years with somatropin was estimated at approximately $8,900 per NHY 
gained and $37,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Corresponding ratios 
pertaining to treatment of children from ages 3 to 18 years were $9,300 per NHY 
gained and $42,600 per QALY gained. Findings were relatively insensitive to 
variation in most model parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: For both age cohorts, the cost-effectiveness/utility of somatropin 
in the treatment of GHD compares favorably to well-accepted threshold values. 
The use of somatropin represents reasonable value for money for the treatment of 
GHD in children.

The Alcohol Expectancy Challenge (EC) is a promising program for changing 
alcohol expectancies and reducing alcohol consumption in "heavy drinking" young 
men in a bar-lab setting. In this study the EC was adapted for use in 
mixed-gender groups in a holiday setting and its feasibility tested in camping 
resorts in the Netherlands where a lot of binge drinking takes place (summer 
2002). Male and female participants (N = 170; mean age, 18.8 years) were 
randomly assigned to an EC or to an assessment-only control group. One day 
before the intervention, alcohol expectancies were measured by a Visual Analogue 
Scale of arousal-sedation expectancies (VAS expectancies questionnaire). At the 
same time, alcohol use in everyday life and on holiday was assessed by a General 
Drinking Questionnaire and a 24-hour drinking diary, respectively. Twenty-four 
hours after the intervention, the VAS expectancies questionnaire was 
administered again and alcohol use over the previous 24 hours was reported in 
the drinking diary. Six weeks after the intervention, participants were 
telephoned and administered oral versions of the VAS expectancies questionnaire 
and General Drinking Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVAs. 
Although the study was hampered by recruitment difficulties, the EC proved 
feasible in this setting, was well received by youngsters, and effects on their 
alcohol expectancies may have been present. No effect was found on alcohol use. 
In conclusion, implementation must be improved and more studies are needed to 
come to more definite conclusions about the value of the EC in a real-life 
targeted intervention.

One fourth of US deaths take place in long-term care facilities. As the 
population ages and hospitals shorten length of stay, these settings will 
deliver more terminal care. Using an illustrative case of an older patient with 
metastatic melanoma whose life expectancy was weeks to months, we discuss when 
potential benefits outweigh the risks of transfer from the hospital to 
post-acute care settings. To improve continuity of care, we outline 
communication of treatment goals and orders that anticipate symptom escalation. 
We discuss criteria physicians can use to identify the settings most able to 
ensure access to high-quality palliative care. Physicians and patients must 
consider the advantages and disadvantages of inpatient hospice, nursing homes, 
and residential care facilities. Post-acute care settings vary in delivery of 
hospice and other palliative care services, professional nursing services, and 
support of activities of daily living. Finally, we discuss the evidence that 
palliative care can be improved in these settings, including innovations in 
advance care planning, staff training, and systematic changes in clinical care 
practices. Expanding, replicating, and disseminating these studies will be 
necessary to improve care for the growing number of persons who die in 
post-acute care settings.

A novel guanylyl cyclase receptor, BdmGC-1, is highly expressed during the 
development of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel).

Republic of China.

A novel receptor guanylyl cyclase (GC) has been identified from the oriental 
fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) and has been designated BdmGC-1. Protein 
domain analysis revealed that BdmGC-1 possesses a characteristic domain 
organization similar to all known receptor GCs but with a unique 
carboxyl-terminal extension. When overexpressed in 293T cells, BdmGC-1 manifests 
as a cell-surface glycoprotein with a marked cGMP-generating activity but is 
unresponsive to all ligands known to activate mammalian receptor GCs. BdmGC-1 
mRNAs were highly expressed during development but had low or no expression in 
adult tissues. On the basis of its unique sequence and distinct developmental 
expression pattern, BdmGC-1 represents a novel receptor GC that may play a 
critical role during the development of B. dorsalis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increasing life expectancy makes cardiac surgery in 
octogenarians not very uncommon. We evaluated the characteristics and outcomes 
of patients aged over 80 undergoing cardiac surgery in our centre.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative risk factors, 
in-hospital morbimortality, and long term survival in 120 patients aged 80 
years--mean age (standard deviation): 81.53 (1.83)--who underwent cardiac 
surgery between 2000 and 2005, in comparison with 2425 younger patients referred 
to our center during the same period.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, octogenarians presented arterial hypertension, renal 
failure, unstable angina, left main coronary stenosis and New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV more frequently than younger 
patients. Combined cardiac surgery procedures (valvular plus coronary) were also 
significatively higher (20% vs. 9.85%). Hospital mortality (15.8%) was twice as 
higher as in the non octogenarian population and postoperative intensive care 
units and hospital stay was longer. 45% suffered some postoperative
