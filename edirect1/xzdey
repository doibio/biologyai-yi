Traditional Mozzarella is a fresh cheese produced in Italian local market 
without additives that shows a short shelf life of about 5 d. This work tested 
the use of natural additives (bergamot juice concentrate-BJ and calcium 
lactate-CL) in preserving liquid for a Mozzarella cheese with the aim to extend 
its shelf life, regarding the microbial growth and overall cheese quality. 
Results of qualitative analyses showed that the preserving liquid with the mix 
of BJ and CL promoted an extension of mozzarella shelf life up to 20 d. A 
slightly reduced growth of Pseudomonas species was evidenced after 5 d of 
storage, whereas no inhibition of lactic acid bacteria was observed for the 
storage period. Moreover, mozzarella cheese packed in mixed preserving liquid 
possessed better textural properties, evidenced by the lowest proteolysis index 
measured after 13 d of storage, and a good antioxidant activity.

Predictions for the upcoming decades suggest an increase in the number of 
elderly people in Europe; due to low fertility and the rise in average life 
expectancy, societies age considerably faster. The nature of these changes 
signifies that a complex demographic process is taking place. In consequence, 
one can notice an increase in the demand for personal and nursing care 
activities provided in the natural human environment, or in various 
institutions, by adequately prepared, specialized medical staff. Creating the 
best possible procedures for assisting elderly people is a multifaceted and 
dynamic problem. The constantly changing expectations regarding healthcare 
providers, and the higher social and health awareness are challenging medical 
sciences and social services to provide the oldest generation with the best 
quality of life. The life satisfaction measure for elderly people is their 
activity which determines an independent, self-reliant, satisfactory, and long 
life. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2021;34(3):339-50.

BACKGROUND: The concept of workability provides a conceptual framework and 
proposes measures for the evaluation of relevant actions focused on a healthy 
workforce. In Spain, one of the countries with the highest life expectancy, 
there are practically no scientific studies on workability and its associated 
factors.
AIMS: The objective of this study is to examine the associations between 
workability and variables related to health and work in a sample of workers from 
Spanish health centres.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 1184 health centre workers who 
completed a questionnaire at baseline, comprising measures of workability, 
health and other work-related factors. Workability has been analysed as a 
one-factor construct, and as a two-factor construct. Multinomial logistic 
regression models were used to analyse factors associated with workability.
RESULTS: As a one-dimensional construct, workability is associated with physical 
and mental health, number of hours of worked, insomnia, work and family life 
balance, adequate training, never having had an accident and type of contract. 
When the two-factor measure was used, sensitivity of findings increased, and it 
was identified that those participants who were older, lived alone and have more 
years of service in their profession also show worse workability.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified factors associated with the 
workability of health centre workers. The two-factor workability index (WAI) has 
better psychometric properties and used in combination with the global measure 
of WAI, identifies important additional aspects, specifically, age and years of 
professional experience as additional considerations for the intervention.

BACKGROUND: This study was conducted in two parts to improve the antimicrobial 
activity and stability of Satureja hortensis essential oil (SEO) and its impacts 
on the quality of pomegranate arils. In the first part, SEO was encapsulated by 
an ionic gelation technique into 142.2-267.7 nm chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs). 
In the second part of the experiment, the CSNPs and CSNPs-SEO were applied to 
improve storability of pomegranate arils. Arils were dipped in water (control), 
CSNPs and CSNPs-SEO for 5 min. After superficial water removal, arils were 
packed into polystyrene boxes and stored at 5 °C for 18 days.
RESULTS: Based on spectrophotometry analysis, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) 
of SEO-loaded CSNPs (CSNPs-SEO) decreased from 26.57% to 7.41% and their loading 
capacity (LC) increased from 4.72% to 6.17%, respectively, upon increasing the 
initial SEO content from 0.125 to 0.5 g g-1 of chitosan. Phytochemicals and 
water content were maintained, and microbial counts were reduced in the coated 
arils during storage. Total phenol and antioxidant activity decreased during 
storage. At the end of storage, the highest total phenol content (2980.0 mg 
gallic acid equivalents L-1 ) was found in arils treated with CSNPs-SEO, whereas 
ascorbic acid content was maximal (6.32 mg L-1 ) in arils treated with CSNPs. 
The encapsulation of savory essential oil in chitosan nanoparticles did not have 
undesirable effects in pomegranate arils.
CONCLUSION: Pre-storage treatment of pomegranate arils with CSNPs-SEO could be 
considered a beneficial treatment to better maintain the biochemical and 
sensorial quality during storage. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Bacteria can organise themselves into communities in the forms of biofilms and 
swarms. Through chemical and physical interactions between cells, these 
communities exhibit emergent properties that individual cells alone do not have. 
While bacterial communities have been mainly studied in the context of 
biochemistry and molecular biology, recent years have seen rapid advancements in 
the biophysical understanding of emergent phenomena through physical 
interactions in biofilms and swarms. Moreover, new technologies to control 
bacterial emergent behaviours by physical means are emerging in synthetic 
biology. Such technologies are particularly promising for developing engineered 
living materials (ELM) and devices and controlling contamination and biofouling. 
In this minireview, we overview recent studies unveiling physical and mechanical 
cues that trigger and affect swarming and biofilm development. In particular, we 
focus on cell shape, motion and density as the key parameters for mechanical 
cell-cell interactions within a community. We then showcase recent studies that 
use physical stimuli for patterning bacterial communities, altering collective 
behaviours and preventing biofilm formation. Finally, we discuss the future 
potential extension of biophysical and bioengineering research on microbial 
communities through computational modelling and deeper investigation of 
mechano-electrophysiological coupling.

Healthcare aims to help older people to live well, but ultimately must also 
support them to die well. Most people die in old age, but predicting death in 
both short- and long-term is impossible for many, although not all, older 
people. Frail older people live with hope and pride in coping, and often 
anticipate recovery when ill. Key objectives of healthcare for older people are 
to maintain independence, minimise suffering and preserve dignity, which 
requires active medical, mental health and rehabilitation management, even when 
extending life is not the main goal. Thorough medical diagnosis and appropriate 
treatment and rehabilitation minimise disability, physical and mental distress 
and problems resulting from acute illness and crises. In these terms, 'health 
gain' can be achieved from medical intervention, even when life expectancy is 
short. Assumptions derived from cancer care about lack of reversibility with 
medical interventions are sometimes unwarranted. This has to be balanced against 
investigation- and treatment-burden, including that associated with hospital 
admission and the adverse effects of drugs and therapy interventions, and the 
need to respect the identity and autonomy of individuals. The resolution of 
these tensions requires anticipation of care options, multi-professional 
assessment, judicious and targeted treatment, good communication with patients 
and stakeholders and rigorous shared decision-making. In this commentary, we 
compare geriatric and palliative medicine, and describe how the geriatric 
medical approach can deliver appropriate healthcare towards the end of life. 
This is well supported by the broad knowledge, skill-set, flexibility and 
professional values displayed by geriatricians working in multi-professional 
teams.

BACKGROUND: Insufficiency fractures of the sacrum are being detected 
increasingly more frequently, whereby their incidence will no doubt increase 
further as a result of the rise in life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: The clinical appearance of sacral insufficiency fractures, the 
treatment approach taking into account the clinical outcomes and the DRG 
proceeds are discussed on the basis of clinical examples.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female patients (average age 78.3 years) with sacral 
insufficiency fractures were admitted for inpatient treatment due to increasing 
disabling pain. Taking into account the clinical symptoms and the recommendation 
of an interdisciplinary case conference, one patient was treated conservatively 
with short-term bed rest, accompanying analgesic medication and pain-adapted 
exercise measures. The second patient underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided 
balloon sacroplasty. Transsacroiliac screw fixation was performed on the third 
patient. Pain was documented over the course on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 
and the degree of independence on the Barthel scale. The fractures were 
classified according to Denis et al. and the classification of the FFP according 
to Rommens and Hofmann. The DRG revenue for the 2020 accounting period was then 
presented for each case.
RESULTS: Patient No. 1: conservative therapy, unilateral Denis 1 fracture zone, 
corresponding to an FFP type IIa, baseline pain 7 score points, at discharge 
4 score points, the Barthel scale increased from 55 to 75 points. After 6 days 
hospitalization, transferred to rehab. The DRG proceeds were € 3817.95. Patient 
No. 2: balloon sacroplasty, bilateral Denis 1-2 fracture zone, corresponding to 
an FFP type IIa, baseline pain 9 score points, at discharge 2 score points, the 
Barthel scale increased from 35 to 95 points. After 4 days hospitalization, 
discharged to outpatient follow-up treatment. The DRG proceeds were € 7409.44. 
Patient No. 3: osteosynthesis, bilateral Denis 1 fracture zone, corresponding to 
an FFP type IIa, baseline pain 7 score points, at discharge 2 score points, the 
Barthel scale increased from 40 to 90 points. After 5 days hospitalization, 
transferred to rehab. The DRG proceeds were € 6714.30.
CONCLUSION: The sacral insufficiency fracture is a strong indicator for the 
presence of manifest osteoporosis. Fracture risk factors are the female sex, 
advanced age, the presence of osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency. 
Conservative therapy is the first step of the treatment cascade; however, in 
patients with persistent, disabling pain and no potential for mobilization, 
sacroplasty or osteosynthesis should be performed at an early stage. In patients 
treated with coordinated therapy processes and without clinical complications, 
all three treatment options are economically sufficient.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Insuffizienzfrakturen des Os sacrum 
werden in letzter Zeit immer häufiger detektiert, wobei aufgrund der steigenden 
Lebenserwartung die Inzidenz weiter zunehmen wird.
ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Beispielhaft werden die Klinik der sakralen 
Insuffizienzfraktur, das therapeutische Vorgehen unter Berücksichtigung des 
klinischen Outcomes und der DRG-Erlöse besprochen.
PATIENTEN UND METHODEN: Drei weibliche Patienten (Ø Alter 78,3 Jahre) mit 
sakralen Insuffizienzfrakturen wurden aufgrund von zunehmenden immobilisierenden 
Schmerzen stationär aufgenommen. Unter Berücksichtigung der Klinik und der 
Empfehlung aus einer interdisziplinären Fallkonferenz wurde eine Patientin 
konservativ mit kurzfristiger Bettruhe, begleitender Schmerzmedikation und 
schmerzadaptierten Bewegungsmaßnahmen behandelt. Bei einer Patientin erfolgte 
eine CT-gesteuerte Ballonsakroplastie. Bei einer Patientin wurde eine 
transiliosakrale Verschraubung durchgeführt. Die Schmerzen wurden im Verlauf 
mittels VAS und die Selbstständigkeit anhand des Barthel-Index dokumentiert. Die 
Frakturen wurden nach Denis et al. und der Klassifikation der „fragility 
fractures of the pelvis“ (FFP) nach Rommens und Hofmann eingeteilt. Anschließend 
erfolgte für jeden Fall eine Darstellung der DRG-Erlöse der Abrechnungsperiode 
2020.
ERGEBNISSE: Patientin Nr. 1: konservative Therapie, einseitige 
Denis-1-Frakturzone, entsprechend einer FFP Typ IIa, Ausgangsschmerz 
7 Score-Punkte, bei Entlassung 4 Score-Punkte; der Barthel-Index stieg von 55 
auf 75 Punkte. Nach 6 stationären Tagen Verlegung in die Reha. Der DRG-Erlös lag 
bei € 3817,95. Patientin Nr. 2: Ballonsakroplastie, beidseitige Denis 1–2 
Frakturzone, entsprechend einer FFP Typ IIa, Ausgangsschmerz 9 Score-Punkte, bei 
Entlassung 2 Score-Punkte, der Barthel-Index stieg von 35 auf 95 Punkte. Nach 4 
stationären Tagen Entlassung in die ambulante Weiterbehandlung. Der DRG-Erlös 
lag bei € 7409,44. Patientin Nr. 3: Osteosynthese, beidseitige 
Denis-1-Frakturzone, entsprechend einer FFP Typ IIa, Ausgangsschmerz 
7 Score-Punkte, bei Entlassung 2 Score-Punkte, der Barthel-Index stieg von 40 
auf 90 Punkte. Nach 5 stationären Tagen Verlegung in die Reha. Der DRG-Erlös lag 
bei € 6714,30.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Die sakrale Insuffizienzfraktur ist ein starker Indikator für 
das Vorliegen einer manifesten Osteoporose. Als Frakturrisikofaktoren finden 
sich das weibliche Geschlecht, das hohe Alter, eine vorhanden Osteoporose und 
ein Vitamin-D-Mangel. Zunächst steht die konservative Therapie im Vordergrund 
der Behandlungskaskade. Bei Patienten mit persistierenden, immobilisierenden 
Schmerzen und keiner Möglichkeit der Mobilisierung sollte jedoch rechtzeitig 
eine Sakroplastie oder Osteosynthese durchgeführt werden. Bei 
komplikationsfreien Verläufen und abgestimmten Therapieprozessen sind alle 3 
Behandlungsansätze wirtschaftlich zu erbringen.

Ravulizumab every 8 weeks showed non-inferiority to eculizumab every 2 weeks in 
a 26-week, phase 3, randomized controlled trial in adults with paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who were clinically stable on eculizumab 
(NCT03056040). We report results from the first 26 weeks of the extension period 
in which patients continued ravulizumab (n = 96) or switched from eculizumab to 
ravulizumab (n = 95). At week 52, mean (SD) lactate dehydrogenase levels 
increased 8.8% (29%) with ravulizumab-ravulizumab and 5.8% (27%) with 
eculizumab-ravulizumab from primary evaluation period baseline. During the 
extension period, four patients (ravulizumab-ravulizumab, n = 3; 
eculizumab-ravulizumab, n = 1) experienced breakthrough hemolysis, but none 
associated with serum free C5 ≥ 0.5 μg/mL. Mean Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scores remained stable through week 52. During 
the extension period, proportions of patients avoiding transfusion remained 
stable (ravulizumab-ravulizumab, 86.5%; eculizumab-ravulizumab, 83.2%); 81.2% 
and 81.1%, respectively, had stabilized hemoglobin. All patients maintained 
serum free C5 levels < 0.5 μg/mL. Adverse events were generally similar between 
groups, and rates were lower in the extension period. Adults with PNH on stable 
eculizumab therapy who received ravulizumab over 52 weeks experienced durable 
efficacy, with consistent efficacy in patients who received eculizumab during 
the primary evaluation period and then switched to ravulizumab. Ravulizumab was 
well tolerated.

A systematic review on durability and structural valve deterioration in TAVR and 
surgical AVR.

Mechanical valves and bioprosthetic heart valves are widely used for aortic 
valve replacement (AVR). Mechanical valves are associated with risk of bleeding 
because of oral anticoagulation, while the durability and structural valve 
deterioration (SVD) represent the main limitation of the bioprosthetic heart 
valves. The implantation of bioprosthetic heart valves is increasing 
precipitously due aging population, and the widespread use of transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR). TAVR has become the standard treatment for 
intermediate or high surgical risk patients and a reasonable alternative to 
surgery for low risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Moreover, 
TAVR is increasingly being used for younger and lower-risk patients with longer 
life expectancy; therefore it is important to ensure the valve durability for 
long-term transcatheter aortic valves. Although the results of mid-term 
durability of the transcatheter heart valves are encouraging, their long-term 
durability remains largely unknown. This review summarises the definitions, 
mechanisms, risk factors and assessment of SVD; overviews available data on 
surgical bioprosthetic and transcatheter heart valves durability.

Decision-making capacity (DMC) in aging adults has become increasingly salient 
as the number of older adults, life expectancy, and the amount of wealth to be 
transferred from older generations have all increased. The accurate and reliable 
determination of older adults' DMC is a particularly important topic given its 
implication in legal, financial, and health decisions. Based upon the 
four-ability DMC model promulgated by Appelbaum and Grisso in the 1980's, a 
number of MacArthur Competence Assessment Tools have been developed and widely 
utilized. However, these tools do not include cognitive testing or other sources 
of objective data and have limited validity in a medico-legal setting, 
necessitating additional options for the evaluation of DMC. This is significant 
from the perspective of the patient because they have a vested interest in 
accurate and objective assessment of their DMC across domains.Given the 
disparities in the assessment of DMC, the authors propose, through this debate 
article, that the evaluation of DMC in the aging adult population utilize a 
combination of traditional interview and domain specific instruments and 
neuropsychological testing. To achieve a consensus on the issue, medical experts 
in a number of fields related to capacity evaluation, including psychiatry, 
neurology, neuropsychology, and general medicine were consulted and recruited as 
authors. Experts in Swiss law and ethics were also consulted and provided 
input.A tendency to focus on a single capacity, and in particular, the ability 
to consent to medical treatment, arose in the literature. Similarly, there are 
many instruments purporting to evaluate a single capacity (e.g., consenting to 
medical treatment, managing finances), while other areas important to the 
evaluation of DMC received little attention (e.g., activities of daily living, 
the ability to live independently, to marry, to resist undue influence, and to 
make a will or advanced care directive). Medical and legal experts in the 
multidisciplinary group agreed that there is a clear need for more consistency 
across evaluation of DMC domains and that a combined approach of traditional 
methods and neuropsychological testing provides a more thorough evaluation and 
better serves the patient.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and its associated diseases have become a major world-wide 
health problem. Purple-leaf Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) (PLT), that is rich of 
anthocyanins, has been shown to have preventive effects on obesity and metabolic 
disorders. The intestinal microbiota has been shown to contribute to 
inflammation, obesity, and several metabolic disorders. However, whether PLT 
consumption could prevent obesity and diet-induced metabolic diseases by 
modulating the gut microbiota, is not clearly understood.
METHODS: In this study, six-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a normal diet 
(ND) or a high fat diet (HFD) without or with PLT for 10 weeks.
RESULTS: PLT modulated the gut microbiota in mice and alleviated the symptoms of 
HFD-induced metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, adipocyte 
hypertrophy, and hepatic steatosis. PLT increased the diversity of the 
microbiota and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. f_Barnesiellaceae, 
g_Barnesiella, f_Ruminococcaceae, and f_Lachnospiraceae were discriminating 
faecal bacterial communities of the PLT mice that differed from the HFD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PLT altered the microbial contents of the 
gut and prevented microbial dysbiosis in the host, and consequently is involved 
in the modulation of susceptibility to insulin resistance, hepatic diseases, and 
obesity that are linked to an HFD.

Smoking tobacco is a major public health issue and a significant cause of 
increased mortality. People with a first episode of psychosis are more likely to 
smoke and the subgroup that goes on to have schizophrenia will have a 
significantly reduced life expectancy to the general population. The City & 
Hackney Early and Quick Intervention in Psychosis Team is a community mental 
health team at East London NHS Foundation Trust, providing outpatient care for 
adults presenting with first episode psychosis. This project aimed to increase 
the number of smoking cessation referrals from EQUIP to national smoking 
cessation services to 15% of the total team caseload over 6 months initially. A 
secondary measure was to complete an assessment of the smoking status for 90% of 
the caseload at all times. Change ideas were tested using plan-do-study-act 
cycles. A smoking cessation referral pathway was created and disseminated to the 
outpatient and inpatient services. The project was discussed at least monthly at 
the clinical team meeting. An education and skills building session was 
organised and took place at the team away day and an education drop-in session 
for patients was organised. The project was slow to take-off and patient 
participation was essential in driving progress. The aim was achieved at 23 
months. A collateral benefit indicated that 25.7% of the total number of smokers 
had been recorded as having stopped smoking during the course of this project. 
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of quality improvement methodology 
facilitated by efficient leadership, collaborative teamwork, patient 
participation and persistence to address a complex problem that has significant 
consequences to patient health.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a diffuse cystic lung disease. There are two 
main types of LAM: sporadic, and LAM associated with the tuberous sclerosis 
complex (TSC), which is caused by mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. LAM is 
characterised by cystic lung disease resulting in progressive dyspnoea, renal 
angiomyolipomas and lymphatic complications. Pneumothorax occurs frequently 
(70%) and definitive management with pleurodesis is recommended as the risk of 
recurrence is high. Characteristic thin-walled cysts are seen on computed 
tomography and the presence of elevated serum levels of a vascular endothelial 
growth factor-D has good diagnostic specificity. Currently, no single clinical 
or serological factor has been shown to predict prognosis. However, over the 
past decade, significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of 
LAM has led to improved recognition of this rare disease and identification of 
treatment options. Mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors slow the rate of 
lung function decline and can resolve chylous effusion and regress 
angiomyolipomas. Life expectancy in patients with LAM is favourable, with a mean 
transplant-free survival >20 years from the time of diagnosis. Continued 
advances in understanding the molecular basis of LAM will lead to improved 
therapeutic targets and the development of more robust prognostic indicators.
EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To illustrate the clinical features, common presentations and 
radiological features of LAMTo outline the diagnostic approach to LAM, including 
the role of VEGF-DTo review the current prognostic indicators in LAM, and 
outline the impact of lung function, hormonal status, VEGF-D and clinical 
presentation on outcomeTo inform clinicians on the management options for LAM 
both pharmacological and nonpharmacological.

This time-series study collects data on stroke-related mortality, years of life 
lost (YLL), air pollution, and meteorological conditions in 96 Chinese cities 
from 2013 to 2016 and proposes a three-stage strategy to generate the national 
and regional estimations of avoidable YLL, gains in life expectancy and 
stroke-related population attributable fraction by postulating that the daily 
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been kept under certain standards. A total 
of 1 318 911 stroke deaths are analyzed. Each 10 µg m-3 increment in PM2.5 at 
lag03 is associated with a city-mean increase of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.44) years 
of life lost from stroke. A number of 914.11 (95% CI: 538.28, 1288.94) years of 
city-mean life lost from stoke could be avoided by attaining the WHO's Air 
Quality Guidelines (AQG) (25 µg m-3). Moreover, by applying the AQG standard, 
0.11 (0.08, 0.15) years of life lost might be prevented for each death, and 
about 0.91% (95% CI: 0.62%, 1.19%) of the total years of life lost from stroke 
might be explained by the daily excess PM2.5 exposure. This study indicates that 
stroke patients can have a longer life expectancy if stricter PM2.5 standards 
are put in place, especially ischemic stroke patients.

Little is known about the evaluative and cognitive foundations for adopting 
preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Recognizing the existence 
of a gap in the knowledge describing the intention and behavior of participating 
in health measures, this study investigated the drivers that contribute to the 
intention to take health protective measures among 305 rural youth from the 
Dashtestan Region, Bushehr Province, and southern Iran, reached through an 
online survey. Protection motivation theory (PMT) served as the theoretical 
framework for the study. It was able to forecast variation in intentions and 
behaviors with accuracies of 39 and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, the 
variables of response efficiency, perceived severity, and self-efficacy had a 
positive and significant effect on protective intentions. Additionally, 
perceived severity, self-efficacy, and intention produced a positive and 
significant impression on behaviors, with most of the behavioral variance being 
accounted for by intention, as was hypothesized. In conclusion, it is suggested 
that health development including training measures that take account of both 
the concrete issues of health resources and technologies and of more abstract 
ones, such as mindset readiness, are important for engagement in positive health 
care behaviors. Accordingly, training-based interventions for rural youth should 
be contemplated, with the object of changing their intentions.

PURPOSE: Radiosurgery and fractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT) are effective treatment modalities for meningiomas and schwannomas. 
Although fractionated IMRT yields favorable tumor control, daily treatments for 
5 to 6 weeks can be burdensome for patients and health care systems. Thus, 
hypofractionated radiation may be a reasonable alternative. The purpose of this 
study was to review the results of patients with benign meningiomas or 
schwannomas treated at our institution with moderately hypofractionated IMRT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: After institutional review board approval, patients 
treated at a single academic institution between 2008 and 2018 with a primary 
diagnosis of either meningioma or schwannoma and who received 30 Gy at 3 Gy per 
fraction were identified. Patient and tumor characteristics, as well as 
follow-up documentation, were reviewed. Tumor progression was determined by 
reviewing patient imaging and provider notations.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2018, 70 patients with either meningioma or schwannoma 
were treated to 30 Gy. The median patient age was 73 years (range, 43-92 years). 
At the median follow up of 3.2 years, the local control was 92.9%. Two patients 
(2.9%) had disease progression, which occurred at 9.6 and 6.6 years after 
treatment. One patient developed asymptomatic radiographic changes consistent 
with radiation necrosis, which resolved without intervention. All patients 
completed the prescribed course without interruption. The mean tumor volume was 
18.9 cm3, median volume was 36.6 cm3 (range, 3.4-245.5 cm3), and tumor volume 
was not associated with recurrence risk. Both tumors with progression were 
schwannomas.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated radiation with 30 Gy at 3 Gy per fraction is an 
effective, convenient, and well-tolerated alternative for patients with benign 
meningiomas or schwannomas. Modest hypofractionation provided durable control 
for a wide range of tumor volumes and should be considered for patients with a 
limited life expectancy or those unable to receive a more extended fractionated 
radiation therapy course.

Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease affecting the lungs 
pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Pulmonary complications are the most common 
manifestation of the disease. Recent advances in the treatment of pulmonary 
complications have resulted in substantial improvement in life expectancy. Less 
than 10% of persons with CF (PWCF) develop liver disease (CFLD). There is 
conflicting evidence about impact of liver disease on mortality in CF, with 
evidence suggesting that CFLD contributes to increased mortality in CF, while 
other studies suggest that the impact on mortality is limited. Understanding the 
contribution of liver disease to mortality in CF is essential if further 
improvements in life expectancy are to be achieved. Objective: To document the 
impact of liver disease on life expectancy for PWCF. Methods: This systematic 
review will be conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P 2015). PubMed, Medline 
and Embase will be searched for English language publications (1949-2020). 
Studies reporting the outcome for CFLD will be included where the definition of 
CFLD is outlined clearly in a CF population. Studies with and without a 
comparator will be evaluated. Clinical trials of ursodeoxycholic acid will be 
excluded as well as organ transplantation outcome studies. We will examine 
all-cause and specific causes of mortality.We will include transplantation in 
our estimates of all-cause mortality. The Axis Risk of Bias Tool for 
Observational Studies will be used to evaluate the quality of studies. We will 
provide a narrative synthesis of our findings using tabular formats to highlight 
any impact of liver disease on mortality in CF. Conclusion: It is anticipated 
that this review will bring clarity to the question of whether CFLD shortens 
life expectancy in PWCF and stimulate new approaches to the management of CFLD.

Racism is a public health crisis. Black communities (including Africans, the 
African diaspora and people of African descent) experience worse health outcomes 
as demonstrated by almost any measure of health and wellbeing-e.g. life 
expectancy; disease prevalence; maternal mortality rates. While health promotion 
has its foundation in promoting equity and social justice, it is clear that 
however well-intended, we are not affecting meaningful change for Black 
communities quickly enough. Through this article, we outline the intersection of 
social determinants of health and anti-Black racism. We describe how in the 
first 8 months of 2020 Black communities around the globe have been 
disproportionately affected by COVID-19, while also having to respond to new 
instances of police brutality. We assert that the time has come for health 
promotion to stop neutralizing the specific needs of Black communities into 
unspoken 'good intentions'. Instead, we offer some concrete ways for the field 
to become outspoken, intentional and honest in acknowledging what it will take 
to radically shift how we promote health and wellbeing for Black people.

As life expectancy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
(PLWHIV) increases, management models for HIV infection are changing. To 
understand approaches to practice within this shifting climate and across 
different medical settings, in 2017 we conducted a baseline survey among the 
main medical practitioner groups responsible for HIV-infection care in 
Australia: hospital-based physicians (HBP), sexual health physicians (SHP) and 
'accredited general practitioners' (referred to in 2017 study as 's100 GPs'), 
who are GPs authorised to prescribe HIV therapies after completing accredited 
national training. The follow-up survey presented here explores any changes in 
approaches, attitudes and challenges associated with HIV-infection management
