Over the past 100 years, life expectancy has increased dramatically in nearly 
all nations. Yet, these extra years of life gained have not all been healthy, 
particularly for older people aged 60 years and over. In 2020, the World Health 
Organisation (WHO) and United Nations (UN) member states embraced a sweeping 
10-year global plan of action to ensure all older people can live long and 
healthy lives, formally known as the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021-2030). 
With the adoption of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing resolution, countries are 
committed to implementing collaborative actions to improve the lives of older 
people, their families and the communities in which they reside. The Decade 
addresses four interconnected areas of action. Adopting the UN's resolution on 
the Decade of Healthy Ageing has caused excitement, but a question that has 
weighed on everyone's mind is how governments will be held accountable? Besides, 
there have been no goals or targets set for the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing from 
a programmatic perspective for the action areas, and guidance on measures, data 
collection, analysis and reporting are urgently needed to support global, 
regional and national monitoring of the national strategies, programmes and 
policies. To this end, WHO in collaboration with UN agencies and international 
agencies established a Technical Advisory Group for Measurement of Healthy 
Ageing (TAG4MHA) to provide advice on the measurement, monitoring and evaluation 
of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing at the global, regional and national levels.

Mining provides resources for people but can pose risks to ecosystems that 
support cultural keystone species. Our synthesis reviews relevant aspects of 
mining operations, describes the ecology of salmonid-bearing watersheds in 
northwestern North America, and compiles the impacts of metal and coal 
extraction on salmonids and their habitat. We conservatively estimate that this 
region encompasses nearly 4000 past producing mines, with present-day operations 
ranging from small placer sites to massive open-pit projects that annually mine 
more than 118 million metric tons of earth. Despite impact assessments that are 
intended to evaluate risk and inform mitigation, mines continue to harm 
salmonid-bearing watersheds via pathways such as toxic contaminants, stream 
channel burial, and flow regime alteration. To better maintain watershed 
processes that benefit salmonids, we highlight key windows during the mining 
governance life cycle for science to guide policy by more accurately accounting 
for stressor complexity, cumulative effects, and future environmental change.

AIM: The global burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is set to increase by 60% by 
2030. An aging population and increasing treatment complexity add difficulties 
for patients and clinicians in CRC management. Patient preferences can be 
investigated using attribute-based stated preference (AbSP) techniques to 
explore trade-offs between different treatments. These techniques include 
discrete-choice experiments (DCEs), conjoint analysis and time-trade off (TTO) 
methods. This systematic review with a narrative synthesis aimed to determine 
the use and design of AbSP studies in CRC treatment and to identify patient 
choice themes.
METHODS: The searches were performed using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and 
Cochrane Library in March 2021. All manuscripts featuring the use of AbSP 
techniques in CRC treatment were included. Data synthesis was performed using a 
narrative approach.
RESULTS: The search strategy returned 271 articles. Eighteen AbSP studies were 
included featuring 1890 patients and 296 clinicians. AbSP techniques compromised 
DCE (38.9%, n = 7), TTO (38.9%, n = 7) and conjoint analysis (22.2%, n = 4). 
Eleven studies (61.1%) involved piloting of tasks and the average task 
completion rate was 75%. CRC treatments included chemotherapy (33%, n = 6), 
combined treatments (33%, n = 6), surgery (17%, n = 3), targeted therapy (11%, 
n = 2) and radiotherapy (6%, n = 1). The most examined domain was physical 
health, investigated with 49 (59.8%) attributes.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy was the main attribute in chemotherapy treatment. 
With surgery, patients were willing to trade life-expectancy to avoid adverse 
outcomes or a permanent stoma. Communication skills, treatment cost, and 
clinicians' views were important attributes for patients in cancer services. 
Further research in the elderly population, and other quality of life domains, 
are needed to deliver patient-centred CRC care.

BACKGROUND: Endocarditis is a potentially life-threatening infectious disease 
associated with significant morbidity and mortality and an escalating incidence 
in recent decades. In this study, as a part of the global burden of disease 
(GBD) 2019 study, we intend to report endocarditis burden in Iran at national 
and provincial levels from 1990 to 2019.
METHOD: This study was conducted using GBD 2019 study data on endocarditis from 
1990 to 2019. We gathered incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), and mortality rates in Iran and its 31 provinces by sex and age groups 
as epidemiological indices for endocarditis burden. Further decomposition 
analysis was also performed to delineate the endocarditis new cases trend.
RESULTS: On the country scale, age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), 
age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), 
and age-standardized DALYs rate were (16.5 (95% uncertainty interval 13.7 to 
19.8), 3.4 (2.9 to 4.1), 0.6 (0.5 to 0.9), and 14.4 (12.0 to 21.1) in 2019, 
respectively. Decomposition analysis showed that only 59.2% of the overall new 
cases increase (114.1%) was caused by the incidence rate change. All estimated 
age-standardized rates were higher in men in 1990 and 2019 with a ratio of 
1.1-1.5.
CONCLUSION: The ASIR and ASPR of endocarditis increased, and the ASMR and 
age-standardized DALYs rate declined over the past 30 years in Iran, nearly all 
the provinces followed the same pattern with North Khorasan having the Highest 
ASIR, ASPR, ASMR, and DALYs rates in both years. High systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) had the greatest attributed burden among risk factors.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of offering once-off 
birth cohort testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) to people in Ireland born 
between 1965 and 1985, the cohort with the highest reported prevalence of 
undiagnosed chronic HCV infection.
METHODS: Systematic and opportunistic HCV birth cohort testing programs, 
implemented over a 4-year timeframe, were compared with the current practice of 
population risk-based testing only in a closed-cohort decision tree and Markov 
model hybrid over a lifetime time horizon. Outcomes were expressed in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were presented from the health 
system's perspective in 2020 euro (€). Uncertainty was assessed via 
deterministic, probabilistic, scenario, and threshold analyses.
RESULTS: In the base case, systematic testing yielded the largest cost and 
health benefits, followed by opportunistic testing and risk-based testing. 
Compared with risk-based testing, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
opportunistic testing was €14 586 (95% confidence interval €4185-€33 527) per 
QALY gained. Compared with opportunistic testing, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for systematic testing was €16 827 (95% confidence 
interval €5106-€38 843) per QALY gained. These findings were robust across a 
range of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Both systematic and opportunistic birth cohort testing would be 
considered an efficient use of resources, but systematic testing was the optimal 
strategy at willingness-to-pay threshold values typically used in Ireland. 
Although cost-effective, any decision to introduce birth cohort testing for HCV 
(in Ireland or elsewhere) must be balanced with considerations regarding the 
feasibility and budget impact of implementing a national testing program given 
high initial costs and resource use.

Diabetes mellitus, a complex and heterogeneous disease associated with 
hyperglycemia, is a leading cause of mortality and reduces life expectancy. 
Vanadium complexes have been studied for the treatment of diabetes. The effect 
of complex [VO(bpy)(mal)]·H2O (complex A) was evaluated in a human 
hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line and in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
male Wistar rats conditioned in seven groups with different treatments (n = 10 
animals per group). Electron paramagnetic resonance and 51V NMR analyses of 
complex A in high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) revealed the 
oxidation and hydrolysis of the oxidovanadium(IV) complex over a period of 24 h 
at 37 °C to give low-nuclearity vanadates "V1" (H2VO4-), "V2" (H2V2O72-), and 
"V4" (V4O124-). In HepG2 cells, complex A exhibited low cytotoxic effects at 
concentrations 2.5 to 7.5 μmol L-1 (IC50 10.53 μmol L-1) and increased glucose 
uptake (2-NBDG) up to 93%, an effect similar to insulin. In STZ-induced diabetic 
rats, complex A at 10 and 30 mg kg-1 administered by oral gavage for 12 days did 
not affect the animals, suggesting low toxicity or metabolic impairment during 
the experimental period. Compared to insulin treatment alone, complex A 
(30 mg kg-1) in association with insulin was found to improve glycemia 
(30.6 ± 6.3 mmol L-1 vs. 21.1 ± 8.6 mmol L-1, respectively; p = 0.002), 
resulting in approximately 30% additional reduction in glycemia. The 
insulin-enhancing effect of complex A was associated with low toxicity and was 
achieved via oral administration, suggesting the potential of complex A as a 
promising candidate for the adjuvant treatment of diabetes.

BACKGROUND: There are prominent geographic disparities in the life expectancy 
(LE) of older US adults between the states with the highest (leading states) and 
lowest (lagging states) LE and their causes remain poorly understood. Heart 
failure (HF) has been proposed as a major contributor to these disparities. This 
study aims to investigate geographic disparities in HF outcomes between the 
leading and lagging states.
METHODS: The study was a secondary data analysis of HF outcomes in older US 
adults aged 65+, using Center for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored 
Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) database and a 
nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries over 2000-2017. 
Empiric estimates of death certificate-based mortality from HF as underlying 
cause of death (CBM-UCD)/multiple cause of death (CBM-MCD); HF incidence-based 
mortality (IBM); HF incidence, prevalence, and survival were compared between 
the leading and lagging states. Cox regression was used to investigate the 
effect of residence in the lagging states on HF incidence and survival.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2017, HF mortality rates (per 100,000) were higher in 
the lagging states (CBM-UCD: 188.5-248.6; CBM-MCD: 749.4-965.9; IBM: 
2656.0-2978.4) than that in the leading states (CBM-UCD: 79.4-95.6; CBM-MCD: 
441.4-574.1; IBM: 1839.5-2138.1). Compared to their leading counterparts, 
lagging states had higher HF incidence (2.9-3.9% vs. 2.2-2.9%), prevalence 
(15.6-17.2% vs. 11.3-13.0%), and pre-existing prevalence at age 65 (5.3-7.3% vs. 
2.8-4.1%). The most recent rates of one- (77.1% vs. 80.4%), three- (59.0% vs. 
60.7%) and five-year (45.8% vs. 49.8%) survival were lower in the lagging 
states. A greater risk of HF incidence (Adjusted Hazards Ratio, AHR [95%CI]: 
1.29 [1.29-1.30]) and death after HF diagnosis (AHR: 1.12 [1.11-1.13]) was 
observed for populations in the lagging states. The study also observed recent 
increases in CBMs and HF incidence, and declines in HF prevalence, prevalence at 
age 65 and survival with a decade-long plateau stage in IBM in both leading and 
lagging states.
CONCLUSION: There are substantial geographic disparities in HF mortality, 
incidence, prevalence, and survival across the U.S.: HF incidence, prevalence at 
age 65 (age of Medicare enrollment), and survival of patients with HF 
contributed most to these disparities. The geographic disparities and the recent 
increase in incidence and decline in survival underscore the importance of HF 
prevention strategies.

INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Disease progression in myotonic dystrophy (DM) is marked by 
milestone events when functional thresholds are crossed. DM type 2 (DM2) is 
considered less severe than DM type 1 (DM1), but it is unknown whether this 
applies uniformly to all features. We compared the age-dependent risk for 
milestone events in DM1 and DM2 and tested for associations with age of onset 
and sex.
METHODS: We studied a large cohort of adult participants in a national registry 
of DM1 and DM2. Using annual surveys from participants, we ascertained milestone 
events for motor involvement (use of cane, walker, ankle brace, wheelchair, or 
ventilatory device), systemic involvement (diabetes, pacemaker, cancer), loss of 
employment due to DM, and death.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up of registry participants (929 DM1 and 222 DM2 patients) 
was 7 years. Disability and motor milestones occurred at earlier ages in DM1 
than in DM2. In contrast, the risk of diabetes was higher and tended to occur 
earlier in DM2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; P ≤ .001). In DM1, the milestone events 
tended to occur earlier, and life expectancy was reduced, when symptoms began at 
younger ages. In DM1, men were at greater risk for disability (HR, 1.34; 
P ≤ .01), use of ankle braces (HR, 1.41; P = .02), and diabetes (HR, 2.2; 
P ≤ .0001), whereas women were at greater risk for needing walkers (HR, 0.68; 
P = .001) or malignancy (HR, 0.66; P ≤ .01).
DISCUSSION: Milestone events recorded through registries can be used to assess 
long-term impact of DM in large cohorts. Except for diabetes, the age-related 
risk of milestone events is greater in DM1 than in DM2.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes a substantial 
and ongoing burden on the US healthcare system and society. Molnupiravir is a 
new oral antiviral for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings. This study 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness profile of molnupiravir versus best supportive 
care in the treatment of adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at risk 
of progression to severe disease, from a US payer's perspective.
METHODS: The model was developed using a decision tree for the short-term acute 
phase of COVID-19 and a Markov state transition model for the long-term 
post-acute phase. This model compared molnupiravir with best supportive care as 
consistent with the MOVe-OUT trial. Costs were reported in 2021 US dollars. 
Transition probabilities were derived from the phase III MOVe-OUT trial and the 
TriNetX real-world electronic health records database. Costs were derived from 
the TriNetX database and utility values from a de novo, vignette-based utility 
study. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA/PSA) were 
conducted. Primary outcomes included proportion hospitalized, proportion who 
died overall and by highest healthcare setting at the end of the acute phase, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY gained over 
a lifetime (100 years) horizon, discounted at 3% annually and assessed at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: In this model, the use of molnupiravir led to an increase in QALYs 
(0.210) and decrease in direct total medical costs (-$895) per patient across a 
lifetime horizon, compared with best supportive care in COVID-19 outpatients. 
Molnupiravir was the dominant intervention when compared with best supportive 
care. Patients treated with molnupiravir were less likely to be hospitalized 
(6.38% vs. 9.20%) and more likely to remain alive (99.88% vs. 98.71%) during the 
acute phase. Through DSA, molnupiravir treatment effect of hospitalization 
reduction was identified to be the most influential parameter, and through PSA, 
molnupiravir remained dominant in 84% of the total simulations and, overall, 
100% cost effective.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that molnupiravir is cost effective compared 
with best supportive care for the treatment of adult outpatients with COVID-19. 
However, our study was limited by the unavailability of the most recent 
information on the rapidly evolving pandemic, including new viral variants, 
patient populations affected, and changes in standards of care. Further research 
should explore the impact of vaccination on the cost effectiveness of 
molnupiravir and other therapies, based on real-world data, to account for these 
changes, including the impact of vaccination and immunity.

PURPOSE: Current treatment of acromegaly restores a normal life expectancy in 
most cases. So, the study of persistent complications affecting patients' 
quality of life (QoL) is of paramount importance, especially motor disability 
and depression. In a large cohort of acromegalic patients we aimed at 
establishing the prevalence of depression, to look for clinical and 
sociodemographic factors associated with it, and to investigate the respective 
roles (and interactions) of depression and arthropathy in influencing QoL.
METHODS: One hundred and seventy-one acromegalic patients (95 women and 76 men, 
aged 20-85 years) among those recruited in a cross-sectional Italian 
multicentric study were investigated. Each patient filled in three validated 
questionnaires: AcroQoL, WOMAC (measuring articular pain, stiffness and 
functionality), and AIMS (evaluating articular symptoms and depression).
RESULTS: A very high (up to 28%) depression rate was detected in acromegalic 
subjects. Two patients showing pathological AIMS depression scores, committed 
suicide during the three years observational period. In our population poor 
psychological status was significantly associated with female sex. Furthermore, 
a significant strong correlation was found between AIMS depression score and 
WOMAC score. Both depression and arthropathy-related motor disability turned out 
to independently contribute with similar strength to the impairment of QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of depression in acromegaly, which is 
associated with female sex and arthropathy. Both depression and arthropathy 
strongly and independently contribute to the impaired QoL of patients. Our study 
shows that assessment and monitoring of psychological status is mandatory in 
acromegaly, also suggesting an inexpensive tool for this assessment.

The topic of air pollution and its effect on public health has become a hot 
policy issue that has attracted worldwide attention, but this attention has 
seldom been extended to the causal relationship between atmospheric 
environmental policy (AEP), air pollution, and public health. This paper uses 
panel data from 30 provinces in China to construct spatial econometric models 
that analyze the impact of AEP on air pollution, the impact of air pollution on 
public health, and the mediation effect that air pollution may have between AEP 
and public health. The results demonstrate that there is a significant positive 
spatial spillover effect of soot and dust (SD) emission intensity and the 
overall air pollution level as measured by the Air Pollution Index (API). The 
AEP has significant inhibitory effects on the intensity of sulfur dioxide and SD 
emissions, as well as on overall air pollution. An increase in the overall air 
pollution level has a significant detrimental effect on public health as 
measured by average life expectancy. Air pollution as measured by API is a 
mediating factor in the relationship between AEP and public health. The study 
results could help to effectively control air pollution and promote public 
health by leading to improvements in regional pollution prevention and control 
mechanisms and strengthening of the central government's policy formulation and 
local governments' policy implementation process.

BACKGROUND: Geographical differences in health outcomes are reported in many 
countries. Norway has led an active policy aiming for regional balance since the 
1970s. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, we 
examined regional differences in development and current state of health across 
Norwegian counties.
METHODS: Data for life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), years of life 
lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) in Norway and its 11 counties from 1990 to 2019 were 
extracted from GBD 2019. County-specific contributors to changes in life 
expectancy were compared. Inequality in disease burden was examined by use of 
the Gini coefficient.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy and HALE improved in all Norwegian counties from 1990 
to 2019. Improvements in life expectancy and HALE were greatest in the two 
counties with the lowest values in 1990: Oslo, in which life expectancy and HALE 
increased from 71·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·4-72·4) and 63·0 years 
(60·5-65·4) in 1990 to 81·3 years (80·0-82·7) and 70·6 years (67·4-73·6) in 
2019, respectively; and Troms og Finnmark, in which life expectancy and HALE 
increased from 71·9 years (71·5-72·4) and 63·5 years (60·9-65·6) in 1990 to 80·3 
years (79·4-81·2) and 70·0 years (66·8-72·2) in 2019, respectively. Increased 
life expectancy was mainly due to reductions in cardiovascular disease, 
neoplasms, and respiratory infections. No significant differences between the 
national YLD or DALY rates and the corresponding age-standardised rates were 
reported in any of the counties in 2019; however, Troms og Finnmark had a higher 
age-standardised YLL rate than the national rate (8394 per 100 000 [95% UI 
7801-8944] vs 7536 per 100 000 [7391-7691]). Low inequality between counties was 
shown for life expectancy, HALE, all level-1 causes of DALYs, and exposure to 
level-1 risk factors.
INTERPRETATION: Over the past 30 years, Norway has reduced inequality in disease 
burden between counties. However, inequalities still exist at a within-county 
level and along other sociodemographic gradients. Because of insufficient 
Norwegian primary data, there remains substantial uncertainty associated with 
regional estimates for non-fatal disease burden and exposure to risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Globally, transport and unintentional injuries persist as leading 
preventable causes of mortality and morbidity for adolescents. We sought to 
report comprehensive trends in injury-related mortality and morbidity for 
adolescents aged 10-24 years during the past three decades.
METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2019 
Study, we analysed mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
attributed to transport and unintentional injuries for adolescents in 204 
countries. Burden is reported in absolute numbers and age-standardised rates per 
100 000 population by sex, age group (10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years), and 
sociodemographic index (SDI) with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We report 
percentage changes in deaths and DALYs between 1990 and 2019.
FINDINGS: In 2019, 369 061 deaths (of which 214 337 [58%] were transport 
related) and 31·1 million DALYs (of which 16·2 million [52%] were transport 
related) among adolescents aged 10-24 years were caused by transport and 
unintentional injuries combined. If compared with other causes, transport and 
unintentional injuries combined accounted for 25% of deaths and 14% of DALYs in 
2019, and showed little improvement from 1990 when such injuries accounted for 
26% of adolescent deaths and 17% of adolescent DALYs. Throughout adolescence, 
transport and unintentional injury fatality rates increased by age group. The 
unintentional injury burden was higher among males than females for all injury 
types, except for injuries related to fire, heat, and hot substances, or to 
adverse effects of medical treatment. From 1990 to 2019, global mortality rates 
declined by 34·4% (from 17·5 to 11·5 per 100 000) for transport injuries, and by 
47·7% (from 15·9 to 8·3 per 100 000) for unintentional injuries. However, in 
low-SDI nations the absolute number of deaths increased (by 80·5% to 42 774 for 
transport injuries and by 39·4% to 31 961 for unintentional injuries). In the 
high-SDI quintile in 2010-19, the rate per 100 000 of transport injury DALYs was 
reduced by 16·7%, from 838 in 2010 to 699 in 2019. This was a substantially 
slower pace of reduction compared with the 48·5% reduction between 1990 and 
2010, from 1626 per 100 000 in 1990 to 838 per 100 000 in 2010. Between 2010 and 
2019, the rate of unintentional injury DALYs per 100 000 also remained largely 
unchanged in high-SDI countries (555 in 2010 vs 554 in 2019; 0·2% reduction). 
The number and rate of adolescent deaths and DALYs owing to environmental heat 
and cold exposure increased for the high-SDI quintile during 2010-19.
INTERPRETATION: As other causes of mortality are addressed, inadequate progress 
in reducing transport and unintentional injury mortality as a proportion of 
adolescent deaths becomes apparent. The relative shift in the burden of injury 
from high-SDI countries to low and low-middle-SDI countries necessitates focused 
action, including global donor, government, and industry investment in injury 
prevention. The persisting burden of DALYs related to transport and 
unintentional injuries indicates a need to prioritise innovative measures for 
the primary prevention of adolescent injury.
