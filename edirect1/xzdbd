OBJECTIVES: Estimating 1-year life expectancy is an essential factor when 
evaluating appropriate indicators for transcatheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR).
BACKGROUND: It is clinically useful in developing a reliable risk model for 
predicting 1-year mortality after TAVR.
METHODS: We evaluated 2,588 patients who underwent TAVR using data from the 
Optimized CathEter vAlvular iNtervention (OCEAN) Japanese multicenter registry 
from October 2013 to May 2017. The 1-year clinical follow-up was achieved by 
99.5% of the entire population (n = 2,575). Patients were randomly divided into 
two cohorts: the derivation cohort (n = 1,931, 75% of the study population) and 
the validation cohort (n = 644). Considerable clinical variables including 
individual patient's comorbidities and frailty markers were used for predicting 
1-year mortality following TAVR.
RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, a multivariate logistic regression analysis 
demonstrated that sex, body mass index, Clinical Frailty Scale, atrial 
fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, prior cardiac surgery, serum albumin, 
renal function as estimated glomerular filtration rate, and presence of 
pulmonary disease were independent predictors of 1-year mortality after TAVR. 
Using these variables, a risk prediction model was constructed to estimate the 
1-year risk of mortality after TAVR. In the validation cohort, the risk 
prediction model revealed high discrimination ability and acceptable calibration 
with area under the curve of 0.763 (95% confidence interval, 0.728-0.795, 
p < .001) in the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis and a 
Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 statistic of 5.96 (p = .65).
CONCLUSIONS: This risk prediction model for 1-year mortality may be a reliable 
tool for risk stratification and identification of adequate candidates in 
patients undergoing TAVR.

and Genetics, Aarhus University , DK-8000 Aarhus C Denmark.

INTRODUCTION: A poor pharmacokinetic profile due to inadequate distribution and 
rapid renal clearance limits site-specific target engagement and drug efficacy. 
The inherent properties of human serum albumin for broad tissue distribution, 
prolonged circulation, and ligand transport have been engineered into 
albumin-based drug designs to modulate the pharmacokinetics to increase efficacy 
and reduce the frequency of dose.
AREAS COVERED: This review highlights albumin structural features, ligand 
binding, and molecular interactions key to albumin-drug designs and an overview 
of the repertoire of albumin-drugs and approaches, with focus on 
pharmacokinetics of marketed products and clinical trials.
EXPERT OPINION: Comparison, and advantages as well as disadvantages of the 
endogenous albumin-binding versus recombinant albumin construct approach, and 
half-life extension and intracellular drug delivery applications. The section 
addresses current challenges and solutions to the different drug designs, and 
considerations needed to progress the field such as conjugation chemistries, 
drug loading, and animal models. The section highlights the need for a paradigm 
shift in the field from 'utilizing' to 'controlling' albumin transport with 
recombinant human albumin variants engineered for tuned affinity to albumin 
cellular receptors.

BACKGROUND: Rising numbers of patients on the liver transplant waiting list has 
led to the utilization of organs from higher-risk donors that are more likely to 
be discarded and are prone to post-transplant complications. Storage and 
transportation of these livers at low temperatures can cause damage. OrganOx 
metra is a portable device intended to preserve and maintain the donated liver 
in normothermic conditions for up to 24 h prior to transplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of normothermic machine perfusion with 
OrganOx metra in liver transplantation compared to the current practice of 
static cold storage (SCS).
METHODS: A de novo decision analytic model (a decision tree along with a Markov 
model), based on current treatment pathways, was developed to estimate the costs 
and outcomes. Results from a randomized clinical trial and national standard 
sources were used to inform the model. Costs were estimated from the National 
Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore uncertainty 
surrounding input parameters.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, liver transplantation with OrganOx metra 
was more costly and more effective than the current practice of static cold 
storage. The total costs per patient were £37,370 vs £46,711, and the total 
effectiveness per patient was 9.09 QALYs vs 10.27 QALYs for SCS and OrganOx 
metra groups, respectively. The estimated ICER was £7,876 per each QALY gained. 
Results from the PSA showed that use of OrganOx metra has 99% probability of 
being cost-effective at a £20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. OrganOx metra 
led to the utilization of 54 additional livers with patients experiencing lower 
rates of early allograft dysfunction and adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of OrganOx metra for the perfusion and transportation of livers 
prior to transplantation is a cost-effective strategy. KEY POINTS FOR DECISION 
MAKERS Introduction of OrganOx metra into NHS could increase the utilisation of 
donated livers with patients experiencing lower rates of early allograft 
dysfunction and adverse events, compared with current practice. Results of the 
economic analysis indicate that the OrganOx metra is highly likely to be 
cost-effective and result in improved patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of the Florida Sleeve (FS) procedure in patients with 
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) have not been reported before. We compared outcomes 
of the FS procedure between patients with BAV and those with tricuspid aortic 
valve (TAV).
METHODS: From May 1, 2002 to January 1, 2016, 177 patients including 18 BAV and 
159 TAV underwent the FS procedure. Baseline characteristics, perioperative 
outcomes, and echocardiographic measurements were compared between the 2 groups. 
Kaplan-Meier and life-table analyses were used to evaluate survival and freedom 
from reintervention rates.
RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation age and aortic root diameter were comparable 
in BAV and TAV groups, 47.83 ± 11.19 versus 49.59 ± 15.79 years (P = 0.55) and 
56.57 ± 6.18 versus 55.17 ± 8.84 mm (P = 0.46), respectively. The 30-day 
mortality and stroke rates were zero in the BAV group and 1.88% (n = 3) in the 
TAV group (P = 1.00). One patient (5.55%) in the BAV group and 8 (5.03%) 
patients in the TAV group needed permanent pacemaker implantation (P = 0.62). 
Freedom from reoperation was 93% in the BAV group and 99% in the TAV group at 8 
years (P = 0.041). Patient survival rate was 100% in the BAV group and 91% in 
the TAV group at 8 years (P = 0.42). Freedom from aortic insufficiency greater 
than mild was 93% in the BAV group and 96.5% in the TAV group at 5 years (P = 
0.61).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting outcomes of the FS procedure in 
patients with BAV. This technique is feasible, and the results appear to be 
durable when compared to patients with TAV.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness (CE) and budget impact (BI) of 
introducing a patient visit support system (ACT Pack) along with standard of 
care (SoC), in glaucoma treatment in Japan.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to estimate the CE and BI of introducing 
the support system from Japanese payer and governmental perspective, 
respectively. Inputted data for CE and BI analysis were referred from published 
literature and based on medical specialists' inputs. Base case scenario for CE 
considered the support system cost of 30,000 yen per patient per year and a time 
horizon of 45 years. BI analysis compared the financial impact due to 
introduction of support system with SoC compared to SoC alone scenario on 
Japanese healthcare system with a time horizon of 20 years.
RESULTS: The base case of CE analysis showed the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with the support system was 
3,241,729 yen/QALY (29,470 USD/QALY). The sensitivity analysis showed that the 
probability of this support system being cost-effective at a threshold of 5 
million yen/QALY (45,455 USD/QALY) was 53.26%. Blindness reduction after 
introduction of this support system was 8.68%. The BI analysis showed that the 
introduction of support system will lead to a cumulative cost savings of 1,132 
billion yen (10 billion US dollars) for Japanese healthcare system over 20 years 
of time horizon.
LIMITATION: Due to paucity of similar comparative studies, some assumptions were 
made based on medical specialists' inputs. Death status was not considered in 
the analysis.
CONCLUSION: Introduction of this support system with SoC is cost-effective and 
will lead to blindness reduction in Japanese patients with glaucoma. Over a 
20 year period, it will lead to an overall cost savings of 1,132 billion yen (10 
billion US dollars) for the Japanese healthcare system.

Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United 
States (1) and costs associated with it, such as those from losses in workplace 
productivity, health care expenditures, and criminal justice, were $249 billion 
in 2010 (2). CDC used the Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) application* to 
estimate national and state average annual alcohol-attributable deaths and years 
of potential life lost (YPLL) during 2011-2015, including deaths from one's own 
excessive drinking (e.g., liver disease) and from others' drinking (e.g., 
passengers killed in alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes). This study found an 
average of 93,296 alcohol-attributable deaths (255 deaths per day) and 2.7 
million YPLL (29 years of life lost per death, on average) in the United States 
each year. Of all alcohol-attributable deaths, 51,078 (54.7%) were caused by 
chronic conditions, and 52,361 (56.0%) involved adults aged 35-64 years. 
Age-adjusted alcohol-attributable deaths per 100,000 population ranged from 20.3 
in New Jersey and New York to 52.3 in New Mexico. YPLL per 100,000 population 
ranged from 613.8 in New York to 1,651.7 in New Mexico. Implementation of 
effective strategies for preventing excessive drinking, including those 
recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force (e.g., increasing 
alcohol taxes and regulating the number and concentration of alcohol outlets), 
could reduce alcohol-attributable deaths and YPLL.†.

BACKGROUND: Of new HIV infections in the US, 20% occur among young men who have 
sex with men (YMSM, ages 13-24), but >50% of YMSM with HIV are unaware of their 
status. Using Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions 
(ATN) data, we projected the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of frequent 
HIV screening among high-risk YMSM from age 15.
METHODS: Using a mathematical simulation, we examined 3 screening strategies: 
Yearly, 6-monthly, and 3-monthly, each in addition to the Status quo (SQ, 
0.7-10.3% screened/year, stratified by age). We used published data 
(YMSM-specific when available) including: HIV incidences (0.91-6.41/100PY); 
screen acceptance (80%), linkage-to-care/antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation 
(76%), HIV transmission (0.3-86.1/100PY, by HIV RNA), monthly ART costs 
($2290-$3780), and HIV per-screen costs ($38). Projected outcomes included CD4 
count at diagnosis, primary HIV transmissions from ages 15-30, quality-adjusted 
life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, 
$/quality-adjusted life-year saved [QALY]; threshold ≤$100 000/QALY).
RESULTS: Compared to SQ, all strategies increased projected CD4 at diagnosis 
(296 to 477-515 cells/µL) and quality-adjusted life expectancy from age 15 (44.4 
to 48.3-48.7 years) among YMSM acquiring HIV. Compared to SQ, all strategies 
increased discounted lifetime cost for the entire population ($170 800 to $178 
100-$185 000/person). Screening 3-monthly was cost-effective (ICER: $4500/QALY) 
compared to SQ and reduced primary transmissions through age 30 by 40%. Results 
were most sensitive to transmission rates; excluding the impact of 
transmissions, screening Yearly was ≤$100 000/QALY (ICER: $70 900/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: For high-risk YMSM in the US, HIV screening 3-monthly compared to 
less frequent screening will improve clinical outcomes and be cost-effective.

The biopreservative effect of Ephedra alata aqueous extract (EAE), used at 
0.156, 0.312 and 0.624%, on minced beef meat was evaluated by microbiological, 
physicochemical and sensory analyses during storage at 4 °C for 14 days. The 
results showed that EAE significantly (P < .05) delayed the formation of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and carbonyls and reduced the sulfhydryl 
loss in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that EAE had a protective effect 
against lipids and protein oxidation. Concomitantly, an increase of redness and 
loss of lightness and yellowness was observed. Furthermore, two multivariate 
exploratory techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied to all obtained data describing 
the main characteristics attributed to refrigerated meat samples. During storage 
time, the used chemometric approaches were useful in discriminating meat 
samples, and therefore offers an approach to underlay connections between meat 
quality features. The obtained findings demonstrated the strong potential of EAE 
as a natural preservative in meat and meat products.

OBJECTIVES: To elicit a willingness-to-pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) estimate for the general Greek population and assess the impact of 
individuals' socio-demographic characteristics and motives on this estimate.
METHODS: A telephone-based survey was carried out employing a representative 
sample of the general Greek population (n = 1342). A computer-assisted 
telephone-interview method was adopted to ensure random sampling. A total of 528 
participants reported a WTP value for a utility improvement from their current 
health to perfect health. Those individuals' motives were assessed through 
predefined statements. Test-retest reliability was assessed using intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC). Multiple linear regression (MLR) and one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were conducted to assess the effect of 
socioeconomic/demographic determinants and motive statements, respectively, on 
WTP/QALY. MLR was re-estimated considering as dependent variable the WTP/QALY 
estimate calculated for participants: (1) stating a WTP value ≤ their household 
income and (2) presenting higher certainty regarding stated WTP value 
(sensitivity analysis).
RESULTS: Analysis revealed good reliability for WTP/QALY estimates and motive 
statements (ICC values > 0.8). Mean WTP/QALY was €26 280. The respective 5% 
trimmed value was €14 862. Being a student and household income affected 
WTP/QALY. Sensitivity analysis did not produce markedly different WTP/QALY 
predictors, implying the robustness of results, irrespective of the participant 
group considered. Individuals who indicated the inability to cover basic family 
needs or pay tax claims as motives reported lower WTP/QALY values compared with 
those not viewing these aspects as motives.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm that the World Health Organization's criterion 
used currently in Greek cost-effectiveness studies is not unreasonable. 
Additional research is essential to further explore WTP/QALY estimates in the 
Greek setting and facilitate informed decision making.

Nowadays, surgeons have a wide armamentarium of surgical approaches available to 
safely treat sinonasal malignancies, which includes open approaches, with the 
traditional craniofacial resection (CFR), and endoscopic transnasal techniques. 
The correct choice depends on the features of the pathology. It is well known 
that endoscopic approaches have a lower morbidity compared with traditional open 
techniques, due to a shorter hospitalization, absence of facial incisions, and 
avoidance of brain retraction. Moreover, endoscopic surgery presents clear 
technical advantages. For example, magnification of the surgical field allows 
the surgeon to carefully identify tumor margins, the site of origin, and the 
anatomical structures involved by the lesion. Nevertheless, a purely endoscopic 
approach cannot always provide successful resection of the tumor; the patient 
must be informed about the possibility of switching to a combined 
cranioendoscopic resection or CRF, depending on the effective extension of the 
disease evaluated intraoperatively. Despite these advantages, postoperative 
complications can occur after endoscopic endonasal surgery, as in any surgical 
intervention; however, complications after these procedures are less severe and 
less frequent compared with traditional open approaches. The most common 
complications observed include skull base reconstruction failure, intraoperative 
vascular lesions, and orbital or central nervous system complications. Thus, 
endoscopic endonasal resection, when properly planned and performed by 
experienced surgeons, is an acceptable treatment for well-selected skull base 
malignancies with long-term outcomes comparable to those achieved with 
traditional external approaches.

Sinonasal adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare malignancy characterized by an 
insidious growth pattern and a tendency for perineural spread along major and 
minor nerves, resulting in invasion of the skull base and intracranial 
extension. Therefore, many patients present with advanced disease and 
involvement of critical structures, making treatment difficult and potentially 
associated with high morbidity. Surgery represents the mainstay of treatment of 
the primary tumor. Complete resection of the tumor with negative margins, 
whenever feasible, is associated with better survival outcomes. However, in the 
case of extensive involvement of vital structures (e.g., carotid artery, 
cavernous sinus, optic nerve, Meckel's cave) or when radical surgery could 
seriously affect the patient's quality of life, a function-preserving subtotal 
removal of the tumor followed by irradiation can be proposed. The role of 
surgery is limited to a biopsy in unresectable lesions that are more suitable 
for non-surgical treatments (e.g., exclusive chemoradiation). Given the 
difficulty in obtaining negative margins and the propensity for submucosal and 
perineural spread, adjuvant radiotherapy is strongly recommended. Recently, 
heavy-particle radiotherapy using protons or carbon ions has emerged as a 
promising treatment with improved local control. Local failures (60%) and 
distant metastases (40%) are common and can occur even decades after definitive 
treatment. The 5-year overall survival ranges from 55 to 70% and it exceeds that 
of other sinonasal malignancies, but dramatically drops down at 10 years (40%) 
and further decreases at 20 years (15%). Therefore, a prolonged follow-up of at 
least 15 years, and possibly lifelong, is mandatory.

Population extended life expectancy has significantly increased the risk of 
septic shock in an ageing population. Sepsis affects roughly 20 million people 
every year, resulting in over 11 million deaths. The need for faster more 
accurate diagnostics and better management is therefore paramount in the fight 
to prevent these avoidable deaths. Here we report the development of a POC 
device with the ability to identify a broad range of pathogens on a lateral flow 
platform. Namely Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The simple to use 
laboratory device has the potential to be automated, thus enabling an operator 
to carry out solid-phase lysis and room temperature RPA in situ, providing 
accurate results in hours rather than days. Results show there is a potential 
for a fully automated device in which concepts described in this paper can be 
integrated into a lateral flow device.

AIMS: To compare the cost-utility of standard dressing with incisional 
negative-pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) in adults with closed surgical wounds 
associated with major trauma to the lower limbs.
METHODS: A within-trial economic evaluation was conducted from the UK NHS and 
personal social services (PSS) perspective based on data collected from the 
Wound Healing in Surgery for Trauma (WHiST) multicentre randomized clinical 
trial. Health resource utilization was collected over a six-month 
post-randomization period using trial case report forms and 
participant-completed questionnaires. Cost-utility was reported in terms of 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to test the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates 
while uncertainty was handled using confidence ellipses and cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The incremental cost of standard dressing versus iNPWT over six months 
was £2,037 (95% confidence interval (CI) £349 to £3,724). There was an 
insignificant increment in QALYs gained in the iNPWT group (0.005, 95% CI -0.018 
to 0.028). The probability of iNPWT being cost-effective at £20,000 per QALY was 
1.9%. The results remained robust in the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: The within-trial economic evaluation suggests that iNPWT is unlikely 
to be a cost-effective alternative to standard dressing in adults with closed 
surgical wounds to their lower limbs. Cite this article: Bone Joint J

BACKGROUND: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism associated with end-stage renal disease 
is characterized by progression from secondary hyperparathyroidism to an 
autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone that leads to adverse health 
outcomes. Rates of parathyroidectomy (PTX) have decreased with the use of 
calcimimetics. Optimal timing of PTX in relation to kidney transplant remains 
controversial. We aimed to identify the most cost-effective strategy for 
patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism undergoing kidney transplant.
METHODS: We constructed a patient level state transition microsimulation to 
compare 3 management schemes: cinacalcet with kidney transplant, cinacalcet with 
PTX before kidney transplant, or cinacalcet with PTX after kidney transplant. 
Our base case was a 55-year-old on dialysis with tertiary hyperparathyroidism 
awaiting kidney transplant. Outcomes, including quality-adjusted life years, 
surgical complications, and mortality, were extracted from the literature, and 
costs were estimated using Medicare reimbursement data.
RESULTS: Our base case analysis demonstrated that cinacalcet with PTX before 
kidney transplant was dominant, with a lesser cost of $399,287 and greater 
quality-adjusted life years of 10.3 vs $497,813 for cinacalcet with PTX after 
kidney transplant (quality-adjusted life years 9.4) and $643,929 for cinacalcet 
with kidney transplant (quality-adjusted life years 7.4).
CONCLUSION: Cinacalcet alone with kidney transplant is the least cost-effective 
strategy. Patients with end-stage renal disease-related tertiary 
hyperparathyroidism should be referred for PTX, and it is most cost-effective if 
performed prior to kidney transplant.

Nanobodies present an appealing class of potential cancer therapeutics. The 
current study explores the in vivo expression of these molecules through 
DNA-encoded delivery. We hypothesized that this approach could address the rapid 
clearance of Nanobodies and, through half-life modulation, increase the produced 
levels in circulation. We therefore evaluated pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 
variants of an anti-death receptor 5 Nanobody (NbDR5), either monovalent or 
multivalent with half-life extension properties, after DNA-based administration. 
Intramuscular electrotransfer of a monovalent NbDR5-encoding plasmid (pNbDR5) 
did not result in detectable plasma levels in BALB/c mice. A tetravalent 
NbDR5-encoding plasmid (pNbDR54) provided peak concentrations of 54 ng/mL, which 
remained above 24 ng/mL during a 12-week follow-up. DNA-based delivery of these 
Nanobody formats fused to a Nanobody binding to serum albumin (NbSA), 
pNbDR5-NbSA and pNbDR54-NbSA, resulted in significantly higher plasma levels, 
with peak titers of 5.2 and 7.7 µg/mL, respectively. In an athymic-nude mice 
COLO 205 colon-cancer model, a quadrupled intramuscular DNA dose led to peak 
plasma levels of 270 ng/mL for pNbDR54 and 38 µg/mL for pNbDR54-NbSA. Potent 
anti-tumor responses were only observed for pNbDR54, following either 
intramuscular or intratumoral delivery. Despite comparable in vitro activity and 
superior plasma exposure, NbDR54-NbSA was less effective than NbDR54 in vivo, 
regardless of whether delivered as DNA or protein. Overall, DNA-based Nanobody 
delivery resulted in more potent and durable anti-tumor responses than 
protein-based Nanobody delivery. In conclusion, this study demonstrates 
pre-clinical proof of concept for DNA-based Nanobodies in oncology and 
highlights the improved outcome over conventional protein administration.

INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing life expectancy among people living with HIV 
(PLWHIV), anti-retroviral therapy (ART) side effects, HIV chronic inflammation 
and co-morbidities may limit functional abilities and reduced participation in 
exercises and physical activity (PA). PA improves wellbeing and overall quality 
of life of PLWHIV. In Malawi, there is paucity of information regarding PA 
levels among Malawians living with HIV and receiving ART. Therefore, this study 
aimed at determining PA levels among PLWHIV and receiving ART in Malawi.
METHODS: A quantitative cross-sectional design was employed. Eligible 
participants were male and female adults aged 18-45 years living with HIV 
receiving ART for at least 1 year. The participants were recruited from Limbe 
Health Center, Gateway Health Center and Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) 
in Blantyre, Malawi. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) 
was used to assess the PA levels. A Stadiometer (HS-DBS00361, Model: 1127154) 
was used to measure weight (kg) and height (cm) of the participants.
RESULTS: A total of 213 participants were recruited. There were more females 
than male participants (n=132 females). Overall, the mean age of all 
participants was 37±6.5 years and they were within normal body weight 
(BMI=23±4.0). Many participants (n=85, 40%) had low PA levels followed by those 
who were moderately physically active (n=75, 36%). A larger proportion of the 
female participants (51%) had low PA levels compared to males (22%). Forty-two 
percent of participants with 1-3 years of ART had low PA whereas 39% with >3 
years ART had low PA.
CONCLUSION: Most PLWHIV and receiving ART in the sample have low PA levels. The 
study has also revealed that proportionally more females than males had low PA 
levels.

The steady increase in life-expectancy of world population, coupled to many 
genetic and environmental factors (for instance, pre- and post-natal exposures 
to environmental neurotoxins), predispose to the onset of neurodegenerative 
diseases, whose prevalence is expected to increase dramatically in the next 
years. Recent studies have proposed links between the gut microbiota and 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Human 
body is a complex structure where bacterial and human cells are almost equal in 
numbers, and most microbes are metabolically active in the gut, where they 
potentially influence other target organs, including the brain. The role of gut 
microbiota in the development and pathophysiology of the human brain is an area 
of growing interest for the scientific community. Several microbial-derived 
neurochemicals involved in the gut-microbiota-brain crosstalk seem implicated in 
the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopment and 
neurodegeneration. Evidence supporting these connections has come from model 
systems, but there are still unsolved issues due to several limitations of 
available research tools. New technologies are recently born to help 
understanding the causative role of gut microbes in neurodegeneration. This 
review aims to make an overview of recent advances in the study of the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by: (a) 
identifying specific microbial pathological signaling pathways; (b) 
characterizing new, advanced engineered tools to study the interactions between 
human cells and gut bacteria.

Osteoarthritis (OA) in articular joints is a prevalent disease. With increasing 
life expectancy, the need for therapies other than knee replacement arises. The 
intrinsic repair capacity of cartilage is limited, therefore alternative 
strategies for cartilage regeneration are being explored. The purpose of this 
study is first to investigate the potential of platelet lysate (PL) as a 
xeno-free alternative in expansion of human OA chondrocytes for cell therapy, 
and second to assess the effects of PL on redifferentiation of expanded 
chondrocytes in 3D pellet cultures. Chondrocytes were isolated from human OA 
cartilage and subjected to PL in monolayer culture. Cell proliferation, 
morphology, and expression of chondrogenic genes were assessed. Next, 
PL-expanded chondrocytes were cultured in 3D cell pellets and cartilage matrix 
production was assessed after 28 days. In addition, the supplementation of PL to 
redifferentiation medium for the culture of expanded chondrocytes in 3D pellets 
was evaluated. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen production were evaluated by 
quantitative biochemical analyses, as well as by (immuno)histochemistry. A 
dose-dependent effect of PL on chondrocyte proliferation was found, but 
expression of chondrogenic markers was decreased when compared to FBS-expanded 
cells. After 28 days of subsequent 3D pellet culture, GAG production was 
significantly higher in pellets consisting of chondrocytes expanded with PL 
compared to controls. However, when used to supplement redifferentiation medium 
for chondrocyte pellets, PL significantly decreased the production of GAGs and 
collagen. In conclusion, chondrocyte proliferation is stimulated by PL and 
cartilage production in subsequent 3D culture is maintained. Furthermore, the 
presences of PL during redifferentiation of 3D chondrocyte strongly inhibits GAG 
and collagen content. The data presented in the current study indicate that 
while the use of PL for expansion in cartilage cell therapies is possibly 
beneficial, intra-articular injection of the product in the treatment of OA 
might be questioned.

We previously developed a surface-assisted assay to image early steps of 
cell-induced plasma fibronectin (FN) fibrillogenesis by timelapse atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). Unexpectedly, complementary attempts to visualize FN 
fibrillogenesis using fluorescently labeled FN (Alexa Fluor 488 or 568) and 
live-cell light microscopy initially failed consistently. Further analysis 
revealed that fibrillar remodeling was inhibited efficiently in the focal area 
illuminated during fluorescence imaging, but progressed normally elsewhere on 
the substrate, suggesting photo sensitivity of the FN fibrillogenesis process. 
In agreement, active cell-driven fibrillar extension of FN could be stopped by 
transient illumination with visible light during AFM timelapse scanning. 
Phototoxic effects on the cells could be ruled out, because pre-illuminating the
