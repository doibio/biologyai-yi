BACKGROUND: The REACH-HF (Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure) 
trial found that the REACH-HF home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention 
resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-specific 
health-related quality of life in patients with reduced ejection fraction heart 
failure (HFrEF). The aims of this study were to assess the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of the addition of REACH-HF intervention or home-based 
cardiac rehabilitation to usual care compared with usual care alone in patients 
with HFrEF.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed using a patient lifetime 
horizon and integrating evidence from the REACH-HF trial, a systematic 
review/meta-analysis of randomised trials, estimates of mortality and hospital 
admission and UK costs at 2015/2016 prices. Taking a UK National Health and 
Personal Social Services perspective we report the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, assessing uncertainty using 
probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, the REACH-HF intervention was associated with 
per patient mean QALY gain of 0.23 and an increased mean cost of £400 compared 
with usual care, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of £1720. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicated a 78% probability that REACH-HF is cost effective 
versus usual care at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. Results were 
similar for home-based cardiac rehabilitation versus usual care. Sensitivity 
analyses indicate the findings to be robust to changes in model assumptions and 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cost-utility analyses indicate that the addition of the 
REACH-HF intervention and home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are 
likely to be cost-effective treatment options versus usual care alone in 
patients with HFrEF.

OBJECTIVES: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial has shown 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage 
small-cell lung cancer could significantly prolong overall survival and 
progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. This study aimed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment 
for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung from an American perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Basic medical information was derived from the 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (IMpower133, NCT02763579). A 
Markov model was developed to simulate the process of small-cell lung cancer, 
including three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive 
disease (PD), and death. Utilities and costs were obtained from published 
resources. Sensitivity analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential 
variables.
RESULTS: Treatment with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was estimated to increase 
costs by $52,881compared with chemotherapy alone, with a gain of 0.10 quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs), leading to an incremental cost-effective ratio of 
$528,810 per QALY. The cost of PFS state and atezolizumab were the most 
influential factors to the model.
CONCLUSION: The combination of atezolizumab, carboplatin and etoposide is not a 
cost-effective choice in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC from 
an American perspective.

BACKGROUND: Reviews of economic evaluations of public health (PH) interventions 
assessed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the 
periods 2005-2010 and 2011-2016 have been undertaken. This study combines these 
analyses, adds six further guidelines published since then, and thus provides a 
summary of cost-effectiveness of NICE's PH interventions to the present.
METHODS: As in previous studies, economic evaluations carried out between 2005 
and 2018 were categorised by the type of economic analysis used to extract and 
summarise base-case ICERs. A number of 'sensitivity analyses' were carried out 
to test the validity of the approach.
RESULTS: Of 71 guidelines examined, 27 used cost utility analysis (CUA) for 
specific interventions, yielding 380 individual base-case ICER estimates (or 221 
taking into account clustering of interventions). The median cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ICER for the 380 estimates was £1,986. Of 
these, 21% were cost saving, and 54% ranged from £1 to £20,000, 3% were between 
£20,001 and £30,000, 16% were above £30,000 and 5% were dominated. Taking 
clustering into account made relatively little difference to these results. 
Reducing the threshold from £20,000/QALY to £15,000/QALY would result in 2% of 
ICERs moving across the threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-five percent of PH interventions assessed were 
cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY when disregarding clustering, 
and 68% were cost-effective when clusters were represented by a single ICER. 
Other analyses gave similar results for the distribution of ICERs. Limitations 
of the analysis are discussed.

Transcriptome-wide targeted genotyping is highly attractive for evolutionary and 
ecological studies but, until recently, accomplishing this goal presented a 
major technical barrier for the study of non-model organisms. Our group has 
recently developed a high-throughput targeted genotyping approach (called 
HD-Marker) based on the high specificity and accuracy of oligo 
extension-ligation assays that facilitates the design of assays tailored to meet 
specific genotyping needs. HD-Marker allows for targeted genotyping of over 10 
000 genes in a single tube, with strikingly high capture rate (98%-99%) and 
genotyping accuracy (97%-99%). With the remarkable advantages of 
cost-effectiveness and flexibility, we envision that HD-Marker has broad 
application potential in evolutionary and ecological studies.

Challenging the proposed causes of the PCR plateau phase.

Despite the wide-spread use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in various 
life-science applications, the causes of arrested amplicon generation in late 
cycles have not been confidently identified. This so-called plateau phase has 
been attributed to depletion or thermal break-down of primers or nucleotides, 
thermal inactivation of the DNA polymerase, and product accumulation resulting 
in competition between primer annealing and product re-hybridization as well as 
blocking of DNA polymerase by double-stranded amplicons. In the current study, 
we experimentally investigate the proposed limiting factors of PCR product 
formation. By applying robust and validated qPCR assays, we elucidate the impact 
of adding non-target and target amplicons to the reactions, mimicking the high 
amount of products in late PCR cycles. Further, the impact of increased primer 
concentrations and thermal stability of reagents are explored. Our results show 
that high amounts of non-target amplicons inhibit amplification by binding to 
the DNA polymerase, but that this effect is counteracted by addition of more DNA 
polymerase or prolonged annealing/extension times. Adding high amounts of target 
amplicons that also act as templates in the reaction is far less inhibitory to 
amplification, although a decrease in amplification rate is seen. When primer 
concentrations are increased, both amplification rates and end-product yields 
are elevated. Taken together, our results suggest that the main cause of PCR 
plateau formation is primer depletion and not product accumulation or 
degradation of reagents. We stress that a PCR plateau caused by primer depletion 
is assay-dependent, i.e. dependent on the primer design and primer 
characteristics such as the probability of primer-dimer formation. Our findings 
contribute to an improved understanding of the major parameters controlling the 
PCR dynamics at later cycles and the limitations of continued product formation, 
which in the end can facilitate PCR optimization.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modern oncology is witnessing a renaissance of its 
pharmacologic armamentarium. Old generation drugs, such as anthracyclines and 
other cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs, were plagued with a lack of specificity and 
with the possible occurrence of untoward effects in the cardiovascular system 
and other healthy tissues. The old drugs are now combined with, or replaced by, 
new agents that are more specific in attacking some unique moieties and vital 
functions of cancer cells, causing less noxious effects in healthy tissues. 
Regrettably, however, the new "targeted" drugs still cause varying levels of 
cardiac or vascular toxicity. Here, we describe the case of trastuzumab, a 
monoclonal antibody that dramatically improved the life expectancy of women with 
Erbb2-overexpressing breast tumor, while also raising concerns about a possible 
incidence of cardiac dysfunction.
RECENT FINDINGS: The scientific community counts experts that label trastuzumab 
as a "cardiotoxic agent" and other experts that maintain a more benign 
assessment. We describe the biologic foundations and clinical evidence for such 
controversy. We show that trastuzumab cardiotoxicity is probably overrated, 
leading some experts to raise unjustified overconcerns about the cardiotoxicity 
of trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination with anthracyclines or other 
old and new drugs. We analyze the biases that caused trastuzumab cardiotoxicity 
to be overrated. Trastuzumab is a life-saving agent showing a moderate and 
clinically manageable cardiac dysfunction, and yet, it is portrayed as 
cardiotoxic. We take the trastuzumab lesson to reaffirm that cardio-oncologists 
should provide cancer patients with the best therapeutic opportunity, as is the 
case for trastuzumab, while also devising the necessary strategies of risk 
assessment and mitigation.

The working group recommends against contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) 
in women with breast cancer without a family history or genetic predisposition 
with unilateral breast cancer. This is based on the low risk of developing 
contralateral breast cancer, the lack of a survival benefit, the increased risk 
of surgical complications, and the lack of benefit on quality of life.

Spillover Effects on Caregivers' and Family Members' Utility: A Systematic 
Review of the Literature.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of research has identified health-related 
quality-of-life effects for caregivers and family members of ill patients (i.e. 
'spillover effects'), yet these are rarely considered in cost-effectiveness 
analyses (CEAs).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to catalog spillover-related health 
utilities to facilitate their consideration in CEAs.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the medical and economic literatures 
(MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EconLit, from inception through 3 April 2018) to identify 
articles that reported preference-based measures of spillover effects. We used 
keywords for utility measures combined with caregivers, family members, and 
burden.
RESULTS: Of 3695 articles identified, 80 remained after screening: 8 (10%) 
reported spillover utility per se, as utility or disutility (i.e. utility loss); 
25 (30%) reported a comparison group, either population values (n = 9) or 
matched, non-caregiver/family member or unaffected individuals' utilities 
(n = 16; 3 reported both spillover and a comparison group); and 50 (63%) 
reported caregiver/family member utilities only. Alzheimer's disease/dementia 
was the most commonly studied disease/condition, and the EQ-5D was the most 
commonly used measurement instrument.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive catalog of utilities showcases the spectrum of 
diseases and conditions for which caregiver and family members' spillover 
effects have been measured, and the variation in measurement methods used. In 
general, utilities indicated a loss in quality of life associated with being a 
caregiver or family member of an ill relative. Most studies reported 
caregiver/family member utility without any comparator, limiting the ability to 
infer spillover effects. Nevertheless, these values provide a starting point for 
considering spillover effects in the context of CEA, opening the door for more 
comprehensive analyses.

The Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin for the Treatment 
of Adult Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: An 
Evidence Review Group Evaluation of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Pfizer, the 
manufacturer of inotuzumab ozogamicin (henceforth inotuzumab), to submit 
clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for inotuzumab as part of NICE's 
single technology appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination 
and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were 
commissioned as the independent evidence review group (ERG). The 
clinical-effectiveness data were from a multicentre randomised controlled trial 
that compared inotuzumab with standard of care (SoC), where SoC was the 
investigator's choice of chemotherapy. Inotuzumab demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements in response rates or in the proportion of patients 
progressing to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but failed to meet the 
second primary objective of longer overall survival. Treatment-emergent adverse 
events were more frequent in the SoC arm, except veno-occlusive disease, which 
was more frequent in the inotuzumab arm. The company's economic model split 
patients into three post-hoc subgroups and used a partitioned survival approach 
within each group, with a cure assumption 3 years after receiving HSCT. In 
contrast with the trial results, the economic model estimated substantial 
improvement in survival with inotuzumab compared with SoC, providing an 
additional 5.2 life-years and 2.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using a 
discount rate of 1.5% per annum. The ERG's critique highlighted a number of 
concerns, including the use of a post-hoc post-randomisation patient subset for 
extrapolation, the choice of a 1.5% discount rate, the complexity of the 
parametric modelling, the assumption of further treatment benefit post-HSCT, the 
nature of the cure assumption, and the length of inpatient stay while receiving 
treatment. The combination of the ERG's adjustments resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £122,174 per QALY gained using Kaplan-Meier 
survival estimates and £114,078 per QALY gained with parametric survival models 
fit to the trial data. The final determination of the appraisal followed four 
NICE Appraisal Committee meetings, an appeal by the company and other 
stakeholders, two patient access schemes, and a company response to each 
appraisal consultation. The final ICER post-consultation was between £33,749 and 
£37,497 per QALY gained compared with SoC (excluding the confidential discount 
for blinatumomab received as subsequent therapy). The Appraisal Committee 
concluded that the ICER for inotuzumab was within the range usually considered 
cost effective for end-of-life care and recommended inotuzumab within its 
licensed indication.

Background: Examining the premature death rate represents the first step in 
estimating the overall burden of disease, reflecting a full picture of how 
different causes affect population health and providing a way of monitoring and 
evaluating population health. Aims: This study was conducted to assess the 
burden of premature mortality from suicides in West Azerbaijan Province, 
northwest of Iran from 2014 to 2016. Method: To calculate years of potential 
life lost (YPLL), we categorized all methods of suicide, then we subtracted 
actual age at death by suicide from the relevant age-based life table produced 
by the World Health Organization in 2015, after which we added the results for 
each type of suicide in a particular year. Results: We analyzed 638 suicides. 
Overall, during the 3-year study period for both sexes, the greatest sources of 
premature death among all methods of suicide were: hanging, strangulation, and 
suffocation (X70); smoke, fire, and flames (X76); and poisoning by narcotics and 
psychodysleptics (X62). Limitations: Limitations of the study include a lack of 
accurate, systematic recording and reporting of all cases of suicide, which 
might lead to measurement bias. Conclusion: This study identified and 
highlighted the most common methods of suicide in West Azerbaijan.

With an increasingly ageing population that is expected to double by 2050 in the 
U.S., it is paramount that we further understand the neurological changes that 
occur during ageing. This is relevant not only in the context of "pathological" 
ageing, where the development of many neurodegenerative disorders is typically a 
feature of only the older population (and indeed, age is the primary risk factor 
for many conditions such as Alzheimer's disease), but also for what is 
considered to be "normal" or "healthy" ageing. Specifically, a significant 
proportion of the older population are affected by "age-related cognitive 
decline" (ARCD), which is both independent of dementia and has an incidence 70% 
higher than dementia alone. However, whilst it is reported that there are 
pathogenic and phenotypic overlaps between healthy and pathological ageing, it 
is clear that there is a need to identify the pathways and understand the 
mechanisms that contribute to this loss of cognitive function with normal 
ageing, particularly in light of the increasing life expectancy of the global 
population. Importantly, there is an increasing body of evidence implicating 
zinc homeostasis as a key player in learning and memory and also potentially 
ARCD. Further research will ultimately contribute to the development of targeted 
therapeutics that will promote successful brain ageing. In this chapter we will 
explore the notion of ARCD, with a perspective on potential key neurochemical 
pathways that can be targeted for future intervention.

During the past decades, life expectancy of subjects with Down syndrome (DS) has 
greatly improved, but age-specific mortality rates are still important and DS 
subjects are characterized by an acceleration of the ageing process, which 
affects particularly the immune and central nervous systems. In this chapter, we 
will first review the characteristics of the ageing phenomenon in brain and in 
immune system in DS and we will then discuss the biological hallmarks of ageing 
in this specific population. Finally, we will also consider in detail the 
knowledge on epigenetics in DS, particularly DNA methylation.

Aging, as a physiological process mediated by numerous regulatory pathways and 
transcription factors, is manifested by continuous progressive functional 
decline and increasing risk of chronic diseases. There is an increasing interest 
to identify pharmacological agents for treatment and prevention of age-related 
disease in humans. Animal models play an important role in identification and 
testing of anti-aging compounds; this step is crucial before the drug will enter 
human clinical trial or will be introduced to human medicine. One of the main 
goals of animal studies is better understanding of mechanistic targets, 
therapeutic implications and side-effects of the drug, which may be later 
translated into humans. In this chapter, we summarized the effects of different 
drugs reported to extend the lifespan in model organisms from round worms to 
rodents. Resveratrol, rapamycin, metformin and aspirin, showing effectiveness in 
model organism life- and healthspan extension mainly target the master 
regulators of aging such as mTOR, FOXO and PGC1α, affecting autophagy, 
inflammation and oxidative stress. In humans, these drugs were demonstrated to 
reduce inflammation, prevent CVD, and slow down the functional decline in 
certain organs. Additionally, potential anti-aging pharmacologic agents inhibit 
cancerogenesis, interfering with certain aspects of cell metabolism, 
proliferation, angioneogenesis and apoptosis.

OBJECTIVE: To advance the goal of "Grand Convergence" in global health by 2035, 
this study tested the convergence hypothesis in the progress of the health 
status of individuals from 193 countries, using both standard and cutting-edge 
convergence metrics.
METHODS: The study used multiple data sources. The methods section is 
categorized into two parts. (1) Health inequality measures were used for 
estimating inter-country inequalities. Dispersion Measure of Mortality (DMM) is 
used for measuring absolute inequality and Gini Coefficient for relative 
inequality. (2) We tested the standard convergence hypothesis for the progress 
in Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) during 1950 to 
2015 using methods ranging from simple graphical tools (catching-up plots) to 
standard parametric (absolute β and σ-convergence) and nonparametric econometric 
models (kernel density estimates) to detect the presence of convergence (or 
divergence) and convergence clubs.
FINDINGS: The findings lend support to the "rise and fall" of world health 
inequalities measured using Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) and Infant Mortality 
Rate (IMR). The test of absolute β-convergence for the entire period and in the 
recent period supports the convergence hypothesis for LEB (β = -0.0210 [95% CI 
-0.0227 - -0.0194], p<0.000) and rejects it for IMR (β = 0.0063 [95% CI 
0.0037-0.0089], p<0.000). However, results also suggest a setback in the speed 
of convergence in health status across the countries in recent times, 5.4% 
during 1950-55 to 1980-85 compared to 3% during 1985-90 to 2010-15. Although 
inequality based convergence metrics showed evidence of divergence replacing 
convergence during 1985-90 to 2000-05, from the late 2000s, divergence was 
replaced by re-convergence although with a slower speed of convergence. While 
the non-parametric test of convergence shows an emerging process of regional 
convergence rather than global convergence.
CONCLUSION: We found that with a current rate of progress (2.2% per annum) the 
"Grand convergence" in global health can be achieved only by 2060 instead of 
2035. We suggest that a roadmap to achieve "Grand Convergence" in global health 
should include more radical changes and work for increasing efficiency with 
equity to achieve a "Grand convergence" in health status across the countries by 
2035.

OBJECTIVES: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has a unique worldwide racial and 
geographic distribution. Our objective was to evaluate socioeconomic disparities 
in the burden of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) between endemic and nonendemic 
regions.
METHODS: To demonstrate trends regarding societal burden of NPC and 
socioeconomic development, national disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates 
and human development indices (HDI) between 1990 and 2015 were evaluated. 
Countries were divided based on the endemic versus nonendemic presence of NPC 
and further analyzed by HDI status as specified by the United Nations 
Development Program. Gini coefficients and concentration index were used to 
evaluate global equality in NPC burden over this period.
RESULTS: Age-standardized DALYs dropped from 36.1 in 1990 to 26.5 in 2015 (26.6% 
decline) (r = -0.991, P < 0.001). Lower socioeconomic countries harbored greater 
NPC burden upon controlling by endemic and nonendemic regions, as demonstrated 
by progressively negative concentration indexes. Health inequality was greater 
in nonendemic countries than in endemic countries (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate 
socioeconomic-related changes in NPC burden using statistical tools such as the 
Gini coefficient and concentration index. Although the burden of NPC has 
steadily decreased, there remain persistent inequalities associated with 
socioeconomic disparities. Nasopharyngeal cancer burden is more pronounced in 
countries with lower HDI. Our results reinforce the importance of increasing 
resources for developing countries and continuing inquiry into the screening, 
diagnosis, and management of NPC.

OBJECTIVE: Older people approaching the end of life are at a high risk for 
adverse drug reactions. Approaching the end of life should change the 
therapeutic aims, triggering a reduction in the number of drugs.The main aim of 
this study is to describe the preventive and symptomatic drug treatments 
prescribed to patients discharged with a limited life expectancy from internal 
medicine and geriatric wards. The secondary aim was to describe the potentially 
severe drug-drug interactions (DDI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed Registry of Polytherapies Societa Italiana di 
Medicina Interna (REPOSI), a network of internal medicine and geriatric wards, 
to describe the drug therapy of patients discharged with a limited life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: The study sample comprised 55 patients discharged with a limited life 
expectancy. Patients with at least 1 preventive medication that could be 
considered for deprescription at the end of life were significantly fewer from 
admission to discharge (n = 30; 54.5% vs. n = 21; 38.2%; p = 0.02). 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, 
calcium channel blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and clonidine were the most 
frequent potentially avoidable medications prescribed at discharge, followed by 
xanthine oxidase inhibitors and drugs to prevent fractures. Thirty-seven (67.3%) 
patients were also exposed to at least 1 potentially severe DDI at discharge.
CONCLUSION: Hospital discharge is associated with a small reduction in the use 
of commonly prescribed preventive medications in patients discharged with a 
limited life expectancy. Cardiovascular drugs are the most frequent potentially 
avoidable preventive medications. A consensus framework or shared criteria for 
potentially inappropriate medication in elderly patients with limited life 
expectancy could be useful to further improve drug prescription.

Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignant neoplasms. In 
Hungary, 4000-4500 men are diagnosed annually, which is below the European 
incidence. In contrast, the Hungarian prostate cancer mortality clearly exceeds 
the EU average. This is probably due to the lack of awareness and early 
recognition of prostate cancer. At an early stage, prostate cancer can be cured, 
5-year survival is almost 100%, while in metastatic form it is only 28%. There 
are several treatment options available for prostate cancer. Since it is 
multiplex within the organ and the cancer foci are histopathologically 
heterogeneous, only the treatment of the whole prostate is curative. Radical 
prostatectomy is the only curative treatment that can provide a complete healing 
and increased life expectancy in men with prostate cancer. It is recommended to 
be performed in men with a life expectancy of at least 10 years. During surgery, 
the prostate is removed, along with its capsule, seminal vesicles on both sides 
and pelvic lymph nodes. During surgery, the urinary continence and, if possible, 
erectile function should be preserved.

Publisher: A prosztatarák az egyik leggyakrabban diagnosztizált rosszindulatú 
daganatos megbetegedés. Magyarországon évente 4000-4500 férfiban kerül 
felismerésre, mellyel a hazai incidencia az európai átlag alatt van, de 
mortalitása azt jóval meghaladja. Ennek hátterében a prosztatarák-tudatosság és 
a korai felismerés hiánya áll. Korai stádiumban a prosztatarák gyógyítható, az 5 
éves túlélés csaknem 100%, míg áttétes formában ez csak 28%. Prosztatarák 
felismerése esetén többféle kezelési lehetõség áll rendelkezésünkre. Mivel a 
prosztatarák szerven belül legtöbbször multiplex elhelyezkedésû és a rákos gócok 
kórszövettanilag heterogének, csak a prosztata egészét érintõ kezelés kuratív. A 
radikális prosztatektómia az egyetlen gyógyító jellegû kezelés, mely igazoltan 
és önmagában teljes gyógyulást és emelkedett életkilátást nyújthat a 
prosztatarákos férfiakban. Elvégzése abban az esetben javasolt, ha a várható 
élettartam legalább 10 év és a beteg a biopszia szövettana alapján magas 
kockázatú. A mûtét során eltávolításra kerül a prosztata a tokjával együtt, a 
kétoldali ondómirigyek és kismedencei nyirokcsomók. A mûtét során törekedni kell 
a vizelettartási képesség és lehetõség szerint a merevedési képesség 
megõrzésére.

Stents are important medical devices used to increase the quality and life 
expectancy of patients with heart diseases and stroke, leading causes of death, 
worldwide. In order to minimize the risk of restenosis, different coating on 
bare metal stents (BMS) such as polymer coatings; titanium dioxide, titanium 
nitride or titanium oxynitride coatings; carbon coatings and others are used. 
The aim of this work was to develop novel stents coated with titanium oxynitride 
(TiOxNy) with optimal chemical, mechanical and biological properties having 
possibly good coverage rate of inner and outer stent surfaces. The improvement 
should be achieved by optimization and development of a magnetron sputtering 
deposition technology. The goal of the study is understanding of the existing 
potential for improvement of the deposition technology and the coating quality 
itself. For this study, different O2/N2 ratios, meaning 1/2, 1/5 and 1/10 (the 
ratios of reagent gasses are given for the values of mass flows into the 
chamber) has been selected. Stability in simulated body fluids, surface 
morphology and protein adsorption as well as preliminary cytotoxic behaviour of 
the samples on HUVEC cells has been analysed. SEM experiments have shown the 
potential in the improvement of coating-stent adhesion by all samples. TiOxNy 
1:5 samples were found to have the lowest adsorption, the smoothest surface 
morphology and the smallest rate of salt deposition from simulated body fluids 
(SBFs). This kind of surface has been recommended for further optimization and 
application.

Background Asian-American subgroups (Asian-Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, 
Japanese, and Vietnamese) display varied cardiovascular disease mortality 
patterns, especially at younger ages. This study aims to examine the years of 
potential life lost because of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular 
disease among the 6 largest Asian-American subgroups compared with non-Hispanic 
whites. Methods and Results We used National Center for Health Statistics 
Multiple Causes of Death mortality files from 2003 to 2012 to calculate 
race-specific life expectancy, mean years of potential life lost, and years of 
potential life lost per 100 000 population for each Asian subgroup and 
non-Hispanic whites. Asian-American subgroups display heterogeneity in 
cardiovascular disease burden. Asian-Indians had a high burden of ischemic heart 
disease; Asian-Indian men lost 724 years per 100 000 population in 2012 and a 
mean of 17 years to ischemic heart disease. Respectively, Vietnamese and 
Filipino men and women lost a mean of 17 and 16 years of life to cerebrovascular 
disease; Filipino men lost 352 years per 100 000 population in 2012. All Asian 
subgroups for both sexes had higher years of life lost to cerebrovascular 
disease compared with non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions Cardiovascular disease 
burden varies among Asian subgroups, and contributes to greater premature 
mortality in certain subgroups. Asian-Indian and Filipino populations have the 
highest years of life lost because of ischemic heart disease and Filipino and 
Vietnamese have the highest years of life lost because of cerebrovascular 
disease. Analysis of risk factors and development of subgroup-specific 
interventions are required to address these health disparities.
