BACKGROUND: Starting with early identification of palliative care patients by 
general practitioners (GPs), the Care Pathway for Primary Palliative Care 
(CPPPC) is believed to help primary health care workers to deliver patient- and 
family-centered care in the last year of life. The care pathway has been 
pilot-tested, and will now be implemented in 5 Belgian regions: 2 Dutch-speaking 
regions, 2 French-speaking regions and the bilingual capital region of Brussels. 
The overall aim of the CPPPC is to provide better quality of primary palliative 
care, and in the end to reduce the hospital death rate. The aim of this article 
is to describe the quantitative design and innovative data collection strategy 
used in the evaluation of this complex intervention.
METHODS/DESIGN: A quasi-experimental stepped wedge cluster design is set up with 
the 5 regions being 5 non-randomized clusters. The primary outcome is reduced 
hospital death rate per GPs' patient population. Secondary outcomes are 
increased death at home and health care consumption patterns suggesting high 
quality palliative care. Per research cluster, GPs will be recruited via 
convenience sampling. These GPs -volunteering to be involved will recruit people 
with reduced life expectancy and their informal care givers. Health care 
consumption data in the last year of life, available for all deceased people 
having lived in the research clusters in the study period, will be used for 
comparison between patient populations of participating GPs and patient 
populations of non-participating GPs. Description of baseline characteristics of 
participating GPs and patients and monitoring of the level of involvement by 
GPs, patients and informal care givers will happen through regular, 
privacy-secured web-surveys. Web-survey data and health consumption data are 
linked in a secure way, respecting Belgian privacy laws.
DISCUSSION: To evaluate this complex intervention, a quasi-experimental stepped 
wedge cluster design has been set up. Context characteristics and involvement 
level of participants are important parameters in evaluating complex 
interventions. It is possible to securely link survey data with health 
consumption data. By appealing to IT solutions we hope to be able to partly 
reduce respondent burden, a known problem in palliative care research.

Socio-economic cultural transformations and Depression in elderly people.

Stranieri G(1), Carabetta C.

Italy, straniti@virgilio.it.

The socio-economic and cultural evolution in the last decades encouraged a 
significant process of transformation of the life conditions in advanced 
societies, particularly the average duration of the life of the elderly 
population, which since the second half of the past century has increased by 
about 60%, becoming from an average of fifty years to about eighty two for women 
and eighty for men. This phenomenon enables scholars and in particular 
demography scholars, to assume that in 2030 the number of elderly persons will 
reach about two billion worldwide. This development of an increasingly longer 
life expectancy, justifies the trust in the great progress that characterizes 
our society. The rapid growth of this segment of population, due to the improved 
living conditions and the related progress in science, technology and medicine, 
in addition to its positive aspects, also includes negative elements, which 
already affect the Welfare State and, more generally, the public administration 
that is called to fill the gaps that the transformation of the family and 
kinship networks have treated with indifference. The problems of the 
increasingly long-lived, is not freed from new elements of negativity related to 
the physical and mental decline that leads to the development of new diseases in 
addition to those already present, ans is increasingly motivated to seek the 
best remedies to shorten or eliminate the diseases of the elderly. In this 
context, Depression assumes a central dimension which will surely be a central 
concern for the economic, social and health impact and for the multitude of 
changes that put in crisis many of the traditional institutions. This work aims 
to analyze through a careful review of the scientific literature, the causes of 
the spread of this disease, the diagnostic difficulties and possible solutions 
for prevention and care.

[Level of and change in road traffic mortality in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and 
Mexico, 2000-2011].

The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of run-over fatalities and 
traffic collisions in life expectancy in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, 
between 2000 and 2011. Years of life expectancy lost (YLEL) were calculated for 
the periods 2000-2002 and 2009-2011. The results show that road traffic deaths 
made up between 1% and 4% of all deaths in each country. In the first period, 
the highest level of mortality occurred in Colombia (YLEL=0.96) and the lowest 
in Argentina (YLEL=0.59). In all the countries studied except Argentina, the 
impact of these deaths on life expectancy was reduced in the second period. The 
main change took place in Colombia, reaching 0.72 YLEL in the second period. It 
is concluded that traffic-related deaths have a negative impact on health 
systems, victims, the productive sector, and society in general. From this point 
of view, the issue of road transit must be considered a matter of public health, 
requiring multi-sector intervention in the design of national and regional 
policies.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases risk of stroke, and although this 
stroke risk can be ameliorated by warfarin therapy, some patients decline to 
adhere to warfarin therapy. A prospective clinical study could be conducted to 
determine whether knowledge of genetic risk for AF could increase adherence to 
warfarin therapy for patients who initially declined therapy. As a prelude to a 
potential prospective clinical study, we investigated whether the use of genetic 
information to increase adherence could be cost effective.
METHODS: Markov model assessed costs and utilities of two care strategies for AF 
patients who declined warfarin therapy. In the usual care strategy patients 
received aspirin. In the test strategy genetic risk for AF was assessed 
(genotype of the 4q25 locus) and some patients with a positive genetic test (≥1 
risk allele) were assumed to adhere to warfarin therapy. The remaining patients 
received aspirin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was the ratio 
of the costs differential and the quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
differential for the two strategies.
RESULTS: We found that the 4q25 genetic testing strategy, compared with the 
usual care strategy (aspirin therapy), would be cost-effective (ICER $ 47,148) 
if 2.1 % or more of the test positive patients were to adhere to warfarin 
therapy. The test strategy would become a cost saving strategy if 5.3 % or more 
of the test positive patients were to adhere to warfarin therapy. If 20 % of 
test positive patients were to adhere to warfarin therapy in a hypothetical 
cohort of 1000 patients, 7 stroke events would be prevented and 3 extra-cranial 
major bleeding events would be caused over 5 years, resulting in a cost savings 
of ~ $250,000 and a net gain of 9 QALYs.
DISCUSSION: A clinical study to assess the impact of patient knowledge of 
genetic risk of AF on adherence to warfarin therapy would be merited because 
even a modest increase in patient adherence would make a genetic testing 
strategy cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Providing patients who declined warfarin therapy with information 
about their genetic risk of AF would be cost effective if this genetic risk 
information resulted in modest increases in adherence.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health outcomes and economics associated with the 
current guidance relating to the prevention of falls in the elderly through 
vitamin D supplementation.
SETTING: UK.
PARTICIPANTS: UK population aged 60 years and above.
INTERVENTIONS: A Markov health state transition model simulated patient 
transitions between key fall-related outcomes using a 5-year horizon and annual 
cycles to assess the costs and benefits of empirical treatment with 
colecalciferol 800 iu daily.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and health outcomes attributable 
to fall prevention following vitamin D supplementation.
RESULTS: Our model shows that treating the UK population aged 60 years and above 
with 800 iu colecalciferol would, over a 5-year period: (1) prevent in excess of 
430,000 minor falls; (2) avoid 190,000 major falls; (3) prevent 1579 acute 
deaths; (4) avoid 84,000 person-years of long-term care and (5) prevent 8300 
deaths associated with increased mortality in long-term care. The greatest gains 
are seen among those 75 years and older. Based on reduction in falls alone, the 
intervention in all adults aged 65+ is cost-saving and leads to increased 
quality adjusted life years. Treating all adults aged 60+ incurs an intervention 
cost of £2.70bn over 5 years, yet produces a -£3.12bn reduction in fall-related 
costs; a net saving of £420M. Increasing the lower bound age limit by 5-year 
increments increases budget impact to -£1.17bn, -£1.75bn, and -£2.06bn for 
adults 65+, 70+ and 75+, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that treatment of the elderly UK population with 
colecalciferol 800 iu daily would be associated with reductions in mortality and 
substantial cost-savings through fall prevention.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care (PC) patients experience loss of physical function 
which usually impedes mobility, autonomy and quality of life. We aimed at 
examining the feasibility of a home-based exercise program for patients with 
advanced, incurable diseases after discharge.
RESULTS: This was a single-arm pilot study (WHO-ICTRP: DRKS00005048). The 
12-week home-based program comprised strength, balance, flexibility and 
endurance components. Patients with a presumed life expectancy of 6-12 months 
were recruited during a 6-months period on a specialized PC and a radiation 
therapy ward. We chose the De Morton Mobility Index as primary outcome. 
Secondary outcomes were quality of life, 6-min walk test and others. A total of 
145 patients were screened, 103 (98%) out of 105 patients on the specialized PC 
ward could not be included, mostly because of a low performance status [n = 94; 
90%; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) >2]. The only two eligible 
patients declined to participate. Eleven out of 40 patients (28%) were eligible 
on the radiation therapy ward. However, only one patient (9%) participated but 
dropped out 2 days later (upcoming surgery). Distance to the hospital (n = 3; 
30%) and considering additional tasks as "too much" (n = 3; 30%) were most 
common reasons for non-participation.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a home-based exercise program for inpatients after 
discharge was not feasible mainly due to non-eligibility and lack of demand. For 
future trials, we suggest that choosing (1) outpatients with (2) an ECOG of ≤2 
and (3) an estimated survival of ≥9 months could enhance participation in 
home-based exercise programs.

Although the demographic revolution has produced hundreds of millions people 
aged 65 and older, a substantial segment of that population is not enjoying the 
benefits of extended healthspan. Many live with multiple chronic conditions and 
disabilities that erode the quality of life. The consequences are also costly 
for society. In the United States, the most costly 5% of Medicare beneficiaries 
account for approximately 50% of Medicare's expenditures. This perspective 
summarizes a recent workshop on biomedical approaches to best extend healthspan 
as way to reduce age-related dysfunction and disability. We further specify the 
action items necessary to unite health professionals, scientists, and the 
society to partner around the exciting and palpable opportunities to extend 
healthspan.

Discrimination based on weight is a stressful social experience linked to 
declines in physical and mental health. We examined whether this harmful 
association extends to risk of mortality. Participants in the Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS; N = 13,692) and the Midlife in the United States Study 
(MIDUS; N = 5,079) reported on perceived discriminatory experiences and 
attributed those experiences to a number of personal characteristics, including 
weight. Weight discrimination was associated with an increase in mortality risk 
of nearly 60% in both HRS participants (hazard ratio = 1.57, 95% confidence 
interval = [1.34, 1.84]) and MIDUS participants (hazard ratio = 1.59, 95% 
confidence interval = [1.09, 2.31]). This increased risk was not accounted for 
by common physical and psychological risk factors. The association between 
mortality and weight discrimination was generally stronger than that between 
mortality and other attributions for discrimination. In addition to its 
association with poor health outcomes, weight discrimination may shorten life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing the Grip on Challenging Behaviour care programme (GRIP) on dementia 
special care units in comparison with usual care.
METHODS: A stepped wedge design was used. Challenging behaviour and quality of 
life were measured using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the 
QUALIDEM. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the 
EuroQol-5D. Psychoactive medication use (range 0-5 per measurement) and sick 
leave were registered. Costs included medication, time spent on challenging 
behaviour and education. Costs and effects were analysed using linear multilevel 
regression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Statistical 
uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Seventeen dementia special care units participated. GRIP led to 
improvement on the QUALIDEM subscale social relations (1.6; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.4) 
and on the use of psychoactive medication (-0.73; 95% CI -1.1 to -0.46) and to a 
decrease in QALYs (-0.02; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.003). No significant effects on 
CMAI, sick leave and other QUALIDEM subscales were found. The intervention was 
not cost-effective in comparison with usual care with regard to CMAI score, 
QALYs and sick leave. The willingness to pay should be 320€/point improvement on 
the QUALIDEM subscale social relations and 370€/psychoactive medication less to 
reach a 0.95 probability of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: It depends on how much society is willing to pay whether GRIP can be 
considered cost-effective. Because the appropriateness of the current methods 
for analysing cost-effectiveness in this specific population is uncertain, the 
positive effects on behaviour, medication and job satisfactions should also be 
taken in account in the decision making.

Evolutionary Consequences of Male Driven Sexual Selection and Sex-Biased Fitness 
Modifications in Drosophila melanogaster and Members of the simulans Clade.

Males have evolved a variety of behavioral, morphological, and physiological 
traits to manipulate their mates in order to maximize their chances of success. 
These traits are bound to influence how females respond to male behaviors and 
influence the nature of sexual selection/conflict. A common consequence of 
aggressive male mating strategies in Drosophila melanogaster is the reduction of 
female lifespan. Our study shows that this is common across members of the 
simulans clade. Reduced life expectancy of females implies that female 
contribution to a population is less than that of males per generation. Fitness 
differences between the sexes in every generation will invariably affect overall 
population fitness. How natural selection responds to the female deaths and 
thereby the unequal fitness of the sexes has rarely been addressed. We shed 
light on this issue and provide evidence, which suggests that additional gains 
of fitness by males due to their longevity and continued mating may provide one 
explanation as to why the loss of female fitness may be "invisible" (effectively 
neutral) to natural selection. Male driven sexual selection and additional, 
transgenerational gains of male fitness can be an important force of 
evolutionary change and need to be tested with other organisms.

Singapore is in the midst of several healthcare reforms in efforts to finance 
and deliver health services for a rapidly aging population. The primary focus of 
these reforms is to make healthcare services, including those at the end of life 
(EOL), affordable. Given the increasingly high health care costs at the EOL, 
policy makers need to consider how best to allocate resources. One strategy is 
to allocate resources based on the preferences of sub-populations most likely to 
be affected. This paper thus aims to quantify preferences for EOL care both 
among community dwelling older adults (CDOAs) and among patients with a 
life-limiting illness. A discrete choice experiment was administered to CDOAs 
and advanced cancer patients in Singapore and willingness to pay (WTP) for 
specific EOL improvements was estimated. We find that patients have a higher WTP 
for nearly all EOL attributes compared with CDOAs. We also show that, for both 
groups, moderate life extension is not the most important consideration; WTP for 
one additional life year is lower than common thresholds for cost-effectiveness. 
Irrespective of whose preference are considered, the results highlight the 
importance of pain management and supporting home deaths at the EOL, perhaps at 
the expense of public funding for costly but only marginally effective 
treatments.

BACKGROUND: Improved medical care over more than five decades has markedly 
increased life expectancy, from 12 years to approximately 60 years, in people 
with Down syndrome (DS). With increased survival into late adulthood, there is 
now a greater need for the medical care of people with DS to prevent and treat 
aging-related disorders. In the wider population, acquired cardiovascular 
diseases such as stroke and coronary heart disease are common with increasing 
age, but the risks of these diseases in people with DS are unknown. There are no 
population-level data on the incidence of acquired major cerebrovascular and 
coronary diseases in DS, and no data examining how cardiovascular comorbidities 
or risk factors in DS might impact on cardiovascular event incidence. Such data 
would be also valuable to inform health care planning for people with DS. Our 
objective was therefore to conduct a population-level matched cohort study to 
quantify the risk of incident major cardiovascular events in DS.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-level matched cohort study compared the risk 
of incident cardiovascular events between hospitalized patients with and without 
DS, adjusting for sex, and vascular risk factors. The sample was derived from 
hospitalization data within the Australian state of Victoria from 1993-2010. For 
each DS admission, 4 exact age-matched non-DS admissions were randomly selected 
from all hospitalizations within a week of the relevant DS admission to form the 
comparison cohort. There were 4,081 people with DS and 16,324 without DS, with a 
total of 212,539 person-years of observation. Compared to the group without DS, 
there was a higher prevalence in the DS group of congenital heart disease, 
cardiac arrhythmia, dementia, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes and sleep apnea, 
and a lower prevalence of ever-smoking. DS was associated with a greater risk of 
incident cerebrovascular events (Risk Ratio, RR 2.70, 95% CI 2.08, 3.53) 
especially among females (RR 3.31, 95% CI 2.21, 4.94) and patients aged ≤ 50 
years old. The association of DS with ischemic strokes was substantially 
attenuated on adjustment for cardioembolic risk (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.04, 3.20), 
but unaffected by adjustment for atherosclerotic risk. DS was associated with a 
40-70% reduced risk of any coronary event in males (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40, 0.84) 
but not in females (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.73, 1.77).
CONCLUSIONS: DS is associated with a high risk of stroke, expressed across all 
ages. Ischemic stroke risk in DS appears mostly driven by cardioembolic risk. 
The greater risk of hemorrhagic stroke and lower risk of coronary events (in 
males) in DS remain unexplained.

This is the first study to our knowledge to examine the relationship between 
happiness and longevity among a nationally representative sample of adults. We 
use the recently-released General Social Survey-National Death Index dataset and 
Cox proportional hazards models to reveal that overall happiness is related to 
longer lives among U.S. adults. Indeed, compared to very happy people, the risk 
of death over the follow-up period is 6% (95% CI 1.01-1.11) higher among 
individuals who are pretty happy and 14% (95% CI 1.06-1.22) higher among those 
who are not happy, net of marital status, socioeconomic status, census division, 
and religious attendance. This study provides support for happiness as a 
stand-alone indicator of well-being that should be used more widely in social 
science and health research.

Men have not been the focus of health monitoring and reporting in 
German-speaking Switzerland so far and are a largely neglected target group of 
governmental preventive efforts. Without good reason. Men have a substantial 
preventive potential regarding health, health behavior and use of health and 
medical services, as can be seen in the recently published global health report 
of the Canton Zurich. Men have a shorter life expectancy compared to women and a 
significantly higher mortality with regard to strongly behavior-related chronic 
diseases as well as fatal traffic accidents and suicides. Men also show 
comparably unfavourable health behavior and a reduced utilization of health 
services. The stronger, but also less healthy and less healthy behaving sex 
should increasingly be the focus of health reporting and health monitoring in 
the future.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of HIV in men who have sex with men 
(MSM) in Bangkok, little investment in HIV prevention for MSM has been made. HIV 
testing and treatment coverage remains low. Through a pragmatic 
programme-planning approach, we assess possible service linkage and provision of 
HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment (ART) to MSM in Bangkok, and the most 
cost-effective scale-up strategy.
METHODS: We obtained epidemiological and service capacity data from the Thai 
National Health Security Office database for 2011. We surveyed 13 representative 
medical facilities for detailed operational costs of HIV-related services for 
sexually active MSM (defined as having sex with men in the past 12 months) in 
metropolitan Bangkok. We estimated the costs of various ART scale-up scenarios, 
accounting for geographical accessibility across Bangkok. We used an HIV 
transmission population-based model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 
scenarios.
FINDINGS: For present HIV testing (23% [95% CI 17-36] of MSM at high risk in 
2011) and ART provision (20% of treatment-eligible MSM at high risk on ART in 
2011) to be sustained, a US$73·8 million ($51·0 million to $97·0 million) 
investment during the next decade would be needed, which would link an extra 
43,000 (27,900-58,000) MSM at high risk to HIV testing and 5100 (3500-6700) to 
ART, achieving an ART coverage of 44% for MSM at high risk in 2022. An 
additional $55·3 million investment would link an extra 46,700 (30,300-63,200) 
MSM to HIV testing and 12,600 (8800-16,600) to ART, achieving universal ART 
coverage of this population by 2022. This increased investment is achievable 
within present infrastructure capacity. Consequently, an estimated 5100 
(3600-6700) HIV-related deaths and 3700 (2600-4900) new infections could be 
averted in MSM by 2022, corresponding to a 53% reduction in deaths and a 35% 
reduction in infections from 2012 levels. The expansion would cost an estimated 
$10,809 (9071-13,274) for each HIV-related death, $14,783 (12,389-17,960) per 
new infection averted, and $351 (290-424) per disability-adjusted life-year 
averted.
INTERPRETATION: Spare capacity in Bangkok's medical facilities can be used to 
expand ART access for MSM with large epidemiological benefits. The expansion 
needs increased funding directed to MSM services, but given the epidemiological 
trends, is probably cost effective. Our modelling approach and outcomes are 
likely to be applicable to other settings.

BACKGROUND: Health extension workers (HEWs) in Ethiopia have a unique position, 
connecting communities to the health sector. This intermediary position requires 
strong interpersonal relationships with actors in both the community and health 
sector, in order to enhance HEW performance. This study aimed to understand how 
relationships between HEWs, the community and health sector were shaped, in 
order to inform policy on optimizing HEW performance in providing maternal 
health services.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in six districts in the Sidama zone, 
which included focus group discussions (FGDs) with HEWs, women and men from the 
community and semi-structured interviews with HEWs; key informants working in 
programme management, health service delivery and supervision of HEWs; mothers; 
and traditional birth attendants. Respondents were asked about facilitators and 
barriers regarding HEWs' relationships with the community and health sector. 
Interviews and FGDs were recorded, transcribed, translated, coded and 
thematically analysed.
RESULTS: HEWs were selected by their communities, which enhanced trust and 
engagement between them. Relationships were facilitated by programme design 
elements related to support, referral, supervision, training, monitoring and 
accountability. Trust, communication and dialogue and expectations influenced 
the strength of relationships. From the community side, the health development 
army supported HEWs in liaising with community members. From the health sector 
side, top-down supervision and inadequate training possibilities hampered 
relationships and demotivated HEWs. Health professionals, administrators, HEWs 
and communities occasionally met to monitor HEW and programme performance. 
Expectations from the community and health sector regarding HEWs' tasks 
sometimes differed, negatively affecting motivation and satisfaction of HEWs.
CONCLUSION: HEWs' relationships with the community and health sector can be 
constrained as a result of inadequate support systems, lack of trust, 
communication and dialogue and differing expectations. Clearly defined roles at 
all levels and standardized support, monitoring and accountability, referral, 
supervision and training, which are executed regularly with clear communication 
lines, could improve dialogue and trust between HEWs and actors from the 
community and health sector. This is important to increase HEW performance and 
maximize the value of HEWs' unique position.

A large number of calmodulin-like (CML) proteins are present in plants, but 
there is little detailed information on the functions of these proteins in rice 
(Oryza sativa L.). Here, the CML3 protein from rice (OsCML3) and its truncated 
form lacking the C-terminal extension (OsCML3m) were found to exhibit a 
Ca2+-binding property and subsequent conformational change, but the ability to 
bind the CaM kinase II peptide was only observed for OsCML3m. Changes in their 
secondary structure upon Ca2+-binding measured by circular dichroism revealed 
that OsCML3m had a higher helical content than OsCML3. Moreover, OsCML3 was 
mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the 
nucleus. The rice high mobility group B1 (OsHMGB1) protein was identified as one 
of the putative OsCML3 target proteins. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation 
analysis revealed that OsHMGB1 bound OsCML3, OsCML3m or OsCML3s (cysteine to 
serine mutation at the prenylation site) in the nucleus presumably through the 
methionine and phenylalanine-rich hydrophobic patches, confirming that OsHMGB1 
is a target protein in planta. The effect of OsCML3 or OsCML3m on the 
DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 was measured using an electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay. OsCML3m decreased the level of OsHMGB1 binding to pUC19 
double-stranded DNA whereas OsCML3 did not. Taken together, OsCML3 probably 
provides a mechanism for manipulating the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 in the 
nucleus and its C-terminal extension provides an intracellular Ca2+ regulatory 
switch.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013;(2):CD005375.

BACKGROUND: Scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is 
usually progressive and is treated with surgery. However, it is unclear whether 
the existing evidence is sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support a 
recommendation for spinal surgery for most patients with DMD and scoliosis. This 
is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new 
studies were found for inclusion.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery in 
patients with DMD with scoliosis. We intended to test whether spinal surgery is 
effective in increasing survival and improving respiratory function, quality of 
life, and overall functioning, and whether spinal surgery is associated with 
severe adverse effects.
SEARCH METHODS: On 16 June 2015 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease 
Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus. We also searched ProQuest 
Dissertation and Thesis database (January 1980 to June 2015), the National 
Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Database (6 January 2015), and the WHO 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (17 June 2015), and checked 
references. We imposed no language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include controlled clinical trials using 
random or quasi-random allocation of treatment evaluating all forms of spinal 
surgery for scoliosis in patients with DMD in the review. The control 
interventions would have been no treatment, non-operative treatment, or a 
different form of spinal surgery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures 
expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently 
examined the search results and evaluated the study characteristics against 
inclusion criteria in order to decide which studies to include in the review.
MAIN RESULTS: Of the 49 relevant studies we found, none met the inclusion 
criteria for the review because they were not clinical trials, but prospective 
or retrospective reviews of case series.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since no randomized controlled clinical trials were 
available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with 
DMD, we can make no good evidence-based conclusion to guide clinical practice. 
Patients with scoliosis should be informed as to the uncertainty of benefits and 
potential risks of surgery for scoliosis. Randomized controlled trials are 
needed to investigate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery, in terms of 
quality of life, functional status, respiratory function, and life expectancy.

AIM: The aim of this study is to present a literature review on the effects of 
the ionizing radiation from radiotherapy treatment on dental tissues.
BACKGROUND: Among the effects of increasing global life expectancy and longevity 
of the teeth in the oral cavity, increasing rates of neoplastic diseases have 
been observed. One of the important treatment modalities for head and neck 
neoplastic diseases is radiotherapy, which uses ionizing radiation as the main 
mechanism of action. Therefore, it is essential for dentists to be aware of the 
changes in oral and dental tissues caused by ionizing radiation, and to develop 
treatment and prevention strategies.
RESULTS: In general, there is still controversy about the effects of ionizing 
radiation on dental structures. However, qualitative and quantitative changes in 
saliva and oral microbiota, presence of oral mucositis and radiation-related 
caries are expected, as they represent the well-known side effects of treatment 
with ionizing radiation. Points that still remain unclear are the effects of 
radiotherapy on enamel and dentin, and on their mechanisms of bonding to 
contemporary adhesive materials.
CONCLUSION: Ionizing radiation has shown important interaction with organic 
tissues, since more deleterious effects have been shown on the oral mucosa, 
salivary glands and dentin, than on enamel.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: With the increasing number of patients with cancer 
seeking dental treatment before and after head and neck radiotherapy, it is 
important for dentists to be aware of the effects of ionizing radiation on the 
oral cavity.

BACKGROUND: Widespread HIV screening and access to highly active antiretroviral 
treatment (ART) were cost effective in mathematical models, but population-level 
implementation has led to questions about cost, value, and feasibility. In 1996, 
British Columbia, Canada, introduced universal coverage of drug and other 
health-care costs for people with HIV/AIDS and and began extensive scale-up in 
access to ART. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ART scale-up in 
British Columbia compared with hypothetical scenarios of constrained treatment 
access.
METHODS: Using comprehensive linked population-level data, we populated a 
dynamic, compartmental transmission model to simulate the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 
British Columbia from 1997 to 2010. We estimated HIV incidence, prevalence, 
mortality, costs (in 2010 CAN$), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the 
study period, which was 1997-2010. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios from societal and third-party-payer perspectives to compare actual 
practice (true numbers of individuals accessing ART) to scenarios of constrained 
expansion (75% and 50% probability of accessing ART). We also investigated 
structural and parameter uncertainty.
FINDINGS: Actual practice resulted in 263 averted incident cases compared with 
75% of observed access and 676 averted cases compared with 50% of observed 
access to ART. From a third-party-payer perspective, actual practice resulted in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $23 679 per QALY versus 75% access and 
$24 250 per QALY versus 50% access. From a societal perspective, actual practice 
was cost saving within the study period. When the model was extended to 2035,
