Understanding biological systems in terms of scientific materialism has arguably 
reached a frontier, leaving fundamental questions about their complexity 
unanswered. In 1998, Friedrich Cramer proposed a general resonance theory as a 
way forward. His theory builds on the extension of the quantum physical duality 
of matter and wave to the macroscopic world. According to Cramer' theory, agents 
constituting biological systems oscillate, akin to musical soundwaves, at 
specific eigenfrequencies. Biological system dynamics can be described as 
"Symphonies of Life" emerging from the resonance (and dissonance) of 
eigenfrequencies within the interacting collective. His theory has potential for 
studying biological problems of increasing complexity in a fast-changing 
Anthropocene from a new and transdisciplinary angle. Despite data becoming 
increasingly available for analyses, Cramer's theory remains ignored and 
therefore untested a quarter century after its publication. This paper discusses 
how the theory can move to quantitative assessments and application. Cramer's 
general resonance theory deserves revival.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a significant 
health threat worldwide. The growing trend towards an aging population, along 
with an alarming rise in obesity and diabetes, may have significant implications 
for the burden of NAFLD.
AIM: To assess the impact of NAFLD on the elderly.
METHODS: We utilised data from the Global Burden of Disease study between 2010 
and 2019 to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with NAFLD in the elderly 
(65-89 years), stratified by region, nation, sociodemographic Index and sex.
RESULTS: Globally, there were an estimated 228 million cases, 87,230 deaths and 
1.46 million DALYs attributed to NAFLD in the elderly. Geographically, the 
Western Pacific region had the highest burden of NAFLD in the elderly. From 2010 
to 2019, there was an increasing prevalence rate in all areas, with the most 
pronounced change observed in the Western Pacific region (annual percentage 
change (APC) +0.95%, p < 0.001). Over the study period, there was a more rapid 
increase in NAFLD prevalence in men (APC +0.74%, p < 0.001) than in women (APC 
+0.63%, p < 0.001). In most regions, death and DALYs rates have declined, with 
the exception of the Americas, where there was a slight increase (APC +0.25%, 
p = 0.002 and 0.38%, p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Over the past decade, the burden of NAFLD in the elderly has been 
increasing, necessitating immediate and inclusive measures to tackle the rising 
burden.

Women have a stronger immune response and a higher frequency of most autoimmune 
diseases than men. While much of the difference between men and women is due to 
the effect of gonadal hormones, genetic differences play a major role in the 
difference between the immune response and disease frequencies in women and men. 
Here, we focus on the immune differences between the sexes that are not 
downstream of the gonadal hormones. These differences include the gene content 
of the sex chromosomes, the inactivation of chromosome X in women, the 
consequences of non-random X inactivation and escape from inactivation, and the 
states that are uniquely met by the immune system of women-pregnancy, birth, and 
breast feeding. While these female-specific states are temporary and involve 
gonadal hormonal changes, they may leave a long-lasting footprint on the health 
of women, for example, by fetal cells that remain in the mother's body for 
decades. We also briefly discuss the immune phenotype of congenital sex 
chromosomal aberrations and experimental models that enable hormonal and the 
non-hormonal effects of the sex chromosomes to be disentangled. The increasing 
human life expectancy lengthens the period during which gonadal hormones levels 
are reduced in both sexes. A better understanding of the non-hormonal effects of 
sex chromosomes thus becomes more important for improving the life quality 
during that period.

As no existing methods within the single-cell RNA sequencing repertoire combine 
genotyping of specific genomic loci with high throughput, we evaluated a 
straightforward, targeted sequencing approach as an extension to high-throughput 
droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing. Overlaying standard gene expression 
data with transcript level genotype information provides a strategy to study the 
impact of genetic variants. Here, we describe this targeted sequencing 
extension, explain how to process the data and evaluate how technical parameters 
such as amount of input cDNA, number of amplification rounds, and sequencing 
depth influence the number of transcripts detected. Finally, we demonstrate how 
targeted sequencing can be used in two contexts: (1) simultaneous investigation 
of the presence of a somatic variant and its potential impact on the 
transcriptome of affected cells and (2) evaluation of allele-specific expression 
of a germline variant in ad hoc cell subsets. Through these and other comparable 
applications, our targeted sequencing extension has the potential to improve our 
understanding of functional effects caused by genetic variation.

Gynecologic cancers, comprising 14.4% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in women 
globally, are substantial causes of both mortality and morbidity, with a 
profound impact on the quality of life (QoL) of survivors. Over the past few 
decades, advancements in interdisciplinary and interprofessional care have 
contributed to an increase in the average life expectancy of gynecological 
cancer patients. However, the disease and its treatments have a profound impact 
on patients, leading to physical changes and psychological consequences, 
including psychosocial and psychosexual effects, which negatively affect their 
QoL.The primary objective of management strategies is to minimize harm while 
improving survival rates and enhancing QoL during the survivorship stage. QoL 
measures play a crucial role in enhancing our comprehension of how cancer and 
its treatments affect individuals. Consequently, various measurement 
instruments, such as the EORTC QLQ 30, PROMIS-29, FACT-G, and QOL-CS, have been 
developed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Pre- and 
post-treatment HRQoL measurements have been shown to be predictive factors for 
post-operative complications and prognostic factors for overall survival and 
progression-free survival in gynecological oncology patients. Patient-reported 
outcomes related to HRQoL are essential tools for measuring patient outcomes and 
enabling patient-centered clinical decision-making.This article focuses on 
HRQoL, providing a historical context, summarizing measurement instruments, and 
discussing the current understanding of the impact of gynecological cancers on 
HRQoL.

Age is a major risk factor for sporadic colon cancer (CC). In the general 
population, the side of the tumor (right versus left) shows a possible 
significant prognostic effect, with right tumors displaying the worst outcome 
due to biological differences. However, little is known about the role of 
sidedness in the older population. We conducted a pooled analysis of 
observational and prospective studies to confirm or reject the hypothesis that 
side is a prognostic variable, even in older patients with CC. Using the terms 
("colorectal" or "colon") and ("cancer" or "carcinoma") and ("elderly" or 
"older" or "65 years" or "70 years" or "75 years") and ("side" or "site" or 
"right" or "left"), we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through 
January 2023. We selected studies in the English language to compare the 
prognosis of left versus right CC in older patients (with a lower age limit of 
65 years). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Hazard ratios (HRs) 
for OS with relative 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from each 
study. Summary HRs were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models, 
depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies. The review process led 
to the inclusion of 13 articles. The studies reported the OS data for a total of 
227,218 patients with CC. The CC side was not independently associated with 
mortality risk in older CC patients (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.9-1.04; p = 0.34). High 
heterogeneity was observed in the main analysis (P < 0.01; I2 = 85%). In 
conclusion, our analysis shows that the tumor being on the left or right side in 
older patients with CC has no significant role in the risk of overall death. 
These data support the use of other parameters, such as stage, biology, 
comorbidities, and life expectancy, to decide on treatment and the prolongation 
of screenings until a patient's latest years.

Growing aging populations pose a threat to global health because of the social 
and psychological challenges they experience. To mitigate this, many countries 
promote hobby engagement to support and improve mental health. Yet, it remains 
unclear whether there is consistency in benefits across different national 
settings. We harmonized measures of hobby engagement and multiple aspects of 
mental wellbeing across 16 nations represented in five longitudinal studies 
(N = 93,263). Prevalence of hobby engagement varied substantially across 
countries, from 51.0% of Spanish respondents to 96.0% of Danish respondents. 
Fixed effects models and multinational meta-analyses were applied to compare the 
longitudinal associations between hobbies and mental wellbeing. Independent of 
confounders, having a hobby was associated with fewer depressive symptoms 
(pooled coefficient = -0.10; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = -0.13, -0.07), and 
higher levels of self-reported health (pooled coefficient = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.03, 
0.08), happiness (pooled coefficient = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.06, 0.13) and life 
satisfaction (pooled coefficient = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.12). Further analyses 
suggested a temporal relationship. The strength of these associations, and 
prevalence of hobby engagement, were correlated with macrolevel factors such as 
life expectancy and national happiness levels but overall, little variance in 
findings was explained by country-level factors (<9%). Given the relative 
universality of findings, ensuring equality in hobby engagement within and 
between countries should be a priority for promoting healthy aging.

The eINTACT method for studying nuclear changes in host plant cells targeted by 
bacterial effectors in native infection contexts.

Type-III effector proteins are major virulence determinants that most 
gram-negative bacteria inject into host cells to manipulate cellular processes 
for infection. Because effector-targeted cells are embedded and underrepresented 
in infected plant tissues, it is technically challenging to isolate them for 
focused studies of effector-induced cellular changes. This protocol describes a 
novel technique, effector-inducible isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell 
types (eINTACT), for isolating biotin-labeled nuclei from Arabidopsis plant 
cells that have received Xanthomonas bacterial effectors by using 
streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. This protocol is an extension of the 
existing Nature Protocols Protocol of the INTACT method for the affinity-based 
purification of nuclei of specific cell types in the context of developmental 
biology. In a phytopathology scenario, our protocol addresses how to obtain 
eINTACT transgenic lines and compatible bacterial mutants, verify the eINTACT 
system and purify nuclei of bacterial effector-recipient cells from infected 
tissues. Differential analyses of purified nuclei from plants infected by 
bacteria expressing the effector of interest and those from plants infected by 
effector-deletion bacterial mutants will reveal the effector-dependent nuclear 
changes in targeted host cells. Provided that the eINTACT system is available, 
the infection experiment takes 5 d, and the procedures, from collecting 
bacteria-infected leaves to obtaining nuclei of effector-targeted cells, can be 
completed in 4 h. eINTACT is a unique method for isolating high-quality nuclei 
from bacterial effector-targeted host cells in native infection contexts. This 
method is adaptable to study the functions of type-III effectors from numerous 
gram-negative bacteria in host plants that are amenable to transformation.

To make informed COVID-19 related decisions, individuals need information about 
their personal risks and how those risks may vary with specific demographic and 
health characteristics. The Fight COVID Milwaukee web-based risk assessment tool 
allows for assessment of COVID-19 mortality risk as a function of personal and 
neighborhood characteristics. The purpose of this study is to explore public 
understanding of this risk assessment tool and risk perception through community 
focus groups. Individuals were recruited from the general adult population in 
Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, USA, to participate in nine online focus groups 
where the risk assessment tool was presented for feedback. Three main themes 
were identified in the focus groups regarding the web-based risk assessment 
tool: some challenges in accessibility, variable ease of understanding, and 
personal usefulness but uncertain value for others. This paper explores how 
members of the community interpret individual risk assessments and life 
expectancy estimations, and how these vary with age, gender, race/ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, and pre-existing comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory illness that 
mostly affects the joints of the hands and feet and can reduce life expectancy 
by an average of 3 to 10 years. Although tremendous progress has been achieved 
in the treatment of RA, a large minority of patients continue to respond poorly 
to existing medications, owing in part to a lack of appropriate therapeutic 
targets.
METHODS: To find therapeutic targets for RA, a Mendelian randomization (MR) was 
performed. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL, exposure) data were 
obtained from the eQTLGen Consortium (sample size 31,684). Summary statistics 
for RA (outcome) were obtained from two largest independent cohorts: sample 
sizes of 97,173 (22,350 cases and 74,823 controls) and 269,377 (8279 cases and 
261,098), respectively. Colocalisation analysis was used to test whether RA risk 
and gene expression were driven by common SNPs. Drug prediction and molecular 
docking was further used to validate the medicinal value of drug targets.
RESULTS: Seven drug targets were significant in both cohorts in MR analysis and 
supported by localization. PheWAS at the gene level showed only ATP2A1 
associated with other traits. These genes are strongly associated with immune 
function in terms of biological significance. Molecular docking showed excellent 
binding for drugs and proteins with available structural data.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies seven potential drug targets for RA. Drugs 
designed to target these genes have a higher chance of success in clinical 
trials and is expected to help prioritise RA drug development and save on drug 
development costs.

AIMS: The aim of this umbrella review was to identify tools and guidelines to 
aid the deprescribing process of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), 
evaluate development and validation methods, and describe evidence levels for 
medication inclusion.
METHODS: Searches were conducted on MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase.com, Cochrane CDSR, 
CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science Core Collection and guideline databases from the 
date of inception to 7 July 2022. Following the initial search, an additional 
search was conducted to identify an updated versions of tools on 17 July 2023. 
We analysed the contents of tools and guidelines.
RESULTS: From 23 systematic reviews and guidelines, we identified 95 tools (72 
explicit, 12 mixed and 11 implicit) and nine guidelines. Most tools (83.2%) were 
developed to use for older persons, including 14 for those with limited life 
expectancy. Seven tools were for children <18 years (7.37%). Most explicit/mixed 
tools (78.57%) and all guidelines were validated. We found 484 PIMs and 202 
medications with different appropriateness independent of disease for older 
persons with normal and limited life expectancy, respectively. Only two tools 
and eight guidelines reported the evidence level, and a quarter of medications 
had high-quality evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Tools are available for a diversity of populations. There were 
discrepancies, with the same medication being classified as inappropriate in 
some tools and appropriate in others, possibly due to low-quality evidence. In 
particular, tools for patients with limited life expectancy were developed based 
on very limited evidence, and research to generate this evidence is urgently 
needed. Our medication lists, along with the level of evidence, could facilitate 
efforts to strengthen the evidence.

Life expectancy has increased considerably in the last decades, clearing the way 
for preventive medicine. The ingestion of healthy foods or ingredients to 
improve health is gaining attention and edible flowers entail a promising source 
of bioactive compounds. The aim of this work was to study the anti-ageing and 
anti-obesity properties of an extract obtained from an edible flower Viola x 
wittrockiana though in vitro and in vivo methodologies with Caenorhabditis 
elegans as a model. The capacity to inhibit the enzymes α-glucosidase and lipase 
as well as to prevent advance glycation end-product (AGE) formation was tested 
in vitro. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as an obesity in vivo model to assess 
the effects of the extract on fat accumulation, development, progeny and health 
span. Viola flowers showed lower IC50 values in the α-glucosidase assay than the 
reference drug acarbose and exerted a higher inhibition of AGE formation than 
the reference substance aminoguanidine; the extract also showed pancreatic 
lipase inhibiting properties. Moreover, the extract lowered fat storage of C. 
elegans in a dose-dependent manner, up to 90.37% at the highest tested dose, and 
improved health span biomarkers such as lipofuscin accumulation and progeny 
availability. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the anti-obesogenic 
and anti-ageing activity of Viola x wittrockiana flowers and their potential use 
as functional foods and nutraceuticals.

From Pleasure to Pathology: Understanding the Neural Basis of Food Addiction in 
the Context of Obesity.

Soroceanu RP, Soroceanu A, Timofte DV, Timofeiov S, Tanase AE, Iordache A, 
Ambrosie L, Miler AA, Azoicai D.

As rates of severe obesity continue to rise globally, intense efforts are 
required both from the scientific community, physicians and health policy makers 
to better understand the mechanisms, prevent and treat obesity in order to stop 
the upcoming pandemic. Obesity is known to significantly reduce life expectancy 
and overall quality of life, thus becoming a leading cause of preventable 
deaths. This article focuses on the relationship between obesity and food 
addiction, the main neural mechanisms, brain regions, genes, hormones and 
neurotransmitters involved and on the similarities between food addiction and 
substance abuse. The definition of obesity is based on the body mass index 
(BMI). A BMI of 30 or higher is classified as obese. Obesity is not solely a 
result of overeating, but has multifactorial causes, thus, prevention being 
extremely difficult. The concept of food addiction implies extreme cravings, 
lack of self-control, and overeating, especially involving tasty foods. The 
addiction concept is supported both by clinicalbehavioural research and 
neurobiological research. These studies demonstrate similarities between binge 
eating and drug addiction, including cravings, loss of control, excessive 
intake, tolerance, withdrawal, and distress/dysfunction. Although generally food 
addiction is thought to be distinct from obesity, most studies identify that a 
significant percentage of individuals with food addiction are obese. Our aim was 
to emphasize the need to better understand the neurological basis of obesity and 
addiction, and its implications for research, treatment, and public health 
initiatives. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying food addiction can 
inform future healthcare policies and interventions aimed at addressing the 
global obesity epidemic.

Disease, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Peking Union Medical 
College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100037, China.

BACKGROUND: Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) poses a public health challenge, 
but data on its burden and trends among older adults are scarce. This study 
aimed to identify trends in the burden of HHD among older adults between 1990 
and 2019 at the global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Diseases study 2019 data, we assessed HHD 
prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates for 
individuals aged 60-89 years at the global, regional, and national levels and 
estimated their average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) between 1990 and 2019 
using joinpoint regression analysis.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 14.35 million HHD prevalent cases, 0.85 million 
deaths, and 14.56 million DALYs in older adults. Between 1990 and 2019, the 
prevalence of HHD increased globally {AAPC, 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.36, 0.41)} with decreases observed in mortality (AAPC, -0.83 [95% CI, -0.99, 
-0.66]) and the DALY rate (AAPC, -1.03 [95% CI, -1.19, -0.87]). This overall 
global trend pattern was essentially maintained for sex, age group, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI) quintile except for non-significant changes in the 
prevalence of HHD in those aged 70-74 years and in the middle SDI quintile. 
Notably, males had a higher HHD prevalence rate. However, HHD-related mortality 
and the DALY rate were higher in females. The middle SDI quintile experienced 
the largest decreases in mortality and the DALY rate, with a non-significant 
decline in prevalence between 1990 and 2019. There were significant 
discrepancies in the HHD burden and its trends across regions and countries.
CONCLUSIONS: In the past three decades, there has been an overall increasing 
trend in the prevalence of HHD among older adults worldwide despite decreasing 
trends in mortality and the DALY rate. Better management of hypertension, and 
prevention and control of HHD are needed in older adults.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, health insurance coverage and quality mediate 
access to health care, a key social determinant of health.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a scoping review regarding the impact of insurance 
coverage and benefit design on health care access and both clinical and quality 
of life outcomes in people with MS (pwMS).
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. A 
literature search was conducted from January 2010 to February 2022. Included 
studies were in English, peer-reviewed, US-based, and evaluated elements of 
insurance and their relationship with access and quality outcomes for adult 
pwMS.
RESULTS: Our search identified 1619 articles, of which 32 met inclusion 
criteria. Privately insured pwMS were more likely to be on disease-modifying 
therapy (DMT). Increased out-of-pocket spending was associated with lower DMT 
adherence and greater discontinuation rates. Access to specialty pharmacy 
programs was associated with improved DMT adherence.
CONCLUSION: Health insurance coverage and design strongly influences health care 
for pwMS in the United States and may be a modifiable social determinant of 
health. Increased pharmaceutical cost-sharing is associated with declines in DMT 
utilization and adherence. Further study is needed to better characterize the 
impacts of other core elements of health insurance, including prior 
authorization requirements and step therapy.

IMPORTANCE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the 
colon, with a prevalence exceeding 400 per 100 000 in North America. Individuals 
with UC have a lower life expectancy and are at increased risk for colectomy and 
colorectal cancer.
OBSERVATIONS: UC impairs quality of life secondary to inflammation of the colon 
causing chronic diarrhea and rectal bleeding. Extraintestinal manifestations, 
such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, occur in approximately 27% of patients 
with UC. People with UC require monitoring of symptoms and biomarkers of 
inflammation (eg, fecal calprotectin), and require colonoscopy at 8 years from 
diagnosis for surveillance of dysplasia. Risk stratification by disease location 
(eg, Montreal Classification) and disease activity (eg, Mayo Score) can guide 
management of UC. First-line therapy for induction and maintenance of remission 
of mild to moderate UC is 5-aminosalicylic acid. Moderate to severe UC may 
require oral corticosteroids for induction of remission as a bridge to 
medications that sustain remission (biologic monoclonal antibodies against tumor 
necrosis factor [eg, infliximab], α4β7 integrins [vedolizumab], and interleukin 
[IL] 12 and IL-23 [ustekinumab]) and oral small molecules that inhibit janus 
kinase (eg, tofacitinib) or modulate sphingosine-1-phosphate (ozanimod). Despite 
advances in medical therapies, the highest response to these treatments ranges 
from 30% to 60% in clinical trials. Within 5 years of diagnosis, approximately 
20% of patients with UC are hospitalized and approximately 7% undergo colectomy. 
The risk of colorectal cancer after 20 years of disease duration is 4.5%, and 
people with UC have a 1.7-fold higher risk for colorectal cancer compared with 
the general population. Life expectancy in people with UC is approximately 80.5 
years for females and 76.7 years for males, which is approximately 5 years 
shorter than people without UC.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: UC affects approximately 400 of every 100 000 people 
in North America. An effective treatment for mild to moderate UC is 
5-aminosalicylic acid, whereas moderate to severe UC can be treated with 
advanced therapies that target specific inflammation pathways, including 
monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor, α4β7 integrins, and IL-12 and 
IL-23 cytokines, as well as oral small molecule therapies targeting janus kinase 
or sphingosine-1-phosphate.

BACKGROUND: Electroanatomical mapping (EAM)-guided stereotactic arrhythmia 
radioablation (STAR) is a novel noninvasive therapy option for patients with 
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs 
and/or urgent catheter ablation (CA). Data on success rates in an emergency 
situation such as electrical storm (ES) are rare. We present a case of a patient 
with an initially very poor life expectancy after extensive myocardial 
infarction with therapy-resistant ES, not amendable for further antiarrhythmic 
drug therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, or repeated 
CA who was introduced to the radiation oncology department for emergency STAR as 
a bail-out therapy.
METHODS: Target volume definition and transfer from EAM to CT were validated and 
quality assured with a semi-automatic, dedicated visualization tool (CARDIO-RT). 
Emergency STAR was performed with 25 Gy in the framework of the RAVENTA study. 
The VT burden gradually decreased after STAR; however, a second VT morphology 
occurred, which was successfully treated with EAM-guided CA 12 days after STAR.
RESULTS: The second EAM-guided CA showed areas of low voltage in the irradiated 
segments, indicating a precise targeting and early functional response to STAR. 
The patient remained free of any VT recurrence or any radiation-related 
toxicities and in good general condition during the recent follow-up of 
18 months.
CONCLUSION: The case highlights the possible approach, caveats, difficulties, 
and prognosis of a patient severely affected by therapy-resistant VT in whom CA 
could not lead to VT suppression. Further studies of putative mechanisms of STAR 
in the acute and chronic phase of this novel therapy are warranted.

PURPOSE: Medulloblastoma is one of the brain tumors with increased life 
expectancy due to improvements in treatment approaches. Besides the promising 
results, various undesirable effects can be encountered. This study's aim is to 
review long-term follow-up outcomes of our cases with medulloblastoma.
METHODS: Age at diagnosis, histological type of medulloblastoma, resection 
extension, chemotherapy and radiotherapy schemes, follow-up duration, and 
endocrinological, neuropsychiatric, cardiological, auditory, and visual 
examination results were evaluated in 20 patients diagnosed between 2007 and 
2018 and followed 5 years and more.
RESULTS: Twenty of 53 patients were included to the study. Eleven (55%) were 
male. Mean age at diagnosis was 6.95 years; mean age at the time of the study 
was 14 years. Mean follow-up time was 8.95 years. In terms of surgery, 14 (70%) 
were gross total, 1 (5%) was near total, and 2 (10%) were subtotal resection. In 
histopathological examination, 14 (70%) were classical medulloblastoma, 4 (20%) 
were desmoplastic medulloblastoma, and 1 (5%) was anaplastic medulloblastoma. 
With regard to endocrinological evaluation, 15 (75%) patients had 
hypothyroidism, 5 (25%) had growth hormone deficiency, 7 (35%) had clinical 
growth hormone deficiency, and 5 (25%) had sex hormone disorders. In 
neuropsychiatric examination, 11 (55%) patients had neurological sequelae, 18 
(90%) patients had psychiatric issues, and 14 (70%) patients had two or more 
neuropsychiatric problems simultaneously. One (5%) patient had mitral valve 
insufficiency. Twelve patients (60%) had hearing loss. According to visual 
examination, 6 (30%) patients had refraction problem, 4 (20%) had cataract, and 
1 (5%) had dry eye.
CONCLUSION: Careful monitoring of long-term side effects is important for 
improving the quality of life of medulloblastoma patients. Besides 
endocrinological and other somatic sequelae of the disease and treatment, 
increased neuropsychiatric problems showed us that only cure is not the issue 
while treating childhood medulloblastoma.

Globally, there has been tremendous advancement in medicine and child healthcare 
with increased life expectancy. That notwithstanding, the risk of under-five 
mortality ─ children dying before their fifth birthday remains relatively high 
in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa such as Ghana. In Ghana, under-five mortality 
remains a major public health problem that requires significant policy 
interventions. Using data from the 2017 Maternal Health Survey (n = 4785), we 
examined the geographic disparities in the time to under-five mortality in 
Ghana. The Kaplan Meier estimator showed significant (Log-rank: p< 0.001) 
rural-urban differences in the time to under-five mortality in Ghana. A 
disaggregated cox proportional hazards analysis showed that despite wide 
consensus that children in urban areas have a high survival rate, children in 
urban areas in northern regions of Ghana, especially the Upper West (HR = 4.40, 
p < 0.05) and Upper East (HR = 5.37, p < 0.01) Regions were significantly at 
increased risk of dying before the age of five compared to children in urban 
areas in the Greater Accra Region. A rural-urban comparison showed that children 
born in rural areas in all the other regions of Ghana were at a higher risk of 
dying before the age of five when compared to their counterparts in the rural 
areas of Greater Accra Region. Other factors such as sex of child, mothers' age 
and use of the internet, number of household members, ethnicity and household 
wealth were significantly associated with the timing of under-five mortality in 
Ghana. Healthcare policies and programs such as immunizations and affordable 
child healthcare services should be prioritized especially in rural areas of 
regions with a high risk of child mortality. Also, there is a need to improve 
healthcare delivery in urban areas, particularly in northern Ghana, where 
deplorable healthcare service infrastructure and delivery coupled with high 
poverty rates put children at risk of dying before their fifth birthday.

BACKGROUND: Osteopenia, a condition in which bone mineral density is lower than 
normal, is a noted risk factor that leads to a shortened healthy life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic impact of preoperative osteopenia in 
patients with colorectal cancer.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective study.
SETTING: This study was conducted at a university hospital.
PATIENTS: A total of 1086 patients with stage I to III colorectal cancer who 
underwent curative resection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Osteopenia was evaluated with CT. Overall survival, 
disease-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival were the primary end 
points.
RESULTS: Osteopenia was identified in 300 patients (27.6%). Compared with the no 
osteopenia group, the 5-year overall survival (74.0% vs 93.4%, p < 0.001), 
disease-specific survival (81.6% vs 97.2%, p < 0.001), and recurrence-free 
survival rates (57.1% vs 88.3%, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the
