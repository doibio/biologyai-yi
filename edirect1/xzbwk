probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that diagnosis with SOC was 
cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and 
$100,000. SOC was the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: SOC with biopsy sampling is the most cost-effective diagnostic 
modality for CCA in PSC strictures.

As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) Single 
Technology Appraisal (STA) process, ruxolitinib was assessed to determine the 
clinical and cost effectiveness of its use in the treatment of disease-related 
splenomegaly or symptoms in adults with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib had 
previously been assessed as part of the STA process and was not recommended in 
NICE guidance issued in June 2013 (TA289). A review of TA289 was commissioned 
following the availability of new longer-term survival data; a price discount 
patient access scheme (PAS) was also introduced. The Centre for Reviews and 
Dissemination (CRD) and Centre for Health Economics (CHE) Technology Appraisal 
Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the independent 
Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a summary of the manufacturer 
or sponsor of the technology's (referred to as the company) submission, the ERG 
review and the resulting NICE guidance issued in March 2016. The main clinical 
effectiveness data were derived from two good-quality multicentre randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs): COMFORT-II compared ruxolitinib with best available 
therapy (BAT) and COMFORT-I compared ruxolitinib with placebo. Both RCTs 
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in splenomegaly and its 
associated symptoms in intermediate-2 and high-risk myelofibrosis patients. 
Overall survival was statistically significantly improved with ruxolitinib 
compared with BAT at 3.5 years of follow-up in the COMFORT-II trial (hazard 
ratio 0.58, 95 % CI 0.36-0.93). Grade 3-4 adverse events were more frequent in 
the ruxolitinib group than in the BAT group; 42 % compared with 25 %. Evidence 
relating to patients with lower-risk disease or low platelet counts 
(50-100 × 109/L) was less robust. The company's economic model was 
well-presented and had an appropriate model structure. The base-case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be around £45,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (including the PAS discount). Extensive 
sensitivity and scenario analyses were presented, demonstrating that the 
estimated ICER was robust to a range of input values and assumptions made in the 
model. Alternative scenarios presented by the ERG showed only modest increases 
in the estimated ICER, primarily as a result of including an element of drug 
wastage within the model. Alternative scenarios resulted in estimated ICERs 
ranging from around £45,000 to £49,000 per QALY gained (including the PAS 
discount). At the first appraisal meeting, the NICE Appraisal Committee 
concluded that ruxolitinib was clinically effective and was a cost effective use 
of National Health Service (NHS) resources for patients with high-risk 
myelofibrosis who meet NICE's end-of-life criteria. Following the consultation, 
the company offered a revised PAS, resulting in a revised base-case ICER of 
£31,229 per QALY gained. The company also presented new evidence on the cost 
effectiveness of ruxolitinib in intermediate-2 and high-risk subgroups and a 
revised version of the model. The NICE Appraisal Committee considered the new 
evidence and recommended ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with 
intermediate-2-risk disease as well as patients with high-risk disease, based on 
International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) prognostic factors.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly 
prevalent chronic lung disease with considerable clinical and socioeconomic 
impact. Pharmacologic maintenance drugs (such as bronchodilators and inhaled 
corticosteroids) play an important role in the treatment of COPD. The cost 
effectiveness of these treatments has been frequently assessed, but studies to 
date have largely neglected the impact of treatment sequence and the exact stage 
of disease in which the drugs are used in real life.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review recently published articles that 
reported the cost effectiveness of COPD maintenance treatments, with a focus on 
key findings, quality and methodological issues.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in Embase, PubMed, the UK 
NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED) and EURONHEED (European Network of 
Health Economics Evaluation Databases) and included all relevant articles 
published between 2011 and 2015 in either Dutch, English or German. Main study 
characteristics, methods and outcomes were extracted and critically assessed. 
The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument was used as basis for 
quality assessment, but additional items were also addressed.
RESULTS: The search identified 18 recent pharmacoeconomic analyses of COPD 
maintenance treatments. Papers reported the cost effectiveness of long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) monotherapy (n = 6), phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 
inhibitors (n = 4), long-acting beta agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) 
combinations (n = 4), LABA monotherapy (n = 2) and LABA/LAMA combinations 
(n = 2). All but two studies were funded by the manufacturer, and all studies 
indicated favourable cost effectiveness; however, the number of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained was small. Less than half of the studies reported a 
COPD-specific outcome in addition to a generic outcome (mostly QALYs). 
Exacerbation and mortality rates were found to be the main drivers of cost 
effectiveness. According to the QHES, the quality of the studies was generally 
sufficient, but additional assessment revealed that most studies poorly 
represented the cost effectiveness of real-life medication use.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of studies showed that pharmacologic COPD maintenance 
treatment is cost effective, but most studies poorly reflected real-life drug 
use. Consistent and COPD-specific methodology is recommended.

AIM: The main aim of this study is to demonstrate how our melanoma disease model 
(MDM) can be used for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in the melanoma 
detection field. In particular, we used the data of two cohorts of Belgian 
melanoma patients to investigate the cost-effectiveness of dermoscopy.
METHODS: A MDM, previously constructed to calculate the melanoma burden, was 
slightly modified to be suitable for CEAs. Two cohorts of patients entered into 
the model to calculate morbidity, mortality and costs. These cohorts were 
constituted by melanoma patients diagnosed by dermatologists adequately, or not 
adequately, trained in dermoscopy. Effectiveness and costs were calculated for 
each cohort and compared. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), a composite measure depending on melanoma-related morbidity and 
mortality. Costs included costs of treatment and follow-up as well as costs of 
detection in non-melanoma patients and costs of excision and pathology of benign 
lesions excised to rule out melanoma.
RESULTS: The result of our analysis concluded that melanoma diagnosis by 
dermatologists adequately trained in dermoscopy resulted in both a gain of QALYs 
(less morbidity and/or mortality) and a reduction in costs.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates how our MDM can be used in CEAs in the 
melanoma detection field. The model and the methodology suggested in this paper 
were applied to two cohorts of Belgian melanoma patients. Their analysis 
concluded that adequate dermoscopy training is cost-effective. The results 
should be confirmed by a large-scale randomised study.

Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is associated with increased oxidative 
stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Current evidence suggests a protective 
role of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. 
However, it is unknown yet a putative role of Trx1 in sepsis-induced myocardial 
dysfunction, in which oxidative stress is an underlying cause. Transgenic male 
mice with Trx1 cardiac-specific overexpression (Trx1-Tg) and its wild-type 
control (wt) were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture or sham surgery. 
After 6, 18, and 24h, cardiac contractility, antioxidant enzymes, protein 
oxidation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Trx1 overexpression 
improved the average life expectancy (Trx1-Tg: 36, wt: 28h; p=0.0204). Sepsis 
induced a decrease in left ventricular developed pressure in both groups, while 
the contractile reserve, estimated as the response to β-adrenergic stimulus, was 
higher in Trx1-Tg in relation to wt, after 6h of the procedure. Trx1 
overexpression attenuated complex I inhibition, protein carbonylation, and loss 
of membrane potential, and preserved Mn superoxide dismutase activity at 24h. 
Ultrastructural alterations in mitochondrial cristae were accompanied by reduced 
optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) fusion protein, and activation of dynamin-related protein 
1 (Drp1) (fission protein) in wt mice at 24h, suggesting mitochondrial 
fusion/fission imbalance. PGC-1α gene expression showed a 2.5-fold increase in 
Trx1-Tg at 24h, suggesting mitochondrial biogenesis induction. Autophagy, 
demonstrated by electron microscopy and increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, was 
observed earlier in Trx1-Tg. In conclusion, Trx1 overexpression extends 
antioxidant protection, attenuates mitochondrial damage, and activates 
mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy and biogenesis), preserves contractile reserve 
and prolongs survival during sepsis.

As life expectancy becomes longer in Japan, there has been an increase of 
elderly patients with type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy but cannot 
perform self-injection due to dementia or other conditions. Therefore, the aim 
of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of thrice-weekly 
insulin degludec therapy in elderly patients with poorly controlled diabetes. 
The subjects were 22 hospitalized elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes 
who had difficulty with self-injection. After becoming stable on once-daily 
insulin degludec treatment, they were assigned to continue once-daily injection 
(OD group) or were switched to thrice-weekly injection (TW group) for one week. 
In the TW group, insulin degludec (IDeg) was injected at twice the OD dose 
before lunch on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Glycemic control was assessed by 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over 7 days. The mean 7-day glucose level 
(131±25 mg/dL with OD vs. 152±30 mg/dL with TW, p=0.11) and the mean 7-day 
standard deviation (32±10 mg/dL with OD vs. 36±14 mg/dL with TW, p=0.45) did not 
differ significantly between the two groups. The percent duration of glucose <70 
mg/dL (2.4±3.1% with OD vs. 1.3±2.5% with TW, p=0.39) and glucose >200 mg/dL 
(7.2±12.1% with OD vs. 15.6±18.0% with TW, p=0.22) over 7 days also showed no 
significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, thrice-weekly 
IDeg provided by a visiting nurse could be a practical option for elderly 
diabetic patients who have difficulty performing self-injection of insulin.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term clinical and economic impact of integrated 
pump/CGM technology therapy as compared to multiple daily injections (MDI), for 
the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Colombia.
METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate a hypothetical cohort of 
patients with T1D. Mean baseline characteristics were taken from a clinical 
study conducted in Colombia and a healthcare payer perspective was adopted, with 
a 5% annual discount rate applied to both costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: The integrated pump/CGM improved mean life expectancy by 3.51 years 
compared with MDI. A similar increase occurred in mean quality-adjusted life 
expectancy with an additional 3.81 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Onset of 
diabetes-related complications was also delayed as compared to MDI, and mean 
survival time free of complication increased by 1.74 years with integrated 
pump/CGM. Although this increased treatment costs of diabetes as compared to 
MDI, savings were achieved thanks to reduced expenditure on diabetes-related 
complications. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for SAP 
was Colombian Pesos (COP) 44,893,950 (approximately USD$23,200) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved blood glucose control associated to integrated pump/CGM 
results in a decreased incidence of diabetes-related complications and improves 
life expectancy as compared to MDI. Using recommended thresholds from the World 
Health Organization and previous coverage decisions about health technologies in 
Colombia, it is a cost-effective alternative to MDI for the treatment of type 1 
diabetes in Colombia.

INTRODUCTION: Improved outcome and longer life-expectancy in patients with 
cystinosis, and disease complexity itself, justify planning a guided-transition 
of affected patients from Pediatrics to adult medicine. The aims of the process 
are to guarantee the continuum of care and patient empowerment, moving from 
guardian-care to self-care.
METHODS: review of articles, expert opinion and anonymous surveys of patients, 
relatives and patient advocacy groups.
RESULTS: elaboration a new document to support and coordinate the transition of 
patients with cystinosis providing specific proposals in a variety of medical 
fields, and adherence promotion. Nephrologists play a key role in transition due 
the fact that most cystinotic patients suffer severe chronic kidney disease, and 
need kidney transplantation before adulthood.
CONCLUSION: we present a document providing recommendations and suggesting a 
chronogram to help the process of transition of adolescents and young adults 
with cystinosis in our area.

BACKGROUND: Response-guided neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RG-NACT) with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is effective in treating oestrogen receptor 
positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative 
(ER-positive/HER2-negative) breast cancer. We estimated the expected 
cost-effectiveness and resources required for its implementation compared to 
conventional-NACT.
METHODS: A Markov model compared costs, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) and 
costs/QALY of RG-NACT vs. conventional-NACT, from a hospital perspective over a 
5-year time horizon. Health services required for and health outcomes of 
implementation were estimated via resource modelling analysis, considering a 
current (4 %) and a full (100 %) implementation scenario.
RESULTS: RG-NACT was expected to be more effective and less costly than 
conventional NACT in both implementation scenarios, with 94 % (current) and 95 % 
(full) certainty, at a willingness to pay threshold of €20.000/QALY. Fully 
implementing RG-NACT in the Dutch target population of 6306 patients requires 
additional 5335 MRI examinations and an (absolute) increase in the number of MRI 
technologists, by 3.6 fte (full-time equivalent), and of breast radiologists, by 
0.4 fte. On the other hand, it prevents 9 additional relapses, 143 cancer 
deaths, 23 congestive heart failure events and 2 myelodysplastic syndrome/acute 
myeloid leukaemia events.
CONCLUSION: Considering cost-effectiveness, RG-NACT is expected to dominate 
conventional-NACT. While personnel capacity is likely to be sufficient for a 
full implementation scenario, MRI utilization needs to be intensified.

Electrospinning technique was used to convert polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) 
sol-gel solution to a new nanostructure on a stainless steel wire. The surface 
morphology of the fiber was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It 
showed a diameter range of 30-60nm for PDMS nanoparticles with a homogeneous and 
porous surface structure. The applicability of this coating was assessed for the 
headspace SPME (HS-SPME) of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) 
from water samples followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The 
important parameters affecting extraction efficiency such as extraction time and 
temperature, desorption conditions, agitation rate and ionic strength were 
investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, LODs and LOQs of 
0.3-5μgL(-1) and 1-10μgL(-1) were obtained, respectively. The method showed 
linearity in the broad range of 1-5000μgL(-1) with correlation coefficient of 
>0.99. Inter-day and intra-day precisions of the developed method ranged from 
2.43% to 6.54% and from 5.24% to 13.73%, respectively. The thermal stability of 
the fiber was investigated on stainless steel wire. It was found to be durable 
at 260°C for more than 360min. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully 
applied for quantification of BTEX in real water samples.

BACKGROUND: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal for health (SDG3) 
poses complex challenges for signatory countries that will require clear 
roadmaps to set priorities over the next 15 years. Building upon the work of the 
Commission on Investing in Health and published estimates of feasible global 
mortality SDG3 targets, we analysed Mexico's mortality to assess the feasibility 
of reducing premature (0-69 years) mortality and propose a path to meet SDG3.
METHODS: We developed a baseline scenario applying 2010 age-specific and 
cause-specific mortality rates from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics 
and Geography (INEGI) to the 2030 UN Population Division (UNPD) population 
projections. In a second scenario, INEGI age-specific and cause-specific trends 
in death rates from 2000 to 2014 were projected to 2030 and adjusted to match 
the UNPD 2030 mortality projections. A third scenario assumed a 40% reduction in 
premature deaths across all ages and causes. By comparing these scenarios we 
quantified shortfalls in mortality reductions by age group and cause, and 
forecasted life expectancy pathways for Mexico to converge to better performing 
countries.
FINDINGS: UNPD-projected death rates yield a 25·9% reduction of premature 
mortality for Mexico. Accelerated reductions in adult mortality are necessary to 
reach a 40% reduction by 2030. Mortality declines aggregated across all age 
groups mask uneven gains across health disorders. Injuries, particularly road 
traffic accidents and homicides, are the main health challenge for young adults 
(aged 20-49 years) whereas unabated diabetes mortality is the single most 
important health concern for older adults (aged 50-69 years).
INTERPRETATION: Urgent action is now required to control non-communicable 
diseases and reduce fatal injuries in Mexico, making a 40% reduction in 
premature mortality by 2030 feasible and putting Mexico back on a track of 
substantial life expectancy convergence with better performing countries. Our 
study provides a roadmap for setting national health priorities. Further 
analysis of the equity implications of following the suggested pathway remains a 
subject of future research.

The quality of clinical biobank samples is crucial to their value for life 
sciences research. A number of factors related to the collection and storage of 
samples may affect the biomolecular composition. We have studied the effect of 
long-time freezer storage, chronological age at sampling, season and month of 
the year and on the abundance levels of 108 proteins in 380 plasma samples 
collected from 106 Swedish women. Storage time affected 18 proteins and 
explained 4.8-34.9% of the observed variance. Chronological age at sample 
collection after adjustment for storage-time affected 70 proteins and explained 
1.1-33.5% of the variance. Seasonal variation had an effect on 15 proteins and 
month (number of sun hours) affected 36 proteins and explained up to 4.5% of the 
variance after adjustment for storage-time and age. The results show that 
freezer storage time and collection date (month and season) exerted similar 
effect sizes as age on the protein abundance levels. This implies that 
information on the sample handling history, in particular storage time, should 
be regarded as equally prominent covariates as age or gender and need to be 
included in epidemiological studies involving protein levels.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate students' health-related 
lifestyles and to identify barriers and social determinants of healthier 
lifestyles.
METHODS: An online survey, two focus groups and three in-depth interviews across 
2014/2015. A stratified by school size and random sample ( n = 468) of 
university students answered a 67-item questionnaire comprising six scales: 
Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity, Rapid Eating and Activity Assessment for 
Patients-Short Version, CAGE, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, 
Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale short version, and ad hoc scale for 
drug use/misuse. Stratified by gender, χ2 tests were run to test 
associations/estimate risks and three multivariate Logistic Regression models 
were adjusted. A thematic approach guided the analysis of qualitative data.
RESULTS: A total of 60% of the respondents were insufficiently physically 
active, 47% had an unbalanced diet and 30% had low mental wellbeing. Alcohol 
drinkers versus abstinent were almost equally distributed. A total of 42% of 
alcohol drinkers reported getting drunk at least once a month. Smokers accounted 
for 16% of the respondents. Identified risk factors for suboptimal physical 
activity were as follows: being a woman, not using the university gym and 
smoking. Risk factors for unbalanced diet were low mental wellbeing and drug 
use. Poor mental wellbeing was predicted by unbalanced diet, not feeling like 
shopping and cooking frequently, and a lack of help-seeking behaviour in cases 
of distress. Qualitative analysis revealed seven thematic categories: transition 
to new life, university environment and systems, finances, academic pressure, 
health promotion on campus and recommendations.
CONCLUSION: This study provides robust evidence that the health-related 
lifestyles of the student population are worrying and suggests that the trend in 
chronic diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles sustained over years might 
be unlikely to change in future generations. University students' health-related 
lifestyle is a concern. Nine out of the identified 10 predictors of problematic 
physical activity, nutrition and mental wellbeing, were environmental/societal 
or institutional barriers. Universities must expand corporate responsibilities 
to include the promotion of health as part of their core values.

Skull base osteomyelitis is classically documented as an extension of malignant 
otitis externa. Initial presentation commonly includes aural symptoms and 
cranial nerve dysfunctions. Here we present a case that emerged with multiple 
infarctions in the right cerebrum. A male in his 70s with diabetes mellitus and 
chronic renal failure presented with left hemiparesis. Imaging studies showed 
that blood flow in the carotid artery remained at the day of onset but was 
totally occluded 7 days later. However, collateral blood supply prevented severe 
infarction. These findings suggest that artery-to-artery embolization from the 
petrous and/or cavernous portion of the carotid artery caused the multiple 
infarctions observed on initial presentation. Osteomyelitis of the central skull 
base was diagnosed on the basis of the following findings taken together: 
laboratory results showing high levels of inflammation, presence of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in the otorrhea and blood culture, multiple cranial nerve palsies 
that appeared later, the bony erosion observed on CT, and the mass lesion on 
MRI. Osteomyelitis was treated successfully by long-term antibiotic therapy; 
however, the patient experienced cefepime-induced neurotoxicity during therapy. 
The potential involvement of the internal carotid artery in this rare and 
life-threatening disease is of particular interest in this case.

OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the long-term efficacious and economic impacts 
of universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS).
DESIGN: An analytical Markov decision model was framed with two screening 
strategies: UNHS with transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) test and 
automatic acoustic brainstem response (aABR) test against no screening. By 
estimating intervention and long-term costs on treatment and productivity losses 
and the utility of life years determined by the status of hearing loss, we 
computed base-case estimates of the incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). The 
scattered plot of ICUR and acceptability curve was used to assess the economic 
results of aABR versus TEOAE or both versus no screening.
STUDY SAMPLE: A hypothetical cohort of 200,000 Taiwanese newborns.
RESULTS: TEOAE and aABR dominated over no screening strategy (ICUR = $-4800.89 
and $-4111.23, indicating less cost and more utility). Given $20,000 of 
willingness to pay (WTP), the probability of being cost-effective of aABR 
against TEOAE was up to 90%.
CONCLUSIONS: UNHS for hearing loss with aABR is the most economic option and 
supported by economically evidence-based evaluation from societal perspective.

AIM: To investigate the effect of combining pain education, specific exercises 
and graded physical activity training (exercise) compared with pain education 
alone (control) on physical health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in chronic 
neck pain patients.
METHODS: A multicentre randomised controlled trial of 200 neck pain patients 
receiving pain education. The exercise group received additional exercises for 
neck/shoulder, balance and oculomotor function, plus graded physical activity 
training. Patient-reported outcome measures (Short Form-36 Physical and Mental 
component summary scores, EuroQol-5D, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Neck 
Disability Index, Pain Bothersomeness, Patient-Specific Functioning Scale, Tampa 
Scale of Kinesiophobia, Global Perceived Effect) and clinical tests (Aastrand 
Physical Fitness, cervical Range of Motion, Pressure Pain Threshold at 
infraspinatus, tibialis anterior and cervical spine, Cranio-cervical Flexion, 
Cervical Extension muscle function, and oculomotion) were recorded at baseline 
and after 4 months.
RESULTS: The exercise group showed statistically significant improvement in 
physical HR-QoL, mental HR-QoL, depression, cervical pressure pain threshold, 
cervical extension movement, muscle function, and oculomotion. Per protocol 
analyses confirmed these results with additional significant improvements in the 
exercise group compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This multimodal intervention may be an effective intervention for 
chronic neck pain patients.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on 
www.ClinicalTrials.govNCT01431261 and at the Regional Scientific Ethics 
Committee of Southern Denmark S-20100069.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death 
globally. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based intervention 
recommended for patients with CVD, to prevent recurrent events and to improve 
quality of life. However, despite the proven benefits, only a small percentage 
of those would benefit from CR actually receive it worldwide. This paper by the 
International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation forwards 
the groundwork for successful CR advocacy to achieve broader reimbursement, and 
hence implementation.
METHODS: First, the results of the International Council's survey on national CR 
reimbursement policies by government and insurance companies are summarized. 
Second, a multi-faceted approach to CR advocacy is forwarded. Finally, as per 
the advocacy recommendations, the economic impact of CVD and the corresponding 
benefits of CR and its cost-effectiveness are summarized. This provides the case 
for CR reimbursement advocacy.
RESULTS: Thirty-one responses were received, from 25 different countries: 18 
(58.1 %) were from high-income countries, 10 (32.4 %) from upper middle-income, 
and 3 (9.9 %) from lower middle-income countries. When asked who reimburses at 
least some portion of CR services in their country, 19 (61.3 %) reported the 
government, 17 (54.8 %) reported patients pay out-of-pocket, 16 (51.6 %) 
reported insurance companies, 12 (38.7 %) reported that it is shared between the 
patient and another source, and 7 (22.6 %) reported another source.
CONCLUSIONS: Many patients pay out-of-pocket for CR. CR reimbursement around the 
world is inconsistent and insufficient. Advocacy campaigns forwarding the CR 
cause, supported by the relevant literature, enlisting sources of support in a 
unified manner with an organized plan, are needed, and must be pursued 
persistently.

OBJECTIVES: With the developments of near-cures for hepatitis C virus (HCV), who 
to screen has become a high-priority policy issue in many western countries. 
Cost-effectiveness of screening programmes should be one consideration when 
developing policy. The objective of this work is to synthesise the 
cost-effectiveness of HCV screening programmes.
SETTING: A systematic review was completed. 5 databases were searched until May 
2016 (NHSEED, MEDLINE, the HTA Health Technology Assessment Database, EMBASE, 
EconLit).
PARTICIPANTS: Any study reporting an economic evaluation (any type) of screening 
compared with opportunistic or no screening for HCV was included. Exclusion 
criteria were: (1) abstracts or commentaries, (2) economic evaluations of other 
interventions for HCV, including blood donors screening, diagnosis tests for 
HCV, screening for concurrent disease or medications for treatment.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Data extraction included type of model, 
target population, perspective, comparators, time horizon, discount rate, 
clinical inputs, cost inputs and outcome. Quality was evaluated using the 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. Data are 
summarised using narrative synthesis by population.
RESULTS: 2305 abstracts were identified with 52 undergoing full-text review. 30 
papers met inclusion criteria addressing 7 populations: drug users (n=6), high 
risk (n=5), pregnant (n=4), prison (n=3), birth cohort (n=8), general population 
(n=5) and other (n=6). The majority (77%) of the studies were high quality. Drug 
users, birth cohort and high-risk populations were associated with 
cost-effectiveness ratios of under £30 000 per quality-adjusted-life-year 
(QALY). The remaining populations were associated with cost-effectiveness ratios 
that exceeded £30 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic evidence for screening populations is robust. If a cost 
per QALY of £30 000 is considered reasonable value for money, then screening 
birth cohorts, drug users and high-risk populations are policy options that 
should be considered.
