its performance in real time based on a luciferase reporter system amenable to 
high throughput screening in cells and by extension to evaluation in luciferase 
transgenic animals. Precatalyst 2 activates alloc-protected aminoluciferin 4b, a 
bioluminescence pro-probe, and releases the active luminophore, aminoluciferin 
(4a), in the presence of luciferase-transfected cells. The formation and 
enzymatic turnover of 4a, an overall process selected because it emulates 
pro-drug activation and drug turnover by an intracellular target, is evaluated 
in real time by photon counting as 4a is converted by intracellular luciferase 
to oxyaminoluciferin and light. Interestingly, while the catalytic conversion 
(activation) of 4b to 4a in water produces multiple products, the presence of 
biological nucleophiles such as thiols prevents byproduct formation and provides 
almost exclusively luminophore 4a. Our studies show that precatalyst 2 activates 
4b extracellularly, exhibits low toxicity at concentrations relevant to 
catalysis, and is comparably effective in two different cell lines. This proof 
of concept study shows that precatalyst 2 is a promising lead for bioorthogonal 
catalytic activation of pro-probes and, by analogy, similarly activatable 
pro-drugs. More generally, this study provides an analytical method to measure 
abiological catalytic activation of pro-probes and, by analogy with our earlier 
studies on pro-Taxol, similarly activatable pro-drugs in real time using a 
coupled biological catalyst that mediates a bioluminescent readout, providing 
tools for the study of imaging signal amplification and of targeted therapy.

The hypertrophied manual claws and modified manus of megaraptoran theropods 
represent an unusual morphological adaptation among carnivorous dinosaurs. The 
skeleton of Australovenator wintonensis from the Cenomanian of Australia is 
among the most complete of any megaraptorid. It presents the opportunity to 
examine the range of motion of its forearm and the function of its highly 
modified manus. This provides the basis for behavioural inferences, and 
comparison with other Gondwanan theropod groups. Digital models created from 
computed tomography scans of the holotype reveal a humerus range of motion that 
is much greater than Allosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Tyrannosaurus but similar to 
that of the dromaeosaurid Bambiraptor. During flexion, the radius was forced 
distally by the radial condyle of the humerus. This movement is here suggested 
as a mechanism that forced a medial movement of the wrist. The antebrachium 
possessed a range of motion that was close to dromaeosaurids; however, the 
unguals were capable of hyper-extension, in particular manual phalanx I-2, which 
is a primitive range of motion characteristic seen in allosaurids and 
Dilophosaurus. During flexion, digits I and II slightly converge and diverge 
when extended which is accentuated by hyperextension of the digits in particular 
the unguals. We envision that prey was dispatched by its hands and feet with 
manual phalanx I-2 playing a dominant role. The range of motion analysis neither 
confirms nor refutes current phylogenetic hypotheses with regards to the 
placement of Megaraptoridae; however, we note Australovenator possessed, not 
only a similar forearm range of motion to some maniraptorans and basal 
coelurosaurs, but also similarities with Tetanurans (Allosauroids and 
Dilophosaurus).

Stanford, CA (JLJ, MLB).

OBJECTIVE: To create a simple model to help public health decision makers 
determine how to best invest limited resources in HIV treatment scale-up and 
prevention.
METHOD: A linear model was developed for determining the optimal mix of 
investment in HIV treatment and prevention, given a fixed budget. The model 
incorporates estimates of secondary health benefits accruing from HIV treatment 
and prevention and allows for diseconomies of scale in program costs and 
subadditive benefits from concurrent program implementation. Data sources were 
published literature. The target population was individuals infected with HIV or 
at risk of acquiring it. Illustrative examples of interventions include 
preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), community-based education (CBE), and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for men who have sex with men (MSM) in the US. 
Outcome measures were incremental cost, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and 
HIV infections averted.
RESULTS: Base case analysis indicated that it is optimal to invest in ART before 
PrEP and to invest in CBE before scaling up ART. Diseconomies of scale reduced 
the optimal investment level. Subadditivity of benefits did not affect the 
optimal allocation for relatively low implementation levels. The sensitivity 
analysis indicated that investment in ART before PrEP was optimal in all 
scenarios tested. Investment in ART before CBE became optimal when CBE reduced 
risky behavior by 4% or less. Limitations of the study are that dynamic effects 
are approximated with a static model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model provides a simple yet accurate means of determining 
optimal investment in HIV prevention and treatment. For MSM in the US, HIV 
control funds should be prioritized on inexpensive, effective programs like CBE, 
then on ART scale-up, with only minimal investment in PrEP.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have been unable to disentangle the negative 
associations of black race and low socioeconomic status (SES) with long-term 
outcomes of patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Such information 
could assist in efforts to address both racial and socioeconomic disparities.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a 
prospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI with 17 
years of follow-up, to evaluate the relationship between race, area-level SES 
(measured by zip code-level median household income), and life expectancy after 
AMI. Life expectancy was estimated by using Cox proportional hazards regression 
with extrapolation using exponential models. Of the 141 095 patients with AMI, 
6.3% were black and 6.8% resided in low-SES areas; 26% of black patients lived 
in low-SES areas in comparison with 5.7% of white patients. Post-myocardial 
infarction life expectancy estimates were shorter for black patients than for 
white patients across all socioeconomic levels in patients ≤ 75 years of age. 
After adjustment for patient and treatment characteristics, the association 
between race and life expectancy persisted but was attenuated. Younger black 
patients (<68 years) had shorter life expectancies than white patients, whereas 
older black patients had longer life expectancies. The largest white-black gap 
in life expectancy occurred in patients residing in high- and medium-SES areas 
(P=0.02 interaction).
CONCLUSIONS: Black and white patients residing in low-SES areas have similar 
life expectancies after AMI, which are lower than those living in higher-SES 
areas. Racial disparities were most prominent among patients living in high-SES 
areas.

AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of up to £400 worth of financial 
incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy as an adjunct to routine health 
care.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov model.
SETTING: The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic analysis was 
undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual 
cessation support plus or minus financial incentives of up to £400 vouchers (US 
$609), contingent upon smoking cessation.
MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of usual support and incentive interventions in terms 
of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct 
costs to the NHS.
FINDINGS: The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was £1127 
($1716).This is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton & 
West's published ICER tables, £1390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in 
Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CIPT) incremental cost (£157) and incremental 
6-month quit outcome (0.14). The life-time model resulted in an incremental cost 
of £17 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -£93, £107] and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% 
CI = -0.058, 0.145), giving an ICER of £482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicates uncertainty in these results, particularly 
regarding relapse after birth. The expected value of perfect information was £30 
million (at a willingness to pay of £30 000/QALY), so given current uncertainty, 
additional research is potentially worthwhile.
CONCLUSION: Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly 
cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of 
£482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.

OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is one of the most common forms of chronic dermatitis, 
affecting 2-3% of the worldwide population. It has a serious effect on the way 
patients perceive themselves and others, thereby prejudicing their quality of 
life and giving rise to a significant deterioration in their psycho-physical 
well-being; it also poses greater difficulties for them in leading a normal 
social life, including their ability to conduct a normal working life. All the 
above-mentioned issues imply a cost for the society. This study proposes to 
evaluate the impact on societal costs for the treatment of chronic plaque 
psoriasis with biologics (etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) in the Italian 
clinical practice.
METHOD: A prospective observational study has been conducted in 12 specialized 
centres of the Psocare network, located throughout Italy. Direct and indirect 
costs (as well as the health-related quality of life of patients with plaque 
psoriasis undergoing biologic treatments) have been estimated, while the 
societal impact has been determined using a cost-utility approach.
RESULTS: Non-medical and indirect costs account for as much as 44.97% of the 
total cost prior to treatment and to 6.59% after treatment, with an overall 
71.38% decrease. Adopting a societal perspective in the actual clinical practice 
of the Italian participating centres, the ICER of biologic therapies for 
treating plaque psoriasis amounted to €18634.40 per QALY gained--a value far 
from the €28656.30 obtained by adopting a third-party payer perspective.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that chronic psoriasis subjects patients to a 
considerable burden, together with their families and caregivers, stressing how 
important it is to take the societal perspective into consideration during the 
appraisal process. Besides, using data derived from Italian actual practice, 
treatment with biologics shows a noteworthy benefit in social terms.

BACKGROUND: On 31 December 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force rated 
low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening as level 'B' 
recommendation. Yet, lung cancer screening implementation remains controversial, 
particularly when considering its cost-effectiveness. The aim of this work is to 
investigate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening program for lung cancer by 
performing a systematic literature review.
METHODS: We reviewed the published economic evaluations of LDCT in lung cancer 
screening. MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched for 
literature retrieval up to 31 March 2015. Inclusion criteria included: studies 
reporting an original full economic evaluation; reports presenting the outcomes 
as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained or as Life Years Gained.
RESULTS: Nine economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. All the 
cost-effectiveness analyses included high risk populations for lung cancer and 
compared the use of annual LDCT screening with no screening. Seven studies 
reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the threshold of US$ 100 
000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening for lung cancer is an highly 
debatable issue. Currently available economic evaluations suggest the 
cost-effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer screening compared with no screening 
and indicate that the implementation of LDCT should be considered when planning 
a national lung cancer screening program. Additional economic evaluations, 
especially from a societal perspective and in an EU-setting, are needed.

INTRODUCTION: Even in countries with universal healthcare systems, excess 
mortality rates due to physical chronic diseases in patients also suffering from 
serious mental illness like schizophrenia is such that their life expectancy 
could be lessened by up to 20 years. The possible explanations for this 
disparity include: unhealthy habits (i.e. smoking; lack of exercise); 
side-effects of psychotropic medication; delays in the detection or initial 
presentation leading to a more advanced disease at diagnosis; and inequity of 
access to services. The main objective of this paper is to explore the 
feasibility and acceptability of patient partnership for developing an 
interactive guide to improve access to primary care providers for chronic 
diseases management and health promotion among patients with severe mental 
illnesses.
METHODS: A participatory action research design was used to engage patients with 
mental illness as full research partners for a strategy for patient-oriented 
research in primary care for persons with schizophrenia who also have chronic 
physical illnesses. This strategy was also developed in partnership with a 
health and social services centre responsible for the health of the population 
of a territory with about 100,000 inhabitants in East-end Montreal, Canada. A 
new interactive guide was developed by patient research partners and used by 146 
participating patients with serious mental illness who live on this territory, 
for them to be better prepared for their medical appointment with a General 
Practitioner by becoming more aware of their own physical condition.
RESULTS: Patient research partners produced a series of 33 short videos 
depicting signs and symptoms of common chronic diseases and risk factors for the 
leading causes of mortality and study participants were able to complete the 
corresponding 33-item questionnaire on an electronic touch screen tablet. What 
proved to be most relevant in terms of interactivity was the dynamic that has 
developed among the study participants during the small group learning sessions, 
a training technique designed for healthcare professionals that was adapted for 
this project for, and with patient partners.
CONCLUSION: This research has shown the feasibility and acceptability of patient 
partnership and patient-oriented research approaches to the R&D process of a new 
medical tool and intervention for patients with serious mental illness, and its 
acceptability for addressing inequity of this disadvantaged population in terms 
of access to primary care providers.

The conditional lifetime expectancy function (LEF) is the expected lifetime of a 
subject given survival past a certain time point and the values of a set of 
explanatory variables. This function is attractive to researchers because it 
summarizes the entire residual life distribution and has an easy interpretation 
compared with the popularly used hazard function. In this paper, we propose a 
general framework of backward multiple imputation for estimating the conditional 
LEF and the variance of the estimator in the right-censoring setting. Simulation 
studies are conducted to investigate the empirical properties of the proposed 
estimator and the corresponding variance estimator. We demonstrate the method on 
the Beaver Dam Eye Study data, where the expected human lifetime is modeled with 
smoothing-spline ANOVA given the covariates information including sex, lifestyle 
factors, and disease variables.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are chronic marrow disorders with variable 
prognoses. Most patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or 
even primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are successfully treated with conservative 
strategies for years or even decades, and recent data suggest that even in 
patients with high-risk disease, in particular those with PMF, life expectancy 
can be extended by treatment with janus kinase (JAK2) inhibitors. However, none 
of those modalities are curative, and after marrow failure develops, the disease 
"accelerates," or transforms to acute leukemia, the only option able to 
effectively treat and, in fact, cure MPN is allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT). Outcome is superior if HCT is performed before leukemic 
transformation occurs. Several reports document survival in unmaintained 
remission beyond 10 years. The most recent analyses show reduced regimen-related 
mortality (less than 10% or even 5% at day 100) and progressively improved 
survival with both HLA-identical sibling and unrelated donors. The development 
of low/reduced-intensity conditioning regimens has contributed to the improved 
success rate and has allowed successful HCT in patients in their seventh and 
even eighth decade of life. We propose, therefore, that HCT should be offered to 
fit patients in these age groups and should be covered by their respective 
insurance carriers.

BACKGROUND: Decisions regarding how to treat patients who have 1 to 3 brain 
metastases require important tradeoffs between controlling recurrences, side 
effects, and costs. In this analysis, the authors compared novel treatments 
versus usual care to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from a 
payer's (Medicare) perspective.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a microsimulation of a Markov 
model for 60 one-month cycles. The model used 4 simulated cohorts of patients 
aged 65 years with 1 to 3 brain metastases. The 4 cohorts had a median survival 
of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to test the sensitivity of the model to different 
prognoses. The treatment alternatives evaluated included stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) with 3 variants of salvage after recurrence (whole-brain 
radiotherapy [WBRT], hippocampal avoidance WBRT [HA-WBRT], SRS plus WBRT, and 
SRS plus HA-WBRT). The findings were tested for robustness using probabilistic 
and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Traditional radiation therapies remained cost-effective for patients in 
the 3-month and 6-month cohorts. In the cohorts with longer median survival, 
HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT became cost-effective relative to traditional 
treatments. When the treatments that involved HA-WBRT were excluded, either SRS 
alone or SRS plus WBRT was cost-effective relative to WBRT alone. The 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of 
these results.
CONCLUSIONS: HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT were cost-effective for 2 of the 4 
cohorts, demonstrating the value of controlling late brain toxicity with this 
novel therapy. Cost-effectiveness depended on patient life expectancy. SRS was 
cost-effective in the cohorts with short prognoses (3 and 6 months), whereas 
HA-WBRT and SRS plus HA-WBRT were cost-effective in the cohorts with longer 
prognoses (12 and 24 months).

University, Shanghai, China.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery in advanced 
glaucoma (AG) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients with AG who underwent cataract 
surgeries were collected prospectively from June 2010 through June 2013 in 
Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, and 
were followed up for at least 3 months. A standard phacoemulsification technique 
was used to remove cataract(s). No complications occurred intraoperatively or 
postoperatively. Costs associated with surgery were recorded. Utility values of 
cataract surgery were obtained by using time trade-off method. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were calculated using the patients' life expectancy at a 3% 
discounted rate. Incremental cost-utility analysis was performed (compared with 
no treatment) by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
that is, the mean incremental cost for each QALY. The bootstrap method was used 
for statistical analysis, and sensitivity analyses were performed to test 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The mean incremental cost of cataract surgery was 9876 Chinese yuan 
(CNY) [1593 US dollar (USD)] [95% confidence interval (CI), 9144-10,570 CNY 
(1475-1705 USD)].The mean additional QALYs gained were 2.20 (95% CI, 1.85-2.54), 
and the incremental cost for each additional QALY was 4508 CNY (727 USD) [95% 
CI, 3890-5234 CNY (627-844 USD)], far lower than the per capita annual 
disposable income in Shanghai, 40,188 CNY (6482 USD).
CONCLUSION: For AG patients, cataract surgery does help obtain more QALYs and 
was highly cost effective.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening recommendations are based on results from the 
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The authors determined how the 
screening-eligible US population differs from NLST participants in terms of 
characteristics that affect their ability to benefit from screening.
METHODS: The authors identified respondents to the 2012 Health and Retirement 
Study (HRS), a national survey of individuals aged ≥50 years who are eligible 
for screening based on US Preventive Services Task Force and Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services criteria. Comorbidities, life expectancy, smoking 
history, and other characteristics were compared between the screening-eligible 
population and NLST participants.
RESULTS: The authors estimated that in 2013, 8.4 million individuals (95% 
confidence interval, 7.9-8.9 million individuals) would have met the eligibility 
criteria for lung cancer screening established by the US Preventive Services 
Task Force. Compared with NLST participants, HRS screening-eligible respondents 
were older, more likely to be current smokers, and more likely to have been 
diagnosed with comorbidities. The 5-year survival rate was 87% in the HRS 
screening-eligible individuals versus 93% in the NLST participants (P<.001, 
based on a 2-sided test). Life expectancy was 18.7 years in the HRS 
screening-eligible individuals versus 21.2 years in the NLST participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The US population eligible for lung cancer screening is probably 
less likely to benefit from early detection than NLST participants because they 
face a high risk of death from competing causes. The results of the current 
study highlight the need for smoking cessation interventions targeting those 
patients eligible for screening and tools to help clinicians determine the 
potential benefits of screening in individual patients.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease 
with a survival rate of 4-6 months from diagnosis. PDAC is the fourth leading 
cause of cancer-related death in the Western world, with a mortality rate of 10 
cases per 100,000 population. Chemotherapy constitutes only a palliative 
strategy, with limited effects on life expectancy.
AIMS: To investigate the biological response of PDAC to mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappaB (NF-kB) inhibitors and the role of autophagy 
in the modulation of these signaling pathways in order to address the challenge 
of developing improved medical protocols for patients with PDAC.
METHODS: Two ATCC cell lines, MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1, were used as PDAC models. 
Cells were exposed to inhibitors of MAPK or NF-kB survival pathways alone or 
after autophagy inhibition. Several aspects were analyzed, as follows: cell 
proliferation, by [(3)H]TdR incorporation; cell death, by TUNEL assay, 
regulation of autophagy by LC3-II expression level and modulation of pro-and 
anti-apoptotic proteins by Western blot.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that the inhibition of the MAPK and NF-kB survival 
pathways with U0126 and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), respectively, 
produced strong inhibition of pancreatic tumor cell growth without inducing 
apoptotic death. Interestingly, U0126 and CAPE induced apoptosis after autophagy 
inhibition in a caspase-dependent manner in MIA PaCa-2 cells and in a 
caspase-independent manner in PANC-1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we present evidence that allows us to consider a combined 
therapy regimen comprising an autophagy inhibitor and a MAPK or NF-kB pathway 
inhibitor as a possible treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion resulting mainly from pleural metastases 
of lung adenocarcinoma has clinical relevance, being a sign of poor prognosis 
and low life expectancy. Experimental models can mimic the human condition, 
contributing to advances in current understanding of the mechanisms patients' 
pleural fluid accumulation and possible therapeutic strategies. The objective of 
this study is to evaluate the role of different concentrations of Lewis lung 
carcinoma cells (LLC cells) at the time of induction of experimental MPE and the 
main effects on survival of animals.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received intrapleural injection of 0.1, 0.5 or 1.5 × 10(5) 
LLC cells and survival curve, biochemical and pathological analyses of pleural 
fluid and tissue were analyzed.
RESULTS: Evaluation of weight loss, mobility and survival showed that animals 
that received 0.5 × 10(5) cells maintained more stable condition up to day 14 
and a gain of 6 days survival over mice that received the highest concentration.
CONCLUSION: This study may allow a better understanding the mechanisms involved 
in the development of malignant pleural effusion and it may be promising in 
evaluating therapy to avoid recurrence, as the best time to indicate pleurodesis 
or target therapies.

BACKGROUND: Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often 
present with a lifelong pattern of core symptoms that is associated with 
impairments of functioning in daily life. This has a substantial personal and 
economic impact. In clinical practice there is a high need for additional or 
alternative interventions for existing treatments, usually consisting of 
pharmacotherapy and/or psycho-education. Although previous studies show 
preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in 
reducing ADHD symptoms and improving executive functioning, these studies have 
methodological limitations. This study will take account of these limitations 
and will examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) 
in further detail.
METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial will 
be conducted in N = 120 adults with ADHD. Patients will be randomised to MBCT in 
addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments will take place 
at baseline and at three, six and nine months after baseline. Primary outcome 
measure will be severity of ADHD symptoms rated by a blinded clinician. 
Secondary outcome measures will be self-reported ADHD symptoms, executive 
functioning, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, positive mental health and 
general functioning. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be 
conducted.
DISCUSSION: This trial will offer valuable information about the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of MBCT in addition to TAU compared to TAU alone in adults 
swith ADHD.

OBJECTIVES: To determine health and equity benefits and cost effectiveness of 
policies to reduce or eliminate trans fatty acids from processed foods, compared 
with consumption remaining at most recent levels in England.
DESIGN: Epidemiological modelling study.
SETTING: Data from National Diet and Nutrition Survey, Low Income Diet and 
Nutrition Survey, Office of National Statistics, and health economic data from 
other published studies
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥25, stratified by fifths of socioeconomic 
circumstance.
INTERVENTIONS: Total ban on trans fatty acids in processed foods; improved 
labelling of trans fatty acids; bans on trans fatty acids in restaurants and 
takeaways.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths from coronary heart disease prevented or 
postponed; life years gained; quality adjusted life years gained. Policy costs 
to government and industry; policy savings from reductions in direct healthcare, 
informal care, and productivity loss.
RESULTS: A total ban on trans fatty acids in processed foods might prevent or 
postpone about 7200 deaths (2.6%) from coronary heart disease from 2015-20 and 
reduce inequality in mortality from coronary heart disease by about 3000 deaths 
(15%). Policies to improve labelling or simply remove trans fatty acids from 
restaurants/fast food could save between 1800 (0.7%) and 3500 (1.3%) deaths from 
coronary heart disease and reduce inequalities by 600 (3%) to 1500 (7%) deaths, 
thus making them at best half as effective. A total ban would have the greatest 
net cost savings of about £265m (€361m, $415m) excluding reformulation costs, or 
£64m if substantial reformulation costs are incurred outside the normal cycle.
CONCLUSIONS: A regulatory policy to eliminate trans fatty acids from processed 
foods in England would be the most effective and equitable policy option. 
Intermediate policies would also be beneficial. Simply continuing to rely on 
industry to voluntary reformulate products, however, could have negative health 
and economic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of the recently developed Swedish 
experience-based time trade-off (TTO) valuation of the EuroQol-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L) 
against the hypothetical-based TTO valuations from UK, US, Germany and Denmark.
METHODS: Type 2 diabetes patients from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (N 
= 1,757) responded to EQ-5D-3L questionnaire in 2008. Health utilities were 
compared using a range of parametric and nonparametric tests. Absolute agreement 
and consistency were investigated using intra-class correlations coefficients 
(ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots. Differences in health utilities between 
known-groups were evaluated. Transition scores for pairs of observed EQ-5D-3L 
health states were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: The Swedish tariff (SWT) resulted in substantially higher health 
utilities and differences were more profound for more severe health problems. 
ICC ranged 0.6 to 0.8 and Bland-Altman plots showed wide limits of agreement. 
While all tariffs discriminate between known-groups, the effect sizes were 
generally small. The SWT had higher (lower) known-group validity for 
macrovascular (microvascular) complications. The SWT and UK tariff were 
associated with the lowest and the highest mean absolute transition scores, 
respectively, for 2775 observed pairs of the EQ-5D-3L health states.
CONCLUSION: There were systematic differences between the SWT and tariffs from 
other countries meaning that the choice of tariff might have substantial impact 
on funding decisions. The Swedish experienced-based TTO valuation will give 
higher priority to life-extending interventions than those which improve quality 
of life. We suggest that economic evaluations in Sweden include both Swedish 
experience-based and non-Swedish hypothetical-based valuations through a 
sensitivity analysis.

The Demographic Stretch of the Arc of Life: Social and Cultural Changes That 
Follow the Demographic Transition.

The demographic transition from high to low levels of mortality and fertility 
brings about changes that stretch the “arc of life,” making each stage of life 
longer and creating new ones—a phenomenon we call “the demographic stretch.” 
This stretch can transform societal structure, for example, by extending 
childhood, shifting working ages up, delaying marriage and childbearing, 
improving women’s status and equity, and pushing the burden of chronic disease 
and disability to older ages. Global health efforts must address the resultant 
economic and social changes.
