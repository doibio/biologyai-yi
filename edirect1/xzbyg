welcher Grundlage die ärztliche Aufklärung zu erfolgen hat, wenn es sich dem 
Anschein nach um eine Person im fortgeschrittenen Heranwachsenden-Alter handelt. 
Unter der Voraussetzung, dass die ärztliche Einschätzung für einen geplanten 
Eingriff von einem einverständnisfähigen Patienten ausgeht, kann die hier 
vorgestellte Methode die Bestimmung des 18. Lebensjahres anhand einer 
radiologischen Standarduntersuchung der Kiefer mit Wahrscheinlichkeit leisten. 
Die biologische Breite der Weisheitszahnentwicklung liegt jedoch beidseits des 
18ten Lebensjahres. Die Fehlerbreite nimmt mit zunehmendem Alter ab, 
insbesondere bei der Abschätzung der Volljährigkeit von tatsächlich bereits 
21-Jährigen, erreicht aber auch hier keine vollständige Sicherheit der 
Abschätzung der Volljährigkeit. Die vorgelegten Untersuchungsergebnisse sind 
geeignet, die forensische Altersschätzung in mehreren Bereichen ärztlicher 
Tätigkeit fundiert zu unterstützen. Die Untersuchungsmethoden sind für den 
Behandler jedoch ungeeignet, anhand dieser Berechnungen sich der genauen 
Kenntnis der individuellen Lebensumstände des jeweiligen Patienten zu entziehen. 
Insbesondere die sorgfältig erhobene Lebensgeschichte und körperliche 
Untersuchung bleiben vorrangig zu bestimmende Werte der Personeneinschätzung. 
Die Erweiterung des Berechnungsansatzes durch Anwendung in anderen Populationen 
ist anzustreben.

BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a devastating condition which greatly 
diminishes patients' quality of life and limits life expectancy. Health 
technology appraisals of future interventions in MND need robust data on costs 
and utilities. Existing economic evaluations have been noted to be limited and 
fraught with challenges.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and critique methodological 
aspects of all published economic evaluations, cost studies, and utility studies 
in MND.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed all relevant published studies in English 
from 1946 until January 2016, searching the databases of Medline, EMBASE, 
Econlit, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economics 
Evaluation Database (HEED). Key data were extracted and synthesised narratively.
RESULTS: A total of 1830 articles were identified, of which 15 economic 
evaluations, 23 cost and 3 utility studies were included. Most economic studies 
focused on riluzole (n = 9). Six studies modelled the progressive decline in 
motor function using a Markov design but did not include mutually exclusive 
health states. Cost estimates for a number of evaluations were based on expert 
opinion and were hampered by high variability and location-specific 
characteristics. Few cost studies reported disease-stage-specific costs (n = 3) 
or fully captured indirect costs. Utilities in three studies of MND patients 
used the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire or standard gamble, but included 
potentially unrepresentative cohorts and did not consider any health impacts on 
caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Economic evaluations in MND suffer from significant methodological 
issues such as a lack of data, uncertainty with the disease course and use of 
inappropriate modelling framework. Limitations may be addressed through the 
collection of detailed and representative data from large cohorts of patients.

[Lifespan of Doctorate and Non-doctorate Physicians in Northrine].

[Article in German]

Evers J, Rausch TK.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the lifespan of physicians in 
North Rhine depending on the criterion if they had graduated with a Dr. med. 
thesis under German law or not. North Rhine is part of the German federal state 
North Rhine-Westphalia.
METHODS: The date of birth and date of death of 1133 deceased physicians from 
the journal of the medical association of North Rhine were recorded according to 
their doctoral degree from January 2013 until June 2016 inclusive. For the 
calculation of their length of life, the descriptive statistics and for further 
statistical analysis, the R program 1 was applied.
RESULTS: Physicians with a doctoral degree under German law (Dr. med.) reached 
an average age of 80.9 ± 12.1 years whereas physicians without a dissertation 
reached an age of 67.6 ± 13.8 years, on average. After correction for year of 
birth no significant difference between the average lifespan of the two groups 
could be found.
CONCLUSION: The analysis of the survival data of deceased physicians showed a 
much longer length of life if they had graduated with a doctoral thesis under 
German law, which was not significant after a year of birth correction. For 
every statistical analysis possible confounders need to be considered.

A retrospective analysis was conducted to investigate outcomes of elderly 
patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who underwent 
surgery or chemoradiotherapy (CRT).We performed a retrospective review of the 
records of elderly patients (≥70 years) with resectable ESCC who underwent 
esophagectomy or CRT between January 2009 and March 2013. According to the main 
treatment strategy, patients were allocated into either surgery group or CRT 
group. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival and progression-free 
survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate 
survival analyses were performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional 
hazards model, respectively.A total of 188 patients were enrolled. Eighty-eight 
patients underwent esophagectomy, and 100 patients underwent CRT. The median age 
of the patients was 73 years (range, 70-81 years) in the surgery group and 76 
years (range, 70-88 years) in the CRT group. The median survival time (MST) for 
the whole cohort was 25.6 months, and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 
69.2%, 36.1%, and 21.9%, respectively. The MST in the surgery group and the CRT 
group was 36 months and 15 months, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival 
rates in the surgery group were 82.4%, 49.0%, and 33.3%, compared to 58.0%, 
24.1%, and 7.8% in the CRT group (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed 
that lymph node status (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.598, P = 0.011) and treatment 
strategies (HR = 0.538, P = 0.001) were independent and significant prognostic 
factors for OS in elderly patients.Surgery was the main treatment strategy for 
elderly patients with ESCC. Advanced age and comorbidities should not be the 
cause for elderly patients to avoid aggressive regimens. Delivered therapeutic 
approaches should be individualized on the basis of carefully evaluating the 
balance of benefits, risks, and life expectancy.

Unique Function of the Bacterial Chromosome Segregation Machinery in Apically 
Growing Streptomyces - Targeting the Chromosome to New Hyphal Tubes and its 
Anchorage at the Tips.

The coordination of chromosome segregation with cell growth is fundamental to 
the proliferation of any organism. In most unicellular bacteria, chromosome 
segregation is strictly coordinated with cell division and involves ParA that 
moves the ParB nucleoprotein complexes bi- or unidirectionally toward the cell 
pole(s). However, the chromosome organization in multiploid, apically extending 
and branching Streptomyces hyphae challenges the known mechanisms of bacterial 
chromosome segregation. The complex Streptomyces life cycle involves two stages: 
vegetative growth and sporulation. In the latter stage, multiple cell divisions 
accompanied by chromosome compaction and ParAB assisted segregation turn 
multigenomic hyphal cell into a chain of unigenomic spores. However, the 
requirement for active chromosome segregation is unclear in the absence of 
canonical cell division during vegetative growth except in the process of branch 
formation. The mechanism by which chromosomes are targeted to new hyphae in 
streptomycete vegetative growth has remained unknown until now. Here, we address 
the question of whether active chromosome segregation occurs at this stage. 
Applied for the first time in Streptomyces, labelling of the chromosomal 
replication initiation region (oriC) and time-lapse microscopy, revealed that in 
vegetative hyphae every copy of the chromosome is complexed with ParB, whereas 
ParA, through interaction with the apical protein complex (polarisome), tightly 
anchors only one chromosome at the hyphal tip. The anchor is maintained during 
replication, when ParA captures one of the daughter oriCs. During spore 
germination and branching, ParA targets one of the multiple chromosomal copies 
to the new hyphal tip, enabling efficient elongation of hyphal tube. Thus, our 
studies reveal a novel role for ParAB proteins during hyphal tip establishment 
and extension.

BACKGROUND: The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has increased in 
sub-Saharan countries, including Ethiopia. The contribution of dietary 
behaviours to the NCD burden in Ethiopia has not been evaluated. This study, 
therefore, aimed to assess diet-related burden of disease in Ethiopia between 
1990 and 2013.
METHOD: We used the 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data to estimate deaths, 
years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to 
eight food types, five nutrients and fibre intake. Dietary exposure was 
estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression. The effect size of each 
diet-disease pair was obtained based on meta-analyses of prospective 
observational studies and randomized controlled trials. A comparative risk 
assessment approach was used to quantify the proportion of NCD burden associated 
with dietary risk factors.
RESULTS: In 2013, dietary factors were responsible for 60,402 deaths (95% 
Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 44,943-74,898) in Ethiopia-almost a quarter (23.0%) 
of all NCD deaths. Nearly nine in every ten diet-related deaths (88.0%) were 
from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and 44.0% of all CVD deaths were related to 
poor diet. Suboptimal diet accounted for 1,353,407 DALYs (95% UI: 
1,010,433-1,672,828) and 1,291,703 YLLs (95% UI: 961,915-1,599,985). Low intake 
of fruits and vegetables and high intake of sodium were the most important 
dietary factors. The proportion of NCD deaths associated with low fruit 
consumption slightly increased (11.3% in 1990 and 11.9% in 2013). In these 
years, the rate of burden of disease related to poor diet slightly decreased; 
however, their contribution to NCDs remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary behaviour contributes significantly to the NCD burden in 
Ethiopia. Intakes of diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in sodium are 
the leading dietary risks. To effectively mitigate the oncoming NCD burden in 
Ethiopia, multisectoral interventions are required; and nutrition policies and 
dietary guidelines should be developed.

INTRODUCTION: HIV testing is the entry point for the elimination of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Decreasing external funding for the HIV 
response in some low- and middle-income countries has triggered the question of 
whether a focused approach to HIV testing targeting pregnant women in 
high-burden areas should be considered. This study aimed at determining and 
comparing the cost-effectiveness of universal and focused HIV testing approaches 
for pregnant women across high to very low HIV prevalence settings.
METHODS: We conducted a modelling analysis on health and cost outcomes of HIV 
testing for pregnant women using four country-based case scenarios (Namibia, 
Kenya, Haiti and Viet Nam) to illustrate high, intermediate, low and very low 
HIV prevalence settings. We used subnational prevalence data to divide each 
country into high-, medium- and low-burden areas, and modelled different 
antenatal and testing coverage in each.
RESULTS: When HIV testing services were only focused in high-burden areas within 
a country, mother-to-child transmission rates remained high ranging from 18 to 
23%, resulting in a 25 to 69% increase in new paediatric HIV infections and 
increased future treatment costs for children. Universal HIV testing was found 
to be dominant (i.e. more QALYs gained with less cost) compared to focused 
approaches in the Namibia, Kenya and Haiti scenarios. The universal approach was 
also very cost-effective compared to focused approaches, with $ 125 per 
quality-adjusted life years gained in the Viet Nam-based scenario of very low 
HIV prevalence. Sensitivity analysis further supported the findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal approach to antenatal HIV testing achieves the best 
health outcomes and is cost-saving or cost-effective in the long term across the 
range of HIV prevalence settings. It is further a prerequisite for quality 
maternal and child healthcare and for the elimination of mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV.

As average life expectancy increases there is a greater focus on health-span 
and, in particular, how to treat or prevent chronic age-associated diseases. 
Therapies which were able to control 'biological age' with the aim of postponing 
chronic and costly diseases of old age require an entirely new approach to drug 
development. Molecular technologies and machine-learning methods have already 
yielded diagnostics that help guide cancer treatment and cardiovascular 
procedures. Discovery of valid and clinically informative diagnostics of human 
biological age (combined with disease-specific biomarkers) has the potential to 
alter current drug-discovery strategies, aid clinical trial recruitment and 
maximize healthy ageing. I will review some basic principles that govern the 
development of 'ageing' diagnostics, how such assays could be used during the 
drug-discovery or development process. Important logistical and statistical 
considerations are illustrated by reviewing recent biomarker activity in the 
field of Alzheimer's disease, as dementia represents the most pressing of 
priorities for the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the chronic disease in 
humans most associated with age.

Does the Impact of the Tobacco Epidemic Explain Structural Changes in the 
Decline of Mortality?

Since 1950, most developed countries have exhibited structural changes in 
mortality decline. This complicates extrapolative forecasts, such as the 
commonly used Lee-Carter model, that require the presence of a steady long-term 
trend. This study tests whether the impact of the tobacco epidemic explains the 
structural changes in mortality decline, as it is presumed in earlier studies. 
For this purpose, the time index of the Lee-Carter model in males was 
investigated in 20 developed countries between 1950 and 2011 for possible 
structural changes. It was found that removing the impact of smoking from 
mortality trends took away more than half of the 12 detected trend breaks. For 
the remaining trend breaks, adjusting for smoking attenuated the degree of 
change in mortality decline. Taking the tobacco epidemic into account should 
become standard procedure in mortality forecasts to avoid a misleading 
extrapolation of trends. Nevertheless, more research is needed to identify 
additional factors, such as health-care policies and innovations in medical 
treatment, to explain the remaining structural changes.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a common risk factor for several 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Increasing physical activity could reduce the 
burden of disease due to major NCDs and increase life expectancy. Undergraduate 
physiotherapy students represent a group of young-adults expected to have a good 
knowledge of physical activity. We evaluated physical activity levels of 
undergraduate physiotherapy students of University of Colombo, Sri Lanka and 
determined their motives and barriers for participation in physical activity.
METHODS: All physiotherapy undergraduates studying at the University of Colombo, 
Sri Lanka in 2013 were invited for the study. Phase one was a quantitative study 
to evaluate the physical activity levels and phase two was a qualitative study 
to identify motives and barriers for physical activity and sports in the same 
cohort. Physical activity levels (phase 1) were assessed using the interviewer 
administered International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long-version). The 
qualitative study (phase 2) was conducted in the same population using Focus 
Group Discussions (n = 3) and individual In-depth Interviews (n = 5).
RESULTS: Sample size in phase 1 and phase 2 were 113 (response rate = 98%; 
[N-115]) and 87 (response rat = 97%; [N-90]) respectively. Mean age (±SD) of 
participants was 23.4 ± 1 years. The mean weekly total MET minutes (±SD) of the 
study population was 1791.25 ± 3097. According to the IPAQ categorical score a 
higher percentage of participants were 'inactive' (48.7%), while only 15.9% were 
in the 'Highly active' group. Lack of support and encouragement received during 
childhood to engage in sports activity seem to have played an important role in 
continuing their exercise behavior through to the adult life. Academic 
activities were given priority by both parents and teachers. The environment and 
support from teachers, family and friends were important to initiate and adhere 
to sports and physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher percentage of participants were 'inactive', in spite of 
belonging to a group which is presumed to be knowledgeable regarding the 
benefits of physical activity. A significant negative attitude towards physical 
activity was observed in this cohort of young-adults. This seems to stem from 
earlier in life, due to lack of support and motivation for physical exercise and 
sports, received during primary and secondary schooling. This negative attitude 
has become a significant 'internal' barrier, which has not been changed in spite 
of their education.

Particulate air pollution is becoming a serious public health concern in urban 
cities in India due to air pollution-related health effects associated with 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and economic loss. To obtain the 
quantitative result of health impact of particulate matter (PM) in most 
populated Mumbai City and most polluted Delhi City in India, an 
epidemiology-based exposure-response function has been used to calculate the 
attributable number of mortality and morbidity cases from 1991 to 2015 in a 
5-year interval and the subsequent DALYs, and economic cost is estimated of the 
health damage based on unit values of the health outcomes. Here, we report the 
attributable number of mortality due to PM10 in Mumbai and Delhi increased to 
32,014 and 48,651 in 2015 compared with 19,291 and 19,716 in year 1995. And 
annual average mortality due to PM2.5 in Mumbai and Delhi was 10,880 and 10,900. 
Premature cerebrovascular disease (CEV), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes are about 35.3, 33.3, and 
22.9% of PM2.5-attributable mortalities. Total DALYs due to PM10 increased from 
0.34 million to 0.51 million in Mumbai and 0.34 million to 0.75 million in Delhi 
from average year 1995 to 2015. Among all health outcomes, mortality and chronic 
bronchitis shared about 95% of the total DALYs. Due to PM10, the estimated total 
economic cost at constant price year 2005 US$ increased from 2680.87 million to 
4269.60 million for Mumbai City and 2714.10 million to 6394.74 million for Delhi 
City, from 1995 to 2015, and the total amount accounting about 1.01% of India's 
gross domestic product (GDP). A crucial presumption is that in 2030, PM10 levels 
would have to decline by 44% (Mumbai) and 67% (Delhi) absolutely to maintain the 
same health outcomes in year 2015 levels. The results will help policy makers 
from pollution control board for further cost-benefit analyses of air pollution 
management programs in Mumbai and Delhi.

BACKGROUND: In Colombia, HIV and AIDS constitute one of the major diseases of 
high cost to the health system, making necessary health risk management of 
patients with this disease through comprehensive health care programs with their 
respective evaluation of results.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of a care program for 
patients with HIV/AIDS affiliated to a health insurer in Colombia, comparing 
their results in three Health care provider (HCP).
METHODS: The study population corresponded to a cohort of patients older than 18 
years with HIV/AIDS and affiliated to a health insurer in Colombia during 2011 
and 2012. A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of a health care 
program for this population was performed on the basis of a Markov model, in 
which quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life-years gained were assessed. 
This analysis was conducted from the insurer perspective. The time horizon was 
life expectancy. A discount rate of 3% was applied.
RESULTS: Drugs accounted for 80.54% of care costs. The average annual cost of 
patients in health state 5 was 3 times higher than that of patients in state 1. 
HCP A compared with HCP B generated an additional 1.53 QALYs, with a rate of 
incremental cost-effectiveness of $2400 per QALY gained. HCP C showed a 
dominated behavior. The variables that most influence the uncertainty were the 
cost of HCP A in health state 5 (55.52%) and the cost of HCP B in state 3 
(27.51%).
CONCLUSIONS: HCP A is a very cost-effective option considering a threshold of 1 
time the per-capita gross domestic product.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness associated with the use of 
pneumococcal conjugated vaccines, Prevenar-13 and Synflorix®, in the Mexican 
pediatric population.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness ratio of instrumenting vaccination programs 
based upon the use of Prevenar-13 and Synflorix® in the Mexican pediatric 
population was estimated by using a Markov's simulation model. The robustness of 
the conclusions reached on cost-effectiveness for both vaccines was assayed 
through an univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis that included all 
of the parameters considered by the model.
RESULTS: Synflorix® was dominant over Prevenar-13 in the cost-utility analysis; 
the former generated more quality-adjusted life years at a lower cost and with a 
lower incremental cost-utility ratio. Based on the cost-effective analysis, 
Prevenar-13 generated more life years gained but at a higher cost. The use of 
Prevenar-13 originated a higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and, 
therefore, it was not cost-effective as compared with Synflorix®.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the simulations for Prevenar-13 and Synflorix® revealed 
both of them to be cost-effective when used to instrument pediatric vaccination 
campaigns in Mexico, Synflorix® had a better cost-utility/effectiveness profile. 
In addition, although Prevenar-13 and Synflorix® produced equivalent health 
outcomes, the overall analysis predicted that Synflorix® would save 360 million 
Mexican pesos, as compared with Prevenar-13.

Biochemical failure after primary external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer 
is common, and a significant proportion of these failures are due to local 
residual or recurrent disease. Early or delayed palliation using androgen 
deprivation therapy is the most common approach. Although a conservative 
approach is appropriate for many individuals, selected patients would benefit 
from retreatment with curative intent. We review the pertinent literature on 
salvage of locally recurrent prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy, 
including the modalities of surgery, cryotherapy, high-intensity focused 
ultrasound, or reirradiation with brachytherapy or stereotactic body 
radiotherapy. We discuss patient selection, outcomes, and toxicities. Patients 
with local recurrence and sufficient life expectancy, in the absence of 
metastatic disease, could be considered for local salvage. Although highly 
dependent on patient selection, the efficacy of the various salvage options 
seems comparable, with biochemical-recurrence-free survivals ranging 
approximately 50% at 5 years. The toxicity profiles differ, but all salvage 
treatments are more toxic than primary treatment. Management of isolated local 
failure after radiotherapy remains challenging. However, with the recent 
progress in salvage techniques, and more sensitive functional imaging for tumor 
localization and staging, salvage treatments are likely to play an increasingly 
important role.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility have led to a 
shift in the workforce age structure towards older age groups. Deteriorating 
health and reduced work capacity are among the challenges to retaining older 
workers in the labour force.
AIMS: To examine whether workplace interventions to facilitate work among 
employees with health problems or reduced work capacity affect disability rates 
among employees aged 50 years and older.
METHODS: Data from a survey of Norwegian companies (n = 713) were linked with 
registry data on their employees aged 50-61 years (n = 30771). By means of a 
difference-in-differences approach, we compared change in likelihood of 
receiving a full disability pension among employees in companies with and 
without workplace interventions.
RESULTS: Employees in companies reporting to have workplace interventions in 
2005 had a higher risk of receiving full disability pension during the period 
2001-03 compared with employees in companies without such interventions [odds 
ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.45]. During the period 
2005-07, there was an overall reduction in disability rates (OR 0.83, 95% CI 
0.71-0.96) in both the intervention and control group. However, employees in 
companies reporting to have interventions in 2005 experienced an additional 
reduction in an employee's likelihood of receiving a full disability pension (OR 
0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99) compared with employees in companies without 
interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to facilitate work among employees with health 
problems or reduced work capacity have reduced disability rates among employees 
aged 50-61. This suggests that companies' preventive interventions are an 
effective means to retain older workers with deteriorating health.

Income-based equity weights in healthcare planning and policy.

Herlitz A(1)(2).

Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA.

Recent research indicates that there is a gap in life expectancy between the 
rich and the poor. This raises the question: should we on egalitarian grounds 
use income-based equity weights when we assess benefits of alternative 
benevolent interventions, so that health benefits to the poor count for more? 
This article provides three egalitarian arguments for using income-based equity 
weights under certain circumstances. If income inequality correlates with 
inequality in health, we have reason to use income-based equity weights on the 
ground that health inequality is bad. If income inequality correlates with 
inequality in opportunity for health, we have reason to use such weights on the 
ground that inequality in opportunity for health is bad. If income inequality 
correlates with inequality in well-being, income-based equity weights should be 
used to mitigate inequality in well-being. Three different ways in which to 
construe income-based equity weights are introduced and discussed. They can be 
based on relative income inequality, on income rankings and on capped absolute 
income. The article does not defend any of these types of weighting schemes, but 
argues that in order to settle which of these types of weighting scheme to 
choose, more empirical research is needed.

The black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), was 
reared on artificial diet (wheat bran and chicken feed) in the laboratory at 
28ºC (immature stages) and under a greenhouse set at 28ºC (adults). Data were 
collected and analyzed based on an age-stage, two-sex life table. The intrinsic 
rate of increase (r), ﬁnite rate of increase (λ), net reproduction rate (R0), 
and mean generation time (T) were 0.0759 (d-1), 1.0759 (d-1), 68.225 offspring, 
and 55.635 d, respectively. The maximum reproductive value of females occurred 
at 54 d. Only six females out of 21 were able to successfully oviposit. The 
number of eggs laid per female ranged from 236 to a maximum of 1,088 eggs. We 
demonstrated that first-instar larvae of H. illucens are more susceptible to 
perishing when reared under artificial diet than are later instars.

Publisher: La mosca soldado negro, Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera:

alimento para pollos) en el laboratorio a 28ºC (estados inmaduros) y en un 
invernadero a 28ºC (adultos). Los datos fueron recopilados y analizados en base 
a la tabla de vida de ambos sexos, edad y etapa. La tasa intrínseca de 
crecimiento (r), tasa finita de crecimiento (λ), la tasa neta de reproducción 
(R0) y el tiempo medio generacional (T) fueron 0.0759 (d), 1.0759 (d), 68.225 
crías, y 55.635 (d), respectivamente. El valor reproductivo máximo de las 
hembras se produjo a los 54 días. Sólo 6 de las 21 hembras fueron capaces de 
poner huevos con éxito. El número de huevos por hembra varió de 236 a un máximo 
de 1088 huevos. Hemos demostrado que cuando han sido criados en una dieta 
artificial, las larvas de H. illucens durante el primer instar son más 
susceptibles a perecer que los instares posteriores.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of the German population has steadily risen in 
the course of the past decades. As especially the oldest members of the 
population are treated in geriatric clinics, it would be of interest to 
investigate whether the increase in population age can also be found among 
geriatric inpatients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The demographic data of inpatients of a geriatric clinic 
in Hannover in the years 1994, 2004 and 2014 were analyzed according to age, 
gender and classification as acute care or geriatric rehabilitation.
RESULTS: The mean patient age rose by 6 years in the past two decades. This was 
the case for both men and women but the age of men (+7.5 years) rose more than 
that of women (+4.9 years). Whereas the patient average age increased, 
especially in the first decade (+3.9 years), this increase slowed down in the 
following decade (+1.7 years). The 80 to 89-year-old patients remained the 
biggest and steadily increasing group (in 1994: 41.1%, 2004: 46.9% and 2014: 
51.3%). The greatest increase, however, was found for those aged 90 years and 
older (1994: 4.8%, 2004: 12.2% and 2014: 17.7%).
CONCLUSION: The results confirm the professional experiences of many 
geriatricians in that they care for an increasingly aging clientele. 
Particularly very old male patients in geriatric clinics are increasing. All 
health professional groups involved will have to face this challenge.

AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as add-on to insulin 
in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin-treated Japanese patients were randomized to 5 mg 
dapagliflozin or placebo during a 16-week double-blind treatment period. Both 
groups then received dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg (the dose was increased at or 
after week 24 if glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] at the previous visit was >7.5%) 
during a 36-week open-label extension period. The exploratory efficacy endpoint 
was to assess the maintenance efficacy of 5/10 mg dapagliflozin + insulin over 
52 weeks of treatment. Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events, 
laboratory variables and vital signs.
RESULTS: The changes in HbA1c from baseline to weeks 16 and 52 were -0.62% and 
-0.74%, respectively, in the dapagliflozin group, vs -0.08% and -0.83%, 
respectively, in the placebo-dapagliflozin group. Body weight decreased at both 
time points in the dapagliflozin group and after switching to open-label 
dapagliflozin in the placebo-dapagliflozin group. The total insulin dose 
decreased slightly after starting dapagliflozin. Adverse events occurred in 
82.9% and 71.7% of patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo-dapagliflozin 
groups, respectively. Hypoglycaemia occurred in 35.0% and 41.7% of patients in 
the dapagliflozin and placebo-dapagliflozin groups, respectively, but the 
incidence was not increased by use of dapagliflozin in either trial period. 
Genital/urinary tract infections, renal impairment/failure, volume depletion, 
fracture and hepatic disorders occurred in ≤5% of patients.
CONCLUSION: This trial showed that administration of dapagliflozin as an add-on 
to insulin therapy was effective, was well tolerated and had insulin-sparing 
effects in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

AIMS: To investigate the prognostic burden of previously diagnosed and treated 
malignancies in candidates for percutaneous mitral valve repair (MVR) with 
MitraClip.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 165 patients underwent MVR and 19 (11.5%) had 
been previously treated for malignancy and considered healed with life 
expectancy over 1 year at time of percutaneous MVR. There was a significant 
trend for an increased overall risk profile (euroSCORE II 14.0±11.4 vs 10.0±6.7, 
P=.01) in patients with a previous diagnosis of neoplasia. Moreover, neoplastic 
patients had lower device success rates (78.9% vs 97.3%; P=.001), longer 
hospitalization (12.3±10.6 vs 7.5±4.9 days, P=.001), and higher 30-day mortality 
(10.5% vs 2.7%, P=.09). Kaplan-Meier overall estimated 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year 
survival of the overall cohort was 72%, 61%, 48%, and 44%, respectively. 
Estimated 1- and 2-year survival were 44.4% and 22.2 % in patients with previous 
neoplasia and 75.3% and 65% in the remaining patients (P<.0001). Median survival 
was 312 days in the neoplastic group (CI 95%: 182.6-441.4 days) and 1209 days in 
the remaining patients (CI 95%: 758.8-1659.2 days) (P<.0001). At Cox regression, 
the strongest determinant for mortality was an anamnesis for neoplasia (HR 2.4, 
95% CI 1.4-4.3, P=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Previous neoplasm is a significant independent predictor of 
increased mortality after MVR with MitraClip. This association is even stronger 
than that of other cardiac and overall comorbidities and should be kept into 
consideration when referring patients for treatment.
