[Indications to liver transplantation].

[Article in Czech]

Taimr P.

Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with end-stage liver 
disease in whom this operation would extend life expectancy beyond what the 
natural history of underlying disease would predict or in whom transplantation 
is likely to substantially improve the quality of life. Liver transplantation is 
indicated in end-stage liver disease, in selected liver tumors and in fulminant 
liver failure. The most common indication in adult to transplantation is 
decompensated liver cirrhosis with life expectancy one year or less. Evaluation 
and referral to transplantation center should be considered when a major 
complication of liver cirrhosis occurs - ascites, bleeding due to portal 
hypertension, hepatorenal syndrome or hepatic encephalopathy. MELD score 15 is 
recommended to list patients with end-stage liver disease. In recent years the 
indication of decompensated cirrhosis B and C is declining, on contrary, there 
is an increase in indication for hepatocellular carcinoma and NASH. An extension 
of indications has been observed recently - patients above 70 years of age, 
patients with neuroendocrine tumors among others. In 2016 in Czech Republic 
total 179 livers were transplanted, but only a small fraction of potential 
candidates was referred to transplant centers.

STAT3 is a master regulator of the immune responses. Here we show that M. 
tuberculosis-infected stat3fl/fl lysm cre mice, defective for STAT3 in myeloid 
cells, contained lower bacterial load in lungs and spleens, reduced granuloma 
extension but higher levels of pulmonary neutrophils. STAT3-deficient 
macrophages showed no improved control of intracellular mycobacterial growth. 
Instead, protection associated to elevated ability of stat3fl/fl lysm cre 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to release IL-6 and IL-23 and to stimulate IL-17 
secretion by mycobacteria-specific T cells. The increased IL-17 secretion 
accounted for the improved control of infection since neutralization of IL-17 
receptor A in stat3fl/fl lysm cre mice hampered bacterial control. APCs lacking 
SOCS3, which inhibits STAT3 activation via several cytokine receptors, were poor 
inducers of priming and of the IL-17 production by mycobacteria-specific T 
cells. In agreement, socs3fl/fl cd11c cre mice deficient of SOCS3 in DCs showed 
increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection. While STAT3 in APCs 
hampered IL-17 responses, STAT3 in mycobacteria-specific T cells was critical 
for IL-17 secretion, while SOCS3 in T cells impeded IL-17 secretion. Altogether, 
STAT3 signalling in myeloid cells is deleterious in the control of infection 
with M. tuberculosis.

Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital , New York , NY , USA.

Valbenazine is a selective VMAT2 inhibitor that the FDA approved in April 2017 
for the specific treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a movement disorder 
commonly caused by dopamine blocking agents. Valbenazine acts to decrease 
dopamine release, reducing excessive movement found in TD. Areas covered: This 
drug profile reviews the development of valbenazine and the clinical trials that 
led to its approval as the first treatment specific to TD. The literature search 
was performed with the PubMed online database. Expert commentary: Two clinical 
trials assessing the efficacy of valbenazine have shown the reduction of 
antipsychotic-induced involuntary movement. No life threatening adverse effects 
were found. Data from a 42-week extension study demonstrated sustained response.

The rapid developments in science have led to an increase in human life 
expectancy and thus, ageing and age-related disorders/diseases have become one 
of the greatest concerns in the 21st century. Cognitive abilities tend to 
decline as we get older. This age-related cognitive decline is mainly attributed 
to aberrant changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connections. Recent 
studies show that alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis underlie the increased 
vulnerability of neurons to age-related processes like cognitive decline and 
synaptic dysfunctions. Dysregulation of Ca2+ can lead to dramatic changes in 
neuronal functions. We discuss in this review, the recent advances on the 
potential role of dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis through altered function of 
L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in ageing, with an emphasis on 
cognitive decline. This review therefore focuses on age-related changes mainly 
in the hippocampus, and with mention of other brain areas, that are important 
for learning and memory. This review also highlights age-related memory deficits 
via synaptic alterations and neuroinflammation. An understanding of these 
mechanisms will help us formulate strategies to reverse or ameliorate 
age-related disorders like cognitive decline.

Recent studies have described a reduction in the rate of improvement in American 
mortality. The pace of improvement is also slow by international standards. This 
paper attempts to identify the extent to which rising body mass index (BMI) is 
responsible for reductions in the rate of mortality improvement in the United 
States. The data for this study were obtained from subsequent cohorts of the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994; NHANES 
continuous, 1999-2010) and from the NHANES linked mortality files, which include 
follow-up into death records through December 2011. The role of BMI was 
estimated using Cox models comparing mortality trends in the presence and 
absence of adjustment for maximum lifetime BMI (Max BMI). Introducing Max BMI 
into a Cox model controlling for age and sex raised the annual rate of mortality 
decline by 0.54% (95% confidence interval 0.45-0.64%). Results were robust to 
the inclusion of other variables in the model, to differences in how Max BMI was 
measured, and to how trends were evaluated. The effect of rising Max BMI is 
large relative to international mortality trends and to alternative mortality 
futures simulated by the Social Security Administration. The increase in Max BMI 
over the period 1988-2011 is estimated to have reduced life expectancy at age 40 
by 0.9 years in 2011 (95% confidence interval 0.7-1.1 years) and accounted for 
186,000 excess deaths that year. Rising levels of BMI have prevented the United 
States from enjoying the full benefits of factors working to improve mortality.

The effects of Crenotherapy and exercise in peripheral arterial occlusive 
disease. A comparison with simple exercise training.

Quarto G, Amato B, Serra R, Benassai G, Monti MG, Salzano A, D'Assante R, Furino 
E.

BACKGROUND: Conservative therapies for patients affected by Peripheral Arterial 
Occlusive Disease (PAOD) aim first to correct the risk factors and to slow down 
the disease progression. Among these, exercise has positive effects on blood 
flow, muscle metabolism and well demonstrated systemic effects. These include 
reduction of chronic inflammation markers, improvement of walking mechanics and 
heart function. Controlled physical training increases the ability to perform 
the daily activities improving life expectancy of these patients. The aim of 
this study is to evaluate the effects and the effectiveness of physical training 
performed in thermal water compared to traditional treadmill walking exercise.
METHODS: 98 patients affected by IIb stage PAOD, according to Leriche-Fontaine 
classification, were enrolled. Patients were randomized into two groups: the 
first arm carried out an intensive training program under medical supervision 
(group A); the second one carried out a rehabilitative exercise associated with 
crenotherapy (group B). The following parameters were detected: Ankle-Brachial 
pressure index (ABI), actual claudication distance (ACD), maximum walking 
distance (MWD), flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and the intima-media thickness 
(IMT). All patients underwent Doppler echocardiography and complete biochemical 
assay.
RESULTS: In both groups, there was a statistically significant improvement of 
lipidaemia compared to baseline. When compared with each other, the two groups 
did not show statistically significant differences. There were no significant 
differences between the two groups regarding echocardiographic findings. 
Vascular reactivity study showed a statistically significant improvement of FMD 
after 3 months of exercise in both groups. In crenotherapy group (B) FMD values 
were significantly higher than the treadmill ones (A). In both groups a 
statistically significant improvement in ACD was observed CONCLUSIONS: Our 
experience shows that crenotherapy has similar effects compared to traditional 
physical training in the treatment of PAOD, being equally well tolerated and 
safe; it gives an advantage over conventional physical training in terms of ACD 
and MWD improvement, although not statistically significant, and it is extremely 
welcome to patients compared to traditional physical training.

Publisher: Le terapie conservative per i pazienti affetti da Arteriopatia 
Obliterante Periferica mirano, a correggere I fattori di rischio e a rallentare 
la progressione della storia naturale della malattia. Tra queste, l’esercizio 
fisico ha effetti positive sul flusso sanguigno, il metabolismo muscolare ed 
altri ben dimostrati meccanismi sistemici che includono la riduzione dei markers 
di infiammazione cronica, il miglioramento della meccanica del cammino e la 
funzione cardiaca. L’esercizio fisico controllato incrementa l’abilità di 
svolgere le comuni attività quotidiane, migliorando l’aspettativa di vita di 
questi pazienti. Lo scopo di questo studio è valutare gli effetti e l’efficacia 
dell’esercizio fisico eseguito in acqua termale confrontato con l’esercizio 
tradizionale eseguito su tapis roulant. Sono stati arruolati 98 pazienti affetti 
da Arteriopatia Obliterante Periferica allo stadio IIb della classificazione di 
Leriche-Fontaine. Dopo la randomizzazione, i pazienti sono stati divisi in due 
gruppi: il primo braccio ha eseguito un programma di allenamento intensive sotto 
supervisione medica (gruppo A); il secondo ha eseguito un allenamento 
riabilitativo associate a crenoterapia (gruppo B). Sono stati rilevati i 
seguenti parametri: Indice Caviglia/Braccio (ABI), Actual Claudication Distance 
(ACD), Maximum Walking Distance (MWD), Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) e lo 
Spessore Medio- Intimale (IMT). Tutti i pazienti sono stati sottoposti ad un 
Ecografia Color Doppler Cardiaca e un completo assessment biochimico ematico. In 
entrambi i gruppi, esiste un miglioramento statisticamente significativo della 
lipidemia in confronto al tempo 0. Quando confrontati tra di loro, i due gruppi 
non dimostrano differenze statisticamente significative. Non esistono differenze 
statisticamente significative tra i due gruppi per quanto riguarda i reperti 
ecocardiografici. Lo studio di reattività vascolare ha dimostrato un 
miglioramento statisticamente significativo del FMD dopo 3 mesi di allenamento. 
Nel gruppo B i valori sono significativamente più alti rispetto a quelli 
ottenuti nel gruppo A. In entrambi i gruppi sono stati osservati incrementi 
statisticamente significativi dell’ACD. La nostra esperienza ha dimostrato che 
la crenoterapia associate all’esercizio fisico ha effetti simili comparati al 
tradizionale allenamento riabilitativo nei pazienti affetti da Arteriopatia 
Obliterante Periferica, essendo egualmente ben tollerato e sicuro; la 
crenoterapia conferisce all’esercizio fisico un vantaggio rispetto all’esercizio 
tradizionale in termini di miglioramento dell’ACD e dell’MWD, sebbene non 
statisticamente significativo; inoltre è meglio accettato e tollerato dai 
pazienti rispetto all’esercizio tradizionale.

Does the CDC Definition of Fever Accurately Predict Inflammation and Infection 
in Persons With SCI?

Trbovich M(1), Li C(1), Lee S(1).

Author information:
(1)Audie L. Murphy VA, San Antonio, Texas.

Background: Pneumonia and septicemia have the greatest impact on reduced life 
expectancy in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Fever is often the first 
presenting symptom of infection or inflammation. Thermoregulatory dysfunction in 
persons with SCI may preclude a typical febrile response to infection or 
inflammation and thus delay diagnostic workup. Objective: To determine the core 
temperature of persons with SCI in the setting of infection or inflammation and 
the frequency with which it meets criteria for the CDC definition of fever 
(>100.4°F). Methods: Retrospective review of hospitalized SCI patients over 5 
years with a diagnosis of infection or inflammation (DI), defined by serum 
leukocytosis. In this study, 458 persons with paraplegia (PP) and 483 persons 
with tetraplegia (TP) had 4,191 DI episodes. Aural temperatures (Tau) on the day 
of DI, 7 days prior, and 14 days afterwards were abstracted from medical 
records. Main outcome measures were average Tau at DI, frequency of temperatures 
>100.4°F at DI, and average baseline temperatures before and after DI. Results: 
Average Tau at DI was 98.2°F (±1.5) and 98.2°F (±1.4) in the TP and PP groups, 
respectively, with only 11.6% to 14% of DI resulting in Tau >100.4°F. Baseline 
temperatures ranged from 97.9°F (±0.7) to 98.0°F (±0.8). Conclusion: SCI persons 
with leukocytosis infrequently mount a fever as defined by the CDC, and baseline 
temperatures were subnormal (<98.6°F). Thermoregulatory dysfunction likely 
accounts for these findings. Tau >100.4°F is not a sensitive predictor of 
infection or inflammation in persons with SCI. Clinicians should be vigilant for 
alternative symptoms of infection and inflammation in these patients, so 
diagnostic workup is not delayed.

INTRODUCTION: Although end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and surrogate markers for 
renal dysfunction are frequently used as outcome markers for IgA nephropathy, 
the clinical course after reaching ESRD is not well documented. This study 
examined outcomes of progression to ESRD and age at death in a cohort of adults 
with IgA nephropathy with a long duration of follow-up.
METHODS: Patient and kidney survival of 251 adult patients with IgA nephropathy 
from the southeastern United States diagnosed between January 1, 1976 and 
December 31, 2005 were analyzed.
RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 36.9 years. Most patients were men (69%) 
and Caucasian (95%). Only 46% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 
ml/min per 1.73 m2 at diagnosis. Mean follow-up time from time of diagnostic 
biopsy to death or end of study was 19.3 years. Of 251 patients, 132 (53%) 
progressed to ESRD and 97 (39%) died. Life expectancy was reduced by 10.1 years, 
with a median observed age of death at 65.7 years and a median expected age at 
death of 75.8 years. Eighty-three percent of the deaths occurred after 
progression to ESRD.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is substantially reduced for patients diagnosed with 
IgA nephropathy in the southeastern United States.

The prevalence of heart failure increases with age. Changes in the age 
distribution and growing life expectancy will lead to a further rise. However, 
data concerning drug treatment of heart failure especially in the elderly are 
scarce. Subgroup analyses of the heart failure trials suggest that drug therapy 
in older patients should follow the recommendations in the current guidelines. 
In doing so, several common comorbidities in these patients (e. g., impaired 
renal function) have to be considered and may have an influence on the therapy 
(e. g., drug dose, choice of active pharmaceutical ingredient, etc.). Especially 
in old, multimorbid patients, possible interaction of drugs might play 
a substantial role. In many cases the main goal of the therapy, especially in 
the very elderly, is to improve symptoms and quality of life.

Die Prävalenz der Herzinsuffizienz nimmt mit steigendem Alter deutlich zu. 
Aufgrund von Veränderungen in der Altersstruktur und einer zunehmenden 
Lebenserwartung ist mit einer weiteren Zunahme in den kommenden Jahren zu 
rechnen. Daten zur medikamentösen Therapie der Herzinsuffizienz speziell bei 
älteren Patienten existieren nur zu einem geringen Maße. Subgruppenanalysen aus 
den großen Herzinsuffizienzstudien legen jedoch nahe, dass die Therapie sich an 
der aktuellen leitliniengerechten Therapie der Herzinsuffizienz orientieren 
sollte. Dabei müssen jedoch Komorbiditäten wie v. a. Einschränkungen der 
Nierenfunktion und der mentale Status des Patienten mit ins Kalkül genommen 
werden und ggf. zur Anpassung der Therapie (z. B. Dosierung, Wirkstoffauswahl 
etc.) führen. Gerade bei älteren, multimorbiden Patienten spielen 
Arzneimittelinteraktionen eine wesentliche Rolle. Ziel der Therapie ist in 
vielen Fällen v. a. die Verbesserung der Symptomatik sowie der Lebensqualität.

Neckar, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The mesh fixation technique used in repair of hiatal hernias and 
subxiphoid ventral and incisional hernias must meet strenuous requirements. In 
the literature, there are reports of life-threatening complications with cardiac 
tamponade and a high mortality rate on using tacks. The continuing practice of 
tack deployment for mesh fixation to the diaphragm and esophageal hiatus should 
be critically reviewed.
METHODS: In a systematic search of the available literature in May 2017, 23 
cases of severe penetrating cardiac complications were identified. The authors 
became aware of two other cases in which they acted as medical experts. 
Furthermore, the instructions for use issued by the manufacturers of the tacks 
were reviewed with regard to their deployment in the diaphragm.
RESULTS: Twenty-three of 25 cases (92%) with severe cardiac injuries and 
subsequent cardiac tamponade were triggered by the use of tacks in the 
diaphragm. In six cases (24%), these related to ventral and incisional hernias 
with extension to the subxiphoid area, and in 19 cases (76%) to mesh-augmented 
hiatoplasty. Twelve of 25 (48%) patients died as a result of pericardial and/or 
heart muscle injury with cardiac tamponade despite heart surgery intervention. 
In the tack manufacturers' instructions for use, their deployment in the 
diaphragm, in particular in the vicinity of the heart, is contraindicated. 
Likewise, the existing guidelines urgently advise against the use of tacks in 
the diaphragm, recommending instead alternative fixation techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Tacks should not be used for mesh fixation in the diaphragm above 
the costal arch.

In the past, our inability to cultivate most of the oral microorganisms has 
limited our view of this complex ecosystem. In the present study, we utilized 
next generation deep sequencing techniques to revisit the microbiome associated 
with denture malodour, a growing field with the rise in life expectancy. The 
study population comprised 26 full dentures patients (mean age 71 ± 6.4, 10 
males, 16 females) who visited the Tel Aviv University dental geriatric clinic. 
Denture malodour was rated organoleptically by a single odour judge, and 
dentures scoring 2 and above were considered malodour positive. DNA was 
extracted from the swab samples and analysed using next generation deep 
sequencing 16 s rDNA technology. Taxa identified could be classified into nine 
phyla, 29 genera and 117 species. Malodour positive samples showed a higher 
abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria and the genera Leptotrichia, 
Atopobium, Megasphaera, Oribacterium and Campylobacter. Microbiome analysis 
demonstrated higher bacterial diversity within the malodourous samples and a 
significant difference in the microbial profile within the two groups. Taken 
together these results suggest a difference between the microbial populations of 
malodourous and non-malodourous dentures both in composition and diversity.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate operative techniques and 
long-term results after aortic valve or root repair in patients aged 75 years or 
more.
METHODS: Between November 2002 and January 2016, a total of 815 patients 
underwent aortic valve or root repair. Among them were 100 patients aged 
75 years or more (mean, 78 ± 3; range, 75-88 years), including 17 patients 
operated on an emergency basis because of acute aortic dissection. None/trivial, 
mild, moderate, and severe insufficiency grades were presented in 9, 23, 27, and 
41 patients, respectively. The surgery comprised root repair, cusp repair, and a 
combination of both in 45, 16, and 39 patients, respectively.
RESULTS: Early (30-day) mortality and the rate of permanent neurologic deficit 
were 2% for each. The follow-up was 99% complete, resulting in 427 
patient/years. During the follow-up period (mean duration, 4.3 ± 3.2; range, 
0.02-11.1 years), only 1 patient developed a relevant aortic insufficiency and 
required aortic valve reoperation. There were 24 late deaths, which occurred on 
average 50.0 ± 40.6 months (range, 2.4-135.0) after surgery at the average 
patient age of 82 ± 5 years (range, 75-90). Estimated survival at 5 and 8 years 
was 76.4% ± 5.1% and 71.3% ± 5.9%, respectively, and was similar to those of the 
sex- and age-matched general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstructive aortic valve surgery is a suitable and justifiable 
surgical option in selected elderly patients undergoing operation by surgeons 
with considerable experience in this kind of surgery. It offers low cardiac and 
valve-related mortality and morbidity, leading to life expectancy applicable to 
the patients' ages.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have reported a strong association between 
temperature and mortality. Additional insights can be gained from investigating 
the effects of temperature on years of life lost (YLL), considering the life 
expectancy at the time of death.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this work was to assess the association between 
temperature and YLL at seven low-, middle-, and high-income sites.
METHODS: We obtained meteorological and population data for at least nine years 
from four Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites in Kenya (western Kenya, 
Nairobi), Burkina Faso (Nouna), and India (Vadu), as well as data from cities in 
the United States (Philadelphia, Phoenix) and Sweden (Stockholm). A distributed 
lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the association of daily maximum 
temperature and daily YLL, lagged 0-14 d. The reference value was set for each 
site at the temperature with the lowest YLL.
RESULTS: Generally, YLL increased with higher temperature, starting day 0. In 
Nouna, the hottest location, with a minimum YLL temperature at the first 
percentile, YLL increased consistently with higher temperatures. In Vadu, YLL 
increased in association with heat, whereas in Nairobi, YLL increased in 
association with both low and high temperatures. Associations with cold and heat 
were evident for Phoenix (stronger for heat), Stockholm, and Philadelphia (both 
stronger for cold). Patterns of associations with mortality were generally 
similar to those with YLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Both high and low temperatures are associated with YLL in high-, 
middle-, and low-income countries. Policy guidance and health adaptation 
measures might be improved with more comprehensive indicators of the health 
burden of high and low temperatures such as YLL.

Pepper & Nettle (P&N) suggest that the poor present a "contextually appropriate 
response" to a perceived limited control and to a short life expectancy. We 
argue that differences in health, behavior, or impaired economic decisions are 
better explained by self-control. We discuss the implications of the differences 
between these perspectives and present supporting findings from two intervention 
studies with marginalized populations.

BACKGROUND: New technological breakthroughs in biomedicine should have made it 
easier for countries to improve life expectancy at birth (LEB). This paper 
measures the pace of improvement in the decadal gains of LEB, for the last 
60-years adjusting for each country's starting point of LEB.
METHODS: LEB increases over the next 10-years for 139 countries between 1950 and 
2009 were regressed on LEB, GDP, total fertility rate, population density, CO2 
emissions, and HIV prevalence using country-specific fixed effects and 
time-dummies. Analysis grouped countries into one-of-four strata: LEB < 51, 
51 ≤ LEB < 61, 61 ≤ LEB < 71, and LEB ≥ 71.
RESULTS: The rate of increase of LEB has fallen consistently since 1950 across 
all strata. Results hold in unadjusted analysis and in the regression-adjusted 
analysis. LEB decadal gains fell from 4.80 (IQR: 2.98-6.20) years in the 1950s 
to 2.39 (IQR:1.80-2.80) years in the 2000s for the healthiest countries 
(LEB ≥ 71). For countries with the lowest LEB (LEB < 51), decadal gains fell 
from 7.38 (IQR:4.83-9.25) years in the 1950s to negative 6.82 (IQR: 
-12.95--1.05) years in the 2000s. Multivariate analysis controlling for HIV 
prevalence, GDP, and other covariates shows a negative effect of time on LEB 
decadal gains among all strata.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the expectation that advances in health technology and 
spending would hasten improvements in LEB, we found that the pace-of-growth of 
LEB has slowed around the world.

Hereditary ATTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis (also called transthyretin-type familial 
amyloid polyneuropathy [ATTR-FAP]) is an autosomal-dominant, adult-onset, rare 
systemic disorder predominantly characterized by irreversible, progressive, and 
persistent peripheral nerve damage. TTR gene mutations (e.g. replacement of 
valine with methionine at position 30 [Val30Met (p.Val50Met)]) lead to 
destabilization and dissociation of TTR tetramers into variant TTR monomers, 
which form amyloid fibrils that deposit in peripheral nerves and various organs, 
giving rise to peripheral and autonomic neuropathy and several non-disease 
specific symptoms.Phenotypic and genetic variability and non-disease-specific 
symptoms often delay diagnosis and lead to misdiagnosis. Red-flag symptom 
clusters simplify diagnosis globally. However, in Japan, types of TTR variants, 
age of onset, penetrance, and clinical symptoms of Val30Met are more varied than 
in other countries. Hence, development of a Japan-specific red-flag symptom 
cluster is warranted. Presence of progressive peripheral sensory-motor 
polyneuropathy and ≥1 red-flag sign/symptom (e.g. family history, autonomic 
dysfunction, cardiac involvement, carpal tunnel syndrome, gastrointestinal 
disturbances, unexplained weight loss, and immunotherapy resistance) suggests 
ATTR-FAP. Outside of Japan, pharmacotherapeutic options are first-line therapy. 
However, because of positive outcomes (better life expectancy and higher 
survival rates) with living donor transplant in Japan, liver transplantation 
remains first-line treatment, necessitating a Japan-specific treatment 
algorithm.Herein, we present a consolidated review of the ATTR-FAP Val30Met 
landscape in Japan and summarize findings from a medical advisory board meeting 
held in Tokyo on 18th August 2016, at which a Japan-specific ATTR-FAP red-flag 
symptom cluster and treatment algorithm was developed. Beside liver 
transplantation, a TTR-stabilizing agent (e.g. tafamidis) is a treatment option. 
Early diagnosis and timely treatment using the Japan-specific red-flag symptom 
cluster and treatment algorithm might help guide clinicians regarding apt and 
judicious use of available treatment modalities.

BACKGROUND: Israel is one of the few countries that have a national program for 
quality assessment of community healthcare. We aimed to evaluate whether 
improved performance in diabetes care was associated with improved health of 
diabetic patients on a national level.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide ecological study estimating improvements in 
diabetes-related quality indicators and health outcomes. We estimated both 
correlations between composite measures of diabetes-related quality indicators 
and selected outcomes, and assessed through a joinpoint analysis whether trends 
in selected outcomes changed 4 years after the inception of the national 
program.
RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2010, the prevalence of diabetes in Israeli adults 
increased from 4.8% to 7.4%. During these years, an improvement was noticed in 
most quality indicators (from 53% to 75% for the composite score). Declines were 
noted in rates of blindness, diabetes-related end-stage kidney disease, lower 
limbs amputations and diabetes-related mortality. Significant accelerations in 
decline were noted for amputations in men and diabetes-related mortality in both 
Arab men and women 4 years after the inception of the national program.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that Israel's national program for quality 
indicators in diabetes care in the community has probably had a significant 
impact on the health status of the whole population and may have contributed to 
narrowing gaps in life expectancy between Israeli Jews and Arabs. Future studies 
based on individual-level data are needed to confirm these results.

BACKGROUND: In the UK, life expectancy for people living with a serious mental 
illness, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is reduced by 15-20 years 
compared with the general population. In recent years, evidence based 
guidelines/policies designed to improve their physical health have been 
published, yet a gap remains between recommendations and practice. This case 
study describes how guidelines to support physical health were implemented using 
a quality improvement approach.
CASE PRESENTATION: A quasi-experimental study explored systems and processes for 
assessing the physical health of patients admitted to an acute mental health 
unit. The multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals, service users and 
experts in quality improvement methods developed solutions to improve the 
assessment of physical health, drawing on existing guidelines/policies as well 
as professional and lived experience. Three key interventions were developed: a 
comprehensive physical health assessment; a patient-held physical health 
booklet; and education and training for staff and patients. Interventions were 
co-designed by front-line healthcare staff and service users with iterative 
development and implementation through Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. Real-time 
weekly data were reported on five measures over a 15-month implementation period 
(318 patients) and compared to a 10-month baseline period (247 patients) to 
gauge the success of the implementation of the physical health assessment. 
Improvements were seen in the numbers of patients receiving a physical health 
assessment: 81.3% (201/247) vs 96.9% (308/318), recording of body mass index: 
21.55% (53/247) vs 58.6% (204/318) and systolic blood pressure: 22.35% (55/247) 
vs 75.9% (239/318) but a reduction in the recording of smoking status: 80.1% 
(198/247) vs 70.9% (225/318). However, 31.7% (118/318) patients had a 
cardiovascular risk-score documented in the implementation phase, compared to 
none in the baseline.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the use of a quality improvement approach to 
support teams to implement guidelines on physical health in the acute mental 
health setting. Reflections of the team have identified the need for resources, 
training, support and leadership to support changes to the way care is 
delivered. Furthermore, collaborations between service users and frontline 
clinical staff can co-design interventions to support improvements and raise 
awareness of the physical health needs of this population.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to congenital heart disease 
(CHD) is the third most common cause of PAH, and it is becoming increasingly 
common as improvements in the management of CHD have led to increased life 
expectancy for these patients. The medical management of PAH due to CHD 
(PAH-CHD) is largely the same as what has been used for the treatment of 
idiopathic PAH, though the body of literature supporting this management 
decision is very small. There are currently few studies available which 
specifically focus on the treatment of PAH-CHD. The purpose of this literature 
review is to compare the results of those studies that assessed the response to 
medical therapy among adults with PAH-CHD; studies were excluded if they focused 
on paediatric patients, did not include an assessment of 6 min walking distance 
or specifically assessed combination therapies. This review found that 
riociguat, bosentan, epoprostenol and sildenafil were all capable of improving 
functional capacity and haemodynamic parameters in patients with PAH-CHD, but 
whether this corresponds to an increase in mortality remains to be seen. 
Limitations of this review include the small sample size and variable duration 
of the included studies, which makes drawing direct comparisons between studies 
and the study drugs difficult. The lack of large, randomised double-blind 
clinical trials comparing different drugs head to head highlights an area that 
is ripe for ongoing medical research, the results of which may help shape future 
treatment algorithms tailored specifically for adults with PAH-CHD.

Owing to a dramatic increase in average life expectancy, most countries in the 
world are rapidly entering an aging society. Therefore, extending health span 
with pharmacological agents targeting aging-related pathological changes, are 
now in the spotlight of gerosciences. Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen, a 
species of the genus Panax, has been called the "Miracle Root for the 
Preservation of Life," and has long been used as a Chinese herb with magical 
medicinal value. Panax notoginseng has been extensively employed in China to 
treat microcirculatory disturbances, inflammation, trauma, internal and external 
bleeding due to injury, and as a tonic. In recent years, with the deepening of 
the research pharmacologically, many new functions have been discovered. This 
review will introduce its pharmacological function on lifespan extension, 
anti-vascular aging, anti-brain aging, and anti-cancer properties, aiming to lay 
the ground for fully elucidating the potential mechanisms of Panax notoginseng's 
anti-aging effect to promote its clinical application.

Owing to a dramatic increase in average life expectancy and the Family Planning 
program of the 1970s - 1990s, China is rapidly becoming an aging society. 
Therefore, the investigation of healthspan-extending drugs becomes more urgent. 
Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi) is a major medicinal herb that has been 
commonly used in many herbal formulations in the practice of traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) to treat a wide variety of diseases and body disorders, or 
marketed as life-prolonging extracts for human use in China, for more than 2000 
years. The major components of Astragalus membranaceus are polysaccharides, 
flavonoids, and saponins. Pharmacological research indicates that the extract 
component of Astragalus membranaceus can increase telomerase activity, and has 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, anticancer, hypolipidemic,
