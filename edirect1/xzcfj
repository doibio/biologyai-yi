BACKGROUND: Because gait performance is a marker of organic integrity, and the 
Human Development Index (HDI) of a region impacts the organism globally, this 
paper aims to investigate possible associations between both HDI and HDI 
dimensions at individual level (i.e. education, income, or life expectancy) with 
gait performance in older adults.
METHODS: Searches were conducted on EMBASE and PubMed databases. Eligible 
studies included community-dwelling population aged ≥60years, analysis of at 
least one quantitative gait variable, observational studies, Human Development 
Index or its dimensions (i.e. education, income, or life expectancy).
RESULTS: Thirty-five articles were included in this systematic review. No study 
directly used HDI as an independent variable, but all selected articles found 
relationships between gait performance and one or two HDI dimensions at 
individual-level in the same study. Gait speed was the most common dependent 
variable associated with all three HDI dimensions. Low education, poor income, 
and short life expectancy were associated with worse gait speed, in combination 
and/or independently.
CONCLUSION: No studies were found using HDI as a main variable. Systematic 
evidence showed a strong relationship with all three HDI dimensions: education, 
income, and life expectancy, suggesting that social factors at individual level 
affect gait performance.

OBJECTIVES: 1-To know the preventive prescription (statin, antiplatelet drugs, 
bisphosphonates, calcium and vitamin D and Vit B12) of elderly patients 
previously identified as a CCD (with a complex chronic disease) and ACD (with 
advanced chronic disease and lifetime expectancy of less than 12 months) who 
died during 2015. 2-To assess the correct indication of Proton Pump Inhibitors 
(PPI) to determine potentially avoidable medication.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
LOCATION: Four Primary Health Centres, Castellar del Vallès (Barcelona).
PARTICIPANTS: 128 patients, 70 ACD and 58 PCC.
MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Number of drugs at the time of death from the 6 selected 
group, deprescription (6 months prior to death due to advanced chronic disease), 
primary or secondary prevention and inappropriate prescription of PPI.
RESULTS: Average age of 85'3 years (10,3). 40% took an antiplatelet drug, 
avoidable in 60% of the ACD, since they did not present any previous 
cardiovascular episode. 20% of the patients took statins, in which 48% of the 
cases were primary prevention. The PPI prescription was 67% with inadequate 
indication for use in 49% of these cases. 20% took calcium / Vitamin D and 1,6% 
of the ACD a bisphosphonate. There was a 16% deprescription.
CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of our patients with advanced chronic disease and 
short life expectancy still continue to take preventive and avoidable 
treatments, potentially dangerous due to their side effects. There is a need to 
reflect on what we do with these vulnerable patients.

OBJETIVO: a) Conocer la prescripción preventiva (estatinas, antiagregantes, 
bifosfonatos, calcio/vitamina D y vitamina B12) de los pacientes con patología 
crónica compleja (PCC) y de los pacientes con enfermedad crónica avanzada (ENCA) 
y esperanza de vida inferior a 12 meses que fallecieron durante el 2015. 
b) Valorar la correcta indicación en el uso de inhibidores de la bomba de 
protones (IBP) para determinar medicación evitable.
DISEÑO: Estudio transversal retrospectivo.
EMPLAZAMIENTO: Cuatro centros de salud de Castellar del Vallès, Barcelona.
PARTICIPANTES: Un total de 128 pacientes (70 ENCA y 58 PCC).
VARIABLES: Fármacos activos en el momento de morir de los 6 grupos 
seleccionados, desprescripción (6 meses previos a la muerte por motivos de 
enfermedad crónica avanzada), indicación en prevención primaria o secundaria y 
adecuación en la prescripción IBP.
RESULTADOS: Edad media en el momento de la muerte: 85,3 (10,3) años. El 40% de 
PCC/ENCA tomaban un antiagregante. En el 60% de los ENCA que tomaban un 
antiagregante no había evento cardiovascular previo. El 20% de PCC/ENCA tomaban 
una estatina y en el 48% de los casos por prevención primaria. La prescripción 
total de IBP fue del 67%, con indicación inadecuada del 49%. El 20% tomaban 
calcio/vitamina D y un 1,6% de los ENCA un bifosfonato. Hubo un 16% de 
desprescripción.
CONCLUSIONES: Un porcentaje elevado de pacientes con enfermedad crónica avanzada 
y esperanza de vida corta siguen tomando tratamientos preventivos hasta sus 
últimos días, evitables en muchos casos y no exentos de efectos secundarios. 
Deberíamos aumentar la desprescripción de medicamentos con beneficios a largo 
plazo en este grupo de pacientes.

With rapid population growth, especially in low-income and middle-income 
countries, the generation of waste is increasing at an unprecedented rate. For 
example, annual global waste arising from waste electrical and electronic 
equipment alone will have increased from 33.8 to 49.8 million tonnes between 
2010 and 2018. Despite incineration and other waste treatment techniques, 
landfill still dominates waste disposal in low-income and middle-income 
countries. There is usually insufficient funding for adequate waste management 
in these countries and uptake of more advanced waste treatment technologies is 
poor. Without proper management, many landfills represent serious hazards as 
typified by the landslide in Shenzhen, China on 20 December 2015. In addition to 
formal waste recycling systems, approximately 15million people around the world 
are involved in informal waste recycling, mainly for plastics, metals, glass and 
paper. This review examines emerging public health challenges, in particular 
within low-income and middle-income countries, associated with the informal 
sector. While informal recyclers contribute to waste recycling and reuse, the 
relatively primitive techniques they employ, combined with improper management 
of secondary pollutants, exacerbate environmental pollution of air, soil and 
water. Even worse, insufficient occupational health measures expose informal 
waste workers to a range of pollutants, injuries, respiratory and dermatological 
problems, infections and other serious health issues that contribute to low life 
expectancy. Integration of the informal sector with its formal counterparts 
could improve waste management while addressing these serious health and 
livelihood issues. Progress in this direction has already been made notably in 
several Latin American countries where integrating the informal and formal 
sectors has had a positive influence on both waste management and poverty 
alleviation.

Markov chain models are commonly used to simulate the natural history of human 
papillomavirus infection and subsequent cervical lesions with the aim of 
predicting future benefits of health interventions. Developing and calibrating 
these models entails making a number of critical decisions that will influence 
the ability of the model to reflect real conditions and predict future 
situations. Accuracy of selected inputs and calibration procedures are two of 
the crucial aspects for model performance and understanding their influence is 
essential, especially when involves policy decisions. The aim of this work is to 
assess the health and economic impact on cervical cancer prevention strategies 
currently under discussion according to the most common methods of model 
calibration combined with different accuracy degree of initial inputs. Model 
results show large differences on the goodness of fit and cost-effectiveness 
outcomes depending on the calibration approach used, and these variations may 
affect health policy decisions. Our findings strengthen the importance of 
obtaining good calibrated probability matrices to get reliable health and cost 
outcomes, and are directly generalizable to any cost-effectiveness analysis 
based on Markov chain models.

Estimating Cost-effectiveness of a Multimodal Ovarian Cancer Screening Program 
in the United States: Secondary Analysis of the UK Collaborative Trial of 
Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS).

IMPORTANCE: The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening 
(UKCTOCS) is the largest randomized clinical trial to evaluate screening's 
impact on ovarian cancer mortality, assigning women to multimodal screening 
(MMS) with serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) interpreted using a risk algorithm. 
If the MMS screening method is eventually shown to reduce mortality and be 
cost-effective, then it may be accepted by the medical community as a feasible 
screening tool.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an MMS screening program in the 
United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov simulation model was constructed 
using data from UKCTOCS to compare MMS with no screening in the United States. 
Screening would begin at the age of 50 years for women in the general 
population. Published estimates of the long-term effect of MMS screening on 
ovarian cancer mortality and the trial's published hazard ratios were used to 
simulate mortality estimates up to 40 years from start of screening. Base-case 
costs included CA-125, ultrasound, and false-positive work-up results, in 
addition to a risk algorithm cost estimate of $100. The utility and costs of 
ovarian cancer treatment were incorporated into the model.
INTERVENTIONS: Screening strategies varied by costs of the algorithm and 
treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, rates of screening compliance, ovarian 
cancer incidence, and extrapolation of ovarian cancer mortality.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
mortality reduction of ovarian cancer screening.
RESULTS: Multimodal screening is both more expensive and more effective in 
reducing ovarian cancer mortality over a lifetime than no screening. After 
accounting for uncertainty in the underlying parameters, screening women 
starting at age 50 years with MMS is cost-effective 70% of the time, when 
decision makers are willing to pay $150 000 per QALY. Screening reduced 
mortality by 15%, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging 
from $106 187 (95% CI, $97 496-$127 793) to $155 256 (95% CI, 
$150 369-$198 567).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ovarian cancer screening is potentially 
cost-effective in the United States depending on final significance of mortality 
reduction and cost of the CA-125 risk algorithm. These results are limited by 
uncertainty around the effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality beyond 
the 11 years of UKCTOCS.

Under current guidelines, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive livers are not 
transplanted into HCV-negative recipients because of adverse posttransplant 
outcomes associated with allograft HCV infection. However, HCV can now be cured 
post-LT (liver transplant) using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with >90% 
success; therefore, HCV-negative patients on the LT waiting list may benefit 
from accepting HCV-positive organs with preemptive treatment. Our objective was 
to evaluate whether and in which HCV-negative patients the potential benefit of 
accepting an HCV-positive (i.e., viremic) organ outweighed the risks associated 
with HCV allograft infection. We developed a Markov-based mathematical model 
that simulated a virtual trial of HCV-negative patients on the LT waiting list 
to compare long-term outcomes in patients: (1) willing to accept any 
(HCV-negative or HCV-positive) liver versus (2) those willing to accept only 
HCV-negative livers. Patients receiving HCV-positive livers were treated 
preemptively with 12 weeks of DAA therapy and had a higher risk of graft failure 
than those receiving HCV-negative livers. The model incorporated data from 
published studies and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We found that 
accepting any liver regardless of HCV status versus accepting only HCV-negative 
livers resulted in an increase in life expectancy when Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) was ≥20, and the benefit was highest at MELD 28 (0.172 additional 
life-years). The magnitude of clinical benefit was greater in UNOS regions with 
higher HCV-positive donor organ rates, that is, Regions 1, 2, 3, 10, and 11. 
Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that model outcomes were robust.
CONCLUSION: Transplanting HCV-positive livers into HCV-negative patients with 
preemptive DAA therapy could improve patient survival on the LT waiting list. 
Our analysis can help inform clinical trials and minimize patient harm.

To honour the 175th anniversary of Edwin Chadwick's seminal 'Report on the 
Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Poor', we update Chadwick's famous analysis 
of geographical differences in occupational based inequalities. Much of the 
field of Health Geography owes both its direction of development and its initial 
impetus to his 1842 report. The report presented evidence for the importance of 
local context to health, with individuals of the lowest occupations in Rutland 
living longer than individuals of the highest occupations in Liverpool. Here we 
update the 1842 analysis using data from the Office of National Statistics on 
individual mortality records by occupation (2010-12) and population data from 
the 2011 Census. Sex-specific directly standardised premature (16-74) mortality 
rates were calculated for hierarchical occupational categories similar to 
Chadwick's categories, for the nearest equivalent areas to those used in 
Chadwick's report. Although there is no longer consistent evidence on 
individuals in the lowest occupational group having lower mortality rates than 
those in the highest group, there were clear social gradients in mortality 
within each area and the extent of these inequalities varied between areas. 
Individuals who live in Rutland had lower premature mortality rates across each 
occupational group compared to the other areas. Our results demonstrate that 
while life expectancy has nearly doubled since Chadwick's report, social and 
spatial inequalities in health have persisted. We suggest that Chadwick's legacy 
on the importance of locality continues.

BACKGROUND: Information about the burden of (non-fatal) road traffic injury is 
very useful to further improve road safety policy. Previous studies calculated 
the burden of injury in individual countries. This paper estimates and compares 
the burden of non-fatal serious road traffic injuries in six EU 
countries/regions: Austria, Belgium, England, The Netherlands, the Rhône region 
in France and Spain.
METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study based on hospital discharge databases.
POPULATION: of study are patients hospitalized with MAIS3+ due to road traffic 
injuries. The burden of injury (expressed in years lived with disability (YLD)) 
is calculated applying a method that is developed within the INTEGRIS study. The 
method assigns estimated disability information to the casualties using the 
EUROCOST injury classification.
RESULTS: The average burden per MAIS3+ casualty varies between 2.4 YLD and 3.2 
YLD per casualty. About 90% of the total burden of injury of MAIS3+ casualties 
is due to lifelong consequences that are experienced by 19% to 33% of the MAIS3+ 
casualties. Head injuries, spinal cord injuries and injuries to the lower 
extremities are responsible for more than 90% of the total burden of MAIS3+ road 
traffic injuries. Results per transport mode differ between the countries. 
Differences between countries are mainly due to differences in age distribution 
and in the distribution over EUROCOST injury groups of the casualties.
CONCLUSION: The analyses presented in this paper can support further improvement 
of road safety policy. Countermeasures could for example be focused at reducing 
skull and brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and injuries to the lower 
extremities, as these injuries are responsible for more than 90% of the total 
burden of injury of MAIS3+ casualties.

CONTEXT: With prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and life expectancy rising 
in Senegal, the need for palliative care is likely growing. No national 
palliative care needs assessments have been carried out.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the capacity and need for palliative care in Senegal.
METHODS: A multicomponent assessment of availability and demand for palliative 
care was conducted in two tertiary and two regional hospitals in Senegal in 2015 
with approval from Senegal's National Ethics Committee for Health Research. The 
assessment consisted of (1) an inpatient hospital census; (2, 3) surveys of 
inpatients and outpatients with life-limiting illness; (4) a knowledge, 
attitudes, and practices survey among health care workers; and (5) a facility 
survey to assess availability of palliative care medications.
RESULTS: Nearly half (44.4%) of all inpatients (n = 167) had an active 
life-limiting illness. Among them, 56.6% reported moderate-to-severe pain in the 
past three days, 2.3% of whom received morphine, and 76.7% received weak or no 
pain medication. Inpatients also experienced moderate-to-severe dyspnea (42.1%), 
fatigue (66.5%), nausea (16.5%), and drowsiness (42.1%). About 39.2% of all 
outpatients (n = 395) reported moderate-to-severe pain, and 52.8% reported that 
the treatment they had received relieved their pain only partially or not at 
all. Two-thirds of all doctors reported feeling comfortable prescribing pain 
medicines; however, 83.0% rarely or never prescribed morphine. Two of four 
hospitals reported no use of morphine in 2014.
CONCLUSION: There is significant need for palliative care in Senegal. Training 
of health care workers and ensuring availability of relevant medications should 
be prioritized.

highly active antiretroviral therapy prolonged the life expectancy of these 
patients and allowed the manifestation of disorders directly or indirectly 
related to HIV infection, mainly liver, kidney and cardiovascular diseases. We 
present a case of cardiac transplantation due to dilated cardiomyopathy that was 
performed in a patient with a recently detected HIV infection. At 24 month 
follow-up, the patient is in very good health status, his CD4 are increasing and 
the viral load is undetectable. He did not present transplant rejection or any 
other complication. To our knowledge, there is no previous publication on heart 
transplantation in patients with HIV in South America. In view of the successful 
outcome of our case and of the few cases reported in the international 
literature, we consider that heart transplantation is a therapeutic option in 
correctly selected HIV patients.

The health of the global population has undergone rapid transformation. Life 
expectancy and chronic conditions are increasing, and persons aged 65 years or 
older have become the fastest growing segment of population. The worldwide 
picture of disease burden is increasingly defined by disability instead of 
premature mortality. Population growth, ageing and sedentary lifestyles, 
particularly in developing countries, will result in a crisis for the population 
health that requires a multi-system response. The growing awareness of the 
diseases burden increases the need for accurate measurement and assessment of 
the burden and measurement of the impact of any public health action. 
Musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases are increasingly recognised as a major and 
important group of diseases, which requires more attention from society and 
health care systems. The epidemiological evidence confirms the dramatic increase 
in the majority of MSK disorders with age, a phenomenon that is occurring in all 
parts of the world, particularly among females. There is a necessity to ensure 
global health policies to recognise the importance of disability burden for 
overall health, well-being and economic prosperity for the individual and 
society. It is important to promote a common goal between public health, primary 
care, specialised health and social services to reduce disability; to encourage 
health programs or models of care addressing chronic conditions, including the 
importance of primary and secondary prevention, early intervention, care 
coordination, access to a multidisciplinary team to address the bio-psychosocial 
aspects of chronic conditions. There is an identified need to develop a Health 
Care Systems response to enable the implementation of early intervention as an 
effective strategy to reduce the burden of MSK disorders with particular 
importance and potential gains for the target population of older people who 
have shown an acute loss of function due to MSK diseases. It will contribute to 
meeting the 'triple aim' goals in health systems of improving patient's care 
experience (satisfaction, confidence and trust), improving the health of people 
and populations (mortality, disability and quality of life) and improving the 
societal costs of diseases.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) 
has significantly improved in recent decades, with non-cardiovascular causes of 
death now competing with traditional cardiovascular causes. The risk of sudden 
cardiac death (SCD), a devastating event, still remains elevated above that of 
the general population.
METHODS: We reviewed 2935 patients in our adult CHD database (age≥16years, seen 
at least once in our centre) and documented all cases of SCD between 2000-2015. 
Incidence and characteristics of SCD cases by congenital defect and complexity 
of disease were determined.
RESULTS: We documented 35 cases of SCD, with an incidence of 0.4 
deaths/1000patientyears (py). Incidence in simple, moderate and complex 
congenital categories was 0.04/1000py, 0.57/1000py and 2.0/1000py respectively. 
The highest risk category was Eisenmenger syndrome, with an incidence of 4.8 
deaths/1000py. Moderate risk lesions included transposition of the great 
arteries (atrial switch surgery or congenitally corrected) and Fontan 
circulations. Repaired tetralogy, atrial septal defect and left ventricular 
outflow tract lesions were all relatively low risk. We observed a high 
prevalence of atrial arrhythmias (43%) and QRS prolongation (mean 132ms) in our 
SCD cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The adult CHD population remains at an elevated risk for SCD, 
particularly in the setting of complex underlying defects. Moderate to high risk 
lesions include Eisenmenger syndrome, transposition of the great arteries 
(atrial switch or congenitally corrected) and Fontan circulations.

We herein report the case of a young woman who was diagnosed with primary 
hyperparathyroidism and in whom genetic testing confirmed a diagnosis of 
hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Familial hyperparathyroidism was 
suspected based on the patient's young age at the onset of the disease. Thus, 
genetic testing was performed. It showed a germline mutation in the HRPT2/CDC73 
gene and confirmed the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. 
Total parathyroidectomy was performed to prevent recurrence. In patients with 
early-onset hyperparathyroidism, genetic testing should be considered to 
facilitate the selection of a proper surgical procedure based on the 
consideration of future life expectancy.

This study shed light on the amount and structure of utilization and medical 
expenses on Shanghai permanent residents based on big data, simulated lifetime 
medical expenses through combining of expenses data and life table model, and 
explored the dynamic pattern of aging on medical expenditures. 5 years were 
taken as the class interval, the study collected and did the descriptive 
analysis on the medical services utilization and medical expenses information 
for all ages of Shanghai permanent residents in 2015, simulated lifetime medical 
expenses by using current life table and cross-section expenditure data. The 
results showed that in 2015, outpatient and emergency visits per capita in the 
elderly group (aged 60 and over) was 4.1 and 4.5 times higher than the childhood 
group (aged 1-14), and the youth and adult group (aged 15-59); hospitalization 
per capita in the elderly group was 3.0 and 3.5 times higher than the childhood 
group, and the youth and adult group. People survived in the 60-64 years group, 
their expected whole medical expenses (105,447 purchasing power parity Dollar) 
in the rest of their lives accounted for 75.6% of their lifetime. A similar 
study in Michigan, US showed that the expenses of the population aged 65 and 
over accounted for 1/2 of lifetime medical expenses, which is much lower than 
Shanghai. The medical expenses of the advanced elderly group (aged 80 and over) 
accounted for 38.8% of their lifetime expenses, including 38.2% in outpatient 
and emergency, and 39.5% in hospitalization, which was slightly higher than 
outpatient and emergency. There is room to economize in medical expenditures of 
the elderly people in Shanghai, especially controlling hospitalization expenses 
is the key to saving medical expenses of elderly people aged over 80 and over.

Life-history strategy, resource dispersion and phylogenetic associations shape 
dispersal of a fig wasp community.

BACKGROUND: The combined influence of life-history strategy and resource 
dispersion on dispersal evolution of a biological community, and by extension, 
on community assemblage, has received sparse attention. Highly specialized fig 
wasp communities are ideal for addressing this question since the life-history 
strategies that affect their pace of life and the dispersion of their 
oviposition resources vary. We compared dispersal capacities of the wasp 
community of a widespread tropical fig, Ficus racemosa, by measuring flight 
durations, somatic lipid content and resting metabolic rates.
RESULTS: Wasp species exhibiting greater flight durations had higher energy 
reserves and resting metabolic rates. "Fast"-paced species showed higher 
dispersal capacities reflecting requirements for rapid resource location within 
short adult lifespans. Longer-lived "slow"-paced species exhibited lower 
dispersal capacities. Most dispersal traits were negatively related with 
resource dispersion while their variances were positively related with this 
variable, suggesting that resource dispersion selects for dispersal capacity. 
Dispersal traits exhibited a phylogenetic signal.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a combination of phylogeny, trait functionality and community 
features, we explain how dispersal traits may have co-evolved with life-history 
strategies in fig wasps and influenced a predisposition for dispersal. We 
speculate how processes influencing dispersal trait expression of community 
members may affect resource occupancy and community assemblage.

BACKGROUND: The corallum is crucial in building coral reefs and in diagnosing 
systematic relationships in the order Scleractinia. However, molecular 
phylogenetic analyses revealed a paraphyly in a majority of traditional families 
and genera among Scleractinia showing that other biological attributes of the 
coral, such as polyp morphology and reproductive traits, are underutilized. 
Among scleractinian genera, the Euphyllia, with nine nominal species in the 
Indo-Pacific region, is one of the groups that await phylogenetic resolution. 
Multiple genetic markers were used to construct the phylogeny of six Euphyllia 
species, namely E. ancora, E. divisa, E. glabrescens, E. paraancora, E. 
paradivisa, and E. yaeyamaensis. The phylogeny guided the inferences on the 
contributions of the colony structure, polyp morphology, and life history traits 
to the systematics of the largest genus in Euphyllidae (clade V) and, by 
extension, to the rest of clade V.
RESULTS: Analyses of cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1), cytochrome b (cytb), and 
β-tubulin genes of 36 colonies representing Euphyllia and a confamilial species, 
Galaxea fascicularis, reveal two distinct groups in the Euphyllia that 
originated from different ancestors. Euphyllia glabrescens formed a separate 
group. Euphyllia ancora, E. divisa, E. paraancora, E. paradivisa, and E. 
yaeyamaensis clustered together and diverged from the same ancestor as G. 
fascicularis. The 3'-end of the cox1 gene of Euphyllia was able to distinguish 
morphospecies.
DISCUSSION: Species of Euphyllia were traditionally classified into two 
subgenera, Euphyllia and Fimbriaphyllia, which represented a dichotomy on colony 
structure. The paraphyletic groups retained the original members of the 
subgenera providing a strong basis for recognizing Fimbriaphyllia as a genus. 
However, colony structure was found to be a convergent trait between Euphyllia 
and Fimbriaphyllia, while polyp shape and length, sexuality, and reproductive 
mode defined the dichotomy better. Species in a genus are distinguished by 
combining polyp morphology and colony form. The cluster of E. glabrescens of the 
Euphyllia group is a hermaphroditic brooder with long, tubular tentacles with 
knob-like tips, and a phaceloid colony structure. The Fimbriaphyllia group, with 
F. paraancora, F. paradivisa, F. ancora, F. divisa, and F. yaeyamaensis, are 
gonochoric broadcast spawners with short polyps, mixed types of tentacle shapes, 
and a phaceloid or flabello-meandroid skeleton. Soft-tissue morphology of G. 
fascicularis and Ctenella chagius were found to be consistent with the 
dichotomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The paraphyly of the original members of the previous subgenera 
justify recognizing Fimbriaphyllia as a genus. The integrated approach 
demonstrates that combining polyp features, reproductive traits, and skeletal 
morphology is of high systematic value not just to Euphyllia and Fimbriaphyllia 
but also to clade V; thus, laying the groundwork for resolving the phylogeny of 
clade V.

On Effective Graphic Communication of Health Inequality: Considerations for 
Health Policy Researchers.

Policy Points: Effective graphs can be a powerful tool in communicating health 
inequality. The choice of graphs is often based on preferences and familiarity 
rather than science. According to the literature on graph perception, effective 
graphs allow human brains to decode visual cues easily. Dot charts are easier to 
decode than bar charts, and thus they are more effective. Dot charts are a 
flexible and versatile way to display information about health inequality. 
Consistent with the health risk communication literature, the captions 
accompanying health inequality graphs should provide a numerical, explicitly 
calculated description of health inequality, expressed in absolute and relative 
terms, from carefully thought-out perspectives.
CONTEXT: Graphs are an essential tool for communicating health inequality, a key 
health policy concern. The choice of graphs is often driven by personal 
preferences and familiarity. Our article is aimed at health policy researchers 
developing health inequality graphs for policy and scientific audiences and 
seeks to (1) raise awareness of the effective use of graphs in communicating 
health inequality; (2) advocate for a particular type of graph (ie, dot charts) 
to depict health inequality; and (3) suggest key considerations for the captions 
accompanying health inequality graphs.
METHODS: Using composite review methods, we selected the prevailing 
recommendations for improving graphs in scientific reporting. To find the 
origins of these recommendations, we reviewed the literature on graph perception 
and then applied what we learned to the context of health inequality. In 
addition, drawing from the numeracy literature in health risk communication, we 
examined numeric and verbal formats to explain health inequality graphs.
FINDINGS: Many disciplines offer commonsense recommendations for visually 
presenting quantitative data. The literature on graph perception, which defines 
effective graphs as those allowing the easy decoding of visual cues in human 
brains, shows that with their more accurate and easier-to-decode visual cues, 
dot charts are more effective than bar charts. Dot charts can flexibly present a 
large amount of information in limited space. They also can easily accommodate 
typical health inequality information to describe a health variable (eg, life 
expectancy) by an inequality domain (eg, income) with domain groups (eg, poor 
and rich) in a population (eg, Canada) over time periods (eg, 2010 and 2017). 
The numeracy literature suggests that a health inequality graph's caption should 
provide a numerical, explicitly calculated description of health inequality 
expressed in absolute and relative terms, from carefully thought-out 
perspectives.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the ubiquity of graphs, the health inequality field should 
learn from the vibrant multidisciplinary literature how to construct effective 
graphic communications, especially by considering to use dot charts.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of idelalisib 
in combination with rituximab (IR) versus rituximab monotherapy (R) in the 
treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL), from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival Markov model for a lifetime horizon (30 years) 
was developed to estimate costs (€, 2016) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
with IR and R. Initial cohort included patients with CLL receiving a second or 
subsequent line (2L) of treatment with IR or R. Survival data were based on CLL 
clinical trial. Drug, administration, monitoring, adverse events and clinical 
management of CLL costs were included in the model. Costs and outcomes were 
discounted using a 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSA) were performed.
RESULTS: Compared to R, 2L IR treatment resulted in QALY gain of 3.147 (4.965 
versus 1.818). Total costs were €118 254 for IR versus €23 874 for R. ICUR was 
€29 990/QALY gained with IR versus R. In the PSA, IR was cost-effective in 78% 
of iterations using a threshold of €45 000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: IR can be considered a cost-effective treatment compared to R, in 
the treatment of R/R CLL patients for the Spanish NHS.

BACKGROUND: Since March, 2011, the Syrian civil war has lowered life expectancy 
by as much as 20 years. We describe demographic, spatial, and temporal patterns 
of direct deaths of civilians and opposition combatants from conflict-related 
violence in 6 years of war.
METHODS: We analysed conflict-related violent deaths with complete information 
on date, place, and cause of death and demographic group occurring from March 
18, 2011, to Dec 31, 2016, recorded by the Violation Documentation Center (VDC). 
We included civilian and combatant deaths in all Syrian governorates, excluding 
government-controlled areas. We did not include detainees and missing persons, 
nor deaths from siege conditions or insufficient medical care. We categorised 
deaths based on VDC weapon type. We used χ2 testing to compare deaths from 
different weapons in civilian men, women, boys, and girls and adult and child 
combatants. We analysed deaths by governorate and over time.
FINDINGS: The VDC recorded 143 630 conflict-related violent deaths with complete 
information between March 18, 2011, and Dec 31, 2016. Syrian civilians 
constituted 101 453 (70·6%) of the deaths compared with 42 177 (29·4%) 
opposition combatants. Direct deaths were caused by wide-area weapons of 
shelling and air bombardments in 58 099 (57·3%) civilians, including 8285 
(74·6%) civilian women and 13 810 (79·4%) civilian children, and in 4058 (9·6%) 
opposition combatants. Proportions of children among civilian deaths increased 
from 8·9% (388 of 4254 civilian deaths) in 2011 to 19·0% (4927 of 25 972) in 
2013 and to 23·3% (2662 of 11 444) in 2016. Of 7566 deaths from barrel bombs, 
7351 (97·2%) were civilians, of whom 2007 (27·3%) were children. Of 20 281 
deaths by execution, 18 747 (92·4%) were civilians and 1534 (7·6%) were 
opposition combatants. Compared with opposition child soldiers who were male
