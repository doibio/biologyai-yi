IOC de rutina versus la IOC selectiva durante la colecistectomía para diferentes 
escenarios.
RESULTADOS: En este metaanálisis se incluyeron ocho estudios con más de 2 
millones de pacientes sometidos a colecistectomía y 9.000 BDIs. La tasa de BDI 
se estimó en un 0,36% cuando la IOC se realizó de forma rutinaria, en 
comparación con un 0,53% cuando se utilizó de forma selectiva, lo que implicaba 
un aumento del riesgo de BDI del 43% cuando se utilizó la IOC de forma selectiva 
(razón de oportunidades, odds ratio, OR 1,43; i.c. del 95% 1,22 a 1,67). El 
análisis del modelo económico estimó que la IOC de rutina evitaba siete lesiones 
al año en Suecia, una población de 10 millones de personas. Durante un periodo 
de diez años, se obtendrían 33 QALYs a un coste neto de 808.000 € con un coste 
por QALY de 24.900 €.
CONCLUSIÓN: La IOC de rutina durante la colecistectomía reduce el riesgo de BDI 
en comparación con la estrategia de la realización selectiva y es una 
intervención potencialmente rentable.

Concentration-response function for exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) 
and mortality (i.e., relative risk, RR) may be inequal across communities by 
socioeconomic conditions. Investigation on specific mechanisms of this 
inequality regarding susceptibility to PM, beyond non-specific "socioeconomic 
conditions", would provide policy-relevant implications for tackling this 
inequality. However, such investigation via epidemiological studies is 
challenged by residual confounding by correlated mechanisms and different loss 
of life expectancy by PM exposures between communities. Here, we aimed to assess 
community characteristics including different aspects of socioeconomic 
deprivation, medical resources, health behaviors, air quality, and greenness in 
their relation to inequal RR for PM10 and cause-specific mortality in 72 
municipalities in South Korea, 2006-2013, considering these challenges. We found 
that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 on average across 46 days was associated with a 
1.05% (95% CI: 0.24, 1.88) increase in all-cause mortality (ALL), 1.32% (95% CI: 
-0.29, 2.95) increase in cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and 6.47% (95% CI: 
3.06, 10.00) increase in respiratory mortality (RES). The association between 
PM10 and mortality was higher in communities with higher ratio of SO2 to PM10 
(ALL and RES), higher material deprivation (ALL, CVD, and RES), lower medical 
resources (CVD), higher prevalence of drinking (ALL and CVD), and lower 
prevalence of smoking (CVD and RES). Lag-structures showed smaller loss of life 
expectancy by PM exposures in communities with higher prevalence of smoking. Our 
findings suggest that PM-related health inequalities are shaped by a variety of 
mechanisms relating to susceptibility to PM exposures and different loss of life 
expectancy. Health policies controlling community characteristics may contribute 
to minimizing PM10-related health inequalities in those perspectives.

Commuters are reportedly exposed to severe traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) 
during their commuting trips. This study was designed and implemented to (1) 
compare particulate matter (PM) exposure across four common transportation 
modes; (2) examine and analyze various determining factors; and (3) estimate 
public health effects caused by commuting exposure to PM. All analyses and 
calculations were based on the experimental data collected from 13 volunteers, 
including heart-rate data on 336 commuting trips in four travel modes in Xi'an 
China. The results indicate highest PM exposure associated with cycling (average 
PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 of 114.35, 72.37 and 56.51 μg/m3, respectively), followed 
by riding transit buses (116.29, 67.60 and 51.12 μg/m3 for the same pollutants, 
respectively), then taking a taxi (97.61, 58.87 and 45.11 μg/m3), and the lowest 
exposure onboard subways (55.86, 46.20 and 40.20 μg/m3). A multivariable linear 
regression model was used to examine major influences on PM concentration 
variations, with results corroborating significant PM variance across commuting 
modes, which is also affected by background pollution concentration and relative 
humidity. Further, years of life expectancy (YLE) loss were estimated using an 
inhalation dose model together with the life table method: cycling commuters 
experienced the greatest YLE loss (5.51-6.43 months per capita for the studied 
age group). During severe pollution periods, substituting other modes (like 
subway) for cycling could effectively avoid acute exposure. PM2.5 levels in taxi 
cabins powered by CNG or methanol were comparatively lower, indicating that 
implementing alternative energy strategies could effectively lower traffic 
emissions and population exposure.

Maintenance of a balance between the levels of viral replication and selective 
pressure from the immune systems of insect vectors is one of the prerequisites 
for efficient transmission of insect-borne propagative phytoviruses. The 
mechanism regulating the adaptation of RNA viruses to insect vectors by genomic 
variation remains unknown. Our previous study demonstrated an extension of the 
3'-untranslated terminal region (UTR) of two genomic segments of rice stripe 
virus (RSV). In the present study, a reverse genetic system for RSV in human 
cells and an insect vector, the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus, 
was used to demonstrate that the 3'-terminal extensions suppressed viral 
replication in vector insects by inhibiting promoter activity due to structural 
interference with the panhandle structure formed by viral 3'- and 5'-UTRs. The 
extension sequence in the viral RNA1 segment was targeted by an endogenous 
insect microRNA, miR-263a, which decreased the inhibitory effect of the 
extension sequence on viral promoter activity. Surprisingly, the expression of 
miR-263a was negatively regulated by RSV infection. This elaborate coordination 
between terminal variation of the viral genome and endogenous insect microRNAs 
controls RSV replication in planthopper, thus reflecting a distinct strategy of 
adaptation of phytoviruses to insect vectors.

Australia's local, state, territory and federal governments have agreed that the 
10-year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians 
will be closed by 2031. However, annual Closing the Gap reports tabled by the 
various prime ministers in the Australian Parliament (for the past 12 years) 
have consistently indicated that the life expectancy gap continues to widen. 
Australia has seen more than three decades of government policies since the 
landmark 1989 National Aboriginal health strategy. What has been missing from 
these policy commitments is the genuine enactment of the knowledges that are 
held by Indigenous Australians relating to their cultural ways of being, knowing 
and doing. Privileging Indigenous knowledges, cultures and voices must be front 
and centre in developing, designing and implementing policies and programs. The 
sharing of power, provision of resources, culturally informed reflective policy 
making, and program design are critical elements. In this paper, we provide a 
conceptual model of practice, working at the cultural interface where knowledges 
are valued and innovations can occur. This model of practice is where knowledges 
and cultures can co-exist, and it could be the answer to Closing the Gap in life 
expectancy by 2031. Despite a growing willingness and need to consider these 
models, there remains a deep-seated resistance to identifying and addressing 
institutional and systemic racism and racist attitudes, including unconscious 
biases held by individuals. Further, western non-Indigenous worldviews of ways 
of being, knowing and doing continue to dominate the decisions and actions of 
governments - and consequentially dominate public health policies and practices. 
There is an unacceptable standard approach, for and about Indigenous health 
instead of with Indigenous peoples, resulting in the neglectful dismissal of 
Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous cultures of ways of being, knowing and 
doing.

Advances in the field of solid-organ transplantation (SOT), namely evolution of 
surgical techniques, developments in immunosuppressive therapies and efforts to 
maximize utilization of donor allografts (deceased and living), have resulted in 
growing numbers of SOT performed annually in the United States (U.S.) (36,529 
total organs and 21,167 kidneys transplanted in 2018). However, the Native 
American/American Indian (NA/AI) people of the U.S. experience enormous 
socioeconomic barriers such as poverty, lack of adequate healthcare, poor health 
literacy and geographic isolation which limit access to SOT resulting in low 
rates of organ donation and transplantation, poor quality of life and shorter 
life expectancy. The NA/AI population is at increased risk for end-stage renal 
disease secondary to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus. We review 
existing challenges to kidney transplantation in NA/AI patients and discuss 
potential solutions which could improve equitable delivery of specialized 
healthcare to this underprivileged population.

To evaluate survival and quality of life of octogenarians after surgical aortic 
valve replacement (SAVR), up to 10 year of follow-up. Retrospective 
observational study on octogenarians operated for an isolated or combined SAVR 
in 2 centers between 2005 and 2011. Preoperative data were collected for each 
patient and updated regularly with last follow-up on July 2018. Early 
postoperative course was assessed for all patients. The primary outcome was late 
survival after discharge. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in all 
surviving patients using the Short-Form 12 questionnaire. Nine hundred and nine 
patients were included. The median age was 82 ± 2.6 years, with 400/909 females 
(44%). Isolated AVR was performed in 452/909 patients (49.7%). Early in-hospital 
mortality occurred in 71/909 patients (7.8%). Mean follow-up was 5.9 ± 3.4 
years. Survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in the overall cohort was 89%, 70%, and 
28%, respectively, without significant difference between isolated or combined 
AVR. Survival was significantly higher in patients with a Euroscore <8% (P< 
0.0001). Multivariate analysis found that older age at surgery, diabetes, 
history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and chronic renal failure 
were predictors of long-term mortality. Finally, the SF-12 physical score was 
40.7 ± 10.4 and mental and emotional score was 52.7 ± 8.6 at last follow-up, 
which falls within the expected range for the general population (50 ± 10) with 
comparable age. SAVR remains an effective treatment for aortic valve disease in 
octogenarians, not only increasing life expectancy but also conferring a 
long-standing quality of life with excellent valve durability.

BACKGROUND: According to many conceptual frameworks, the first step in the 
monitoring cycle of health inequalities is the selection of relevant topics and 
indicators. However, some difficulties may arise during this selection process 
due to a high variety of contextual factors that may influence this step. In 
order to help accomplish this task successfully, a comprehensive review of the 
most common topics and indicators for measuring and monitoring health 
inequalities in countries/regions with similar socioeconomic and political 
status as Catalonia was performed.
METHODS: We describe the processes and criteria used for selecting health 
indicators from reports, studies, and databases focusing on health inequalities. 
We also describe how they were grouped into well-known health topics. The topics 
were filtered and ranked by the number of indicators they accounted for.
RESULTS: We found 691 indicators used in the study of health inequalities. The 
indicators were grouped into 120 topics, 34 of which were selected for having 
five indicators or more. Most commonly found topics in the list include "Life 
expectancy", "Infant mortality", "Obesity and overweight (BMI)", "Mortality 
rate", "Regular smokers/tobacco consumption", "Self-perceived health", 
"Unemployment", "Mental well-being", "Cardiovascular disease/hypertension", 
"Socioeconomic status (SES)/material deprivation".
CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of indicators and topics for the study of health 
inequalities exist across different countries and organisations, although there 
are some clear commonalities. Reviewing the use of health indicators is a key 
step to know the current state of the study of health inequalities and may show 
how to lead the way in understanding how to overcome them.

INTRODUCTION: We examined years of potential life lost (YPLL) associated with 
pre-diabetes as compared with either normoglycemia or diabetes, using data of 
the Israel cohort of Glucose intolerance, Obesity and Hypertension 40-year 
follow-up.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Men and women (N=2844, mean age 52.0±8.2 years) who 
underwent oral glucose tolerance test and anthropometric measurements, during 
1976-1982, were followed for mortality until May 2019. Multiple imputation 
procedures for missing mortality dates and multivariable regression mixed models 
were applied.
RESULTS: At baseline, 35.8%, 48.8% and 15.4% individuals were found with 
normoglycemia, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, respectively. The average difference 
in YPLL associated with pre-diabetes as compared with normoglycemia was 4.3 
years (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2; p<0.001). YPLL were 1 year higher in women with 
pre-diabetes than in men with pre-diabetes. These differences persisted mainly 
in individuals younger than 60 years, and those with body mass index (BMI) 
<25 kg/m2, at baseline. Adjusting for age, sex, country of origin, smoking 
status, BMI, and blood pressure, the average difference in YPLL associated with 
pre-diabetes as compared with normoglycemia was 2.0 years (95% CI 1.2 to 2.8; 
p<0.001). Significant reductions of 5.9 years (95% CI 4.8 to 7.0) on average 
were observed for diabetes as compared with pre-diabetes and 7.9 years (95% CI 
6.7 to 9.1) as compared with individuals with normoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that life expectancy of middle-aged individuals 
with pre-diabetes is shorter than of normoglycemic ones. These findings are 
especially relevant in view of the rising worldwide prevalence of pre-diabetes 
within younger age groups and underscore the crucial importance of interventions 
by either lifestyle modification or drug therapy capable of delaying progression 
from pre-diabetes to diabetes to reduce the YPLL in this high-risk group.

OBJECTIVES: Following well-established practices in demography, this article 
discusses several measures based on the number of COVID-19 deaths to facilitate 
comparisons over time and across populations.
SETTINGS: National populations in 186 United Nations countries and territories 
and populations in first-level subnational administrative entities in Brazil, 
China, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: None (death statistics only).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An unstandardised occurrence/exposure 
rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate; an indirectly age-and-sex standardised 
rate that can be derived even when the breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age and 
sex required for direct standardisation is unavailable; the reduction in life 
expectancy at birth corresponding to the 2020 number of COVID-19 deaths.
RESULTS: To date, the highest unstandardised rate has been in New York, at its 
peak exceeding the state 2017 crude death rate. Populations compare differently 
after standardisation: while parts of Italy, Spain and the USA have the highest 
unstandardised rates, parts of Mexico and Peru have the highest standardised 
rates. For several populations with the necessary data by age and sex for direct 
standardisation, we show that direct and indirect standardisation yield similar 
results. US life expectancy is estimated to have declined this year by more than 
a year (-1.26 years), far more than during the worst year of the HIV epidemic, 
or the worst 3 years of the opioid crisis, and to reach its lowest level since 
2008. Substantially larger reductions, exceeding 2 years, are estimated for 
Panama, Peru, and parts of Italy, Spain, the USA and especially, Mexico.
CONCLUSIONS: With lesser demand on data than direct standardisation, indirect 
standardisation is a valid alternative to adjust international comparisons for 
differences in population distribution by sex and age-groups. A number of 
populations have experienced reductions in 2020 life expectancies that are 
substantial by recent historical standards.

Although some studies have assessed the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), there has been 
a lack of nationwide real-world studies estimating life expectancy (LE), 
loss-of-LE, life-years saved, and lifetime medical costs. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of PCI versus non-PCI therapy by integrating a survival 
function and mean-cost function over a lifelong horizon to obtain the 
estimations for AMI patients without major comorbidities. We constructed a 
longitudinal AMI cohort based on the claim database of Taiwan's National Health 
Insurance during 1999-2015. Taiwan's National Mortality Registry Database was 
linked to derive a survival function to estimate LE, loss-of-LE, life-years 
saved, and lifetime medical costs in both therapies. This study enrolled a total 
of 38,441 AMI patients; AMI patients receiving PCI showed a fewer loss-of-LE 
(3.6 versus 5.2 years), and more lifetime medical costs (US$ 49,112 versus US$ 
43,532). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$ 3488 per 
life-year saved. After stratification by age, the AMI patients aged 50-59 years 
receiving PCI was shown to be cost-saving. From the perspective of Taiwan's 
National Health Insurance, PCI is cost-effective in AMI patients without major 
comorbidities. Notably, for patients aged 50-59 years, PCI is cost-saving.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still the leading cause of death 
worldwide, responsible for an estimated 17.8 million deaths globally in 2017, 
accounting for 31.8% of all deaths. In this review, we aim to provide an updated 
overview of CVD burden from an Italian and a global perspective.
METHODS: Crude and age-standardized incidence and prevalence, as well as 
age-standardized mortality rate and morbidity rate (expressed as 
disability-adjusted life years - DALYs), of different cardiovascular conditions, 
derived from the Global Burden of Disease Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 
2017, were reported and compared between Italy and the world.
RESULTS: Crude prevalence of CVD in Italy is nearly twofold higher than global 
prevalence (12.9% vs. 6.6%), while age-standardized estimates are similar (6.2% 
vs. 6.3%). Mortality and morbidity from CVD are reduced in Italy, as compared to 
worldwide estimates (age-standardized mortality rate 113/100,000 vs. 
233/100,000; age-standardized rate of DALYs lost 1764/100,000 vs. 4598/100,000). 
Of the evaluated cardiovascular conditions, the most important CVD burden is due 
to ischemic heart disease, which show a crude prevalence of 3.6% in Italy 
(age-standardized: 1.7%), doubling the corresponding crude global estimate 
(1.7%; age-standardized: 1.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: This latest update on the epidemiology of CVD within Italy and the 
world summarizes the burden of major cardiovascular conditions. CVD, especially 
ischemic heart disease, is still an important cause of mortality and morbidity. 
The impact of increasing life-expectancy is a key determinant of CVD 
epidemiology in Italy, if compared to worldwide data, since older age is one of 
the major risk factors for CVD.

IMPORTANCE: If magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mitigates overdiagnosis of 
prostate cancer while improving the detection of clinically significant cases, 
including MRI in a screening program for prostate cancer could be considered.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefit-harm profiles and cost-effectiveness 
associated with MRI before biopsy compared with biopsy-first screening for 
prostate cancer using age-based and risk-stratified screening strategies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model used a 
life-table approach and was conducted between December 2019 and July 2020. A 
hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years were 
analyzed and followed-up to 90 years of age.
EXPOSURES: No screening, age-based screening, and risk-stratified screening in 
the hypothetical cohort. Age-based screening consisted of screening every 4 
years with prostate-specific antigen between the ages of 55 and 69 years. 
Risk-stratified screening used age and polygenic risk profiles.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The benefit-harm profile (deaths from prostate 
cancer, quality-adjusted life-years, overdiagnosis, and biopsies) and 
cost-effectiveness (net monetary benefit, from a health care system perspective) 
were analyzed. Both age-based and risk-stratified screening were evaluated using 
a biopsy-first and an MRI-first diagnostic pathway. Results were derived from 
probabilistic analyses and were discounted at 3.5% per annum.
RESULTS: The hypothetical cohort included 4.48 million men in England, ranging 
in age from 55 to 69 years (median, 62 years). Compared with biopsy-first 
age-based screening, MRI-first age-based screening was associated with 0.9% 
(1368; 95% uncertainty interval [UI], 1370-1409) fewer deaths from prostate 
cancer, 14.9% (12 370; 95% UI, 11 100-13 670) fewer overdiagnoses, and 33.8% 
(650 500; 95% UI, 463 200-907 000) fewer biopsies. At 10-year absolute risk 
thresholds of 2% and 10%, MRI-first risk-stratified screening was associated 
with between 10.4% (7335; 95% UI, 6630-8098) and 72.6% (51 250; 95% UI, 
46 070-56 890) fewer overdiagnosed cancers, respectively, and between 21.7% 
fewer MRIs (412 100; 95% UI, 411 400-412 900) and 53.5% fewer biopsies 
(1 016 000; 95% UI, 1 010 000-1 022 000), respectively, compared with MRI-first 
age-based screening. The most cost-effective strategies at willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of £20 000 (US $26 000) and £30 000 (US $39 000) per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained were MRI-first risk-stratified screening at 10-year absolute 
risk thresholds of 8.5% and 7.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this decision analytical model of a hypothetical 
cohort, an MRI-first diagnostic pathway was associated with an improvement in 
the benefit-harm profile and cost-effectiveness of screening for prostate cancer 
compared with biopsy-first screening. These improvements were greater when using 
risk-stratified screening based on age and polygenic risk profile and may 
warrant prospective evaluation.

Why do people contribute to the well-being of others? What promotes or hinders 
their contribution? Framed by expectancy-value theory and the motivational 
theory of life span development, we use data from the Midlife in the United 
States National longitudinal study (MIDUS I, II, and III) to examine how 
individuals' perceived contributions to the well-being of others develop across 
adulthood, in the related but distinct forms of overall prosociality (more 
other-focused) and generativity (more self-focused). Our findings show that 
prosociality and generativity display similar, yet distinct trajectories, 
peaking in midlife a decade apart from each other, when expectancy and value for 
prosocial behavior are highest. Moreover, expectancy as reflected in perceived 
control and control strivings, and value as indicated by agreeableness, predict 
individuals' prosociality and generativity. Trajectories of prosocial 
contributions further differ according to individual differences in perceived 
control, control striving, education, income, and number of children, whereas 
trajectories of generativity only differ across levels of perceived control and 
income. By applying motivational and life span developmental perspectives, our 
study offers insight into how prosociality and generativity develop throughout 
adulthood. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

Understanding persistence and changes in prosociality across the life span is 
fundamental to inform theory and practice. As life expectancy increases and 
pressing societal challenges demand increasing generosity and cooperation among 
individuals, it is crucial to understand intergenerational interactions. We 
present the findings from a novel lab-in-the-field experiment (N = 359, 18-90 
years) that examines generosity and cooperation between generations. Our 
methodological approach allows us to study the effect of age on prosocial 
behavior as a function of the age of an unknown partner. We ask participants to 
make several decisions, and to state their expectations for their partners' 
behavior, in a dictator game and a prisoner's dilemma game with real monetary 
outcomes. The dictator game serves as a measure of generosity, whereas the 
prisoner's dilemma serves as a measure of cooperation. We find that individuals 
used age as key information to condition behavior. Generosity was greater among 
older adults in response to young and older relative to middle-aged partners. 
Among younger adults, cooperation was greater in response to middle-aged and 
older partners relative to their own age cohort. All age groups expect less 
cooperation from young partners than from older and middle-aged partners. 
However, relative to young adults, older adults are more cooperative with young 
partners. Our study has crucial implications for the understanding of human 
generosity and cooperation across the life span. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

Evidence about the magnitude of the aflatoxin menace can help policy makers 
appreciate the importance of the problem and strengthen policies to support 
aflatoxin mitigation measures. In this study, we estimated aflatoxin-induced 
liver cancer risk in 2016 for Tanzania and used the information to estimate the 
health burden due to the aflatoxin exposure in the country. The burden of 
aflatoxin-induced liver cancer was assessed based on available aflatoxin 
biomarker data from a previous epidemiology study, hepatitis B virus infection 
prevalence and population size of Tanzania in 2016. The health burden due to 
aflatoxin-induced liver cancer was estimated using disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs). The aflatoxin exposures ranged from 15.0-10,926.0 ng/kg bw/day 
(median, 105.5 ng/kg bw/day). We estimated that in 2016 there were about 1,480 
(2.95 per 100,000 persons) new cases of aflatoxin-induced liver cancer in 
Tanzania and assumed all of them would die within a year. These morbidity and 
mortality rates led to a total loss of about 56,247.63 DALYs. These results 
show, quantitatively, the cases of liver cancer and related deaths that could be 
avoided, and the healthy life years that could be saved, annually, by 
strengthening measures to control aflatoxin contamination in Tanzania.

BACKGROUND: International guidelines state that bone-targeted agents such as 
denosumab or zoledronic acid at doses used for bone metastasis are not indicated 
for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) with 
bone metastases. Whereas denosumab has never been studied in this patient 
population, zoledronic acid has been shown to be ineffective in decreasing the 
risk for skeletal-related events. This study estimates the prevalence and 
economic consequences of real-world use of bone-targeted agents for mCSPC 
patients in Switzerland.
METHODS: To estimate the frequency of bone-targeted agent administration and 
skeletal-related events, data from a non-interventional, cross-sectional survey 
involving oncologists across Switzerland (SAKK 95/16) was combined with data 
from the Swiss National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration 
(NICER). Economic parameters were calculated from the perspective of the 
healthcare system over the median time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
progression for the extrapolated patient group, using data from NICER. The cost 
calculation covered costs for bone-targeted agents, their administration and 
skeletal-related events. The time to PSA progression (33.2 months), as well as 
the probability and cost of skeletal-related events were derived from the 
literature.
RESULTS: The survey was answered by 86 physicians treating 417 patients, of whom 
106 (25.4%) had prostate cancer, with 36 (34.0%) of these mCSPC. The majority of 
mCSPC patients (52.8%, n = 19) received bone-targeted agents monthly. Denosumab 
was the treatment of choice in 84.2% of patients (n = 16). Extrapolation using 
data from NICER indicated that 568 mCSPC patients may be treated with 
bone-targeted agents at doses used for bone metastasis &nbsp;every year in 
Switzerland, leading to estimated total costs of more than CHF 8.3 million over 
33.2 months. Because of its more frequent prescription and higher price, it 
appears that almost 93% of the total costs can be attributed to denosumab. For 
both denosumab and zoledronic acid, the most expensive components were the cost 
of administration and the drug cost, making up more than 90% of the total costs, 
with the rest being costs of skeletal-related events.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the administration of bone-targeted agents in 
doses used for bone-metastatic diseases to prevent skeletal-related events is 
frequent in the setting of mCSPC and results in significant costs for the 
healthcare system.

OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the gap in life expectancy on the municipality of Rome, 
through the spatio-temporal changes in life expectancy at the birth and at 65 
years old of residents in between 2006 and 2017, by gender, socioeconomic 
position, and health district.
DESIGN: epidemiological study based on the construction of mortality tables 
describing age-specific mortality rates and life expectancy at birth and at 65 
years old.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: from the Register of the Causes of Death (ReNCaM), 
between 2006 to 2017, 329,426 deaths of residents in Rome were selected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the variation in life expectancy at birth was estimated 
by gender, by socioeconomic position, and by health district for four triennial 
observation periods from 2006 to 2017. Temporal and socioeconomic position 
changes, through an indicator of deprivation of a small area specific for the 
city of Rome, and possible geographical patterns, by observing the variation in 
the 15 health districts, between 2006 and 2017 were observed.
RESULTS: in Rome, between the first three-year period (2006-2008) and the last 
one (2015-2017), the life expectancy at birth increases, whit a gain of about 
1.5 years among males (from 78.7 to 80.4 years) and just under 1 year among 
females (from 83.6 to 84.4 years). The increase in life expectancy, however, is 
not uniform in the population and the results show differences in socioeconomic 
position that increase in the most recent three years to 4 years for males and 
2.2 years for females. The geographical analysis shows important differences in 
the life expectancy among health districts with differences up to about 3 years 
for males and 2.2 years for females at the beginning of the study period among 
districts in the historical centre and districts on the outskirts of the City of 
Rome, which are reduced to 2.7 years for males and 2.1 years for females in the 
most recent period.
CONCLUSIONS: the analysis of geographical and socioeconomic differences of the 
life expectancy provides important information to identify the areas of the 
Municipality of Rome on which to strengthen prevention interventions and the 
actions to be taken for Objective 10 ("Reducing inequalities") of Agenda 2030 
for sustainable development.

The article is aimed at studying the effects of social, economic, demographic, 
behavioural and environmental factors on the life expectancy of rural people in 
different types of regions. Using cluster analysis, we identified four 
relatively homogeneous groups of Russian regions in terms of life expectancy. 
The impact of socio-economic, demographic and environmental indicators on life 
expectancy of the rural population was assessed using regression models. We 
identified regions with low life expectancy for the rural population, and 
factors that have negative effect on life expectancy at birth. The main ones 
were alcohol abuse, high unemployment and emissions of pollutants into the air. 
The regression analysis showed that investments aimed at the development of 
health care, provision of social services and improvement of residential 
premises contributed to an increase in life expectancy. Significant factors in 
regions with high life expectancy were a lower number of recorded crimes per 
100,000 of the population and a decrease in high unemployment, as well as an 
increase in educational expenses. In the group of regions where life expectancy 
of the rural population was approaching the average level in Russia, an 
important factor was also an increase in the level of education. We conclude 
that a regionally differentiated approach is necessary when introducing social
