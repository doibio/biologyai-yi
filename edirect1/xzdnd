patients with cancer of palliative care and their preferences regarding 
end-of-life care in mainland China.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTING: This study was conducted in a tertiary cancer hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-seven patients with cancer were recruited and 
consented to fill out the questionnaires.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The participants' knowledge and attitudes of palliative care 
and their preferences of end-of-life care involving place of care, place of 
death, truth disclosure and treatments during end-of-life were measured.
RESULTS: In total, 239 questionnaires were valid. The vast majority of patients 
with cancer (81.2%) had never heard about palliative care or related policies, 
and only a few of them (5.8%) had somewhat or totally understanding of 
palliative care. Most participants (75.3%) had supportive attitudes towards 
palliative care. In terms of preferences for end-of-life care, most patients 
with cancer preferred to be cared for at home at the end of their life and to 
die at home. The majority of patients with cancer (65.7%) wanted to know their 
diagnosis or prognosis of the disease, regardless of the type of disease. More 
than half of the participants (54%) wished to improve their quality of life 
rather than prolong their life expectancy. More than a third of the patients 
with cancer preferred to entrust a family member or agent to sign medical 
decision agreements for them.
CONCLUSIONS: It is essential for healthcare providers to improve the 
understanding of patients with cancer of palliative care and be aware of the 
end-of-life care preferences of patients with cancer, in order to provide 
support that enables patients with cancer to receive end-of-life care that is 
accordant with their wishes.

Long term-side effects from cancer therapies are a growing health care concern 
as life expectancy among cancer survivors increases. Damage to the bladder is 
common in patients treated with radiation therapy for pelvic cancers and can 
result in radiation (hemorrhagic) cystitis (RC). The disease progression of RC 
consists of an acute and chronic phase, separated by a symptom-free period. 
Gaining insight in tissue changes associated with these phases is necessary to 
develop appropriate interventions. Using a mouse preclinical model, we have 
previously shown that fibrosis and vascular damage are the predominant 
pathological features of chronic RC. The goal of this study was to determine the 
pathological changes during acute RC. We identified that radiation treatment 
results in a temporary increase in micturition frequency and decrease in void 
volume 4-8 weeks after irradiation. Histologically, the micturition defect is 
associated with thinning of the urothelium, loss of urothelial cell-cell 
adhesion and tight junction proteins and decrease in uroplakin III expression. 
By 12 weeks, the urothelium had regenerated and micturition patterns were 
similar to littermate controls. No inflammation or fibrosis were detected in 
bladder tissues after irradiation. We conclude that functional bladder defects 
during acute RC are driven primarily by a urothelial defect.

Anticancer drugs play an important role in reducing mortality rates and 
increasing life expectancy in cancer patients. Treatments include monotherapy 
and/or a combination of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or 
immunotherapy. Despite great advances in drug development, some of these 
treatments have been shown to induce cardiotoxicity directly affecting heart 
function and structure, as well as accelerating the development of 
cardiovascular disease. Such side effects restrict treatment options and can 
negatively affect disease management. Consequently, when managing cancer 
patients, it is vital to understand the mechanisms causing cardiotoxicity to 
better monitor heart function, develop preventative measures against 
cardiotoxicity, and treat heart failure when it occurs in this patient 
population. This review discusses the role and mechanism of major chemotherapy 
agents with principal cardiovascular complications in cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: African Americans have poorer cardiovascular health and higher 
chronic disease mortality than non-Hispanic whites. The high burden of chronic 
diseases among African Americans is a primary cause of disparities in life 
expectancy between African Americans and whites.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study via a postal survey among a sample 
of 65 male, African American patients aged ≥ 40 years. The overall objective was 
to examine the frequency of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, 
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, asthma, emphysema, and 
cancer among patients treated at Augusta University Health.
RESULTS: A high percentage of study participants (81.5 %) reported a history of 
high blood pressure; 50.8% had high cholesterol; 44.3% were overweight, 44.3% 
were obese, and 13.9% were current cigarette smokers. About 36.9% of the men had 
a reported history of diabetes; 10.8% of the men had a history of heart attack, 
13.9% had a history of congestive heart failure, 9.2% had a history of stroke, 
and 15.4% had a history of prostate cancer. Men who reported a personal history 
of prostate cancer were significantly more likely to have a history of heart 
attack and stroke and to be overweight (p < 0.05 in each instance).
DISCUSSION: Additional studies are needed of cardiovascular risk factors and 
adverse cardiovascular events among African American men, and interventional 
research aimed at controlling hypertension. Of particular concern is prostate 
cancer, and whether patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and 
diabetes are receiving appropriate therapy to reduce their cardiovascular risk 
and prevent morbidity and mortality from adverse cardiovascular events.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with early-stage NSCLC typically must choose between a 
surgery with superior local control (lobectomy) or one that preserves lung 
parenchyma (wedge). Recognizing that many patients with cancer have competing 
mortality risks unrelated to cancer, we investigated whether an established 
model of predicting life expectancy could be used to identify patients with 
stage I NSCLC for whom survival after wedge is not different from lobectomy.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Institute's 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare was performed to evaluate 
survival among treatment-naive patients, diagnosed 2005-2015, who underwent 
lobectomy or wedge for stage I (≤2 cm tumors) NSCLC. Comorbidity-related life 
expectancy (CR-LE) was estimated using a standard life-table approach based on 
comorbid conditions, sex, and age. Cox models and perioperative complications 
were stratified by 5-year CR-LE.
RESULTS: A total of 4560 patients (median age 74, interquartile range 70-78) 
were identified. CR-LE was greater than or equal to 5 years for 4016 patients 
(wedge = 23%). CR-LE was less than 5 years for 544 patients (wedge = 41%). Among 
patients with CR-LE greater than or equal to 5, wedge resection was associated 
with higher risk of mortality than lobectomy (hazard ratio: 1.68, 95% confidence 
interval: 1.52-1.86, p < 0.001). For those with CR-LE less than 5, there was no 
significant difference in mortality risk between lobectomy and wedge (hazard 
ratio: 1.19, 95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.47; p = 0.11). CR-LE less than five 
patients who underwent a lobectomy had higher 90-day mortality compared with 
wedge (9% versus 4%, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: The survival advantage of lobectomy over wedge for stage I NSCLC 
seems to dissipate among patients with shorter life expectancy owing to age and 
comorbidities. Wedge resection may be a reasonable option for patients at high 
risk of dying from non-cancer-related causes.

Psoriasis is thought to be associated with a reduced life expectancy through 
systemic inflammation. A comparative, retrospective analysis of 
neutrophil-to-lympho-cyte ratio, a biomarker of systemic inflammation and 
cardiovascular risk, under 196 treatments with tumour necrosis factor-α and 
interleukin-12/23 antagonists was performed. Neutrophil-to-lympho-cyte ratio 
decreased significantly within 3 months of initiation of treatment and remained 
stable at reduced levels for at least 33 months. Dynamics were more pronounced 
and neutrophil-to-lympho-cyte ratio under treatment was lower in patients 
treated with tumour necrosis factor-α compared with interleukin-12/23 
antagonists (geometric mean (95% confidence interval): 2.03 (1.9, 2.1) vs 2.63 
(2.2, 3.2), respectively, p = 0.014). tumour necrosis factor-α antagonist 
treatment and baseline neutrophil-to-lympho-cyte ratio were independent 
predictors of a median low cardiovascular risk neutrophil-to-lympho-cyte ratio 
(< 2.15) during treatment (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.53 (0.4-0.8) 
and 4.68 (1.0-19.1), p = 0.001 and p = 0.032, respectively). These results 
demonstrate a rapid and sustained reduction in biomarkers of systemic 
inflammation under biologic treatment. Furthermore, these data suggest 
class-specific effects on systemic inflammation, which may be relevant for the 
prevention of psoriasis co-morbidity by systemic treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the care and support needs in ageing with 
neuromuscular disease from a patient-user perspective.
BACKGROUND: The term neuromuscular disease covers several chronic hereditary or 
acquired disease subtypes. In the developed countries, advances in symptoms 
management, technical advancements and rehabilitation initiatives have resulted 
in increased life expectancy for some subtypes. Life with neuromuscular disease 
is thus likely to continue into adulthood and old age. However, knowledge of the 
care and support needs of patients ageing with neuromuscular disease remains 
sparse.
DESIGN: Adopting a user-participatory approach embedded in a phenomenological 
hermeneutic tradition, we conducted two user-group discussions focusing on care 
and support needs in people ageing with neuromuscular disease. Twenty-five users 
with neuromuscular disease participated in the group discussions. Data were 
analysed using a three-stepped analysis method inspired by the French 
Philosopher Paul Ricoeur. In the analysis process, dialectical movements between 
a surface interpretation and an in-depth understanding occur. The COREQ 
checklist was used to report the study.
RESULTS: Two themes were identified; 'Changes in the sheltering relationships of 
life require preparation' and 'Ageing introduces a dichotomy between 
circumstantial normalcy and minority groupness'. An understanding of care and 
support needs in life with neuromuscular disease was reached revealing a need 
for a lifeworld-led approach.
CONCLUSION: Persons ageing with neuromuscular disease crave a fusion of disease- 
and age-led care and support. This fusion may be achieved through the 
introduction of a lifeworld-led approach to care and support.
RELEVANCE FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Unmet care and support needs in people ageing 
with neuromuscular disease may result in patients experiencing fear and concern 
about their life situation. Healthcare professionals may play a crucial role in 
creating coherent lives for these persons if they understand the approach 
proposed herein to uncover the care and support needs in people ageing with 
neuromuscular disease.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is increasingly perceived as a terminal illness due to 
disease progression with a shortened life expectancy and often a lack of 
therapeutic options. In the context of palliative care, the preferred place of 
death is considered a quality indicator for needs-based patient care. The aim of 
this study was to describe the distribution of places of death of older patients 
with dementia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Death certificates from the years 2001, 2011 and 2017 were 
evaluated from the most comprehensive study on places of death in Germany to 
date, conducted in selected regions of Westphalia. Medical information on the 
cause of death was also analyzed. In this way, deceased patients with dementia 
≥ 65 years (ICD-10: F01, F02, F03, G30) were identified and the distribution of 
their places of death statistically determined.
RESULTS: Dementia was present in 4720 out of 31,631 (14.9%; 95% CI: 14.5-15.3%) 
deceased patients ≥ 65 years. The distribution of places of death was as follows 
(%; age-standardized; 2001/2011/2017): home environment 24.0/19.7/15.8, hospital 
40.4/29.0/24.3, palliative care unit 0.0/0.3/1.8, hospice 0.4/0.9/0.9, nursing 
home 35.2/49.5/57.1 and other places 0.0/0.0/0.0.
CONCLUSION: The majority of older patients (≥ 65 years) with dementia die in 
nursing homes, followed by hospitals and the home environment. Palliative care 
units and hospices play a subordinate role as places of death for patients with 
dementia.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Die Demenz wird aufgrund ihres 
progredienten Krankheitsverlaufes mit verkürzter Lebenserwartung und oft 
fehlender therapeutischer Möglichkeit einer Kuration zunehmend als terminale 
Erkrankung wahrgenommen. Im palliativmedizinischen Kontext gilt der präferierte 
Sterbeort als Qualitätsindikator für eine bedarfsgerechte Patientenversorgung. 
Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, die Verteilung des Sterbeortes für ältere 
Menschen mit einer demenziellen Erkrankung zu beschreiben.
MATERIAL UND METHODE: Datengrundlage bildeten ausgewertete Todesbescheinigungen 
der Jahre 2001, 2011, 2017 der bis dato umfangreichsten Sterbeortstudie in 
Deutschland, die in ausgewählten Regionen Westfalens durchgeführt wurde. 
Ärztliche Angaben zur Todesursache wurden miterfasst. So konnten Verstorbene 
≥ 65 Jahre mit einer Demenzerkrankung (ICD-10: F01, F02, F03, G30) identifiziert 
und deren Sterbeort deskriptiv dargestellt werden.
ERGEBNISSE: Eine Demenzerkrankung lag bei Verstorbenen ≥ 65 Jahre (n = 31.631) 
in 14,9 % [95 %-KI: 14,5–15,3 %] der Fälle vor. Es ergab sich folgende 
Sterbeortverteilung (%, altersstandardisiert; 2001/2011/2017): häusliches Umfeld 
24,0/19,7/15,8; Krankenhaus 40,4/29,0/24,3; Palliativstation 0,0/0,3/1,8; Hospiz 
0,4/0,9/0,9; Pflegeheim 35,2/49,5/57,1; sonstiger Ort 0,0/0,0/0,0.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Ältere Menschen (≥ 65 Jahre) mit Demenz versterben 
mehrheitlich im Pflegeheim, gefolgt vom Krankenhaus und vom häuslichen Umfeld. 
Palliativstationen und Hospize spielen als Sterbeorte bei diesen Personen eine 
untergeordnete Rolle.

BACKGROUND: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to 
identify QTLs underlying quantitative traits in humans and animals, and they 
have also become a popular method of mapping QTLs in many crops, including 
maize. Advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies enable construction 
of high-density linkage maps using SNP markers.
OBJECTIVES: High-density genetic mapping must precede to find molecular markers 
associated with a particular trait. The objectives of this study were to (1) 
construct a high-density linkage map using SNP markers and (2) detect the QTLs 
for grain yield and quality related traits of the Mo17/KW7 RIL population.
METHODS: In this study, two parental lines, Mo17 (normal maize inbred line) and 
KW7 (waxy inbred line) and 80 F7:8 lines in the Mo17/KW7 RIL population were 
genotyped using the MaizeSNP50 BeadChip, an Illumina BeadChip array of 56,110 
maize SNPs. Marker integration and detection of QTLs was performed using the 
inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method within the QTL IciMapping 
software.
RESULTS: This study was genotyped using the Illumina MaizeSNP50 BeadChip for 
maize Mo17/KW7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. The 2904 SNP markers 
were distributed along all 10 maize chromosomes. The total length of the linkage 
map was 3553.7 cm, with an average interval of 1.22 cm between SNPs. A total of 
18 QTLs controlling eight traits were detected in the Mo17/KW7 RIL population. 
Three QTLs for plant height (PH) were detected on chromosomes 4 and 8 and showed 
from 16.01% (qPH8) to 19.85% (qPH4a) of phenotypic variance. Five QTLs related 
to ear height (EH) were identified on chromosomes 3, 4, and 6 and accounted for 
3.79% (qEH6) to 27.57% (qEH4b) of phenotypic variance. Five QTLs related to 
water content (WC) on chromosomes 1, 4, 8, and 9 accounted for 9.55% (qWC8b) to 
23.30% (qWC4) of phenotypic variance. One QTL (qAC9) relating to amylose content 
(AC) on chromosome 9 showed 82.10% of phenotypic variance.
CONCLUSIONS: The high-density linkage map and putative QTLs of the maize RIL 
population detected in this study can be effectively utilized in waxy and normal 
maize breeding programs to facilitate the selection process through 
marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding programs.

PURPOSE: To map the magnitudes and temporal trends of chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) along with its attributable risk factors, providing the essential 
foundation for targeted public policies at the national, regional, and global 
levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved annual data on CML burden in 204 countries 
and regions from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 in 1990-2019. The 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the 
temporal trends of CML burden by region, sex, and age group.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence rate of CML declined weakly 
over the past few years (EAPC: -1.04), but the number of incident cases 
increased by 54.1% to 65.8 × 103 in 2019. By contrast, a dramatic drop in death 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate (EAPCs: -2.55; -2.69) led to a 
reduction in deaths and DALYs, especially in high-income regions. In 2019, the 
highest age-standardized death rate was observed in Ethiopia (1.89 per 100,000). 
The death rate of CML was pronounced among the population age above 70 years. 
DALYs of CML worldwide were primarily attributable to smoking (12.2%), high body 
mass index (5.0%), occupational exposure to benzene (0.9%), and occupational 
exposure to formaldehyde (0.3%) in 2019.
CONCLUSION: Although the mortality rate of CML has decreased significantly, the 
management of patients with CML cannot be neglected, especially in elders and 
developing regions.

BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a 2- to 3-fold 
greater risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than patients without IBD, with 
increased risk during hospitalization that persists postdischarge. We determined 
the cost-effectiveness of postdischarge VTE prophylaxis among hospitalized 
patients with IBD.
METHODS: A decision tree compared inpatient prophylaxis alone vs 4 weeks of 
postdischarge VTE prophylaxis with 10 mg/day of rivaroxaban. Our primary outcome 
was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 1 year, and strategies were 
compared using a willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY from a societal 
perspective. Costs (in 2020 $USD), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
and number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 VTE and VTE death were calculated. 
Deterministic 1-way and probabilistic analyses assessed model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Prophylaxis with rivaroxaban resulted in 1.68-higher QALYs per 1000 
persons compared with no postdischarge prophylaxis at an incremental cost of 
$185,778 per QALY. The NNT to prevent a single VTE was 78, whereas the NNT to 
prevent a single VTE-related death was 3190. One-way sensitivity analyses showed 
that higher VTE risk >4.5% and decreased cost of rivaroxaban ≤$280 can reduce 
the ICER to <$100,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses favored 
prophylaxis in 28.9% of iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Four weeks of postdischarge VTE prophylaxis results in higher QALYs 
compared with inpatient prophylaxis alone and prevents 1 postdischarge VTE among 
78 patients with IBD. Although postdischarge VTE prophylaxis for all patients 
with IBD is not cost-effective, it should be considered in a case-by-case 
scenario, considering VTE risk profile, costs, and patient preference.

INTRODUCTION: Improvements in haemophilia treatment over the last decades 
resulted in increased life expectancy in persons with haemophilia (PWH).
AIM: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine all-cause 
mortality and causes of death among PWH.
METHODS: We systematically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and 
Cochrane central register of controlled trials from inception through March 15, 
2021. Studies that reported a mortality estimate of PWH compared with the 
general population and/or reported causes of death were included. Random-effects 
meta-analysis with inverse variance method was used to obtain pooled estimates. 
We stratified the analysis by the year of cohort entry (before 2000 vs after 
2000).
RESULT: Of the 4769 studies identified, 52 met the eligibility criteria. The 
pooled all-cause standardized mortality ratio (SMR) from 9 studies in PWH was 
1.93 (95% CI 1.38-2.70; I2 = 97%). The pooled SMRs before and after the year 
2000 were 2.40 (95% CI 1.92-3.00; I2 = 87%) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.03-1.40; I2 = 
62%), respectively. Before the year 2000, 31.2% deaths occurred due to HIV 
followed by haemorrhage (26.0%), cardiovascular disease (18.2%), liver disease 
(9.0%), and cancer (8.9%). Fewer (13.9%) deaths were attributable to HIV after 
the year 2000 with the proportion of deaths due to haemorrhage remaining 
unchanged.
CONCLUSION: With treatment advances, mortality in PWH has declined over the last 
few decades approaching that of the general population. However, haemorrhage 
remains a leading cause of death requiring further attention.

BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancers are aggressive, rare, gastrointestinal 
malignancies with a poor prognosis; approximately half of patients with these 
cancers survive for less than 1 year after diagnosis with advanced disease. We 
aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab or merestinib in 
addition to first-line cisplatin-gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic biliary tract cancer.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study at 81 hospitals across 
18 countries. We enrolled patients with histologically or cytologically 
confirmed, non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract 
adenocarcinoma, who were treatment-naive, aged 18 years or older, with an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, estimated life 
expectancy of 3 months or more, and measurable disease per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Eligible participants were randomly 
assigned (2:1:2:1) to receive either intravenous ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo 
(on days 1 and 8 in 21-day cycles) or oral merestinib 80 mg or placebo (once 
daily) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or patient or 
investigator request for discontinuation. All participants received intravenous 
cisplatin 25 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (on days 1 and 8 in 21-day 
cycles), for a maximum of eight cycles. Randomisation was done by an interactive 
web response system using a permuted block method (blocks of six) and was 
stratified by primary tumour site, geographical region, and presence of 
metastatic disease. Participants, investigators, and the study funder were 
masked to treatment assignment within the intravenous and oral groups. The 
primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (in the 
intention-to-treat population). The safety analysis was done in all patients who 
received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02711553, and long-term follow-up is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between May 25, 2016, and Aug 8, 2017, 450 patients were assessed for 
eligibility and 309 (69%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to ramucirumab 
(n=106), merestinib (n=102), or pooled placebo (n=101); 306 received at least 
one dose of study treatment. The median follow-up time for progression-free 
survival at data cutoff (Feb 16, 2018) was 10·9 months (IQR 8·1-14·1). Median 
progression-free survival was 6·5 months (80% CI 5·7-7·1) in the ramucirumab 
group, 7·0 months (6·2-7·1) in the merestinib group, and 6·6 months (5·6-6·8) in 
the pooled placebo group (ramucirumab vs placebo hazard ratio 1·12 [80% CI 
0·90-1·40], two-sided stratified p=0·48; merestinib vs placebo 0·92 [0·73-1·15], 
two-sided stratified p=0·64). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events 
were neutropenia (51 [49%] of 104 patients in the ramucirumab group; 48 [47%] of 
102 in the merestinib group; and 33 [33%] of 100 in the pooled placebo group), 
thrombocytopenia (36 [35%]; 19 [19%]; and 17 [17%]), and anaemia (28 [27%]; 16 
[16%]; and 19 [19%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 53 (51%) patients in 
the ramucirumab group, 56 (55%) in the merestinib group, and 48 (48%) in the 
pooled placebo group. Treatment-related deaths (deemed related by the 
investigator) occurred in one (1%) of 104 patients in the ramucirumab group 
(cardiac arrest) and two (2%) of 102 patients in the merestinib group (pulmonary 
embolism [n=1] and sepsis [n=1]).
INTERPRETATION: Adding ramucirumab or merestinib to first-line 
cisplatin-gemcitabine was well tolerated, with no new safety signals, but 
neither improved progression-free survival in patients with molecularly 
unselected, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer. The role of 
these targeted inhibitors remains investigational, highlighting the need for 
further understanding of biliary tract malignancies and the contribution of 
molecular selection.

BACKGROUND: The risk of instability, dislocation, and revision following total 
hip arthroplasty (THA) is increased in patients with abnormal spinopelvic 
mobility. Seated and standing lateral lumbar spine imaging can identify patients 
with stiff/hypermobile spine (SHS) to guide interventions such as changes in 
acetabular cup placement or use of a dual-mobility hip construct aimed at 
reducing dislocation risk.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was created to compare routine preoperative 
spinal imaging (PSI) to no screening in patients with and without SHS. Screened 
patients with SHS were assumed to receive dual-mobility hardware while those 
without SHS and nonscreened patients were assumed to receive conventional THA. 
Cost-effectiveness was determined by estimating the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. Effectiveness measured as quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), with $100,000 per additional QALY as the threshold for 
cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the 
robustness of the base-case result.
RESULTS: The screening strategy with PSI had a lifetime cost of $12,515 and QALY 
gains of 16.91 compared with no-screening ($13,331 and 16.77). The PSI strategy 
reached cost-effectiveness at 5 years and was dominant (ie, less costly and more 
effective) at 11 years following THA. In sensitivity analyses, PSI remained the 
dominant strategy if prevalence of SHS was >1.9%, the cost of PSI was <$925, and 
the cost of dual-mobility hardware exceeded the cost of conventional hardware by 
<$2850.
CONCLUSION: Screening patients for SHS prior to THA with PSI is both less costly 
and more effective and should be considered as part of standard presurgical 
workup.

Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are significantly related to 
quality of life and mortality among individuals with heart disease. However, few 
reports have examined IADL in persons with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary 
hypertension (CTEPH). The aim of this study was to clarify factors related to 
IADL in persons with CTEPH. This retrospective, observational study enrolled 163 
persons with CTEPH (mean ± standard deviation age = 65 ± 13 years; 68% female) 
admitted to the Department of Cardiology at Keio University Hospital between 
January 2015 and July 2019. The Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) was used to 
assess IADL. Age, sex, body mass index, World Health Organization functional 
class (WHO-FC), cardiac function (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean right 
atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac index), 
pulmonary function (percentage vital capacity, percentage forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s, diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO)/alveolar volume 
(VA)), physical function (knee extension strength and walking speed), and 6-min 
walking distance (6MWD) were assessed. Multiple regression analysis was 
performed to identify factors significantly associated with FAI. Mean FAI was 25 
± 8. Univariate analysis showed that sex, WHO-FC, DLCO/VA, walking speed, and 
6MWD were correlated with FAI. Multiple regression analysis showed that 6MWD (sβ 
= 0.338, 95% CI 0.014-0.034, p < .001), sex (sβ = 0.268, 95% CI 2.238-7.165, p < 
.001), and DLCO/VA (sβ = 0.257, 95% CI 1.011-3.528, p < .001) were significantly 
correlated with FAI (R2 = 0.261). IADL were associated with exercise tolerance, 
sex, and DLCO/VA in persons with CTEPH. In the future, more details of IADL are 
expected to be clarified by analyzing individual components of IADL and 
investigating social background characteristics, including living environment.

BACKGROUND: Japan has the largest population of older adults in the world; it is 
only growing as life expectancy increases worldwide. As such, solutions to 
potential obstacles must be studied to maintain healthy, productive lives for 
older adults. In 2011, the Japanese government has started a policy to increase 
"Elderly Housing with Care Services (EHCS)", which is one of a private rental 
housing, as a place where safe and secure end-of-life care can be provided. The 
government expect for them to provide end-of-life care by collaborating with the 
Home-Visit Nursing Agencies (HVNA). The purpose of this study is to clarify the 
situation of the end-of-life care provision in EHCS in collaboration with HVNA 
and to examine the factors that associate with the provision of the end-of-life 
care in EHCS.
METHODS: A two-stage nationwide survey (fax and mail surveys) were conducted. Of 
the 5,172 HVNA of the National Association for Visiting Nurse Services members, 
members from 359 agencies visited EHCS. Logistic regression analysis was 
conducted with the provision of end-of-life care to EHCS in 2017 as the 
dependent variable, and the following as independent variables: characteristics 
of HVNA and EHCS; characteristics of residents; collaborations between HVNA and 
EHCS; and the reasons for starting home-visit nursing.
RESULTS: Of the 342 HVNA who responded to the collaborations with EHCS, 21.6% 
provided end-of-life care. The following factors were significantly associated 
with the provision of end-of-life care to inmates in elderly care facilities: 
being affiliated with a HVNA, admitting many residents using long-term care 
insurance, collaborating with each other for more than three years, and started 
visiting-nurse services after being requested by a resident's physician.
CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the situation of the provision of end-of-life 
care in EHCS in collaboration with HVNA and the related factors that help in 
providing end-of-life care in EHCS.

OBJECTIVES: Although many reviews of the literature on cost-effectiveness 
thresholds (CETs) exist, the availability of new studies and the absence of a 
fully comprehensive analysis warrant a new review. This study systematically 
reviews demand-side methods for estimating the societal monetary value of health 
gain.
METHODS: Several electronic databases were searched from inception to October 
2019. To be included, a study had to be an original article in any language, 
with a clearly described method for estimating the societal monetary values of 
health gain and with all estimated values reported. Estimates were converted to 
US dollars ($), using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and the gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita (2019).
RESULTS: We included 53 studies; 45 used direct approach and 8 used indirect 
approach. Median estimates from the direct approach were PPP$ 24 942 (range 
554-1 301 912) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), which were typically 0.53 
(range 0.02-24.08) GDP per capita. Median estimates using the indirect approach 
were PPP$ 310 051 (range 36 402-7 574 870) per QALY, which accounted for 7.87 
(range 0.68-116.95) GDP per capita.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that the societal values of health gain or CETs 
were less than GDP per capita. The great variety in methods and estimates 
suggests that a more standardized and internationally agreed methodology for 
estimating CET is warranted. Multiple CETs may have a role when QALYs are not 
equally valued from a societal perspective (eg, QALYs accruing to people near 
death compared with equivalent QALYs to others).
