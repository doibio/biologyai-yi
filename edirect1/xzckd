Ulcerative proctitis is defined as a mucosal inflammation limited to the rectum. 
Ulcerative proctitis is responsible for distressing symptoms and alteration of 
patient quality of life. Effective treatment is important to prevent or delay 
proximal extension of the disease and to improve quality of life. Refractory 
ulcerative proctitis is defined as the failure of topical and oral 
5-aminosalicylic acid and corticosteroids. Medical management of refractory 
ulcerative proctitis may be challenging as there is little evidence regarding 
drug efficacy in this clinical situation. Data are currently available for 
azathioprine, topical tacrolimus and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies as rescue 
treatment for refractory ulcerative proctitis. Other biologics may be of benefit 
despite a lack of dedicated clinical trials. Ultimately, experimental therapies 
such as epidermal growth factor enemas, appendectomy or fecal transplantation 
may be tried before restorative proctocolectomy with J pouch anastomosis, which 
has demonstrated good results with regards to clinical remission and quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) offers high conformality and 
ability to dose-escalate skull base chordomas, with promising clinical data. 
However, it is an imperative measure to economically justify the use of such 
high-priced new technologies. Herein, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of 
CIRT compared to photon radiotherapy (PRT) using 10-year outcome data 
extrapolated to a 34-year time frame.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding costs of PRT, as well as 10-year outcomes 
were obtained from published sources. Corresponding figures for CIRT were 
acquired from institutional and published sources. Adjustment was made in order 
to compare both cost figures, including elimination of additional financing and 
follow-up, so that only direct costs of treatment and the cost of progression 
were compared between both modalities. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was calculated as the difference in cost between both modalities divided 
by the difference in 34-year quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) outcomes. The 
annual gross domestic product per capita cost-effectiveness threshold definition 
(as recommended by the WHO) was employed.
RESULTS: The total cost of a complete course of CIRT (20-22 fractions) was 
€31,538.21. After removal of financing and follow-up costs, the adjusted direct 
cost of CIRT utilized for comparison was €18,957.78. In a previous publication, 
the cost of PRT was €4,700.00. ICERs were based upon these direct cost figures 
and the average of reported 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) values with 
PRT (41.1%) and CIRT (54%), as well as gained PFS years (10.66 years CIRT, 8.58 
years PRT). QALYs were 6.65 for photon RT and 8.26 for CIRT, a difference of 
1.61 discounted lifetime QALYs for patients treated with CIRT. The overall ICER 
was €8,855.76/QALY. If the cost of progression/recurrence treated with imatinib 
were included into the calculation, the total ICER was €170.61/QALY.
CONCLUSION: CIRT is a highly cost-effective option to treat chordoma.

The life expectancy for pancreatic cancer patients has seen no substantial 
changes in the last 40 years as very few and mostly just palliative treatments 
are available. As the five years survival rate remains around 5%, the 
identification of novel pharmacological targets and development of new 
therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Here we demonstrate that inhibition 
of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55, using genetic and pharmacological 
approaches, reduces pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and we 
propose that this may represent a novel strategy to inhibit pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. Specifically, we show that genetic ablation 
of Gpr55 in the KRASWT/G12D/TP53WT/R172H/Pdx1-Cre+/+ (KPC) mouse model of PDAC 
significantly prolonged survival. Importantly, KPC mice treated with a 
combination of the GPR55 antagonist Cannabidiol (CBD) and gemcitabine (GEM, one 
of the most used drugs to treat PDAC), survived nearly three times longer 
compared to mice treated with vehicle or GEM alone. Mechanistically, knockdown 
or pharmacologic inhibition of GPR55 reduced anchorage-dependent and independent 
growth, cell cycle progression, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) signalling and protein levels of ribonucleotide reductases in PDAC cells. 
Consistent with this, genetic ablation of Gpr55 reduced proliferation of tumour 
cells, MAPK signalling and ribonucleotide reductase M1 levels in KPC mice. 
Combination of CBD and GEM inhibited tumour cell proliferation in KPC mice and 
it opposed mechanisms involved in development of resistance to GEM in vitro and 
in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the tumour suppressor p53 regulates GPR55 
protein expression through modulation of the microRNA miR34b-3p. Our results 
demonstrate the important role played by GPR55 downstream of p53 in PDAC 
progression. Moreover our data indicate that combination of CBD and GEM, both 
currently approved for medical use, might be tested in clinical trials as a 
novel promising treatment to improve PDAC patients' outcome.

AIM: The aim of this paper was to present a 65 year old female patient with 
chronic heart disease, surgically treated for congenital heart defect type 
Tetralogy of Fallot.
CASE REPORT: In the sixth year of life the patient underwent palliative Potts 
anastomosis surgery which created an anastomosis between the left pulmonary 
artery and the descending aorta. Total correction was made in 34 years of life, 
six months after catheterization, which indicated malignant pulmonary 
hypertension. She is regularly followed up by the cardiologists and receives 
daily therapy. The present state of the patient is satisfactory with 
cardiomegaly, light left ventricular dysfunction, moderate mitral and tricuspid 
regurgitation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and aneurysmatic dilatation of 
left pulmonary artery as well as atrial fibrillation.
CONCLUSION: The intense development of cardiology and cardiac surgery in the USA 
in children and adults over the last fifty years has led to the extension and 
improvement of the quality of life.

Technology (NTNU) Trondheim Norway.

AIM: The aim of this study was to explore any differences between nurses working 
in nursing home and home-based care in their experiences regarding relatives' 
ability to accept the imminence of death and relatives' ability to reach 
agreement when deciding on behalf of patients unable to consent.
DESIGN: An electronic questionnaire-based cross-sectional study.
METHOD: An electronically distributed survey to 884 nurses in long-term care in 
Norway in May 2014. A total of 399 nurses responded (45%), of which 197 worked 
in nursing homes and 202 in home-based care.
RESULTS: Nurses in home-based care, more often than their colleagues in nursing 
homes, experienced that relatives had difficulties in accepting that patients 
were dying. Nurses who often felt insecure about whether life extension was in 
consistency with patients' wishes and nurses who talked most about 
life-prolonging medical treatment in communication with relatives more often 
experienced that relatives being reluctant to accept a poor prognosis and 
disagreements between relatives in their role as proxy decision makers for the 
patient.

Herpes zoster vaccine: a protection for the elderly.

Di Pietro A(1), Facciolà A(1), Visalli G(1).

Functional Images, University of Messina, Italy.

The Herpes Zoster vaccine is strongly recommended by the World Health 
Organization to promote healthy aging by preventing the corresponding age- 
related disease, also named shingles. The disease is due to the endogenous 
reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus, the causal agent of chickenpox, that 
becomes latent at the peripheral nervous system level. Here, owing to the host's 
cell-mediated immunity, it may be confined for several decades. However, the 
immune senescence allows the possibility of virus reactivation, causing the 
onset of neuropathic pain and skin rash that characterize the acute disease. 
Sometimes, the neuralgia becomes chronic causing postherpetic neuralgia that has 
a significant impact on the quality of patient life, analogously to the 
ophthalmic HZ, a particularly feared form of disease. Due to the causal 
relationship between decreasing immune defenses and virus reactivation with 
disease onset, the incidence of Herpes Zoster, in Italy now equal to 6.42 
(95%CI: 5.93-6.95) cases per 1,000 people per year will increase steadily in the 
future due to the longevity rise of the population. Considering epidemiological 
impact, complications and sequelae in the short- and long-term, costs of 
clinical-therapeutical management of patients, and, above all, the poor 
effectiveness of available therapy the only effective intervention is 
vaccination of the elderly. Currently in the European Union, there is only one 
vaccine for Herpes Zoster prevention, formed by live attenuated OKA-Merck virus 
strain that is also used for paediatric vaccine. According to the Health 
Technology Assessment surveys, the intervention cost (based on "Quality Adjusted 
Life Years") is clearly below the discriminating threshold value to judge the 
feasibility and, as predicted by the Italian National Plan of Vaccinal 
Prevention 2017-2019, the vaccine is offered free to all subjects >65 years.

The Klotho protein is a recently discovered protein and its overexpression is 
associated with life extension. Klotho deficiency or silencing of the Klotho 
gene in mice leads to an accelerated aging and short life, whereas 
overexpression of Klotho in mice extends lifespan. Klotho participates in many 
metabolic pathways and is highly expressed in the kidneys, the choroid plexus 
and neurons. It plays a key role in the calcium-phosphate metabolism, 
remyelination, and cognitive processes. The present paper is a short review of 
the literature on the role of Klotho in neurodegenerative disorders, with 
special attention paid to multiple sclerosis. The neuroprotective function of 
Klotho is also reported. It is also important to consider potential clinical 
applications of Klotho that might be useful in the treatment of many diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Recommendations vary on postpolypectomy surveillance, and no 
consensus has been reached even regarding the necessity of risk stratification 
based on polyp characteristics for surveillance. We examined an optimal 
postpolypectomy surveillance program by performing a cost-effectiveness 
analysis.
METHODS: We performed a Markov model analysis using parameters based on Japanese 
data and evaluated four postpolypectomy surveillance programs with respect to 
their effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
cost-effectiveness and required number of colonoscopies. Two were 
non-risk-stratified programs with 1-year (program 1) and 3-year (program 2) 
postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopy, and the other two were risk-stratified 
programs. In program 3, surveillance colonoscopy was performed 3, 10 and 
10 years after resection of advanced adenomas, low-risk adenomatous polyps, and 
no polyps, respectively. In program 4, those intervals were shortened to 1, 3 
and 5 years, respectively.
RESULTS: Risk-stratified programs (3 and 4) yielded higher QALYs with lower 
costs than non-risk-stratified programs (1 and 2). Program 4 yielded higher 
QALYs (23.046) and lower required cost (107,717 JPY) than program 3. The 
required number of colonoscopies for program 4 was 1.2, 1.5 and 1.6 times that 
for programs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
showed that the probability of program 4 being chosen as the most cost-effective 
was highest.
CONCLUSIONS: After polypectomy, risk-stratified colonoscopy surveillance based 
on the polyp characteristics should be considered. A risk-stratified program 
with relatively short examination intervals could be effective and 
cost-effective in Japan, although further investigation and consideration of 
colonoscopy capacity are required.

Sciences, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor,

PEG-functionalized nanoparticles as carriers of chemotherapeutics agents have 
been explored with notable successes in preclinical and clinical stages of 
cancer treatment, with some already approved by FDA, namely PEGylated liposomes 
and polymers. Half-life extension of therapeutic agents through PEGylation 
process improves their pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, thereby reducing their 
dosing frequency. Protein corona composition of PEGylated nanoparticles (NPs) 
confers a tremendous influence on their surface characteristics which directly 
impact tumor accumulation and clearance properties of the drugs. By controlling 
the size and complexity of PEG molecules, as well as by attaching targeting 
moieties, the surface characteristics of NPs can be manipulated to improve their 
tumor uptake without sacrificing the circulation time. This review focuses on 
design and applications of PEGylated NPs for tumor targeted drug delivery in 
animal models and clinical setting.

Experiences of home care assistants providing social care to older people: A 
context in transition.

Author information:

(2)Department of clinical Science and Education, Karolinska Institutet, 
Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden.

AIM: The aim was to describe home care assistants' (HCA) experiences of 
providing social care in older people's own homes.
BACKGROUND: With the increase in average life expectancy and related growth of 
the elder population, addressing geriatric care needs has become an increasingly 
vital issue. However, the frontline workforce faces major challenges in meeting 
these needs, including a lack of trained professionals entering the field.
DESIGN: A qualitative inductive design was used.
METHODS: A descriptive, qualitative study using focus group interviews and 
content analysis.
FINDINGS: The findings revealed that HCAs are active in an area facing 
challenges due to an older home-dwelling generation. Transfer of tasks should be 
reviewed considering changes to the workforce's skill mix brought on by task 
shifting.
CONCLUSIONS: Certain prerequisites are needed to enable unlicensed assistive 
personnel to perform a good job; they also need to receive affirmation that they 
are a crucial workforce carrying out multifaceted tasks. To improve and maintain 
the pull factors of social care work, it is crucial to clarify how older 
people's requirements influence the daily care relation.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings highlight HCAs' blurred responsibility 
when providing nursing and care to older people with multiple chronic conditions 
and functional disabilities. Increasing expectations are placed upon HCAs to 
cope with practical situations that are theoretically outside the bounds of 
social care. The findings contribute knowledge to further development of 
collaboration between social and health care providers as well as the important 
affirmation of this unlicensed personnel group in transition. A long-term plan 
is therefore needed to provide HCAs with the skills and tools they need to 
deliver care and support to older people with a variety of needs.

While the Fontan procedure has improved life expectancy, patients with single 
ventricle physiology have impaired exercise capacity due to limited increase in 
pulmonary blood flow during activity. Enhancing the "thoracic pump" using 
inspiratory muscle training (IMT) may ameliorate this impairment. Adult 
nonsmokers with Fontan physiology were recruited through Boston Children's 
Hospital's outpatient clinic. Participants underwent cardiopulmonary exercise 
testing and pulmonary function testing, followed by 12 weeks of IMT and then 
repeat testing. The primary endpoint was change in % predicted peak oxygen 
consumption (VO2). Secondary endpoints were changes in other exercise metrics. 
Eleven patients (6 male) were enrolled. Median ages at time of enrollment and 
Fontan completion were 28.8 years (25.7, 45.5) and 7.8 years (3.9, 16.5), 
respectively. Average baseline maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was normal; 
only 2 patients had MIP <70% predicted. Peak work rate improved significantly 
from baseline after 12 weeks of IMT (116.5 ± 45.0 to 126.8 ± 47.0 W, P = 0.019). 
Peak VO2 tended to improve (baseline 68.1 ± 14.3, change + 5.3 ± 9.6% predicted, 
P = 0.12), as did VE/VCO2 slope (34.1 ± 6.7 to 31.4 ± 3.6, P = 0.12). There was 
no change in peak tidal volume or MIP. In a small cohort of Fontan patients with 
mostly normal MIP, IMT was associated with significant improvement in peak work 
rate and a trend toward higher peak VO2 and improved ventilatory efficiency. 
Larger studies are needed to determine if this reflects true lack of effect or 
whether this pilot study was underpowered for effect size, and whether IMT is 
more narrowly useful for patients with impaired MIP.

CONTEXT: Many older adults discharged from an inpatient stay require postacute 
facility placement, which can be a barrier to hospice enrollment since the 
Medicare hospice benefit does not cover facility costs for patients under 
routine hospice care.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the extent to which need for postdischarge facility care 
was a barrier to hospice enrollment for older patients with short life 
expectancy discharged from a palliative care unit.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort using a prospectively collected database of 
patients 65 and older with a life expectancy of <6 months admitted to a 
palliative care unit in an urban, academic medical center and discharged alive 
from 2012 to 2017. Primary outcome was hospice enrollment at hospital discharge. 
Exposure of interest was need for facility placement at discharge.
RESULTS: Of 817 included patients, 649 (79%) were discharged with hospice. 
Patients discharged home had a significantly higher rate of hospice enrollment 
than patients discharged to a facility-92% versus 71% ( P < .0001). On 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, discharge to home versus facility 
remained a strong predictor of hospice enrollment, with an odds ratio for 
hospice enrollment of 6.04 (95% confidence interval: 3.73-9.79).
CONCLUSION: Need for postdischarge facility placement represents a barrier for 
hospice enrollment among older patients who are otherwise hospice appropriate. 
The structure of the hospice benefit may require modification so that these 
hospice appropriate patients can utilize the benefit.

BACKGROUND: Unhealthy alcohol consumption exacerbates the HIV epidemic in East 
Africa. Potential benefits of new trials that test the effectiveness of alcohol 
interventions could not be evaluated by traditional sampling methods. Given the 
competition for health care resources in East Africa, this study aims to 
determine the optimal sample size given the opportunity cost of potentially 
re-allocating trial funds towards cost-effective alcohol treatments.
METHODS: We used value of information methods to determine the optimal sample 
size by maximizing the expected net benefit of sampling for a hypothetical 2-arm 
intervention vs. control randomized trial, across ranges of policymaker's 
willingness-to-pay for the health benefit of an intervention. Probability 
distributions describing the relative likelihood of alternative trial results 
were imputed based on prior studies. In the base case, policymaker's 
willingness-to-pay was based on a simultaneously resource-constrained priority 
(routine HIV virological testing). Sensitivity analysis was performed for 
various willingness-to-pay thresholds and intervention durations.
RESULTS: A new effectiveness trial accounting for the benefit of more precise 
decision-making on alcohol intervention implementation would benefit East Africa 
$67,000 with the optimal sample size of 100 persons per arm under the base case 
willingness-to-pay threshold and intervention duration of 20 years. At both a 
conservative willingness-to-pay of 1 x GDP/capita and a high willingness-to-pay 
of 3 x GDP/capita for an additional health gain added by an alcohol 
intervention, a new trial was not recommended due to limited decision 
uncertainty. When intervention duration was 10 or 5 years, there was no return 
on investment across suggested willingness-to-pay thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Value of information methods could be used as an alternative 
approach to assist the efficient design of alcohol trials. If reducing unhealthy 
alcohol use is a long-term goal for HIV programs in East Africa, additional new 
trials with optimal sample sizes ranging from 100 to 250 persons per arm could 
save the opportunity cost of implementing less cost-effective alcohol strategies 
in HIV prevention. Otherwise, conducting a new trial is not recommended.

BACKGROUND: The Quality Adjusted Life Year influences the allocation of 
significant amounts of healthcare resources. Despite this surprisingly little 
research effort has been devoted to analysing how beliefs and attitudes to 
hastening death influence preferences for health states anchored at "dead" and 
"perfect health". In this paper we examine how, inter alia, adherence to 
particular religious beliefs (religiosity) influences attitudes to euthanasia 
and how, inter alia, attitudes to euthanasia influences the willingness to 
assign worse than dead (WTD) values to health states using data collected as 
part of the Irish EQ5D5L valuation study.
METHODS: A sample of 160 respondents each supplied 10 composite time trade-off 
valuations and information on religiosity and attitudes to euthanasia as part of 
a larger national survey. Data were analysed using a recursive bivariate probit 
model in which attitudes to euthanasia and willingness to assign WTD values were 
analysed jointly as functions of a range of covariates.
RESULTS: Religiosity was a significant determinant of attitudes to euthanasia 
and attitudes to euthanasia were a significant determinant of the likelihood of 
assigning WTD values. A significant negative correlation in errors between the 
two probit models was observed indicative of support for the hypothesis of 
endogeneity between attitudes to euthanasia and readiness to assign WTD values.
CONCLUSION: In Ireland attitudes and beliefs play an important role in 
understanding health state preferences. Beyond Ireland this may have 
implications for: the construction of representative samples; understanding the 
values accorded health states and; the frequency with which value sets must be 
updated.

OBJECTIVE: To simulate the cost-effectiveness of historical and modern treatment 
scenarios that achieve excellent vs. poor glycemic control in type 1 diabetes 
(T1DM).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe and compare the costs of intensive and 
conventional therapies for T1DM as performed during DCCT, and modern intensive 
and basic therapy scenarios using insulin analogs, pens, pumps, and continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM) to achieve excellent or poor glycemic control. We then 
assess the differences in treatment costs and the costs of outcomes over 
30 years and report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Over 30 years, DCCT intensive therapy cost $127,500 to $181,600 more 
per participant than DCCT conventional therapy, and modern intensive therapy 
cost $87,700 to $409,000 more per individual than modern basic therapy. 
Excellent glycemic control averted as much as $90,900 in costs from 
complications and added ~1.62 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per 
participant over 30 years. When costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually, 
DCCT intensive therapy and modern intensive therapies that use multiple daily 
injections (MDI) or pumps are cost-saving or cost-effective 
(<$100,000/QALY-gained). If applied to all patients with T1DM, modern intensive 
therapy using pumps and CGM is not cost-effective (>$250,000/QALY-gained) but 
would be more cost-effective if associated with less hypoglycemia, better 
glycemic control, fewer complications, or improved health-related 
quality-of-life.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the least expensive intensive therapy needed to safely 
achieve treatment goals for patients with T1DM represents a good value for 
money.

BACKGROUND: Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) 
presents a clinical conundrum. Rigorous long-term surveillance or surgical 
resection is recommended. The economic consequences of the management have not 
been fully investigated.
METHODS: A Markov decision model compared 4 strategies for low-risk BD-IPMN: 
I = upfront total pancreatectomy, II = upfront partial pancreatectomy, 
III = initial surveillance, IV = watchful waiting. Surveillance was based on the 
Swedish Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer. Probabilities and costs were obtained 
from the participating unit and from the scientific literature. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and sensitivity analyses were 
performed by varying relevant parameters. Survival was reported in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Strategy III was the most cost-effective strategy with an ICER of €31 
682 compared to strategy IV. Strategy I was the most expensive but yielded the 
best QALY (9.32). Total number of years, annual risk of pancreatic cancer and 
annual risk of a low-risk BD-IPMN turning into a high-risk lesion had the 
greatest impact in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial surveillance seems to be the most cost-effective strategy 
in the management of low-risk asymptomatic BD-IPMN. However, the possibility of 
personalized approaches remains to be investigated.

BACKGROUND: Analytic morphometry is a novel concept in perioperative risk 
assessment. Low core muscle mass assessed by morphometry is associated with 
frailty and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of 
postoperative complications and mortality in oncologic, transplant, and aneurysm 
surgery. We aimed to study associations between core muscle mass and 
complication rates, length of hospital stay, and survival after surgical lower 
limb revascularization.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 263 patients considered for 
surgical lower limb revascularization between January 2013 and December 2014 
underwent cross-sectional imaging. Total psoas area (TPA) was measured on 
computed tomography angiograms at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra by two 
independent observers blinded to clinical details. Clinical information was 
collected from patients' notes and the electronic medical record. Cox and 
logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the effect of clinical 
factors and psoas muscle area on survival, complication rates, and prolonged 
hospital stay after surgical lower limb revascularization.
RESULTS: Data from 263 patients were analyzed. The American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score (hazard ratio [HR], 3.05; confidence interval [CI], 
1.69-5.50; P < .001), emergency status (HR, 2.26; CI, 1.21-4.22; P = .011), 
lowest TPA quartile (HR, 1.89; CI, 1.07-3.35; P = .028), and Fontaine stage (HR, 
1.63; CI, 1.04-2.53; P = .031) were found to be independent predictors of 
survival. Low TPA was not associated with increased rate of postoperative 
complications or prolonged hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Psoas muscle area may help identify patients with a shorter life 
expectancy after lower limb revascularization, but its role in predicting 
postoperative complications or length of hospital admission seems to be limited.

The pan-tropical sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla is an ecologically and 
economically important shallow water algal grazer. The aquaculture of T. 
gratilla has spurred growing interest in the population biology of the species, 
and by extension the generation of more molecular resources. To this purpose, de 
novo transcriptomes of T. gratilla were generated for two adults, a male and a 
female, as well as for a cohort of approximately 1000 plutei larvae. Gene 
expression profiles of three adult tissue samples were quantified and compared. 
These samples were of gonadal tissue, the neural ring, and pooled tube feet and 
pedicellariae. Levels of shared and different gene expression between sexes, as 
well as across functional categories of interest, including the immune system, 
toxins, genes involved in fertilization, and sensory genes are highlighted. 
Differences in expression of isoforms between the sexes and Sex determining 
Region Y-related High Mobility Group box groups is observed. Additionally an 
expansion of the tumor suppressor DMBT1 is observed in T. gratilla when compared 
to the annotated genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The 
draft transcriptome of T. gratilla is presented here in order to facilitate more 
genomic level analysis of emerging model sea urchin systems.

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been related to the extension shelf-life and 
maintenance of postharvest quality in fruits. However, the comparison of UV-B 
and UV-C treatment on the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds of grape remain 
unclear. This study provides a comparison on the mechanism of phenolic secondary 
metabolism at the same dose of 3.6 kJ m-2 UV treatment. Total phenolic 
compounds, total flavonoid, total flavanol, and total anthocyanin content and 
antioxidant activities of grapes after UV-C treatments were higher than those of 
the control and UV-B treatment. Among the evaluated parameters of individual 
phenolic compounds, the content of trans-resveratrol showed the highest 
percentage increase after the UV application. The transcriptions of PAL, CHS, 
F3H, LAR, ANS and STS were higher in grapes treated by UV-C than in those 
treated by UV-B. The CHS, LAR, ANS and STS genes were more induced in UV-B 
treatment than in control group. The same applied dose of UV-B or UV-C 
irradiation have different impact on gene expression and phenolic metabolites 
synthesis. The UV-C irradiation stimulated a higher gene expression of the 
phenolic compounds biosynthesis and also induced a greater accumulation of these 
metabolites at the same applied dose.

Chitosan (1.0% and 2.0%) and putrescine (1.0 and 2.0 mmol/L) treatments were 
used to investigate the effects of these compounds on the postharvest quality 
and shelf-life of two banana cultivars, "Native" and "Cavendish." Fruits were 
stored at 15 ± 2°C and a relative humidity of 85%-90% during a 20-day period. In 
the controls, increases in weight loss, microbial population, total soluble 
solids, and ethylene production and decreases in firmness, ascorbic acid 
contents, and fruit lightness occurred gradually during storage. All these 
changes were delayed significantly after treatments with chitosan and 
putrescine. Application of putrescine and chitosan also caused small increases 
in phenolic compound contents and antioxidant activity at the end of the storage 
period. Results obtained suggest that a treatment with 1% chitosan is effective 
in improving the postharvest quality and shelf-life of banana, and open the 
possibility that lower concentrations of chitosan may be also effective.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of surveillance schedules for 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) amongst older adults.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis (MISCAN) 
microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of various surveillance 
schedules (every 3 months to every 24 months, for 2, 5 or 10 years or lifetime) 
for older adults (aged 65-85 years) with NMIBC. For each surveillance schedule 
we calculated total costs per patient and the number of quality adjusted
