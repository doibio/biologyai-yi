Human-induced salinization of freshwaters constitutes a growing global problem, 
whose consequences on streams functioning are largely unknown. Climate change 
projections predict enhanced evaporation, as well as an increase in extreme 
events and in variability of precipitation. This will result in more frequent, 
extended and severe drought periods that may aggravate water salinization of 
streams and rivers. In this study we conducted a microcosm experiment to assess 
the combined effects of three drought regimes - abrupt (AD), slow (SD) and very 
slow transition to dryness (VSD) - and three levels of salinization (0, 4, 
6 g L-1 NaCl) on microbial-mediated oak leaf decomposition over ten weeks. 
Salinization did not affect mass loss and associated microbial respiration of 
colonized oak leaves but significantly reduced the biomass and eliminated the 
sporulating capacity of fungi. Desiccation negatively affected leaf 
decomposition regardless of regime. Even though microbial respiration did not 
react to the different treatments, lower fungal biomass, diversity, and conidial 
production were observed under AD; for fungal biomass these effects were 
amplified at higher salt concentrations (particularly at 6 g L-1). Our results 
indicate that effects of leaf litter desiccation depend on the rate of 
transition between wet and dry conditions and on the level of salt in the water. 
The two factors jointly affect decomposer survival and activity and, by 
extension, the dynamics of detrital food webs in streams.

The premature birth rate in Korea has increased from 13.5% in 2008 to 15.7% in 
2013. The complications of premature birth are a major determinant of neonatal 
mortality and morbidities. The purpose of this study was to estimate the burden 
of premature birth in Korea using disability-adjusted life years (DALY). DALY 
consists of years of life lost (YLL) and years lost due to disability (YLD). In 
this study, preterm birth complications refer to nine diseases: P07, P22, P25, 
P26, P27, P28, P52, P77, P612, and H351 (International Classification of 
Diseases-10th Revision). YLL was calculated using mortality data from the 2012 
National Health Insurance Data. YLD is a function of the prevalence, disability 
weight (DW), and duration of each complication. DW was determined by the Korean 
Disability Weight Study for National Burden of Disease in Korea 2013/2015. The 
burden of premature birth in Korea is 79,574 DALY (YLL: 43,725; YLD: 35,849). 
The burden for men (DALY: 43,603; YLL: 24,004; YLD: 19,599) is higher than that 
of women (DALY: 35,970; YLL: 19,720; YLD: 16,250). This study could provide 
essential data for evaluating the effects of policies intended to reduce preterm 
birth.

Background To support decision-making in aortic valve replacement in nonelderly 
adults, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of reported outcome after 
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and to translate this to age-specific 
patient outcome estimates. Methods and Results A systematic review was conducted 
for papers reporting clinical outcome after aortic valve replacement with 
currently available bioprostheses in patients with a mean age <55 years, 
published between January 1, 2000, and January 9, 2016. Pooled reported event 
rates and time-to-event data were pooled and entered into a microsimulation 
model to calculate life expectancy and lifetime event risk for the ages of 25, 
35, 45, and 55 years at surgery. Nineteen publications were included, 
encompassing a total of 2686 patients with 21 117 patient-years of follow-up 
(pooled mean follow-up: 7.9±4.2 years). Pooled mean age at surgery was 50.7±11.0 
years. Pooled early mortality risk was 3.30% (95% CI, 2.39-4.55), late mortality 
rate was 2.39%/y (95% CI, 1.13-2.94), reintervention 1.82%/y (95% CI, 
1.31-2.52), structural valve deterioration 1.59%/y (95% CI, 1.21-2.10), 
thromboembolism 0.53%/y (95% CI, 0.42-0.67), bleeding 0.22%/y (95% CI, 
0.16-0.32), endocarditis 0.48%/y (95% CI, 0.37-0.62), and 20-year pooled 
actuarial survival was 58.7% and freedom from reintervention was 29.0%. Median 
time to structural valve deterioration was 17.3 years and median time to 
all-cause first reintervention was 16.9 years. For a 45-year-old adult, for 
example, this translated to a microsimulation-based estimated life expectancy of 
21 years (general population: 32 years) and lifetime risk of reintervention of 
78%, structural valve deterioration 71%, thromboembolism 12%, bleeding 5%, and 
endocarditis 9%. Conclusions Aortic valve replacement with bioprostheses in 
young adults is associated with high structural valve deterioration and 
reintervention rates and low, though not absent, hazards of thromboembolism and 
bleeding. Foremostly, most patients will require one or more reinterventions 
during their lifetime and survival is impaired in comparison with the age- and 
sex-matched general population. Prosthesis durability remains the main concern 
in nonelderly patients.

Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality 
worldwide; evidence-based strategies to decrease preterm birth are desperately 
needed.Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate which of three 
strategies for screening for shortened cervix in asymptomatic low-risk women is 
the most cost-effective in terms of prevention of preterm birth and associated 
morbidity.Study design: A decision analysis model was developed from available 
published evidence comparing three strategies in screening asymptomatic low-risk 
women for shortened cervix: (1) cervicometer with subsequent referral for 
transvaginal ultrasound, (2) transvaginal ultrasound screening, and (3) no 
screening. The cost and effectiveness of each strategy was assessed in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost in US dollars.Results: Screening 
with a cervicometer with referral was the most cost-effective strategy and 
represented a savings of $999.65 ($11,617.28 versus $12,616.93) over screening 
with ultrasound, and a savings of $15,601.62 ($11,617.28 versus $27,218.90) over 
no screening. Costs for outcomes ranged from $3528 for a healthy neonate 
≥34 weeks to $717,467.5 for a neonate <34 weeks with severe morbidity. The 
cervicometer strategy avoided 11.68 neonatal deaths per 1000 deliveries (3.59 
deaths versus 15.27 deaths) compared with no screening, and avoided 0.73 
neonatal deaths per 1000 deliveries (3.59 deaths versus 4.32 deaths) compared 
with ultrasound strategy. The cervicometer strategy prevented 82.44 preterm 
births per 1000 deliveries (22.56 versus 105.00) compared with no screening, and 
5.10 preterm births per 1000 deliveries (22.56 versus 27.66) compared with 
ultrasound strategy. Per QALY, cervicometer screening cost $386.57, transvaginal 
ultrasound cost $420.31, and no screening cost $922.73. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of these findings, including evaluation across the 
range of quoted transvaginal ultrasound costs ($43-$300).Conclusion: A 
simulation of universal screening of asymptomatic low-risk women with a 
cervicometer with subsequent referral for ultrasound for those with a cervix 
<25 mm is cost-effective and yields the greatest reduction in preterm births at 
<34 weeks. A risk simulation trial noted that a cervicometer strategy may be 
more expensive than a universal transvaginal ultrasound strategy, but both are 
less expensive than a no screening strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Knowledge gaps exist in the life expectancy and functional outcome 
of patients with congenitally corrected transposition (ccTGA) presenting early 
in life, which is relevant in the evaluation of early anatomic repair.
METHODS: In a single-center analysis, 91 patients with ccTGA were identified 
over 25 years, of which 31 presented with biventricular anatomy in the first 
year of life and formed the study cohort. End points for analysis included 
survival, moderate or worse tricuspid valve regurgitation, and systemic right 
ventricle (RV) dysfunction. Median follow-up was 4.9 years (range: 7 days to 20 
years).
RESULTS: Among 31 patients presenting in the first year of life, 9 (29%) never 
received cardiac surgery, while 22 (71%) underwent 36 cardiac operations. 
Overall freedom from moderate or severe systemic RV dysfunction was 75% at 10 
years. Overall survival was 82% at 10 years. Surgical mortality was 5.6% (2/36). 
Among survivors with a systemic RV, 23 (100%) of 23 were Ross or NYHA class I or 
II at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Congenitally corrected transposition presenting in the first year 
of life and maintaining a systemic RV can expect (1) long-term survival of more 
than 80% at 10 years, (2) low expected surgical mortality (overall 6%), and (3) 
75% late freedom from major RV dysfunction at 10 years. Pending 
multi-institutional analyses, this experience with a systemic RV in ccTGA 
provides an initial benchmark for comparison when considering early elective 
anatomic correction.

BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have a reduced life 
expectancy and a significant symptom burden. Our aim is to determine if 
inpatient palliative care (PC) referral for patients with ESLD is associated 
with decreased hospital readmission rates.
METHODS: The 2013 US Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) was used for the 
current analysis. The NRD allows for longitudinal analysis of all patient 
hospital admissions across 22 states. Patients ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis 
of ESLD with at least two decompensating events were included in the analysis. 
PC referral at the index hospitalisation divided the cohort into two groups, 
which were tracked for 9 months.
RESULTS: A total of 14 325 172 hospital admissions from the 2013 NRD were 
examined. In the first 3 months of 2013, a total of 3647 patients with ESLD were 
admitted with 206 (5.6%) receiving PC referral during the index admission. After 
the index hospitalisation, patients referred to PC were more likely to be 
discharged to skilled nursing facilities (45.5% vs 14.7%; p<0.01) or 
hospice/home care (32.9% vs 15.3%; p<0.01). After propensity score matching, 
those patients referred to PC demonstrated a significantly lower rate of 1-year 
hospital readmission (11.0% vs 32.1%; p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Inpatient PC referral for patients with ESLD was associated with 
lower rates of hospital readmission. Early concurrent PC referral likely has 
added beneficial effects beyond quality of life issues and symptom management.

Loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength has recently become a hot research 
topic with the extension of life span and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle in 
modern society. Maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is considered an essential 
determinant of muscle strength and function. Myokines are cytokines synthesized 
and released by myocytes during muscular contractions. They are implicated in 
autocrine regulation of metabolism in the muscle as well as in the 
paracrine/endocrine regulation of other tissues and organs including adipose 
tissue, the liver, and the brain through their receptors. Till date, secretome 
analysis of human myocyte culture medium has revealed over 600 myokines. In this 
review article, we summarize our current knowledge of major identified and 
characterized myokines focusing on their biological activity and function, 
particularly in muscle mass and function.

BACKGROUND: Endostatin (ES) is a promising anti-angiogenesis protein and has 
been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, but short 
half-life, poor stability and nonspecific delivery caused great pain to patients 
and produced unsatisfactory treatment effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: In this work, in order to overcome these disadvantages, ES was 
covalently modified by polysulfated heparin (PSH) with the expectancy of longer 
half-life, higher anti-angiogenesis activity and better cellular uptake.
METHODS: To characterize the cellular uptake, flow cytometry and confocal laser 
scanning microscopy were used to study the intracellular localization of 
fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ES and PSH-ES in EAhy926 endothelial cells. 
Zebrafish model was used to study the anti-angiogenesis activities of ES and its 
derivatives in vivo. The 125I-radiolabeled ES and PSH-ES were administered to 
healthy BALC/c mice for the pharmacokinetics study.
RESULTS: Compared with ES, better cellular uptake effects were detected in 
PSH-ES group. Both ES and PSH-ES showed inhibition on the intersegmental vessels 
formation, while PSH-ES displayed a higher one. The half-life of PSH-ES was 
lengthened and area under the curve (AUC) was increased. At the same time, ES 
and PSH-ES were both widely and rapidly distributed in the lungs, livers, 
kidneys and hearts with little difference.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that PSH displayed good properties as a novel 
glyco-modifier for protein and peptide. The results also showed that PSH-ES 
displayed better cellular uptake, higher antiangiogenesis activity and prolonged 
half-life, which would lead to better anti-tumour effects.

Organic pig husbandry systems in Europe are diverse - ranging from indoor 
systems with concrete outside run (IN) to outdoor systems all year round (OUT) 
and combinations of both on one farm (POUT). As this diversity has rarely been 
taken into account in research projects on organic pig production, the aim of 
this study was to assess and compare pig health, welfare and productivity in 
these three systems. Animal health and welfare were assessed using direct 
observation and records of 22 animal-based measures, comprising 17 health-, 3 
productivity- and 2 behavioural measures. These were collected in pregnant sows, 
weaners and fattening pigs during direct observations and from records within a 
cross-sectional study on 74 farms (IN: n = 34, POUT: n = 28, OUT: n = 12) in 
eight countries. Overall, prevalence of several animal health and welfare issues 
was low (e.g. median 0% for pigs needing hospitalisation, shoulder lesions, 
ectoparasites; <5% for runts, tail lesions, conjunctivitis). Exceptions in 
particular systems were respiratory problems in weaners and fatteners (IN: 
60.0%, 66.7%; POUT: 66.7%, 60.0%), weaning diarrhoea (IN: 25.0%), and short 
tails in fatteners (IN: 6.5%, POUT: 2.3%). Total suckling piglet losses 
(recorded over a period of 12 months per farm) were high in all three systems 
(IN: 21.3%; POUT: 21.6; OUT: 19.2%). OUT had lower prevalences of respiratory 
problems, diarrhoea and lameness of sows. POUT farms in most cases kept sows 
outdoors and weaners and fatteners similar to IN farms, which was reflected in 
the results regarding several health and welfare parameters. It can be 
concluded, that European organic pigs kept in all three types of husbandry 
system showed a low prevalence of health and welfare problems as assessed by our 
methodology, but respiratory health and diarrhoea should be improved in weaners 
and fatteners kept indoors and total piglet mortality in all systems. The 
results provide benchmarks for organic pig producers and organisations which can 
be used in strategies to promote health and welfare improvement. Furthermore, in 
future research, the identified health and welfare issues (e.g. suckling piglet 
mortality, weaning diarrhoea) should be addressed, specifically considering 
effects of husbandry systems.

Spondyloarthritis may be increasingly present in older patients as life 
expectancy increases. We investigated clinical differences between early-onset 
and late-onset spondyloarthritis in Japan.We retrospectively reviewed 114 
patients consecutively diagnosed with spondyloarthritis. The clinical course of 
each patient was observed for ≥1 year. We defined early-onset and late-onset 
spondyloarthritis as <57 or ≥57 years at a median age of this study group, 
respectively. We compared clinical characteristics between these 2 
groups.Disease duration was significantly shorter before diagnosis in the 
late-onset group (P < .01). Inflammatory back pain (IBP) was significantly more 
common in the early-onset group (P < .01), whereas dactylitis frequency was 
significantly higher in the late-onset group. Significantly more patients with 
early-onset spondyloarthritis were human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27-positive 
(P < .01). Articular synovitis, particularly of the wrist, was significantly 
more common on power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) in the late-onset group 
(P < .01). Tenosynovitis or peritendinitis, particularly in the finger and wrist 
flexors were also more frequent in the late-onset group (P < .001 and P < .05, 
respectively). Enthesitis of the finger collateral ligament and lateral 
collateral ligament were significantly more common in the late-onset group (both 
P < .05). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that, comparatively, 
IBP was significantly and independently much more likely to occur in the 
early-onset group.The patients with late-onset spondyloarthritis had a lower 
frequency of IBP and HLA B27 and a higher frequency of dactylitis and PDUS 
findings in peripheral involvement.

OBJECTIVES: To validate a method that estimates disease burden as 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from insurance claims and death records 
for the purpose of identifying the conditions that place the greatest burden of 
disease on an insured population.
STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of the DALYs generated from death records and insurance 
claims with functional status and health status reported by individuals who were 
insured with one of HealthPartners' commercial products and completed a health 
assessment in 2011, 2012, or 2013.
METHODS: We calculated values of Spearman's ρ, the rank-order coefficient of 
correlation, for the correlation of DALYs with self-reported function and 
self-reported health. We did the same for the number of medical conditions per 
member and the cost of claims per member.
RESULTS: The Spearman's ρ values for the correlation of DALYs with function were 
-0.241, -0.238, and -0.229 in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively (all P <.0001). 
The respective Spearman's ρ values for the correlation of DALYs with health were 
-0.197, -0.189, and -0.192 (all P <.0001). These Spearman's ρ values were 
similar in magnitude to those for the correlation of the number of medical 
conditions per member with function (-0.212, -0.213, and -0.205) and health 
(-0.199, -0.196, and -0.198) over the 3 years. The Spearman's ρ values for the 
correlation of DALYs with function and health were greater than or equal to 
those for the correlation of cost of claims per member with function (-0.144, 
-0.193, and -0.186) and greater than those for the cost of claims per member 
with health (-0.126, -0.150, and -0.151).
CONCLUSIONS: Health plans can use DALYs calculated from their own health 
insurance claims and death records as a valid and inexpensive method to identify 
the conditions that place the greatest burden of poor function and ill health on 
their insured populations.

Open and Endovascular Management of Aortic Aneurysms.

Boston, MA.

Aneurysmal disease can affect any segment of the aorta, from the aortic root to 
the aortic bifurcation. The treatment of aortic aneurysms has evolved 
dramatically in the past 3 decades, with the introduction of endovascular 
aneurysm repair using stent grafts causing a major paradigm shift in the field 
of aortic aneurysm surgery. While the technical details of the management of 
aortic aneurysms vary greatly depending on the location of an aneurysm, the 
principles remain the same. Successful aortic aneurysm treatment depends on 
either open replacement or endovascular exclusion of the aneurysmal segment with 
healthy artery proximal and distal to the repair. Major aortic branches of the 
arch and visceral segment add additional technical complexity to aneurysms 
involving these regions. Even as endovascular repair becomes the primary 
treatment modality for most aortic aneurysms, open repair remains an essential 
treatment modality in many circumstances. Additionally, long-term results of 
endovascular repair suggest that younger patients with long life expectancy and 
low-perioperative risk may benefit more from open repair. Therefore, technical 
expertise in both endovascular and open treatment is necessary for a 
comprehensive aortic aneurysm surgery practice.

In line with well-known subjective measures of health, such as self-rated health 
and subjective life expectancy, an individual's belief about future security 
provided by the government could also be an important factor affecting his life 
expectancy. The aim of this study was to use the response of the elderly Korean 
population in regards to the National Aging Security System (NASS), and assess 
its association with the risk of mortality even with SRH included in the 
analysis. Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA) from 2006 to 
2016 were assessed using longitudinal data analysis and 10,254 research subjects 
were included at baseline in 2006. To analyze the association between belief 
about future possibility of NASS and all-cause mortality, Cox proportional 
hazards model was used. In terms of the future possibility of NASS, people who 
thought more negatively displayed greater risk of mortality at the end of the 
follow-up. With the Positive group as reference: Moderate group showed a 18% 
increase (HR = 1.178, 95% CI: 1.022, 1.357), and Negative groups showed a 19% 
increase (HR = 1.192, 95% CI: 1.043, 1.362). The results of our study showed 
that people's belief regarding future security could be associated with 
mortality rates. Our finding is important, because it provides additional 
support to the importance of considering subjective measures of health in 
epidemiological research. Furthermore, the findings of our research could be 
useful in terms of future policy making.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Myocardial infarction (MI) in young adults accounts 
for up to 10% of all cases. Regarding life expectancy and professional activity, 
it is extremely important to restore and maintain young patients' full 
performance. Therefore, secondary prevention is especially vital in this group 
of patients. The paper focuses on the analysis of pharmacotherapy in young MI 
patients in Poland, assessing disparities between the European Society of 
Cardiology guidelines and clinical practice, and regional differences among the 
provinces.
METHODS: The analysis was conducted using the data from a nationwide, 
observational, multicentre, prospective study-the Polish Registry of Acute 
Coronary Syndromes (PL-ACS). The data were collected from patients ≤45 years old 
with MI who were hospitalized in the period 2010-2014.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A retrospective study included 6367 MI patients. They 
constituted 3.9% of all the patients with MI in Poland. Despite the fact that 
during hospitalization regional differences were observed in case of 
acetylsalicylic acid (range 70.3%-93.8%), β-blockers (range 50.0%-79.6%), 
statins (range 53.4%-85.7%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (range 
46.9%-75.0%), the majority of patients received the drugs according to the 
guidelines. Regional differences found at discharge also regarded those 
medications, but the range of observed variations was smaller. On average, 
three-quarter of patients received guideline-recommended medications. Still, in 
some provinces, almost a quarter of patients were administered those medications 
only at discharge.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In the study population, there were significant 
differences between the provinces regarding pharmacotherapy during 
hospitalization, which concerned major groups of medications. However, 
pharmacotherapy indicated at discharge revealed fewer regional differences and 
adhered to guideline recommendations to a greater extent. Nevertheless, there is 
still some room for improvement, especially with regard to pharmacotherapy 
during hospitalization.

Brominated flame retardants are known to disrupt thyroid hormone (TH) 
homeostasis in several vertebrate species, but the molecular mechanisms 
underlying this process and their effects on TH-sensitive tissues during the 
stages of early development are not well characterised. In this study, we 
exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo-larvae to 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl 
ether (BDE-47) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) via the water for 96 h from 
fertilisation and assessed for lethality, effects on development and on the 
expression of a suite of genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis 
via both real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) on whole body extracts and whole 
mount in situ hybridisation (WISH) to identify tissue targets. The 96-h lethal 
median concentration (96h-LC50) for TBBPA was 0.9 μM and mortality was preceded 
by retardation of development (smaller animals) and morphological deformities 
including, oedemas in the pericardial region and tail, small heads, swollen yolk 
sac extension. Exposure to BDE-47 did not affect zebrafish embryo-larvae 
survival at any of the concentrations tested (1-100 μM) but caused yolk sac and 
craniofacial deformities, a curved spine and shorter tail at the highest 
exposure concentration. TBBPA exposure resulted in higher levels of mRNAs for 
genes encoding deiodinases (dio1), transport proteins (ttr), the thyroid 
follicle synthesis protein paired box 8 (pax8) and glucuronidation enzymes 
(ugt1ab) and lower levels of dio3b mRNAs in whole body extracts, with responses 
varying with developmental stage. BDE-47 exposure resulted in higher levels of 
thrb, dio1, dio2, pax8 and ugt1ab mRNAs and lower levels of ttr mRNAs in whole 
body extracts. TBBPA and BDE-47 therefore appear to disrupt the TH system at 
multiple levels, increasing TH conjugation and clearance, disrupting thyroid 
follicle development and altering TH transport. Compensatory responses in TH 
production/ metabolism by deiodinases were also evident. WISH analyses further 
revealed that both TBBPA and BDE-47 caused tissue-specific changes in thyroid 
receptor and deiodinase enzyme expression, with the brain, liver, pronephric 
ducts and craniofacial tissues appearing particularly responsive to altered TH 
signalling. Given the important role of TRs in mediating the actions of THs 
during key developmental processes and deiodinases in the control of peripheral 
TH levels, these transcriptional alterations may have implications for TH 
sensitive target genes involved in brain and skeletal development. These 
findings further highlight the potential vulnerability of the thyroid system to 
disruption by BFRs during early developmental windows.

Worldwide, antibiotic usage exceeds 100,000 tons per year and there is 
increasing concern over the fate of these substances. Antibiotics are ubiquitous 
in the environment and significant concentrations have been detected in fresh 
waters. In this review, we highlight important aspects of antibiotic pollution 
in fresh waters: that concentrations of antibiotics in the environment are 
substantial, that micro-organisms are susceptible to this, that bacteria can 
evolve resistance in the environment, and that antibiotic pollution affects 
natural food webs while interacting with other stressors; which taken together 
poses a number of challenges for environmental scientists. In the literature, we 
found examples of considerable antibiotic pollution in fresh waters. In the 
Americas, antibiotic concentrations of up to 15 μg/L have been measured; with 
higher concentrations reported from European and African studies (over 10 μg/L 
and 50 μg/L respectively), and in Asian-pacific countries concentrations over 
450 μg/L have been detected. While these concentrations might not be deemed 
harmful to humans, non-target freshwater organisms could be affected by them. 
Bioassays show that some of the antibiotics found in surface waters affect 
microbes at concentrations below 10 μg/L. Among the most potent antibiotics are 
those that prevail in streams and rivers in these concentrations, such as 
ciprofloxacin. Sub-lethal concentrations might not kill prokaryotes but 
contribute to increased bacterial resistance and change the composition of 
single-celled communities, as demonstrated in laboratory experiments. This has 
implications for the microbial food web (e.g. interactions among and between 
bacteria and their protozoan consumers) and by extension, larger organisms and 
ecosystem health. The fact that the effects of antibiotics are extremely 
context-dependent represents a challenge, particularly for in vitro research. We 
suggest future research avenues, taking into account food web experiments, 
antibiotics interacting with one another (and other stressors) and discuss how 
these can help to answer multi-layered research questions.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCI) are a neurological condition 
associated with reduced well-being, increased morbidity and reductions in life 
expectancy. Estimates of all-cause and cause-specific mortality can aid in 
identifying targets for prevention and management of contributors for premature 
mortality.
OBJECTIVES: To compare all-cause and cause-specific rates of mortality to that 
of the Swiss general population; to identify differentials in risk of 
cause-specific mortality according to lesion characteristics.
METHODS: All-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 
calculated using data from the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury cohort study. 
Cause-specific subhazard ratios were estimated within a competing risk framework 
using flexible parametric survival models.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2011, 2,492 persons sustained a TSCI, of which 379 
died. Persons with TSCI had a mortality rate more than 2 times higher than that 
of the Swiss general population (SMR 2.32; 95% CI 2.10-2.56). Tetraplegic 
lesions were associated with an increased risk of mortality due to respiratory 
and cardiovascular diseases, infections, and accidents. Cause-specific SMRs were 
notably elevated for SCI-related conditions such as urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) and septicemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SMRs due to cardiovascular disease, UTIs and 
septicemia-related mortality suggest the need for innovation when managing 
associated secondary health conditions.

The promotion of physical activity through better urban design is one pathway by 
which health and well-being improvements can be achieved. This study aimed to 
quantify health and health-related economic impacts associated with physical 
activity in an urban riverside park regeneration project in Barcelona, Spain. We 
used data from Barcelona local authorities and meta-analysis assessing physical 
activity and health outcomes to develop and apply the "Blue Active Tool". We 
estimated park user health impacts in terms of all-cause mortality, morbidity 
(ischemic heart disease; ischemic stroke; type 2 diabetes; cancers of the colon 
and breast; and dementia), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
health-related economic impacts. We estimated that 5753 adult users visited the 
riverside park daily and performed different types of physical activity (walking 
for leisure or to/from work, cycling, and running). Related to the physical 
activity conducted on the riverside park, we estimated an annual reduction of 
7.3 deaths (95% CI: 5.4; 10.2), and 6.2 cases of diseases (95% CI: 2.0; 11.6). 
This corresponds to 11.9 DALYs (95% CI: 3.4; 20.5) and an annual health-economic 
impact of 23.4 million euros (95% CI: 17.2 million; 32.8 million). The urban 
regeneration intervention of this riverside park provides health and 
health-related economic benefits to the population using the infrastructure.

Pulmonary disease is the main cause of the morbidity and mortality of patients 
affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). The lung pathology is dominated by excessive 
recruitment of neutrophils followed by an exaggerated inflammatory process that 
has also been reported to occur in the absence of apparent pathogenic 
infections. Airway surface dehydration and mucus accumulation are the driving 
forces of this process. The continuous release of reactive oxygen species and 
proteases by neutrophils contributes to tissue damage, which eventually leads to 
respiratory insufficiency. CF has been considered a paediatric problem for 
several decades. Nevertheless, during the last 40 years, therapeutic options for 
CF have been greatly improved, turning CF into a chronic disease and extending 
the life expectancy of patients. Unfortunately, chronic inflammatory processes, 
which are characterized by a substantial release of cytokines and chemokines, 
along with ROS and proteases, can accelerate cellular senescence, leading to 
further complications in adulthood. The alterations and mechanisms downstream of 
CFTR functional defects that can stimulate cellular senescence remain unclear. 
However, while there are correlative data suggesting that cellular senescence 
may be implicated in CF, a causal or consequential relationship between cellular 
senescence and CF is still far from being established. Senescence can be both 
beneficial and detrimental. Senescence may suppress bacterial infections and 
cooperate with tissue repair. Additionally, it may act as an effective
