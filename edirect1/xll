The authors report a series of patients with osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma 
irradiated 1968-1988 at the Institute of Radiology of "La Sapienza" University, 
Rome. Twelve of 17 osteosarcoma patients (71%) died and 5 are alive, with a 
median survival of 13 months. Seven of 12 Ewing's sarcoma patients (58%) died 
and 5 are alive (42%), with a median survival of 67 months. These results are 
similar to those of most contemporary series in the literature; the long 
follow-up of our series allowed us to calculate actuarial survival rates at 5, 
10 and 15 years of 41%, 34% and 17%, respectively, in osteosarcoma patients and 
75%, 45% and 34% for those with Ewing's sarcoma. The review of the literature on 
the management of bone tumors high-lights the importance of new developments and 
technologies to improve the life expectancy of these patients. The authors 
discuss the role of modern imaging techniques in defining tumor margins and 
predicting treatment-induced tumor regression and the research into new 
therapeutic approaches. Multimodality combinations and new schedules appear 
promising tools to improve prognosis and to reduce side-effects, thus stressing 
the need of combined efforts of surgeons, radiotherapists and chemotherapists. 
State-of-the-art radiotherapy can further increase local control with higher 
total doses to the lesion and selectively sparing adjacent normal tissues, 
thanks to 3D treatment planning of hadron beam equipment.

In Tunisia a growing extension of chronic diseases has resulted from the 
environmental and behavioral changes such as the adoption of new dietary habits, 
sedentarity habitat, stress of urbanization and work conditions. To illustrate 
this trend, we undertook a household epidemiologic survey of a representative 
sample of the adult urban population of Soussa (n = 957) to assess the main 
cardiovascular risk factors except the lipid profile distribution. This study 
showed a high prevalence of hypertension (> 160/95 mm Hg): 18.8% with an 
adjusted rate of 15.6%. History of diabetes 10.2%, obesity (BMI > 30) 27.7% 
significantly higher in women (34.4%), android obesity 36%, smoking habits 21.5% 
significantly higher in men (61.4%). With this risk factor profile, Tunisia has 
to implement a national strategy of primary prevention and heart health 
promotion in addition to the efforts recently made in secondary prevention of 
some chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive tumor with 
a median survival rate of 6 months.
AIM: To analyze presentation, treatment, morphology, immunohistochemistry, and 
nuclear DNA analysis of a cohort of patients with ATC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with ATC (11 female) with a mean age of 65 
years were seen at our hospital from 1970-1995. The data were obtained from the 
clinical records and the morphology, immunohistochemic studies and DNA pattern 
were performed in slides obtained from archival specimens.
RESULTS: Previous or coexisting thyroide disease was documented in 10 patients 
(9 multinodular goiters and one Grave's). The most frequent presentation was a 
rapidly growing tumor associated with dysphagia, cervical pain, hoarseness and 
dyspnea. A cold thyroid nodule was detected by thyroid scan in 10 patients. The 
most frequent subtype was the spindle cell variety. Papillary thyroid carcinoma 
coexisted in eight cases, two of them corresponded to the tall cell variant. 
Reactivity for S-100 protein and vimentin was studied in six patients: all were 
positive for S-100 protein and vimentin, 5/6 for epithelial membrane antigen, 
half for carcinoembriogenic antigen, 2/6 for thyroglobulin and calcitonin, and 
one for neuronal specific enolase. These six tumors showed a diploid DNA 
pattern. Tumor resection was achieved in 2/11 and none survived six years after 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: ATC is a highly aggressive tumor coexisting with thyroid 
pathologies. Spindle cell variant is the most frequent with positive reactivity 
for S-100 protein, vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen. Most tumors have a 
diploid DNA content.

[Menopause and quality of life].

[Article in French]

Pasini W.

Menopause represents a relatively long period in a women's life going along with 
alterations derived from ovarial decline and with corresponding changes of 
psychosomatic, psychic and behavioural pattern. Like pregnancy it should not be 
considered as a disease but as an evolutive phase in a woman's life in 
biological as well as in psychologic respect. Hundred years ago European women 
entered menopause at an age of about 40 years and their life expectancy was 
about 6 years and after menopause. Today, onset of menopause reaches 55 years, 
life expectancy, however, has expanded to the 80s, even 83 in Switzerland. It is 
therefore important and justified to provide all medical and psychological 
measures that may ameliorate quality of life for all women expecting a prolonged 
life.

[Alzheimer disease: what is the status today?].

[Article in German]

Stähelin HB(1).

Author information:

In populations with high life expectancy, about 7% of persons aged 65 and over 
suffer from Alzheimer's Disease. Diagnosis is based on the demonstration of 
dementia, characteristic clinical, neuropsychological, and neuro-imaging 
findings allowing the exclusion of other etiologies. Alzheimer's Disease may be 
caused by a number of genetic etiologies. Mutation of the preseniline genes or 
the APP gene are rare and lead to early onset of the disease. Late onset of 
Alzheimer's Disease is mostly polygenetic or of multifactorial origin. Genetic 
and exogenous factors interact in the manifestation of the disease. Of 
importance is apolipoprotein E; carriers of the allele apo E4 run a markedly 
increased risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease. The biochemical hallmark of 
Alzheimer's Disease is the marked reduction of the cholinergic innervation of 
the CNS; thus, cholinergic substitution allows today for the first time a 
therapy of the disease based on pathophysiological findings. The specificity of 
therapy and the necessity of an early intervention require a two-step diagnostic 
procedure; i) By appropriate screening procedures, the primary care physician 
detects already mild dementias. ii) Persons with dementia are referred to 
specialists (neurology, psychogeriatrics, geriatrics or memory clinic) for 
differential diagnostic work-up. The diagnosis of "probable Alzheimer's Disease" 
is the indication for specific pharmacotherapy. The holistic therapeutic 
approach to patients with Alzheimer's Disease includes not only a drug 
treatment, but also psychotherapy (milieu therapy) and counselling of the 
caregivers. The interdisciplinary collaboration between primary care physicians, 
specialists and institutions for care of patients with dementia is a 
prerequisite for optimal therapeutic success. The aim is the preservation of 
quality of life, and to maintain patients as long as possible in their personal 
environment.

PURPOSE: To compare the clinical patterns and survival of young and adult (AP) 
versus paediatric (PP) patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of 117 patients (82% AP, 18% PP) seen 
in four cities of the Mexican Republic were analysed, the clinical course and 
survival of both groups being compared.
RESULTS: No sex difference was found in the two patient-groups: 51% and 52% 
males, 49% and 48% females in AP and PP, respectively. The onset of PNH had 
similar distribution for the two groups of patients: aplastic form, 45% in AP 
and 62% in PP; cytopenias, 24% in AP versus 27% in PP; haemolysis, 28% in AP and 
9% in PP, and thrombosis, 3% in AP versus 0% in PP. The clinical features with 
significant difference were: anaemic+haemorrhagic syndrome (39 AP (40%) vs 14 PP 
(67%), p = 0.02), initial diagnosis of immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura (7 
AP (7%) vs 7 PP (33%), p = 0.003), and death rate (17 AP (18%) vs 8 PP (38%), p 
= 0.04). The actuarial survival curves showed significant differences between 
both groups (p = 0.045, Cox-Mantel), with estimated 10-year survival of 81% for 
AP and 55% for PP, and 15-year survivals of 64% for AP and 55% for PP.
CONCLUSIONS: Seemingly, PNH in paediatric age has poorer prognosis than in 
adults, which is associated to higher incidence of fatal haemorrhages due to 
thrombocytopenia.

Kidney donors live longer.

Sweden.

BACKGROUND: A very important issue in living kidney donor transplantation is 
whether the donation is safe for the donor. The aim of this study was to examine 
survival and causes of death in kidney donors and to assess the renal function 
in those who had donated a kidney more than 20 years ago.
METHODS: A total of 459 living donor nephrectomies were performed in Stockholm 
from 1964 until the end of 1994. By using national registers, all 430 donors 
living in Sweden were traced. Donor survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Expected survival was computed using the Hakulinens method and was based 
on national mortality rates.
RESULTS: Forty-one subjects had died between 15 months and 31 years after the 
donation. The mortality pattern was similar to that in the general population, 
the majority dying of cardiovascular diseases and malignancies. After 20 years 
of follow-up, 85% of the donors were alive, whereas the expected survival rate 
was 66%. Survival was thus 29% better in the donor group. One third of the 
donors (aged 46-91 years) who had donated >20 years ago had hypertension. There 
was a deterioration in the renal function with increasing age, similar to what 
is seen among normal healthy subjects. The average glomerular filtration rate in 
donors aged 75 years and over was 48 ml/min/1.73 m2.
CONCLUSIONS: To donate a kidney does not seem to constitute any long-term risk. 
The better survival among donors is probably due to the fact that only healthy 
persons are accepted for living kidney donation.

[Impact of smoking on mortality of the Swiss population and 1988/1993 life 
expectancy].

[Article in French]

Berne.

The elaboration of new mortality tables by the Swiss statistical office has 
allowed to estimate the impact of different pathology or risk factors on the 
average life duration of the resident population in Switzerland. Thus, 
attributable death of the smoking habits have for effect to decrease the life 
expectancy of swiss citizens of 2.9 years for men and 0.7 years for women, for 
the period 1988/1993. The calculation of mortality rates attributable to this 
factor of risk shows nevertheless that the risk of death has decreased since the 
end of years 1960 for all quinquennial age groups between 35 and 74 years. The 
smoking habits would be responsible of approximately 16% of deaths observed in 
the swiss population and 20% of premature deaths (between 25 and 64 years). The 
present analysis shows furthermore that different evolutions of the mortality 
associated with the smoking habits characterize men and women.

Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of a single course of interferon-alpha 2b in 
patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C.

    Ann Intern Med. 1997 Nov 15;127(10):918-20.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of illness and death in the 
United States. Interferon-alpha 2b can induce clinical, biochemical, and 
virologic remission in some patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of this treatment, particularly in patients with 
histologically mild disease, is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha 2b in mild 
chronic hepatitis C.
DESIGN: Meta-analysis of five prospective trials and cost-effectiveness 
analysis. Projection of the clinical and economic outcomes expected from loss of 
hepatitis C virus was done by using a Markov simulation. The potential effect of 
uncertainty in the model assumptions was tested by using sensitivity analyses.
DATA SOURCES: Search of the MEDLINE database, opinions of expert panels, 
hospital cost data, and adjusted physician charges.
PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C.
INTERVENTION: The model assumed a single 6-month course of recombinant 
interferon-alpha 2b.
MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and 
marginal cost-effectiveness ratios from a managed care perspective.
RESULTS: In 27% of patients with mild chronic hepatitis C treated with 
interferon-alpha 2b for 6 months, serum alanine aminotransferase levels 
permanently returned to normal and viral status remained negative. The model 
estimated that interferon-alpha 2b treatment in this population should increase 
life expectancy by 3.1 years if given at 20 years of age, by 1.5 years at 35 
years of age, and by 22 days at 70 years of age; discounted marginal 
cost-effectiveness ratios are $500, $1900, and $62,000 per year of life gained, 
respectively. Varying the long-term response rates and progression rates for 
mild and moderate chronic hepatitis to near zero in sensitivity analyses 
substantially affected the results: Ratios ranged from $31,000 for a 20-year-old 
patient to $640,000 for a 70-year-old patient.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of estimations in this mathematical model of the 
natural history of chronic hepatitis C, treating mild chronic hepatitis with 
interferon-alpha 2b should prolong life expectancy at a reasonable marginal cost 
per year of life gained, particularly in younger patients.

Cost-effectiveness of 6 and 12 months of interferon-alpha therapy for chronic 
hepatitis C.

Jr.

Author information:

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 1997 Nov 15;127(10):918-20.

BACKGROUND: Interferon-alpha is effective in only a small number of patients 
with chronic hepatitis C, although prolonged treatment may increase the response 
rate. There is concern that the expense of interferon-alpha therapy may not be 
justified by the low response rates and uncertain long-term benefit.
OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and economic outcomes after 6 months and 12 
months of interferon-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C.
DESIGN: A Markov model depicting the natural progression of chronic hepatitis C. 
On the basis of this model, a simulated trial compared no therapy with 6 and 12 
months of interferon-alpha therapy at standard doses (3 million U three times 
weekly).
PATIENTS: Four age-specific cohorts (30, 40, 50, and 60 years of age) with 
chronic hepatitis C.
MEASUREMENTS: Number of deaths from liver disease, total costs, and cumulative 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Six and 12 months of interferon-alpha treatment gained 0.25 QALYs at an 
incremental cost of $1000 and 0.37 QALYs at an incremental cost of $1900, 
respectively. Thus, although 6 months of interferon-alpha therapy was less 
efficacious than 12 months of therapy, it was more cost-effective ($4000 per 
QALY gained compared with $5000 per QALY gained). Nonetheless, in patients 
younger than 60 years of age, both 6 and 12 months of therapy compared favorably 
with other established medical interventions, such as screening mammography and 
cholesterol reduction programs. Important variables affecting the 
cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha treatment included the cost and efficacy 
of interferon-alpha, the cost of treatment for decompensated cirrhosis, and 
quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
CONCLUSION: From the standpoint of cost-effectiveness, interferon-alpha therapy 
for 6 or 12 months may be justified in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The 
possible exception is patients older than 60 years of age.

BACKGROUND: Heterozygosity for a 32-nucleotide deletion in the C-C chemokine 
receptor 5 gene (CCR5 delta 32) is associated with delayed disease progression 
in persons infected with HIV-1.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the predictive value of CCR5 genotype with that of 
established markers in the clinical course of HIV-1 infection.
DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study and nested case-control study. The 
latter included only long-term survivors, who were individually matched with 
progressors.
SETTING: Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 364 homosexual men with HIV-1 infection.
MEASUREMENTS: Polymerase chain reaction was used for CCR5 genotyping. Univariate 
and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were done for disease 
progression with CCR5 genotype, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, T-lymphocyte function, 
HIV-1 biological phenotype (syncytium-inducing or non-syncytium-inducing HIV-1), 
and viral RNA load in serum as covariates.
RESULTS: In the case-control study, 48% of long-term survivors were heterozygous 
for CCR5 delta 32 compared with 9% of progressors (odds ratio, 6.9 [95% CI, 1.9 
to 24.8]). In the total study sample, CCR5 delta 32 heterozygotes had 
significantly delayed disease progression (P < 0.001; relative hazard, 0.4 [CI, 
0.3 to 0.6]), a 1.5-fold slower decrease in CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (P = 0.01), 
and a 2.6-fold lower viral RNA load (P = 0.01) at approximately 2.3 years after 
seroconversion compared with CCR5 wild-type homozygotes. At the end of the 
study, both groups showed the same prevalence of syncytium-inducing HIV-1, but 
CCR5 delta 32 heterozygotes had a delayed conversion rate. The protective effect 
of CCR5 delta 32 heterozygosity was stronger in the presence of only 
non-syncytium-inducing HIV-1. The CCR5 genotype predicted disease progression 
independent of viral RNA load, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, T-lymphocyte function, 
and HIV-1 biological phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CCR5 genotype to currently available laboratory 
markers may allow better estimation of the clinical course of HIV-1 infection.

Echocardiographic identification of cardiovascular sources of emboli to guide 
clinical management of stroke: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

McNamara RL(1), Lima JA, Whelton PK, Powe NR.

Author information:
(1)Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Johns Hopkins University School of 
Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

BACKGROUND: No consensus exists about the use of imaging strategies to identify 
potential cardiovascular sources of emboli in patients who have had strokes.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of various cardiac imaging 
strategies after stroke.
DESIGN: A markov model decision analysis was used to evaluate the benefits and 
costs of nine diagnostic strategies, including transthoracic echocardiography, 
transesophageal echocardiography, sequential approaches, selective imaging, and 
no imaging.
SETTING: Simulated clinical practice in the United States.
PATIENTS: Hypothetical patients with a first stroke who were in normal sinus 
rhythm.
MEASUREMENTS: Echocardiographic detection rates of potential sources of emboli 
were ascertained by doing a systematic review of the literature. Values for 
event rates, anticoagulation effects, utilities, and costs were obtained from 
the literature and Medicare data.
RESULTS: When visualized left atrial thrombus was used as the only indication 
for anticoagulation, transesophageal echocardiography performed only in patients 
with a history of cardiac problems cost $9000 per quality-adjusted life-year; 
transesophageal echocardiography in all patients cost $13,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year. Cost savings and decreased morbidity and mortality 
rates associated with reduction in preventable recurrent strokes substantially 
offset examination costs and risks of anticoagulation. These results were 
moderately sensitive to efficacy of anticoagulation and incidence of 
intracranial bleeding during anticoagulation and were mildly sensitive to 
prevalence of left atrial thrombus, rate of recurrent stroke in patients with 
thrombus, quality of life after stroke, cost of transesophageal 
echocardiography, and specificity of transesophageal echocardiography. 
Transthoracic echocardiography, alone or in sequence with transesophageal 
echocardiography, was not cost-effective compared with transesophageal 
echocardiography.
CONCLUSION: Physicians should consider doing transesophageal echocardiography in 
all patients with new-onset stroke.

Transversal and longitudinal studies of the natural patterns of food intake were 
made in male (n = 65) and female (n = 52) Lou rats, from 4 to 34 months of age. 
The efficiency of body weight control, especially for females, seems to be a 
main feature of this strain of rat: these rats are small eaters, have lighter 
body weight, show no development of obesity with age, and have a longer life 
expectancy than other common strains of rat. A better adaptation to feeding 
schedules was shown by female groups throughout the experiments. Moreover, an 
increased consumption for the oldest animals (from 28 months) enables them to 
keep their body weight constant up to age 34 months, whereas the male rats 
gradually lost weight with old age (from 28 months). When male and female rats 
of different age groups were allowed to choose their diet from pure 
macronutrient sources (protein, fat, and carbohydrate), an age-related shift of 
preferences from carbohydrate to fat diets was evidenced during daily energy 
intake. Protein intake also decreased according to age, earlier for males 
(around 21 months) than for females (34 months).

Regional distribution of the anticonvulsant and behavioural effects of 
bicuculline injected into the pontine reticular formation of rats.

Previous experimental work has established that activation of sites in the 
dorsal midbrain can suppress tonic hindlimb extension in the electroshock model 
of epilepsy. The most sensitive region for this effect is centred on the 
intercollicular area and is referred to as the dorsal midbrain anticonvulsant 
zone (DMAZ). Subsequent experiments have shown that the ipsilateral descending 
projection from this region to the ventrolateral pons is critically involved in 
mediating its tonic seizure-suppressing properties. The purpose of the present 
investigation was to test whether direct anticonvulsant effects in the 
electroshock model could be obtained from selective manipulation of DMAZ target 
regions in the ventrolateral pons. Animals were prepared with chronically 
implanted guide cannulae through which microinjections could be made directly 
into the lateral pontine reticular formation. Animals received injections of 
saline or bicuculline (25-100 pmol) administered either bilaterally or 
unilaterally. The effects of these injections on the animals' behaviour were 
determined in an open arena, after which maximal electroshock (1 s, 40 mA, 50 Hz 
AC) was administered via ear-clip electrodes and the duration of tonic hindlimb 
extension was recorded. Bilateral injections of bicuculline (100 pmol) 
suppressed tonic seizures at a significantly higher proportion of sites centred 
on DMAZ target regions of the ventrolateral pons than surrounding areas. For 
injections centred on this region the suppressive effects of bicuculline were 
dose-related in the range 25-100 pmol. Unilateral injections of bicuculline into 
the ventrolateral pons also effectively suppressed tonic seizures in the 
electroshock model. Within the ventral pons there was a significant association 
between the behavioural and anticonvulsant effects of bicuculline; injections 
suppressing tonic seizures were associated with the induction of fast continuous 
locomotor activity. These data confirm that the DMAZ recipient region of the 
ventrolateral pontine reticular formation is part of a circuit which can 
suppress the manifestation of tonic hindlimb extension in the electroshock 
model. Whether this property is related to the participation of this region in 
normal locomotion and posture remains to be determined.

11 beta-hydroxylase (Cyp11b1) mutations were previously linked to altered 
steroid biosynthesis and blood pressure in Dahl salt-resistant (R) and Dahl 
salt-sensitive (S) rats. In the present work, interval mapping identified a 
putative blood pressure quantitative trait locus (QTL) near Cyp11b1 in an 
F1(SxR)xS population (LOD = 2.0). Congenic rats (Designated S.R-Cyp11b) were 
constructed by introgressing the R-rat Cyp11b1 allele into the S strain. 
S.R-Cyp11b rats had significantly lower blood pressure and heart weight compared 
with S rats, proving the existence of a blood pressure QTL on Chromosome (Chr) 7 
despite the fact that QTL linkage analysis of blood pressure never achieved 
stringent statistical criteria for significance. To test the effects of the 
introgressed region on blood pressure and survival, S.R.-Cyp11b and S rats were 
maintained on a 4% NaCl diet until they died or became moribund. Analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) indicated significant strain differences in blood pressure and 
days survived (P < 0.0001 for both) as well as gender differences in days 
survived (P = 0.0003). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also found significant 
strain (P < 0.0001) and gender (P = 0.007) differences in days survived. 
However, when the effects of blood pressure were removed, significant strain 
differences in survival essentially disappeared. This suggests that the 
increased survival of S.R-Cyp11b rats was largely due to their decreased blood 
pressure and thus strongly corroborates the existence of a blood pressure QTL on 
Chr 7 near or at Cyp11b1.

The protective impact of a covariate on competing failures with an example from 
a bone marrow transplantation study.

Di Serio C(1).

Author information:

Starting from an applied Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) study, the problem of 
"unexpected protectivity" in competing risks models is introduced, which occurs 
when one covariate shows a protective impact not expected from a medical 
perspective. Current explanations found in the statistical literature suggest 
that unexpected protectivity might be due to the lack of independence between 
the competing failures. Actually, in the presence of dependence, the 
Kaplan-Meier curves are not interpretable. Conversely, the cumulative incidence 
curves remain interpretable, and therefore seem to be a candidate for solving 
the problem. We discuss the particular nature of dependence in a competing risks 
framework and illustrate how this dependence may be created via a common frailty 
factor. A Monte Carlo experiment is set up which accounts also for the 
association between the observable covariates and the frailty factor. The aim of 
the experiment is to understand whether and how the bias showed by the estimates 
could be related to the omitted frailty variable. The results show that 
dependence alone does not cause false protectivity, and that the cumulative 
incidence curves suffer the same bias as the survival curves and therefore do 
not seem to be a solution to false protectivity. Conversely, false protectivity 
may occur according to the magnitude and the sign of the dependence between the 
frailty factor and the covariate. The paper ends with some suggestions for 
empirical research.

Frequently in the analysis of survival data, survival times within the same 
group are correlated due to unobserved co-variates. One way these co-variates 
can be included in the model is as frailties. These frailty random block effects 
generate dependency between the survival times of the individuals which are 
conditionally independent given the frailty. Using a conditional proportional 
hazards model, in conjunction with the frailty, a whole new family of models is 
introduced. By considering a gamma frailty model, often the issue is to find an 
appropriate model for the baseline hazard function. In this paper a flexible 
baseline hazard model based on a correlated prior process is proposed and is 
compared with a standard Weibull model. Several model diagnostics methods are 
developed and model comparison is made using recently developed Bayesian model 
selection criteria. The above methodologies are applied to the McGilchrist and 
Aisbett (1991) kidney infection data and the analysis is performed using Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Multiple time scales and the lifetime coefficient of variation: engineering 
applications.

Kordonsky KB(1), Gertsbakh I.

Author information:

We consider linear combinations of "natural" time scales and choose the "best" 
one which provides the minimum coefficient of variation of the lifetime. Our 
time scale is in fact a generalized Miner time scale because the latter is based 
on an appropriate weighting of the times spent on low and high level loadings. 
The suggested modus operandi for finding the "best" time scale has many features 
in common with the approach suggested by Farewell and Cox (1979) and Oakes 
(1995) which is devoted to multiple time scales in survival analysis.

Bootstrapping regression parameters in multivariate survival analysis.

Loughin TM(1), Koehler KJ.

Author information:

Bootstrap methods are proposed for estimating sampling distributions and 
associated statistics for regression parameters in multivariate survival data. 
We use an Independence Working Model (IWM) approach, fitting margins 
independently, to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters in the marginal 
models. Resampling procedures, however, are applied to an appropriate joint 
distribution to estimate covariance matrices, make bias corrections, and 
construct confidence intervals. The proposed methods allow for fixed or random 
explanatory variables, the latter case using extensions of existing resampling 
schemes (Loughin, 1995), and they permit the possibility of random censoring. An 
application is shown for the viral positivity time data previously analyzed by 
Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld (1989). A simulation study of small-sample properties 
shows that the proposed bootstrap procedures provide substantial improvements in 
variance estimation over the robust variance estimator commonly used with the 
IWM.

Lifetime assessment by intermittent inspection under the mixture Weibull power 
law model with application to XLPE cables.

Hirose H(1).

Author information:
(1)Hiroshima City University, Faculty of Information Sciences, Japan.

This paper proposes a new treatment for electrical insulation degradation. Some 
types of insulation which have been used under various circumstances are 
considered to degrade at various rates in accordance with their stress 
circumstances. The cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated cables inspected 
by major Japanese electric companies clearly indicate such phenomena. By 
assuming that the inspected specimen is sampled from one of the clustered 
groups, a mixed degradation model can be constructed. Since the degradation of 
the insulation under common circumstances is considered to follow a Weibull 
distribution, a mixture model and a Weibull power law can be combined. This is 
called The mixture Weibull power law model. By using the maximum likelihood 
estimation for the newly proposed model to Japanese 22 and 33 kV insulation 
class cables, they are clustered into a certain number of groups by using the 
AIC and the generalized likelihood ratio test method. The reliability of the 
cables at specified years are assessed.

The large sample distribution of the weighted log rank statistic under general 
local alternatives.

We derive the large sample distribution of the weighted log rank statistic under 
a general class of local alternatives in which both the cure rates and the 
conditional distribution of time to failure among those who fail are assumed to 
vary in the two treatment arms. The analytic result presented here is important 
to data analysts who are designing clinical trials for diseases such as 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, leukemia and melanoma, where a significant proportion of 
patients are cured. We present a numerical illustration comparing powers 
obtained from the analytic result to those obtained from simulations.

Research on methods for studying time-to-event data (survival analysis) has been 
extensive in recent years. The basic model in use today represents the hazard 
function for an individual through a proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972). 
Typically, it is assumed that a covariate's effect on the hazard function is 
constant throughout the course of the study. In this paper we propose a method 
to allow for possible deviations from the standard Cox model, by allowing the 
effect of a covariate to vary over time. This method is based on a dynamic 
linear model. We present our method in terms of a Bayesian hierarchical model. 
We fit the model to the data using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Finally, we 
illustrate the approach with several examples.

Modelling accelerated degradation data using Wiener diffusion with a time scale 
transformation.

Whitmore GA(1), Schenkelberg F.

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Engineering degradation tests allow industry to assess the potential life span 
of long-life products that do not fail readily under accelerated conditions in 
life tests. A general statistical model is presented here for performance 
degradation of an item of equipment. The degradation process in the model is 
taken to be a Wiener diffusion process with a time scale transformation. The 
model incorporates Arrhenius extrapolation for high stress testing. The lifetime 
of an item is defined as the time until performance deteriorates to a specified 
failure threshold. The model can be used to predict the lifetime of an item or 
the extent of degradation of an item at a specified future time. Inference 
methods for the model parameters, based on accelerated degradation test data, 
are presented. The model and inference methods are illustrated with a case 
application involving self-regulating heating cables. The paper also discusses a 
number of practical issues encountered in applications.

Probabilistic investigation of the life behavior of power capacitors operating 
under distorted supply voltage.

Cavallini A(1), Mazzanti G, Montanari GC.

Author information:
(1)Istituto di Ingegneria, University of Ferrara, Italy.

A probabilistic approach to the problem of life evaluation of power capacitors 
subjected to non-sinusoidal voltage is presented. In order to account for the 
stochastic nature of harmonic distortion, a probability density function 
representing the random occurrency of non-sinusoidal voltages is employed, while 
the stress-failure time relationship is provided by a multi-stress life model 
appropriate for life evaluation of a polymeric insulation. In such a way, the 
knowledge of harmonic amplitude distributions provides that of stresses 
affecting insulation life, i.e. electric field and temperature. Thus, life 
evaluation under distorted supply voltage is allowed, and comparison can be made 
with respect to performance in sinusoidal conditions.

In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach for inference from accelerated 
life tests when the underlying life model is Weibull. Our approach is based on 
the General Linear Models framework of West, Harrison and Migon (1985). We 
discuss inference for the model and show that computable results can be obtained 
using linear Bayesian methods. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by 
applying it to some actual data from accelerated life tests.

Estimation with interval censored data and covariates.

Van der Laan MJ(1), Hubbard A.

Author information:
(1)Division of Biostatistics, University of California, Berkeley, USA.

In biostatistical applications interest often focuses on the estimation of the 
distribution of time T between two consecutive events. If the initial event time 
is observed and the subsequent event time is only known to be larger or smaller 
than an observed monitoring time C, then the data conforms to the well 
understood singly-censored current status model, also known as interval censored 
data, case I. Additional covariates can be used to allow for dependent censoring 
and to improve estimation of the marginal distribution of T. Assuming a wrong 
model for the conditional distribution of T, given the covariates, will lead to 
an inconsistent estimator of the marginal distribution. On the other hand, the 
nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of FT requires splitting up the 
sample in several subsamples corresponding with a particular value of the 
covariates, computing the NPMLE for every subsample and then taking an average. 
With a few continuous covariates the performance of the resulting estimator is 
typically miserable. In van der Laan, Robins (1996) a locally efficient one-step 
estimator is proposed for smooth functionals of the distribution of T, assuming 
nothing about the conditional distribution of T, given the covariates, but 
assuming a model for censoring, given the covariates. The estimators are 
asymptotically linear if the censoring mechanism is estimated correctly. The 
estimator also uses an estimator of the conditional distribution of T, given the 
covariates. If this estimate is consistent, then the estimator is efficient and 
if it is inconsistent, then the estimator is still consistent and asymptotically 
normal. In this paper we show that the estimators can also be used to estimate 
the distribution function in a locally optimal way. Moreover, we show that the 
proposed estimator can be used to estimate the distribution based on interval 
censored data (T is now known to lie between two observed points) in the 
presence of covariates. The resulting estimator also has a known influence curve 
so that asymptotic confidence intervals are directly available. In particular, 
one can apply our proposal to the interval censored data without covariates. In 
Geskus (1992) the information bound for interval censored data with two 
uniformly distributed monitoring times at the uniform distribution (for T) has 
been computed. We show that the relative efficiency of our proposal w.r.t. this 
optimal bound equals 0.994, which is also reflected in finite sample 
simulations. Finally, the good practical performance of the estimator is shown 
in a simulation study.

A method for checking regression models in survival analysis based on the risk 
score.

Author information:

We propose to perform model check for the Cox and Aalen regression models using 
martingale residual processes grouped after the risk score. Asymptotic 
distributions of the grouped martingale residual processes are deduced, so both 
formal and graphical model check can be performed. The method is validated by 
stochastic simulation. A data example with patients with primary biliary 
cirrhosis of the liver is discussed.

Multilevel models for longitudinal variables prognostic for survival.

De Stavola BL(1), Christensen E.

Author information:
(1)Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, London School of Hygiene 
and Tropical Medicine, UK.

The issue of modelling the joint distribution of survival time and of prognostic 
variables measured periodically has recently become of interest in the AIDS 
literature but is of relevance in other applications. The focus of this paper is 
on clinical trials where follow-up measurements of potentially prognostic 
variables are often collected but not routinely used. These measurements can be 
used to study the biological evolution of the disease of interest; in particular 
the effect of an active treatment can be examined by comparing the time profiles 
of patients in the active and placebo group. It is proposed to use multilevel 
regression analysis to model the individual repeated observations as function of 
time and, possibly, treatment. To address the problem of informative 
drop-out--which may arise if deaths (or any other censoring events) are related 
to the unobserved values of the prognostic variables--we analyse sequentially 
overlapping portions of the follow-up information. An example arising from a 
randomized clinical trial for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis is 
examined in detail.

Families of smooth confidence bands for the survival function under the general 
random censorship model.

Gulati S(1), Padgett WJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Statistics, Florida International University, Miami 33199, USA.

Randomly right censored data often arise in industrial life testing and clinical 
trials. Several authors have proposed asymptotic confidence bands for the 
survival function when data are randomly censored on the right. All of these 
bands are based on the empirical estimator of the survival function. In this 
paper, families of asymptotic (1-alpha) 100% level confidence bands are 
developed from the smoothed estimate of the survival function under the general 
random censorship model. The new bands are compared to empirical bands, and it 
is shown that for small sample sizes, the smooth bands have a higher coverage 
probability than the empirical counterparts.

Nonparametric estimation of the limiting availability.

Author information:
(1)Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, State University of New 
York at Stony Brook 11794, USA.

The point availability of a repairable system is the probability that the system 
is operating at a specified time. As time increases, the point availability 
converges to a positive constant called the limiting availability. Baxter and Li 
(1994a) developed a technique for constructing nonparametric confidence 
intervals for the point availability. However, nonparametric estimators of the 
limiting availability have not previously been studied in the literature. In 
this paper, we consider two separate cases: (1) the data are complete and (2) 
the data are subject to right censorship. For each case, a nonparametric 
confidence interval for the limiting availability is derived. Applications and 
simulation studies are presented.
