relationship exists between infant mortality and failure to thrive (or 
unthriftiness), and umbilical 5-HT concentration in piglets. Umbilical blood was 
collected from a total of 60 piglets from 15 litters for analysis of 5-HT and 
tryptophan (Trp; the AA precursor to 5-HT) concentrations. Behavior was scan 
sampled for the first 2 days after birth. Brain samples were also taken at 8 h 
after birth from healthy and unthrifty piglets (n = 4/group). The raphe nucleus 
was dissected out and analyzed for 5-HT and dopamine concentrations as well as 
their major metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic 
acid (HVA), respectively. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Piglets that died within 
48 h of birth (n = 14) had significantly lower umbilical blood 5-HT 
concentrations at the time of their birth compared to their healthy counterparts 
(n = 46, P = 0.003). However, no difference in Trp was detected (P 0.38). Time 
spent under the heat lamp and sleeping were positively correlated with umbilical 
5-HT levels (P = 0.004 and P = 0.02, respectively), while inactivity had a 
negative correlation with 5-HT levels (P = 0.04). In the raphe nucleus, the 
center for brain 5-HT biosynthesis, unthrifty piglets had a greater 
concentration of 5-HIAA (P = 0.02) and a trend for higher concentrations of 5-HT 
(P = 0.07) compared with healthy piglets. Dopamine levels did not differ between 
thrifty and unthrifty piglets (P = 0.45); however, its metabolite HVA tended to 
be greater in unthrifty piglets (P = 0.05). Our results show evidence of 
serotonergic dysfunction, at both the central and peripheral levels, 
accompanying early piglet mortalities. These data suggest a possible route for 
intervention, via the 5-HT system, to improve piglet survivability. However, 
further research is required to validate this hypothesis.

Feeding behavior has the potential to enhance prediction of feed intake and to 
improve understanding of the relationships between behavior, DMI, ADG, and 
residual feed intake (RFI) in beef cattle. Two cohorts, born in 2009 and 2010, 
the progeny of Red Angus bulls (n = 58 heifers and n = 53 steers), were 
evaluated during the growing phase, and the latter group of steers was also 
evaluated during the finishing phase. All behavior analyses were based on 7 
feeding behavior traits (bunk visit frequency, bunk visit duration [BVDUR], feed 
bout frequency, feed bout duration, meal frequency, meal duration, and average 
meal intake) and their relationships with ADG, DMI, and RFI. During the growing 
phase, feeding duration traits were most indicative of DMI with positive 
correlations between BVDUR and DMI for cohort 1 steers, growing phase (n = 28, r 
= 0.52, P = 0.00); cohort 2 steers, growing phase (n = 25, r = 0.44, P = 0.01); 
and cohort 2 heifers, growing phase (n = 29, r = 0.28 P = 0.05). There were 
similar trends toward correlation of BVDUR and RFI for both steer groups and 
cohort 1 heifers, growing phase (C1HG; n = 29; r = 0.27, P = 0.06; r = 0.30, P = 
0.07; and r = 0.26, P = 0.08, respectively). Feed bout frequency was correlated 
with ADG in C1HG and in cohort 2 steers, finishing phase (r = -0.31, P = 0.04, 
and r = 0.43, P = 0.01, respectively). Feed bout duration was correlated with 
ADG in heifer groups (r = 0.29 and r = 0.28, P = 0.05 for both groups) and DMI 
for all growing phase animals (r = 0.29 to 0.55, P ≤ 0.05 for all groups). 
Evaluation of growing vs. finishing phase steer groups suggests that all 
behaviors, RFI, and DMI, but not ADG, are correlated through the growing and 
finishing phases (P ≤ 0.01 for all variables excluding ADG), implying that 
feeding behaviors determined during the growing phase are strong predictors of 
DMI in either life stage. Sire maintenance energy EPD effects (measured as high 
or low groups) on progeny feeding behaviors revealed a difference in meal 
duration with a tendency to differ in average meal intake (P = 0.01 and P = 
0.07, respectively). Feeding behavior duration traits may be useful predictors 
of DMI in Red Angus cattle.

The Latin American Dialysis and Renal Transplant Registry (RLADTR) was founded 
in 1991; it collects data from 20 countries which are members of Sociedad 
Latinoamericana de Nefrología e Hipertension. This paper presents the results 
corresponding to the year 2010. This study is an annual survey requesting data 
on incident and prevalent patients undergoing renal replacement treatment (RRT) 
in all modalities: hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and living with a 
functioning graft (LFG), etc. Prevalence and incidence were compared with 
previous years. The type of renal replacement therapy was analyzed, with special 
emphasis on PD and transplant (Tx). These variables were correlated with the 
gross national income (GNI) and the life expectancy at birth. Twenty countries 
participed in the surveys, covering 99% of the Latin American. The prevalence of 
end stage renal disease (ESRD) under RRT in Latin America (LA) increased from 
119 patients per million population (pmp) in 1991 to 660 pmp in 2010 (HD 413 
pmp, PD 135 pmp and LFG 111 pmp). HD proportionally increased more than PD, and 
Tx HD continues to be the treatment of choice in the region (75%). The kidney Tx 
rate increased from 3.7 pmp in 1987 to 6.9 pmp in 1991 and to 19.1 in 2010. The 
total number of Tx's in 2010 was 10 397, with 58% deceased donors. The total RRT 
prevalence correlated positively with GNI (r2 0.86; P < 0.05) and life 
expectancy at birth (r2 0.58; P < 0.05). The HD prevalence and the kidney Tx 
rate correlated significantly with the same indexes, whereas the PD rate showed 
no correlation with these variables. A tendency to rate stabilization/little 
growth was reported in the most regional countries. As in previous reports, the 
global incidence rate correlated significantly only with GNI (r2 0.63; P < 
0.05). Diabetes remained the leading cause of ESRD. The most frequent causes of 
death were cardiovascular (45%) and infections (22%). Neoplasms accounted for 
10% of the causes of death. The prevalence of RRT continues to increase, 
particularly in countries with 100% public health or insurance coverage for RRT, 
where it approaches rates comparable to those displayed by developed countries 
with a better GNI. The incidence also continues to increase in both countries 
that have not yet extended its coverage to 100% of the population as well as in 
those that have an adequate program for timely detection and treatment of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its associated risk factors. PD is still an 
underutilized strategy for RRT in the region. Even though renal Tx is feasible, 
its growth rate is still not as fast as it should be in order to compensate for 
the increased prevalence of patients on waiting lists. Diagnostic and prevention 
programs for hypertension and diabetes, appropriate policies promoting the 
expansion of PD and organ procurement as well as transplantation as 
cost-effective forms of RRT are needed in the region. Regional cooperation among 
Latin American countries, allowing the more developed to guide and train others 
in starting registries and CKD programs, may be one of the key initiatives to 
address this deficit.

Developmental timing of the male-female health-survival paradox.

Draper TW(1), Abrahamson H.

Author information:
(1)1 School of Family Life, Brigham Young University.

A sample of 200,000 men and women was used to examine the paradoxical 
observation that in old age there are more women than men but the men are in 
better health. Insofar as subsequent one-year survivability can be used as an 
index of health, the paradox was partially supported. After 99 years of age, 
there was a period of time when men's health compared to women's was improving 
relative to what it was previously. But there was never a time when it was 
actually better. The possibilities remain that earlier reports of the paradox 
might be the result of (a) sample limitations, (b) a focus on types of health 
that are unrelated to subsequent survival, or (c) local behaviors or conditions, 
such as smoking or air pollution, that can influence the health of men and women 
differently.

The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alfa and 
ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in children and young people: 
a systematic review and economic evaluation.

Southampton, Southampton, UK.

BACKGROUND: Optimal therapy for children with chronic hepatitis C is unclear. 
Two treatment regimens are currently licensed in children.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys®, Roche) and peginterferon alfa-2b 
[ViraferonPeg®, Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD)] in combination with ribavirin (RBV), 
within their licensed indications, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) in children and young people aged 3-17 years.
DATA SOURCES: Twelve electronic bibliographic databases, including The Cochrane 
Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched from inception to November 2012. 
Bibliographies of retrieved papers, key hepatitis C websites and symposia and 
manufacturers' submissions to the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence were also searched, and clinical experts were contacted.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness were conducted, including studies of health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL), following standard guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. 
Clinical effectiveness studies were included if they were in children and young 
people aged 3-17 years with chronic compensated HCV of any severity, including 
those with human immunodeficiency virus co-infection and those who were 
treatment naive or had been previously treated. Eligible interventions were 
peginterferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2b, each in combination with RBV, 
compared against best supportive care (BSC) or against each other, and study 
designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs, or uncontrolled 
cohort studies. Outcomes included sustained virological response (SVR) and 
adverse events. Previously published Markov state-transition economic models of 
chronic HCV in adults were adapted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
peginterferon alfa-2a and -2b (in combination with RBV), compared with BSC and 
with one another in children. The model extrapolated the impact of SVR on life 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and lifetime costs. Uncertainty was 
explored through probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Seven studies [two peginterferon alfa-2a and RBV (Copegus®, Roche), and 
five peginterferon alfa-2b and RBV (Rebetol®, MSD)] were included in the review 
of clinical effectiveness. Six were single-arm cohort studies and one was a RCT 
for which only those data for a single arm met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 
the studies were relatively small and of generally poor quality. SVR rates 
ranged from 53% to 66% (peginterferon alfa-2a) and 29% to 75% (peginterferon 
alfa-2b) (49% to 65% if excluding two studies with very small sample sizes). 
Rates of non-response and relapse were variable and adverse events were 
generally mild. No studies of cost-effectiveness or HRQoL in children and young 
people met the inclusion criteria. HRQoL, utilities and costs of treatment were 
therefore taken from studies of adults with chronic HCV. From this model, 
peginterferon alfa (-2a or -2b) in combination with RBV was more effective and 
had lower lifetime costs than BSC. Peginterferon alfa-2a had slightly lower 
lifetime costs and higher quality-adjusted life-years than peginterferon 
alfa-2b; therefore, peginterferon alfa-2b was dominated by peginterferon 
alfa-2a. Results were robust to changes in the sensitivity analyses.
LIMITATIONS: There were few good quality studies and parameter data had to be 
taken from adult studies, which is a limitation of the work.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of children and young people with peginterferon (alfa-2a 
or -2b) and RBV may be an effective therapy. Results from the independent Markov 
model suggest that peginterferon (alfa-2a or -2b) in combination with RBV is 
cost-effective compared with BSC. However, the available evidence is of poor 
quality. Future research into the impact of these treatments on growth and 
quality of life in children and young people is recommended.

Hospital , Avellino , Italy.

OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous correction of mitral regurgitation (MR) by MitraClip 
(Abbot Vascular, Abbot Park, Illinois, USA) trans-catheter procedure (MTP) may 
represent a treatment for an unmet need in heart failure (HF), but with a 
largely unclear economic impact.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study estimated the economic impact of the MTP 
in common practice using the disease-related group (DRG) billing system, 
duration and average cost per day of hospitalization as main drivers. Life 
expectancy was estimated based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model. 
Quality-of-life was derived by standard questionnaires to compute 
quality-adjusted year-life costs.
RESULTS: Over 5535 discharges between 2012-2013, HF as DRG 127 was the main 
diagnosis in 20%, yielding a reimbursement of €3052.00/case; among the DRG 127, 
MR by ICD-9 coding was found in 12%. Duration of hospitalization was longer for 
DRG 127 with than without MR (9 vs 8 days, p < 0.05). HF in-hospital management 
generated most frequently deficit, in particular in the presence of MR, due to 
the high costs of hospitalization, higher than reimbursement. MTP to treat MR 
allowed DRG 104-related reimbursement of €24,675.00. In a cohort of 34 HF 
patients treated for MR by MTP, the global budget consumption was 2-fold higher 
compared to that simulated for those cases medically managed at 2-year 
follow-up. Extrapolated cost per quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) for MTP at 
year-2 follow-up was ∼ €16,300.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on DRG and hospitalization costing estimates, MTP might be 
cost-effective in selected HF patients with MR suitable for such a specific 
treatment, granted that those patients have a clinical profile predicting high 
likelihood of post-procedural clinical stability in sufficiently long follow-up.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who smoke are at a higher risk of 
flaring and requiring surgery. Cost-effectiveness studies of funding smoking 
cessation programs are lacking. Thus, we performed a cost-utility analysis of 
funding smoking cessation programs for CD.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing five smoking cessation 
strategies: No Program, Counseling, Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), 
NRT+Counseling, and Varenicline. The time horizon for the Markov model was 5 
years. The health states included medical remission (azathioprine or antitumor 
necrosis factor (anti-TNF), dose escalation of an anti-TNF, second anti-TNF, 
surgery, and death. Probabilities were taken from peer-reviewed literature, and 
costs (CAN$) for surgery, medications, and smoking cessation programs were 
estimated locally. The primary outcome was the cost per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained associated with each smoking cessation strategy. Threshold, 
three-way sensitivity, probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), and budget 
impact analysis (BIA) were carried out.
RESULTS: All strategies dominated No Program. Strategies from most to least cost 
effective were as follows: Varenicline (cost: $55,614, QALY: 3.70), 
NRT+Counseling (cost: $58,878, QALY: 3.69), NRT (cost: $59,540, QALY: 3.69), 
Counseling (cost: $61,029, QALY: 3.68), and No Program (cost: $63,601, QALY: 
3.67). Three-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that No Program was only more 
cost effective when every strategy's cost exceeded approximately 10 times their 
estimated costs. The PSA showed that No Program was the most cost-effective <1% 
of the time. The BIA showed that any strategy saved the health-care system money 
over No Program.
CONCLUSIONS: Health-care systems should consider funding smoking cessation 
programs for CD, as they improve health outcomes and reduce costs.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is initially treated with methotrexate and 
other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Active RA patients who 
fail such treatments can receive tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), 
which are effective but expensive.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether or not combination DMARDs (cDMARDs) give 
equivalent clinical benefits at lower costs in RA patients eligible for TNFis.
DESIGN: An open-label, 12-month, pragmatic, randomised, multicentre, two-arm 
trial [Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors Against Combination Intensive Therapy 
(TACIT)] compared these treatment strategies. We then systematically reviewed 
all comparable published trials.
SETTING: The TACIT trial involved 24 English rheumatology clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: Active RA patients eligible for TNFis.
INTERVENTIONS: The TACIT trial compared cDMARDs with TNFis plus methotrexate or 
another DMARD; 6-month non-responders received (a) TNFis if in the cDMARD group; 
and (b) a second TNFi if in the TNFi group.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was the primary 
outcome measure. The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), joint 
damage, Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints (DAS28), withdrawals and adverse 
effects were secondary outcome measures. Economic evaluation linked costs, HAQ 
changes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In total, 432 patients were screened; 104 started on cDMARDs and 101 
started on TNFis. The initial demographic and disease assessments were similar 
between the groups. In total, 16 patients were lost to follow-up (nine in the 
cDMARD group, seven in the TNFi group) and 42 discontinued their intervention 
but were followed up (23 in the cDMARD group and 19 in the TNFi group). 
Intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation methods used for missing 
data showed greater 12-month HAQ score reductions with initial cDMARDs than with 
initial TNFis [adjusted linear regression coefficient 0.15, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) -0.003 to 0.31; p = 0.046]. Increases in 12-month EQ-5D scores 
were greater with initial cDMARDs (adjusted linear regression coefficient -0.11, 
95% CI -0.18 to -0.03; p = 0.009) whereas 6-month changes in HAQ and EQ-5D 
scores and 6- and 12-month changes in joint damage were similar between the 
initial cDMARD group and the initial TNFi group. Longitudinal analyses (adjusted 
general estimating equations) showed that the DAS28 was lower in the initial 
TNFi group in the first 6 months (coefficient -0.63, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.34; 
p < 0.001) but there were no differences between the groups in months 6-12. In 
total, 36 patients in the initial cDMARD group and 44 in the initial TNFi group 
achieved DAS28 remission. The onset of remission did not differ between groups 
(p = 0.085 on log-rank test). In total, 10 patients in the initial cDMARD group 
and 18 in the initial TNFi group experienced serious adverse events; stopping 
therapy because of toxicity occurred in 10 and six patients respectively. 
Economic evaluation showed that the cDMARD group had similar or better QALY 
outcomes than TNFi with significantly lower costs at 6 and 12 months. In the 
systematic reviews we identified 32 trials (including 20-1049 patients) on early 
RA and 19 trials (including 40-982 patients) on established RA that compared (1) 
cDMARDs with DMARD monotherapy; (2) TNFis/methotrexate with methotrexate 
monotherapy; and (3) cDMARDs with TNFis/methotrexate. They showed that cDMARDs 
and TNFis had similar efficacies and toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Active RA patients who have failed methotrexate and another DMARD 
achieve equivalent clinical benefits at a lower cost from starting cDMARDs or 
from starting TNFis (reserving TNFis for non-responders). Only a minority of 
patients achieve sustained remission with cDMARDs or TNFis; new strategies are 
needed to maximise the frequency of remission.

AIM: In the 1990s, several studies noted a large gap in life expectancy between 
Western and Eastern European countries. It was speculated that this could be 
explained by environmental pollution, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle and 
psychosocial stress. A weakness in addressing the issue has been the lack of 
prospective studies with mortality as end point.
METHODS: We used the national population registries (between 1996 and 1998) to 
screen a cohort of 269 55-year-old subjects in Sweden and Estonia. We assessed 
conventional risk factors, lifestyle and socio-economic factors. A 13-year 
follow-up regarding all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was done.
RESULTS: Smoking and, to a lesser extent, plasma levels of interleukin-6 were 
significant predictors for CVD and non-CVD mortality in men, but none of the 
other conventional risk factors reached statistical significance. During the 
follow-up period, 22 of the 52 male smokers died compared to 8 of the 85 male 
non-smokers (p<0.01). Ten of the smokers died of CVD compared to three of the 
non-smokers (p<0.002). In total, only two women died.
CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize that smoking prevention is extremely important 
in preventing premature death. Although smoking prevalence is diminishing, it is 
still the most important risk factor to treat.

Do value thresholds for oncology drugs differ from nononcology drugs?

Bae YH(1), Mullins CD.

Author information:

St., Pomona, CA 91766. hbae@westernu.edu.

BACKGROUND: In the past decade, many oncologic drugs have been approved that 
extend life and/or improve patients' quality of life. However, new cancer drugs 
are often associated with high price and increased medical spending. For 
example, in 2010, the average annual cost of care for breast cancer in the final 
stage of disease was reported to be $94,284, and the total estimated cost in the 
United States was $16.50 billion.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether value threshold, as defined by the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), differed between oncology and other therapeutic 
areas. 
METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for articles published between January 
2003 and December 2013 with calculated ICER for therapeutic drug entities in a 
specific therapeutic area. The search term used was "ICER" and "United States." 
From 275 results, only those articles that reported ICERs using quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) were included. In addition, only those articles that used a 
U.S. payer perspective were retained. Among those, nondrug therapy articles and 
review articles were excluded. The mean ICER and value threshold for oncologic 
drugs and nononcologic drugs were evaluated for the analysis. 
RESULTS: From 54 articles selected for analysis, 13 pertained to drugs in 
oncology therapeutics, and the remaining 41 articles addressed ICER for drugs in 
other therapeutic areas. The mean and median of ICERs calculated for 
cancer-specific drug intervention was $138,582/QALY and $55,500/QALY, 
respectively, compared with $49,913/QALY and $31,000/QALY, respectively, for 
noncancer drugs. Among the cancer drugs, 45.0% had ICERs below $50,000/QALY and 
70.0% below $100,000/QALY. In comparison, 72.0% of noncancer drugs showed ICERs 
below $50,000/QALY, and 90.0% had ICERs below $100,000/QALY. When a specific 
threshold was mentioned, it was in the range of $100,000-$150,000 in cancer 
drugs, whereas drugs in other therapeutic areas used traditional threshold value 
within the range of $50,000-$100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The average ICER reported for cancer drugs was more than 2-fold 
greater than the average ICER for noncancer drugs. In general, articles that 
addressed the relative value of oncologic pharmaceuticals used higher value 
thresholds and reported higher ICERs than articles evaluating noncancer drugs.

BACKGROUND: After a complex dislocation, some elbows remain unstable after 
closed reduction or fracture treatment. Function after treatment with a hinged 
external fixator theoretically allows collateral ligaments to heal without 
surgical reconstruction. However, there is a lack of prospective studies that 
assess functional outcome, pain, and ROM.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) In complex elbow fracture-dislocations, does 
treatment with a hinged external fixator result in reduction of disability and 
pain, and in improvement in ROM, function, and quality of life? (2) Does delayed 
treatment (7 days or later) have a negative effect on ROM after 1 year? (3) What 
are the complications seen after external fixator treatment?
METHODS: During a 2-year period, 11 centers recruited 27 patients 18 years or 
older who were included and evaluated at 2 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 
months after surgery as part of this prospective case series. During the study 
period, the participating centers agreed on general indications for use of the 
hinged external fixator, which included persistent instability after closed 
reduction alone or closed reduction combined with surgical treatment of 
associated fracture(s), when indicated. Functional outcome was evaluated using 
the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH; primary 
outcome) score, the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI), the Oxford Elbow Score, 
and the level of pain (VAS). ROM, adverse events, secondary interventions, and 
radiographs also were evaluated. A total of 26 of the 27 patients (96%) were 
available for followup at 1 year.
RESULTS: All functional and pain scores improved. The median QuickDASH score 
decreased from 30 (25(th)-75(th) percentiles [P25-P75], 23-40) at 6 weeks to 7 
(P25-P75, 2-12) at 1 year with a median difference of -25 (p < 0.001). The 
median MEPI score increased from 80 (P25-P75, 64-85) at 6 weeks to 100 (P25-P75, 
85-100) at 1 year with a median difference of 15 (p < 0.001). The median Oxford 
Elbow Score increased from 60 (P25-P75, 44-68) at 6 weeks to 90 (P25-P75, 73-96) 
at 1 year with a median difference of 29 (p < 0.001). The median VAS decreased 
from 2.8 (P25-P75, 1.0-5.0) at 2 weeks to 0.5 (P25-P75, 0.0-1.9) at 1 year with 
a median difference of -2.1 (p = 0.001). ROM also improved. The median 
flexion-extension arc improved from 50° (P25-P75, 33°-80°) at 2 weeks to 118° 
(P25-P75, 105°-138°) at 1 year with a median difference of 63° (p < 0.001). 
Similarly, the median pronation-supination arc improved from 90° (P25-P75, 
63°-124°) to 160° (P25-P75, 138°-170°) with a median difference of 75° (p < 
0.001). At 1 year, the median residual deficit compared with the uninjured side 
was 30° (P25-P75, 5°-35°) for the flexion-extension arc, and 3° (P25-P75, 
0°-25°) for the pronation-supination arc. Ten patients (37%) experienced a 
fixator-related complication, and seven patients required secondary surgery 
(26%). One patient reported recurrent instability.
CONCLUSIONS: A hinged external elbow fixator provides enough stability to start 
early mobilization after an acute complex elbow dislocation and residual 
instability. This was reflected in good functional outcome scores and only 
slight disability despite a relatively high complication rate.

Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an exciting new primate model for 
understanding human aging and disease. In captivity, Microcebus murinus develops 
human-like ailments of old age after five years (e.g., neurodegeneration 
analogous to Alzheimer's disease) but can live beyond 12 years. It is believed 
that wild Microcebus follow a similar pattern of senescence observed in captive 
animals, but that predation limits their lifespan to four years, thus preventing 
observance of these diseases in the wild. Testing whether this assumption is 
true is informative about both Microcebus natural history and environmental 
influences on senescence, leading to interpretation of findings for models of 
human aging. Additionally, the study of Microcebus longevity provides an 
opportunity to better understand mechanisms of sex-biased longevity. Longevity 
is often shorter in males of species with high male-male competition, such as 
Microcebus, but mouse lemurs are sexually monomorphic, suggesting similar 
lifespans. We collected individual-based observations of wild brown mouse lemurs 
(Microcebus rufus) from 2003-2010 to investigate sex-differences in survival and 
longevity. Fecal testosterone was measured as a potential mechanism of sex-based 
differences in survival. We used a combination of high-resolution tooth wear 
techniques, mark-recapture, and hormone enzyme immunoassays. We found no dental 
or physical signs of senescence in M. rufus as old as eight years (N = 189, ages 
1-8, mean = 2.59 ± 1.63 SE), three years older than captive, senescent congeners 
(M. murinus). Unlike other polygynandrous vertebrates, we found no sex 
difference in age-dependent survival, nor sex or age differences in testosterone 
levels. While elevated male testosterone levels have been implicated in shorter 
lifespans in several species, this is one of the first studies to show 
equivalent testosterone levels accompanying equivalent lifespans. Future 
research on captive aged individuals can determine if senescence is partially a 
condition of their captive environment, and studies controlling for various 
environmental factors will further our understanding of senescence.

BACKGROUND: Population aging increases the prevalence of chronic diseases. This 
morbidity impacts on the relatively high mortality levels and has disabling 
effects. Classic health indicators -life expectancy at birth and gross mortality 
rate- are complemented by the disability-free life expectancy (DFLE), whose 
advantage is a standardization of concepts, sources of information and 
calculation methods. In this investigation, the healthy life expectancy in adult 
older population with social security in Mexico is estimated.
METHODS: Life expectancy was estimated from the mortality analysis and by 
constructing life tables of the population affiliated to the Mexican Institute 
of Social Security. Chiang's method was used and the disability 
prevalence-adjusted life table was modified using Sullivan's method. The healthy 
life expectancy, life expectancy free of disability and life expectancy with 
disability in the older adult analysis was highlighted.
RESULTS: Life expectancy free of disability was estimated at 66.5 years. In 
females, it was 16 years and, in men, 15.2 years, indicating that from this age 
on they live less time with a healthy life.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy life expectancy is an indicator that can be useful to build 
scenarios to support the planning, administration and strategic management of 
healthy aging programs.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: El envejecimiento poblacional incrementa la prevalencia 
de enfermedades crónicas. Esta morbilidad incide en los niveles de mortalidad 
relativamente altos y tiene efectos discapacitantes. Los indicadores clásicos de 
salud —esperanza de vida al nacer y tasa bruta de mortalidad— se complementan 
con la esperanza de vida libre de discapacidad (EVLD), cuya ventaja es la 
estandarización de los conceptos, las fuentes de información y los métodos de 
cálculo. En esta investigación se estima la esperanza de vida saludable en 
población adulta mayor con seguridad social en México. MÉTODOS: la esperanza de 
vida se estimó a partir del análisis de la mortalidad y construcción de tablas 
de vida de la población derechohabiente del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro 
Social. Se utilizó el método de Chiang y se modificó la tabla de vida ajustada 
por la prevalencia de discapacidad mediante el método de Sullivan. Se resaltó el 
análisis de la esperanza de vida saludable, esperanza de vida libre de 
discapacidad y esperanza de vida con discapacidad en el adulto mayor.
RESULTADOS: la esperanza de vida libre de discapacidad se estimó en 66.5 años. 
En las mujeres fue de 16 años y en los hombres de 15.2 años, lo que indica que a 
partir de esta edad viven menos tiempo con vida saludable.
CONCLUSIONES: la esperanza de vida saludable es un indicador que puede ayudar a 
construir escenarios para sustentar la planeación, administración y gestión 
estratégica de programas de envejecimiento saludable.

INTRODUCTION: Mepact(®) (mifamurtide) is the first drug approved for the 
treatment of high-grade resectable non-metastatic osteosarcoma in patients aged 
2-30 in the last 20 years. It follows a randomized clinical trial showing a 
statistically-significant and clinically-relevant decrease in the risk of death 
without compromising safety.
AIM: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of 
mifamurtide.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was done on a hypothetical cohort of young 
patients under the age of 30 with high-grade, non-metastatic, resectable 
osteosarcoma. Standard chemotherapy without mifamurtide was used as comparator. 
A Markov model was adapted using Spanish costs and the results of the INT-0133 
Phase III study. The analysis has been carried out from the perspective of the 
Spanish National Health Service, with a time horizon of up to 60 years in the 
base analysis.
RESULTS: The observed greater efficacy of mifamurtide in the trial translates 
into a gain of 3.03 (undiscounted) and 1.33 (discounted) quality-adjusted life 
years at an additional cost of €102,000. The estimated budgetary impact of using 
mifamurtide in 10-100% of the potential population would cost €671,000 and €6.7 
million respectively.
CONCLUSION: The cost per quality-adjusted life years gained with mifamurtide in 
Spain is in the low band (<€100,000) of the iCERs obtained by other orphan drugs 
and would have a limited and affordable cost in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is widely applied to treat severe 
depression resistant to standard treatment. Results from previous studies 
comparing the cost-effectiveness of this technique with treatment alternatives 
such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are conflicting.
METHOD: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ECT alone, rTMS 
alone and rTMS followed by ECT when rTMS fails under the perspective of the 
Spanish National Health Service. The analysis is based on a Markov model which 
simulates the costs and health outcomes of individuals treated under these 
alternatives over a 12-month period. Data to populate this model were extracted 
and synthesized from a series of randomized controlled trials and other studies 
that have compared these techniques on the patient group of interest. We measure 
effectiveness using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and characterize the 
uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: ECT alone was found to be less costly and more effective than rTMS 
alone, while the strategy of providing rTMS followed by ECT when rTMS fails is 
the most expensive and effective option. The incremental cost per QALY gained of 
this latter strategy was found to be above the reference willingness-to-pay 
threshold used in these types of studies in Spain and other countries. The 
probability that ECT alone is the most cost-effective alternative was estimated 
to be around 70%.
CONCLUSIONS: ECT is likely to be the most cost-effective option in the treatment 
of resistant severe depression for a willingness to pay of €30,000 per QALY.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of life and sexual function of cervical 
cancer patients following radical hysterectomy (RH) and vaginal extension.
METHODS: Case-control and questionnaire- based method was employed in this 
study. Thirty-one patients of early-stage (I b1-I b2) cervical cancer who had 
undergone vaginal extension following classic RH in Peking Union Medical College 
Hospital from December 2008 to September 2012 were included in study group, 
while 28 patients with matching factors and RH only during the same period were 
allocated to control group. There was no significant difference between two 
groups in terms of clinical and demographic variables including age at 
diagnosis, tumor stage and follow-up time (P > 0.05). Patients were assessed 
retrospectively by validated self-reported questionnaires the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cervix Cancer Module 
Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CX24) mainly for quality of life and sexual function 
for cervical cancer patients; the Sexual Function and Vaginal Changes 
Questionnaire (SVQ) further investigates sexual function and vaginal changes of 
patients with gynecologic malignancy at least 6 months after treatment.
RESULTS: Vaginal length acquired by pelvic examination by gynecologic 
oncologists during follow-up visits was (10.0 ± 1.3) cm and (5.9 ± 1.0)cm in 
study group and control group respectively (P = 0.000). Sixty-eight percent 
(21/31) of cases in study group and 64% (18/28) of cases in control group had 
resumed sexual activity at the time of interview, and the time interval between 
treatment and regular sexual activity was mean 6 months (range 3-20 months) and 
mean 5 months (range 1-12 months) in study and control group respectively, in 
which there was not statistical significance (P > 0.05). No difference was 
observed regarding pelvic floor symptoms (P > 0.05) while difficulty emptying 
bladder, incomplete emptying and constipation were most commonly reported. Both 
group presented with hypoactive sexual desire disorder [88% (52/59)], orgasm 
dysfunction [72% (28/39)] and low enjoyment or relaxation after sex [51% 
(20/39)], which was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Reduced vagina 
size and shorter vagina was more prominent in control group (12/18) than that in 
study group [19% (4/21)] with statistical significance (P < 0.05), while no 
difference in sexual desire, vaginal lubrication, dyspareunia and sexual 
enjoyment (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with peritoneovaginoplasty following RH had much longer 
vagina and less self-perceived short vagina. Vaginal extension following RH does 
not worsen the pelvic floor symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is an uncommon type of acute 
leukemia characterized by high early mortality. Current first-line treatments 
include all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), anthracyclines, and other conventional 
chemotherapies (CTs). Although APL is generally associated with a good 
prognosis, about 20% of patients who achieve remission subsequently relapse and 
are resistant to the previously administrated treatment. The objective of this 
study was to assess, from a Canadian perspective, the economic impact of arsenic 
trioxide (ATO) compared to ATRA+CT for treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory APL.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of ATO compared to ATRA+CT for treating patients 
with relapsed/refractory APL was assessed over a lifetime horizon using a Markov 
model. The model considers five health states: induction, second remission, 
treatment failure or relapse, postfailure, and death. Markov cycle length was 1 
month for the first 24 months and 1 yr thereafter. The model also takes into 
account the incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events reported in clinical trials. 
Analyses were conducted from a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and a societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: Compared to ATRA+CT, ATO was associated with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $ 20,551/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from a 
MoH perspective and $ 22,219/QALY from a societal perspective. Results of the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that ATO is a cost-effective 
strategy in 99.27% and 98.98% of the simulations from a MoH and a societal 
perspective, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation demonstrates that ATO is a cost-effective 
strategy compared to ATRA+CT for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory 
APL in Canada.

INTRODUCTION: The life expectancy increased significantly during last four 
decades and is associated with an increasing quality of life. The purpose of 
this study was to determine morbidity and mortality of degenerative lumbar spine 
surgery in patients 80 years of age or older.
METHODS: A consecutive retrospective review evaluated 121 consecutive patients, 
who had undergone posterior decompression associated or not with lumbar 
instrumentation. The average age at the time of surgery was 83.2 ± 2.4 years. 
The study analyzed the comorbidities, the operative procedure and postoperative 
morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: Blood loss increased significantly with instrumentation (538 vs. 280 
mL, p < 0.0001). The average operative time was 103 ± 38 min and increased 
significantly with instrumentation (131.2 vs. 84 min, p = 0.003), blood loss (p 
< 0.0001) and dural tears (p = 0.05). Dural tears occurred in 19 patients 
(15.7%) and were associated significantly with previous lumbar surgery (33.3 vs. 
12.4%, p = 0.017) and major complications (30 vs. 9.9%, p = 0.01). Major 
complications occurred in 16 patients (13%). Minor complications occurred in 36 
patients (29.7%). The delirium was associated with instrumentation (22 vs. 7%, p 
= 0.017) and blood loss (520 vs. 348 mL, p = 0.034). The average hospital stay 
was 11.3 ± 8.1 days. No patients died after a postoperative period of 1 year. 
The average follow-up was 24.3 ± 16.5 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity of degenerative lumbar spine surgery in patients 80 
years of age or older was high. Blood loss, operative time, instrumentation, 
previous surgery and dural tears increased significantly the morbidity. This 
surgery must be decided very carefully and requires to inform the patient and 
his family of the high rate of complications.
