BACKGROUND: Professional pressure is one of the most concerned issues in 
society. Teachers are a group of people with greater professional pressure. The 
pressure sources include students, schools and society.
OBJECTIVE: This exploration aims to explore the professional pressure and mental 
health of college teachers.
METHOD: Based on the expectancy theory, the professional pressure and mental 
health of different college teachers are investigated. The overall steps are as 
follows: the determination of topic, questionnaire design, questionnaire 
distribution and recovery, questionnaire data analysis to obtain results, as 
well as countermeasure analysis based on the results.
RESULTS: The investigation suggests that the sores of college teachers' work 
pressure load, family life pressure, interpersonal pressure, physical and mental 
pressure, leadership and organizational factors pressure, career development 
pressure, scientific research, and professional title pressure are high. From 
senior to elementary, the pressure of teachers increases first and then 
decreases. The professional development pressure of liberal arts teachers is 
significantly higher than that of science teachers and engineering teachers 
(P < 0.05). Among science and engineering teachers, the professional development 
pressure of science teachers is relatively high. Men have better mental health 
than women (P < 0.05). Unmarried teachers have the best mental health status, 
followed by married and finally divorced (P < 0.05). The mental health of senior 
and elementary teachers is significantly better than that of sub-senior teachers 
and intermediate teachers (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The investigation on professional pressure and mental health of 
college teachers can contribute to the related problem solving in China, as well 
as enrich the content of relevant fields in China.

OBJECTIVE: Active treatment of small- or medium-sized vestibular schwannoma 
during wait-and-scan management is currently recommended at most centers 
globally once growth is detected. The primary aim of the current study was to 
characterize the natural history of growing sporadic vestibular schwannoma 
during observation.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Four tertiary referral centers across the United States and Denmark.
PATIENTS: Patients with two prior MRI scans demonstrating ≥2 mm of linear growth 
who continued observational management.
INTERVENTION: Observation with serial imaging.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Subsequent linear growth-free survival (i.e., an 
additional ≥2 mm of growth) following initial growth of ≥2 mm from tumor size at 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among 3,402 patients undergoing observation, 592 met inclusion 
criteria. Median age at initial growth was 66 years (IQR 59-73) for 
intracanalicular tumors (N = 65) and 62 years (IQR 54-70) for tumors with 
cerebellopontine angle extension (N = 527). The median duration of MRI 
surveillance following initial detection of tumor growth was 5.2 years (IQR 
2.4-6.9) for intracanalicular tumors and 1.0 year (IQR 1.0-3.3) for 
cerebellopontine angle tumors. For intracanalicular tumors, subsequent 
growth-free survival rates (95% CI; number still at risk) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
5 years following the initial MRI that demonstrated growth were 77% (67-88; 49), 
53% (42-67; 31), 46% (35-60; 23), 34% (24-49; 17), and 32% (22-47; 13), 
respectively. For cerebellopontine angle tumors, subsequent growth-free survival 
rates were 72% (68-76; 450), 47% (42-52; 258), 32% (28-38; 139), 26% (21-31; 
82), and 22% (18-28; 57), respectively. For every 1 mm increase in magnitude of 
growth from diagnosis to tumor size at detection of initial growth, the HRs 
associated with subsequent growth were 1.64 (95% CI 1.25-2.15; p < 0.001) for 
intracanalicular tumors and 1.08 (95% CI 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02) for 
cerebellopontine angle tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Growth detected during observation does not necessarily portend 
future growth, especially for slowly growing tumors. Because early treatment 
does not confer improved long-term quality of life outcomes, toleration of some 
growth during observation is justifiable in appropriately selected cases.

BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation of platelets (PLTs) could allow extension of their 
shelf-life to years, compared to days for liquid stored platelets. Due to their 
greater hemostatic effect, reconstituted cryopreserved platelets (cryo-PLTs) 
would be able to support bleeding emergencies. Since protein synthesis has been 
linked to PLT functions, such as clot formation and immune responses, the 
translational capacity of reconstituted cryo-PLTs was assessed upon thawing and 
short-term storage.
METHODS/MATERIALS: Platelets were frozen at -80°C with 5-6% DMSO. Upon thawing, 
they were reconstituted in plasma and then aliquoted (12 ml) into mini-bags and 
assessed over 24 h of storage at RT. One series served as control; the second 
and third series were spiked with either 300 μM puromycin (Pm) or 227 nM 
biotin-labeled Pm. Samples were tested for in vitro quality and PLT microvesicle 
enumeration by flow cytometry. Protein synthesis in cryo-PLTs was assessed using 
a modified method based on puromycin-associated nascent chain proteomics.
RESULTS: In vitro parameters of reconstituted and subsequently stored platelets 
were consistent with previously published results. Mass-spectrometry analyses 
identified that 22 proteins were synthesized in PLTs and 13 of those were 
observed in platelet microvesicles (PMVs).
CONCLUSION: Cryo-PLTs can synthesize proteins upon reconstitution and storage. 
Discovery of a subset of these proteins in the PMV suggests a role in vesicle 
encapsulation, possibly in a selective manner. This observation provides novel 
insights into the capacity for protein synthesis in cryo-PLTs and the potential 
regulation of protein packaging into PMV.

Despite the ability of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to increase the 
life expectancy of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
viral reservoirs persist during life-long treatment. Notably, two cases of 
functional cure for HIV have been reported and are known as the "Berlin Patient" 
and the "London Patient". Both patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation from donors with homozygous CCR5 delta32 mutation for an 
associated hematological malignancy. Therefore, there is growing interest in 
creating an HIV-resistant immune system through the use of gene-modified 
autologous hematopoietic stem cells with non-functional CCR5. Moreover, studies 
in CXCR4-targeted gene therapy for HIV have also shown great promise. Developing 
a cure for HIV infection remains a high priority. In this review, we discuss the 
increasing progress of coreceptor-based hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, 
cART, milder conditioning regimens, and shock and kill strategies that have 
important implications for designing potential strategies aiming to achieve a 
functional cure for the majority of people with HIV.

BACKGROUND: Navigated total knee replacements (TKR) have shown better knee 
function and quality of life. It also reduces revision rates. The aim of our 
study is to evaluate short to mid-term clinico-radiological and functional 
results, survival rate and complications of Gradius knee prosthesis implanted 
using computer navigation.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 120 Gradius knee prosthesis, implanted in 
68 patients (52 bilateral TKR and 16 unilateral TKR) and followed from Jan 2015 
till Jan 2020. Pre-operative & post-operative radiographs, knee society scores 
(KSS), range of motion (ROM), deformity assessment and gait video recordings 
were done for all patients.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 3.8 years (minimum 2-5 years).The mean ROM was 
2° (0-10) extension to 135° (128°-138°) flexion. The KSS pain score improved 
from mean of 38.3 (range 26-44) to 90.4 (mean 88-92). The KSS functional score 
improved from 36.2 (range 28-39) to 92.6 (range 86-94). All patients had 
excellent to good function during successive follow-ups. The coronal alignment 
improved from 8° varus to 0.3° varus. Sagittal alignment was corrected from 8° 
(4°-18°) preoperatively to 2° (0°-8°) postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: At mid-term our series outlines the better functional and 
radiological results of Gradius knee prosthesis using navigation as a tool. We 
recommend a prospective randomized controlled trials comparing navigated versus 
non-navigated for Gradius knee prosthesis with long-term follow-up.

In the formation of coordination interactions between metal ions and amino acids 
in natural metalloproteins, the bound metal ion is critical either for the 
stabilization of the protein structure or as an enzyme co-factor. Though 
extremely small in size, metal ions, when bound to the restricted environment of 
an engineered biological nanopore, result in detectable perturbations during 
single channel recordings. All reported work of this kind was performed with 
engineered α-hemolysin nanopores and the observed events appear to be extremely 
small in amplitude (∼1-3 pA). We speculate that the cylindrical pore restriction 
of α-hemolysin may not be optimal for probing extremely small analytes. 
Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA), a conical shaped nanopore, was 
engineered to interact with Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ and a 
systematically larger event amplitude (up to 10 pA) was observed. The measured 
rate constant suggests that the coordination of a single ion with an amino acid 
follows hard-soft-acid-base theory, which has never been systematically 
validated in the case of a single molecule. By adjusting the measurement pH from 
6.8 to 8.0, the duration of a single ion binding event could be modified with a 
∼46-fold time extension. The phenomena reported suggest MspA to be a superior 
engineering template for probing a variety of extremely small analytes, such as 
monatomic and polyatomic ions, small molecules or chemical intermediates, and 
the principle of hard-soft-acid-base interaction may be instructive in the pore 
design.

Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy is an emerging technique with a wide 
range of imaging applications and unique properties in terms of high spatial 
resolution, surface confinement and favourable signal-to-noise ratio. Despite 
its successful analytical applications, tuning the depth of field (i.e., 
thickness of the ECL-emitting layer) is a crucial issue. Indeed, the control of 
the thickness of this ECL region, which can be considered as an "evanescent" 
reaction layer, limits the development of cell microscopy as well as bioassays. 
Here we report an original strategy based on chemical lens effects to tune the 
ECL-emitting layer in the model [Ru(bpy)3]2+/tri-n-propylamine (TPrA) system. It 
consists of microbeads decorated with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ labels, classically used in 
bioassays, and TPrA as the sacrificial coreactant. In particular we exploit the 
buffer capacity of the solution to modify the rate of the reactions involved in 
the ECL generation. For the first time, a precise control of the ECL light 
distribution is demonstrated by mapping the luminescence reactivity at the level 
of single micrometric bead. The resulting ECL image is the luminescent signature 
of the concentration profiles of diffusing TPrA radicals, which define the ECL 
layer. Therefore, our findings provide insights into the ECL mechanism and open 
new avenues for ECL microscopy and bioassays. Indeed, the reported approach 
based on a chemical lens controls the spatial extension of the "evanescent" 
ECL-emitting layer and is conceptually similar to evanescent wave microscopy. 
Thus, it should allow the exploration and imaging of different heights in 
substrates or in cells.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common brain cancer in adults with 
the lowest life expectancy. The current neuro-oncology practice has incorporated 
genes involved in key molecular events that drive GBM tumorigenesis as 
biomarkers to guide diagnosis and design treatment. This study summarizes 
findings describing the significant heterogeneity of GBM at the transcriptional 
and genomic levels, emphasizing 18 driver genes with clinical relevance. A 
pattern was identified fitting the stem cell model for GBM ontogenesis, with an 
upregulation profile for MGMT and downregulation for ATRX, H3F3A, TP53 and EGFR 
in the mesenchymal subtype. We also detected overexpression of EGFR, NES, VIM 
and TP53 in the classical subtype and of MKi67 and OLIG2 genes in the proneural 
subtype. Furthermore, we found a combination of the four biomarkers EGFR, NES, 
OLIG2 and VIM with a remarkable differential expression pattern which confers 
them a strong potential to determine the GBM molecular subtype. A unique 
distribution of somatic mutations was found for the young and adult population, 
particularly for genes related to DNA repair and chromatin remodelling, 
highlighting ATRX, MGMT and IDH1. Our results also revealed that highly lesioned 
genes undergo differential regulation with particular biological pathways for 
young patients. This multi-omic analysis will help delineate future strategies 
related to the use of these molecular markers for clinical decision-making in 
the medical routine.

BACKGROUND: Due to recent medical advancements, patients suffering from 
metastatic spinal disease have a prolonged life expectancy than several decades 
ago, and some will eventually experience relapses. Data for the retreatment of 
spinal metastasis recurrences occurring at the very same macroscopic spot as the 
initially treated lesion are limited. Previous studies mainly included 
recurrences in the boundary areas as well as other macroscopic parts of the 
initially affected vertebrae. This study exclusively analyzes the efficacy and 
safety of spinal reirradiation for recurrences on the same site utilizing 
single-session robotic radiosurgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients between 2005 and 2020 who received radiotherapy 
for a spinal metastasis suffering from a local recurrence were eligible for 
analysis. Only patients undergoing a single-session reirradiation were included. 
All recurrences must have been occurred in the same location as the initial 
lesion. This was defined as a macroscopic recurrence on computed tomography 
occurring at the same site as the initial spinal metastasis. All other lesions, 
including those in the boundary areas or other parts of the initially affected 
vertebrae, were excluded.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients with fifty-three lesions were retreated for spinal 
metastases. The median dose and number of fractions for the initial radiotherapy 
were 36 Gy and 15, respectively. Eleven patients were initially treated with 
stereotactic body radiotherapy. Retreatment was performed with a median dose of 
18 Gy prescribed to a median isodose of 70%. The local control was 77% after a 
median follow-up of 22.2 months. Patients experiencing a second recurrence 
received a lower dose (p = 0.04), mostly below 18 Gy, and had a worse coverage 
(p = 0.01) than those showing local tumor control. 51% of patients experienced 
an improvement in pain control after treatment delivery. Besides, four vertebral 
compression fractures (7% of patients) but no other adverse events higher than 
grade 2 were observed.
CONCLUSION: Single-session robotic radiosurgery appears to be a safe, 
time-saving, and effective treatment modality for spinal metastasis recurrences 
occurring in the same initial location if a considerable dose and coverage can 
be applied. Treatment results are comparable to reirradiated metastases in the 
boundary areas.

Since the beginning of time people explored and developed new technologies to 
make their activities of daily living less labour intense, more efficient and, 
consequently, more sedentary. In addition, technological advances in medicine 
throughout history have led to a substantial increase in life expectancy. 
However, the combination of increased sedentary behaviour and increased 
life-expectancy resulted in a sharp increase in overweight and obesity related 
chronic conditions and illness. Although people may live longer, they are doing 
so with poorer physical function and a reduced quality of life. In this review 
we explore how technological advances have influenced people's sedentary 
behaviour and, through the lens of the affective-reflective theory (ART), we 
propose a means by which technology could be repurposed to encourage greater 
engagement in physical activity.

Posttranslational Modifications of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor and 
Cardiovascular Aging.

During aging, the cardiovascular system is especially prone to a decline in 
function and to life-expectancy limiting diseases. Cardiovascular aging is 
associated with increased arterial stiffness and vasoconstriction as well as 
left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced diastolic function. Pathological 
changes include endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, fibrosis, hypertrophy, 
inflammation, and changes in micromilieu with increased production of reactive 
oxygen and nitrogen species. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system is an 
important mediator of electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis and a key 
contributor to pathological remodeling processes of the cardiovascular system. 
Its effects are partially conveyed by the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a 
ligand-dependent transcription factor, whose activity increases during aging and 
cardiovascular diseases without correlating changes of its ligand aldosterone. 
There is growing evidence that the MR can be enzymatically and non-enzymatically 
modified and that these modifications contribute to ligand-independent 
modulation of MR activity. Modifications reported so far include 
phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and changes induced by 
nitrosative and oxidative stress. This review focuses on the different 
posttranslational modifications of the MR, their impact on MR function and 
degradation and the possible implications for cardiovascular aging and diseases.

Adequate dietary calcium (Ca) intake is essential for bone accretion, peak bone 
mass (PBM) attainment, bone quality and strength during the mammalian growth 
period. Severe Ca deficiency during growing age results in secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and poor bone quality and strength. However, the 
impact of moderate Ca deficiency during rats early growth period on bone health 
and the reversibility with supplementing calcium later in adult life remains 
unclear. Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (postnatal 28th day, P28) were 
initiated either with a moderate calcium-deficient diet (MCD, 0.25% w/w Ca) or a 
control diet (0.8% w/w Ca, control group) till P70. Thereafter, MCD rats were 
continued either with MCD diet or supplemented with calcium diet (0.8% w/w Ca, 
calcium supplemented group, CaS) till P150. Another group (control rats) were 
fed 0.8% w/w Ca containing diet from P28 till P150. MCD group, as compared to 
the control group, had significantly reduced serum ionized Ca and procollagen 
type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) at P70 while no significant change was 
observed in serum corrected Ca, inorganic phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and 
urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen 1 (CTX-1), Ca, and P. Femoral and 
tibial metaphysis in MCD rats had significantly reduced linear growth, cortical 
and trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD), trabecular microarchitecture (BV/TV%, 
trabecular thickness, separation and number, structural model index and 
connectivity density), cortical thickness, and bone stiffness despite the 
absence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Continued MCD at P70-P150 
results in persistence of compromised bone strength while calcium 
supplementation (CaS group) improved all the parameters related to bone strength 
and microarchitecture. Our results indicate that uncorrected 
moderate/subclinical calcium deficiency in growing rats can result in poor bone 
quality and strength despite the absence of SHPT. This finding could have 
relevance in children with poor calcium intake in childhood and adolescence.

Specific and common mediators of gastrointestinal symptom improvement in 
patients undergoing education/support vs. cognitive behavioral therapy for 
irritable bowel syndrome.

Objective: This study sought to characterize change mechanisms that underlie 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptom improvement in IBS patients undergoing two dosages 
of CBT for IBS as compared to a nondirective education/support (EDU) condition. 
Method: Data were collected in the context of a large clinical trial that 
randomized 436 Rome III-diagnosed IBS patients (Mage = 41, 80 % female) to 
standard, clinic-based CBT (S-CBT), a largely home-based version with minimal 
therapist contact (MC-CBT) or Education/Support that controlled for nonspecific 
effects. Outcome was measured with the IBS-version of the Clinical Global 
Improvement scale that was administered at Week 5 and 2-week posttreatment (Week 
12). Potential mediators (IBS Self-efficacy (IBS-SE), pain catastrophizing, fear 
of GI symptoms, and treatment alliance were assessed at Weeks 3, 5, and 8 during 
treatment with the exception of treatment expectancy that was measured at the 
end of Session 1. Results: IBS-SE, a positive treatment expectancy for symptom 
improvement, and patient-therapist agreement on tasks for achieving goals 
mediated effects of CBT early in treatment (rapid response, RR) and at 
posttreatment. Notwithstanding their different intensities, both CBT conditions 
had comparable RR rates (43%-45%) and significantly greater than the EDU RR rate 
of 22%. While pain catastrophizing, fear of GI symptoms, and patient-therapist 
emotional bonding related to posttreatment symptom improvement, none of these 
hypothesized mediators explained differences between CBT and EDU, thereby 
lacking the mechanistic specificity of IBS-SE, task agreement, and treatment 
expectancy. Conclusion: Findings suggest that CBT-induced GI symptom improvement 
may be mediated by a constellation of CBT-specific (IBS-SE) and nonspecific 
(task agreement, treatment expectancy) processes that reciprocally influence 
each other in complex ways to catalyze, improve, and sustain IBS symptom relief.

Parkinson's disease (PD) provokes bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and 
postural instability, and also non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, 
sleep and cognitive impairments. Similar phenotypes can be induced in Drosophila 
melanogaster through modification of PD-relevant genes or the administration of 
PD-inducing toxins. Recent studies correlated deregulation of human 
p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) with PD, leaving open the question of a causative 
relationship of mutations in this gene for manifestation of PD symptoms. To 
determine whether flies lacking the PAK4 homolog Mushroom bodies tiny (Mbt) show 
PD-like phenotypes, we tested for a variety of PD criteria. Here, we demonstrate 
that mbt mutant flies show PD-like phenotypes including age-dependent movement 
deficits, reduced life expectancy and fragmented sleep. They also react to a 
stressful situation with higher immobility, indicating an influence of Mbt on 
emotional behavior. Loss of Mbt function has a negative effect on the number of 
dopaminergic protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) neurons, most likely caused by 
a proliferation defect of neural progenitors. The age-dependent movement 
deficits are not accompanied by a corresponding further loss of PAM neurons. 
Previous studies highlighted the importance of a small PAM subgroup for 
age-dependent PD motor impairments. We show that impaired motor skills are 
caused by a lack of Mbt in this PAM subgroup. In addition, a broader 
re-expression of Mbt in PAM neurons improves life expectancy. Conversely, 
selective Mbt knockout in the same cells shortens lifespan. We conclude that 
mutations in Mbt/PAK4 can play a causative role in the development of PD 
phenotypes.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: For patients undergoing evaluation and treatment of cancers, 
symptom management is a critical component of their treatment plan. For some 
patients, symptoms may become intractable or refractory to common therapies. 
Here, we review treatment options for these severe symptom conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Medication options and regimens have improved to treat 
refractory symptoms. Medications can be tailored to treat chemotherapy-induced 
nausea and vomiting based on current guidelines. Interventions such as venting 
gastrostomy can mitigate symptoms associated with malignant bowel obstruction, 
when life expectancy is long enough to realize this benefit. Opiates can reduce 
refractory dyspnea, consistent with guidelines from the American Thoracic 
Society. Interventional therapies for intractable pain, such as neurolytic 
blocks and intrathecal pumps, have shown promise in managing symptoms when 
traditional therapies have been ineffective. Refractory symptoms can be managed 
in cancer care. The use of multimodal therapies delivered by interdisciplinary 
teams appears to be the most effective way to approach these clinical 
situations.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The risks of developing cancer and dementia both increase 
with age, giving rise to the complex question of whether continued cancer 
screening for older dementia patients is appropriate. This paper offers a 
practice-based clinical approach to determine an answer to this challenging 
question.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is no consensus on the prevalence of cancer and dementia 
as co-diagnoses. Persons with dementia are screened less often compared to those 
without dementia. There is significant literature focusing on screening in the 
geriatric population, but there is little evidence to support decision-making 
for screening for older patients with dementia. Given this lack of evidence, 
individualized decisions should be made in collaboration with patients and 
family caregivers. Four considerations to help guide this process include 
prognosis, behavioral constraints, cognitive capacity, and goals for care. 
Future research will be challenging due to variability of factors that inform 
screening decisions and the vulnerable nature of this patient population.

With the aging of the population and improvement of life expectancy of patients 
with heart disease, there is an increase in non-cardiovascular (CV) 
comorbidities affecting chronic heart failure (HF) patients. The increased 
prevalence of different CV and non-CV comorbidities is a rising problem in the 
management of patients with HF, mostly because these comorbidities may lead to 
poor prognosis, increase of hospitalizations and mortality rate. Recently, 
important data from multicenter randomized studies point to diabetes mellitus or 
iron deficiency as new pharmacological targets, and this highlights the need of 
broad expertise for the 21st-century cardiologist. The management of HF should 
take into account non-CV comorbidities. In this review, we discuss novel aspects 
of non-CV comorbidities in HF patients and emphasize the impact on prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation in the Heart Failure Patients (TELEREH-HF) study 
showed a statistically significant improvement in the tertiary outcomes i.e. the 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class after a 9-week follow-up, consistent 
with telerehabilitation-related benefits to quality of life (QoL) measured with 
the 36-item Short Form questionnaire (SF-36).
AIMS: The study analyzed the cost-effectiveness of hybrid telerehabilitation 
compared to standard care in heart failure patients in the Polish setting using 
findings from the TELEREH-HF trial.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of a public 
payer (the Polish National Health Fund). The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
measure was based on QoL, as survival benefit was not confirmed in the 
TELEREH-HF. Utility values were estimated based on NYHA improvement and a 
systematic review of NYHA-specific utility values. Alternatively, SF-36 results 
were translated into utility values. Telerehabilitation costs covered 8 weeks, 5 
days/week, at a daily cost of 74 Polish zloty (PLN). Standard care costs 
resulted from extra in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation costs incurred for 
selected patients. A lifetime horizon was adopted, with an estimated average 
survival time of 3.9 years based on 2 years TELEREH-HF follow-up and subsequent 
literature-derived prognosis.
RESULTS: Base case analysis yielded a 0.044 and 0.027 gain in QALY for the NYHA 
and SF-36-based approaches, corresponding to a cost per QALY of 58.7 and 96 
thousand PLN, respectively. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the cost per 
QALY value was likely below the official cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of telerehabilitation was found cost-effective in Poland, 
i.e., the clinical benefits justify the additional costs.

BACKGROUND: Conventional external beam radiotherapy is the standard palliative 
treatment for spinal metastases; however, complete response rates for pain are 
as low as 10-20%. Stereotactic body radiotherapy delivers high-dose, ablative 
radiotherapy. We aimed to compare complete response rates for pain after 
stereotactic body radiotherapy or conventional external beam radiotherapy in 
patients with painful spinal metastasis.
METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial 
was done at 13 hospitals in Canada and five hospitals in Australia. Patients 
were eligible if they were aged 18 years and older, and had painful (defined as 
≥2 points with the Brief Pain Inventory) MRI-confirmed spinal metastasis, no 
more than three consecutive vertebral segments to be included in the treatment 
volume, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, a 
Spinal Instability Neoplasia Score of less than 12, and no neurologically 
symptomatic spinal cord or cauda equina compression. Patients were randomly 
assigned (1:1) with a web-based, computer-generated allocation sequence to 
receive either stereotactic body radiotherapy at a dose of 24 Gy in two daily 
fractions or conventional external beam radiotherapy at a dose of 20 Gy in five 
daily fractions using standard techniques. Treatment assignment was done 
centrally by use of a minimisation method to achieve balance for the 
stratification factors of radiosensitivity, the presence or absence of mass-type 
tumour (extraosseous or epidural disease extension, or both) on imaging, and 
centre. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete 
response for pain at 3 months after radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was 
analysed in the intention-to-treat population and all safety and quality 
assurance analyses were done in the as-treated population (ie, all patients who 
received at least one fraction of radiotherapy). The trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02512965.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 4, 2016, and Sept 27, 2019, 229 patients were enrolled and 
randomly assigned to receive conventional external beam radiotherapy (n=115) or 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (n=114). All 229 patients were included in the 
intention-to-treat analysis. The median follow-up was 6·7 months (IQR 6·3-6·9). 
At 3 months, 40 (35%) of 114 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy 
group, and 16 (14%) of 115 patients in the conventional external beam 
radiotherapy group had a complete response for pain (risk ratio 1·33, 95% CI 
1·14-1·55; p=0·0002). This significant difference was maintained in 
multivariable-adjusted analyses (odds ratio 3·47, 95% CI 1·77-6·80; p=0·0003). 
The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was grade 3 pain (five [4%] of 115 
patients in the conventional external beam radiotherapy group vs five (5%) of 
110 patients in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group). No treatment-related 
deaths were observed.
INTERPRETATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy at a dose of 24 Gy in two daily 
fractions was superior to conventional external beam radiotherapy at a dose of 
20 Gy in five daily fractions in improving the complete response rate for pain. 
These results suggest that use of conformal, image-guided, stereotactically 
dose-escalated radiotherapy is appropriate in the palliative setting for symptom 
control for selected patients with painful spinal metastases, and an increased 
awareness of the need for specialised and multidisciplinary involvement in the 
delivery of end-of-life care is needed.
