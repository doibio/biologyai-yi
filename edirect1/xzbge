exclusion and is of primary importance for clinical practice. The treatment is 
based on the use of immunosuppressors as a rule prescribed in addition to 
steroid therapy. It results in complete remission and normal life expectancy in 
80% of the cases.

OBJECTIVES: To examine differences in a proxy measure of muscle quality across 
the adult life span and explore potential mechanisms of muscle quality change 
through identification of cross-sectional correlates of muscle quality.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.
PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred eighty-six individuals with a mean age of 66.3 
(range 26-96) (N = 786). A sensitivity analysis was conducted in a subset of 
participants matched according to sex, muscle mass, and body size.
MEASUREMENTS: Muscle quality was operationalized as the ratio of knee-extension 
strength (isokinetic dynamometry) to thigh muscle cross-sectional area (computed 
tomography). Differences in muscle strength, muscle area, and muscle quality 
ratio with age were evaluated, and the association between the muscle quality 
ratio and measures reflecting domains of cognitive function, motor control, 
peripheral nerve function, adiposity, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation were 
assessed through multivariate regression analyses.
RESULTS: A linear relationship between age and muscle quality ratio was 
observed, suggesting a gradual decline in muscle quality over the adult life 
course. Associations were observed between muscle quality ratio and measures of 
adiposity, as well as peroneal nerve motor conduction velocity, finger tapping 
speed, and memory performance (P < .01). The association between muscle quality 
ratio and nerve conduction velocity was maintained after adjustment for 
anthropometric measurements (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Muscle quality declines progressively with age over the adult life 
span and is affected by obesity and neurological factors. Studies are needed to 
clarify the mechanisms of these associations and their implications for 
functional outcomes.

Economic evaluation of access to musculoskeletal care: the case of waiting for 
total knee arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: The projected demand for total knee arthroplasty is staggering. At 
its root, the solution involves increasing supply or decreasing demand. Other 
developed nations have used rationing and wait times to distribute this service. 
However, economic impact and cost-effectiveness of waiting for TKA is unknown.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of 
three treatment strategies for end-stage knee osteoarthritis: 1) TKA without 
delay, 2) a waiting period with no non-operative treatment and 3) a 
non-operative treatment bridge during that waiting period in a cohort of 60 
year-old patients. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the 
literature. Costs were estimated from the societal perspective with national 
average Medicare reimbursement. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained. Principal outcome measures were average incremental 
costs, effectiveness, and quality-adjusted life years; and net health benefits.
RESULTS: In the base case, a 2-year wait-time both with and without a 
non-operative treatment bridge resulted in a lower number of average QALYs 
gained (11.57 (no bridge) and 11.95 (bridge) vs. 12.14 (no delay). The average 
cost was $1,660 higher for TKA without delay than wait-time with no bridge, but 
$1,810 less than wait-time with non-operative bridge. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio comparing wait-time with no bridge to TKA without delay 
was $2,901/QALY. When comparing TKA without delay to waiting with non-operative 
bridge, TKA without delay produced greater utility at a lower cost to society.
CONCLUSIONS: TKA without delay is the preferred cost-effective treatment 
strategy when compared to a waiting for TKA without non-operative bridge. TKA 
without delay is cost saving when a non-operative bridge is used during the 
waiting period. As it is unlikely that patients waiting for TKA would not 
receive non-operative treatment, TKA without delay may be an overall cost-saving 
health care delivery strategy. Policies aimed at increasing the supply of TKA 
should be considered as savings exist that could indirectly fund those 
strategies.

Spontaneous atraumatic vertebral artery occlusion due to physiological cervical 
extension: case report.

of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.

Vertebral artery (VA) occlusion is a serious and potentially life-threatening 
occurrence. Bow hunter's syndrome, a mechanical occlusion of the VA due to 
physiological head rotation, has been well described in the medical literature. 
However, mechanical VA compression due to routine flexion or extension of the 
neck has not been previously reported. The authors present the unique case of a 
woman without any history of trauma who had multiple posterior fossa strokes and 
was found to have dynamic occlusion of her right VA visualized via cerebral 
angiogram upon extension of her neck. This occlusion was attributed to 
instability at the occipitocervical junction in a patient with a previously 
unknown congenital fusion of both the occiput to C-1 and C-2 to C-3. An occiput 
to C-3 fusion was performed to stabilize her cervical spine and minimize the 
dynamic vascular compression. A postoperative angiogram showed no evidence of 
restricted flow with flexion or extension of the neck. This case emphasizes the 
importance of considering symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency as a result 
of physiological head movement. The authors also review the literature on VA 
compression resulting from physiological head movement as well as strategies for 
clinical diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Thiopurine-methyl transferase (TPMT) testing prior to the 
prescription of azathioprine in autoimmune diseases is one of the few examples 
of a pharmacogenetic test that has made the transition from research into 
clinical practice. TPMT testing could lead to improved prescribing of 
azathioprine resulting in a reduction in adverse drug reactions as well as an 
improvement in effectiveness. When allocating scarce resources robust evidence 
on cost-effectiveness is required.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a TPMT 
genotyping test to inform azathioprine prescribing in autoimmune diseases. The 
secondary aim of this study was to demonstrate the complexity of undertaking a 
trial-based evaluation of a pharmacogenetic test.
METHODS: A prospective economic evaluation was conducted alongside the TARGET 
(TPMT: Azathioprine Response to Genotype and Enzyme Testing) study, a pragmatic 
controlled trial that randomized (1:1) patients to undergo TPMT genotyping 
before azathioprine (n = 167) or current practice (n = 166). Assuming the UK 
health service perspective and a time horizon of 4 months, resource-use and 
health status data were collected prospectively for all recruited patients.
RESULTS: The mean incremental cost for TPMT genotyping and subsequent care 
pathways compared with current practice for the 4-month follow-up was -£421.06 
(95% confidence interval -£925.15 to £89.75). Mean incremental quality-adjusted 
life-years were close to zero but negative: -0.008 (95% confidence interval 
-0.017 to 0.0002). Assuming a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year, the expected incremental net benefit of introducing the test is 
£256.89 (95% CI -£425.94 to £932.86).
CONCLUSIONS: TPMT genotyping potentially offers a less expensive alternative 
than current practice, but it may also have a small but negative effect on 
health status. These findings are associated with significant uncertainty, and 
the causal effect of TPMT genotyping on changes in health status and health care 
resource use remains uncertain. The results from this study therefore pose a 
difficult challenge to decision makers.

OBJECTIVES: Most economic evaluations of chemotherapies for ovarian cancer 
patients have used hypothetical cohorts or randomized control trials, but 
evidence integrating real-world survival, cost, and utility data is limited.
METHODS: A propensity score-matched cohort of 6856 elderly (≥65 years) ovarian 
cancer patients diagnosed from 1991 to 2005 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results-Medicare data cohort were included. Treatment regimens (i.e., no 
chemotherapy, platinum-based only, platinum plus taxane, and other nonplatinum) 
were identified in the 6 months postdiagnosis. Patients were followed until 
death or end of study (December 2006). Effectiveness was measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total health care costs were measured 
by using a payer's perspective (2009 US dollars). Methodological and statistical 
uncertainties were accounted by including alternative scenarios (for utility 
values) and net monetary benefit approach. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were calculated, and stratified analyses were performed by tumor stages 
and age groups.
RESULTS: On comparing the platinum-based group versus no chemotherapy, we found 
that the ICER was $30,073/QALY and $58,151/QALY for early- and late-stage 
disease, respectively, while other nonplatinum and platinum plus taxane groups 
were dominated (less effective and more costly). Similar results were found 
across alternative scenarios and age groups. For patients 85 years or older, 
platinum plus taxane, however, was not dominated by the platinum-based group, 
with an ICER of $133,892/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Following elderly ovarian cancer patients over a lifetime using 
real-world longitudinal data and adjusting for quality of life, we found that 
treatment with platinum-based regimen was the most cost-effective treatment 
alternative.

OBJECTIVE: Health utility scores quantify health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These scores are calculated by using preference 
weights derived from general population samples. We recruited persons with AD 
and their primary informal caregivers and examined differences in health utility 
scores calculated by using two sets of published preference weights.
METHODS: We recruited participants from nine clinics across Canada and 
administered the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire HRQOL 
instrument. We converted participants' EQ-5D questionnaire responses into two 
sets of health utility scores by using US and Canadian preference weights. We 
assessed agreement between sets by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. 
Bland-Altman plots depicted individual-level differences between sets.
RESULTS: For 216 persons with AD and their caregivers, mean health utility 
scores were higher when calculated with US instead of Canadian preference 
weights (P < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient (95% CI) was 0.79 
(0.05-0.93) in the persons with AD group and 0.83 (0.30-0.94) in the caregiver 
group. Ninety-five percent of the individual differences in utility score fell 
between -0.16 and 0.03 for persons with AD and -0.15 and 0.05 for caregivers. 
Forty-three percent of these differences exceeded a minimum clinically important 
threshold of 0.074.
CONCLUSIONS: In AD studies, researchers should calculate health utility scores 
by using preference weights obtained in the general population of their country 
of interest. Using weights from other countries' populations could bias the 
utilities and adversely affect the results of economic evaluations of AD 
treatments.

OBJECTIVES: Economic evaluations of interventions to prevent and control 
sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis are increasingly 
required to present their outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years using 
preference-based measurements of relevant health states. The objectives of this 
study were to critically evaluate how published cost-effectiveness studies have 
conceptualized and valued health states associated with chlamydia and to examine 
the primary evidence available to inform health state utility values (HSUVs).
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, with searches of six electronic 
databases up to December 2012. Data on study characteristics, methods, and main 
results were extracted by using a standard template.
RESULTS: Nineteen economic evaluations of relevant interventions were included. 
Individual studies considered different health states and assigned different 
values and durations. Eleven studies cited the same source for HSUVs. Only five 
primary studies valued relevant health states. The methods and viewpoints 
adopted varied, and different values for health states were generated.
CONCLUSIONS: Limitations in the information available about HSUVs associated 
with chlamydia and its complications have implications for the robustness of 
economic evaluations in this area. None of the primary studies could be used 
without reservation to inform cost-effectiveness analyses in the United Kingdom. 
Future debate should consider appropriate methods for valuing health states for 
infectious diseases, because recommended approaches may not be suitable. Unless 
we adequately tackle the challenges associated with measuring and valuing 
health-related quality of life for patients with chlamydia and other infectious 
diseases, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions in this area will 
remain problematic.

BACKGROUND AIMS: A phase II clinical trial of an autologous dendritic cell (DC) 
formulation for the management of refractory solid malignant tumors was 
conducted across six sites in India with an objective to study safety and 
efficacy.
METHODS: A total of 51 patients with refractory cancer (either sex) with life 
expectancy ≥3 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score ≤2, available 
tumor tissue and adequate organ and bone marrow function were recruited. 
Monocytes obtained by leukapheresis, differentiated into DCs by cytokines and 
primed with autologous tumor lysate (fresh tissue biopsy or paraffin block). On 
the 8th day, mature DCs were analyzed for expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, 
DC205 and DC209. The treatment regime consisted of six doses (intravenous) over 
14 weeks with 2 post-treatment follow-up visits, 6 weeks apart. Safety was 
assessed at all visits and responses were evaluated on days 58, 100 and 184 or 
at end of the study.
RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were evaluated for safety and efficacy. One 
adverse event classified as possibly related was an episode of rigors or chills 
with mild pyrexia during one infusion. Objective response rate by Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors was 28.9% (11/38) and immune-related 
response criteria was 42.1% (16/38); 90% confidence interval for objective 
response rate was (17.2, 43.3) and (28.5, 56.7) by Response Evaluation Criteria 
In Solid Tumors and immune-related response criteria, respectively. The median 
time to treatment progression was >9 weeks. Median overall survival was 397 
days. An increase in the expression of interferon-γ was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy was safe. The responses, time to treatment progression and 
survival are encouraging for patients with aggressive refractory disease.

AIMS: Advances in medical treatment have resulted in increased life expectancy 
in congenital heart disease. Consequently, the focus of management has shifted 
from reducing mortality to reducing long-term morbidity with the goal of 
improving quality of life. A predictor of quality of life might be N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide, a well-established marker for heart failure. We 
aimed to determine the association between N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic 
peptide and quality of life in patients with congenital heart disease.
METHODS: We collected blood samples from consecutive patients who were initially 
operated between 1968 and 1980 (47.8% women; mean age 40.2±5.4 years). The 
36-item Short-Form Health Survey was completed to assess subjective health 
status as a measure of quality of life. Analysis was performed for the entire 
group and for subgroups defined as simple versus complex congenital heart 
diseases. Median N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was 15.2 pmol/L 
(overall range 1.3-299.3 pmol/L). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide 
levels were associated with the subdomain physical functioning (β=-0.074, 
p=0.031). This association remained significant after adjustment for age and sex 
(β=-0.071, p=0.038) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, left 
ventricular function, and renal function (β=-0.069, p=0.048). In complex 
congenital heart disease, the association between N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide and physical functioning remained significant in 
multivariable analysis (β=-0.076, p=0.046). No associations were found in the 
simple congenital heart disease group or on the other health status subdomains.
CONCLUSION: In adults operated for congenital heart disease, N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide is associated with the subdomain physical, 
primarily in the complex subgroup.

BACKGROUND: A traditional explanation for functional (psychogenic) neurological 
symptoms, including functional movement disorders (FMD), is that psychological 
stressors lead to unconsciously produced physical symptoms. However, 
psychological stressors can be identified in only a proportion of patients. 
Patients commonly reported a physical event at onset of functional symptoms. In 
this study, we aim to systematically describe physical events and surrounding 
circumstances which occur at the onset of FMD and discuss their potential role 
in generation of functional symptoms.
METHODS: We recruited 50 consecutive patients from a specialized functional 
movement disorders clinic. Semi-structured interviews provided a retrospective 
account of the circumstances in the 3 months prior to onset of the FMD. 
Questionnaires to assess mood disturbance and life events were also completed.
RESULTS: Eleven males and 39 females were recruited. Forty (80%) patients 
reported a physical event shortly preceding the onset of the FMD. The FMD 
occurred after an injury in 11 patients and after an infection in 9. 
Neurological disorders (n=8), pain (n=4), drug reactions (n=3), surgery (n=3) 
and vasovagal syncope (n=2) also preceded the onset of the functional motor 
symptom. 38% of patients fulfilled criteria for a panic attack in association 
with the physical event.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, physical events precede the onset of functional 
symptoms in most patients with FMD. Although historically neglected in favour of 
pure psychological explanation, they may play an important role in symptoms 
development by providing initial sensory data, which along with psychological 
factors such as panic, might drive subsequent FMD.

Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus encompasses multiple pathophysiological 
and clinical situations. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a long and 
changing natural history. Personal circumstances and preferences also condition 
the actual effectiveness and safety of drugs used. In recent decades, modern 
drugs have markedly expanded and improved therapeutic options. However, their 
effectiveness remains limited in clinical practice. The main objective of 
decreasing macrovascular complications is not fully proven. Adverse events, 
especially hypoglycemia and weight gain, are still frequent and decrease 
treatment adherence. The constant loss of endogenous islet cell reserve is the 
main determinant of the need for intensified therapies. Current treatments have 
failed to improve long-term beta cell mass/function. It is desirable to move 
forward to obtain new drugs that offer solutions sustainable in the long term. 
These drugs should be able to fit the individual circumstances and preferences 
of patients with diabetes mellitus.

BACKGROUND: There is limited research on rural-urban disparities in U.S. life 
expectancy.
PURPOSE: This study examined trends in rural-urban disparities in life 
expectancy at birth in the U.S. between 1969 and 2009.
METHODS: The 1969-2009 U.S. county-level mortality data linked to a rural-urban 
continuum measure were analyzed. Life expectancies were calculated by age, 
gender, and race for 3-year time periods between 1969 and 2004 and for 2005-2009 
using standard life-table methodology. Differences in life expectancy were 
decomposed by age and cause of death.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. In 
2005-2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of 79.1 
years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years in rural 
areas. When stratified by gender, race, and income, life expectancy ranged from 
67.7 years among poor black men in nonmetropolitan areas to 89.6 among poor 
Asian/Pacific Islander women in metropolitan areas. Rural-urban disparities 
widened over time. In 1969-1971, life expectancy was 0.4 years longer in 
metropolitan than in nonmetropolitan areas (70.9 vs 70.5 years). By 2005-2009, 
the life expectancy difference had increased to 2.0 years (78.8 vs 76.8 years). 
The rural poor and rural blacks currently experience survival probabilities that 
urban rich and urban whites enjoyed 4 decades earlier. Causes of death 
contributing most to the increasing rural-urban disparity and lower life 
expectancy in rural areas include heart disease, unintentional injuries, COPD, 
lung cancer, stroke, suicide, and diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 1969 and 2009, residents in metropolitan areas experienced 
larger gains in life expectancy than those in nonmetropolitan areas, 
contributing to the widening gap.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene 
accounts for an autosomal recessive condition called cystic fibrosis (CF). In 
the Indian subcontinent, CF and its related diseases are under-diagnosed by the 
medical community due to poor knowledge of the disease and its confounding 
diagnosis, and also due to poor medical facilities available for these patients, 
thus causing an increased infant mortality rate with a low life expectancy in 
general. The aim of the study was to document the spectrum and distribution of 
CFTR mutations in controls, asthma and chronic pancreatitis cases of North 
India.
METHODS: A total of 800 subjects including 400 controls, 250 asthma cases and150 
chronic pancreatitis cases were analyzed for 6 mutations (F508del, G542X, G551D, 
R117H, W1282X, and S549N) and IVS8 Tn polymorphism.
RESULTS: Out of 800 subjects, 18% [asthma - 24% (n=250), CP - 29.33% (n=150) 
cases and controls - 9.3% (n=400)] were positive for heterozygous mutation, 0.8% 
of the (n=250) asthmatic cases (n=250) were homozygous for IVS8 T5 polymorphism 
while no subjects were found positive for W1282X mutation. T5 polymorphism was 
more common in asthmatic cases while F508del mutation in chronic pancreatitis 
cases. The carrier frequency of F508del, G542X, G551D, R117H, S549N and T5 was 
0.015, 0.025, 0.02, 0.005, 0.005, and 0.022 respectively. The cumulative carrier 
frequency was 0.093.
CONCLUSION: CFTR mutations were underestimated in Indian population. The present 
study will serve in establishment of genetic screening and prenatal setup for 
Indian population.

Previously, large-scale proteomics was possible only for organisms whose genomes 
were sequenced, meaning the most common model organisms. The use of 
next-generation sequencers is now changing the deal. With "proteogenomics", the 
use of experimental proteomics data to refine genome annotations, a higher 
integration of omics data is gaining ground. By extension, combining genomic and 
proteomic data is becoming routine in many research projects. 
"Proteogenomic"-flavored approaches are currently expanding, enabling the 
molecular studies of non-model organisms at an unprecedented depth. Today draft 
genomes can be obtained using next-generation sequencers in a rather 
straightforward way and at a reasonable cost for any organism. Unfinished genome 
sequences can be used to interpret tandem mass spectrometry proteomics data 
without the need for time-consuming genome annotation, and the use of RNA-seq to 
establish nucleotide sequences that are directly translated into protein 
sequences appears promising. There are, however, certain drawbacks that deserve 
further attention for RNA-seq to become more efficient. Here, we discuss the 
opportunities of working with non-model organisms, the proteomic methods that 
have been used until now, and the dramatic improvements proffered by 
proteogenomics. These put the distinction between model and non-model organisms 
in great danger, at least in terms of proteomics!
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Model organisms have been crucial for in-depth analysis 
of cellular and molecular processes of life. Focusing the efforts of thousands 
of researchers on the Escherichia coli bacterium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana plant, Danio rerio fish and other models for which 
genetic manipulation was possible was certainly worthwhile in terms of 
fundamental and invaluable biological insights. Until recently, proteomics of 
non-model organisms was limited to tedious, homology-based techniques, but today 
draft genomes or RNA-seq data can be straightforwardly obtained using 
next-generation sequencers, allowing the establishment of a draft protein 
database for any organism. Thus, proteogenomics opens new perspectives for 
molecular studies of non-model organisms, although they are still difficult 
experimental organisms. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 
Proteomics of non-model organisms.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced morbidity and increased 
life expectancy of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Consequently, non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining 
malignancies are increasing in frequency, which necessitates the concurrent use 
of antineoplastics and ART. Although drug interactions are a major concern when 
combining these agents, there is currently limited guidance on dose adjustments 
required to maintain safe and efficacious drug exposure.

OBJECTIVE: A total of 131 cases of avian-originated H7N9 infection have been 
confirmed in China mainland from February 2013 to May 2013. We calculated the 
overall burden of H7N9 cases in China as of 31 May 2013 to provide an example of 
comprehensive burden of disease in the 21st century from an acute animal-borne 
emerging infectious disease.
DESIGN: We present an accurate and operable method for estimating the burden of 
H7N9 cases in China. The main drivers of economic loss were identified. Costs 
were broken down into direct (outpatient and inpatient examination and 
treatment) and indirect costs (cost of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
and losses in the poultry industry), which were estimated based on field surveys 
and China statistical year book.
SETTING: Models were applied to estimate the overall burden of H7N9 cases in 
China.
PARTICIPANTS: 131 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases by 31 May 2013.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Burden of H7N9 cases including direct and indirect losses.
RESULTS: The total direct medical cost was ¥16 422 535 (US$2 627 606). The mean 
cost for each patient was ¥10 117 (US$1619) for mild patients, ¥139 323 (US$22 
292) for severe cases without death and ¥205 976 (US$32 956) for severe cases 
with death. The total cost of DALYs was ¥17 356 561 (US$2 777 050). The poultry 
industry losses amounted to ¥7.75 billion (US$1.24 billion) in 10 affected 
provinces and ¥3.68 billion (USD$0.59 billion) in eight non-affected adjacent 
provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: The huge poultry industry losses followed live poultry markets 
closing down and poultry slaughtering in some areas. Though the proportion of 
direct medical losses and DALYs losses in the estimate of H7N9 burden was small, 
the medical costs per case were extremely high (particularly for addressing the 
use of modern medical devices). A cost-effectiveness assessment for the 
intervention should be conducted in a future study.

Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Victoria, Australia bDivision of Rheumatology, 
Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) has a case-based mortality that is 
one of the highest among the rheumatic diseases. This article is an appraisal of 
current knowledge regarding survival, causes of death and risk factors for 
reduced life-expectancy in systemic sclerosis (SSc).
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent systematic reviews of cohorts studies published 
worldwide have revealed a pooled standardized mortality ratio in SSc of 3.5, and 
reiterated the importance of heart-lung involvement as a major cause of death in 
this disease. Indeed, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) of mortality in SSc patients 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) compared with those without is 3.5, 
while the pooled HR for mortality in those with interstitial lung disease is 
2.6. The average life expectancy of patients with SSc is 16-34 years less than 
age-matched and sex-matched population peers. Current research efforts are 
focused on quantifying early as well as late mortality, and modeling for 
predictors of death in SSc, with the ultimate goal of attenuating this risk and 
improving survival, as new therapies emerge.
SUMMARY: Studies have consistently shown a substantially increased mortality in 
SSc, predominantly due to cardio-pulmonary complications. A better understanding 
of risk factors for mortality holds the promise of improving outcomes in this 
devastating multiorgan autoimmune disease.

Immunological Sciences University of Siena, Siena, Italy - romanoclara@unisi.it.

Subcutaenous mycoses are increasingly reported in the literature for various 
reasons. Firstly, life expectancy has increased and even patients with cancer 
and/or immunodepression live longer, making them susceptible to these 
infections. Secondly, diagnostic techniques for mycoses have improved. 
Dermatologists have now begun to suspect subcutaneous mycoses when faced with 
certain clinical pictures and are aware of the need for histopathological 
examination and culture of lesion biopsy material on appropriate culture media. 
This review considers the clinical, histopathological and mycological aspects of 
the most common subcutaneous mycoses and outlines how to treat them. A better 
understanding of these mycoses enables early diagnosis and treatment of 
infections that are sometimes life-threatening.

OBJECTIVES: Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a highly bioavailable small molecule that 
inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, promoting glucose oxidation and 
reversing the glycolytic phenotype in preclinical cancer studies. We designed 
this open-label phase II trial to determine the response rate, safety, and 
tolerability of oral DCA in patients with metastatic breast cancer and advanced 
stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This trial was conducted with DCA 6.25 mg/kg orally twice 
daily in previously treated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or stage IV breast cancer. 
Growth inhibition by DCA was also evaluated in a panel of 54 NSCLC cell lines 
with and without cytotoxic chemotherapeutics (cisplatin and docetaxel) in 
normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under normoxic conditions in vitro, single-agent IC50 
was >2 mM for all evaluated cell lines. Synergy with cisplatin was seen in some 
cell lines under hypoxic conditions. In the clinical trial, after seven patients 
were enrolled, the study was closed based on safety concerns. The only breast 
cancer patient had stable disease after 8 weeks, quickly followed by progression 
in the brain. Two patients withdrew consent within a week of enrollment. Two 
patients had disease progression prior to the first scheduled scans. Within 1 
week of initiating DCA, one patient died suddenly of unknown cause and one 
experienced a fatal pulmonary embolism. We conclude that patients with 
previously treated advanced NSCLC did not benefit from oral DCA. In the absence 
of a larger controlled trial, firm conclusions regarding the association between 
these adverse events and DCA are unclear. Further development of DCA should be 
in patients with longer life expectancy, in whom sustained therapeutic levels 
can be achieved, and potentially in combination with cisplatin.

INTRODUCTION: National cohort and intercohort studies have been set to describe 
the differences of life expectancy (LE) of HIV-infected individuals.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of immune recovery 
(IR) on LE of patients with HIV undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, outcome measure was LE of 
patients with HIV compared with LE of northern Italian population. Group 
categorizations were as follows: patients with no immune recovery (nIR), 
patients with IR, patients who are immune maintained, and pre-highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and post-HAART. Abridged life tables were 
constructed from age-specific mortality rates (per 1000 person years) to 
estimate LE from the age of 20-55 years.
RESULTS: A total of 9671 patients, 71% men, were included. After 2005, we 
assisted to a rapid increase in the overall rate of patients attaining IR in the 
community coupled with a progressive decrease of AIDS death, but not of non-AIDS 
deaths. In a 40-year-old patient, LE was 38.10 years [standard error (SE) = 
2.60], 30.08 years (SE = 0.98), and 22.9 (SE = 0.69) in the IR, post-HAART group 
and nIR, respectively, compared with 41.38 years of the general Italian 
population. An approximately 5-year gap in LE was observed in IR patients.
DISCUSSION: We describe IR at a "community" level, related to calendar year and 
apparent 10 years after HAART introduction. HAART community IR is significantly 
influencing LE and is associated with the changing clinical picture of HIV 
disease. An increasing gradient of LE exists between nIR, post-HAART, and IR 
groups, with the latter, above the age of 40 years only, reaching LE of general 
population.

Modelling the cost effectiveness of rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
in first-line therapy and following relapse.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of adding rituximab to fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide (R-FC) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
has been demonstrated in two randomised trials: CLL-8 was conducted in 
previously untreated patients, and REACH was conducted in previously treated 
patients. In both trials, progression-free survival was increased in the R-FC 
treatment groups compared with the FC treatment groups. In CLL-8, overall 
survival was also significantly increased.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness, from 
the Australian healthcare perspective, of rituximab when used as a treatment for 
both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL.
METHODS: A Markov model with three health states (unprogressed, progressed and 
death) was developed to extrapolate the trial results over a 15-year time 
horizon. A treatment algorithm was developed with Australian haematologists to 
inform the treatments to be modelled. The base-case compares up to three courses 
of six cycles of R-FC ('first-line' treatment) followed by three courses of 
post-progression salvage ('Salvage') treatment (including rituximab) with three 
courses of FC followed by three courses of Salvage treatment (excluding 
rituximab). Subsequent treatments are incorporated into the model by repeating 
the unprogressed and progressed health states for each treatment. Time-dependent 
transition probabilities for the model were estimated from an analysis of 
individual patient data from CLL-8 and REACH. Comparisons of the hazard rates 
for the CLL-8 and REACH trials enabled an assessment of the impact on the 
transitions of receiving the same regimen as the first or second treatment, and 
hence inform assumptions regarding transitions for third and subsequent 
treatments. Costs applied in the model were based on published Australian prices 
in 2009.
RESULTS: The model predicts patients receive an average of approximately two 
courses of treatment, and the addition of rituximab results in an incremental 
gain of 0.94 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost 
associated with the addition of rituximab is A$40,268, and hence the cost per 
QALY gained (QALYG) is A$42,906.
CONCLUSION: Rituximab, in combination with chemotherapy, when used multiple 
times throughout the treatment algorithm, appears to be cost effective for CLL 
from the Australian healthcare perspective, with a cost/QALYG within the range 
generally accepted as providing value.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a relatively common and often lethal disease of 
connective tissue. Medical, surgical and basic research advances over the last 
two decades have had a major positive impact on the clinical management of MFS 
patients. Life expectancy has increased significantly, more discriminating 
diagnostic criteria have been developed, a number of new clinical entities have
