Pegunigalsidase alfa, a novel PEGylated, covalently crosslinked form of 
α-galactosidase A developed as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Fabry 
disease (FD), was designed to increase plasma half-life and reduce 
immunogenicity, thereby enhancing efficacy compared with available products. 
Symptomatic adults with FD participated in this open-label, 3-month dose-ranging 
study, followed by a 9-month extension. Three cohorts were enrolled in a 
stepwise manner, each receiving increased doses of pegunigalsidase alfa: 0.2, 
1.0, 2.0 mg/kg, via intravenous infusion every other week. Pharmacokinetic 
analysis occurred on Day 1 and Months 3, 6, and 12. Kidney biopsies at baseline 
and Month 6 assessed peritubular capillary globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) content. 
Renal function, cardiac parameters, and other clinical endpoints were assessed 
throughout. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and presence of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were assessed. Sixteen 
patients completed 1 year's treatment. Mean terminal plasma half-life (each 
cohort) ranged from 53 to 121 hours. All 11 male and 1 of 7 female patients 
presented with classic FD phenotype, in whom renal peritubular capillary Gb3 
inclusions were reduced by 84%. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 
111 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, remaining stable throughout treatment. Three 
patients developed treatment-induced IgG ADAs; following 1 year's treatment, all 
became ADA-negative. Nearly all treatment-emergent AEs were mild or moderate. 
One patient withdrew from the study following a serious related AE. 
Pegunigalsidase alfa may represent an advance in ERT for FD, based on its unique 
pharmacokinetics and apparent low immunogenicity.

Imbalance is a major health problem affecting 90 million Americans and is the 
primary risk factor in falls, which consume $50 billion annually in medical 
costs (US). A person is often unaware of their balance challenge and its 
potential impact on fall risk and subsequent injury. Even when balance deficits 
and fall risk are realized, older patients may not pursue intervention for their 
disorder due to a fatalistic view of their advanced age. In this retrospective 
study, a cohort of older patients who had completed a course of vestibular 
rehabilitation therapy was studied for extent of recovery using computerized 
dynamic posturography (CDP) as the outcomes measure. The study group was 
comprised of sequential outpatients from a community-based balance treatment 
facility for whom pre- and posttherapy CDPs were available for analyses (N = 
76). Patients had been referred for imbalance, vertigo, unsteadiness, and 
falls-age range 66 to 99 years (mean 80.5 years). Balance function, measured by 
composite sensory organization test (SOT) CDP scores, improved on average 35% ( 
P < .0001). Average posttherapy SOT score was 72.8, equivalent to the oldest SOT 
normative scores available (70 to 79 year age bracket; SOT Norm = 72.9). A 
subset 10 years above this eldest norm, mean age 89.4 years (N = 25, range 85 to 
99 years), was then analyzed. Results revealed an improvement in balance 
function of 42.1% ( P < .0001), with average posttherapy SOT score of 74.2. Data 
confirm that vestibular therapy programs can significantly recover, if not 
normalize imbalance even to age 99. Given that the eldest participants were well 
above average life expectancy in the United States (78.9 years), this study 
could be used by allied health professionals to encourage older patients to 
engage in balance and falls prevention programs.

PURPOSE: Silicate-substituted calcium phosphate-enhanced porosity (SiCaP EP, 
Inductigraft™, Altapore) is a synthetic bone graft material with enhanced strut 
porosity of 31-47%. SiCaP EP remains to be fully clinically evaluated in 
patients undergoing instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) surgery. We 
conducted a prospective, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre clinical study 
to evaluate efficacy of SiCaP EP as bone grafting material in PLF surgery with 
instrumentation for treatment of spinal disorders.
METHODS: Patients with degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis or spinal 
stenosis underwent PLF surgery with SiCaP EP. The primary endpoint was evaluated 
in the per protocol population (N = 102) as solid fusion at postoperative month 
12 assessed using computed tomography scans, with motion assessed using 
flexion-extension radiographs. Clinical outcomes included the Oswestry 
Disability Index, 36-item short-form health survey for quality-of-life, visual 
analog scale for pain scores and neurological assessments. Adverse events were 
recorded.
RESULTS: Successful fusion was achieved in 59/89 (66.3%) patients at month 6, 
88/102 patients (86.3%) at month 12 (primary endpoint) and 87/96 (90.6%) 
patients at month 24. Disability and pain reduced following surgery. 
Quality-of-life improved and neurological function was maintained 
postoperatively. Forty-three (33.3%) of the 129 patients who underwent surgery 
experienced adverse events; back pain was most frequent (n = 10); nine and 14 
patients experienced serious adverse events judged related to device and 
procedure, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced strut porosity SiCaP EP provided high (month 12: 86.3%) 
spinal fusion success rates in PLF surgery. Fusion success was associated with 
improved clinical outcomes in patients within 12 months, relative to baseline.

BACKGROUND: The long-term outcomes of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer have 
varied in previous studies. Our nationwide cohort analysis estimated expected 
years of life lost to adjust for lead time bias.
AIM: We recalculated the long-term outcomes for post-colonoscopy and detected 
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer registered in the Taiwan Cancer 
Registry between 2002 and 2009 were enrolled. The detected group included 22,169 
cases of colorectal cancer confirmed within 6 months after a colonoscopy. The 
post-colonoscopy group included 1653 cancer patients who received a colonoscopy 
6-60 months before diagnosis. Patients were followed up until 2011. We simulated 
age-, sex-, and calendar year-matched referents from life tables in the Taiwan 
National Vital Statistics using a Monte Carlo method. The life expectancy and 
expected years of life lost of the cancer patients were obtained from 
extrapolation of the logit transformation of the survival ratio between the 
cancer cohorts and the referent groups.
RESULTS: Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer had shorter life expectancies than 
detected cancer (stages 2-4: 13.6 vs. 16.1 years; 8.7 vs. 12.6 years; 2.1 vs. 
4.1 years, p < 0.001). The loss-of-life expectancy did not show this trend after 
adjusting for lead time bias. Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer was found at an 
older age, more often proximal, and was associated with previous endoscopic 
polypectomy procedures (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer leads to a shorter life 
expectancy, which appears partially explained by the presence of lead time bias. 
Quality assurance for colonoscopy and close surveillance for high risk groups 
would reduce post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness in Canada of atezolizumab compared with 
docetaxel or nivolumab for the treatment of advanced NSCLC after first-line 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Materials and methods: A three-state 
partitioned-survival model was developed. Clinical inputs were obtained from the 
phase III OAK trial comparing atezolizumab with docetaxel in patients with 
advanced NSCLC who progressed after first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy. 
Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were extrapolated 
beyond the trial period using parametric models. A cure model assuming a 1% cure 
fraction was fitted to the OS data for atezolizumab. Outcomes for nivolumab were 
informed by a network meta-analysis (NMA) vs atezolizumab. Resource use and 
costs were informed by clinical expert opinion and published Canadian sources. 
Utility values were obtained from the OAK trial. The perspective of the analysis 
was that of the Canadian publicly-funded healthcare system. The base case time 
horizon was 10 years, and the discount rate was 1.5% annually for both costs and 
effects. Scenario analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results 
and all analyses were performed probabilistically. Results: Atezolizumab 
demonstrated a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of 0.60 compared with 
docetaxel at an incremental cost of $85,073, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $142,074/QALY. Atezolizumab dominated 
nivolumab (regardless of dosing regimen), based on modest differences in both 
QALYs and costs. Docetaxel was most likely to be cost effective at 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds below $125,000/QALY gained, while 
atezolizumab was most likely to be cost effective beyond this WTP threshold. In 
most scenario analyses, the results remained robust to changes in parameters. A 
reduced time horizon and alternative approaches to the NMA had the greatest 
impact on cost-effectiveness results. Conclusion: Atezolizumab represents a 
cost-effective therapeutic option in Canada for the treatment of patients with 
advanced NSCLC who progress after first-line platinum doublet chemotherapy.

Firstly used in the early 90s to generate 3-dimensional projections of X-ray 
images, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has resulted in a large application 
in dentomaxillofacial imaging, even in children. CBCT uses ionizing radiation 
that may cause damage to the DNA, and children are at the greatest 
carcinogenesis risk due to their higher tissue radiosensitivity and their longer 
life expectancy compared to adults. The questions of whether the cancer risk is 
really increased after repeated dental CBCT in childhood and of what the 
underlying biological basis is have become hot topics in the field of dentistry 
and radiobiology. We performed an overview of the current literature to assess 
an acceptable role of CBCT in pediatric dentistry.

BACKGROUND: DOPPS reported that thousands of life-years could be gained in the 
US and Europe over 5 years by correcting six modifiable haemodialysis practices. 
We estimated potential life-years gained across 10 European countries using 
MONITOR-CKD5 study data.
METHODS: The DOPPS-based target ranges were used, except for haemoglobin due to 
label changes, as well as DOPPS-derived relative mortality risks. Percentages of 
MONITOR-CKD5 patients outside targets were calculated. Consistent with the 
DOPPS-based analyses, we extrapolated life-years gained for the MONITOR-CKD5 
population over 5 years if all patients were within targets.
RESULTS: Bringing the 10 MONITOR-CKD5 countries' dialysis populations into 
compliance on the six practices results in a 5-year gain of 97,428 
patient-years. In descending order, survival impact was the highest for albumin 
levels, followed by phosphate levels, vascular access, haemoglobin, dialysis 
adequacy, and interdialytic weight gain.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal management of the six modifiable haemodialysis practices 
may achieve 6.2% increase in 5-year survival.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is highly prevalent in American 
Samoa. Community health worker (CHW) interventions may improve T2DM care and be 
cost-effective. Current cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of CHW interventions 
have either overlooked important cost considerations or not been based on 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The Diabetes Care in American Samoa (DCAS) 
intervention which occurred in 2009-2010 was a cluster-randomized, culturally 
tailored, home-visiting CHW intervention and improved HbA1c levels.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of the DCAS intervention against 
standard care using a RCT in a low-resource setting.
METHODS: We collected clinical, utilization, and cost data over 2 years and 
modeled quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained based on the RCT glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) improvements. We calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) from the societal perspective over a 2-year time horizon and 
reported all costs in 2012 USD ($).
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-eight American Samoans diagnosed with T2DM were 
cluster randomized into the CHW (n = 104) or standard care control (n = 164) 
arms. The CHW arm had a mean reduction of 0.53% in HbA1c, an increase of $594 in 
cost, and an increase of 0.05 QALYs. The ICER for the CHW arm compared to the 
control arm was $1121 per percentage point HbA1c reduced and $13 191 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a variety of willingness-to-pay thresholds from $39 000 
to $154 353 per QALY gained, this ICER shows that the CHW intervention is highly 
cost-effective. Future studies of the cost-effectiveness of CHW T2DM 
interventions in similar settings should model lifetime costs and QALYs gained 
to better assess long-term cost-effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the helmet law on the 
changes in potential years of life lost (PYLL) due to traffic mortality and to 
examine modification effects of socioeconomic factors on the impacts in Vietnam.
METHODS: We applied an interrupted time series design using the Bayesian 
framework to estimate the impact of the law at the provincial level. Then, we 
used random effects meta-analysis to estimate the impact of the law at the 
country level and to examine the modification effects of socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the impacts varied among the provinces. These 
impacts could be classified by four main groups comprising positive impact, and 
positive impact without sustainability, possible positive impact, negative or 
inconsistent impact. For the country-level impact, the results reveal a 
significantly consistent change in monthly PYLLs at the level of 18 per 100 000 
persons, and the post-trend was stable without significant change. The results 
of meta-regression show that 1 unit increase in the population density 
(persons/km2), migration rate (%) and income (×1000 dong) are non-significantly 
associated with increases of PYLLs at 1.3, 27 and 27 per 100 000 person-months, 
respectively, whereas 1% increase in literacy associated with a decrease of PYLL 
at 44 per 100 000 person-months.
DISCUSSION: Further studies should be warranted to provide a comprehensive 
evaluation of the law implementation, including its acceptability, adoption, 
appropriateness, feasibility, cost-effectiveness and sustainability.

To examine differences in burden of disease among people aged ≥70 years old in 
countries with different developmental levels from 1990 to 2016.   Methods: The 
sociodemographic index (SDI) of global burden of disease (GBD) was used to 
divide 195 countries into five developmental levels: high, high middle, middle, 
low middle and low. The results of the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2016 (GBD 
2016) were extracted to examine disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and the 
health loss from the top 10 diseases and risk factors among the people aged ≥70 
years old in countries with different SDIs.   Results: Between 1990 and 2016, 
the age-standardized DALY rate among people aged ≥70 years old in countries with 
different SDIs all showed a downward trend. Different decreases in DALY rate in 
over-seventy old people were observed across countries with different SDI 
levels: -23.9% in high SDI, -21.3% in high-middle SDI, -23.4% in middle SDI, 
-18.8% in low-middle SDI and -16.3% in low SDI. In 1990, the age-standardized 
DALY rate among people aged ≥70 years old in low and low middle SDI countries 
was 1.67 and 1.49 times of that in high SDI countries; and the gaps rose to 1.83 
and 1.59 times in 2016. The DALY rate of the aged people remained remarkably 
higher in low middle and low SDI countries in 2016, and the gap widened compared 
with that in 1990. The reduction of age-standardized DALY rate was mainly due to 
the decrease of years of life lost (YLL). In 2016, low SDI and low-middle SDI 
countries suffered much higher burden of disease from infectious diseases and 
chronic non-communicable diseases. Analysis of leading causes and risk factors 
of DALY showed significant disparities across different SDI countries; burden of 
disease caused by environmental pollution and adverse health conditions was much 
higher in the low SDI and lower-middle SDI countries than that in the other 
countries.  Conclusion: During 1990-2016, the burden of disease in countries of 
all 5 SDI levels declined. But the reductions in the developing countries were 
less than those in the developed countries, widening health disparities for the 
elderly between low and high SDI countries. International organizations and 
individual governments should take measures to narrow health gaps among old 
adults across countries with different developmental levels.

Publisher: 目的：分析1990—2016年全球不同发展水平国家≥70岁老年人口的疾病负担差异及变化趋势。 方法：采用全球疾病负担(global 
burden of 
disease，GBD)研究中社会人口学指数将全球195个国家分为高、偏高、中等、偏低和低5个发展水平。利用2016年GBD研究课题组估算数据，评价不同发展水平国家间≥70岁人口在伤残调整寿命年(disability-adjusted 
life years，DALY)上的差异及变化趋势，估算DALY排名居前十位的疾病及危险因素造成的健康损失比重。 
结果：1990—2016年间，5类发展水平国家≥70岁人口的标化DALY率总体均呈下降趋势，高、偏高、中等、偏低和低5类发展水平国家DALY/10万人下降幅度分别为23.9%，21.3%，23.4%，18.8%和16.3%。1990年，低和较低发展水平国家≥70岁年龄标化DALY率分别为高发展水平国家的1.67倍和1.49倍，2016年分别为1.83倍和1.59倍，差距扩大。标化DALY率下降主要来自于过早死亡寿命损失年的降低。2016年，低和较低发展水平国家≥70岁人口面临着传染性疾病和慢性非传染性疾病均高发的疾病模式；环境污染和不良卫生条件相关的危险因素在低和较低发展水平国家中造成严重的疾病负担。 
结论：1990—2016年间，尽管5类发展水平国家的疾病负担均有所下降，但发展水平较低国家的下降幅度低于发展水平偏高的国家，加剧了高发展水平国家和低发展水平国家之间的老年人健康差距。国际组织及各国政府应根据当前面临的主要疾病和危险因素采取措施，缩小不同发展水平国家之间老年人的健康差距。.

Family Change and Changing Family Demography.

Increases in life expectancy, high rates of movement into and out of couple 
relationships, and increasing exposure to stepfamilies raise new questions about 
who is in a family, the distinction between who lives together and who is a 
family member, and the extent to which family members are expected to meet the 
long-term obligations that define kinship. These questions are important because 
families have traditionally served as a vital private safety net for family 
members. Demographic changes increase family members' uncertainty about their 
relationships. Family ties are less stable and more uncertain among the 
economically disadvantaged, and uncertainty may exacerbate these disadvantages 
by weakening individuals' ability to rely on family members' support to 
alleviate hardship. I argue that demographers should focus on individuals' 
family relationships to gain insight into living arrangements and family 
dynamics. I also outline the development of family concepts and improvements in 
study design to identify principles that demographers should incorporate in new 
research to shed light on families' support for their members.

Homicide is a leading cause of death for young people in the United States aged 
15-34, but it has a disproportionate impact on one subset of the population: 
African American males. The national decline in homicide mortality that occurred 
from 1991 to 2014 thus provides an opportunity to generate evidence on a unique 
question-How do population health and health inequality change when the 
prevalence of one of the leading causes of death is cut in half? In this 
article, we estimate the impact of the decline in homicide mortality on life 
expectancy at birth as well as years of potential life lost for African American 
and white males and females, respectively. Estimates are generated using 
national mortality data by age, gender, race, and education level. 
Counterfactual estimates are constructed under the assumption of no change in 
mortality due to homicide from 1991 (the year when the national homicide rate 
reached its latest peak) to 2014 (the year when the homicide rate reached its 
trough). We estimate that the decline in homicides led to a 0.80-year increase 
in life expectancy at birth for African American males, and reduced years of 
potential life lost by 1,156 years for every 100,000 African American males. 
Results suggest that the drop in homicide represents a public health 
breakthrough for African American males, accounting for 17 % of the reduction in 
the life expectancy gap between white and African American males.

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the most attractive tools employed 
nowadays by environmental policy-makers as well as business decision-makers to 
ensure environmentally sustainable production/consumption of various 
goods/services. LCA is a systematic, rigorous, and standardized approach aimed 
at quantifying resources consumed/depleted, pollutants released, and the related 
environmental and health impacts through the course of consumption and 
production of goods/service. Algal fuels are no exception and their 
environmental sustainability could be well scrutinized using the LCA 
methodology. In line with that, this chapter is devoted to present guidelines on 
the technical aspects of LCA application in algal fuels while elaborating on 
major standards used, i.e., ISO 14040 and 14044 standards. Overall, LCA 
practitioners as well as technical experts dealing with algal fuels in both the 
public and private sectors could be the main target audience for these 
guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with cancer face difficult decisions regarding treatment and 
the possibility of trading quality of life (QoL) for length of life (LoL). 
Little information is available regarding patients' preferences and attitudes 
toward their cancer treatment and the personal costs they are prepared to 
exchange to extend their life. The aim of this review is to determine the 
complex trade-offs and underpinning factors that make patients with cancer 
choose quality over quantity of life.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using MeSH terms: 
cancer, longevity or LoL, QoL, decision making, trade-off, and health utility. 
Articles retrieved were published between 1942 and October 2018.
RESULTS: Out of 4393 articles, 30 were included in this review. Older age, which 
may be linked to declining physical status, was associated with a preference for 
QoL over LoL. Younger patients were more likely to undergo aggressive treatment 
to increase survival years. Preference for QoL and LoL was not influenced by 
gender, education, religion, having children, marital status, or type of cancer. 
Patients with better health valued LoL and inversely those with poorer physical 
status preferred QoL.
CONCLUSION: Baseline QoL and future expectations of life seem to be key 
determinants of preference for QoL versus LoL in cancer patients. In-depth 
studies are required to understand these trade-offs and the compromises patients 
are willing to make regarding QoL or LoL, especially in older patients with 
naturally limited life expectancy.

Researchers cannot predict as yet how long a human being can live. Life 
expectancy has been steadily increasing in the last century, but perhaps not 
always the quality of life in parallel with it. Future generations will be faced 
with the problems of an increased life expectancy along with the emergence of 
new age-related diseases. A deeper understanding of the aging process is crucial 
to ameliorate, if not to prevent, these projected new old-age diseases. One of 
the mechanisms responsible for healthy aging is through the effective 
maintenance of physiological, biochemical, and immunological functions. To carry 
this out, the organism needs to create new cells to replace old ones and to 
induce the disappearance of old and damaged cells. Apoptosis is involved in all 
these processes. However, if apoptosis is dysregulated, premature 
senescence-associated diseases are likely to appear. In our review, the focus 
will be on a better understanding of the role of apoptosis in the aging process. 
These signaling pathways will most assuredly be pharmacologically targeted in 
antiaging medicine therapies.

The Relationship Between Public Sector Employment and Population Health: 
Evidence From the 1980s and Its Contemporary Implications.

China, Beijing, China.

This article explores the relationship between public sector employment and 
population health both theoretically and quantitatively. First, we build a 
theoretical framework to situate public employment in the literature that 
explores the link between politics and health. We argue that public employment, 
as an instrument of pro-redistributive policies in both the labor market and the 
welfare state, improves equality and ultimately health. Second, based on a 
cross-country dataset from the 1980s, and by applying regression analysis and 
outlier identification techniques, we find that population health measured by 
life expectancy improves with the size of public employment. The association is 
stronger for countries with lower income and for women. When policymakers 
contemplate downsizing state enterprises and government functions, they should 
consider the health effect of public employment.

BACKGROUND: New technologies can promote knowledge of HIV infection among 
patients suffering from this disease. Older patients with HIV infection 
represent an increasingly large group that could benefit from the use of 
specific apps.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to observe the acceptability and use of a 
mobile app on HIV infection in patients at least 60 years old and offer them the 
possibility of anonymously establishing contact with their peers.
METHODS: A series of clinical and psychosocial parameters were studied in 30 
HIV-infected patients of over 60 years. The patients must be at least 60 years 
old, with a follow-up in the outpatient clinic for at least 1 year and without 
pathologies that limit his or her life expectancy to less than a year. They must 
know how to read and write. To be part of the group assigned to the app, they 
had to have their own smartphone and confirm that they were connected to the 
internet from that device. Overall, 15 of them were randomized to use an app and 
15 were in the control group. All tests were repeated after 6 months.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 66.5 years. Among them, 29 patients had 
an undetectable viral load at baseline. The median number of comorbid diseases 
was 2. Overall, 11 of them lived with their partners and 19 lived alone. They 
spent an average of 5 hours a day sitting down, and 56% (17/30) of them referred 
high physical activity. They scored 4 out of 5 for general quality of life 
perception. Moreover, 80% (24/30) presented high adherence to their treatment, 
and the average number of concomitant medications was 5. In the 6-min walking 
test, they covered a distance of 400 meters, and 3 of them desaturated during 
the test. The 15 patients made frequent use of the app, with 2407 sessions and 
an average of 7 min and 56 seconds time of use with a total of 13,143 screen 
views. During the 6 months of the trial, 3 non-AIDS events took place. There 
were no significant modifications to body mass index, blood pressure 
measurements, lipid profile, or immuno-virology information data. There were no 
differences in the questionnaire scores for perception of quality of life, 
confessed physical activity, or antiretroviral treatment (ART) and non-ART 
treatment adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between studied parameters were not 
objectified in these patients, possibly because this trial has significant 
limitations, such as a small sample size and only a brief follow-up period. 
However, patients did use the app frequently, making this a possible 
intervention to be proposed in future subsequent studies.

BACKGROUND: Widely expected cuts to budgets for global HIV/AIDS response force 
hard prioritization choices.
SETTING: We examine policies for antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility 
through the lens of the most relevant ethical approaches.
METHODS: We compare earlier ART eligibility to later ART eligibility in terms of 
saving the most lives, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years, special 
consideration for the sickest, special consideration for those who stand to 
benefit the most, special consideration for recipients' own health needs, and 
special consideration to avoid denying ART permanently.
RESULTS: We argue that, in most low- and middle-income countries with 
generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic, ethically, ART for sicker patients should come 
before ART eligibility for healthier ones immediately on diagnosis (namely, 
before "universal test and treat"). In particular, reserving all ART for sicker 
patients would usually save more life-years, prioritize the sickest, and display 
other properties that some central ethical approaches find important, and that 
concern none-so ethically, it is "cross-theoretically dominant," as we put it.
CONCLUSIONS: In most circumstances of depressed financing in low- and 
middle-income countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic, reserving all ART 
for sicker patients is more ethical than the current international standard.

PURPOSE: To study regional trends in average years of potential life lost 
(AYPLL) among Caucasians (CA) and African Americans (AA) with prostate cancer 
(Pca) who received radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy among four 
different regions in the US as well as across different tumor grades. Years of 
potential life lost is defined as the difference between a predetermined 
end-point age and the age at death for a death that occurred prior to that end 
age, hence the AYPLL is calculated by dividing the total YPLL by the total 
number of patients died.
METHODS: The surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) database was used 
to identify Pca patients who were CA or AA and who have received radical 
prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Study duration was divided into four 
decades; 1973-1982 (D1), 1983-1992 (D2), 1993-2002 (D3), 2003-2012 (D4). 
Examined regions were; North East (NE), North central (NC), South and West. 
Tumor grade was classified into; well/moderately differentiated (WD/MD) and 
poorly/undifferentiated (PD/UD) groups. Differences in AYPLL among CA and AA in 
each of these variables were compared.
RESULTS: Overall, compared to CA, AA were diagnosed and died earlier from Pca. 
AA had higher AYPLL to Pca than CA. In both tumor grade groups, progressive 
increase in AYPLL among AA compared to CA was noted over the last three decades. 
In the WD/MD group, except for the South region, the highest recorded difference 
in AYPLL between AA and CA was in D4. In the PD/UD group, a similar difference 
in AYPLL between AA and CA was noted in all regions. The difference in AYPLL was 
higher in the PD/UD group than the WD/MD group.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparity between AA and CA existed across the examined 
regions. It is more pronounced in advanced tumor grades. The differences were 
more significant in the last decade.

BACKGROUND: Perceptions of high cost and resource intensity remain political 
barriers to the prioritization of childhood cancer treatment programs in many 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Little knowledge exists of the actual 
cost and cost-effectiveness of such programs. To improve outcomes for children 
with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), the most common childhood cancer in Africa, the 
Uganda Cancer Institute implemented a comprehensive BL treatment program in 
2012. We undertook an economic evaluation of the program to ascertain the 
cost-effectiveness of BL therapy in a specific LIC setting.
METHODS: We compared the treatment of BL to usual care in a cohort of 122 
patients treated between 2012 and 2014. Costs included variable, fixed, and 
family costs. Our primary measure of effectiveness was overall survival (OS). 
Patient outcomes were determined through prospective capture and retrospective 
chart abstraction. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted was 
calculated using the World Health Organization's Choosing Interventions That Are 
Cost-Effective (WHO-CHOICE) methodology.
RESULTS: The 2-year OS with treatment was 55% (95% CI, 45% to 64%). The cost per 
DALY averted in the treatment group was US$97 (Int$301). Cumulative estimate of 
national DALYs averted through treatment was 8607 years, and the total national
