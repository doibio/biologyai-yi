BACKGROUND: Knee arthroplasty (KA) is a typically successful surgical procedure 
commonly performed to alleviate painin participants with end-stage knee 
osteoarthritis. Despite its beneficial effects, a significant proportion of 
individuals with KA continue experiencing persistent pain and functional 
limitations. The purpose of this study was to assess the postoperative outcomes 
after KA in relation to postoperative pain catastrophizing.
METHODS: Participants were recruited at a domiciliary physiotherapy service, 
using a prospective, observational, hypothesis-generating cohort design. 
Participants were divided into two groups based on their Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale (PCS) total score (50th percentile), which resulted in high and low PCS 
groups. The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). In addition, quality of life, walking 
speed, physical performance, range of motion, and pain were measured. Outcome 
measures were collected at baseline (1 week postoperatively) and at follow-up 
(1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively).
RESULTS: A total of 60 participants (21 total KA and 39 unicompartmental KA) 
were recruited. Individuals with a higher degree of pain catastrophizing showed 
significantly higher WOMAC total scores at every follow-up, indicating poorer 
health functioning (p < 0.01). Similarly, the high PCS group showed higher WOMAC 
pain, stiffness and disability subscale scores (p < 0.05), poorer quality of 
life (p < 0.01), and poorer physical performance (p < 0.05) at every follow-up. 
In addition, the high PCS group achieved a slower walking speed at baseline and 
at 3 months follow-up (p < 0.05), and a higher degree of pain at rest, on 
walking and on knee flexion at every follow-up (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, 
respectively) except for walking pain at 3 months follow-up. No significant 
differences were observed between groups in range of motion, except for active 
knee extension at the 6-month follow-up (p < 0.05). Effect size was large at 1 
month follow-up in WOMAC total score (r = 0.578) and pain intensity during knee 
flexion (r = 0.529). Longitudinal analyses revealed different improvement trends 
during the rehabilitation process between groups, with a lack of significant 
improvements in the high PCS group between the 3- and 6-month follow-up in WOMAC 
total score, WOMAC pain, WOMAC disability, quality of life, physical 
performance, active knee extension and resting pain (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that participants with high 
postoperative pain catastrophizing might have poorer outcomes during the 
rehabilitation process after KA. Future work should seek to clarify if this 
relationship is causal.

OBJECTIVE: Precise hip cup positioning is essential for the prevention of 
component impingement and dislocation in robotic assisted total hip arthroplasty 
(THA). Currently, the robotic system uses a mechanical alignment guide (MAG) for 
cup placement, which is one-size-fits-all, and the optimal cup positioning is 
controversial. Robotic assisted THA has not used any personalized cup 
positioning guides. The goal of this study was to identify an optimal guide for 
cup placement in robotic assisted THA to improve prognosis and life quality 
after THA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pelvis and femoral CT data of 47 participants were 
retrospectively collected for preoperative planning of robotic THA. The 
universal MAG guide and three personalized guides, including acetabular rim 
labrum guide (ARLG), transverse acetabular ligament guide (TALG), and 
ischiatic-pubis line guide (IPLG), were used to pose cups in the acetabulum of 
each participant. The position of cups was evaluated by inclination and 
anteversion; the function of hip joints was evaluated by hip ranges of motion, 
including abduction, adduction, extension, flexion, internal rotation, and 
external rotation.
RESULTS: In terms of cup positioning, ARLG provided a bigger cup inclination (p 
< 0.0001), while IPLG and TALG provided smaller cup inclination (p < 0.001) than 
MAG; the three personalized guides provided larger cup anteversion (p < 0.0001) 
than MAG. In terms of HROMs, compared with the use of MAG, the use of three 
personalized guides significantly decreased abduction (p < 0.0001), extension (p 
< 0.0001), and external rotation (p < 0.0001), but increased significantly 
flexion (p < 0.0001) and internal rotation (p < 0.0001); the use of ARLG 
significantly reduced adduction (p < 0.0001), but the use of IPLG and TALG 
increased adduction (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Compared with MAG, personalized guides provided greater flexion and 
internal rotation, which may reduce the risk of posterior dislocation. Among the 
three personalized guides, IPLG is the most reliable one for the preoperative 
planning of robotic assisted THA.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2021 update on diagnosis, 
risk-stratification and management.

DISEASE OVERVIEW: Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) respectively characterized by clonal 
erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis; other disease features include leukocytosis, 
splenomegaly, thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus and risk 
of leukemic or fibrotic transformation.
DIAGNOSIS: Bone marrow morphology remains the cornerstone of diagnosis. In 
addition, the presence of JAK2 mutation is expected in PV while approximately 
90% of patients with ET express mutually exclusive JAK2, CALR or MPL mutations 
(so called driver mutations). In ET, it is most important to exclude the 
possibility of prefibrotic myelofibrosis.
SURVIVAL: Median survivals are approximately 15 years for PV and 18 years for 
ET; the corresponding values for patients age 40 or younger were 37 and 
35 years. Certain mutations (mostly spliceosome) and abnormal karyotype might 
compromise survival in PV and ET. Life-expectancy in ET is inferior to the 
control population. Driver mutations have not been shown to affect survival in 
ET but risk of thrombosis is higher in JAK2 mutated cases. Leukemic 
transformation rates at 10 years are estimated at <1% for ET and 3% for PV.
THROMBOSIS RISK: In PV, two risk categories are considered: high (age > 60 years 
or thrombosis history present) and low (absence of both risk factors). In ET, 
four risk categories are considered: very low (age ≤ 60 years, no thrombosis 
history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), 
intermediate (age > 60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type) and high 
(thrombosis history present or age > 60 years with JAK2 mutation).
RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The main goal of therapy in both PV and ET is to prevent 
thrombohemorrhagic complications. All patients with PV require phlebotomy to 
keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily or twice-daily aspirin (81 mg), in the 
absence of contraindications. Very low risk ET might not require therapy while 
aspirin therapy is advised for low risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is 
recommended for high-risk ET and PV, but it is not mandatory for 
intermediate-risk ET. First-line drug of choice for cytoreductive therapy, in 
both ET and PV, is hydroxyurea and second-line drugs of choice are interferon-α 
and busulfan. We do not recommend treatment with ruxolutinib in PV, unless in 
the presence of severe and protracted pruritus or marked splenomegaly that is 
not responding to the aforementioned drugs.
NEW TREATMENT DIRECTIONS: Controlled studies are needed to confirm the clinical 
outcome value of twice-daily vs once-daily aspirin dosing and the therapeutic 
role of pegylated interferons and direct oral anticoagulants.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, opportunities for pharmacists to have 
face-to-face conversations with cancer patients have increased in Japan. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the difficulties experienced by Japanese 
pharmacists when communicating with cancer patients.
METHODS: We interviewed 7 pharmacists at Okayama University Hospital (Japan), 
using the semi-structured interview method. The obtained data were qualitatively 
analysed. A questionnaire was also filled out by 50 Japanese pharmacists to 
determine the difficulties they faced when communicating with cancer patients.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The difficulties experienced by pharmacists when 
communicating with cancer patients were classified into the following three 
domains: (a) coping with patients' negative emotions, (b) questions beyond the 
scope of pharmacists' expertise and (3) how to manage patients and their 
families. Factor analysis indicated that the main difficulties pharmacists 
experienced were coping with patients' negative emotions and questions that were 
beyond the scope of their expertise. However, pharmacists were unlikely to 
experience difficulties in communicating additional information regarding 
anticancer drugs. Hospital pharmacists in Japan had some difficulties in 
communicating with cancer patients. In particular, many pharmacists felt that 
they could not sufficiently manage patients' negative emotions and answer 
questions beyond the scope of their expertise, such as questions about life 
expectancy or prognosis.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that pharmacists 
experienced three types of difficulties when communicating with cancer patients: 
coping with patients' negative emotions, questions beyond the scope of their 
expertise and how to manage patients and their families. These results might 
facilitate the development of interventions that aim to improve 
patient-pharmacist communications in Japan.

OBJECTIVES: Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) plus gemcitabine (AG) and Fluorouracil, 
leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) have shown significant clinical 
benefit and been widely used as 1st-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic 
cancer (mPC) in China. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of AG 
versus FOLFIRINOX regimen for the treatment of mPC patients in China.
METHODS: Markov model was developed with a lifetime survival projection in 
Microsoft Excel® to simulate the progression of the mPC over time. The 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resource consumption in the health care 
sector and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported. 
Uncertainty was assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: AG regimen provided an effectiveness of 1.35 QALY at an average cost of 
USD 22,300 whereas FOLFIRINOX regimen brought 0.82 QALY at a cost of USD 22,980 
in lifetime horizon. Therefore, AG regimen was dominant with an ICER of USD 
-1300 compared with FOLFIRINOX regimen. AG arm generated less drug cost, medical 
cost, hospitalization cost, and end-of-life cost than FOLFIRINOX arm did. 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of base case findings.
CONCLUSIONS: AG is likely a cost-effective option for the 1st-line mPC treatment 
compared with FOLFIRINOX in China from the perspective of healthcare system.

The Zigzag ladybird beetle, Cheilomenes sexmaculata (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: 
Coccinellidae), is a biological control agent that feeds on a variety of aphid 
species. Life table and predation data of C. sexmaculata were collected under 
laboratory conditions at 25±2⁰C, 60±5% RH and L14: D10 h in connection with 
feeding on four different aphid species; Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach), Myzus 
persicae (Sulzer), Aphis nerii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) and Diuraphis noxia 
(Mordvilko). Larval development of C. sexmaculata was long when fed on M. 
persicae (12.18 days) and shorter on D. noxia (10.64 days). The male's lifespan 
was longer on M. persicae (26.70 days) and shorter on L. erysimi (23.67 days). 
Fecundity was maximum when the beetle was fed D. noxia (316.8 eggs/female) and 
minimum on M. persicae (199.1 eggs/female). Net reproductive rate, intrinsic 
rate of increase and finite rate of increase were highest on D. noxia with 
values of 158.4 (offspring individual-1), 0.22 d-1, and 1.24 d-1, respectively 
whereas the respective parameters were lowest on L. erysimi (99.5 offspring 
individual-1, 0.19 d-1, and 1.20 d-1, respectively). However, the mean of the 
generation (T) was shorter on A. nerii (22.48 d-1) and longer on M. persicae 
(24.68 d-1). Based on life table parameters obtained under laboratory 
conditions, the most appropriate host of C. sexmaculata was D. noxia. This study 
should help us to improve mass rearing and use of C. sexmaculata in the 
biological control of aphids on field and horticultural crops.

BACKGROUND: Care-seeking for sick children at the Ethiopian primary health care 
level is low. This problem may partly be due to unfavorable community 
perceptions of the quality of care provided. There is, however, limited 
knowledge on the quality of the clinical assessment and management provided by 
the health extension workers at the health posts. This study aimed to examine 
the quality of clinical assessment, classification and management provided to 
sick under-five children by health extension workers in four regions of 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: Clinical observations of 620 consultations of sick children by health 
extension workers were conducted from December 2016 to February 2017. A clinical 
pathway analysis was performed to analyze whether sick children were 
appropriately assessed, classified and managed according to the integrated 
Community Case Management guidelines.
RESULTS: Most sick children presented with complaints of cough (58%), diarrhea 
(36%), and fever (26%).Three quarters of children with respiratory complaints 
had their respiratory rate counted (74%, 95% CI 69-78), while a third (33%, 95% 
CI 27-40) of children with diarrhea were assessed for dehydration. Half (53%, 
95% CI 49-57) of the sick children were assessed for general danger signs, while 
a majority (89%, 95% CI 86-92) had their arm circumference measured for 
malnutrition. Half of the sick children received some treatment and less than 
one-fifth were referred according to the integrated Community Case management 
guidelines. Comprehensive counseling was provided to 38% (95% CI 35-42) of the 
caregivers.
CONCLUSION: The Ethiopian health extension workers' clinical assessment, 
classification and management of sick children did to a large extent not follow 
the clinical guidelines. This lack of adherence could lead to misdiagnoses and 
lack of potentially life-saving treatments.

York School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.

OBJECTIVES: The Medicare Health Outcome Survey (HOS) is the largest longitudinal 
survey of the U.S. community-dwelling elderly population. This study estimated 
total life expectancy, active life expectancy (ALE), and disability-free life 
expectancy (DFLE) by disability status among HOS participants.
METHODS: Data were from the Medicare HOS Cohort 15 (baseline 2012, follow-up 
2014). We included respondents aged ≥ 65 years (n = 164,597). Participants' 
disability status was assessed based on the following six activities of daily 
living (ADL): bathing, dressing, eating, getting in or out of chairs, walking, 
and using the toilet. The multi-state models were used to estimate life 
expectancy, ALE, and DFLE by participants' baseline disability status and age.
RESULTS: Persons who had higher-level ADL limitations had a shorter life 
expectancy, ALE, and DFLE. Also persons with disability had greater expected 
life years with disability than those with no limitations and those with mild 
limitations. For example, among 65-year old respondents with no limitations, 
mild limitations, and disability, life expectancy was 19.9, 18.6, and 17.1 
years, respectively; ALE was 14.0, 9.5, and 7.2 years, respectively; DFLE was 
17.3, 15.2, and 11.4 years, respectively; and expected years with disability was 
2.6, 3.4, and 5.7 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that greater levels of disability adversely 
impact life expectancy, ALE, DFLE, and expected number of years with a 
disability among U.S. older adults. Understanding levels of disability, and how 
these may change over time, would enhance health care quality and planning 
services related to home care and housing in this community-dwelling population.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: A better understanding of prognostic factors in ulcerative 
colitis (UC) could improve patient management and reduce complications. We aimed 
to identify evidence-based predictors for outcomes in pediatric UC, which may be 
used to optimize treatment algorithms.
METHODS: Potential outcomes worthy of prediction in UC were determined by 
surveying 202 experts in pediatric UC. A systematic review of the literature, 
with selected meta-analysis, was performed to identify studies that investigated 
predictors for these outcomes. Multiple national and international meetings were 
held to reach consensus on evidence-based statements.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 31 statements regarding predictors of 
colectomy, acute severe colitis (ASC), chronically active pediatric UC, cancer 
and mortality. At diagnosis, disease extent (6 studies, N = 627; P = .035), 
Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index score (4 studies, n = 318; P < 
.001), hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin may predict colectomy. In addition, 
family history of UC (2 studies, n = 557; P = .0004), extraintestinal 
manifestations (4 studies, n = 526; P = .048), and disease extension over time 
may predict colectomy, whereas primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) may be 
protective. Acute severe colitis may be predicted by disease severity at onset 
and hypoalbuminemia. Higher Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index score 
and C-reactive protein on days 3 and 5 of hospital admission predict failure of 
intravenous steroids. Risk factors for malignancy included concomitant diagnosis 
of primary sclerosing cholangitis, longstanding colitis (>10 years), male sex, 
and younger age at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These evidence-based consensus statements offer predictions to be 
considered for a personalized medicine approach in treating pediatric UC.

BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the clinical benefit of admission to 
critical care after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).
PURPOSE: We investigated factors associated with critical care admission after 
spontaneous ICH and evaluated associations between critical care and 6-month 
functional outcome.
METHODS: We included 825 patients with acute spontaneous non-traumatic ICH, 
recruited to a prospective multicenter observational study. We evaluated the 
characteristics associated with critical care admission and poor 6-month 
functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3) using univariable 
(chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate) and multivariable 
analysis.
RESULTS: 286 patients (38.2%) had poor 6-month functional outcome. Seventy-seven 
(9.3%) patients were admitted to critical care. Patients admitted to critical 
care were younger (p < 0.001), had lower GCS score (p < 0.001), larger ICH 
volume (p < 0.001), more often had intraventricular extension (p = 0.008) and 
underwent neurosurgery (p < 0.001). Critical care admission was associated with 
poor functional outcome at 6 months (39/77 [50.7%] vs 286/748 [38.2%]; 
p = 0.034); adjusted OR 2.43 [95%CI 1.36-4.35], p = 0.003), but not with death 
(OR 1.29 [95%CI 0.71-2.35; p = 0.4). In ordinal logistic regression, patients 
admitted to critical care showed an OR 1.47 (95% CI 0.98-2.20; p = 0.07) for a 
shift in the 6-month modified Rankin Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Admission to critical care is associated with poor 6-month 
functional outcome after spontaneous ICH but not with death. Patients admitted 
to critical care were a priori more severely affected. Although adjusted for 
main known predictors of poor outcome, our findings could still be confounded by 
unmeasured factors. Establishing the true effectiveness of critical care after 
ICH requires a randomised trial with clinical outcomes and quality of life 
assessments.

OBJECTIVES: We examined how caregivers who had cared for a relative at end of 
life (EoL) wished to be cared for in the event that they experienced advanced 
dementia or physical disability in the future, and what factors influenced their 
preferences for EoL care.
METHODS: In this mixed-methods study, 83 participants, recruited from multiple 
sources in Israel, were interviewed concerning socio-demographic factors, health 
status, past experience with EoL, preference for extension of life vs. quality 
of life (QoL), willingness to be dependent on others, and preferences for EoL 
care.
RESULTS: In case of advanced dementia, 58% preferred euthanasia or suicide; 
around a third chose those for physical disability. Care by family members was 
the least desired form of care in the advanced dementia scenario, although more 
desirable than institutional care in the physical disability scenario. QoL was 
rated as the highest factor impacting preferences for EoL care. Men demonstrated 
a higher preference than women for extension of life over QoL.
CONCLUSION: Our study points to the need for society to consider solutions to 
the request of participants to reject the type of EoL experienced by their 
relatives. Those solutions include investing in improving the quality of life at 
the end of life, and offering alternatives such as euthanasia, which a large 
proportion of our participants found ethically and medically appropriate within 
the current system of care in the event of severe physical disability, and more 
so in the event of advanced dementia.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin 
disorder, affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean 
basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with 
complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived 
from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from 
traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. 
Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects 
of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little 
systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an updated version of a 
previously published Cochrane Review.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with 
sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised 
Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine 
Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Dates of most recent 
searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies 
Trials Register: 17 March 2020; ISRCTN: 19 April 2020; AMED: 18 May 2020; 
ClinicalTrials.gov: 24 April 2020; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of 
all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration 
of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including 
blood transfusion and hydroxyurea.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trial quality 
and extracted data.
MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (212 participants) of three phytomedicines: Niprisan® 
(also known as Nicosan®), Ciklavit® and a powdered extract of Pfaffia paniculata 
were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan® may be 
effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over 
a six-month period (low-quality evidence). It did not appear to affect the risk 
of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). The 
single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit®) reported a possible benefit to 
individuals with painful crises, and a possible adverse effect (non-significant) 
on the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect 
of Pfaffia paniculata on the laboratory parameters and symptoms of SCD (very 
low-quality of evidence). No adverse effects were reported with Niprisan® and 
Pfaffia paniculata (low- to very low-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan® appeared to be safe and effective in 
reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials 
are required to assess its role in managing people with SCD and the results of 
its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently, no conclusions can be made 
regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit® and the powdered root extract of Pfaffia 
paniculata in managing SCD. Based on the published results for Niprisan® and in 
view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of the three trials, 
phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises 
in SCD. This needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials with 
improved study design and data collection are required on the safety and 
efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing SCD.

The increased availability of new cancer treatments in recent years has led to 
improved prognosis and increased life expectancy for cancer patients, but at the 
expense of increased cardiovascular risk. For this reason, multidisciplinary 
teams need to be formed for the joint evaluation of these patients to optimise 
the cardiovascular health and overall survival of these patients and minimise 
interruptions to onco-haematological treatments. A wide range of cardiovascular 
toxicities are associated with the various cancer treatments. The structured 
control of cardiovascular risk before, during and after oncological treatment 
will enable strategies for the prevention, early detection and early treatment 
of cardiotoxicities.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In the last few decades, there has been a 
continuous process of improvement in medical treatment and secondary prevention 
measures after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Patients 
older than 65 years are at increased risk of death due to this event. Our aim 
was to determine whether patients aged less than 65 years and 65 years and older 
experiencing a STEMI can recover a life expectancy similar to that of the 
general population of the same age, sex, and geographical region.
METHODS: We included all patients experiencing a STEMI at our institution during 
a 6-year period in an observational-study (SurviSTEMI: survival in STEMI). We 
calculated their observed survival, expected survival, and excess mortality. We 
repeated all analyses for survivors of the acute event stratifying by 65 years.
RESULTS: For patients aged <65 years who survived the STEMI, observed survival 
at 3 and 5 years of follow-up was 97.68% (95%CI, 96.05%-98.64%) and 94.14% 
(95%CI, 90.89%-96.25%), respectively. Expected survival at 3 and 5 years was 
98.12% and 96.61%. For patients ≥ 65 years who survived the STEMI, observed 
survival at 3 and 5 years was 85.52% (95%CI, 82.23%-88.24%) and 75.43% (95%CI, 
70.26%-79.83%), respectively. Expected survival at 3 and 5 years was 86.48% and 
76.56%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For survivors of the acute event, life expectancy is fairly similar 
to that of the general population of the same age, sex, and geographical region.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity has been associated with longer chronic 
disease-free life expectancy, but specific cancer types have not been 
investigated. We examined whether leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical 
activity (LTPA) and television (TV) viewing were associated with life expectancy 
cancer-free.
METHODS: We included 14,508 participants without a cancer history from the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We used multistate survival 
models to separately examine associations of LTPA (no LTPA, <median, ≥median) 
and TV viewing (seldom/never, sometimes, often/very often) with life expectancy 
cancer-free at age 50 from invasive colorectal, lung, prostate, and 
postmenopausal breast cancer. Models were adjusted for age, gender, race, ARIC 
center, education, smoking, and alcohol intake.
RESULTS: Compared with no LTPA, participants who engaged in LTPA ≥median had a 
greater life expectancy cancer-free from colorectal [men-2.2 years (95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.7-2.7), women-2.3 years (95% CI, 1.7-2.8)], lung 
[men-2.1 years (95% CI, 1.5-2.6), women-2.1 years (95% CI, 1.6-2.7)], prostate 
[1.5 years (95% CI, 0.8-2.2)], and postmenopausal breast cancer [2.4 years (95% 
CI, 1.4-3.3)]. Compared with watching TV often/very often, participants who 
seldom/never watched TV had a greater colorectal, lung, and postmenopausal 
breast cancer-free life expectancy of ∼1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Participating in LTPA was associated with longer life expectancy 
cancer-free from colorectal, lung, prostate, and postmenopausal breast cancer. 
Viewing less TV was associated with more years lived cancer-free from 
colorectal, lung, and postmenopausal breast cancer.
IMPACT: Increasing physical activity and reducing TV viewing may extend the 
number of years lived cancer-free.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the cost utility of concurrent 
chemoradiation (CCRT) to CCRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CCRT/ACT) in 
locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) using provider and societal viewpoints.
METHODS: Data from our trial which was a multi-centre study evaluating the 
efficacy of ACT compared to CCRT/ACT were entered into a decision tree model. 
The data included clinical probability, direct medical and non-medical costs, 
and utility obtained from the patients. The total cost, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were 
estimated for a time horizon of 3 years. All costs and outcomes were discounted 
at 3% annually.
RESULTS: The cost of CCRT and CCRT/ACT was approximately 3,058 and 6,896 USD and 
4,309 and 7,480 USD from provider and from societal viewpoints, respectively. 
The QALYs for CCRT and CCRT/ACT were 2.31480 and 2.32045, respectively. The ICER 
was 569,575 USD per QALY. For stage III-IVA LACC, the ICER was 28,050 USD per 
QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, the cost of ACT was the most significant 
influential parameter on the ICER. The ICER would be 0.26-fold lower if the cost 
of ACT was reduced by 25%. At the current ceiling threshold of 5,000 USD/QALY, 
CCRT had a 100% probability of being the best option.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Thai context, CCRT is more cost effective than CCRT/ACT for 
stage IIB-IVA LACC. CCRT/ACT may be considered only for stage III-IVA LACC 
because it has a lower ICER than other types of LACC.

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) disables millions in Asia and Africa. 
Epidemiological data and clinical studies in India have reported a significant 
decline in its prevalence in last century. Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 
estimated that RHD in India led to 395/100000 disability adjusted life years 
(DALYs) and 9.2/100000 deaths in 1990. This declined to 270/100000 and 
7.9/100000, respectively, in 2017. School-based epidemiological studies in India 
have reported decline in clinically diagnosed RHD. On the other hand, GBD study 
has reported that in terms of absolute numbers, India contributes to one-third 
of global RHD burden. RHD in 1990 led to 3.44 million DALYs and 80,470 deaths 
which has increased to 3.73 million DALYs and 108,460 deaths in 2017. India 
Disease Burden Initiative has reported high RHD burden in many less developed 
states of the country, e.g., Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, 
etc. Echocardiographic epidemiology studies have reported high burden of 
subclinical RHD. Significant proportions of patients in hospital-based 
echocardiographic clinics have RHD and it contributes to 25-45% of cardiac 
surgeries in government hospitals. The continuing burden of RHD needs proper 
public health and clinical response.

In filamentous fungi, hyphal growth depends on the continuous delivery of 
vesicles to the growing tips. It is unclear how fast-growing hyphae coordinate 
simultaneous cell extension and expansion in the tip cells. We have functionally 
characterized 12 TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain-containing proteins in Fusarium 
graminearum. Among them, FgMsb3 is found to regulate hyphal tip expansion and to 
be required for pathogenicity. The regulatory mechanism of FgMsb3 has been 
further investigated by genetic, high-resolution microscopy and high-throughput 
co-immunoprecipitation strategies. The FgMsb3 protein localizes at the 
polarisome and the hyphal apical dome (HAD) where it acts as a GTPase-activating 
protein for FgRab8 which is required for apical secretion-mediated growth and 
pathogenicity. Deletion of FgMSB3 causes excessive polarized trafficking but 
blocks the fusion of FgSnc1-associated vesicles to the plasma membrane. 
Moreover, we establish that FgSpa2 interacts with FgMsb3, enabling FgMsb3 
tethering to the polarisome. Loss of FgSpa2 or other polarisome components 
(FgBud6 and FgPea2) causes complete shifting of FgMsb3 to the HAD and this 
affects the polarized growth and pathogenicity of the fungus. In summary, we 
conclude that FgSpa2 regulates FgMsb3-FgRab8 cascade and this is crucial for
