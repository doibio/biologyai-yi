BACKGROUND: Despite increasing of the Belgian health expenditures, several 
indicators related to population health showed poor results. The objectives of 
this study were to perform an in-depth analysis of the secular trend of Belgian 
health status using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study results for 
Belgium, and to compare these results with other European countries.
METHODS: We collected results of the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study through 
the GBD results and visualization tools. We benchmarked Belgian GBD results with 
the other initial members of the European Union (EU15).
RESULTS: Belgium performed significantly better in 2016 than in 1990 in terms of 
age-standardized (AS) Year of Life Lost (YLL) rates but not significantly 
different in terms of AS Year Lived with Disability (YLD) and 
Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates. The contribution of AS YLDs to total 
of AS DALYs increased from 1990 (42%) to 2016 (54%). Although AS YLD and DALY 
rates did not seem to differ between Belgium and the EU15 from 1990 to 2016, the 
ranking of Belgium among the EU15 in terms of AS DALY and YLL rates was worse in 
2016 than in 1990. Belgium had significantly higher AS YLL rates for lower 
respiratory infections (B: 264 AS YLLs [95% uncertainty interval [UI] 231-301] 
per 100,000; EU15: 188 AS YLLs [95%UI 168-212] per 100,000), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (B: 368 AS YLLs [95%UI 331-407] per 100,000; EU15: 285 AS YLLs 
[95%UI 258-316] per 100,000) and tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (B: 785 AS 
YLLs [95%UI 699-879] per 100,000; EU15: 613 AS YLLs [95%UI 556-674] per 
100,000).
CONCLUSION: Belgium's ranking among the EU15 in terms of AS YLL and DALY rates 
decreased from 1990 to 2016. Significant health gains appear possible by acting 
on risk factors directly linked to a significant part of the Belgian burden of 
diseases, i.e., alcohol and tobacco consumption, and high body mass index. 
National burden of disease estimates can help defining Belgian health targets 
and are necessary as external validity of GBD results is not always guaranteed.

A variety of literature addresses the question of how the age distribution of 
deaths changes over time as life expectancy increases. However, corresponding 
terms such as extension, compression, or rectangularization are sometimes 
defined only vaguely, and statistics used to detect certain scenarios can be 
misleading. The matter is further complicated because mixed scenarios can 
prevail, and the considered age range can have an impact on observed mortality 
patterns. In this article, we establish a unique classification framework for 
realized mortality scenarios that allows for the detection of both pure and 
mixed scenarios. Our framework determines whether changes of the deaths curve 
over time show elements of extension or contraction; compression or 
decompression; left- or right-shifting mortality; and concentration or 
diffusion. The framework not only can test the presence of a particular scenario 
but also can assign a unique scenario to any observed mortality evolution. 
Furthermore, it can detect different mortality scenarios for different age 
ranges in the same population. We also present a methodology for the 
implementation of our classification framework and apply it to mortality data 
for U.S. females.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Sacubitril-Valsartan Compared with Enalapril in 
Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction in Thailand.

BACKGROUND: Sacubitril-valsartan is a new medication that has recently been 
recommended as a replacement for enalapril in the treatment of patients with 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of 
sacubitril-valsartan compared with enalapril.
METHODS: An analytical decision model was developed to estimate the long-term 
costs and outcomes from a healthcare perspective. Clinical inputs were mostly 
derived from the PARADIGM-HF study. Enalapril-related costs, risk of 
non-cardiovascular death, and all-cause readmission rate were based on data from 
Thailand. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and presented for the year 2017. 
A series of sensitivity analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: For the base-case, the increased cost (144,146 vs. 16,048 Thai baht 
[THB]) of sacubitril-valsartan was associated with gains in both life-years 
(9.214 vs. 8.367 years) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (7.698 vs. 
6.909) compared with enalapril, yielding an ICER of 162,276 THB/QALY 
($US4857.11/QALY). This ICER is not considered to be cost effective at the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) level of 160,000 THB/QALY. The risk of cardiovascular 
death and costs of both sacubitril-valsartan and hospitalization influenced the 
ICER. At a WTP of 160,000 THB/QALY, sacubitril-valsartan had a 48% probability 
of being a cost-effective treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: At its current price in Thailand, sacubitril-valsartan may not 
represent good value for the nations's limited healthcare resources. The cost of 
sacubitril-valsartan needs to reduce by approximately 2% to yield an ICER below 
the threshold.

BACKGROUND: Mucogingival deformities, and gingival recession in particular, are 
a group of conditions that affect a large number of patients. Since life 
expectancy is rising and people are retaining more teeth both gingival recession 
and the related damages to the root surface are likely to become more frequent. 
It is therefore important to define anatomic/morphologic characteristics of 
mucogingival lesions and other predisposing conditions or treatments that are 
likely to be associated with occurrence of gingival recession.
OBJECTIVES: Mucogingival defects including gingival recession occur frequently 
in adults, have a tendency to increase with age, and occur in populations with 
both high and low standards of oral hygiene. The root surface exposure is 
frequently associated with impaired esthetics, dentinal hypersensitivity and 
carious and non-carious cervical lesions. The objectives of this review are as 
follows (1) to propose a clinically oriented classification of the main 
mucogingival conditions, recession in particular; (2) to define the impact of 
these conditions in the areas of esthetics, dentin hypersensitivity and root 
surface alterations at the cervical area; and (3) to discuss the impact of the 
clinical signs and symptoms associated with the development of gingival 
recessions on future periodontal health status.
RESULTS: An extensive literature search revealed the following findings: 1) 
periodontal health can be maintained in most patients with optimal home care; 2) 
thin periodontal biotypes are at greater risk for developing gingival recession; 
3) inadequate oral hygiene, orthodontic treatment, and cervical restorations 
might increase the risk for the development of gingival recession; 4) in the 
absence of pathosis, monitoring specific sites seems to be the proper approach; 
5) surgical intervention, either to change the biotype and/or to cover roots, 
might be indicated when the risk for the development or progression of pathosis 
and associated root damages is increased and to satisfy the esthetic 
requirements of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact and the prevalence of conditions like root 
surface lesions, hypersensitivity, and patient esthetic concern associated with 
gingival recessions indicate the need to modify the 1999 classification. The new 
classification includes additional information, such as recession severity, 
dimension of the gingiva (gingival biotype), presence/absence of caries and 
non-carious cervical lesions, esthetic concern of the patient, and 
presence/absence of dentin hypersensitivity.

Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition due to a tear in the intimal 
layer of the aorta or bleeding within the aortic wall, resulting in the 
separation of the different layers of the aortic wall. Among the risk factors, 
age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and genetic disorders of the connective tissue 
have been identified. A prompt diagnosis and an adequate treatment are important 
in the management of affected patients. The type of treatment depends on the 
location and extension of the dissection. Open surgical repair is most commonly 
used for dissections involving the ascending aorta and the aortic arch, whereas 
endovascular intervention is indicated for descending aorta dissections that are 
complicated. In this paper, we will review the epidemiology, and physiopathology 
of aortic dissection and describe the appropriate management for each type of 
dissection (open surgery, endovascular or medical treatment).

Publisher: La dissection aortique est une pathologie grave et potentiellement 
mortelle. Elle résulte d’une déchirure intimale ou d’un saignement dans la paroi 
aortique, qui entraîne une séparation au sein des différentes couches de cette 
dernière. Parmi les facteurs de risque de cette pathologie, citons l’âge, 
l’hypertension artérielle, la dyslipidémie, et les atteintes génétiques du tissu 
conjonctif. Un diagnostic précis et une prise en charge adéquate et rapide sont 
déterminants dans le management des patients. Le type de traitement est 
conditionné par la localisation et l’extension de la dissection. La chirurgie 
ouverte est généralement indiquée dans les atteintes de l’aorte ascendante et de 
l’arche aortique, tandis que l’approche endovasculaire sera privilégiée dans les 
dissections de l’aorte thoracique descendante compliquées. Dans cet article, 
nous ferons un rappel succinct de l’épidémiologie et de la physiopathologie des 
dissections aortiques, puis nous décrirons la prise en charge médicale, 
chirurgicale ouverte et endovasculaire.

Venous thromboembolism is the third cardiovascular disease in Europe. The 
cornerstone of the treatment of deep vein thrombosis is anticoagulation. It aims 
at avoiding harmful complications : thrombosis extension and recurrence, 
pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. Due to low molecular weight 
heparins, and recently, to direct oral anticoagulants, most of the patients can 
get treatment as outpatients. Unfortunately, despite guideline publications, the 
management of these patients may be complicated in real life and not correspond 
to evidence-based medicine. This paper aims at helping the practitian when 
dealing with this potentially dangerous and often misleading disease. The 
management of the patient after a 3 to 6-month coagulation treatment will be 
discussed later in a dedicated paper.

Publisher: La maladie thrombo-embolique veineuse est la troisième maladie 
cardio-vasculaire en Europe. Le traitement de la thrombose veineuse repose 
essentiellement sur l’anticoagulation qui vise à prévenir de redoutables 
complications : extension et récidive de la thrombose, embolie pulmonaire et 
syndrome post-thrombotique. Grâce aux héparines de bas poids moléculaire et, 
plus récemment, aux anticoagulants oraux directs, la majorité des patients peut 
être traitée en ambulatoire. Pourtant, malgré les recommandations qui ont été 
publiées, force est de constater que celles-ci ne sont pas toujours respectées 
dans la «vraie vie». Le but de cet article est d’aider le praticien dans la 
prise en charge initiale d’une pathologie potentiellement dangereuse et parfois 
difficile à cerner. La prise en charge du patient après 3 à 6 mois de traitement 
sera discutée dans un article ultérieur.

The Effect of Medical Technology Innovations on Patient Outcomes, 1990-2015: 
Results of a Physician Survey.

BACKGROUND: Developments in diagnostics, medical devices, procedures, and 
prescription drugs have increased life expectancy and quality of life after 
diagnosis for many diseases. Previous research has shown that, overall, 
increased investment in medical technology has led to increased health outcomes. 
In addition, the value of investment in specific innovations, particularly in 
new pharmaceuticals or biopharmaceuticals, has frequently been shown through an 
evaluation of the associated health outcomes and costs. Value assessments for 
all medical technologies and interventions are an important consideration in 
current debates on access and affordability of health care in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To identify practicing physician impressions of the historical effect 
of postdiagnosis innovations in medical technology on patient outcomes within 
the 8 health conditions that have the largest effect on health in the United 
States.
METHODS: National statistics were used to identify the 8 conditions responsible 
for the most mortality and morbidity within the United States between 1990 and 
2014. A physician survey was developed for each major condition to obtain 
physician opinion on the extent to which pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals, 
medical devices, diagnostics, and surgical procedures contributed to 
improvements in postdiagnosis mortality and morbidity outcomes over the 
evaluated period. Respondents were provided with a fifth category, "cannot 
allocate," to account for postdiagnosis outcome gains resulting from other 
factors such as public health interventions.
RESULTS: The conditions identified as having the greatest effect on morbidity 
and mortality since 1990 were breast cancer, ischemic heart disease, human 
immunodeficiency virus infection, diabetes, unipolar depression, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lung cancer. After 
excluding other factors, physicians specializing in these conditions, with a 
mean of 21.4 years in practice, considered pharmaceuticals and 
biopharmaceuticals as having the greatest postdiagnosis effect across all 8 
conditions, with 56% of outcome gains attributed to this innovation category. 
Diagnostics was the second biggest contributor at 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: Physician perceptions indicated that attention should be paid to 
value assessments of innovative diagnostics, devices, and surgical procedures, 
as well as to pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals, before goals for 
allocating health care expenditures among the different innovations are 
determined.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis of an annular closure device (ACD) based on 
data from a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
OBJECTIVE.: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a 
novel ACD in a patient population at high risk for recurrent herniation 
following discectomy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbar disc herniation patients with annular defect 
widths ≥6 mm are at high risk for recurrent herniation following limited 
discectomy. Recurrent herniation is associated with worse clinical outcomes and 
greater healthcare costs. A novel ACD may reduce the incidence of recurrent 
herniation and the associated burdens.
METHODS: A decision analytical modeling approach with a Markov method was used 
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ACD versus conventional discectomy. 
Health states were created by projecting visual analogue scale (VAS) onto 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Direct costs were calculated based on Humana 
and Medicare 2014 claims to represent private and public payer data, 
respectively. Indirect costs were calculated for lost work days using 2016 US 
average annual wages. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollars 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was compared to willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted.
RESULTS: Patients with the ACD had less symptomatic reherniations, reoperations, 
and complications and gained 0.0328 QALYs within the first 2 years. Total direct 
medical costs for the ACD group were similar to control. When productivity loss 
was considered, using the ACD became $2076 cheaper, per patient, than 
conventional discectomy. Based on direct costs alone, the ICER comparing ACD to 
control equaled $6030 per QALY. When indirect costs are included, the ICER 
became negative, which indicates that superior quality of life was attained at 
less cost.
CONCLUSION: For lumbar disc herniations patients with annular defects ≥6 mm, the 
ACD was, at 2 years, a highly cost-effective surgical modality compared to 
conventional lumbar discectomy.

A scoping review of the role of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in 
noncommunicable disease care.

Stockton MA(1), Giger K(1), Nyblade L(1).

Author information:

Washington, DC, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV are increasingly burdened by noncommunicable 
diseases (NCDs) as a result of the NCD susceptibility that accompanies increased 
life expectancy and the rising global prevalence of NCDs. Health systems are 
being strengthened and programs are being developed to address this burden, 
often building on HIV care strategies and infrastructure or through integrated 
care models. HIV remains a stigmatized condition and the role of HIV stigma in 
the provision of NCD care is not well understood.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping literature review of both peer reviewed and grey 
literature to identify evidence of the role of HIV stigma in the NCD-care 
continuum (prevention, diagnosis, care seeking, retention in care, and adherence 
to treatment of NCDs). We searched PsychInfo and Pubmed and conducted additional 
searches of programmatic reports and conference abstracts. Included studies were 
published in English within the past decade and examined HIV-related stigma as 
it relates to NCD-care or to integrated NCD-and HIV-care programs.
RESULTS: Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Findings suggest: fear of 
disclosure, internalized shame and embarrassment, and negative past experiences 
with or negative perceptions of health care providers negatively influence 
engagement with NCD care; HIV stigma can adversely affect not only people living 
with HIV in need of NCD care, but all NCD patients; some NCDs are stigmatized in 
their own right or because of their association with HIV; integrating NCD and 
HIV care can both reduce stigma for people living with HIV and a present a 
barrier to access for NCD care.
CONCLUSION: Due to the dearth of available research and the variability in 
initial findings, further research on the role of HIV stigma in the NCD-care 
continuum for people living with HIV is necessary. Lessons from the field of 
HIV-stigma research can serve as a guide for these efforts.

Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Proportional-Assist Ventilation Plus vs. 
Pressure Support Ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit in Two Countries.

Heraklion, Greece.

Background: Mechanical ventilation is an integral, but expensive, part of the 
intensive care unit (ICU). Optimal use of mechanical ventilation could save 
costs and improve patient outcomes. Here, the cost effectiveness of proportional 
assist ventilation (PAV™ ventilation by Medtronic) is estimated relative to 
pressure support ventilation (PSV). Methods: A cohort-level, clinical model was 
built using data from clinical trials. The model estimates patient-ventilator 
asynchrony >10%, tracheostomy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, other nosocomial 
infections, spontaneous breathing trial success, hypoxemia, and death. Cost and 
quality of life are associated with all events, with cost effectiveness defined 
as the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the US and UK. 
Results: The mean cost of ICU care was lower with PAV™ than with PSV in the US 
and UK, but the total cost of care over 40 years was higher due to more patients 
surviving and incurring future care costs. Reduced time on mechanical 
ventilation, fewer nosocomial infections, and extended life expectancy with PAV™ 
drove QALY improvement. The cost per QALY gained with PAV™ was $8,628 and 
£2,985. Conclusion: PAV™ improves quality of life and reduces short-term costs. 
PAV™ is likely to be considered cost-effective over 40-years in the US and UK.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI), are leading causes of death among the Japanese, who have the longest life 
expectancy in the world. Over the past 50 years in Japan, the percentage of 
elderly individuals has increased 4-fold, from 5.7% in 1960 to 23.1% in 2010. To 
explore medical practices and emergency care for AMI in this aging society, the 
Japan Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (JAMIR) was established as a 
nationwide real-world database.
METHODS: JAMIR conducted retrospective analysis of 20,462 AMI patients (mean 
age, 68.8 ± 13.3 years; 15,281 men [74.7%]) hospitalized between January 2011 
and December 2013.
RESULTS: The rates of ambulance use and emergency PCI were 78.9% and 87.9%, 
respectively. The median door-to-balloon time was 80 min (interquartile range, 
53-143 min). Overall in-hospital mortality was 8.3%, including 6.6% due to 
cardiac death. JAMIR included 4837 patients aged ≥80 years (23.6%). In this age 
group, patients who underwent PCI (79.9%) had significantly lower in-hospital 
mortality than those who did not (11.1% vs. 36.9%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The large JAMIR database, with 24% of AMI patients aged ≥80 years, 
could provide useful information about medical care in an aging society. The 
reasonable in-hospital outcomes observed may justify consideration of PCI for 
patients with AMI aged ≥80 years.

We have reported an autopsy case of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) that exhibited 
persisting active inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) 
despite a 45-year-long treatment with oral corticosteroids. To our knowledge, 
our case had received the longest course of maintenance treatment. This case 
study suggests that the current treatment of NMO with immunosuppressive agents 
may offer a good prospect for improving life expectancy. On the other hand, it 
also suggest that microscopic active lesions which were clinically silent and 
difficult to detect by neurological examination or MRI studies may persist in 
the CNS in patients with NMO, despite prolonged and continuous immunosuppressive 
treatment.

NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? In order to discern 
information about testing modalities when assessing neuroplastic responses to 
squat resistance training, the present study investigated whether corticospinal 
and intracortical function was different between a joint-angle-matched isometric 
squat and isometric knee extension. What is the main finding and its importance? 
The present data show poor agreement of corticospinal and intracortical function 
between the isometric squat and isometric knee extension. The data reinforce the 
notion that task specificity is of the utmost importance for assessing 
neuroplasticity.
ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that task-specific changes in neurophysiological 
function (neuroplasticity) should be assessed using testing modalities that 
replicate the characteristics of the intervention. The squat is a commonly 
prescribed resistance exercise that has been shown to elicit changes in CNS 
function. However, previous studies have assessed squat-induced neuroplasticity 
using isometric knee extension, potentially confounding the results. The aim of 
the present study was to assess the agreement between corticospinal and 
intracortical activity relating to the knee extensors during isometric knee 
extension compared with an isometric squat task. Eleven males completed a 
neurophysiological assessment in an isometric squat (IS) and knee-extension (KE) 
task matched for joint angles (hip, knee and ankle). Single- and paired-pulse 
transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered during isometric contractions at 
a range of intensities to assess short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and 
corticospinal excitability. Group mean values for SICI (70 ± 14 versus 63 ± 12% 
of unconditioned motor evoked potential during IS and KE, respectively) and 
corticospinal excitability (mean differences 2-5% of the maximal compound muscle 
action potential at 25, 50, 75 and 100% maximal voluntary contraction between 
the IS and KE) were not different between the two tasks (P > 0.05) in the vastus 
lateralis. However, limits of agreement were wide, with poor-to-moderate average 
intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (SICI, ICC3,1  = 0.15; corticospinal 
excitability, average ICC3,1 range = 0.0-0.63), indicating disparate 
corticospinal and intracortical activity between the IS and KE. These data 
highlight the importance of task specificity when assessing the modulation of 
corticospinal excitability and SICI in response to interventions resulting in 
neuroplastic changes.

BACKGROUND: A new patient-reported health measurement model has been developed 
to quantify descriptions of health states. Known as the multi-attribute 
preference response (MAPR) model, it is based on item response theory. The 
response task in the MAPR is for a patient to judge whether hypothetical 
health-state descriptions are better or worse than his/her own health status.
METHODS: In its most simple form MAPR is a Rasch model where for each respondent 
on the same unidimensional health scale values are estimated of their own health 
status and values of the hypothetical comparator health states. These values 
reflect the quality or severity of the health states. Alternatively, the 
respondents are offered health-state descriptions that are based on a 
classification system (e.g., multi-attribute) with a fixed number of health 
attributes, each with a limited number of levels. In the latter variant, the 
weights of the levels of the attributes in the descriptive system, which 
represents the range of the health states, are estimated. The results of a small 
empirical study are presented to illustrate the procedures of the MAPR model and 
possible extensions of the model are discussed.
RESULTS: The small study that we conducted to illustrate the procedure and 
results of our proposed method to measure the quality of health states and 
patients' own health status showed confirming results.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper introduces the typical MAPR model and shows how it 
extends the basic Rasch model with a regression function for the attributes of 
the health-state classification system.

BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and head injury 
(including traumatic brain injury (TBI)) manifest in high levels across prison 
samples and guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
notes that people with acquired brain injury may have increased prevalence of 
ADHD. We aimed to examine the association of ADHD with TBI and the impact of the 
association upon health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and service use among 
imprisoned adults.
METHODS: An observational study was performed in 2011-2013, at Porterfield 
Prison, Inverness, United Kingdom (UK). The all male sample included 390 adult 
prison inmates with capacity to consent and no history of moderate or severe 
intellectual disability. Head injury was measured with a series of self-reported 
questions, addressing history of hits to the head: frequency, severity, loss of 
consciousness (LOC), and sequelae. Participants were interviewed using the 
Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults 2.0. The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 
was used to measure health status, and to calculate attribute specific HRQoL and 
Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) scores.
RESULTS: 72% of prisoners sampled reported at least one head injury in their 
lifetime. Among those, 70% of head injuries occurred before age 16 and 70% 
experienced LOC. Prisoners with ADHD were nearly twice more likely to have TBI. 
Prisoners with ADHD-only and ADHD with co-morbid TBI had significantly lower 
scores in several HRQoL attributes, compared with TBI only or the absence of 
either condition. Adjusted logistic regression models indicated an average 
reduction of 0.20 QALYs in inmates with ADHD-only and 0.30 QALY loss in those 
with ADHD with co-morbid TBI compared with inmates with neither condition.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a robust association between ADHD and TBI, and ADHD with 
co-morbid TBI confers significantly greater impairment in terms of HRQoL. 
Managing the short and long-term consequences of TBI is essential to improving 
care for prisoners and to addressing the criminogenic factors related to them.

The standard treatment for patella fractures is tension band wiring. However, 
with tension band wiring anatomical reduction and rigid fixation can be 
challenging and the clinical outcome after patella fracture is often not 
satisfying. The purpose of this prospective clinical observation was to evaluate 
the clinical outcome in patients with patella fractures treated with an angular 
stable patella plate. Between 2011 and 2015 a total of 67 patients were treated 
with an angular stable patella plate. Outcome in these patients was evaluated by 
the Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADL) and range of 
motion of the knee joint was assessed. Complete follow up was obtained for 35 
patients. In these patients, we found one implant-related complication. None of 
the patients reported any deficits in extension capabilities. The flexion was on 
average 127° (SD 21°). The patients classified the function of their knee in 
daily life on average with 77% (SD 24%) in comparison to their function before 
the trauma. Only kneeling or squatting was a problem in some patients. In 
conclusion, angular stable patella plating appears to be a promising alternative 
treatment for patella fractures. The patella plate provides increased mechanical 
stability for fracture fixation which appeared to result in a reduction of 
complications and improvement of functional outcome compared to tension band 
wiring. Especially patients with a multi-part or comminuted fracture or with 
osteoporotic bone are likely to benefit from the stability provided by the plate 
and the locking screws.

In any job setting, the sudden or expected death of a coworker can cause 
profound grief and loss. Moreover, in academic settings there are unique 
challenges that warrant further discussion. Given the aging of the nursing 
professoriate, the shortage of nursing faculty, and the medical advances 
prolonging our life expectancy, we can forecast a greater frequency of loss of 
faculty while employed. The impact of a faculty member death on colleagues, 
staff, and students can cause great distress and therefore requires careful 
attention and consideration for all. As Deans and Directors at Schools of 
Nursing, how do we navigate grief and mourning, supporting others while 
experiencing some of the same feelings ourselves? This requires a careful 
balance, as our actions can create an impact on the culture and health of our 
colleges and schools of nursing and those who work and attend classes therein.

BACKGROUND: Indigenous Australians experience poorer health outcomes than 
non-Indigenous Australians and a significant life expectancy gap exists. 
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) represents the leading specific cause of death in 
Indigenous Australians and is a significant, if not the most significant, 
contributor to the mortality gap. With this narrative review we aim to describe 
the burden of IHD within the Indigenous Australian community and explore the 
factors driving this disparity.
METHODS: A broad search of the literature was undertaken utilising an electronic 
search of the PubMed database along with national agency databases-the 
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) and the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics (ABS).
RESULTS: A complex interplay between multiple factors contributes to the excess 
burden of IHD in the Indigenous Australian population: CONCLUSIONS: In terms of 
IHD, Indigenous Australians experience disadvantage at multiple stages of the 
disease process. Ongoing efforts are needed to continue to inform clinicians of 
both this disadvantage and strategies to assist negating it. Further research is 
needed to develop evidence based practices which may help reduce this disparity 
in outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential health benefit of screening strategies for 
cardiovascular diseases primary prevention in a rural northern Chinese 
population.
METHODS: A total of 6 221 adults aged 40-74 years old, from rural Beijing, China 
and free from cardiovascular diseases at baseline were included. The following 
screening strategies were compared: Strategy 1, the strategy based on numbers of 
risk factors recommended by the Chinese Guideline for Prevention of 
Cardiovascular Diseases in people aged 40-74; Strategy 2, screening people aged 
40-74 based on the Prediction for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk in 
China (China-PAR) risk prediction model; Strategy 3, screening people aged 50-74 
using the China-PAR risk prediction model. Participates who were classified into 
medium- or high-risk by the corresponding strategies would be introduced to 
lifestyle intervention, while high risk population would take medication in 
addition. Markov model was used to compare the potential health benefits within 
10 years in each scenario, which applied the parameters from this rural northern 
Chinese cohort, published literatures, meta-analyses and systematic reviews, 
clinical trials and other cohort studies of Chinese population. Quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) events/deaths could be 
prevented and number needed to be screened (NNS) per QALY gained/per CVD event 
prevented/per CVD death prevented were calculated to compare the effectiveness. 
One-way sensitivity analysis concerning uncertainty of cardiovascular disease 
incidence rate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis about the uncertainty of 
hazard ratios were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with non-screening strategy, the potential health benefits of 
each strategy were: Strategy 1 would gain QALY of 498 (95%CI: 103-894) and 
prevent 298 (95%CI: 155-441) CVD events; Strategy 2 would gain QALY of 691 
(95%CI: 233-1 149) and prevent CVD events of 374 (95%CI: 181-567); Strategy 3 
would gain QALY of 654 (95%CI: 199-1 108) and prevent CVD events of 346 (95%CI: 
154-538). Screening strategy based on ChinaPAR risk prediction model (strategy 
2 or 3) would be generally better in terms of QALY gained, CVD events/deaths 
prevented and NNS than the strategy based on numbers of CVD risk factors (all 
P<0.05 except NNS per QALY gained and NNS per CVD event prevented in 40-74 
years). Similar benefits were obtained for the strategy 2 and 3. The results 
were consistent in the sensitivity analyses on the parameters of incidence rates 
and hazard ratios.
CONCLUSION: Screening people to target increased risks of cardiovascular 
diseases in this rural northern Chinese population is necessary. Screening 
strategy based on China-PAR risk prediction model could gain more health 
benefits than that based on numbers of CVD risk factors.
