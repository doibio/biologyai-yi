BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in general health and life expectancy in people 
with cystic fibrosis (CF), lung function decline continues unabated during 
adolescence and early adult life.
METHODS: We examined factors present at age 5-years that predicted lung function 
decline from childhood to adolescence in a longitudinal study of Australasian 
children with CF followed from 1999 to 2017.
RESULTS: Lung function trajectories were calculated for 119 children with CF 
from childhood (median 5.0 [25%-75%=5.0-5.1]) years) to early adolescence 
(median 12.5 [25%-75%=11.4-13.8] years). Lung function fell progressively, with 
mean (standard deviation) annual change -0.105 (0.049) for forced vital capacity 
(FVC) Z-score (p<0.001), -0.135 (0.048) for forced expiratory volume in 1-second 
(FEV1) Z-score (p<0.001), -1.277 (0.221) for FEV1/FVC% (p<0.001), and -0.136 
(0.052) for forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC Z-score (p<0.001). 
Factors present in childhood predicting lung function decline to adolescence, in 
multivariable analyses, were hospitalisation for respiratory exacerbations in 
the first 5-years of life (FEV1/FVC p = 0.001, FEF25-75p = 0.01) and 
bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil elastase activity (FEV1/FVC% p = 0.001, 
FEV1p = 0.05, FEF25-75p = 0.02). No examined factor predicted a decline in the 
FVC Z-score.
CONCLUSIONS: Action in the first 5-years of life to prevent and/or treat 
respiratory exacerbations and counteract neutrophilic inflammation in the lower 
airways may reduce lung function decline in children with CF, and these should 
be targets of future research.

Mastocytosis is a myeloid neoplasm defined by expansion and focal accumulation 
of clonal mast cells (MCs) in one or more organs. The disease exhibits a complex 
pathology and may be complicated by MC activation, bone abnormalities, 
neurological problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, and/or hematologic 
progression. The World Health Organization divides mastocytosis into cutaneous 
forms, systemic mastocytosis (SM) and MC sarcoma. In most patients with SM, 
somatic mutations in KIT are detected. Patients with indolent SM have a normal 
to near-normal life expectancy, whereas patients with advanced SM, including 
aggressive SM and MC leukemia, have a poor prognosis. In those with advanced SM, 
multiple somatic mutations and an associated hematologic neoplasm may be 
detected. Mediator-related symptoms can occur in any type of mastocytosis. 
Symptoms may be mild, severe, or even life-threatening. In patients with severe 
acute symptoms, an MC activation syndrome may be diagnosed. In these patients, 
relevant comorbidities include IgE-dependent and IgE-independent allergies. 
Management of patients with SM is an emerging challenge in daily practice and 
requires in-depth knowledge and a multidisciplinary and personalized approach 
with selection of appropriate procedures and interventions. In this article, we 
review the current knowledge on SM and MC activation syndrome, with emphasis on 
multidisciplinary aspects in diagnosis and patient-specific management. In 
addition, we provide a user's guide for application of markers, algorithms, 
prognostic scores, and treatments for use in daily practice.

INTRODUCTION: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is a highly effective treatment 
for acute ischaemic stroke due to large arterial occlusion (LAO). To support 
decisions about service provision, we previously estimated the annual UK 
population eligible for EVT as ∼10% of stroke admissions. Since then, several 
trials have produced evidence that could alter these figures. We update our 
estimates considering information from studies and trials reporting 2018-2021 on 
incidence, presentation time and stroke severity and consider the possible 
impact of predicted demographic changes in the next 10-20 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We produce an updated decision tree describing the EVT 
eligible population for UK stroke admissions. One-way sensitivity analyses 
(using upper and lower confidence intervals for estimates at each branch of our 
decision tree) were used to identify where further research evidence is 
necessary to increase certainty around estimates for numbers of EVT eligible 
patients.
RESULTS: The updated estimate for the number of UK stroke patients eligible for 
EVT annually was between 10,020 (no advanced imaging in early presenting 
patients) and 9,580 (advanced imaging in all early presenting patients), which 
compared with our estimates in 2017 is a minimal reduction. One-way sensitivity 
analyses established that enhanced evidence about eligibility for milder 
strokes, ASPECTS scores and pre-stroke disability are offset by evidence 
regarding a lower incidence of LAO. Importantly, predicted increases in life 
expectancy by 2040 may increase thrombectomy need by 40%.
DISCUSSION: Information from additional randomised trials published during 
2018-2020 with updated estimates of LAO prevalence had a minimal impact on 
overall estimates of stroke patients eligible for EVT in the UK. Ongoing 
research into the benefits of EVT for patients with mild stroke or European 
Stroke Journal For Peer Review lower ASPECTS scores has the potential to 
increase the estimates of the eligible population; future need for EVT will 
increase with the ageing population.
CONCLUSION: Our updated analyses show overall numbers eligible little changed, 
but evidence from ongoing trials and demographic changes have the potential to 
increase the need for EVT significantly.

The key factor of genome instability during aging is transposon dysregulation. 
This may be due to senile changes in the expression of lamins, which 
epigenetically modulate transposons. Lamins directly physically interact with 
transposons. Epigenetic regulators such as SIRT7, BAF, and microRNA can also 
serve as intermediaries for their interactions. There is also an inverse 
regulation, since transposons are sources of miRNAs that affect lamins. We 
suggest that lamins can be attributed to epigenetic factors, since they are part 
of the NURD, interact with histone deacetylases and regulate gene expression 
without changing the nucleotide sequences. The role of lamins in the 
etiopathogenesis of premature aging syndromes may be associated with 
interactions with transposons. In various human cells, LINE1 is present in the 
heterochromatin domains of the genome associated with lamins, while SIRT7 
facilitates the interaction of this retroelement with lamins. Both retroelements 
and the nuclear lamina play an important role in the antiviral response of 
organisms. This may be due to the role of lamins in protection from both viruses 
and transposons, since viruses and transposons are evolutionarily related. 
Transposable elements and lamins are secondary messengers of environmental 
stressors that can serve as triggers for aging and carcinogenesis. Transposons 
play a role in the development of cancer, while the microRNAs derived from them, 
participating in the etiopathogenesis of tumors, are important in human aging. 
Lamins have similar properties, since lamins are dysregulated in cancer, and 
microRNAs affecting them are involved in carcinogenesis. Changes in the 
expression of specif ic microRNAs were also revealed in laminopathies. Identif 
ication of the epigenetic mechanisms of interaction of lamins with transposons 
during aging can become the basis for the development of methods of life 
extension and targeted therapy of age-associated cancer.

Publisher: Дисбаланс активации транспозонов – один из важнейших факторов 
нестабильности генома при старении. Причинами этого явления могут быть 
ассоциированные с возрастом изменения экспрессии ламинов, которые влияют на 
эпигенетическую регуляцию мобильных генетических элементов. Взаимосвязь ламинов 
и транспозонов может быть обусловлена специфическим физическим контактом между 
молекулами, а также опосредована эпигенетическими регуляторами, такими как 
SIRT7, BAF и микроРНК. Характерна взаиморегуляция ламинов с мобильными 
элементами, которые являются источниками микроРНК, влияющими на ламины. Ламины 
входят в состав NURD (nucleosome remoldeling deacetylase complex), 
взаимодействуют с гистоновыми деацетилазами и регулируют экспрессию генов без 
изменения структуры нуклеотидных последовательностей. Роль ядерной ламины в 
этиопатогенезе синдромов преждевременного старения может быть обусловлена 
взаимодействием с транспозонами, так как истощение ламинов приводит к активации 
мобильных генетических элементов. В различных клетках человека LINE1 
представлены в связанных с ламинами гетерохроматиновых доменах генома, при этом 
SIRT7 способствует взаимодействию данного ретроэлемента с ядерной ламиной. В 
противовирусном ответе организмов важную роль играют как ретроэлементы, так и 
ядерная ламина. Это согласуется с ролью ламинов в защите как от вирусов, так и 
от транспозонов, которые характеризуются филогенетическим родством. Мобильные 
генетические элементы и ламины – вторичные мессенджеры средовых стрессорных 
воздействий, которые могут служить пусковыми факторами для старения и 
канцерогенеза. Транспозоны играют роль в развитии злокачественных 
новообразований, при этом происходящие от них микроРНК, участвующие в 
этиопатогенезе опухолей, имеют значение в старении человека. Сходные свойства 
типичны для ламинов, поскольку при злокачественных новообразованиях выявлена 
дисрегуляция ламинов, а влияющие на них микроРНК участвуют в канцерогенезе. 
Изменение экспрессии специфических микроРНК отмечено также при ламинопатиях. 
Определение точных эпигенетических механизмов взаимодействия ламинов с 
мобильными генетическими элементами при старении может стать основой для 
разработки методов продления жизни и таргетной терапии ассоциированных с 
возрастом злокачественных новообразований.

BACKGROUND: Most peptic ulcer cases are associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. 
pylori) infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
H. pylori eradication therapy is recommended for the treatment of H. 
pylori-positive peptic ulcers. We aimed to assess and validate the cumulative 
economic and health effects of H. pylori eradication strategy for the treatment 
of peptic ulcers compared with PPI therapy strategy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a cohort state-transition model for H. 
pylori eradication strategy and PPI therapy strategy over a lifetime horizon 
from a healthcare payer perspective. We targeted two hypothetical cohorts of H. 
pylori-positive patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers aged 20, 30, 40, 50, 
60, 70, and 80. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), life expectancy life-years (LYs), incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios, ulcer recurrence cases, and ulcer-associated deaths. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, H. pylori eradication strategy was less 
costly with greater benefits than PPI therapy strategy in all age groups. 
Cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to any variables in all age groups. 
Sensitivity analyses showed strong robustness of the results. From 2000 to 2020, 
H. pylori eradication strategy saved US$14.07 billion over a lifetime, increased 
8.65 million QALYs and 1.23 million LYs over a lifetime, and prevented 551,298 
ulcer recurrence cases and 59,465 ulcer-associated deaths, compared with PPI 
therapy strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori eradication strategy not only has contributed 
significantly to preventing ulcer recurrence and reducing ulcer-associated 
deaths but also has resulted in great cost savings. All over the world, H. 
pylori eradication strategy is likely to have yielded a comparable magnitude of 
economic and health benefits, depending on the epidemiology of H. pylori-related 
peptic ulcers and the healthcare environment in each country.

Despite the efficacy demonstrated by immunotherapy recently, liver cancer still 
remains one of the deadliest cancers, mainly due to heterogeneity of this 
disease. Continuous exploration of new therapeutics is therefore necessary. 
Chemical-induced cell differentiation can serve as a promising approach, with 
its ability to consistently remodel gene expression profile and alter cell fate. 
Inspired by advances in stem cell and reprogramming field, here it is reported 
that a small molecule cocktail (SMC) consisted of: SB431542 (TGFβ inhibitor), 
CHIR99021 (GSK3β inhibitor), BIX01294 (H3K9 methyltransferase/G9a inhibitor), 
and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), can induce differentiation of liver cancer 
cells including cell lines, primary cancer cells, cancer stem cells, and drug 
resistant cells. Treated cells lose malignant characteristics and regain 
hepatocyte phenotype instead. When applied in vivo, SMC induces wide range of 
tissue necrosis or fibrosis within the tumors, while remaining tissues begin to 
express hepatic nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), the hepatic nuclear marker. SMC also 
leads to tumor abrogation in orthotopic xenograft models and life span extension 
of animals. The powerful differentiation induction of SMC is exerted through 
modulation of Akt/mTOR/HIF1α signaling and metabolic reprogramming, as well as 
suppressing Snail and enhancing HNF4α expression. Together, these results 
highlight that chemical-induced differentiation has the potential to effectively 
treat liver cancer disregard of heterogeneity.

Coronary artery disease is a frequent comorbidity in patients with severe aortic 
stenosis undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and the need 
to ensure coronary access after TAVI is fundamental. This aspect is becoming 
increasingly relevant as TAVI indication expand to younger and lower-risk 
patients. Moreover, the longer life expectancy of subjects who are currently 
treated with TAVI could result in an increased need for TAVI-in-TAVI due to 
valve degeneration. As the implantation of a second transcatheter bioprosthesis 
might impair coronary access, TAVI-in-TAVI will be unfeasible in a significant 
proportion of cases, particularly if they received a tall-frame transcatheter 
heart valve at the time of the first intervention. Thus, patients might 
experience the paradox of needing surgical aortic valve replacement when they 
are older and frailer. Here we report the case of a patient with history of 
coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVI, presenting 
with an acute coronary syndrome 8 years after percutaneous aortic valve 
implantation. Thanks to the low frame height of the transcatheter aortic valve, 
it was possible to easily perform coronary angiography and high-risk 
percutaneous coronary intervention using hemodynamic support device (Impella 
CP). Moreover, this case highlights how the implantation of a low-frame 
transcatheter prosthesis can increase the possibility of achieving coronary 
access even after TAVI-in-TAVI, if needed.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy, developments in medicine and intracardiac 
devices, accessibility of cardiac surgery, decrease in the prevalence of 
rheumatic heart disease are changing infective endocarditis patient profile and 
thus risk factors for the adverse events. This single-center-based study 
covering the whole Latvian population aimed to assess the intrahospital and 
3-year mortality of infective endocarditis patients who underwent cardiac 
surgery, as well as risk factors and laboratory indices predictive of adverse 
outcomes of the disease.
METHODS: Clinical profiles, data of laboratory and instrumental analyses, 
operation and intensive care unit records of cardiac surgery patients treated in 
Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital, Riga, Latvia, between 2015 and 2019 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: We analyzed data from 242 episodes of surgically treated infective 
endocarditis in 233 patients. The median age of patients was 57.00 (45.00-68.00) 
years. The rate of intrahospital mortality was 11.16%. Risk factors associated 
with mortality in the univariate analyses were S. aureus infection (HR=2.27, 95% 
CI: 1.36-3.80; P=0.002) and systemic embolization of vegetations (HR=1.63, 95% 
CI: 1.00-2.64; P=0.048). Perivalvular complications (HR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.19-3.29; 
P=0.009) were found to be independently associated with mortality in 
multivariate analysis (HR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.05-3.78; P=0.035). One-year survival 
was 78.3%, whereas three-year -71.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrahospital mortality of surgically treated IE patients was 
11.2%; however, one- and three-year mortality was 21.7 and 28.7%, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus once-daily canagliflozin 300 mg in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled with metformin from the 
healthcare payer and societal perspectives in Canada.
METHODS: Head-to-head data from the SUSTAIN 8 randomised trial (NCT03136484) 
were extrapolated over 40 years using economic simulation modelling. The 
cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus canagliflozin 300 mg 
for treating T2DM was estimated using the Swedish Institute for Health 
Economics-Diabetes Cohort Model (IHE-DCM) and the Economic and Health Outcomes 
Model of T2DM (ECHO-T2DM). Unit costs and disutility weights capturing 
treatments and key macro- and microvascular complications were sourced from the 
literature to best match the Canadian setting. A probabilistic base-case 
simulation and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with reductions in macro- 
and microvascular complications, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of (Canadian dollars [CAD]) CAD16,392 and 18,098 per incremental 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus canagliflozin 300 mg for IHE-DCM 
and ECHO-T2DM, respectively, from a healthcare payer perspective. Accounting for 
productivity loss as well, ICERs were CAD14,127 and 13,188 per QALY gained for 
IHE-DCM and ECHO-T2DM, respectively, from a societal perspective. Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed that the base-case results were robust to changes in input 
parameters and assumptions used.
CONCLUSIONS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAD50,000 per QALY gained, 
once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was cost-effective over 40 years versus once-daily 
canagliflozin 300 mg for the treatment of T2DM in patients failing to maintain 
glycemic control with metformin alone.

We evaluated the cost-utility of replacing trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) 
with quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) in the current target populations in 
Uruguay. An existing decision-analytic static cost-effectiveness model was 
adapted for Uruguay. The population was stratified into age groups. Costs and 
outcomes were estimated for an average influenza season, based on observed rates 
from 2013 to 2019 inclusive. Introducing QIV instead of TIV in Uruguay would 
avoid around 740 additional influenza cases, 500 GP consultations, 15 
hospitalizations, and three deaths, and save around 300 workdays, for the same 
vaccination coverage during an average influenza season. Most of the 
influenza-related consultations and hospitalizations would be avoided among 
children ≤4 and adults ≥65 years of age. Using QIV rather than TIV would cost an 
additional ~US$729,000, but this would be partially offset by savings in 
consultations and hospitalization costs. The incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with QIV would be in the order of 
US$18,000 for both the payor and societal perspectives, for all age groups, and 
around US$12,000 for adults ≥65 years of age. The main drivers influencing the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the vaccine efficacy against the B 
strains and the percentage of match each season with the B strain included in 
TIV. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that switching to QIV would 
provide a favorable cost-utility ratio for 50% of simulations at a 
willingness-to-pay per QALY of US$20,000. A switch to QIV is expected to be 
cost-effective for the current target populations in Uruguay, particularly for 
older adults.

The effect of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity: Evidence from the U.S. and 
26 high-income countries.

University, Kravis Hall 522, 665 West 130th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA.

This study examines the impact that pharmaceutical innovation, which accounts 
for most private biomedical research expenditure, has had on longevity. We 
perform two types of two-way fixed-effects analyses, which control for the 
effects of many potentially confounding variables. First, we analyze long-run 
(2006-2018) changes in longevity associated with different diseases in a single 
country: the U.S. Then, we analyze relative longevity levels associated with 
different diseases in 26 high-income countries during a single time period 
(2006-2016). The measure of longevity we analyze, mean age at time of death, is 
strongly positively correlated across countries with life expectancy at birth. 
The measure of pharmaceutical innovation we use is the mean vintage (year of 
initial world launch) of the drugs used to treat each disease in each country. 
Changes in the vintage distribution of drugs are due to both entry of new drugs 
and exit of old drugs. Our analysis of U.S. data indicates that the diseases for 
which there were larger increases in drug vintage tended to have larger 
increases in the longevity of Americans of all races and both sexes. In other 
words, the lower the mean age of the drugs, the higher the mean age at death. We 
test, and are unable to reject, the "parallel trends" hypothesis. We estimate 
that the 2006-2018 increase in drug vintage increased the mean age at death of 
Americans by about 6 months (66% of the observed increase). Controlling for sex, 
race, and education has only a small effect on the estimate of the vintage 
coefficient. The estimates indicate that drug vintage did not have a significant 
effect on the mean age at death of decedents with less than 9 years of 
education. Drug vintage had a positive and significant effect on the mean age at 
death of decedents with at least 9 years of education, and a larger effect on 
the mean age at death of decedents with at least 13 years of education. The 
finding that pharmaceutical innovation has a larger effect on the longevity of 
people with more education is consistent with previous evidence that more 
educated people are more likely to use newer drugs. Our analysis of data on 26 
high-income countries indicates that the higher the vintage of drugs available 
to treat a disease in a country, the higher mean age at death was, controlling 
for fixed disease and country effects. The increase in drug vintage is estimated 
to have increased mean age at death in the 26 countries by 1.23 years between 
2006 and 2016-73% of the observed increase. We obtain estimates of the cost of 
pharmaceutical innovation-its impact on drug expenditure-as well as estimates of 
an important benefit of pharmaceutical innovation-the number of life-years 
gained from it-and of their ratio, i.e., the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. Estimates of the cost per life-year gained for the U.S. and the 26 
countries are $35,817 and $13,904, respectively. Both figures are well below per 
capita GDP in the respective regions, suggesting that, overall, pharmaceutical 
innovation was highly cost-effective.

Longitudinal Surveys.

BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence of improvements in health expectancy 
among the Japanese population, existing estimates are based on the prevalence of 
morbidity taken from cross-sectional survey data.
OBJECTIVES: This study employed a multistate life table approach to compute 
incidence-based health expectancy measures, namely active and inactive life 
expectancy (LE), for two longitudinal survey cohorts from 1990 to 2009.
METHODS: This study used data from two longitudinal surveys of older adults in 
Japan: the National Survey of the Japanese Elderly (1990-1999) and the Nihon 
University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging (1999-2009). We employed the 
Interpolation of Markov Chains technique to compute the number of years at age 
65 years to be spent with and without difficulty in performing activities of 
daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs.
RESULTS: We documented significant increases in active LE for men and women at 
age 65 years over the 10-year study period. There were significant changes in 
total LE for men and in the percentage of active life for women. Inactive LE did 
not significantly change across the two survey cohorts during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the health status of older adults in Japan 
has largely improved over the 10-year study period, with increases in both the 
duration of life and time spent in an active state. This finding offers evidence 
of compression of morbidity among older men and women in Japan.

This study reviews the recent progress of machine learning for the early 
diagnosis of thyroid disease. Based on the results of this review, different 
machine learning methods would be appropriate for different types of data for 
the early diagnosis of thyroid disease: (1) the random forest and gradient 
boosting in the case of numeric data; (2) the random forest in the case of 
genomic data; (3) the random forest and the ensemble in the case of radiomic 
data; and (4) the random forest in the case of ultrasound data. Their 
performance measures varied within 64.3-99.5 for accuracy, 66.8-90.1 for 
sensitivity, 61.8-85.5 for specificity, and 64.0-96.9 for the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the findings of this 
review, indeed, the following attributes would be important variables for the 
early diagnosis of thyroid disease: clinical stage, marital status, histological 
type, age, nerve injury symptom, economic income, surgery type [the quality of 
life 3 months after thyroid cancer surgery]; tumor diameter, symptoms, 
extrathyroidal extension [the local recurrence of differentiated thyroid 
carcinoma]; RNA feasures including ADD3-AS1 (downregulation), MIR100HG 
(downregulation), FAM95C (downregulation), MORC2-AS1 (downregulation), LINC00506 
(downregulation), ST7-AS1 (downregulation), LOC339059 (downregulation), 
MIR181A2HG (upregulation), FAM181A-AS1 (downregulation), LBX2-AS1

hsa-miR-146b-3p (upregulation), hsa-miR-199b-5p (downregulation), 
hsa-miR-4709-3p (upregulation), hsa-miR-34a-5p (upregulation), hsa-miR-214-3p 
(downregulation) [papillary thyroid carcinoma]; gut microbiota RNA features such 
as veillonella, paraprevotella, neisseria, rheinheimera [hypothyroidism]; and 
ultrasound features, i.e., wreath-shaped feature, micro-calcification, strain 
ratio [the malignancy of thyroid nodules].

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Comparative Kinematics in the 
Lumbopelvic Region in the Patients Suffering from Spinal Pain.

Zheng Z(1), Wang Y(1), Wang T(1), Wu Y(1), Li Y(1).

Author information:

Surgery Three Ward, Harbin, Heilonjiang, China.

BACKGROUND: Lumbopelvic kinematics has been observed to include different 
parameters and directly relate to the movement of the hip spine. In the current 
scenario, more than 65 million people have been suffering from spinal pain, and 
18% of adults experience chronic spinal pain.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis selected 9 studies for 
analysis via electronic databases like EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, 
CINAHL, and Cochrane (CENTRAL). After collecting the data, the dataset has been 
systematically analyzed through statistical methodologies using RevMan and 
Stata.
RESULTS: Out of 116 studies initially scrutinized, nine were finally selected 
for the meta-analysis. When range of motion was studied via meta-analysis, it 
was noted that a considerable reduced movement was noted in the lumbar region of 
the spine when people were suffering from lower back pain in comparison to 
control group people. Hence, reduced lumbar range of motion, no difference in 
the angle of lordosis, and no significant difference in extension and rotation 
in people with lower back pain were found. However, variability was noted in 
people suffering from lower back pain for flexion and lateral flexion. A 
significant heterogeneity was found between the studies which lacked some 
details and standardization of the criteria which were used for defining 
patients with lower back pain or without them (control group). Results show that 
spinal pain is the main reason behind the limitation of lumbar range of motion. 
It is clear from the data set of mean and standard deviation, and this is clear 
to establish the relationship between the causes of pelvic and spinal pain. In 
flexion-based ROM, the mean difference was found to be -9.77 (95% CI: -21.86, 
2.32). Similarly, for lateral flexion, the mean difference was found to be -5.58 
(with 95% CI: -10.38, -0.79).
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that spinal disease is too influential for 
people; thereby, it affects day-to-day life activities by creating painful and 
restricted movements. It is concluded that people suffering from lower back pain 
have reduced proprioception and range of movement in the lumbar region when 
compared to control groups with no lower back pain, which mainly focus on 
flexion and lateral flexion.

BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affect millions 
of individuals worldwide. Rehabilitation interventions could support individuals 
during the recovery phase of COVID-19, but a comprehensive understanding of this 
new disease and its associated needs is crucial. This qualitative study 
investigated the experience of individuals who had been hospitalized for 
COVID-19, focusing on those needs and difficulties they perceived as most 
urgent.
METHODS: This naturalistic qualitative study was part of a single-center 
mix-method cross-sectional study (REACT) conducted in Italy during the first 
peak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The qualitative data collection took place 
through a telephone interview conducted 3 months after hospital discharge. The 
experience of individuals discharged after hospitalization for COVID-19 was 
investigated through the main research question - "Tell me, how has it been 
going since you were discharged?". Two secondary questions investigated 
symptoms, activities, and participation. Data were recorded and transcribed 
verbatim within 48 h. An empirical phenomenological approach was used by the 
researchers, who independently analyzed the data and, through consensus, 
developed an interpretative model to answer the research question. Translation 
occurred after data was analyzed.
RESULTS: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, 784 individuals with 
COVID-19 were discharged from the hospitals of the Local Health Authority of the 
Province of Reggio Emilia (Italy); 446 were excluded due to the presence of 
acute or chronic conditions causing disability other than COVID-19 (n. 339), 
inability to participate in the study procedures (n. 56), insufficient medical 
documentation to allow for screening (n. 21), discharge to residential 
facilities (n. 25), and pregnancy (n. 5). Overall, 150 individuals consented to 
participate in the REACT study, and 56 individuals (60.7% male, average age 
62.8 years ±11.8) were interviewed in June-July 2020, up to data saturation. 
Persistent symptoms, feelings of isolation, fear and stigma, emotional distress, 
a fatalistic attitude, and return to (adapted) life course were the key themes 
that characterized the participants' experience after hospital discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: The experience as narrated by the participants in this study 
confirms the persistence of symptoms described in PASC and highlights the sense 
of isolation and psychological distress. These phenomena may trigger a vicious 
circle, but the participants also reported adaptation processes that allowed 
them to gradually return to their life course. Whether all individuals are able 
to rapidly activate these mechanisms and whether rehabilitation can help to 
break this vicious circle by improving residual symptoms remain to be seen.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits of aquatic physical therapy as a 
rehabilitation strategy for knee osteoarthritis patients.
METHODS: Electronic databases systematically searched up to July 2021.
RESULTS: 580 RCTs were selected. A total of thirteen studies comprising 883 
participants were included in the study. For pain, meta-analyses showed that 
aquatic physical therapy is associated with a significant change in Western 
Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain (SMD = - 1.09, 
95%CI - 1.97, - 0.21, p = 0.02) and visual analog scale (VAS) (SMD = - 0.55, 
95%CI - 0.98, - 0.12, p = 0.01). In addition, for physical function, 
meta-analyses showed that aquatic physical therapy effectively improved WOMAC 
physical function (SMD = - 0.57, 95%CI - 1.14, - 0.01, p = 0.05). However, our 
findings showed no significant improvements in symptoms of joints, quality of 
life (QOL), flexibility, and body composition with knee osteoarthritis. For 
muscle strength, we found that aquatic physical therapy can only improve knee 
extension muscle strength (MD = 2.11, 95%CI 0.02, 4.20, p = 0.05). Additionally, 
for walking ability, we observed that aquatic physical therapy effectively 
reduced Timed-Up-and-Go Test (TUGT) in a large degree (MD = - 0.89, 95%CI 
- 1.25, - 0.53, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings reported in the studies analyzed in the 
review, aquatic physical therapy had a positive effect on the pain, physical 
function, knee extension muscle strength, and walking ability among people with 
knee osteoarthritis.
