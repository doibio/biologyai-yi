INTRODUCTION: Mitral valve annuloplasty has evolved over the decades since its 
introduction and Carpentier played a major role in developing the technique. 
Mitral valve repair is preferred over replacement for severe primary mitral 
regurgitation, as it restores normal life expectancy when successful and does 
not require lifelong anticoagulation. There is an ongoing debate regarding the 
choice of ring for mitral valve annuloplasty-rigid or flexible. At present, the 
choice of ring is based on the availability of the ring and left to the 
surgeon's discretion.
METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary referral 
centre.
AIM: To compare the outcomes of mitral valve repair annuloplasty with flexible 
and rigid rings. The hospital records of 112 patients who underwent mitral valve 
annuloplasty between January 2010 and December 2014 at our hospital were 
studied. All patients were followed up for 5 years. The rigid and flexible 
groups were compared for left ventricular (LV) size regression and the presence 
of mitral regurgitation (MR).
RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients had no progression of mitral 
regurgitation at 5-year follow-up, compared with the immediate postoperative 
period. The choice of the ring (rigid and flexible) did not affect the 
recurrence of mitral regurgitation. At 5-year follow-up, three patients (2 
patients in the rigid group and 1 patient in the flexible group) had 3+ MR. One 
of the two patients in the rigid group had poor functional status and underwent 
mitral valve replacement (MVR). The other two patients (one in the rigid group 
and one in the flexible group) with 3+ MR had class II NYHA symptoms and were on 
medical follow-up. The left ventricular internal diameter diastolic (LVIDD) 
measured 59.1 mm in the flexible ring group and 56.76 mm in the rigid group 
preoperatively and these values reduced to 48.4 mm and 47.3 mm, at 5-year 
follow-up respectively. The mean left ventricular internal diameter systolic 
(LVIDS) size regression at 5 years was 4.5 ± 6.09 mm in the flexible ring group 
and 3.2 ± 7.17 mm in the rigid ring group and the difference is not 
statistically significant (p value 0.314). The mean LVIDD size regression at 
5 years was 10.62 ± 6.57 mm in the flexible ring group and 9.38 ± 9.29 mm in the 
rigid ring group and the difference is not statistically significant (p value 
0.408).
CONCLUSION: The choice of rigid or flexible ring did not have a marked 
difference on the outcome of mitral valve annuloplasty at midterm follow-up.

Syndrome.

Epigenetics has achieved a profound impact in the biomedical field, providing 
new experimental opportunities and innovative therapeutic strategies to face a 
plethora of diseases. In the rare diseases scenario, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome 
(BWS) is a pediatric pathological condition characterized by a complex molecular 
basis, showing alterations in the expression of different growth-regulating 
genes. The molecular origin of BWS is associated with impairments in the genomic 
imprinting of two domains at the 11p15.5 chromosomal region. The first domain 
contains three different regions: insulin growth like factor gene (IGF2), H19, 
and abnormally methylated DMR1 region. The second domain consists of cell 
proliferation and regulating-genes such as CDKN1C gene encoding for cyclin 
kinase inhibitor its role is to block cell proliferation. Although most cases 
are sporadic, about 5-10% of BWS patients have inheritance characteristics. In 
the 11p15.5 region, some of the patients have maternal chromosomal 
rearrangements while others have Uniparental Paternal Disomy UPD(11)pat. Defects 
in DNA methylation cause alteration of genes and the genomic structure 
equilibrium leading uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is a typical 
tumorigenesis event. Indeed, in BWS patients an increased childhood tumor 
predisposition is observed. Here, we summarize the latest knowledge on BWS and 
focus on the impact of epigenetic alterations to an increased cancer risk 
development and to metabolic disorders. Moreover, we highlight the correlation 
between assisted reproductive technologies and this rare disease. We also 
discuss intriguing aspects of BWS in twinning. Epigenetic therapies in clinical 
trials have already demonstrated effectiveness in oncological and 
non-oncological diseases. In this review, we propose a potential 
"epigenetic-based" approaches may unveil new therapeutic options for BWS 
patients. Although the complexity of the syndrome is high, patients can be able 
to lead a normal life but tumor predispositions might impair life expectancy. In 
this sense epigenetic therapies should have a supporting role in order to 
guarantee a good prognosis.

Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs in approximately 1% of the population over 65 
years of age and has become increasingly more common with advances in age. The 
number of individuals older than 60 years has been increasing in modern 
societies, as well as life expectancy in developing countries; therefore, PD may 
pose an impact on the economic, social, and health structures of these 
countries. Oxidative stress is highlighted as an important factor in the genesis 
of PD, involving several enzymes and signaling molecules in the underlying 
mechanisms of the disease. This review presents updated data on the involvement 
of oxidative stress in the disease, as well as the use of antioxidant 
supplements in its therapy.

Plant by-products obtained from agro-industrial processes require valorisation 
to demonstrate their potential for enhancing animal health, meat production, and 
shelf life extension. One example is the fast-growing hemp industry, which 
produces seeds, leaves, seed oil, and cake. Studies on the nutritional value of 
hempseed cake have shown it can be a valuable source of protein in ruminant 
diets. However, there is limited documentation on the bioavailability and 
bioefficacy of hemp phytochemicals for improving ruminant health, production, 
and extending meat shelf life. The current review provides an overview of 
existing information on nutrient and phytochemical composition of hemp 
by-products, their bioavailability, and bioefficacy, and explores current 
limitations and prospects regarding their valorisation.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elongation of life expectancy had led to marked increase 
in number of elderly patients with localized prostate cancer. However, the 
standard treatment for such patients is not well determined because of a high 
prevalence of comorbidities and slow growth of prostate cancer. The aim of this 
study is to examine the feasibility of radiotherapy for elderly patients aged 
≥80 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 96 patients aged ≥80 years and 2333 younger 
patients (aged 60-79 years) using multi-institutional data included cT1-T4N0M0 
prostate cancer treated with 902 external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and 1527 
brachytherapy (BT).
RESULTS: The 5-year biochemical failure-free survival rate was similar between 
elderly ≥80 years and younger control (91.3% vs. 85.9%, p = 0.6171) (100%, 
92.9%, 82.4% and 96.3%, 93.7%, 89% for low, intermediate and high risk group), 
and for the prostate cancer-specific survival rate (100% and 99.3%, p = 0.6171). 
The accumulated incidence of late gastrointestinal (GI) at 5 years was also 
similar between elderly and younger patients (3.5% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.6857). 
Brachytherapy improved biochemical control rate and reduced GI toxicity compared 
with EBRT, however, enhanced late genitourinary (GU) toxicity, especially in 
elderly patients. Elderly received brachytherapy showed highest rate of late GU 
toxicity grade ≥2 of 22.1% than the younger counterparts of 12.7% at 5 years, 
whereas younger patients treated with EBRT had 2.4% and elderly EBRT had 2.7% 
(p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients aged ≥80 years showed equivalent biochemical 
control, prostate cancer-related survival, and gastrointestinal toxicity 
profiles to younger patients. Meticulous care should be required for 
brachytherapy enhanced late GU toxicity, especially in elderly patients aged 
≥80 years.

Fusarium wilt of spinach, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, is an 
important disease during warm conditions in production regions with acid soils, 
yet little is known about what confers pathogenicity to spinach in F. oxysporum 
f. sp. spinaciae genetically. To identify candidate fungal genes that contribute 
to spinach Fusarium wilt, each of 69 geographically diverse F. oxysporum 
isolates was tested for pathogenicity on each of three spinach inbreds. 
Thirty-nine isolates identified as F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae caused 
quantitative differences in disease severity among the inbreds that revealed two 
distinct pathogenicity groups of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Putative 
effector gene profiles, predicted from whole-genome sequences generated for nine 
F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae isolates and five nonpathogenic, 
spinach-associated F. oxysporum (NPS) isolates, distinguished the F. oxysporum 
f. sp. spinaciae isolates from the NPS isolates, and separated the F. oxysporum 
f. sp. spinaciae isolates into two groups. Five of the putative effector genes 
appeared to be unique to F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, as they were not found 
in 222 other publicly available genome assemblies of F. oxysporum, implicating 
potential involvement of these genes in pathogenicity to spinach. In addition, 
two combinations of the 14 known Secreted in Xylem (SIX) genes that have been 
affiliated with host pathogenicity in other formae speciales of F. oxysporum 
were identified in genome assemblies of the nine F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae 
isolates, either SIX8 and SIX9 or SIX4, SIX8, and SIX14. Characterization of 
these putative effector genes should aid in understanding mechanisms of 
pathogenicity in F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, developing molecular tools for 
rapid detection and quantification of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae, and 
breeding for resistance to Fusarium wilt in spinach.[Formula: see text]

Glucocorticoid steroids are widely used as immunomodulatory agents in acute and 
chronic conditions. Glucocorticoid steroids such as prednisone and deflazacort 
are recommended for treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy where their use 
prolongs ambulation and life expectancy. Despite this benefit, glucocorticoid 
use in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is also associated with significant adverse 
consequences including adrenal suppression, growth impairment, poor bone health 
and metabolic syndrome. For other forms of muscular dystrophy like the limb 
girdle dystrophies, glucocorticoids are not typically used. Here we review the 
experimental evidence supporting multiple mechanisms of glucocorticoid action in 
dystrophic muscle including their role in dampening inflammation and myofiber 
injury. We also discuss alternative dosing strategies as well as novel steroid 
agents that are in development and testing, with the goal to reduce adverse 
consequences of prolonged glucocorticoid exposure while maximizing beneficial 
outcomes.

Disparities are differences in health outcomes among groups that originate from 
sources including historically experienced social injustice and broadly defined 
environmental exposures. Large health disparities exist, defined by many factors 
including race/ethnicity, sex, age, geography, and socioeconomic status. 
Studying disparities relies on measures of disease burden. Traditional measures, 
such as mortality, may be less applicable to neurological disorders, which often 
lead to substantial morbidity and lower quality of life, without necessarily 
causing death. Measures such as disability-adjusted life-years or healthy life 
expectancy may be more appropriate for assessing neurological disease and permit 
comparisons across diseases and communities. There are many approaches that can 
be used to study disparities. Analyses of population-based observational 
studies, patient registries, and administrative data all contribute to the 
understanding of disparities in humans. Animal and other experimental designs, 
including clinical trials, may be used to identify mechanisms and strategies to 
reduce disparities. All of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses. 
Ultimately, understanding and mitigating disparities will require use of all of 
these methods. Crucially, a focus on not only improving outcomes among all 
individuals in society but minimizing or eliminating differences between those 
with better outcomes and those who have historically been disadvantaged should 
drive the ongoing investigations into disparities. This review is focused on 
epidemiological approaches to examining the depth and determinants of 
racial-ethnic disparities in the United States related to stroke, stroke care, 
and stroke outcomes.

Starvation caused by adverse feeding stresses or food shortages has been 
reported to result in sleep loss in animals. However, how the starvation signal 
interacts with the central nervous system is still unknown. Here, the 
adipokinetic hormone (AKH)-Fork head Box-O (FOXO) pathway is shown to respond to 
energy change and adjust the sleep of Drosophila through remodeling of the s-LNv 
(small ventral lateral neurons) dorsal projections. Our results show that 
starvation prevents flies from going to sleep after the first light-dark 
transition. The LNvs are required for starvation-induced sleep loss through 
extension of the pigment dispersing factor (PDF)-containing s-LNv dorsal 
projections. Further studies reveal that loss of AKH or AKHR (akh receptor) 
function blocks starvation-induced extension of s-LNv dorsal projections and 
rescues sleep suppression during food deprivation. FOXO, which has been reported 
to regulate synapse plasticity of neurons, acts as starvation response factor 
downstream of AKH, and down regulation of FOXO level considerably alleviates the 
influence of starvation on s-LNv dorsal projections and sleep. Taking together, 
our results outline the transduction pathways between starvation signal and 
sleep, and reveal a novel functional site for sleep regulation.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic 
conditions. As life expectancy is increasing so does the prevalence of 
multimorbidity. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity in 
Cyprus and identify the most prevalent diseases.
METHODS: A representative sample of n = 1140 individuals over 18 years old was 
surveyed during 2018-2019. Demographic characteristics as well as the presence 
of chronic conditions, including mental disorders, were collected through a 
standardized questionnaire. Diseases were classified according to the 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10).
RESULTS: The age and gender standardized prevalence of multimorbidity was 28.6%. 
Multimorbidity was associated with age (p<0.001), with the highest rate observed 
among people aged 65+ years old (68.9%). Multimorbidity was higher in women than 
men (28.2% vs. 22.5%, p < .001) but similar in urban and rural regions (26.4% 
vs. 23.8%, p = 0.395). The most prevalent chronic diseases among people with 
multimorbidity were hyperlipidemia (44.7%), followed by hypertension (37.5%), 
gastric reflux (23.9%), and thyroid diseases (22.2%), while the most common 
combinations of diseases were in the circulatory and endocrine systems. The 
profile of the multimorbid individual indicated this to be a person at an older 
age with a higher BMI, a current smoker with a higher salary.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one quarter of the general population of Cyprus has 
multimorbidity, and this rate is almost 70% among the elderly. Multimorbidity is 
relatively common even in younger ages too. This underlines the need for 
prevention strategies and health awareness programs for the entire population.

The global regulatory implementation and acceptance of a science and risk-based 
stability (SRB) strategies for a stable drug product is reviewed. This stability 
strategy may also be referred to as "lean stability" since it includes a 
stability protocol reduction in the number of tests and time points than might 
normally be applied. A product line extension (new solid dosage form) for a 
well-understood product was used as a test case for this stability strategy. The 
drug product line extension was filed globally with a proposed reduction to 
analytical stability tests and frequency. This stability protocol is aligned 
with the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q1A (R2) stability 
guidelines (ICH: Guideline Q1A(R2), 2003), the World Health Organization (WHO) 
(WHO INT. [Online], 2020), and most country regulatory guidelines. Although this 
strategy was not accepted universally, the strategy enabled opportunities to 
engage in productive dialogs with regulatory authorities in several countries on 
how the case leveraged product understanding and development knowledge to 
develop a fit for purpose stability protocol. A persistent and consistent effort 
from industry to move toward product-specific protocols based on product 
knowledge and stability risk assessments should lead to further acceptance of 
science and risk-based stability strategies in all regions.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been 
investigated at high-dose to modulate tumor microenvironment acidification thus 
restoring chemotherapeutic sensitivity. This is the first trial to study 
activity and safety of repurposing high dose rabeprazole combined with 
metronomic capecitabine (mCAP).
METHODS: A phase II study in which patients with gastrointestinal cancer, 
refractory to standard treatments, who had a life expectancy >3 months, were 
blind randomized 1:1 to mCAP, 1500 mg/daily, continuously with or without 
rabeprazole 1.5 mg/kg bid, three days a week. The primary endpoint was 3-months 
progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were clinical benefit 
(CB) and overall survival (OS). Safety and plasma concentrations of capecitabine 
and its metabolites (5'-DFUR and 5-FU) were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven (median age 69 years; 63% male; 84% colorectal cancer, 76% 
ECOG-PS ≤ 1; 84% pretreated with two or more lines of chemotherapy) out of 90 
patients screened for eligibility, were randomized to receive mCAP+rabeprazole 
(n = 32) vs. mCAP (n = 35). All patients were evaluable for response. No 
significant difference between mCAP+rabeprazole vs. mCAP, in terms of 3-months 
PFS rate (HR = 1.43, 95%CI 0.53-3.85; p = 0.477), median PFS (HR = 1.22, 95%CI 
0.75-2.00, p = 0.420), CB (RR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.29-2.44; p = 0.786) and median OS 
(HR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.54-1.48; p = 0.664) was observed. However, a 3-year OS rate 
of 10% and 12% was reported in the mCAP-rabeprazole and mCAP groups, 
respectively. Overall, no grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurred but grade 1 or 2 
adverse event of any type were more frequently in the mCAP+rabeprazole group 
than in the mCAP (OR 2.83, 95%CI 1.03-7.79; p = 0.043). Finally, there was not 
statistically significant difference in the plasma concentration of capecitabine 
and its metabolites between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the adjunct of high dose rabeprazole to mCAP was not shown 
to affect mCAP activity, as PPI are being investigated worldwide as drugs to be 
repositioned in cancer treatment and also considering the limited sample size as 
well as the favorable safety profile of the combination in the present study, 
further clinical investigations are desirable.

We investigated whether countries with higher coverage of childhood live 
vaccines [BCG or measles-containing-vaccine (MCV)] have reduced risk of COVID-19 
related mortality, accounting for known systems differences between countries. 
In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available 
national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion 
of people vaccinated during the last 15 years, was associated with lower 
COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV 
coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for a validated summary 
score accounting for life expectancy and healthcare quality indicators, the 
Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI). The magnitude of association between 
BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage 
had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While 
there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the 
vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 
testing rate, HAQI, and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level 
associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health 
systems and policies. Cluster randomized studies of booster vaccines would be 
ideal to evaluate the efficacy of trained immunity in preventing COVID-19 
infections and mortality in vaccinated individuals and on community 
transmission.

INTRODUCTION: In 2017, the Aurum Institute, with support from Unitaid, launched 
an initiative to expand short-course therapy for the prevention of tuberculosis 
(TB) in 12 high-burden countries. This study aimed to investigate the importance 
of "catalytic" effects beyond the original project timeframe when estimating 
cost-effectiveness of such large investments.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the IMPAACT4TB (I4TB) initiative 
from a health system perspective, using a 10-year time horizon. We first 
conservatively estimated costs using a "top-down" approach considering only the 
direct health benefits of providing TB preventive therapy to people initiating 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) through I4TB activities. We then re-estimated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of I4TB incorporating the costs and health 
benefits of potential catalytic effects beyond the program itself.
RESULTS: We estimated that TB preventive therapy through the I4TB initiative 
alone would prevent 14 201 cases of active TB and 1562 TB deaths over 10 years 
with an up-front investment of $52.5 million; the estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness was $1580 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. 
If this initiative could achieve its desired catalytic effects, an additional 
375 648 cases and 41 321 deaths could be averted, at an incremental cost of 
$546 million and cost-effectiveness of $713 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide donors with reasonable evidence of value for 
money to support investment in short-course TB preventive therapy for people 
initiating ART in high-burden settings. Our study also illustrates the 
importance of considering long-term secondary ("catalytic") effects when 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of large-scale initiatives designed to change 
a global policy landscape.

Mortality statistics based on underlying cause of death are challenged by 
increased life expectancy and the growing share of population reaching ages 
associated with frequent multi-morbidity (with death likely resulting from 
interactions between multiple diseases). We provide a novel way of analysing 
causes of death: accounting for all causes mentioned on death certificates and 
summarizing this information along two dimensions emblematic of ageing 
populations-multi-morbidity and frailty. We implement this classification for 
all deaths at ages 50+ in Italy in 2014. Multi-morbid processes represent the 
majority of deaths, rising from 43 per cent at ages 50-54 to 63 per cent at ages 
85-89. Multi-morbidity at death is more frequent among males, although age 
patterns are identical for both sexes. About one in four deaths involves frailty 
symptoms, rising to 45 per cent at ages 95+. Mortality rates involving frailty 
are very similar for both sexes. Supplementary material is available for this

Father absence has a small but robust association with earlier age at menarche 
(AAM), likely reflecting both genetic confounding and an environmental influence 
on life history strategy development. Studies that have attempted to 
disambiguate genetic versus environmental contributions to this association have 
shown conflicting findings, though genomic-based studies have begun to establish 
the role of gene-environment interplay in the father absence/AAM literature. The 
purpose of this study was to replicate and extend prior genomic work using the 
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective 
longitudinal cohort study (N = 2,685), by (a) testing if an AAM polygenic score 
(PGS) could account for the father absence/AAM association, (b) replicating G×E 
research on lin-28 homolog B (LIN28B) variation and father absence, and (c) 
testing the G×E hypothesis using the PGS. Results showed that the PGS could not 
explain the father absence/AAM association and there was no interaction between 
father absence and the PGS. Findings using LIN28B largely replicated prior work 
that showed LIN28B variants predicted later AAM in father-present girls, but 
this AAM-delaying effect was absent or reversed in father-absent girls. Findings 
are discussed in terms genetic confounding, the unique biological role of 
LIN28B, and using PGSs for G×E tests.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of childhood cancer often is assumed to be costly in 
African settings, thereby limiting advocacy and policy efforts. The authors 
determined the cost and cost-effectiveness of maintaining childhood cancer 
centers across 4 hospitals throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: Within hospitals representing 4 countries (Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, 
and Zimbabwe), cost was determined either retrospectively or prospectively for 
all inputs related to operating a pediatric cancer unit (eg, laboratory costs, 
medications, and salaries). Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on the 
annual number of newly diagnosed patients, survival rates, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Cost per new diagnosis ranged from $2400 to $31,000, attributable to 
variances with regard to center size, case mix, drug prices, admission 
practices, and the treatment abandonment rate, which also affected survival. The 
most expensive cost input was found to be associated with medication in Kenya, 
and medical personnel in the other 3 centers. The cost per disability-adjusted 
life-year averted ranged from 0.3 to 3.6 times the per capita gross national 
income. Childhood cancer treatment therefore was considered to be very 
cost-effective by World Health Organization standards in 2 countries and 
cost-effective in 1 additional country. In all centers, abandonment of treatment 
was common; modeling exercises suggested that public funding of treatment, 
additional psychosocial personnel, and modifications of inpatient policies would 
increase survival rates while maintaining or even improving cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Across various African countries, childhood cancer treatment units 
represent cost-effective interventions. Cost-effectiveness can be increased 
through the control of drug prices, appropriate policy environments, and 
decreasing the rate of treatment abandonment. These results will inform national 
childhood cancer strategies across Africa.

PURPOSE: Health utilities (HUs) are quantitative measures of quality of life 
that are used to derive outcomes such as quality-adjusted life years in 
cost-effectiveness analyses. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there are no HUs 
for cancer. This study aimed to generate HU estimates for various health states 
associated with cancer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: Adult citizens of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, patients with cancer, 
and patients without cancer were recruited to participate in an online version 
of the Time Trade-Off (TTO) survey, a direct method that asks participants to 
indicate the amount of time they are willing to trade off in return for full 
health. The time horizon was 10 years. Patients were surveyed on their own 
health state; patients without cancer were presented with a scenario describing 
stage III colon cancer and were asked to act as proxies.
RESULTS: Mean HU score was 0.398 (n = 398), 0.315 for patients with cancer (n = 
199), and 0.482 for patients without cancer (n = 199). Among patients, the 
largest subgroup with colorectal cancer (n = 105), had a mean HU of 0.296; the 
subgroup with the lowest mean HU was patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 3; 
0.047), and the subgroup with the highest mean HU was patients with 
cholangiocarcinoma (n = 5; 0.508). Overall, the initial stage I subgroup (n = 7) 
had a mean HU of 0.456; initial stage II (n = 25), 0.240; stage II (n = 67), 
0.319; and initial stage IV (n = 77), 0.320.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study of this size to elicit HU 
scores for cancer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Patients may have had 
clinically worse disease than the patients in the scenario that was presented to 
patients without cancer. Further analyses are warranted for specific types of 
cancer. These HUs can in turn be applied in cost-utility analyses.

Candida albicans-related bloodstream infections are often associated with 
infected central venous catheters (CVC) triggered by microbial adhesion and 
biofilm formation. We utilized single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) and flow 
chamber models to investigate the adhesion behavior of C. albicans yeast cells 
and germinated cells to naïve and human blood plasma (HBP)-coated CVC tubing. 
Germinated cells demonstrated up to 56.8-fold increased adhesion forces to CVC 
surfaces when compared to yeast cells. Coating of CVCs with HBP significantly 
increased the adhesion of 60-min germinated cells but not of yeast cells and 
30-min germinated cells. Under flow conditions comparable to those in major 
human veins, germinated cells displayed a flow directional-orientated adhesion 
pattern to HBP-coated CVC material, suggesting the germ tip to serve as the 
major adhesive region. None of the above-reported phenotypes were observed with 
germinated cells of an als3Δ deletion mutant, which displayed similar adhesion 
forces to CVC surfaces as the isogenic yeast cells. Germinated cells of the 
als3Δ mutant also lacked a clear flow directional-orientated adhesion pattern on 
HBP-coated CVC material, indicating a central role for Als3 in the adhesion of 
germinated C. albicans cells to blood exposed CVC surfaces. In the common model 
of C. albicans, biofilm formation is thought to be mediated primarily by yeast 
cells, followed by surface-triggered the formation of hyphae. We suggest an 
extension of this model in which C. albicans germ tubes promote the initial 
adhesion to blood-exposed implanted medical devices via the germ tube-associated 
adhesion protein Als3.
