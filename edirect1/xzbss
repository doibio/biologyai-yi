The ancestral eukaryotes presumably had an MTOC (microtubule organizing center) 
which late gave origin to the centriole and the flagellar axoneme. The 
centrosome of insect early spermatids is in general composed of two components: 
a single centriole and a cloud of electron-dense pericentriolar material (PCM). 
During spermiogenesis, the centriole changes its structure and gives rise to a 
flagellar axoneme, while the proteins of PCM, gamma tubulin in particular, are 
involved in the production of microtubules for the elongation and shaping of 
spermatid components. At the end of spermiogenesis, in many insects, additional 
material is deposited beneath the nucleus to form the centriole adjunct (ca). 
This material can also extend along the flagellum in two accessory bodies (ab) 
flanking the axoneme. Among Homoptera Sternorrhyncha, a progressive modification 
of their sperm flagella until complete disappearance has been verified. In the 
Archaeococcidae Matsucoccus feytaudi, however, a motile sperm flagellum-like 
structure is formed by an MTOC activity. This finding gives support to the 
hypothesis that an evolutionary reversal has occurred in the group and that the 
cell, when a non-functional centriole is present, activates an ancestral 
structure, an MTOC, to form a polarized motile bundle of microtubules restoring 
sperm motility. The presence and extension of the centriole adjunct in the 
different insect orders is also enlisted.

Alzheimer Disease (AD) is the most common primary cause of dementia with a 
burgeoning epidemic as life expectancy and general medical care improve 
worldwide. Recent data from pathologic studies has shown that the cooccurrence 
of other neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies is in fact the rule rather 
than the exception. In late onset AD, cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is 
almost invariably co-existent to a greater or lesser extent and is known to 
promote cognitive deterioration. Previous observational studies and clinical 
trials have largely sought to divide dementia based on predominant 
neurodegenerative or vascular mechanisms. Given the high degree of overlap, 
findings from such studies may be difficult to interpret and apply to population 
cohorts. Additionally opportunities may be lost for uncovering novel 
interventions that target interactions between co-existent vascular and 
neurodegenerative pathologies. In the current review, we consider potential 
pathophysiologic mechanisms through which SVD may be associated with and promote 
AD pathology. In particular we explore shared environmental and genetic 
associations and how these may converge via neuroinflammatory pathways 
potentially providing novel therapeutic targets. SVD has heterogenous 
manifestations on cerebral imaging and at pathology. We discuss how studying SVD 
topography may enable us to better identify those at risk for more rapid 
cognitive decline and improve future clinical trial design.

In the development of inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines for cultured 
fish, viral titers harvested from the cultured cells would be the most important 
factor for the determination of vaccine's cost effectiveness. In this study, we 
hypothesized that the lengthening of cell survival time by the inhibition of 
apoptosis can lead to an increase of the final titer of viral hemorrhagic 
septicemia virus (VHSV). To test the hypothesis, we investigated the effects of 
a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, on VHSV infection-mediated 
apoptosis in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells and on the VHSV titers. 
VHSV infection induced the DNA laddering in EPC cells, and the progression of 
DNA fragmentation was in proportion to the CPE extension. The progression of DNA 
fragmentation in EPC cells infected with VHSV was clearly inhibited by exposure 
to Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, and the inhibition was intensified according to the increase 
of the inhibitor concentration. These results confirmed the previous reports 
that the death of host cells by VHSV infection is through apoptosis. Cells 
infected with a recombinant VHSV, rVHSV-ΔNV-eGFP, that was generated from our 
previous study by replacement of the NV gene ORF with the enhanced green 
fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene ORF, showed earlier and more distinct DNA 
fragmentations compared to the cells infected with wild-type VHSV, suggesting 
the inhibitory role of the NV protein in VHSV-mediated apoptosis that was 
previously reported. The final viral titers in the supernatant isolated from 
Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK treated cells after showing an extensive CPE were significantly 
higher than the viral titers from cells infected with virus alone, indicating 
that the delay of apoptosis by Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK extended the survival time of EPC 
cells, which lengthen the time for VHSV replication in the cells. In conclusion, 
Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK-mediated inhibition of apoptosis significantly increased the 
final titers of both wild-type VHSV and rVHSV-ΔNV-eGFP, indicating that 
apoptosis inhibition can be a way to get higher titers of VHSV.

INTRODUCTION: The cost-effectiveness of first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy in epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR)-mutated advanced-stage 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poorly documented. We therefore conducted 
a cost-effectiveness analysis of first-line treatment with erlotinib versus 
standard chemotherapy in European patients with advanced-stage EGFR-mutated 
NSCLC who were enrolled in the European Erlotinib versus Chemotherapy trial.
METHODS: The European Erlotinib versus Chemotherapy study was a multicenter, 
open-label, randomized phase III trial performed mainly in Spain, France, and 
Italy. We based our economic analysis on clinical data and data on resource 
consumption (drugs, drug administration, adverse events, and second-line 
treatments) collected during this trial. Utility values were derived from the 
literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for 
the first-line treatment phase and for the overall strategy from the perspective 
of the three participating countries. Sensitivity analyses were performed by 
selecting the main cost drivers.
RESULTS: Compared with standard first-line chemotherapy, the first-line 
treatment with erlotinib was cost saving (€7807, €17,311, and €19,364 for Spain, 
Italy and France, respectively) and yielded a gain of 0.117 quality-adjusted 
life-years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that, given a 
willingness to pay at least €90,000 for 1 quality-adjusted life-year, the 
probability that a strategy of first-line erlotinib would be cost-effective was 
100% in France, 100% in Italy, and 99.8% in Spain.
CONCLUSION: This economic analysis shows that first-line treatment with 
erlotinib, versus standard chemotherapy, is a dominant strategy for EGFR-mutated 
advanced-stage NSCLC in three European countries.

being?

The individual lumbar lordosis and lumbar motion have been identified to play an 
important role in pathogenesis of low back pain and are essential references for 
preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation. The clinical "gold-standard" 
for measuring lumbar lordosis and its motion are radiological "snap-shots" taken 
while standing and during upper-body flexion and extension. The extent to which 
these clinically assessed values characterise lumbar alignment and its motion in 
daily life merits discussion. A non-invasive measurement-system was employed to 
measure lumbar lordosis and lumbar motion in 208 volunteers (age: 20-74yrs; ♀/♂: 
115/93). For an initial short-term measurement, comparable with the clinical 
"snap-shot", lumbar lordosis and its motion were assessed while standing and 
during flexion and extension. Subsequently, volunteers were released to their 
daily lives while wearing the device, and measurements were performed during the 
following 24h. The average lumbar lordosis during 24h (8.0°) differed 
significantly from the standardised measurement while standing (33.3°). Ranges 
of motion were significantly different throughout the day compared to standing 
measurements. The influence of the factors age and gender on lordosis and its 
motion resulted in conflicting results between long- and 
short-term-measurements. In conclusion, results of short-term examinations 
differ considerably from the average values during real-life. These findings 
might be important for surgical planning and increase the awareness of the 
biomechanical challenges that spinal structures and implants face in real-life. 
Furthermore, long-term assessments of spinal alignment and motion during daily 
life can provide valid data on spinal function and can reveal the importance of 
influential factors.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the cost-utility of population-based alcohol 
interventions. One barrier to research has been the lack of preference weights 
needed to calculate Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Preference weights can 
be estimated from measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The 
objective of this study was to describe preference weights for the full spectrum 
of alcohol use.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included participants in both the National 
Health Interview Survey (NHIS; 1999-2002) and the Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey (MEPS; 2000-2003). The AUDIT-C alcohol screen was derived from NHIS with 
scores categorized into 6 groups (0,1-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-12 points), ranging 
from nondrinking (0) to very severe unhealthy alcohol use (10-12). AUDIT-C 
scores were mapped to EQ-5D and SF-6D preference weights using the linked 
datasets and analyses adjusted for demographics.
RESULTS: Among 17,440 participants, mean EQ-5D and SF-6D preference weights were 
0.82 (95% CI 0.82-0.83) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.80), respectively. Adjusted 
EQ-5D preference weights for nondrinking (0.80; 95% CI 0.79-0.81) and moderate 
unhealthy drinking (0.85; 95% CI 0.84-0.86) were significantly different from 
low-risk drinking (0.83; 95% CI 0.83-0.84), but no other differences were 
significant. Results for the SF-6D were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides EQ-5D and SF-6D preference weights for various 
alcohol use categories in a representative U.S. adult sample. However, neither 
measure suggested meaningful differences in HRQOL based on AUDIT-C categories. 
Self-reported alcohol consumption may not be associated with preference weights 
or generic instruments may not capture alcohol-related differences in HRQOL.

Long-lived species such as elephants, whales and primates exhibit extended 
post-fertile survival compared to species with shorter lifespans but data on 
age-related fecundity and survival are limited to few species or populations. We 
assess relationships between longevity, reproductive onset, reproductive rate 
and age for 834 longitudinally monitored wild female African elephants in 
Amboseli, Kenya. The mean known age at first reproduction was 13.8 years; only 
5 % commenced reproduction by 10 years. Early reproducers (<12.5 years) had 
higher age-specific fertility rates than did females who commenced reproduction 
late (15+ years) with no differences in survival between these groups. 
Age-specific reproductive rates of females dying before 40 years were reduced by 
comparison to same-aged survivors, illustrating a mortality filter and 
reproductive advantages of a long life. Overall, 95 % of fertility was completed 
before 50, and 95 % of mortality experienced by age 65, with a mean life 
expectancy of 41 years for females who survived to the minimum age at first 
birth (9 years). Elephant females have a relatively long period (c. 16 years) of 
viability after 95 % completed fertility, although reproduction does not 
entirely cease until they are over 65. We found no evidence of increased 
investment among females aged over 40 in terms of delay to next birth or calf 
mortality. The presence of a mother reproducing simultaneously with her daughter 
was associated with higher rates of daughter reproduction suggesting advantages 
from maternal (and grandmaternal) co-residence during reproduction.

A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a computer program, which is 
designed to assist health care professionals with decision making tasks. A 
well-developed CDSS weighs the benefits of therapy versus the cost in terms of 
loss of quality of life and financial loss and recommends the decision that can 
be expected to provide maximum overall benefit. This article provides an 
introduction to developing CDSSs using Bayesian networks, such CDSS can help 
with the often complex decisions involving transplants. First, we review Bayes 
theorem in the context of medical decision making. Then, we introduce Bayesian 
networks, which can model probabilistic relationships among many related 
variables and are based on Bayes theorem. Next, we discuss influence diagrams, 
which are Bayesian networks augmented with decision and value nodes and which 
can be used to develop CDSSs that are able to recommend decisions that maximize 
the expected utility of the predicted outcomes to the patient. By way of 
comparison, we examine the benefit and challenges of using the Kidney Donor Risk 
Index as the sole decision tool. Finally, we develop a schema for an influence 
diagram that models generalized kidney transplant decisions and show how the 
influence diagram approach can provide the clinician and the potential 
transplant recipient with a valuable decision support tool.

Ophthalmology, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.

PURPOSE: Glaucoma patients are still at risk of becoming blind. It is of 
clinical significance to determine the risk of blindness and its causes to 
prevent its occurrence. This systematic review estimates the number of treated 
glaucoma patients with end-of-life visual impairment (VI) and blindness and the 
factors that are associated with this.
METHODS: A systematic literature search in relevant databases was conducted in 
August 2014 on end-of-life VI. A total of 2574 articles were identified, of 
which 5 on end-of-life VI. Several data items were extracted from the reports 
and presented in tables.
RESULTS: All studies had a retrospective design. A considerable number of 
glaucoma patients were found to be blind at the end of their life; with up to 
24% unilateral and 10% bilateral blindness. The following factors were 
associated with blindness: (1) baseline severity of visual field loss: advanced 
stage of glaucoma or substantial visual field loss at the initial visit; (2) 
factors influencing progression: fluctuation of intraocular pressure (IOP) 
during treatment, presence of pseudoexfoliation, poor patient compliance, higher 
IOP; (3) longer time period: longer duration of disease and older age at death 
because of a longer life expectancy; and (4) coexistence of other ocular 
pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Further prevention of blindness in glaucoma patients is needed. To 
reach this goal, it is important to address the risk factors for blindness 
identified in this review, especially those that can be modified, such as 
advanced disease at diagnosis, high and fluctuating IOP, and poor compliance.

1. CT is superior to pulmonary function tests and chest radiography for the 
assessment and monitoring of cystic fibrosis (CF)-related lung disease and, 
also, of pediatric bronchiectasis not caused by CF (hereafter referred to as 
non-CF bronchiectasis). 2. Low-dose CT protocols that impart radiation doses 
similar to those used in chest radiography are feasible for the surveillance of 
patients with bronchiectasis. 3. Chest radiography is still most commonly used 
as the first-line imaging examination of choice for the assessment of acute 
complications related to bronchiectasis. 4. Pulmonary MRI, with or without the 
use of inhaled hyperpolarized gas, can be performed to obtain functional 
information, and, in dedicated centers, it may yield imaging results comparable 
to those obtained by CT. 5. Gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary 
manifestations of CF are observed with greater frequency in adults, because of 
increased life expectancy.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) responds to many kinds of stressors to 
maintain homeostasis. Although the ANS is believed to regulate stress tolerance, 
the exact mechanism underlying this is not well understood. To understand this, 
we focused on longevity genes, which have functions such as lifespan extension 
and promotion of stress tolerance. To understand the relationship between ANS 
and longevity genes, we analyzed stress tolerance of Caenorhabditis elegans 
treated with octopamine, which has an affinity to noradrenaline in insects, and 
acetylcholine. Octopamine and acetylcholine did not show resistance against 
H2O2, but the neurotransmitters promoted thermotolerance via DAF-16. However, 
chronic treatment with octopamine and acetylcholine did not extend the lifespan, 
although DAF-16 plays an important role in longevity. In conclusion, our results 
show that octopamine and acetylcholine activate DAF-16 in response to stress, 
but chronic induction of octopamine and acetylcholine is not beneficial for 
increasing longevity.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune disorders 
characterized by the chronic and progressive inflammation of various organs, 
most notably the synovia of joints leading to joint destruction, a shorter life 
expectancy, and reduced quality of life. Although we have substantial 
information about the pathophysiology of the disease with various groups of 
immune cells and soluble mediators identified to participate in the 
pathogenesis, several aspects of the altered immune functions and regulation in 
RA remain controversial. Animal models are especially useful in such scenarios. 
Recently research focused on IL-17 and IL-17 producing cells in various 
inflammatory diseases such as in RA and in different rodent models of RA. These 
studies provided occasionally contradictory results with IL-17 being more 
prominent in some of the models than in others; the findings of such 
experimental setups were sometimes inconclusive compared to the human data. The 
aim of this review is to summarize briefly the recent advancements on the role 
of IL-17, particularly in the different rodent models of RA.

Neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) can result in lower and upper urinary 
tract complications and eventually even in end-stage kidney failure. Since the 
driving force of this clinical cascade is high bladder pressure, controlling 
intravesical pressure in NDO patients improves both quality of life and 
life-expectancy in these patients. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) has proven its 
efficacy in reducing intravesical pressure and in reducing incontinence 
episodes. BTX-A also improves quality of life in patients with NDO. Both 
onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox(®), Allergan, Irvine, USA) and abobotulinumtoxinA 
(Dysport(®), Ipsen, Paris, France) have a level A recommendation for 
NDO-treatment. The recommended dose for intradetrusor injections in NDO patients 
is 200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA or 500 U of abobotulinumtoxinA. The drug is 
generally administered extratrigonal in the detrusor muscle, via cystoscopic 
guided injection at 20 sites in 1 mL injections. Intradetrusor BTX-A injections 
are safe, with mostly local complications such as urinary tract infection and 
high post-void residual or retention. The effect of the toxin lasts for 
approximately 9 months. Repeat injections can be performed without loss of 
efficacy. Different injection techniques, novel ways of BTX-A administration, 
eliminating the need for injection or new BTX-A types with better/longer 
response rates could change the field in the future.

We assessed the impact of hip fracture on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
and costs in Estonia. The mean 18-month HRQoL loss in quality adjusted life 
years (QALY) was estimated at 0.31, and the average cumulative cost from a 
societal perspective was 8146 euros per hip fracture patient.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of hip fracture on 
HRQoL, resource consumption, and cost over 18 months after the fracture among 
individuals aged over 50 in Estonia.
METHODS: A cohort of 205 hip fracture patients ≥50 years was followed up for 
18 months. HRQoL was estimated before fracture (recall), after fracture, and at 
4, 12, and 18 months using the EQ-5D instrument. Health care utilization and 
costs were obtained from a public health insurance fund database; social, 
informal, and indirect costs were estimated using patient-reported data.
RESULTS: Hip fracture resulted in the mean 18-month HRQoL loss of 0.31 QALYs. 
The mean 18-months cumulative cost of hip fracture from a societal perspective 
was estimated at 8146 (95 % CI 6236-10717) euros per patient. Most of the cost 
was related to health care (56 %) and informal care (33 %), while social care 
contributed only 5 %. Utilization of outpatient rehabilitation and nursing care 
was low (8 % of patients).
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of hip fracture on HRQoL and cost was substantial. 
Despite appropriate inpatient care, utilization of rehabilitation, nursing care, 
and social care were low and potentially insufficient to meet the needs of 
patients with low HRQoL. The shortfall may partially explain a remarkably high 
use of informal care.

Chronic kidney diseases affect thousands of people worldwide. Although 
hemodialysis alleviates the situation by filtering the patient's blood, it does 
not replace other kidney functions such as hormone release or homeostasis 
regulation. Consequently, orthotopic transplantation of donor organs is the 
ultimate treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal failure. 
Unfortunately, the number of patients on the waiting list far exceeds the number 
of donors. In addition, recipients must remain on immunosuppressive medications 
for the remainder of their lives, which increases the risk of morbidity due to 
their weakened immune system. Despite recent advancements in whole organ 
transplantation, 40% of recipients will face rejection of implanted organs with 
a life expectancy of only 10 years. Bioengineered patient-specific kidneys could 
be an inexhaustible source of healthy kidneys without the risk of immune 
rejection. The purpose of this article is to review the pros and cons of several 
bioengineering strategies used in recent years and their unresolved issues. 
These strategies include repopulation of natural scaffolds with a patient's 
cells, de-novo generation of kidneys using patient-induced pluripotent stem 
cells combined with stepwise differentiation, and the creation of a patient's 
kidney in the embryos of other mammalian species.

BACKGROUND: In 2009, the European Medicines Agency granted approval for two 
higher-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. This study aims to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of universal infant (<2 years old) vaccination with a 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in comparison with a 10-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) for the prevention of pneumococcal 
disease in Germany.
METHODS: A population-based Markov model was developed to estimate the impact of 
PCV13 and PCV10 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), non-invasive pneumonia 
(PNE), and acute otitis media (AOM) over a time horizon of 50 years. The model 
included the effects of the historical vaccination scheme in infants as well as 
indirect herd effects and replacement disease. We used German epidemiological 
data to calculate episodes of IPD, PNE, and AOM, as well as direct and indirect 
effects of the vaccination. Parameter uncertainty was tested in univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the ICER of PCV13 versus PCV10 infant 
vaccination was EUR 9826 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or EUR 
5490 per life-year (LY) gained from the societal perspective and EUR 3368 per 
QALY gained or EUR 1882 per LY gained from the perspective of the German 
statutory health insurance. The results were particularly sensitive to the 
magnitude of indirect effects of both vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal infant vaccination with PCV13 is likely to be a 
cost-effective intervention compared with PCV10 within the German health care 
system, if additional net indirect effects of PCV13 vaccination are significant.

With improved life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, CF-related 
diabetes (CFRD) has become a major complication. The oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT) is the standard test to detect it. However, the use of OGTT is 
controversial, in addition to being a burden for patients and the treatment 
team. Research to find alternative ways of testing is ongoing. While some 
propose that glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) may be an effective alternative, our 
past results suggest otherwise. A new analysis involving the OGTT and HbA1c 
values of 207 patients, between 2004 and 2015, proposes that the threshold of a 
lower value of HbA1c of ≥5.8%(39.9 mmol/mol) gives a sensitivity of 68.2% and a 
specificity of 60.5%. With such sensitivity to identify patients in need of an 
OGTT, 31.8% of CFRD diagnosis would be missed if the suggested HbA1c value of 
≥5.8% was used as a screening tool to identify patients in need of OGTTs. 
Considering our results, we believe the HbA1c does not possess the 
characteristics of a suitable screening test for CFRD.

Background and purpose - Childhood fractures are associated with lower peak bone 
mass (a determinant of osteoporosis in old age) and higher adult fracture risk. 
By examining time trends in childhood fracture epidemiology, it may be possible 
to estimate the vector of fragility fracture risk in the future. Patients and 
methods - By using official inpatient and outpatient data from the county of 
Skåne in Sweden, 1999-2010, we ascertained distal forearm fractures in children 
aged ≤ 16 years and estimated overall and age- and sex-specific rates and time 
trends (over 2.8 million patient years) and compared the results to earlier 
estimations in the same region from 1950 onwards. Results - During the period 
1999-2010, the distal forearm fracture rate was 634 per 10(5) patient years (750 
in boys and 512 in girls). This was 50% higher than in the 1950s with a 
different age-rate distribution (p < 0.001) that was most evident during 
puberty. Also, within the period 1999-2010, there were increasing fracture rates 
per 10(5) and year (boys +2.0% (95% CI: 1.5-2.6), girls +2.4% (95% CI: 
1.7-3.1)). Interpretation - The distal forearm fracture rate in children is 
currently 50% higher than in the 1950s, and it still appears to be increasing. 
If this higher fracture risk follows the children into old age, numbers of 
fragility fractures may increase sharply-as an upturn in life expectancy has 
also been predicted. The origin of the increase remains unknown, but it may be 
associated with a more sedentary lifestyle or with changes in risk behavior.

Deaths: Final Data for 2013.

Xu J, Murphy SL, Kochanek KD, Bastian BA.

OBJECTIVES: This report presents final 2013 data on U.S. deaths, death rates, 
life expectancy, infant mortality, and trends, by selected characteristics such 
as age, sex, Hispanic origin, race, state of residence, and cause of death.
METHODS: Information reported on death certificates, which are completed by 
funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, is 
presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state 
registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database 
through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death 
are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 
Tenth Revision.
RESULTS: In 2013, a total of 2,596,993 deaths were reported in the United 
States. The age-adjusted death rate was 731.9 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard 
population, a record low figure, but the decrease in 2013 from 2012 was not 
statistically significant. Life expectancy at birth was 78.8 years, the same as 
in 2012. Age-specific death rates decreased in 2013 from 2012 for age groups 
15–24 and 75–84. Age-specific death rates increased only for age group 55–64. 
The 15 leading causes of death in 2013 remained the same as in 2012, although 
Accidents (unintentional injuries), the 5th leading cause of death in 2012, 
became the 4th leading cause in 2013, while Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke), 
the 4th leading cause in 2012, became the 5th leading cause of death in 2013. 
The infant mortality rate of 5.96 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013 was a 
historically low value, but it was not significantly different from the 2012 
rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Although statistically unchanged from 2012, the decline in the 
age-adjusted death rate is consistent with long-term trends in mortality. Life 
expectancy in 2013 remained the same as in 2012.

Treatment of newly-diagnosed patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CP-CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) results in near-normal 
life expectancy. However, CP-CML patients resistant to initial TKIs face a 
poorer prognosis and significantly higher CML-related mortality. We conducted a 
systematic literature review to evaluate the specific causes of deaths (diseases 
progression versus drug-related) in CP-CML patients receiving second- or 
third-line therapy. We identified eight studies based on our criteria that 
reported causes of death. Overall, 5% of second-line and 10% of third-line 
patients died during the study follow-up period. For second-line, (7 studies, 
n=1926), mortality was attributed to disease progression for 41% of deaths, 2% 
to treatment-related causes, 3% were treatment-unrelated, and 50% were 
unspecified adverse events (AEs), not likely related to study drug. In 
third-line, (2 studies, n=144), 71% deaths were attributed to disease 
progression, 7% treatment-related AEs, 14% treatment-unrelated and 7% 
unspecified AEs. Annual death rates for second- and third-line therapy were 
significantly higher than for general population in similar age group. Our 
findings suggest death attributed to disease progression is approximately 10 
times that due to treatment-related AEs in patients with CP-CML receiving 
second- or third-line therapy. Therefore, the potential benefits of effective 
treatment for these patients with the currently available TKIs outweigh the 
risks of treatment-induced AEs.

BACKGROUND: The increasing elderly population is an inevitable trend worldwide 
in developed countries. Therefore, we aimed to assess the experience of a 
tertiary pancreatic center with a very homogenous population comprising only 
patients diagnosed with PDAC of the pancreatic head in patients older than 75 
years of age compared to their younger counterparts regarding the benefit in 
life expectancy and tumor biological aggressiveness.
METHODS: 300 patients underwent partial pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pylorus 
preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) for PDAC of the pancreatic head 
between 2002 and 2012 and were evaluated with regard to their co-morbidities, 
clinicopathological and perioperative variables, postoperative morbidity, 
mortality and long term survival. Therefore, two groups according to the age at 
the procedure (A: <75 years, n = 241, B: ≥75 years, n = 59) were designed.
RESULTS: There were no differences between groups with regard to gender, 
performed procedure (PPPD or PD), operation time, blood loss, tumor invasiveness 
and grade of tumor differentiation, R-status, lymph node ratio, 30-day 
mortality, length of stay and adjuvant chemotherapy. Extended resections 
including total pancreatectomy were slightly more often performed in younger 
patients (p = 0.071) and trended toward a higher rate of surgical complications 
in patients <75 years of age (p = 0.183). A higher rate of preoperative 
co-morbidities in elderly patients (group B), was associated with more 
postoperative non-surgical complications (p = 0.002) in this group of patients. 
However, the median overall survival (19.2 vs. 18.4 months) did not differ 
significantly between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Major pancreatic surgery for ductal adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreatic head is justified in elderly patients. With careful patients' 
selection and prudent perioperative management, elderly patients will have a 
similar long term outcome despite the higher rate of postoperative morbidity 
based on non-surgical complications.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that is required for the maintenance of 
telomere repeats. Although overexpression of telomerase in normal human somatic 
cells is sufficient to overcome replicative senescence, the ability of 
telomerase to promote tumorigenesis requires additional activities that are 
independent of its role in telomere extension. Here, we identify 
proliferation-associated nucleolar antigen 120 (NOL1, also known as NOP2) as a 
telomerase RNA component (TERC)-binding protein that is found in association 
with catalytically active telomerase. Although NOL1 is highly expressed in the 
majority of human tumor cells, the molecular mechanism by which NOL1 contributes 
to tumorigenesis remained unclear. We show that NOL1 binds to the T-cell factor
