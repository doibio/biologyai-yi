In this paper, we describe the evolution of the proactive care of older patients 
undergoing surgery (POPS) service and how through the use of comprehensive 
geriatric assessment methodology and intervention throughout the surgical 
pathway, outcomes for complex older surgical patients can be improved.

Bearing Surfaces for Total Hip Arthroplasty.

Lachiewicz PF(1), Kleeman LT, Seyler T.

Author information:

Chapel Hill, NC, and the Durham VA Hospital, Durham, NC (Dr. Lachiewicz) and the 
Duke University Medical Center, Chapel Hill (Dr. Kleeman and Dr. Seyler).

Metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene is considered the preferred bearing 
surface for conventional total hip arthroplasty because of its safety profile 
and excellent results in the first 10 to 15 years of use. However, with younger 
patient age, activity expectations increase, and the life expectancy of patients 
with total hip arthroplasty also has increased, so interest remains in other 
bearing couples. These other options include the use of various ceramic 
composites for the femoral head on highly cross-linked polyethylene, the 
so-called second-generation antioxidant polyethylenes, and ceramic acetabular 
liners. Several of these bearing couples have shown excellent wear rates in 
vitro, and short-term clinical studies have demonstrated favorable wear and 
safety results. It is uncertain whether any of these bearing couples should be 
adopted at present. Understanding the unique properties and possible 
complications of these bearing couples is critical for appropriate implant 
selection.

OBJECTIVES: Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time models are one of the most 
commonly used statistical methods to adjust for treatment switching in oncology 
clinical trials. The method is often applied in a decision analytic model 
without appropriately accounting for additional uncertainty when determining the 
allocation of health care resources. The aim of the study is to describe novel 
approaches to adequately account for uncertainty when using a Rank Preserving 
Structural Failure Time model in a decision analytic model.
METHODS: Using two examples, we tested and compared the performance of the novel 
Test-based method with the resampling bootstrap method and with the conventional 
approach of no adjustment. In the first example, we simulated life expectancy 
using a simple decision analytic model based on a hypothetical oncology trial 
with treatment switching. In the second example, we applied the adjustment 
method on published data when no individual patient data were available.
RESULTS: Mean estimates of overall and incremental life expectancy were similar 
across methods. However, the bootstrapped and test-based estimates consistently 
produced greater estimates of uncertainty compared with the estimate without any 
adjustment applied. Similar results were observed when using the test based 
approach on a published data showing that failing to adjust for uncertainty led 
to smaller confidence intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the bootstrapping and test-based approaches provide a solution 
to appropriately incorporate uncertainty, with the benefit that the latter can 
implemented by researchers in the absence of individual patient data.

BACKGROUND: Brief interventions (BIs) delivered in primary care have shown 
potential to increase physical activity levels and may be cost-effective, at 
least in the short-term, when compared with usual care. Nevertheless, there is 
limited evidence on their longer term costs and health benefits.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of BIs to promote physical 
activity in primary care and to guide future research priorities using value of 
information analysis.
METHODS: A decision model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of three 
classes of BIs that have been used, or could be used, to promote physical 
activity in primary care: 1) pedometer interventions, 2) advice/counseling on 
physical activity, and (3) action planning interventions. Published risk 
equations and data from the available literature or routine data sources were 
used to inform model parameters. Uncertainty was investigated with probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, and value of information analysis was conducted to 
estimate the value of undertaking further research.
RESULTS: In the base-case, pedometer interventions yielded the highest expected 
net benefit at a willingness to pay of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. 
There was, however, a great deal of decision uncertainty: the expected value of 
perfect information surrounding the decision problem for the National Health 
Service Health Check population was estimated at £1.85 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the use of pedometer BIs is the most 
cost-effective strategy to promote physical activity in primary care, and that 
there is potential value in further research into the cost-effectiveness of 
brief (i.e., <30 minutes) and very brief (i.e., <5 minutes) pedometer 
interventions in this setting.

Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of a Home Vegetable Gardening Intervention 
among Older Cancer Survivors Shows Feasibility, Satisfaction, and Promise in 
Improving Vegetable and Fruit Consumption, Reassurance of Worth, and the 
Trajectory of Central Adiposity.

Demark-Wahnefried W, Cases MG, Cantor AB, Frugé AD, Smith KP, Locher J, Cohen 
HJ, Tsuruta Y, Daniel M, Kala R, De Los Santos JF.

BACKGROUND: Holistic approaches are sought to improve lifestyle behaviors and 
health of cancer survivors long term.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore whether a home-based vegetable gardening 
intervention is feasible and whether it improves diet and other health-related 
outcomes among older cancer survivors.
DESIGN: We conducted a feasibility trial in which cancer survivors were 
randomized to receive a year-long gardening intervention immediately or to a 
wait-list control arm. Home visits at baseline and 1 year assessed physical 
performance, anthropometric indices, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes, and 
biomarkers.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 46 older (aged 60+ years) survivors 
of locoregionally staged cancers across Alabama from 2014 to 2016. Forty-two 
completed 1-year follow-up.
INTERVENTION: Cooperative extension master gardeners delivered guidance to 
establish three seasonal vegetable gardens at survivors' homes. Plants, seeds, 
and gardening supplies were provided.
OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were feasibility targets of 80% accrual and 
retention, and an absence of serious adverse events; other outcomes were 
secondary and explored potential benefits.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Baseline to follow-up changes were assessed within and 
between arms using paired t, McNemar's, and χ2 tests.
RESULTS: This trial proved to be safe and demonstrated 91.3% retention; 70% of 
intervention participants rated their experience as "excellent," and 85% would 
"do it again." Data suggest significantly increased reassurance of worth (+0.49 
vs -0.45) and attenuated increases in waist circumference (+2.30 cm vs +7.96 cm) 
in the gardening vs control arms (P=0.02). Vegetable and fruit consumption 
increased by approximately 1 serving/day within the gardening arm from baseline 
to follow-up (mean [standard error]=1.34 [1.2] to 2.25 [1.9] servings/day; 
P=0.02)] compared to controls (1.22 [1.1] to 1.12 [0.7]; P=0.77; between-arm 
P=0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: The home vegetable gardening intervention among older cancer 
survivors was feasible and suggested improvements in vegetable and fruit 
consumption and reassurance of worth; data also suggest attenuated increases in 
waist circumference. Continued study of vegetable gardening interventions is 
warranted to improve health, health behaviors, and well-being of older cancer 
survivors.

Whether health values should be elicited from the perspective of patients or the 
general public is still an open debate. The overall aim of this paper is to 
increase knowledge on the role of experience in health preference-based 
valuation research. The objectives of this paper are threefold. First, we 
elaborate the idea of experience-based (EB) values under the informed value or 
knowledge viewpoint. We think the whole scope of knowledge about the health 
states involved in valuation exercises is not fully integrated in the previous 
literature. For instance, personal knowledge based on past experiences, 
contemplating the health state as a likely future condition, knowing someone who 
is currently experiencing the state, or just receiving detailed information 
about the health states; all these situations capture different nuances of 
health-related experience which are not explicitly referred to in valuation 
tasks. Second, we propose a framework where the extended factor of experience is 
detached from other factors interwoven into the valuation exercise. Third, we 
examine how experience is tackled in different value sets (EB or non-EB) 
identified via a literature review. We identified the following elements (and 
items) in a value set: health state (without description, described using a 
multi-attribute instrument, described using other method), reference person (the 
respondent; other person, similar/known/hypothetical), time frame (past, 
present, future), raters (public, representative/convenience; vested interest, 
patients/other) and experience (personal experience, past/present/future; 
vicarious experience, affective/non-affective; no experience). Forty-nine 
valuation exercises were extracted from 22 reviewed papers and classified 
following our suggested set of elements and items. The results show that the 
role of experience reported in health valuation-related papers is frequently 
disregarded or, at most, minimised to the item of personal experience 
(present)-linked to self-reported health.

The modern climate trend and population growth have dramatically increased the 
need for maximization of the net benefit from the existing storage space in 
freshwater reservoirs. However, sedimentation in reservoirs through physical 
deposition and/or slope failures is a major threat to their productivity and 
life expectancy. In this context, the sedimentation impact on the sustainability 
of Mornos Lake/Reservoir, which is exceptionally vital for the ~ 3.1 million 
inhabitants of Athens, had to be evaluated. Therefore, a meticulous geophysical 
survey of the reservoir bed was conducted in 2015 for the very first time. 
Bathymetric, sidescan sonar, and seismic profiling datasets, all integrated with 
real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning, were analyzed for a realistic evaluation 
of the storage capacity loss. Approximately 18.2 × 106 m3 of lacustrine 
sediments derived through physical wedge-type deposition process and 
~ 800,000 m3 of material produced by slope failures have covered the bottom 
since reservoir commissioning in 1981. This configures an average storage 
capacity loss of ~ 0.07% per year, which, however, is one of the lowest rates 
worldwide. Moreover, the 108-m-deep reservoir basin can presently accommodate a 
maximum active water volume of ~ 740 × 106 m3. The siltation pattern and 
sediment transport pathways in the reservoir are principally controlled by 
vigorous turbidity underflows, which deliver sediment mainly to the dam area 
(deposition thickness up to ~ 7 m) as well as to the pumping area (deposition 
thickness up to ~ 4 m) posing there a future risk; nevertheless, according to 
the predicted lake bathymetry, this risk will be negligible till 2045.

BACKGROUND: People with locally advanced lung cancer have a poor prognosis. 
Physicians are unable to accurately predict life expectancy of patients. The 
aims of this retrospective study were to identify the life spans of individuals 
after radiotherapy of stage III carcinoma of the lung and to determine whether 
potential prognostic factors could identify people with distinct life spans.
METHODS: Between September 1981 and August 2010, 133 consecutive individuals 
underwent definitive or palliative radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) 
for stage IIIA/IIIB disease. Analysis of the survival data revealed that 14 
patients experienced long-term survival, exceeding 36 months; 94 patients had a 
short-term life span (STLS), extending between 4 and 36 months, and 25 patients 
were in the end-of-life (EOL) period, referring to the last 3 months of life. 
Recognized pre-treatment clinicopathological features were tested for their 
impact on prognosis.
RESULTS: The largest proportion of patients presenting with superior vena cava 
obstruction (SVCO) (P<0.001) and receiving palliative radiotherapy (P=0.009) 
were from the EOL group. Most of the individuals with inadequate or no health 
insurance belonged to the STLS and EOL cohorts (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis 
revealed that the presence of SVCO was an independent factor predictive of 
shortened survival/EOL status (P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that a particular disease characteristic, health 
insurance status and provision of contemporary therapy can influence individual 
longevity. Selection and prioritization of health care resources remain 
important; therefore, identification of influential prognostic factors in lung 
cancer patients deserves further scrutiny.

Bleeding is a common problem in cancer patients, related to local tumor 
invasion, tumor angiogenesis, systemic effects of the cancer, or anti-cancer 
treatments. Existing bleeds can also be exacerbated by medications such as 
bevacizumab, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and anticoagulants. 
Patients may develop acute catastrophic bleeding, episodic major bleeding, or 
low-volume oozing. Bleeding may present as bruising, petechiae, epistaxis, 
hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, hematuria, or vaginal bleeding. 
Therapeutic intervention for bleeding should start by establishing goals of 
care, and treatment choice should be guided by life expectancy and quality of 
life. Careful thought should be given to discontinuation of medications and 
reversal of anticoagulation. Interventions to stop or slow bleeding may include 
systemic agents or transfusion of blood products. Noninvasive local treatment 
options include applied pressure, dressings, packing, and radiation therapy. 
Invasive local treatments include percutaneous embolization, endoscopic 
procedures, and surgical treatment.

Due to a worldwide increase of cancer incidence and a longer life expectancy of 
patients with metastatic cancer, a rise in the incidence of symptomatic 
vertebral metastases has been observed. Metastatic spinal disease is one of the 
most dreaded complications of cancer as it is not only associated with severe 
pain, but also with paralysis, sensory loss, sexual dysfunction, urinary and 
fecal incontinency when the neurologic elements are compressed. Rapid diagnosis 
and treatment have been shown to improve both the quality and length of 
remaining life. This chapter on vertebral metastases with epidural disease and 
intramedullary spinal metastases will be discussed in terms of epidemiology, 
pathophysiology, demographics, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management. 
With respect to treatment options, our review will summarize the evolution of 
conventional palliative radiation to modern stereotactic body radiotherapy for 
spinal metastases and the surgical evolution from traditional open procedures to 
minimally invasive spine surgery. Lastly, we will review the most common 
clinical prediction and decision rules, framework and algorithms, and guidelines 
that have been developed to guide treatment decision making.

Mutations in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause familial forms of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal disorder characterized by the 
progressive loss of motor neurons. Several lines of evidence have shown that 
SOD1 mutations cause ALS through a gain of a toxic function that remains to be 
fully characterized. A significant share of our understanding of the mechanisms 
underlying the neurodegenerative process in ALS comes from the study of rodents 
over-expressing ALS-linked mutant hSOD1. These mutant hSOD1 models develop an 
ALS-like phenotype. On the other hand, hemizygous mice over-expressing wild-type 
hSOD1 at moderate levels (hSOD1WT, originally described as line N1029) do not 
develop paralysis or shortened life-span. To investigate if a decrease in 
antioxidant defenses could lead to the development of an ALS-like phenotype in 
hSOD1WT mice, we used knockout mice for the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier 
subunit [GCLM(-/-)]. GCLM(-/-) mice are viable and fertile but display a 70-80% 
reduction in total glutathione levels. GCLM(-/-)/hSOD1WT mice developed overt 
motor symptoms (e.g. tremor, loss of extension reflex in hind-limbs, decreased 
grip strength and paralysis) characteristic of mice models over-expressing 
ALS-linked mutant hSOD1. In addition, GCLM(-/-)/hSOD1WT animals displayed 
shortened life span. An accelerated decrease in the number of large neurons in 
the ventral horn of the spinal cord and degeneration of spinal root axons was 
observed in symptomatic GCLM(-/-)/hSOD1WT mice when compared to age-matched 
GCLM(+/+)/hSOD1WT mice. Our results show that under conditions of chronic 
decrease in glutathione, moderate over-expression of wild-type SOD1 leads to 
overt motor neuron degeneration, which is similar to that induced by ALS-linked 
mutant hSOD1 over-expression.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of the arthroscopic Bankart and the open Latarjet in the treatment of 
primary shoulder instability.
METHODS: This cost-effectiveness study used a Markov decision chain and 
Monte-Carlo simulation. Existing literature was reviewed to determine the 
survivorship and complication rates of these procedures. Health utility states 
(EQ-5D and quality-adjusted life-years) of the Bankart and Latarjet were 
prospectively collected. Using these variables, the Monte-Carlo simulation was 
modeled 100,000 times.
RESULTS: In reviewing the literature, the overall recurrence rate is 14% after 
the arthroscopic Bankart and 8% after the open Latarjet. Postoperative health 
utility states were equal between the 2 procedures (mean EQ-5D, 0.930; 
P = .775). The Monte-Carlo simulation showed that the Bankart had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $4214 and the Latarjet had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $4681 (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Both the arthroscopic Bankart and open Latarjet are highly 
cost-effective; however, the Bankart is more cost-effective than the Latarjet, 
primarily because of a lower health utility state after a failed Latarjet. 
Ultimately, the clinical scenario may favor Latarjet (ie, critical glenoid bone 
loss) in certain circumstances, and decisions should be made on a case by case 
basis.

The introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma (MM) has improved the life expectancy and quality of life for these 
patients in the last decade. Therefore, more patients with MM are being treated 
for repeated pathological fractures. The anaesthesiologist should continue the 
optimum supportive care received by these patients in the perioperative period 
also, by understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, the adverse effects 
of the chemotherapeutic agents and the guidelines for their supportive care. We 
report the perioperative management of a patient with MM and discuss the 
perioperative anaesthetic considerations.

Despite being characterized by some of the most threatened forest ecosystems of 
Mesoamerica, the Nicoya Peninsula is among the least known regions of 
neotropical Costa Rica in terms of its birdlife. Within this region, in the 
framework of an ongoing international cooperation program between Italy and 
Costa Rica, we had the opportunity to investigate the Karen Mogensen Reserve, a 
protected area distinguished by the presence of a variety of habitats, including 
tropical dry forest and moist forest. Species richness in the Reserve was 
relatively high compared with similar areas in northwestern Costa Rica. A series 
of surveys carried out over a 20-year period documented an avian community 
consisting of 207 species, of which 115 were breeding in the zone and another 14 
were potentially breeding. We recorded five IUCN globally Vulnerable or 
Near-Threatened species, along with six species reported for the first time from 
the Nicoya Peninsula, each representing range extension of more than 100 km. 
Twenty-six species, mostly breeding in the area, are at their southernmost range 
borders, and are likely susceptible to global environmental alterations, such as 
the effects of climate change. Furthermore, our study revealed the presence of 
two species endemic to a restricted area of Central America and four subspecies 
endemic to Costa Rica, along with breeding populations of two species that are 
geographically isolated from the main ones. The present analysis led to the 
ecological characterization of the resident avian community, showing that 65% of 
the species are strictly associated with forested environments, and especially 
with the understory or middle tree level, hence more vulnerable to environmental 
change (climatic, anthropogenic, etc.) and susceptible to local extinction. 
These results underscore the importance of the Karen Mogensen Reserve for bird 
conservation within a vulnerable environmental context, and warrant the 
continuation of periodic bird surveys, taxonomic study of isolated populations 
or endemic taxa, and improvement of local conservation measures. The data 
collected will be an important tool for future studies aimed at evaluating the 
consequences of habitat fragmentation and to monitor the effects of climate 
change on the resident avifauna. We exhort the creation of programs that 
integrate bird monitoring, ecological research, conservation initiatives, and 
the involvement of the local communities, by promoting environmental education, 
capacity-building, and income generation. To this purpose, the Karen Mogensen 
Reserve may represent a convincing model and valuable example to apply in 
similar neotropical contexts.

Purpose Gene expression profile (GEP) testing can support chemotherapy decision 
making for patients with early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor 2-negative breast cancers. This study evaluated the cost 
effectiveness of one GEP test, Onco type DX (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA), 
in community practice with test-eligible patients age 40 to 79 years. Methods A 
simulation model compared 25-year societal incremental costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of community Onco type DX use from 2005 to 
2012 versus usual care in the pretesting era (2000 to 2004). Inputs included 
Onco type DX and chemotherapy data from an integrated health care system and 
national and published data on Onco type DX accuracy, chemotherapy 
effectiveness, utilities, survival and recurrence, and Medicare and patient 
costs. Sensitivity analyses varied individual parameters; results were also 
estimated for ideal conditions (ie, 100% testing and adherence to test-suggested 
treatment, perfect test accuracy, considering test effects on reassurance or 
worry, and lowest costs). Results Twenty-four percent of test-eligible patients 
had Onco type DX testing. Testing was higher in younger patients and patients 
with stage I disease ( v stage IIA), and 75.3% and 10.2% of patients with high 
and low recurrence risk scores received chemotherapy, respectively. The 
cost-effectiveness ratio for testing ( v usual care) was $188,125 per QALY. 
Considering test effects on worry versus reassurance decreased the 
cost-effectiveness ratio to $58,431 per QALY. With perfect test accuracy, the 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $28,947 per QALY, and under ideal conditions, it 
was $39,496 per QALY. Conclusion GEP testing is likely to have a high 
cost-effectiveness ratio on the basis of community practice patterns. However, 
realistic variations in assumptions about key variables could result in GEP 
testing having cost-effectiveness ratios in the range of other accepted 
interventions. The differences in cost-effectiveness ratios on the basis of 
community versus ideal conditions underscore the importance of considering 
real-world implementation when assessing the new technology.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is associated with a shortened life 
expectancy. Statins have anti-inflammatory properties and we aimed to evaluate 
the association between the use of statins and the risk of death, progression of 
CP, and pancreatic cancer in patients with CP.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a nested case-cohort study and included 
patients with CP. We used claims of proton pump inhibitors as an active 
comparator. Patients with cirrhosis or cancer were excluded. We evaluated the 
exposure on the basis of pharmacy claims of statins. We used propensity score 
matching with a statins : nonstatins ratio of 1 : 1.
RESULTS: A total of 4807 patients were eligible for propensity score matching; 
33% were women and the mean (SD) age at cohort entry was 56 (10) years. During 
follow-up, a total of 2073 (43%) patients had died and the risk of death was 
significantly lower among patients using statins versus no statins among 678 
matched patients [hazard ratio (HR) 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.49-0.83]. Use of statins versus no statins was associated with decreased 
progression of CP, with an HR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.17-0.26). Pancreatic cancer 
occurred in 117 (2.4%) patients and we found a lower risk of pancreatic cancer 
in statin-treated patients compared with no statins, with a HR of 0.21 (95% CI: 
0.06-0.70).
CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study, we found lower risks of mortality, disease 
progression, and pancreatic cancer in patients with CP using statins. The study 
is limited by its retrospective design, but supports the hypothesis that statins 
may affect the course of CP.

Reducing health inequality is a major policy concern for low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) on the path to universal health coverage. However, health 
inequality impacts are rarely quantified in cost-effectiveness analyses of 
health programmes. Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) is a method 
developed to analyse the expected social distributions of costs and health 
benefits, and the potential trade-offs that may exist between maximising total 
health and reducing health inequality. This is the first paper to show how DCEA 
can be applied in LMICs. Using the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in 
Ethiopia as an illustrative example, we analyse a hypothetical re-designed 
vaccination programme, which invests additional resources into vaccine delivery 
in rural areas, and compare this with the standard programme currently 
implemented in Ethiopia. We show that the re-designed programme has an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$69 per health-adjusted life year 
(HALY) compared with the standard programme. This is potentially 
cost-ineffective when compared with current estimates of health opportunity cost 
in Ethiopia. However, rural populations are typically less wealthy than urban 
populations and experience poorer lifetime health. Prioritising such populations 
can thus be seen as being equitable. We analyse the trade-off between 
cost-effectiveness and equity using the Atkinson inequality aversion parameter, 
ε, representing the decision maker's strength of concern for reducing health 
inequality. We find that the more equitable programme would be considered 
worthwhile by a decision maker whose inequality concern is greater than 
ε = 5.66, which at current levels of health inequality in Ethiopia implies that 
health gains are weighted at least 3.86 times more highly in the poorest 
compared with the richest wealth quintile group. We explore the sensitivity of 
this conclusion to a range of assumptions and cost-per-HALY threshold values, to 
illustrate how DCEA can inform the thinking of decision makers and stakeholders 
about health equity trade-offs.

BACKGROUND: Systemic treatment for advanced cancer offers uncertain and 
sometimes little benefit while the burden can be high. Hence, treatment 
decisions require Shared Decision Making (SDM). The CHOICE trial examines the 
separate and combined effect of oncologist training and a patient communication 
aid on SDM in consultations about palliative systemic treatment.
METHODS: A RCT design with four parallel arms will be adopted. Patients with 
metastatic or irresectable cancer with a median life expectancy <12 months who 
meet with a medical oncologist to discuss the start or continuation of 
palliative systemic treatment are eligible. A total of 24 oncologists (in 
training) and 192 patients will be recruited. The oncologist training consists 
of a reader, two group sessions (3.5 h; including modelling videos and role 
play), a booster feedback session (1 h) and a consultation room tool. The 
patient communication aid consists of a home-sent question prompt list and a 
value clarification exercise to prepare patients for SDM in the consultation. 
The control condition consists of care as usual. The primary outcome is observed 
SDM in audio-recorded consultations. Secondary outcomes include patient and 
oncologist evaluation of communication and decision-making, the decision made, 
quality of life, potential adverse outcomes such as anxiety and hopelessness, 
and consultation duration. Patients fill out questionnaires at baseline (T0), 
before (T1) and after the consultation (T2) and at 3 and 6 months (T3 and T4). 
All oncologists participate in two standardized patient assessments 
(before-after training) prior to the start of patient inclusion. They will fill 
out a questionnaire before and after these assessments, as well as after each of 
the recorded consultations in clinical practice.
DISCUSSION: The CHOICE trial will enable evidence-based choices regarding the 
investment in SDM interventions targeting either oncologists, patients or both 
in the advanced cancer setting. The trial takes into account the immediate 
effect of the interventions on observed communication, but also on more distal 
and potential adverse patient outcomes. Also, the trial provides evidence 
regarding the assumption that SDM about palliative cancer treatment results in 
less aggressive treatment and more quality of life in the final period of life.

It has been 50 years since the dust mite was first appreciated to be a major 
source of allergen in house dust, and by extension a key trigger of allergic 
respiratory disease. Since that time a number of protein allergens have been 
identified and characterized, mainly from mite feces, and standardized mite 
extracts and IgE assays have been developed. Insights into the lifecycle of dust 
mites and aspects of mite allergen biology have shed light on the mechanisms 
that lead to respiratory disease and to the development of interventions that 
can minimize dust mite allergen exposure. It is now clear that dust mite allergy 
is a key contributor to asthma in many parts of the world, and that long-term 
avoidance can be effective for preventing sensitization and minimizing the 
development and severity of respiratory disease. Here, we discuss the evidence 
linking dust mites with respiratory disease, outline studies that support the 
efficacy of home environmental interventions, and highlight practical methods 
that have been shown to be effective as part of a multifaceted approach to dust 
mite avoidance.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disease in 
Caucasians, affecting around 10,000 individuals in the UK today. Prognosis has 
improved considerably over recent decades with ongoing improvements in treatment 
and care. Providing up-to-date survival predictions is important for patients, 
clinicians and health services planning.
METHODS: Flexible parametric survival modelling of UK CF Registry data from 2011 
to 2015, capturing 602 deaths in 10,428 individuals. Survival curves were 
estimated from birth; conditional on reaching older ages; and projected under 
different assumptions concerning future mortality trends, using baseline 
characteristics of sex, CFTR genotype (zero, one, two copies of F508del) and age 
at diagnosis.
FINDINGS: Male sex was associated with better survival, as was older age at 
diagnosis, but only in F508del non-homozygotes. Survival did not differ by 
genotype among individuals diagnosed at birth. Median survival ages at birth in 
F508del homozygotes were 46years (males) and 41years (females), and similar in 
non-homozygotes diagnosed at birth. F508del heterozygotes diagnosed aged 5 had 
median survival ages of 57 (males) and 51 (females). Conditional on survival to 
30, median survival age rises to 52 (males) and 49 (females) in homozygotes. 
Mortality rates decreased annually by 2% during 2006-2015. Future improvements 
at this rate suggest median survival ages for F508del homozygous babies of 65 
(males) and 56 (females).
INTERPRETATION: Over half of babies born today, and of individuals aged 30 and 
above today, can expect to survive into at least their fifth decade.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study We searched PubMed with terms 
"(cystic fibrosis survival) and (projection OR model OR registry OR United 
Kingdom OR UK)" to identify relevant studies on survival estimates for 
individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). We also considered the most recent annual 
report from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry (Cystic Fibrosis Trust, 2016), a 
review by Buzzetti and colleagues (2009), the chapter on Epidemiology of Cystic 
Fibrosis by MacNeill (2016), the study of MacKenzie and colleagues (2014), and 
references therein. There have been many studies of factors associated with 
survival in CF; most have focused on identifying risk factors, and only a few 
have presented estimated survival curves, which are the focus of this work. The 
most recent study of survival in the UK is by Dodge and colleagues (2007), who 
used data obtained from CF clinics and the national death register, and gave an 
estimate of survival for babies born in 2003. We found no previous studies that 
have obtained detailed information on survival using UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry 
data. Jackson and colleagues obtained survival estimates for the US and Ireland 
using registry data (Jackson et al., 2011). MacKenzie and colleagues used US 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry data from 2000 to 2010 to project 
survival for children born and diagnosed with CF in 2010, accounting for sex, 
genotype and age at diagnosis (MacKenzie et al., 2014). Previous studies on 
estimated survival in CF have become out of date or have not accounted for the 
full range of patient characteristics available at birth. Few have presented 
conditional survival estimates (Dodge et al., 2007). Added value of this study 
This is the first study to yield detailed survival statistics using the UK 
Cystic Fibrosis Registry, which is one of the largest national CF registries 
outside of the US and has almost complete coverage of the UK CF population. The 
primary goal was to leverage the long-term follow-up of the nearly complete UK 
CF population available in the Registry for the purposes of producing accurate, 
precise predictions in the modern era of CF care. Estimates are presented from 
birth and conditional on survival to older ages. These are the first conditional 
estimates in CF to also account for genotype, sex and age at diagnosis, which 
were each included in the modelling using a flexible approach. Projections are 
also provided under different scenarios based on downward trends in mortality 
rates. Our use of flexible parametric survival models is novel in this field, 
and our approach could be used to provide modern survival statistics for other 
chronic diseases and disorders. Implications of all the available evidence Our 
estimates of future survival in CF under a range of different scenarios are 
based on data on nearly all individuals living with the disease in the UK in 
recent times, reflective of a modern era of care, and are most appropriate for 
the families of babies being born in the present day with CF. Conditional 
estimates inform patients who have already reached an older age, and their 
clinicians. Over half of babies born today, and of individuals aged 30years and 
above alive today, can expect to survive into their fifth decade. Insights based 
on our survival projections can be used to inform future needs in CF health care 
provision.
