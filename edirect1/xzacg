In this article, currently accepted standards for cost-benefit analysis of 
health care interventions are outlined, and a framework to evaluate palliative 
care within these standards is provided. Recent publications on the economic 
implications of palliative care are reviewed, which are only the "tip of the 
iceberg" of the potential costs and benefits. Using this framework, the authors 
offer guidelines for performing comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of 
palliative care and conclude that many of the issues beneath the surface may be 
substantial and deserving of closer scrutiny. Methods for gathering relevant 
cost-benefit information are detailed, along with potential obstacles to 
implementation. This approach is applicable to palliative care in general, 
including palliative care for elders.

PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 
defibrillation training for laypersons unselected for risk of encountering cases 
of cardiac arrest is not known. We compared the costs and health benefits of 
alternative resuscitation training strategies for adults without professional 
first-responder duties who are at average risk of encountering cases of 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS: We constructed a cost-effectiveness analytic model. Data on cardiac 
arrest epidemiology and the effectiveness of CPR/defibrillation training were 
obtained from the medical literature. Instructional costs were determined from a 
survey of training programs. Downstream cardiac arrest survivor quality-adjusted 
life expectancy and long-term health care costs were derived from prior studies. 
We compared three strategies for training unselected laypersons: 
CPR/defibrillation training alone, training combined with home defibrillator 
purchase, and no training. The main outcome measures were total instructional 
costs for trainees combined with health care costs for additional cardiac arrest 
survivors, and quality-adjusted survival for additional patients resuscitated by 
trainees.
RESULTS: CPR/defibrillation training yielded 2.7 quality-adjusted hours of life 
at a cost of 62 US dollars per trainee (202,400 US dollars per quality-adjusted 
life-year [QALY] gained). Training laypersons in CPR/defibrillation with 
subsequent defibrillator purchase cost 2,489,700 US dollars per QALY. In 
contrast, CPR/defibrillation training cost less than 75,000 US dollars per QALY 
if trainees lived with persons older than 75 years or with persons who had 
cardiac disease, or if total training costs were less than 10 US dollars.
CONCLUSION: Training unselected laypersons in CPR/defibrillation is costly 
compared with other public health initiatives. Conversely, training laypersons 
selected by occupation, low training costs, or having high-risk household 
companions is substantially more efficient.

Medical Center, 759 Chestnut Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01199, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination, antiviral 
therapy, or no intervention for healthy working adults, accounting for annual 
variation in vaccine efficacy.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on published clinical 
trials of influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs, incorporating 10 years of 
surveillance data from the World Health Organization. We modeled influenza 
vaccination, treatment of influenza-like illness with antiviral drugs, or both, 
as compared with no intervention, targeting healthy working adults under age 50 
years in the general community or workplace. Outcomes included costs, illness 
days, and quality-adjusted days gained.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the majority of costs incurred for all 
strategies were related to lost productivity from influenza illness. The least 
expensive strategy varied from year to year. For the 10-year period, antiviral 
therapy without vaccination was associated with the lowest overall costs (234 US 
dollars per person per year). Annual vaccination cost was 239 US dollars per 
person, and was associated with 0.0409 quality-adjusted days saved, for a 
marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of 113 US dollars per quality-adjusted day 
gained or 41,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year saved compared with 
antiviral therapy. No intervention was the most expensive and least effective 
option. In sensitivity analyses, lower vaccination costs, higher annual 
probabilities of influenza, and higher numbers of workdays lost to influenza 
made vaccination more cost-effective than treatment. If vaccination cost was 
less than 16 US dollars or time lost from work exceeded 2.4 days per episode of 
influenza, then vaccination was cost saving compared with all other strategies.
CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination for healthy working adults is reasonable 
economically, and under certain circumstances is cost saving. Antiviral therapy 
is consistently cost saving.

Use of ultrasonic vocalizations to assess olfactory detection in mouse pups 
treated with 3-methylindole.

Altricial mammals use olfaction long before the olfactory bulb has reached its 
anatomically mature state. Indeed, while audition and vision are still not 
functional, the olfactory system of newborn animals can clearly process distinct 
odorant molecules. Although several previous studies have emphasized the 
important role that olfaction plays in early critical functions, it has been 
difficult to develop a sensitive and reliable test to precisely quantify 
olfactory ability in pups. One difficulty in determining early sensory 
capabilities is the rather limited behavioral repertory of neonates. The present 
study examines the use of ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by isolated rodent 
pups as a potential index of odor detection in newborn mice. As early as 
postnatal day 2, mice reliably decrease their emission of ultrasonic calls in 
response to odor exposure to the bedding of adult male mice but not in response 
to clean bedding odors or to non-social odorant molecules. A toxin known to 
damage the olfactory epithelium in adult, the 3-methylindole, impairs the 
ultrasonic call responses triggered by exposure to male bedding, thus confirming 
the efficiency of this olfactotoxin on mice pups. The administration of 
3-methylindole severely reduced the life expectancy of the majority of subjects. 
This result is discussed according to the critical role of olfaction in 
nipple-seeking behavior in mouse pups.

myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase.

BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate is a targeted therapy for the treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-utility of 
imatinib mesylate compared with hydroxyurea in patients with chronic-phase CML 
for whom first-line treatment with interferon-alpha failed to produce a 
response.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression for 
hypothetical patients receiving imatinib mesylate or hydroxyurea, who had not 
previously responded to interferon-a therapy, to determine outcomes in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were estimated from the perspective 
of the United Kingdom National Health Service. Patient data were derived from 
previously published trials.
RESULTS: The Markov model simulated the transitions of a hypothetical sample of 
1000 chronic-phase CML patients using 1 monthly cycle over the lifetime of the 
patient sample. Median survival rates were estimated to be 77 months for 
imatinib mesylate-treated patients and 56 months for hydroxyurea-treated 
patients. Patients receiving imatinib mesylate accrued 5.95 QALYs, whereas 
hydroxyurea-treated patients accrued 3.49 QALYs. The estimated per-patient 
lifetime costs were 110,103 pound sterlings for patients in the imatinib 
mesylate group and 15,566 pound sterlings for patients in the hydroxyurea group 
(year-2001 values). The estimated year-2001 incremental cost per QALY gained 
from using imatinib mesylate compared with hydroxyurea in chronic phase CML was 
38,468 pound sterlings.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present model analysis, imatinib mesylate as a second-line 
treatment for patients with chronic phase CML was found to offer considerable 
health benefits to patients, but at a cost to the payer. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was 38,468 pound sterlings (year-2001 values).

This study proposes an optimization model for optimal treatment of bacterial 
infections. Using an influence diagram as the knowledge and decision model, we 
can conduct two kinds of reasoning simultaneously: diagnostic reasoning and 
treatment planning. The input information of the reasoning system are 
conditional probability distributions of the network model, the costs of the 
candidate antibiotic treatments, the expected effects of the treatments, and 
extra constraints regarding belief propagation. Since the prevalence of the 
pathogens and infections are determined by many site-by-site factors, which are 
not compliant with conventional approaches for approximate reasoning, we 
introduce fuzzy information. The output results of the reasoning model are the 
likelihood of a bacterial infection, the most likely pathogen(s), the suggestion 
of optimal treatment, the gain of life expectancy for the patient related to the 
optimal treatment, the probability of coverage associated with the antibiotic 
treatment, and the cost-effect analysis of the treatment prescribed.

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for non-advanced lung cancer, but 
is encumbered with an overall relative poor long time prognosis. The purpose of 
this study was to examine if long time survival for patients operated for 
non-small cell lung cancer have changed over a 15 years period. We 
retrospectively studied hospital records of the 351 patients operated, with the 
intention to cure, for a primary non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) in our 
department between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2002. Preoperative clinical 
variables were noted together with variables allowing staging based on 
pathological examination. Absolute survival and survival relative to expected 
was studied for the whole group using uni- and multivariate Cox analyses. Early 
30 days mortality was 2.0%. The 5-year absolute and relative survivals for all 
patients were 46.3% and 52.6%, respectively. After 10 years corresponding values 
were 32.9% and 44.6%. At the end of the study, the 15-year absolute survival was 
27.8% with a relative survival of 46.2%. Univariate analysis revealed that age, 
gender, nodular stage, tumour size, p-stage, type of resection, time of 
operation and additional cardiovascular disease at the time of operation 
significantly influenced survival. Multivariate analysis for all patients 
revealed that low age, female gender, low nodular stage, and operation late in 
the study period were significant prognostic factors predicting improved 
survival. When including a population based age- and gender-adjusted median 
expected life time for every patient as a predictor for survival, only female 
gender and low nodular stage were additional significant and independent 
positive prognostic factors.

Noncommunicable disease mortality in the Russian Federation: from legislation to 
policy.

Levintova M(1), Novotny T.

mlevintova@psg.ucsf.edu

Political, social and economic transitions that occurred as a result of the 
regime change in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation from the late 1980s 
to the early 1990s led to a sudden increase in mortality across the region, with 
more than 80% of deaths being attributable to preventable causes, such as 
cardiovascular disease, lifestyle factors and injuries. The Russian Federation 
has experienced some of the most dramatic population declines in the world. 
Countrywide health reforms have been implemented, although they continue to 
ignore the impact of the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the 
Russian Federation. Improvements in mortality patterns in the Russian Federation 
are possible only with the broader engagement of organized nongovernmental 
groups within the civil society that is strongly supported by Federal 
legislation to address NCDs. We discuss the Russian Federal legislation germane 
to the prevention and control of NCDs in the light of the current mortality 
crisis and suggest possible policy responses to this crisis.

Advanced heart failure: impact on older patients and informal carers.

AIM: This paper reports a study exploring the impact of advanced heart failure 
on the lives of older patients and their informal carers.
BACKGROUND: Prognosis is poor in heart failure, with more than a third of 
patients dying within 12 months of diagnosis, and end-of-life symptoms are 
distressing and poorly controlled. Although end-of-life care for people with 
heart failure has received increased attention in recent years, there are still 
few data on the impact of advanced heart failure on the lives of patients and 
their informal carers.
METHODS: Focused interviews were conducted with 10 older people with advanced 
heart failure and their nominated informal carer identified from one district 
general hospital in the United Kingdom (UK). Joint interviews were conducted 
with patients and carers in their own home. Thematic analysis was used to 
identify themes and subthemes.
FINDINGS: Heart failure affected all aspects of the lives of patients and carers 
and, in particular, curtailed everyday activities. Patients were very concerned 
about the 'burden' their illness placed on their carer, who in all cases was 
their partner, although carers did not conceptualize the situation in this way. 
The socially isolating influence of the condition on both patients and carers 
was compounded by lack of professional input, and confusion about diagnosis was 
evident. Concerns about the future were common and, although few participants 
reported having been explicitly told about their prognosis, many made realistic 
statements about their limited life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: This older cohort of people suffering from heart failure appears to 
have needs not unlike those of patients with 'terminal diseases'. When people 
are diagnosed with more familiar terminal illnesses, in particular cancer, they 
are given ongoing explanations, reassurance and support. Similar professional 
input is needed for patients with advanced heart failure and their carers.

Discharge education improves clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart 
failure.

University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA. tkoellin@umich.edu

BACKGROUND: Although interventions combining patient education and postdischarge 
management have demonstrated benefits in patients with chronic heart failure, 
the benefit attributable to patient education alone is not known. We 
hypothesized that a patient discharge education program would improve clinical 
outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of 223 systolic 
heart failure patients and compared the effects of a 1-hour, one-on-one teaching 
session with a nurse educator to the standard discharge process. Subjects were 
contacted by telephone at 30, 90, and 180 days to collect information about 
clinical events, symptoms, and self-care practices. The primary end point of the 
study was the total number of days hospitalized or dead in the 180-day follow-up 
period. Subjects randomized to receive the teaching session (n=107) had fewer 
days hospitalized or dead in the follow-up period (0 and 10 days, median and 
75th percentiles) than did controls (n=116, 4 and 19 days; P=0.009). Patients 
receiving the education intervention had a lower risk of rehospitalization or 
death (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.93; P=0.018). 
Costs of care, including the cost of the intervention, were lower in patients 
receiving the education intervention than in control subjects by 2823 dollars 
per patient (P=0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a 1-hour, nurse educator-delivered teaching session 
at the time of hospital discharge resulted in improved clinical outcomes, 
increased self-care measure adherence, and reduced cost of care in patients with 
systolic heart failure.

    J Urol. 2005 Sep;174(3):1152-3; author reply 1153.

PURPOSE: We reviewed the curative options available to patients with local 
failure after radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer and identified the 
patients best suited for such salvage therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of English language publications was 
done using the key terms salvage, prostatectomy, cryosurgery, brachytherapy and 
radiation failure.
RESULTS: Salvage radical prostatectomy offers 5-year biochemical relapse-free 
rates between 55 and 69%. Higher complication rates are reported with salvage 
compared to primary radical prostatectomy, including rectal injuries, bladder 
neck contracture and urinary incontinence. Cryosurgery biochemical response 
rates vary according to the definition of failure but they are generally lower 
than those of salvage radical prostatectomy. The local control rates of 
cryosurgery are acceptable. Major complications related to cryotherapy are 
urinary incontinence, impotence, pelvic pain and urinary retention. Experience 
with salvage brachytherapy has been limited but some success has been reported 
in terms of biochemical control.
CONCLUSIONS: Salvage prostatectomy for localized radiation failure is a good 
option in the patient with a life expectancy of at least 10 years, preradiation 
and preoperative prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, and localized 
preoperative stage with the understanding that complication risks are higher. 
Salvage cryotherapy is a valid option in patients with preoperative prostate 
specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml and Gleason score less than 8, clinical 
stage less than T3 who are hormonally naive. Salvage cryotherapy is especially 
suited for older patients with some comorbidities who are still considered to be 
at reasonable anesthetic risk. The study of brachytherapy remains in its infancy 
and the efficacy of this modality remains to be determined.

Tegaserod is effective in the initial and retreatment of irritable bowel 
syndrome with constipation.

M√ºller-Lissner S(1), Holtmann G, Rueegg P, Weidinger G, L√∂ffler H.

Author information:
(1)Park-Klinik Weissensee, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are often cyclical and thus may 
require repeated rather than continuous therapy. Tegaserod is effective and 
well-tolerated for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation but data on 
retreatment are lacking.
AIM: To assess whether tegaserod retreatment is as efficacious and 
well-tolerated as initial treatment in a primary care setting.
METHODS: This open-label trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
tegaserod under real-life conditions. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation 
patients received tegaserod 6 mg b.d. for 12 weeks; response was assessed at 
weeks 4 and 12. Responders (those achieving satisfactory relief for at least 2 
of the previous 4 weeks) at weeks 4 and/or 12 entered an 8-week withdrawal 
period where symptom recurrence was assessed. Patients experiencing recurrence 
could receive tegaserod 6 mg b.d. for another 4 weeks (retreatment phase) and on 
completion, could choose to continue tegaserod in a 6-month extension study.
RESULTS: A total of 513 patients received initial treatment with tegaserod; 
85.0% (436 of 513) responded. 403 responders entered the withdrawal period; 
symptoms recurred in 83.9% (338 of 403) after a mean of 38 days. Of the 307 
patients who subsequently entered retreatment 89.3% (274 of 307) responded. 
Among patients entering the retreatment period, 269 (87.6%) had responded within 
the first 4 weeks of initial treatment. Of these, 243 (90.3%) responded to 
tegaserod retreatment. Adverse events were infrequent and similar during 4 weeks 
of the initial treatment period (11.1%) and on retreatment (10.4%). The 
extension study, completed by 188 of 232 (81.0%) patients, demonstrated good 
long-term tolerability of tegaserod.
CONCLUSIONS: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation patients can be 
successfully treated, and retreated, with tegaserod 6 mg b.d. Tegaserod was 
well-tolerated during initial and retreatment periods.

AIMS: Production of a nisin-containing cellophane-based coating to be used in 
the packaging of chopped meat.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The adsorption of nisin to cellophane 'P' type surface was 
studied at 8, 25, 40 and 60 degrees C using different concentrations of nisin. 
Then, the antimicrobial activity of adsorbed nisin to cellophane surface was 
determined in fresh veal meat for effectiveness in reducing the total aerobic 
bacteria. The adsorption of nisin to cellophane was higher at 8 degrees C. The 
developed bioactive cellophane reduced significantly the growth of the total 
aerobic bacteria (by ca 1.5 log units) through 12 days of storage at 4 degrees 
C.
CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive cellophane packaging could be used for controlling the 
microbial growth in chopped meat.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Nisin-adsorbed bioactive cellophane would 
result in an extension of the shelf life of chopped meat under refrigeration 
temperatures.

Cost-effectiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in patients with 
hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis.

California, 513 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94143-0538, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: HCV-related cirrhosis is a leading risk factor for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Surveillance might detect HCC at a treatable 
stage. We estimated the clinical and economic consequences of a common HCC 
surveillance strategy in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis in the context of 
alternative HCC treatment strategies.
METHODS: With a Markov model, we examined surveillance with serum 
alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound every 6 months in patients with compensated 
HCV-related cirrhosis from age 45-70 years or death, and HCC treatment with 
resection, cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT), or living donor liver 
transplantation (LDLT).
RESULTS: Compared to natural history in the base case, surveillance with 
resection, listing for CLT, or LDLT increased life expectancy by 0.49, 2.58, and 
3.81 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively, all at costs less than 
51,000 US dollars/QALY gained. The consequences of surveillance were most 
sensitive to the outcomes and costs of HCC treatments but not surveillance test 
performance characteristics or cost. Prioritizing CLT for patients with HCC over 
those with decompensated cirrhosis resulted in greater overall life expectancy 
with minimal increase in cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance for HCC in patients with compensated HCV-related 
cirrhosis might gain QALYs at acceptable costs. The impact of surveillance 
depends most on the outcomes and costs of HCC treatments, rather than 
surveillance test characteristics. By increasing organ availability for timely 
definitive treatment, LDLT might achieve the greatest gain in life expectancy at

benefits of CLT.

Enamel and dentine development and the life history profile of Victoriapithecus 
macinnesi from Maboko Island, Kenya.

Two permanent lower second molar teeth (KNM-MB 19841 and KNM-MB 27844) 
attributed to Victoriapithecus macinnesi were prepared for histological 
analysis. A further five male and three female canine teeth were replicated with 
a silicone impression material and perikymata counts subsequently made on epoxy 
casts over the whole crown surface. Daily enamel cross striations averaged 6 
microm apart in both cuspal and lateral enamel of the molars and the total crown 
formation times were approximately 1.24 years in the molars and, using the same 
periodicity determined from the molars, 1.84 and 1.36 years respectively in the 
male and female canines. Rates of dentine formation matched those known for 
extant macaques and were used to calculate root extension rates, which averaged 
11.5 microm per day over the whole 8 mm root length of KNM-MB 19841. The period 
between M2 initiation and gingival emergence was estimated to be approximately 
1.95 years in Victoriapithecus which is greater than estimates for Cebus 
albifrons and Chlorocebus aethiops, (which are similar in body mass to 
Victoriapithecus), but less than estimates made here for several macaque 
species. A speculative picture of dental development in Victoriapithecus emerges 
that is slower than that known for modern vervet monkeys and may have been more 
similar to that in some smaller modern macaque species.

Demographic developments indicate both an increasing proportion of the elderly 
in the population and an augmenting life expectancy. The elderly tend to retain 
their natural teeth for longer, and the first removable denture is inserted more 
often later in life. Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is influenced 
by functional parameters such as pain and discomfort, but also by psychological 
and social aspects. Dental care may restore oral function and alleviate pain and 
discomfort, e.g. caused by xerostomia. Dental treatment could further improve 
oral appearance of the elderly individual, which might provide self-esteem and 
thus contribute to the psychological well-being. Even social aspects like 
communication and social interactions could be positively influenced by dental 
care. Thus oral health and dental care have a significant impact on the quality 
of life (QoL) of elderly adults.

The objectives of this report are to review the assessment of patient-focused 
outcomes in pediatric orthopedic surgery, to describe a framework for 
identifying appropriate sets of measures, and to illustrate an application of 
the framework to a challenging orthopedic problem.A detailed framework of study 
design and measurement factors is described. The factors are important for 
selecting appropriate instruments to measure health status and health-related 
quality of life (HRQL) in a particular context. A study to evaluate treatment 
alternatives for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and congenital tibial 
dysplasia (NF1-CTD) provides a rich illustration of the application of the 
framework. The application involves great variability in the instrument 
selection factors. Furthermore, these patients and their supportive caregivers 
face numerous complex health challenges with long-term implications for HRQL. 
Detailed summaries of important generic preference-based multi-attribute 
measurement systems, pediatric health profile instruments, and pediatric 
orthopedic-specific instruments are presented. Age-appropriate generic and 
specific measures are identified for study of NF1-CTD patients. Selected 
measures include the Activities Scale for Children, Gillette Functional 
Assessment Questionnaire Walking Scale, Health Utilities Index, and Pediatric 
Inventory of Quality of Life. Reliable and valid measures for application to 
pediatric orthopedics are available. There are important differences among 
measures. The selected measures complement each other. The framework in this 
report provides a guide for selecting appropriate measures. Application of 
appropriate sets of measures will enhance the ability to describe the morbidity 
of pediatric orthopedic patients and to assess the effectiveness of alternative 
clinical interventions. The framework for measurement of health status and HRQL 
from a patient perspective has relevance to many other areas of orthopedic 
practice.

Immortalization of human fetal cells: the life span of umbilical cord 
blood-derived cells can be prolonged without manipulating p16INK4a/RB braking 
pathway.

Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCBMSCs) are expected 
to serve as an excellent alternative to bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal 
stem cells. However, it is difficult to study them because of their limited life 
span. To overcome this problem, we attempted to produce a strain of UCBMSCs with 
a long life span and to investigate whether the strain could maintain phenotypes 
in vitro. UCBMSCs were infected with retrovirus carrying the human telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to prolong their life span. The UCBMSCs underwent 
30 population doublings (PDs) and stopped dividing at PD 37. The UCBMSCs newly 
established with hTERT (UCBTERTs) proliferated for >120 PDs. The p16INK4a/RB 
braking pathway leading to senescence can be inhibited by introduction of Bmi-1, 
a polycomb-group gene, and human papillomavirus type 16 E7, but the extension of 
the life span of the UCBMSCs with hTERT did not require inhibition of the 
p16INK4a/RB pathway. The characteristics of the UCBTERTs remained unchanged 
during the prolongation of life span. UCBTERTs provide a powerful model for 
further study of cellular senescence and for future application to cell-based 
therapy by using umbilical cord blood cells.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the range and activity of the clinical and biological 
features of patients aged <40 with Paget's disease of bone.
METHODS: A retrospective two centre study of 314 patients with Paget's disease 
of bone from two university hospitals. The disease was diagnosed by 
radiological, serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels, or clinical features, and 
bone scintigraphy in most patients. Demographic data, reason for diagnosis, 
bones affected, disease extent using Coutris' index, complications during 
progression, and disease activity using Renier's index were assessed. Patients 
over and under 40 were compared.
RESULTS: 18/314 (5.7%) patients were diagnosed before the age of 40; median (SD) 
age was 35.4 (5.5) (range 18-40) and AP 555.6 (566.3) IU/l (range 70-1949). 
Coutris' extension index was 12.8 (10.5) and Renier's activity index 35.9 
(31.9). Younger patients had more affected bones (p<0.05) than those aged >40, 
higher level of extension (p<0.05), higher AP value (p = 0.05), and greater 
incidence of thoracolumbar spine disease. Disease activity did not differ 
significantly between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Paget's disease diagnosed before the age of 40 is more extensive 
but not more active, with higher AP values than in those diagnosed after age 40.

Screening for cancer: are resources being used wisely?

Cancer screening is commonly offered in order to detect tumors at an early, 
treatable stage. These efforts are highly advocated and widely accepted by the 
general public. However, there is conflicting evidence about the benefits of 
screening for breast cancer in pre-menopausal women, prostate cancer in older 
men, and colorectal cancer for both sexes. This paper examines cancer screening 
in relation to a disease reservoir hypothesis. There is a reservoir of 
undetected disease that can be found with more aggressive screening. However, 
much of the disease that is detected may be classified as pseudodisease because 
it will have no effect of life expectancy or health-related quality of life. 
Pseudodisease is defined as detectable disease that will never be clinically 
significant. A second concern about screening is that randomized clinical trials 
often show benefits of cancer screening for disease-specific endpoints but no 
benefit for total mortality. Further, screening for some cancers may 
significantly increase healthcare costs without enhancing population health 
status. Improvements in biomarkers and in screening methodologies will 
significantly increase the number of cancers detected. Future research is 
necessary in order to determine which population-based screening programs are 
the best use of public health resources.

Geographical variation in life expectancy at birth in England and Wales is 
largely explained by deprivation.

Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK. laura.woods@lshtm.ac.uk

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the population mortality profile of England and 
Wales by deprivation and in each government office region (GOR) during 1998, and 
to quantify the influence of geography and deprivation in determining life 
expectancy.
DESIGN: Construction of life tables describing age specific mortality rates and 
life expectancy at birth from death registrations and estimated population 
counts. Life tables were created for (a) quintiles of income deprivation based 
on the income domain score of the index of multiple deprivation 2000, (b) each 
GOR and Wales, and (c) every combination of deprivation and geography.
SETTING: England and Wales.PATIENTS/ PARTICIPANTS: Residents of England and 
Wales, 1998.
MAIN RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth varies with deprivation quintile and is 
highest in the most affluent groups. The differences are mainly attributable to 
differences in mortality rates under 75 years of age. Regional life expectancies 
display a clear north-south gradient. Linear regression analysis shows that 
deprivation explains most of the geographical variation in life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Geographical patterns of life expectancy identified within these 
data for England and Wales in 1998 are mainly attributable to variations in 
deprivation status as defined by the IMD 2000 income domain score.

Has the relation between income inequality and life expectancy disappeared? 
Evidence from Italy and top industrialised countries.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between income inequality and life 
expectancy in Italy and across wealthy nations.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Measure correlation between income inequality and life 
expectancy at birth within Italy and across the top 21 wealthy countries. 
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to study these relations. 
Multivariate linear regression was used to measure the association between 
income inequality and life expectancy at birth adjusting for per capita income, 
education, and/or per capita gross domestic product.
DATA SOURCES: Data on the Gini coefficient (income inequality), life expectancy 
at birth, per capita income, and educational attainment for Italy came from the 
surveys on Italian household on income and wealth 1995-2000 and the National 
Institute of Statistics information system. Data for industrialised nations were 
taken from the United Nations Development Program's human development indicators 
database 2003.
RESULTS: In Italy, income inequality (beta = -0.433; p<0.001) and educational 
attainment (beta = 0.306; p<0.001) were independently associated with life 
expectancy, but per capita income was not (beta = 0.121; p>0.05). In cross 
national analyses, income inequality had a strong negative correlation with life 
expectancy at birth (r = -0.864; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, a country where health care and education are universally 
available, and with a strong social safety net, income inequality had an 
independent and more powerful effect on life expectancy at birth than did per 
capita income and educational attainment. Italy had a moderately high degree of 
income inequality and an average life expectancy compared with other wealthy 
countries. The cross national analyses showed that the relation between income 
inequality and population health has not disappeared.

route of reconstruction.

Duodenogastric reflux (DGR) is a common sequel of subtotal esophagectomy and 
gastric pull-up, and it may contribute to mucosal changes of both the gastric 
conduit and the esophageal remnant. This study investigated the effect of the 
route of reconstruction on the DGR. 24-hour ambulatory bilirubin monitoring was 
performed on patients who underwent transhiatal subtotal esophagectomy and a 
gastric tube interposition either in the posterior mediastinum (PM group, n = 
11), or in the retrosternal space (RS group, n = 8): A Control group of 8 
healthy volunteers was also studied. The median percentage of reflux time, the 
median number of reflux episodes, and the median number of reflux episodes 
longer than 5 minutes, in PM versus RS groups, were 29.1% versus 0.15% (p < 
0.001), 185 versus 8 (p = 0.002) and 10 versus 0 (p = 0.001), respectively. The 
values of the above variables in PM versus control groups were 29.1% versus 
3.95% (p = 0.007), 185 versus 21 (p = 0.02), and 10 versus 2 (p = 0.009), 
respectively, whereas in RS versus control groups they were 0.15% versus 3.95% 
(p = 0.01), 8 versus 21 (p = 0.04), and 0 versus 2 (p = 0.05), respectively. 
Posterior mediastinal gastric interposition is associated with high reflux of 
duodenal contents, whereas retrosternal interposition minimizes the reflux at 
levels even lower than those of the healthy individuals. The latter type of 
reconstruction may be a good alternative from that perspective, especially in 
patients with long life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: To report the protracted 9-year survival of a patient after surgical 
management of multiple liver metastases from uveal melanoma.
DESIGN: Interventional case report.
METHODS: A 30-year-old patient, treated for choroidal melanoma by proton beam 
therapy, was semiannually followed by abdominal ultrasonography. Two years after 
initial treatment, a total body computed tomography scan suggested the diagnosis 
of isolated liver metastases.
RESULTS: Multiple wedge resections and postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy 
with fotemustine were performed. After 4 years, a metastatic nodule in the head 
of the pancreas was detected and surgically removed. Eighteen months later, 
metastases were progressively detected in other organs. The patient finally died 
of carcinomatous meningitis 9 years of first treatment of metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, the surgical control of liver metastases 
associated with intra-arterial chemotherapy prolonged the quality and length of 
life with progressive disease extension to other organs.

Number of patients with chronic heart failure is increasing in all developed 
countries. The reasons are both, the improving prevention and treatment of 
deadly cardiovascular diseases, like acute myocardial infarction or stroke, and 
the increasing life expectancy. The cardiovascular mortality has declined by 30% 
and the average life expectancy has increased by 4 years also in the Czech 
Republic during the last 15 years. The prevalence of heart failure is about 1.5% 
in a general population, which means that there is about 150,000 patients in the 
Czech Republic. The annual incidence is about 0.4%, which means that there is 
about 40,000 new patients in the Czech Republic every year. The prevalence is 
increasing with age significantly. With respect to the ageing of the population 
it is expected that number of heart failure patients will be increasing. Based 
on the results of big clinical trials the treatment of heart failure has changed 
significantly. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers became the first choice 
treatment improving not only symptoms but also mortality. In spite of all the 
progress in pharmacotherapy the prognosis of heart failure is still bad. Over 
40% of patients will die within 4 years after making the diagnosis of heart 
failure and one-year mortality of patients with advanced heart failure (NYHA 
class IV) is over 50%. Therefore, a research of new therapeutic possibilities is 
still continuing. At present, a clinical significance of different devices, like 
biventricular cardiac pacemakers (cardiac resynchronization therapy) or 
implantable cardioverter/defibrillators in heart failure treatment is studied. A 
gene and cell therapy represents a great hope for heart failure treatment in 
future.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive disease characterized by an 
increase in prostatic volume. The resulting urinary irritative and/or 
obstructive symptoms, when present, often reduce the patient's quality of life. 
Prostatic dihydrotestosterone, the androgen produced following transformation of 
testosterone by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, is responsible for these changes. 
Among various products used for drug therapy, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors play 
a specific role in the long-term management of BPH. Between the two currently 
available products, dutasteride is the only dual 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor 
(types 1 and 2). The efficacy of dutasteride was tested in several scientific 
studies and the cumulative results of three controlled, double-blind pivotal 
studies, showed at 2-year a clear improvement in all parameters modified during 
this disorder. A significant decrease in the severity and frequency of the 
urinary symptoms, in prostate volume, the risk of urine retention, the necessity 
to resort to surgery and an increase in peak urinary flow were observed with 
dutasteride. These results were confirmed in the 4-year-open label extension of 
these pivot studies both for tolerability of the product and the maintenance of
