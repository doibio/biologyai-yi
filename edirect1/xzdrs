BACKGROUND: Interventions targeting the same disease but at different points 
along the disease continuum (e.g., screening and vaccination to prevent cervical 
cancer [CC]) are often evaluated in isolation, which can affect 
cost-effectiveness profiles and policy conclusions. We evaluated nonavalent 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) compared with bivalent HPV vaccine 
(2vHPV) alongside deintensified screening intervals for a vaccinated birth 
cohort to inform a single optimal integrated CC prevention policy.
METHODS: Using a multimodeling approach, we evaluated the health and economic 
impacts of alternative CC screening strategies for a Norwegian birth cohort 
eligible for HPV vaccination in 2021 assuming they received 1) 2vHPV or 2) 
9vHPV. We conducted 1) a restricted analysis that evaluated the optimal HPV 
vaccine under current screening guidelines; and 2) a comprehensive analysis 
including alternative screening and vaccination strategy combinations. We 
calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and evaluated them 
according to different cost-effectiveness thresholds.
RESULTS: Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of $40,000 per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained, we found that, while holding screening intensity fixed, 
switching the routine vaccination program in Norway from 2vHPV to 9vHPV would 
not be considered cost-effective (ICER of $132,700 per QALY gained). However, 
when allowing for varying intensities of CC screening, we found that switching 
to 9vHPV would be cost-effective compared with 2vHPV under an alternative 
threshold of $55,000 per QALY gained, if coupled with reductions in the number 
of lifetime screens.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis highlights the importance of evaluating the full 
potential policy landscape for country-level decision makers considering policy 
adoption, including nonindependent primary and secondary prevention efforts, to 
draw appropriate conclusions and avoid sub-optimal outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: Without evaluating the full potential policy landscape, including 
primary and secondary prevention efforts, country-level decision makers may not 
be able to draw appropriate policy conclusions, resulting in suboptimal 
outcomes.An applied example from cervical cancer prevention in Norway compared a 
restricted analysis of current screening guidelines to a comprehensive analysis 
including alternative screening and vaccination strategy combinations.We found 
that a switch from bivalent to nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine would be 
considered cost-effective in Norway if coupled with reductions in the number of 
lifetime screens compared with the current screening strategy.A comprehensive 
analysis that considers how different types of interventions along the disease 
continuum affect each other will be critical for decision makers interpreting 
cost-effectiveness analysis results.

INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation and heart failure frequently co-exist and the 
combination is associated with a worse prognosis than either condition alone. A 
number of pharmacological agents and invasive procedures have been shown to 
benefit this complex patient group.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we compare different therapeutic approaches to atrial 
fibrillation and heart failure, including pharmacotherapy, left atrial catheter 
ablation and pace-and-ablate.
EXPERT OPINION: Left atrial catheter ablation is an efficacious option for 
restoring sinus rhythm and is most likely to provide benefit to those in whom 
durable sinus rhythm can be expected, and whose life expectancy is not 
significantly reduced by other pathologies or advanced age. A pace-and-ablate 
approach, particularly with physiological pacing, may provide more benefit to 
those with low chance of maintaining sinus rhythm. Both invasive options 
generally outperform pharmacotherapy, although it is important to individualize 
the approach for each patient through shared decision-making.

Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder. Despite the 
improved treatment in recent years with the advent of replacement therapies, the 
progression of atherosclerosis is not slowed down after the reduction of 
clotting factors in hemophilia. As life expectancy increases, more hemophilia 
patients will suffer from age-related cardiovascular diseases. Since cardiac 
surgery needs heparinization and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), it is extremely 
challenging to balance hemostasis and coagulation in patients with hemophilia. 
Here we report three cases of hemophilia patients who underwent cardiac surgery 
successfully.

The incidence of endometrial cancer continues to increase worldwide with growing 
life expectancy and rates of obesity. While endometrial cancer is primarily a 
surgical disease managed with hysterectomy, a small proportion of patients are 
deemed to be poor surgical candidates due to their co-morbidities. These 
medically inoperable patients should be considered for curative treatment with 
definitive radiation therapy, and brachytherapy is an integral component of 
their care. Referral to a high-volume center early on in the care of potentially 
inoperable patients is crucial to optimize their management. These patients 
should be evaluated by a high-risk surgical and anesthesia team to confirm their 
medical inoperability. For inoperable patients, use of image-guided 
brachytherapy is encouraged. Brachytherapy applicator selection is determined 
based on a patient's anatomy, uterine size, and extent of tumor. Advances in 
anatomic and functional imaging including multiparametric magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) have improved clinical staging of these patients and have also 
allowed for the delivery of three-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy with 
improved accuracy. With recent consensus guidelines to guide local computed 
tomography and/or MRI volume-based delineation of targets and organs-at-risk, 
local outcomes have improved and treatments are delivered with less acute and 
late morbidity. Ongoing trials are looking at novel systemic agents, such as 
immunotherapy, to induce a systemic anti-tumor immune response and improve 
outcomes in these patients.

therapy.

Pelvic radiotherapy is an essential component of cancer therapy for patients 
with cervical and other gynecological malignancies. The ovaries are particularly 
radiosensitive, and even low radiotherapy doses may result in impaired or 
complete loss of ovarian function, causing hormonal disturbances and 
infertility. Recent advances in both surgery and radiotherapy have facilitated 
the ability of some patients to maintain ovarian function through ovarian 
transposition and careful radiotherapy planning. Multidisciplinary discussions 
should be undertaken to consider which candidates are appropriate for 
transposition. Generally, patients under age 35 should be considered due to 
ovarian reserve, likelihood of oophoropexy success, and radioresistance of 
ovaries. Those patients with small squamous cell tumors, minimal extra-uterine 
extension, and no lymphovascular invasion or lymph node involvement are ideal 
candidates to minimize risk of ovarian metastasis. Patients should be assessed 
and counseled about the risks of ovarian metastasis and the likelihood of 
successful ovarian preservation before undergoing oophoropexy and starting 
treatment. Oophoropexy should be bilateral if possible, and ovaries should be 
placed superior and lateral to the radiotherapy field. Studies limiting the mean 
ovarian dose to less than 2-3 Gray have demonstrated excellent preservation of 
ovarian function. Intensity modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc 
therapy techniques have the potential to further minimize the dose to the ovary 
with excellent outcomes. The addition of brachytherapy to the treatment regimen 
will probably cause minimal risk to transposed ovaries. Oophoropexy before 
radiotherapy may preserve the hormonal function of ovaries for a duration, and 
fertility might be possible through surrogate pregnancy. Successful ovarian 
transposition has the potential to improve the overall health and wellbeing, 
reproductive options, and potentially quality of life in patients with cervical 
and other gynecological cancers.

suicide over the life course.

U.S. suicide rates are at a thirty-year high while physical health, as measured 
by life expectancy and pain, has declined, particularly for those without a 
college degree. We investigate how these patterns may be related by exploring 
the role of physical health problems in suicide deaths using 2019 data from the 
National Violent Death Reporting System. We estimate multilevel logistic 
regression models to examine (1) how individual risk factors are associated with 
the likelihood of a physical health circumstance underlying a suicide over the 
life course and (2) how context - the socioeconomic, health and policy 
environment of the state in which a decedent resides - may play a role. Physical 
health circumstances were present in about 20% of all suicides and in over half 
of suicide deaths for the older population in 2019. A gender crossover effect 
exists, in which women are more likely to have a physical health problem 
contribute to a suicide prior to age 60, but men surpass women after age 60 in 
that probability. Net of individual characteristics, we find significant 
variation across states in the likelihood of physical health circumstances. For 
all age groups, physical health circumstances are more likely in states that are 
less densely populated with weaker gun control laws and higher suicide rates. 
Among decedents younger than 65, the likelihood is elevated in states with 
limited health care access. This study highlights the critical interaction 
between physical and mental well-being, the ways in which that interaction may 
be experienced differently by gender, and the important role of social safety 
nets in prevention.

Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare neurodegenerative genetic disorder due to 
bi-allelic mutations in the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene. The aim of 
this paper is to better define the immunological profile over time, the clinical 
immune-related manifestations at diagnosis and during follow-up, and to attempt 
a genotype-phenotype correlation of an Italian cohort of AT patients. 
Retrospective data of 69 AT patients diagnosed between December 1984 and 
November 2019 were collected from the database of the Italian Primary 
Immunodeficiency Network. Patients were classified at diagnosis as lymphopenic 
(Group A) or non-lymphopenic (Group B). Fifty eight out of 69 AT patients (84%) 
were genetically characterized and distinguished according to the type of 
mutations in truncating/truncating (TT; 27 patients), non-truncating (NT)/T (28 
patients), and NT/NT (5 patients). In 3 patients, only one mutation was 
detected. Data on age at onset and at diagnosis, cellular and humoral 
compartment at diagnosis and follow-up, infectious diseases, signs of immune 
dysregulation, cancer, and survival were analyzed and compared to the genotype. 
Lymphopenia at diagnosis was related per se to earlier age at onset. Progressive 
reduction of cellular compartment occurred during the follow-up with a gradual 
reduction of T and B cell number. Most patients of Group A carried bi-allelic 
truncating mutations, had a more severe B cell lymphopenia, and a reduced life 
expectancy. A trend to higher frequency of interstitial lung disease, immune 
dysregulation, and malignancy was noted in Group B patients. Lymphopenia at the 
onset and the T/T genotype are associated with a worst clinical course. Several 
mechanisms may underlie the premature and progressive immune decline in AT 
subjects.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood cancer represent a growing population with a 
long life expectancy but high risks of treatment-induced morbidity and premature 
mortality. Regular physical activity (PA) may improve their long-term health; 
however, high-quality empirical knowledge is sparse.
OBJECTIVE: The Physical Activity and Fitness in Childhood Cancer Survivors 
(PACCS) study comprises 4 work packages (WPs) aiming for the objective 
determination of PA and self-reported health behavior, fatigue, and quality of 
life (WP 1); physical fitness determination (WP 2); the evaluation of barriers 
to and facilitators of PA (WP 1 and 3); and the feasibility testing of an 
intervention to increase PA and physical fitness (WP 4).
METHODS: The PACCS study will use a mixed methods design, combining 
patient-reported outcome measures and objective clinical and physiological 
assessments with qualitative data gathering methods. A total of 500 survivors of 
childhood cancer aged 9 to 18 years with ≥1 year after treatment completion will 
be recruited in follow-up care clinics in Norway, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and 
Switzerland. All participants will participate in WP 1, of which approximately 
150, 40, and 30 will be recruited to WP 2, WP3, and WP 4, respectively. The 
reference material for WP 1 is available from existing studies, whereas WP 2 
will recruit healthy controls. PA levels will be measured using ActiGraph 
accelerometers and self-reports. Validated questionnaires will be used to assess 
health behaviors, fatigue, and quality of life. Physical fitness will be 
measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test, isometric muscle strength tests, 
and muscle power and endurance tests. Limiting factors will be identified via 
neurological, pulmonary, and cardiac evaluations and the assessment of body 
composition and muscle size. Semistructured, qualitative interviews, analyzed 
using systematic text condensation, will identify the perceived barriers to and 
facilitators of PA for survivors of childhood cancer. In WP 4, we will evaluate 
the feasibility of a 6-month personalized PA intervention with the involvement 
of local structures.
RESULTS: Ethical approvals have been secured at all participating sites 
(Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics [2016/953 and 
2018/739]; the Oslo University Hospital Data Protection Officer; equivalent 
institutions in Finland, Denmark [file H-19032270], Germany, and Switzerland 
[Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland, project ID: 
2019-00410]). Data collection for WP 1 to 3 is complete. This will be completed 
by July 2022 for WP 4. Several publications are already in preparation, and 2 
have been published.
CONCLUSIONS: The PACCS study will generate high-quality knowledge that will 
contribute to the development of an evidence-based PA intervention for young 
survivors of childhood cancer to improve their long-term care and health. We 
will identify physiological, psychological, and social barriers to PA that can 
be targeted in interventions with immediate benefits for young survivors of 
childhood cancer in need of rehabilitation.

Life expectancy is growing especially in developed countries. In this regard, 
aging-associated diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are more common. 
Multi interconnected pathological factors involved in AD demand multi-target 
therapeutics. AChE, as a well-known target in AD, decreases the acetylcholine 
(ACh) in cholinergic synapse and, besides, increases the rate of amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) aggregation. To block the destructive effects of AChE on cholinergic 
neurons in AD, we designed a peptidic inhibitor of the peripheral anionic site 
(PAS). The PAS plays a crucial role to attract and direct the ACh to the enzyme 
active site and increase the rate of Aβ aggregation by changing the folding 
state. We utilized the template-based approach in combination with molecular 
docking, molecular dynamic simulation, and data mining to design a peptide 
library. Scoring was performed according to binding energy and the interaction 
profile of AChE inhibitors. The best candidate (p8, RMLRTTRY) was synthesized 
using solid-phase peptide synthesis, purified by RP-HPLC, and identified by 
ESI-MS. The inhibitory effect of p8 on AChE was 102.2 ± 15.2 μM. The kinetic and 
molecular modeling studies indicated the mixed inhibition mechanism for p8. The 
Arg residues in p8 had an essential role in binding to PAS.

INTRODUCTION: SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors are among the preferred 
options in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without established 
cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin 
versus DPP-4 inhibitors as a complement to metformin in the treatment ofT2D, 
from the perspective of the Colombian health system.
METHODS: The Cardiff model was used to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of dapagliflozin plus metformin compared to 
DPP-4 inhibitors plus metformin in adults with T2DM who did not respond 
adequately to metformin monotherapy. We estimated the incidence of micro- and 
macrovascular complications from risk equations incorporating the effect of 
treatment. The time horizon for analysis was 5 years and a discount rate of 5% 
was applied, for both costs and outcomes. The costs were expressed in 2020 USD 
(1 USD = $3,693.36 COP).
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin in association with metformin resulted in a higher number 
of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to the intervention. The ICER 
was US$1,964.80 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: From the point of view of Colombian healthcare system, the 
combination of dapagliflozin with metformin is a cost-effective option compared 
to DPP-4 + metformin inhibitors in the treatment of T2D without established 
cardiovascular disease.

While peptides can be excellent therapeutics for several conditions, their 
limited in vivo half-lives have been a major bottleneck in the development of 
therapeutic peptides. Conjugating the peptide to an inert chemical moiety is a 
strategy that has repeatedly proven to be successful in extending the half-life 
of some therapeutics. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to 
examine the available literature and assess it in an unbiased manner to 
determine which conjugates, both biological and synthetic, provide the greatest 
increase in therapeutic peptide half-life. Systematic searches run on PubMed, 
Scopus and SciFinder databases resulted in 845 studies pertaining to the topic, 
16 of these were included in this review after assessment against pre-specified 
inclusion criteria registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42020222579). The most common 
reasons for exclusion were non-IV administration and large peptide size. Of the 
16 studies that were included, a diverse suite of conjugates that increased 
half-life from 0.1 h to 33.57 h was identified. Amongst these peptides, the 
largest increase in half-life was seen when conjugated with glycosaminoglycans. 
A meta-analysis of studies that contained fatty acid conjugates indicated that 
acylation contributed to a statistically significant extension of half-life. 
Additionally, another meta-analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis suggested 
that conjugation with specifically engineered recombinant peptides might 
contribute to a more efficient extension of peptide half-life as compared to 
PEGylation. Moreover, we confirmed that while polyethylene glycol is a good 
synthetic conjugate, its chain length likely has an impact on its effectiveness 
in extending half-life. Furthermore, we found that most animal studies do not 
include as much detail when reporting findings as compared to human studies. 
Inclusion of additional experimental detail on aspects such as independent 
assessment and randomization may be an easily accomplished strategy to drive 
more conjugated peptides towards clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Siponimod is an effective treatment for patients with secondary 
progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), with active disease evidenced by relapses 
or imaging features characteristic of multiple sclerosis inflammatory activity, 
however there is a need to evaluate its economic value and sustainability 
compared to other disease modifying-therapies (DMTs).
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the siponimod cost-effectiveness profile and its relative 
budget impact compared with other DMTs, by using the Italian National Healthcare 
System perspective.
METHODS: We performed: 1) a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) vs interferon 
beta-1b using an analytical Markov model and a life time-horizon, and 2) a 
budget impact analysis by using 3-years time-horizon. The results were reported 
as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net-monetary benefit (NMB) 
for CEA, using a willingness to pay threshold of €40,000 per QALY gained, and as 
difference in the overall budget (Euro) between the scenario with and without 
siponimod for budget impact.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario siponimod resulted cost-effective compared 
with interferon beta-1b 28,891€ per QALY. Overall, the market access of 
siponimod was associated to an increased budget of about 3€ millions (+0.9%) in 
the next 3 years simulated.
CONCLUSION: Compared to interferon beta-1b, siponimod seems to be cost-effective 
in SPMS patients and sustainable, with less than 1% overall budget increased in 
the next 3 years. Future studies need to confirm our results in the real word 
setting and in other countries.

INTRODUCTION: In stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prophylactic 
cranial irradiation (PCI) reduces the brain metastases incidence and prolongs 
the progression-free survival without improving overall survival. PCI increases 
the risk of toxicity and is currently not adopted in routine care. Our objective 
was to assess the cost-effectiveness of PCI compared with no PCI in stage III 
NSCLC from a Dutch societal perspective.
METHODS: A cohort partitioned survival model was developed based on individual 
patient data from three randomized phase III trials (N = 670). Quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and costs were estimated over a lifetime time horizon. A 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €80,000 per QALY was adopted. Sensitivity 
and scenario analyses were performed to address parameter uncertainty and to 
explore what parameters had the greatest impact on the cost-effectiveness 
results.
RESULTS: PCI was more effective and costly (0.443 QALYs, €10,123) than no PCI, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €22,843 per QALY 
gained. The probability of PCI being cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 
€80,000 per QALY was 93%. The probability of PCI gaining three and six 
additional months of life were 76% and 56%. The scenario analysis adding 
durvalumab increased the ICER to €35,159 per QALY gained. Using alternative 
survival distributions had little impact on the ICER. Assuming fewer PCI 
fractions and excluding indirect costs decreased the ICER to €18,263 and €5554 
per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: PCI is cost-effective compared to no PCI in stage III NSCLC, and 
could therefore, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, be considered in routine 
care.

Temporal and Spatial Trends From Counterfactual Scenarios of Physical Activity 
on Mortality, Years of Life Lost, and Life Expectancy Due to Noncommunicable 
Diseases in Argentina.

García-Witulski C.

BACKGROUND: This study estimates the spatial distribution and trends in 
preventable deaths, years of life lost (YLL), and life expectancy (LE), 
associated with noncommunicable diseases under alternative distributions of 
physical activity in Argentina.
METHODS: Potential impact fractions were used to calculate the preventable 
deaths and YLL attributable to various scenarios of physical activity. 
Cause-eliminated life tables were used to estimate LE gains, and Monte Carlo 
simulations were performed for uncertainty analysis.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2018, physical activity could have prevented up to 7544 to 
8220 potential deaths (≈4.27% of major noncommunicable diseases and ≈2.66% of 
all causes) and about 221 to 219 YLL per 100,000 inhabitants; between 0.67 and 
0.71 years of LE could have been gained. If the World Health Organization 
recommendations (at least 600 metabolic equivalent tasks minutes per week) had 
been achieved, between 2813 and 3111 potential deaths could have been prevented, 
about 80 fewer years of life (per 100,000 inhabitants) would have been lost, and 
0.23 years of LE could have been gained. A 15% reduction in insufficient 
physical activity has shown a small impact on outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Public health initiatives aimed at increasing population-wide 
physical activity could reduce noncommunicable disease deaths in Argentina.

The study of respiratory plasticity in animal models spans decades. At the 
bench, researchers use an array of techniques aimed at harnessing the power of 
plasticity within the central nervous system to restore respiration following 
spinal cord injury. This field of research is highly clinically relevant. People 
living with cervical spinal cord injury at or above the level of the phrenic 
motoneuron pool at spinal levels C3-C5 typically have significant impairments in 
breathing which may require assisted ventilation. Those who are ventilator 
dependent are at an increased risk of ventilator-associated co-morbidities and 
have a drastically reduced life expectancy. Pre-clinical research examining 
respiratory plasticity in animal models has laid the groundwork for clinical 
trials. Despite how widely researched this injury is in animal models, 
relatively few treatments have broken through the preclinical barrier. The three 
goals of this present review are to define plasticity as it pertains to 
respiratory function post-spinal cord injury, discuss plasticity models of 
spinal cord injury used in research, and explore the shift from preclinical to 
clinical research. By investigating current targets of respiratory plasticity 
research, we hope to illuminate preclinical work that can influence future 
clinical investigations and the advancement of treatments for spinal cord 
injury.

BACKGROUND: Stress factors lead to a shift in the antioxidant-prooxidant 
relationship, allowing an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) by mitochondria, which results in the development of oxidative stress. 
Consequently, it is possible to put forward an assumption that drugs which 
reduce the excessive generation of ROS by these organelles should increase the 
body's resistance to stress factors. Antioxidants can be used as such drugs. In 
this regard, the aim of this work was to study the bioenergetics characteristic 
of mitochondria under stress conditions and under the action of 
2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridinium hydroxybutanedioate (ethoxidol).
METHODS: The antiradical activity of the drug was evaluated by the 
chemiluminescent method (CL). The functional state of the mitochondria was 
studied with reference to the level of lipid peroxidation by the 
spectrofluorimetry and in terms of fatty acid composition of mitochondrial 
membranes using the chromatography technique. The study of mitochondrial 
morphology was performed employing the method of atomic force microscopy.
RESULTS: The injection in mice of ethoxidol at a dose of 10-5 mol/kg for 7 days 
led to the prevention of the stress-induced increase in the intensity of LPO in 
the membranes of the mitochondria, and swelling of these organelles; it also 
prevented a decrease in the content of unsaturated fatty acids, containing 18 
and 20 carbon atoms. At the same time, ethoxidol increased the life expectancy 
of mice by 3.0-4.2 times in conditions of various types of hypoxia.
CONCLUSION: The adaptogenic properties of ethoxidol can be attributed to its 
antiradical and antioxidant properties.

BACKGROUND: Although effective against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 
hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination is only recommended for infants, children, and 
adults at higher risk. We conducted an economic evaluation of universal HepB 
vaccination among US adults.
METHODS: Using a decision analytic model with Markov disease progression, we 
compared current vaccination recommendations (baseline) with either 3-dose or 
2-dose universal HepB vaccination (intervention strategies). In simulated 
modeling of 1 million adults distributed by age and risk groups, we quantified 
health benefits (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and costs for each 
strategy. Multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses identified key 
inputs. All costs reported in 2019 US dollars.
RESULTS: With incremental base-case vaccination coverage up to 50% among persons 
at lower risk and 0% increment among persons at higher risk, each of 2 
intervention strategies averted nearly one-quarter of acute HBV infections 
(3-dose strategy, 24.8%; 2-dose strategy, 24.6%). Societal incremental cost per 
QALY gained of $152 722 (interquartile range, $119 113-$235 086) and $155 429 
(interquartile range, $120 302-$242 226) were estimated for 3-dose and 2-dose 
strategies, respectively. Risk of acute HBV infection showed the strongest 
influence.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal adult vaccination against HBV may be an appropriate 
strategy for reducing HBV incidence and improving resulting health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Estimating life expectancy of older adults informs whether to pursue 
future investigation and therapy. Several models to predict mortality have been 
developed but often require data not immediately available during routine
