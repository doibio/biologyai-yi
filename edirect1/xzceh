Antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection/AIDS has significantly extended the 
life expectancy of HIV-1-infected individuals and reduced HIV-1 transmission at 
very high rates. However, certain individuals who initially achieve viral 
suppression to undetectable levels may eventually suffer treatment failure 
mainly due to adverse effects and the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 
variants. Here, we report GRL-142, a novel HIV-1 protease inhibitor containing 
an unprecedented 6-5-5-ring-fused crown-like tetrahydropyranofuran, which has 
extremely potent activity against all HIV-1 strains examined with IC50 values of 
attomolar-to-picomolar concentrations, virtually no effects on cellular growth, 
extremely high genetic barrier against the emergence of drug-resistant variants, 
and favorable intracellular and central nervous system penetration. GRL-142 
forms optimum polar, van der Waals, and halogen bond interactions with HIV-1 
protease and strongly blocks protease dimerization, demonstrating that combined 
multiple optimizing elements significantly enhance molecular and atomic 
interactions with a target protein and generate unprecedentedly potent and 
practically favorable agents.

Popular demand for high quality care has increased in recent years. This is also 
the case for medical services and support at all times of the day and night is 
nowadays required. During the last ten years, there has been a marked increase 
in the demands on hospital emergency hospitals, particularly in the Western 
industrialized countries. The present retrospective study investigates how the 
demands on a large Swiss university centre have changed over a period of 10 
years. Patient numbers are differentiated by age, gender, nationality, weekday 
and mode of referral. A retrospective analysis was performed of the data of the 
patients admitted to the Emergency Centre of Bern University Medical Hospital 
(Inselspital) during the ten-year period from 2004 up to and including 2013 and 
who were treated as emergencies. A total of 264,272 patients were included in 
the study. It was shown that there was an uninterrupted annual increase from 
23,555 patients in 2004 to 34,918 patients in 2013 (+48%). Most patients came to 
the Emergency Centre on Mondays, followed by Fridays. Because of the marked 
increase in life expectancy and the resulting demographic changes, there has 
been a marked increase in the number of older patients coming to the Emergency 
Centre for acute medical care. It was found that there were disproportionately 
high numbers of patients aged 20 to 49 years who were not Swiss citizens. In 
contrast, most patients over 60 were Swiss. In the coming years, emergency 
centres will have to adapt to the continued increase in patient numbers. This 
trend will continue, so that it is essential to consider the sociodemographic 
structure of a region when planning the availability of emergency medical care.

PURPOSE: To determine the changes in indications for orbital exenteration over 
20 years and to assess its impact on patient survival. Evolving techniques of 
rehabilitation of the orbit in our institution were also evaluated.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of hospital records of patients who 
underwent orbital exenteration from 1995 to 2015 in a tertiary care center. Data 
extracted included primary location of the tumor, preoperative treatments, 
interval between initial diagnosis and exenteration, status of surgical margins, 
presence of metastatic disease, and postoperative survival. The types of 
prosthesis utilized over the years were also reviewed. Cox regression analysis 
was performed for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to 
estimate post-exenteration survival.
RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, orbital exenteration was performed on 100 orbits 
of 100 patients. The mean age was 39.4 years (range: 2 months to 90 years). The 
most common indications among 98 malignant causes were retinoblastoma, squamous 
cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, extraocular extension of uveal melanoma, 
and conjunctival melanoma. Postoperative survival was significantly related to 
age and tumor location but independent from gender, surgical margin, 
histopathological diagnosis, previous treatment modality, and preoperative 
interval. In the whole cohort, 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 97% and 
84%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Exenteration appears to be life-saving in children with orbital 
extension of retinoblastoma. While patients exenterated for malignant eyelid 
tumors have the best chance of survival, those with orbital extension of uveal 
melanoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland have the worst 
prognosis.

Background A number of factors regarding blood collection, handling and storage 
may affect sample quality. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on 
plasma protein profiles by delayed centrifugation and plasma separation and 
multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Methods Blood samples drawn from 16 healthy 
individuals were collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes and kept 
either at 4 °C or 22 °C for 1-36 h prior to centrifugation. Plasma samples 
prepared 1 h after venipuncture were also subjected to two to eight cycles of 
freezing at -80 °C and thawing at 22 °C. Multiplex proximity extension assay, an 
antibody-based protein assay, was used to investigate the influence on plasma 
proteins. Results Up to 36 h delay before blood centrifugation resulted in 
significant increases of 16 and 40 out of 139 detectable proteins in samples 
kept at 4 °C or 22 °C, respectively. Some increases became noticeable after 8 h 
delay at 4 °C but already after 1 h at 22 °C. For samples stored at 4 °C, 
epidermal growth factor (EGF), NF-kappa-B essential modulator, SRC, interleukin 
16 and CD6 increased the most, whereas the five most significantly increased 
proteins after storage at 22 °C were CD40 antigen ligand (CD40-L), EGF, 
platelet-derived growth factor subunit B, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 and 
matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Only matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) 
decreased significantly over time and only after storage at 22 °C. No protein 
levels were found to be significantly affected by up to eight freeze-thaw 
cycles. Conclusions Plasma should be prepared from blood after a limited 
precentrifugation delay at a refrigerated temperature. By contrast, the 
influence by several freeze-thaw cycles on detectable protein levels in plasma 
was negligible.

BACKGROUND: The optimal technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is 
controversial, and both single and double-row techniques are commonly used. In 
the current era of increasing costs, health-care delivery models are focusing on 
the value of care. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of 
single-row and double-row reconstructions in patients undergoing arthroscopic 
rotator cuff repair.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of a 
publicly funded health-care system. Health-care costs, probabilities, and 
utility values were derived from the published literature. Efficacy data were 
obtained from a previous randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of 
single-row (n = 48) or double-row (n = 42) reconstruction among 90 surgical 
patients. Unit cost data were obtained from a hospital database and the Ontario 
Schedule of Benefits and Fees. Results are presented as an incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. All costs are presented in 2015 
Canadian dollars. A series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Double-row fixation was more costly ($2,134.41 compared with $1,654.76) 
but was more effective than the single-row method (4.073 compared with 4.055 
QALYs). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be 
$26,666.75 per QALY gained for double-row relative to single-row fixation. A 
subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients with larger rotator cuff tears (≥3 
cm) had a lower ICER, suggesting that double-row fixation may be more 
cost-effective for larger tears.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY 
gained, double-row fixation was found to be more cost-effective than single-row. 
Furthermore, a double-row reconstruction was found to be more economically 
attractive for larger rotator cuff tears (≥3 cm).

Zebra chip disease (ZC) is an emerging disease of potato in which tubers are 
produced with striped necrotic patterns that make them unmarketable. ZC is 
associated with the bacterium "Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum" (Lso), 
which is transmitted by the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Šulc; 
Hemiptera: Triozidae). First found in Idaho during 2011, ZC now contributes to 
increased production costs each season via additional insecticide sprays. To 
clarify the extent and severity of the threat of ZC in Idaho, we sampled potato 
psyllids in commercial potato fields across the state over four growing seasons 
(2012-2015). All life stages of psyllids were sampled using a combination of 
methods (yellow sticky traps, vacuum samples, and leaf samples), and adult 
psyllids were tested for the presence of Lso by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). 
Abundance of potato psyllids initially increased gradually over each growing 
season, then exhibited a sharp late-season rise and a sharp decline as most 
fields were being harvested. Abundance of psyllids was higher at warmer, lower 
elevation sites, but infestation onset did not differ between growing regions. 
Fewer psyllids were collected in vacuum samples than in sticky trap samples. 
Nymphs and eggs were found only late season and during years with high abundance 
of adults. Overall incidence of Lso was similar among all years but one. The 
results presented here clarify our understanding of the seasonal phenology of 
potato psyllids and Lso in Idaho potato fields and will aid in developing 
integrated management strategies against this important pest of potato.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed at estimating the efficiency of palivizumab in the 
prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and its sequelae in 
preterm infants (32day 1-35day 0weeks of gestational age -wGA-) in Spain.
METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed to compare health benefits (Quality 
Adjusted Life Years-QALYs) and costs of palivizumab versus a non-prophylaxis 
strategy over 6 years. A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 preterm infants, 32day 
1-35day 0 wGA (4.356 kg average weight) at the beginning of the prophylaxis 
(15 mg/kg of palivizumab; 3.88 average number of injections per RSV season) was 
analysed. The model considered the most recent evidence from Spanish 
observational and epidemiological studies on RSV infection: the FLIP II study 
provided hospital admission and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates; 
in-hospital mortality rate was drawn from an epidemiological study from 2004 to 
2012; recurrent wheezing rates associated to RSV infection from SPRING study 
were adjusted by the evidence on the palivizumab effect from clinical trials. 
Quality of life baseline value, number of hospitalized infants and the presence 
of recurrent wheezing over time were granted to estimate QALYs. National Health 
Service and societal perspective (included also recurrent wheezing indirect 
cost) were analysed. Total costs (€, 2016) included pharmaceutical and 
administration costs, hospitalization costs and recurrent wheezing management 
annual costs. A discount rate of 3.0% was applied annually for both costs and 
health outcomes.
RESULTS: Over 6 years, the base case analysis showed that palivizumab was 
associated to an increase of 0.0731 QALYs compared to non-prophylaxis. Total 
costs were estimated in €2,110.71 (palivizumab) and €671.68 (non-prophylaxis) 
from the National Health System (NHS) perspective, resulting in an incremental 
cost utility ratio (ICUR) of €19,697.69/QALYs gained (prophylaxis vs 
non-prophylaxis). Results derived from the risk-factors population subgroups 
analysed were in line with the total population results. From the societal 
perspective, the incremental cost associated to palivizumab decreased to an 
€1,253.14 (ICUR = €17,153.16€/QALYs gained for palivizumab vs non-prophylaxis). 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: The prophylaxis with palivizumab is efficient for preventing from 
RSV infections in preterm infants 32day 1-35day 0 wGA in Spain.

than Elongation in Cervical Spine Dislocation.

Cervical spine dislocation and fracture of a transverse process are isolated 
risk factors for vertebral artery injuries (VAIs), which can cause a 
life-threatening ischemic stroke. Since in vivo experiments are not possible, it 
has not been unclear whether damage to or extension of vertebral arteries is 
more predictive of a VAI. To identify the imaging characteristics associated 
with VAI, we analyzed 36 vertebral arteries from 22 cervical spine dislocation 
patients who underwent computed tomography angiography (Aug. 2008-Dec. 2014). We 
evaluated (1) the posttraumatic elongation of the vertebral artery and (2) the 
presence of fracture involving the transverse foramen. VAI was found in 20 (56%) 
of the 36 vertebral arteries. The rate of residual shift (vertebral artery 
elongation) was not markedly different between the VAI and no-VAI groups. 
However, the rate of >1 mm displacement into the foramen and that of fracture 
with gross displacement (≥2 mm) differed significantly between the groups. We 
found that greater displacement of fractured transverse processes with cervical 
spine dislocation was a risk factor for VAI. These results suggest that direct 
damage to the vertebral arteries by transverse process fragments is more likely 
to predict a VAI compared to elongation, even in cervical spine dislocation.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by recurrent attacks of 
subcutaneous or submucosal edema. Attacks are unpredictable, debilitating, and 
have a significant impact on quality of life. Patients may be prescribed 
prophylactic therapy to prevent angioedema attacks. Current prophylactic 
treatments may be difficult to administer (i.e., intravenously), require 
frequent administrations or are not well tolerated, and breakthrough attacks may 
still occur frequently. Lanadelumab is a subcutaneously-administered monoclonal 
antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in clinical development for prophylaxis 
of hereditary angioedema attacks. A Phase 1b study supported its efficacy in 
preventing attacks. A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-arm study has been completed and an open-label extension is currently 
ongoing.
METHODS/DESIGN: The primary objective of the open-label extension is to evaluate 
the long-term safety of repeated subcutaneous administrations of lanadelumab in 
patients with type I/II HAE. Secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy 
and time to first angioedema attack to determine outer bounds of the dosing 
interval. The study will also evaluate immunogenicity, 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, quality of life, characteristics of 
breakthrough attacks, ease of self-administration, and safety/efficacy in 
patients who switch to lanadelumab from another prophylactic therapy. The 
open-label extension will enroll patients who completed the double-blind study 
("rollover patients") and those who did not participate in the double-blind 
study ("non-rollover patients"), which includes patients who may or may not be 
currently using another prophylactic therapy. Rollover patients will receive a 
single 300 mg dose of lanadelumab on Day 0 and the second dose after the 
patient's first confirmed angioedema attack. Thereafter, lanadelumab will be 
administered every 2 weeks. Non-rollover patients will receive 300 mg 
lanadelumab every 2 weeks regardless of the first attack. All patients will 
receive their last dose on Day 350 (maximum of 26 doses), and will then undergo 
a 4-week follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Prevention of attacks can reduce the burden of illness associated 
with HAE. Prophylactic therapy requires extended, repeated dosing and the 
results of this study will provide important data on the long-term safety and 
efficacy of lanadelumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein 
for subcutaneous administration for the treatment of HAE. Trial registration 
NCT02741596.

Lung transplantation has grown considerably in recent years and its availability 
has spread to an expanding number of countries worldwide. Importantly, survival 
has also steadily improved, making this an increasingly viable procedure for 
patients with end-stage lung disease and limited life expectancy. In this first 
of a series of articles, recipient selection and type of transplant operation 
are reviewed. Pulmonary fibrotic disorders are now the most indication in the 
U.S., followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. 
Transplant centers have liberalized criteria to include older and more 
critically ill candidates. A careful, systematic, multi-disciplinary selection 
process is critical in identifying potential barriers that may increase risk and 
optimize long-term outcomes.

USA.

Continuous flow technology has dramatically improved patient survival during 
ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy in recent years. Health-related quality 
of life is improved by at least two years. Despite remarkable progress in this 
field, major adverse events during VAD support limit the effectiveness of this 
therapy and present major barriers to its extension to ambulatory advanced heart 
failure patients. The pace of progress will depend on improvements in both the 
adverse event profile and development of semi-quantitative methodology to 
calculate and display a composite of survival and health-related quality of 
life.

Renouncement of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a medical dilemma. This 
review covers the concept, the magnitude, the prognosis, and discusses 
strategies and management approaches about this subject in patients with CKD and 
AKI. Evidence suggests that refusal is more frequent and carries a more guarded 
prognosis than withdrawal of RRT. When RRT is not expected to be beneficial in 
terms of survival or quality of life, conservative treatment and palliative care 
are alternatives. We review the historical evolution of guidelines about 
renouncement of RRT and palliative care, and highlight the absence of specific 
recommendations in Brazil. However renouncement of RRT may be ethically and 
legally accepted in Brazil, as the right to a dignified death. Longer life 
expectancy, economic pressures, and greater awareness will require a more 
detailed discussion about indications and sustainable use of RRT, and possibly 
the elaboration of national guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prevalent and debilitating symptom 
experienced by cancer survivors, yet treatment options for CRF are limited. In 
this study, we evaluated the efficacy of weekly Swedish massage therapy (SMT) 
versus an active control condition (light touch [LT]) and waitlist control (WLC) 
on persistent CRF in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: This early phase, randomized, single-masked, 6-week investigation of 
SMT, LT, and WLC enrolled 66 female stage 0-III breast cancer survivors (age 
range, 32-72 years) who had received surgery plus radiation and/or 
chemotherapy/chemoprevention with CRF (Brief Fatigue Inventory > 25). The 
primary outcome was the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), with the 
National Institutes of Health PROMIS Fatigue scale secondary.
RESULTS: Mean baseline MFI scores for 57 evaluable subjects were 62.95 for SMT, 
55.00 for LT, and 60.41 for WLC. SMT resulted in a mean (standard deviation) 
6-week reduction in MFI total scores of -16.50 (6.37) (n = 20) versus -8.06 
(6.50) for LT (n = 20) and an increase of 5.88 (6.48) points for WLC (n = 17) 
(treatment-by-time P < .0001). The mean baseline PROMIS Fatigue scores were SMT, 
22.25; LT, 22.05; and WLC, 23.24. The mean (standard deviation) reduction in 
PROMIS Fatigue scores was -5.49 (2.53) points for SMT versus -3.24 (2.57) points 
for LT and -0.06 (1.88) points for WLC (treatment-by-time P = .0008). Higher 
credibility, expectancy, and preference for SMT than for LT did not account for 
these results.
CONCLUSION: SMT produced clinically significant relief of CRF. This finding 
suggests that 6 weeks of a safe, widely accepted manual intervention causes a 
significant reduction in fatigue, a debilitating sequela for cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With increasing life expectancy of patients with bone 
metastasis, durable surgical stabilization of bone metastasis is necessary. 
Local recurrence (LR) can compromise surgical stabilization and necessitate 
retreatment. We analyzed LR rate and factors associated with LR in patients 
undergoing surgery for bone metastasis.
METHODS: Patients (n = 301) who underwent surgery for bone metastasis to the 
extremities were reviewed. Possible factors that might be associated with LR 
were investigated.
RESULTS: LR rate was 16% (49/301). Surgical margin was associated with LR, as 
patients with en-bloc resection had significantly less LR than patients who 
underwent curettage (5/66 vs 44/235, P = 0.03). Prostate cancer had lowest rate 
(0%) of LR and colon cancer had highest rate (31%). Interval from surgery to LR 
differed among primary cancer types (4.5 ± 3.9 months [lung cancer], vs 
12.3 ± 12.9 months [other cancers], P = 0.041). In multivariate analysis, 
en-bloc surgical margins (HR = 0.372, P = 0.036) and primary cancers of breast 
or prostate (HR = 0.391, P = 0.049) were independent factors associated with 
longer LR-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: LR after surgery for bone metastasis to extremities is affected by 
surgical margin and primary cancer type. These factors, along with expected 
patient survival, need to be considered when planning surgery for bone 
metastasis to extremities.

OBJECTIVE: To review Australian policies on active transport, defined as walking 
and cycling for utilitarian purposes. To estimate the potential health impact of 
achieving four active transport policy scenarios.
METHODS: A policy review was undertaken, using key words to search government 
websites. Potential health benefits were quantified using a cohort simulation 
Markov model to estimate obesity and transport injury-related health effects of 
an increase in active transport. Health adjusted life years (HALYs) gained and 
healthcare cost savings from diseases averted were estimated. Budget thresholds 
to achieve cost-effectiveness were estimated for each scenario.
RESULTS: There is broad recognition of the health-related benefits of active 
transport from all levels of Australian government. Modelling results suggest 
significant health-related benefits of achieving increased prevalence of active 
transport. Total HALYs saved assuming a one-year effect ranged from 565 (95%UI 
173-985) to 12,105 (95%UI 4,970-19,707), with total healthcare costs averted 
ranging from $6.6M (95%UI $1.9M-11.3M) to $141.2M (95%UI $53.8M-227.8M).
CONCLUSION: Effective interventions that improve rates of active transport may 
result in substantial healthcare-related cost savings through a decrease in 
conditions related to obesity. Implications for public health: Significant 
potential exists for effective and cost-effective interventions that result in 
more walking and cycling.

BACKGROUND: Coffee drinking has been implicated in mortality and a variety of 
diseases but potential mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. 
Large-scale systems epidemiological approaches may offer novel insights to 
mechanisms underlying associations of coffee with health.
OBJECTIVE: We performed an analysis of known and novel protein markers linked to 
cardiovascular disease and their association with habitual coffee intake in the 
Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS, n = 816) and 
followed up top proteins in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM, 
n = 635) and EpiHealth (n = 2418).
METHODS: In PIVUS and ULSAM, coffee intake was measured by 7-day dietary records 
whilst a computer-based food frequency questionnaire was used in EpiHealth. 
Levels of up to 80 proteins were assessed in plasma by a proximity extension 
assay.
RESULTS: Four protein-coffee associations adjusted for age, sex, smoking and 
BMI, met statistical significance in PIVUS (FDR < 5%, P < 2.31 × 10-3 ): leptin 
(LEP), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 
6 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The inverse association between 
coffee intake and LEP replicated in ULSAM (β, -0.042 SD per cup of coffee, P = 
0.028) and EpiHealth (β, -0.025 SD per time of coffee, P = 0.004). The negative 
coffee-CHI3L association replicated in EpiHealth (β, -0.07, P = 1.15 × 10-7 ), 
but not in ULSAM (β, -0.034, P = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study supports an inverse association between coffee 
intake and plasma LEP and CHI3L1 levels. The coffee-CHI3L1 association is novel 
and warrants further investigation given links between CHI3L1 and health 
conditions that are also potentially influenced by coffee.

CONTEXT: Testicular germ-cell tumors (GCT) are highly curable. A 
multidisciplinary approach, including cisplatin-based chemotherapy has resulted 
in cure in the majority of patients with GCT. Thus, the life expectancy of 
survivors will extend to many decades post-diagnosis. Late treatment toxicities 
associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy may impact their future health.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate evidence regarding the long-term toxicity 
of cisplatin in GCT survivors.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We carried out a critical review of PubMed/Medline in 
February 2017 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review 
and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Identified reports were reviewed according 
to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria. 
Eighty-three publications were selected for inclusion in this analysis.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Included reports evaluated long-term toxicities of 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy in GCT survivors. Studies reporting neuro- and 
ototoxicity, secondary malignancies, cardiovascular, renal and pulmonary 
toxicities, hypogonadism and infertility were found. Seven studies (8%) reported 
genetic underpinnings of long-term toxicities and 3 (4%) and 14 (19%) studies 
correlated long-term toxicities with circulating platinum levels and cumulative 
dose of cisplatin, respectively. Significant risks for long-term toxicities 
associated with cisplatin and platinum-based regimens were reported. The 
cumulative dose of cisplatin and circulating platinum were reported as risk 
factors. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified patients susceptible 
to cisplatin compared with wild-type individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: GCT survivors cured with cisplatin-based chemotherapy are at risk 
for long-term side-effects. Detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms could 
be a valuable tool for predicting long-term toxicities.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Herein, this article summarizes the available evidence of 
long-term toxicity of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in GCT survivors and provide 
insights from Indiana University.

AIMS: To support decision-making regarding prosthetic valve selection in 
non-elderly adults, we aim to provide a detailed overview of outcome after 
contemporary mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review was conducted for papers reporting 
clinical outcome after AVR with bileaflet mechanical valves with a mean patient 
age ≥18 and ≤55 years, published between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2015. 
Through meta-analysis outcomes were pooled and entered into a microsimulation 
model to calculate (event-free) life expectancy and lifetime event risk. 
Twenty-nine publications, encompassing a total of 5728 patients with 32 515 
patient-years of follow-up (pooled mean follow-up: 5.7 years), were included. 
Pooled mean age at surgery was 48.0 years. Pooled early mortality risk was 3.15% 
(95% confidence interval (CI):2.37-4.23), late mortality rate was 1.55%/year 
(95%CI:1.25-1.92); 38.7% of late deaths were valve-related. Pooled 
thromboembolism rate was 0.90%/year (95%CI:0.68-1.21), major bleeding 0.85%/year 
(95%CI:0.65-1.12), nonstructural valve dysfunction 0.39%/year (95%CI:0.21-0.76), 
endocarditis 0.41%/year (95%CI:0.29-0.57), valve thrombosis 0.14%/year 
(95%CI:0.08-0.25), structural valve deterioration 0.00%/year (zero events 
observed), and reintervention 0.51%/year (95%CI:0.37-0.71), mostly due to 
nonstructural valve dysfunction and endocarditis. For a 45-year-old, for 
example, this translated to an estimated life expectancy of 19 years (general 
population: 34 years) and lifetime risks of thromboembolism, bleeding and 
reintervention of 18%, 15%, and 10%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that outcome after mechanical AVR in 
non-elderly adults is characterized by suboptimal survival and considerable 
lifetime risk of anticoagulation-related complications, but also reoperation. 
Non-elderly adult patients who are facing prosthetic valve selection are 
entitled to conveyance of evidence-based estimates of the risks and benefits of 
both mechanical and biological valve options in a shared decision-making 
process.

Arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome is an 
autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the VPS33B or VIPAS39 gene. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and VPS33B gene 
mutations of an infant with ARC syndrome. A 47-day-old female infant was 
referred to the hospital with the complaint of jaundiced skin and sclera for 45 
days and abnormal liver function for 39 days. The patient had been managed in 
different hospitals, but the therapeutic effects were unsatisfactory due to 
undetermined diagnosis. Physical examination showed jaundice of the skin and 
sclera. Systemic skin was dry with desquamation in the limbs and trunk. There 
were no positive signs on cardiopulmonary examination. The liver was palpable 
2.0 cm under the right subcostal margin. The hips and knees were flexed, and the 
extension was limited, with low muscular tone in the four limbs. Biochemical 
analysis demonstrated raised serum total bile acids, bilirubin (predominantly 
conjugated bilirubin) and transaminases, but the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase level 
was normal. Routine urine test revealed increased glucose as well as red and 
white blood cells. On genetic analysis, the infant was proved to be homologous 
for a VPS33B mutation c.1594C>T(p.R532X). She was definitely diagnosed to have 
ARC syndrome. Symptomatic and supportive therapy was given, but no improvement 
was observed, and the infant finally died at 3 months and 29 days of life.

During the developmental process of sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
membrane structures called prospore membranes are formed de novo, expand, 
extend, acquire a round shape, and finally become plasma membranes of the 
spores. GIP1 encodes a regulatory/targeting subunit of protein phosphatase type 
1 that is required for sporulation. Gip1 recruits the catalytic subunit Glc7 to 
septin structures that form along the prospore membrane; however, the molecular 
basis of its localization and function is not fully understood. Here we show 
that Gip1 changes its localization dynamically and is required for prospore 
membrane extension. Gip1 first associates with the spindle pole body as the 
prospore membrane forms, moves onto the prospore membrane and then to the 
septins as the membrane extends, distributes around the prospore membrane after 
closure, and finally translocates into the nucleus in the maturing spore. 
Deletion and mutation analyses reveal distinct sequences in Gip1 that are 
required for different localizations and for association with Glc7. Binding to 
Glc7 is also required for proper localization. Strikingly, localization to the 
prospore membrane, but not association with septins, is important for Gip1 
function. Further, our genetic analysis suggests that a Gip1-Glc7 phosphatase 
complex regulates prospore membrane extension in parallel to the previously 
reported Vps13, Spo71, Spo73 pathway.
