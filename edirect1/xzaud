osteoarthritis and obesity in comparison with the reference group.
SETTING: United States.
PARTICIPANTS: U.S. population aged 50 to 84 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years lost owing to knee osteoarthritis and 
obesity.
RESULTS: Estimated total losses of per-person quality-adjusted life-years ranged 
from 1.857 in nonobese persons with knee osteoarthritis to 3.501 for persons 
affected by both conditions, resulting in a total of 86.0 million 
quality-adjusted life-years lost due to obesity, knee osteoarthritis, or both. 
Quality-adjusted life-years lost due to knee osteoarthritis and/or obesity 
represent 10% to 25% of the remaining quality-adjusted survival of persons aged 
50 to 84 years. Hispanic and black women had disproportionately high losses. 
Model findings suggested that reversing obesity prevalence to levels seen 10 
years ago would avert 178,071 cases of coronary heart disease, 889,872 cases of 
diabetes, and 111,206 total knee replacements. Such a reduction in obesity would 
increase the quantity of life by 6,318,030 years and improve life expectancy by 
7,812,120 quality-adjusted years in U.S. adults aged 50 to 84 years.
LIMITATIONS: Comorbidity incidences were derived from prevalence estimates on 
the basis of life expectancy of the general population, potentially resulting in 
conservative underestimates. Calibration analyses were conducted to ensure 
comparability of model-based projections and data from external sources.
CONCLUSION: The number of quality-adjusted life-years lost owing to knee 
osteoarthritis and obesity seems to be substantial, with black and Hispanic 
women experiencing disproportionate losses. Reducing mean body mass index to the 
levels observed a decade ago in this population would yield substantial health 
benefits.

BACKGROUND: Reducing geographical inequalities in cancer survival in England was 
a key aim of the Calman-Hine Report (1995) and the NHS Cancer Plan (2000). This 
study assesses whether geographical inequalities changed following these policy 
developments by analysing the trend in 1-year relative survival in the 28 cancer 
networks of England.
METHODS: Population-based age-standardised relative survival at 1 year is 
estimated for 1.4 million patients diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus, 
stomach, colon, lung, breast (women) or cervix in England during 1991-2006 and 
followed up to 2007. Regional and deprivation-specific life tables are built to 
adjust survival estimates for differences in background mortality. Analysis is 
divided into three calendar periods: 1991-5, 1996-2000 and 2001-6. Funnel plots 
are used to assess geographical variation in survival over time.
RESULTS: One-year relative survival improved for all cancers except cervical 
cancer. There was a wide geographical variation in survival with generally lower 
estimates in northern England. This north-south divide became less marked over 
time, although the overall number of cancer networks that were lower outliers 
compared with the England value remained stable. Breast cancer was the only 
cancer for which there was a marked reduction in geographical inequality in 
survival over time.
CONCLUSION: Policy changes over the past two decades coincided with improved 
relative survival, without an increase in geographical variation. The 
north-south divide in relative survival became less pronounced over time but 
geographical inequalities persist. The reduction in geographical inequality in 
breast cancer survival may be followed by a similar trend for other cancers, 
provided government recommendations are implemented similarly.

Iron chelation in thalassemia: time to reconsider our comfort zones.

Over the last 20 years, the management of thalassemia major has improved to the 
point where we predict that the patients' life expectancy will approach that of 
the normal population. These outcomes result from safer blood transfusions, the 
availability of three iron chelators, new imaging techniques that allow 
organ-specific assessment of the degree of iron overload and improvement in the 
treatment of hepatitis. The ability to prescribe any of the three chelators, as 
well as their combinations, has led to a more effective reduction of the total 
body iron. The ability to determine the amount of iron in the liver and heart by 
MRI has allowed the prescription of the most appropriate chelation regime for 
the patient and has allowed the reconsideration of 'the comfort zones'. Thus, 
normalizing iron stores not only prevents new morbidities but also reverses many 
complications, such as cardiac failure, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, impaired 
glucose tolerance and Type 2 diabetes, therefore improving survival and 
patients' quality of life. Furthermore, outcomes should continue to improve in 
the future. Starting relatively intensive chelation in younger children may 
prevent short stature and abnormal pubertal maturation, as well as other 
iron-related morbidities. In addition, further information should become 
available on the use of other combinations in chelation treatment, some of which 
have only been used in a very limited fashion so far. New safe oral chelators 
may also become available that may offer additional ease of use. All these 
advances in management do require absolute cooperation and understanding on 
behalf of children's parents and subsequently the adult themself. Only with such 
cooperation can normal long-term survival be achieved as it is likely that 
adherence to treatment is the primary barrier to longevity.

INTRODUCTION: Over the last few decades, the population of developed countries 
has aged. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among the increased numbers of 
older women. The choice of adjuvant treatment is particularly difficult in older 
women because the oncologist has to balance reduction of the risk of recurrence 
with patient-related comorbidities that may increase the risk of 
treatment-related toxicity and influence patient survival.
AREAS COVERED: This article describes the concept of a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment and reviews the current literature on biological and pathological 
characteristics of breast cancer in the elderly, including genomic assays 
recently available in the clinic. Endocrine, targeted and chemotherapy 
treatments both in adjuvant and metastatic setting are also covered.
EXPERT OPINION: A new generation of studies aimed to re-evaluate treatments in 
the various subtypes of breast cancer is needed. Whether this will be possible 
through prospective studies (especially in the adjuvant setting) is unknown. An 
alternative direction for further research in the elderly could be a reappraisal 
of old studies with carefully planned subtype analyses. Whatever the direction, 
the management of elderly breast-cancer patients is inherently 
multidisciplinary: the contribution of medical and allied health professionals 
is essential to the provision of optimal care.

of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

Islet cell transplantation is in clinical development for type 1 diabetes. There 
are no data on the cost in relationship to its benefits. We performed a 
cost-effectiveness analysis and made a comparison with standard insulin therapy, 
using Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulations. The patient population was 
adults aged 20 yr suffering from hypoglycemia unawareness. Data were estimates 
from literature and clinical trials: costs were based on the situation in the 
United States. For insulin therapy, cumulative cost per patient during a 20-yr 
follow-up was $663,000, and cumulative effectiveness was 9.3 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY), the average cost-effectiveness ratio being $71,000 per QALY. 
Islet transplantation had a cumulative cost of $519,000, a cumulative 
effectiveness of 10.9 QALY, and an average cost-effectiveness ratio of $47,800. 
During the first 10 yr, costs for transplantation were higher, but cumulative 
effectiveness was higher from the start onwards. In sensitivity analyses, the 
need for one instead of two transplants during the first year did not affect the 
conclusions, and islet transplantation remained cost-saving up to an initial 
cost of the procedure of $240,000. This exploratory evaluation shows that islet 
cell transplantation is more effective than standard insulin treatment, and 
becomes cost-saving at about 9-10 yr after transplantation.

Indicators of alcohol consumption and attributable harm for monitoring and 
surveillance in European Union countries.

Rehm J(1), Scafato E.

Germany. mail: jtrehm@aol.com

AIMS: Alcohol is a major risk factor for burden of disease and injury in Europe, 
and contributes markedly to between region differences in life expectancy. 
Monitoring and surveillance systems have shown to be a key factor in 
implementing effective policies. The aim of this paper is to propose a system of 
indicators for alcohol consumption and attributable harm which can be used as an 
over-time monitoring tool at the country level as well as for comparisons 
between countries.
DESIGN: A systematic research in electronic data bases was conducted but most of 
the information was derived from ongoing international efforts to establish 
alcohol monitoring and surveillance systems.
SETTING: European Union.
PARTICIPANTS: Countries.
MEASUREMENTS: Exposure to alcohol, mortality, burden of disease.
FINDINGS: Adult per capita alcohol consumption, prevalence of abstention, and 
frequency of drinking more than 60 g pure alcohol in one occasion are proposed 
as a minimal set of alcohol exposure indicators, which can quickly be 
implemented in all EU countries. With respect to health harm indicators, the 
best minimal choice which can be implemented quickly in all countries of the EU 
would be alcohol-attributable years of life lost due to premature death. In 
addition, country specific indicators could be added, when alcohol places 
specific burden on specific diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: National and European Union-wide monitoring systems for alcohol 
exposure and attributable harm to inform public health-related policy decisions 
could be implemented easily. The establishement of such monitoring systems would 
follow the recent World Assembly resolution for a global strategy to reduce 
alcohol-related harm.

Epidemiology and alcohol policy in Europe.

Author information:

Psychologie and Psychotherapie, Dresden, Germany. mail: jtrehm@aol.com

AIMS: To describe three aspects of the epidemiology of alcohol-attributable 
deaths in Europe, dose, demography and place, and to illustrate how such 
knowledge can better be used to inform alcohol policy formulation and 
implementation.
DESIGN: epidemiological and population health modeling.
SETTING: Europe.
PARTICIPANTS: Based on country-specific aggregate statistics.
EXPOSURE: country-specific adult per capita consumption triangulated with survey 
data; outcomes: mortality statistics.
FINDINGS: The absolute risk of dying from an alcohol-attributable disease and 
injury (accounting for a protective effect for ischaemic diseases) increases 
with increasing daily alcohol consumption beyond 10 g alcohol per day, the first 
data point. Over 2/3 of all alcohol-attributable deaths occurring amongst the 
20-64 year old population of the European Union (minus Cyprus and Malta) occur 
in the 45-64 year olds. About 25% of the difference in life expectancy between 
western and eastern Europe for men aged 20-64 years in 2002 can be attributed to 
alcohol, largely, but not exclusively, as a result of differences in heavy 
episodic drinking patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Any reduction in the dose of alcohol consumed, at least down to 10 
g/day, will reduce the annual and lifetime risk of an alcohol-related death. 
There is a need for alcohol policy to focus on measures in reducing alcohol 
consumption, throughout middle age, with immediacy of impact. Policy should 
strive to reduce alcohol-related health inequalities, with the specific 
recommendations for policy depending on the cost-effectiveness of interventions 
related to the epidemiological profile of the country or region under 
consideration. Fortunately, there are evidence-based policy options that reduce 
the amount of alcohol consumed and many alcohol-related harms with immediate 
effect, that reduce the risk of an alcohol-related death in middle age, and that 
would help to close the health gap between eastern and western Europe.

Explaining low mortality among US immigrants relative to native-born Americans: 
the role of smoking.

lblue@princeton.edu

BACKGROUND: In many developed countries, immigrants live longer-that is, have 
lower death rates at most or all ages-than native-born residents. This article 
tests whether different levels of smoking-related mortality can explain part of 
the 'healthy immigrant effect' in the USA, as well as part of the related 
'Hispanic paradox': the tendency for US Hispanics to outlive non-Hispanic 
Whites.
METHODS: With data from vital statistics and the national census, we calculate 
lung cancer death rates in 2000 for four US subpopulations: foreign-born, 
native-born, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White. We then use three different 
methods-the Peto-Lopez method, the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth method and a novel 
method developed in this article-to generate three alternative estimates of 
smoking-related mortality for each of the four subpopulations, extrapolating 
from lung cancer death rates. We then measure the contribution of 
smoking-related mortality to disparities in all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Taking estimates from any of the three methods, we find that smoking 
explains >50% of the difference in life expectancy at 50 years between foreign- 
and native-born men, and >70% of the difference between foreign- and native-born 
women; smoking explains >75% of the difference in life expectancy at 50 years 
between US Hispanic and non-Hispanic White men, and close to 75% of the Hispanic 
advantage among women.
CONCLUSIONS: Low smoking-related mortality was the main reason for immigrants' 
and Hispanics' longevity advantage in the USA in 2000.

Comment in
    Int J Epidemiol. 2011 Aug;40(4):1068-70.

BACKGROUND: It is not clear whether recent increases in life expectancy are 
accompanied by a concurrent postponement of activity limitations. The objective 
of this study was to give best estimates of the trend in the prevalence of 
activity limitations among the non-institutionalized population aged 55-84 years 
over the period 1990-2007 in The Netherlands.
METHODS: We examined self-reports on 12 measures of moderate or severe activity 
limitations in stair climbing, walking and getting dressed as assessed by OECD 
long-term disability questionnaire or Short Form-36 (SF-36) items, using 
original data from five population-based cross-sectional and longitudinal 
surveys (n = 54,847 respondents). To account for heterogeneity between surveys, 
we used meta-analyses to study time trends.
RESULTS: Time trends of 10 out of the 12 activity limitation variables studied 
were stable. The prevalence of at least moderate activity limitations in stair 
climbing [odds ratio (OR) = 1.03)] and getting dressed (OR = 1.04) based on OECD 
items increased over the study period. Age- and gender-stratified time trend 
analyses showed consistent patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: No declines were observed in the prevalence of activity limitations 
in the Dutch older population over the period 1990-2007. The increase in life 
expectancy in this period is accompanied by a stable prevalence of most activity 
limitations.

OBJECTIVE: To compare all cause mortality between the north and south of England 
over four decades.
DESIGN: Population wide comparative observational study of mortality.
SETTING: Five northernmost and four southernmost English government office 
regions.
POPULATION: All residents in each year from 1965 to 2008.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death rate ratios of north over south England by age band 
and sex, and northern excess mortality (percentage of excess deaths in north 
compared with south, adjusted for age and sex and examined for annual trends, 
using Poisson regression).
RESULTS: During 1965 to 2008 the northern excess mortality remained substantial, 
at an average of 13.8% (95% confidence interval 13.7% to 13.9%). This 
geographical inequality was significantly larger for males than for females 
(14.9%, 14.7% to 15.0% v 12.7%, 12.6% to 12.9%, P<0.001). The inequality 
decreased significantly but temporarily for both sexes from the early 80s to the 
late 90s, followed by a steep significant increase from 2000 to 2008. Inequality 
varied with age, being higher for ages 0-9 years and 40-74 years and lower for 
ages 10-39 years and over 75 years. Time trends also varied with age. The 
strongest trend over time by age group was the increase among the 20-34 age 
group, from no significant northern excess mortality in 1965-95 to 22.2% (18.7% 
to 26.0%) in 1996-2008. Overall, the north experienced a fifth more premature 
(<75 years) deaths than the south, which was significant: a pattern that changed 
only by a slight increase between 1965 and 2008.
CONCLUSION: Inequalities in all cause mortality in the north-south divide were 
severe and persistent over the four decades from 1965 to 2008. Males were 
affected more than females, and the variation across age groups was substantial. 
The increase in this inequality from 2000 to 2008 was notable and occurred 
despite the public policy emphasis in England over this period on reducing 
inequalities in health.

BACKGROUND: Aspirin reduces myocardial infarction but increases gastrointestinal 
tract (GI) bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce upper GI bleeding. 
We estimate the cost-utility of aspirin treatment with or without a PPI for 
coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention among men at different risks for CHD and 
GI bleeding.
METHODS: We updated a Markov model to compare costs and outcomes of low-dose 
aspirin plus PPI (omeprazole, 20 mg/d), low-dose aspirin alone, or no treatment 
for CHD prevention. We performed lifetime analyses in men with different risks 
for cardiovascular events and GI bleeding. Aspirin reduced nonfatal myocardial 
infarction by 30%, increased total stroke by 6%, and increased GI bleeding risk 
2-fold. Adding a PPI reduced upper GI bleeding by 80%. Annual aspirin cost was 
$13.99; the generic PPI cost was $200.00.
RESULTS: In 45-year-old men with a 10-year CHD risk of 10% and 0.8 per 1000 
annual GI bleeding risk, aspirin ($17,571 and 18.67 quality-adjusted life-years 
[QALYs]) was more effective and less costly than no treatment ($18,483 and 18.44 
QALYs). Compared with aspirin alone, aspirin plus PPI ($21,037 and 18.68 QALYs) 
had an incremental cost per QALY of $447,077. Results were similar in 55- and 
65-year-old men. The incremental cost per QALY of adding a PPI was less than 
$50,000 per QALY at annual GI bleeding probabilities greater than 4 to 6 per 
1000.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with aspirin for CHD prevention is less costly and more 
effective than no treatment in men older than 45 years with greater than 
10-year, 10% CHD risks. Adding a PPI is not cost-effective for men with average 
GI bleeding risk but may be cost-effective for selected men at increased risk 
for GI bleeding.

Sensing of energy and nutrients by AMP-activated protein kinase.

Hardie DG(1).

Author information:
(1)College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, United Kingdom. 
d.g.hardie@dundee.ac.uk

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor that exists in 
almost all eukaryotes. Genetic studies in lower eukaryotes suggest that the 
ancestral role of AMPK was in response to starvation for a carbon source and 
that AMPK is involved in life-span extension in response to caloric restriction. 
In mammals, AMPK is activated by an increasing cellular AMP:ATP ratio (which 
signifies a decrease in energy) caused by metabolic stresses that interfere with 
ATP production (eg, hypoxia) or that accelerate ATP consumption (eg, muscle 
contraction). Because glucose deprivation can increase the AMP:ATP ratio, AMPK 
can also act as a glucose sensor. AMPK activation occurs by a dual mechanism 
that involves allosteric activation and phosphorylation by upstream kinases. 
Once activated, AMPK switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP (eg, the 
uptake and oxidation of glucose and fatty acids and mitochondrial biogenesis) 
while switching off ATP-consuming, anabolic pathways (eg, the synthesis of 
lipids, glucose, glycogen, and proteins). In addition to the acute effects via 
direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, AMPK has longer-term effects by 
regulating transcription. These features make AMPK an ideal drug target in the 
treatment of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 
The antidiabetic drug metformin (which is derived from an herbal remedy) works 
in part by activating AMPK, whereas many xenobiotics or "nutraceuticals," 
including resveratrol, quercetin, and berberine, are also AMPK activators. Most 
of these agents activate AMPK because they inhibit mitochondrial function.

Mutations in growth signaling pathways extend life span, as well as protect 
against age-dependent DNA damage in yeast and decrease insulin resistance and 
cancer in mice. To test their effect in humans, we monitored for 22 years 
Ecuadorian individuals who carry mutations in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) 
gene that lead to severe GHR and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) 
deficiencies. We combined this information with surveys to identify the cause 
and age of death for individuals in this community who died before this period. 
The individuals with GHR deficiency exhibited only one nonlethal malignancy and 
no cases of diabetes, in contrast to a prevalence of 17% for cancer and 5% for 
diabetes in control subjects. A possible explanation for the very low incidence 
of cancer was suggested by in vitro studies: Serum from subjects with GHR 
deficiency reduced DNA breaks but increased apoptosis in human mammary 
epithelial cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. Serum from GHR-deficient 
subjects also caused reduced expression of RAS, PKA (protein kinase A), and TOR 
(target of rapamycin) and up-regulation of SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) in 
treated cells, changes that promote cellular protection and life-span extension 
in model organisms. We also observed reduced insulin concentrations (1.4 μU/ml 
versus 4.4 μU/ml in unaffected relatives) and a very low HOMA-IR (homeostatic 
model assessment-insulin resistance) index (0.34 versus 0.96 in unaffected 
relatives) in individuals with GHR deficiency, indicating higher insulin 
sensitivity, which could explain the absence of diabetes in these subjects. 
These results provide evidence for a role of evolutionarily conserved pathways 
in the control of aging and disease burden in humans.

A multiple comparison approach using whole genome transcriptional arrays was 
used to identify genes and pathways involved in calorie restriction/dietary 
restriction (DR) life span extension in Drosophila. Starting with a gene centric 
analysis comparing the changes in common between DR and two DR related molecular 
genetic life span extending manipulations, Sir2 and p53, lead to a molecular 
confirmation of Sir2 and p53's similarity with DR and the identification of a 
small set of commonly regulated genes. One of the identified upregulated genes, 
takeout, known to be involved in feeding and starvation behavior, and to have 
sequence homology with Juvenile Hormone (JH) binding protein, was shown to 
directly extend life span when specifically overexpressed. Here we show that a 
pathway centric approach can be used to identify shared physiological pathways 
between DR and Sir2, p53 and resveratrol life span extending interventions. The 
set of physiological pathways in common among these life span extending 
interventions provides an initial step toward defining molecular genetic and 
physiological changes important in life span extension. The large overlap in 
shared pathways between DR, Sir2, p53 and resveratrol provide strong molecular 
evidence supporting the genetic studies linking these specific life span 
extending interventions.

BACKGROUND: Effective therapies have increased life expectancy of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pediatric patients. We investigated the 
underlying causes of death, mortality, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) rates in HIV-infected pediatric patients in Madrid, Spain.
METHODS: We studied a multicenter cohort of 478 HIV-infected pediatric patients 
in Madrid. Mortality and AIDS incidence rates, causes of death, CD4 T-cell, and 
HIV RNA were analyzed during calendar periods (CPs): pre-HAART (highly active 
antiretroviral therapy) (CP1: 1982-1996) and post-HAART era (CP2: 1997-2009).
RESULTS: During 5690 person-years of follow-up 157 (32.8%) deaths occurred. 
Median age at death increased (CP1: 3.2 years [1.0-6.3] vs. CP2: 7.7 years 
[3.1-11.4]; P < 0.01). Mortality and AIDS rates decreased 10.6-fold (95% 
confidence intervals [CI]: 6.9-16.7) and 6.9-fold (95% CI: 5.0-9.6), 
respectively, between CPs. Nevertheless, mortality was 10.4-fold (95% CI: 
5.8-18.8; P < 0.001) higher than in age-similar general population in late-CP2. 
In all, 169 causes of death were reported. Multiple causes were reported in 16 
of 151 (10.6%) patients. In 81.1% (137/169), the causes were AIDS-defining, 
11.8% (20/169) HIV-related, and 7.1% (12/169) non-HIV-related. Infections were 
the leading causes (60.8%, 101/166); from 1999 to 2007 the risk of death from 
infections was 115.9 times (95% CI: 42.0-265.8; P < 0.001) higher than in the 
age-similar general population. Comorbidity was reported in 66.9% (101/151) of 
patients. Median HIV-1 RNA at death decreased (CP1: 5.9 [5.0-6.3]; CP2: 5.3 
[4.2-5.8]; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite decline in mortality and AIDS rates, it is important to 
monitor all causes of death as prolonged survival might allow underlying 
comorbidity to become more clinically relevant.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is both a major threat to the life expectancy 
of kidney transplant recipients and an important determinant of late allograft 
loss. Obesity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: We investigated the relation between both pretransplant and 1-year 
posttransplant body mass index (BMI) with patient and renal graft survival in a 
cohort of 1810 adult patients. Sixty-one percent of all patients were men; 
median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 46 years (35-56 years); median (IQR) 
pretransplant BMI was 23.0 kg/m (20.8-25.6 kg/m); 1 year after transplantation, 
the median (IQR) BMI had increased 1.6 kg/m (0.3-3.2 kg/m) and median (IQR) 
follow-up time was 8.3 years (5.3-12.0 years). We categorized BMI as follows: 
less than or equal to 20, more than 20 to less than or equal to 25 (normal), 
more than 25 to less than or equal to 30, and more than 30 (obesity) kg/m.
RESULTS: Using a Cox proportional hazards model, after adjustment for 
cardiovascular risk factors, the relative risks (95% confidence intervals) of 
death and death-censored graft failure during all follow-up for pretransplant 
obesity compared with normal BMI were 1.22 (0.86-1.74) and 1.34 (1.02-1.77), 
respectively; for obesity 1 year after transplantation compared with normal BMI, 
it was 1.39 (1.05-1.86) and 1.39 (1.10-1.74), respectively; and for change in 
BMI (per 5 kg/m increment) during the first year after transplantation, it was 
1.23 (1.01-1.50) and 1.18 (1.01-1.38), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: One year posttransplant BMI and BMI increment are more strongly 
related to death and graft failure than pretransplant BMI among kidney 
transplant recipients. Patients with BMI more than 30 kg/m compared with a 
normal BMI have approximately 20% to 40% higher risk for death and graft 
failure.

Temporal factors in school closure policy for mitigating the spread of 
influenza.

Is school closure effective in mitigating influenza outbreaks? For Singapore, we 
developed an individual-based simulation model using real-life contact data. We 
evaluated the impacts of temporal factors - trigger threshold and duration - on 
the effectiveness of school closure as a mitigation policy. We found an upper 
bound of the duration of school closure, where further extension beyond which 
will not bring additional benefits to suppressing the attack rate and peak 
incidence. For school closure with a relatively short duration (< 6 weeks), it 
is more effective to start closure after a relatively longer delay from the 
first day of infection; if the duration of school closure is long (>6 weeks), 
however, it is better to start it as early as reasonable. Our studies reveal the 
critical importance of timing in school closure, especially in cost-cautious 
situations. Our studies also demonstrate the great potential of a properly 
developed individual-based simulation model in evaluating various disease 
control policies.

Percutaneous options for acute deep vein thrombosis.

Vedantham S(1), Padginton C.

Author information:
(1)Interventional Radiology Section, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, 
Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

Anticoagulant therapy is associated with poor late limb outcomes in many 
patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Because systemic thrombolysis and 
surgical thrombectomy have inherent limitations, image-guided percutaneous 
thrombus removal is currently favored. Pharmacologic thrombolysis is effective 
in removing thrombus, but long-term benefit has not been conclusively 
demonstrated and major bleeding rates appear to be higher than those observed 
with anticoagulation alone. Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is limited as a 
stand-alone DVT treatment method by inability to clear large thrombosed veins 
completely and by pulmonary embolism. Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis represents 
the most promising currently available method to treat DVT. Randomized trials 
with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the appropriate indications for 
these procedures. In the meantime, a highly individualized approach to selection 
of patients is recommended, taking into account the chronicity and anatomic 
extent of DVT, the presence of circulatory compromise, the patient's bleeding 
risk profile, life expectancy, and anticipated activity level.

Improved web-based calculators for predicting breast carcinoma outcomes.

We describe a set of web-based calculators, available at 
http://www.CancerMath.net , which estimate the risk of breast carcinoma death, 
the reduction in life expectancy, and the impact of various adjuvant treatment 
choices. The published SNAP method of the binary biological model of cancer 
metastasis uses information on tumor size, nodal status, and other prognostic 
factors to accurately estimate of breast cancer lethality at 15 years after 
diagnosis. By combining these 15-year lethality estimates with data on the 
breast cancer hazard function, breast cancer lethality can be estimated at each 
of the 15 years after diagnosis. A web-based calculator was then created to 
visualize the estimated lethality with and without a range of adjuvant therapy 
options at any of the 15 years after diagnosis, and enable conditional survival 
calculations. NIH population data was used to estimate non-breast-cancer chance 
of death. The accuracy of the calculators was tested against two large breast 
carcinoma datasets: 7,907 patients seen at two academic hospitals and 362,491 
patients from the SEER national dataset. The calculators were found to be highly 
accurate and specific, as seen by their capacity for stratifying patients into 
groups differing by as little as a 2% risk of death, and accurately accounting 
for nodal status, histology, grade, age, and hormone receptor status. Our breast 
carcinoma calculators provide accurate and useful estimates of the risk of 
death, which can aid in analysis of the various adjuvant therapy options 
available to each patient.

[Palliative sedation largely in accordance with Dutch national guideline].

[Article in Dutch]

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practice of continuous palliative sedation after the 
introduction of a national guideline.
DESIGN: Investigation by questionnaire.
METHOD: In 2008, 1580 physicians were asked to fill out a questionnaire 
regarding the last patient for whom they had prescribed continuous sedation 
until death.
RESULTS: The response was 38% (n = 606). Eighty-two percent of the respondents 
were aware of the national guideline. Dyspnoea, pain and physical exhaustion 
were most often mentioned as the decisive indications for continuous sedation. 
The decision to use sedation was discussed with all mentally competent patients; 
in 18% of these cases, the patients had only been informed of the decision. Life 
expectancy at the start of continuous sedation was estimated to be less than 2 
weeks in 97% of the cases. In 14% of the cases, the physicians felt pressured to 
start the sedation, predominantly by patients and relatives. Physicians were 
present at the start of sedation in 81% of the cases. Midazolam was used to 
induce sedation in 92%, and 41% of the physicians estimated that continuous 
sedation had hastened death to some extent. Most physicians believed that their 
patients' symptoms had been adequately relieved by continuous sedation, that the 
relatives were satisfied and that the quality of dying had been good.
CONCLUSION: Continuous sedation practice in the Netherlands largely reflects the 
recommendations of the national guideline. Issues needing further attention are 
the pressure felt by physicians to start continuous sedation, as well as the 
possible life-shortening effect of continuous sedation as perceived by some of 
the physicians.

Cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine versus NPH insulin for the treatment of 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, modeling the interaction between hypoglycemia and 
glycemic control in Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term and 
long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with insulin glargine or NPH 
insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled 
with oral anti-diabetic drugs in Switzerland, modeling the interaction between 
hypoglycemia and glycemic control (HbA1c).
METHODS: A validated discrete event simulation model for T2DM was used to 
predict incidence of short-term complications (symptomatic, nocturnal and severe 
hypoglycemic events) and long-term complications (microvascular and 
macrovascular events), life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
direct medical costs in patients treated with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. 
The model was populated with published Swiss patient characteristics with T2DM. 
Baseline risks of hypoglycemic events, utility decrements of diabetes-related 
long-term complications and the hypoglycemia fear score were derived from the 
literature. Relative risk reductions of hypoglycemia adjusted for HbA1c using 
insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin were based on a published negative 
binomial meta-regression analysis. Costs of severe hypoglycemia, micro- and 
macrovascular events were analyzed from literature whenever possible otherwise 
guideline-projected resource-use estimations were valued with Swiss official 
prices or tariffs in 2006 CHF. Simulations were run with 1,000 patients per 
cohort over a time horizon of 40 years. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were presented as cost per QALY and per life year gained (LYG). Future 
costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Wide-range one-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Insulin glargine was associated with an improvement in quality of life 
(0.098 QALYs per patient) and additional life expectancy (0.05 life years gained 
per patient) compared to NPH insulin. Incremental costs of CHF 2,578 resulted in 
an ICER of CHF 26,271 per QALY and CHF 51,100 per LYG. The cost per QALY was 
most sensitive to changes in costs, utility decrements and relative risk 
reductions of hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated, for the first time, the cost effectiveness of 
insulin glargine versus NPH insulin for the treatment of T2DM considering the 
interaction between glycemic control and hypoglycemia in Switzerland. The base 
case and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that insulin glargine proved to be 
cost-effective with respect to accepted willingness to pay thresholds and 
therefore represents good value for money.

Managing cystic fibrosis: strategies that increase life expectancy and improve 
quality of life.

Center, Jerusalem, Israel.

The survival of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) continues to improve. The 
discovery and cloning of the CFTR gene more than 21 years ago led to the 
identification of the structure and function of the CFTR chloride channel. New 
therapies based on the understanding of the function of CFTR are currently under 
development. The better clinical status and improved survival of patients with 
CF is not only a result of understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CF but 
also a result of the development of therapeutic strategies that are based on 
insights into the natural course of the disease. Current CF treatments that 
target respiratory infections, inflammation, mucociliary clearance, and 
nutritional status are associated with improved pulmonary function and reduced 
exacerbations. Patients benefit from treatment at a specialized CF center by a 
multidisciplinary dedicated team with emphasis being placed on frequent visits, 
periodic testing, and monitoring adherence to therapy. The purpose of this 
review is to survey recent developments in CF care that are responsible for the 
improved survival and quality of life of patients with CF.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection will probably beneficially impact 
onward transmission and life expectancy. We compared mortality rates and CD4 
cell counts at start of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in patients 
with different frequencies of diagnostic testing for HIV.
METHODS: Patients infected with HIV-1 through sexual contact and in follow-up 
anytime from 2004 through 2008 were selected from the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in 
the Netherlands national observational HIV cohort and stratified into three 
groups: patients without a prior negative HIV antibody test (i.e., with a 
positive first-test result); patients with 1-2 years between the last negative 
and first positive test; and patients with less than 1 year between tests. 
Outcome measures were mortality from 2004 through 2008 and CD4 cell count at 
cART initiation.
RESULTS: Of 5494 patients, the mortality rate was highest among the 4067 
patients with a positive first test (1.33/100 person-years) and the adjusted 
relative risk of mortality was 0.50 in 561 patients with tests 1-2 years apart 
(P = 0.04 compared to patients with a positive first test) and 0.49 (P = 0.02) 
when tests were less than 1 year apart (n = 866). In patients with a positive 
first test, 48% had CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/μl at cART initiation; 
this proportion was 23-26% in the two groups of repeatedly tested patients 
(adjusted odds ratio compared to patients with a positive first test 0.43 and 
0.37, respectively; both P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Frequent repeated testing for HIV may improve the rate of timely 
diagnosis and treatment, thereby preventing disease progression.

PURPOSE: To investigate the utility values associated with visual loss due to 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Japanese patients.
METHODS: Utility values in 48 Japanese patients with bilateral exudative AMD 
were measured using the time trade-off and standard gamble methods.
RESULTS: The time trade-off method utility values correlated with the 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the better-seeing eye. The estimated 
utility values according to the BCVA in the better-seeing eye were 0.534 (BCVA, 
0.01-0.15), 0.574 (0.2-0.3), 0.613 (0.4-0.6), and 0.653 (0.7-1.0). The utility 
values obtained by the standard gamble method were not significantly correlated 
with BCVA in the better-seeing eye.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results concur with those of previous studies showing 
that AMD causes a substantial decrease in patient utility values. The utility 
values obtained in the current study provide important information for use in 
cost-utility analysis of interventions for Japanese AMD patients.
