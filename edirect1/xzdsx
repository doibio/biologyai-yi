BACKGROUND: Data on long-term outcomes following an acute stroke are sparse. We 
assessed survival, risk of recurrent stroke and loss in life expectancy 
following an acute stroke using population-wide data from Australia and New 
Zealand.
METHODS: We included all adults with the first stroke hospitalization during 
2008 and 2017 at all public and most private hospitals. Patients were followed 
up to 10 years after the stroke by linkage to each region's Registry of Deaths 
and subsequent hospitalizations. Flexible parametric survival modeling was used 
to estimate all-cause mortality, stroke recurrence, and loss in life expectancy. 
Competing risk model was used when estimating the risk of stroke recurrence.
RESULTS: Three hundred thirteen thousand one hundred sixty-two patients were 
included (mean age 73.0±14.6 y, 52.0% males) with ischemic stroke (175 547, 
56.1%) being the most common, followed by hemorrhagic stroke (77 940, 24.9%) and 
unspecified stroke (59 675, 19.1%). The overall survival probability was 79.4% 
at 3 months, 73.0% at 1 year, 52.8% at 5 years, and 36.4% at 10 years. 
Cumulative incidence of stroke recurrence was 7.8% at 3 months, 11.0% at 1 year, 
19.8% at 5 years, and 26.8% at 10 years. Hemorrhagic stroke was associated with 
greater mortality (hazard ratio, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.99-2.04]) and recurrent stroke 
(hazard ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.59-1.67]) compared with ischemic stroke. Female 
sex (hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.09-1.11]) and increasing age (≥85 years 
versus 18-54 years: hazard ratio, 7.36 [95% CI, 7.15-7.57]) were also associated 
with increased mortality. Several risk factors including atherosclerotic 
coronary and noncoronary vascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and diabetes were 
associated with increased risk of mortality and recurrent stroke. Compared with 
the general population, an acute stroke was associated with a loss of 5.5 years 
of life expectancy, or 32.7% of the predicted life expectancy, and was 
pronounced in patients with a hemorrhagic stroke (7.4 years and 38.5% of 
predicted life expectancy lost).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-wide study, death and recurrence of stroke were 
common after an acute stroke and an acute stroke was associated with 
considerable loss in life expectancy. Further improvements in treatment and 
secondary prevention of stroke are needed to reduce these risks.

Objectives: The goal of this study was to compare cost-effectiveness of 
sacubitril/valsartan with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for 
treating chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) 
from the published articles and explore the methodology applied in the studies. 
Methods: Systematic research was conducted in February 2021 using PubMed, 
Cochrane, and EBSCO. A combination of MeSH terms of "cost-effectiveness 
analysis," "heart failure with reduced ejection fraction," "sacubitril 
valsartan," and "angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor" was employed. The 
review selected for articles published in the last five years in English. 
Results: A total of 15 studies were included in this review. We found that these 
studies had been conducted in 12 different countries. The United States had the 
greatest number of publications (5), followed by the Netherlands (2). The study 
method most used was the Markov decision model (73%). Almost all studies 
produced ICERs and QALYs that were numerically high. Conclusions: The use of 
sacubitril/valsartan associates with longer life expectancy and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: In the international, randomized, open-label, phase III study SOPHIA 
trial, margetuximab plus chemotherapy showed improved progression-free survival 
(PFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. 
This study aimed to investigate whether margetuximab plus chemotherapy is 
cost-effective compared with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in pretreated 
patients with ERBB2-positive advanced breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data for this model was derived from the 
SOPHIA trial. Costs and utility were either derived from the standard fee 
database or extracted from previously published literature. A three-state Markov 
model was developed to simulate the disease process of patients with advanced 
breast cancer. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the 
impact of variables in the analysis model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
was performed based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations. A subgroup analysis was 
performed to test whether margetuximab is cost-effective in CD16A-158F allele 
carriers.
RESULTS: Margetuximab plus chemotherapy provided an incremental 0.04 QALYs with 
an incremental cost of $66,109.78, compared with the trastuzumab plus 
chemotherapy, resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$1,486,442.35/QALY, which exceeded the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold. While 
in the CD16A-158F allele carriers subgroup, the ICER decreased to 
$592,669.73/QALY. The variance of the utility of PFS state, costs of 
margetuximab, and utility of progressive disease state were the most influential 
factors in the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Under current WTP threshold, margetuximab plus chemotherapy is not 
cost-effective compared with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in pretreated 
patients with ERBB2-positive advanced breast cancer. Selecting CD16A-158F allele 
carriers might be a considerable option to optimize the cost-effectiveness of 
margetuximab.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of lifestyle factors on life expectancy lived 
with and without Alzheimer's dementia.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Chicago Health and Aging Project, a population based cohort study 
in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: 2449 men and women aged 65 years and older.
MAIN EXPOSURE: A healthy lifestyle score was developed based on five modifiable 
lifestyle factors: a diet for brain health (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention 
for Neurodegenerative Delay-MIND diet score in upper 40% of cohort 
distribution), late life cognitive activities (composite score in upper 40%), 
moderate or vigorous physical activity (≥150 min/week), no smoking, and light to 
moderate alcohol consumption (women 1-15 g/day; men 1-30 g/day).
MAIN OUTCOME: Life expectancy with and without Alzheimer's dementia in women and 
men.
RESULTS: Women aged 65 with four or five healthy factors had a life expectancy 
of 24.2 years (95% confidence interval 22.8 to 25.5) and lived 3.1 years longer 
than women aged 65 with zero or one healthy factor (life expectancy 21.1 years, 
19.5 to 22.4). Of the total life expectancy at age 65, women with four or five 
healthy factors spent 10.8% (2.6 years, 2.0 to 3.3) of their remaining years 
with Alzheimer's dementia, whereas women with zero or one healthy factor spent 
19.3% (4.1 years, 3.2 to 5.1) with the disease. Life expectancy for women aged 
65 without Alzheimer's dementia and four or five healthy factors was 21.5 years 
(20.0 to 22.7), and for those with zero or one healthy factor it was 17.0 years 
(15.5 to 18.3). Men aged 65 with four or five healthy factors had a total life 
expectancy of 23.1 years (21.4 to 25.6), which is 5.7 years longer than men aged 
65 with zero or one healthy factor (life expectancy 17.4 years, 15.8 to 20.1). 
Of the total life expectancy at age 65, men with four or five healthy factors 
spent 6.1% (1.4 years, 0.3 to 2.0) of their remaining years with Alzheimer's 
dementia, and those with zero or one healthy factor spent 12.0% (2.1 years, 0.2 
to 3.0) with the disease. Life expectancy for men aged 65 without Alzheimer's 
dementia and four or five healthy factors was 21.7 years (19.7 to 24.9), and for 
those with zero or one healthy factor life expectancy was 15.3 years (13.4 to 
19.1).
CONCLUSION: A healthy lifestyle was associated with a longer life expectancy 
among men and women, and they lived a larger proportion of their remaining years 
without Alzheimer's dementia. The life expectancy estimates might help health 
professionals, policy makers, and stakeholders to plan future healthcare 
services, costs, and needs.

PURPOSE: Acute aortic syndrome is a constellation of life-threatening medical 
conditions for which rapid assessment and targeted intervention are important 
for the prognosis of patients who are at high risk of in-hospital death. The 
current study aims to develop and externally validate an early prediction 
mortality model that can be used to identify high-risk patients with acute 
aortic syndrome in the emergency department.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective multi-center observational study 
enrolled 1088 patients with acute aortic syndrome admitted to the emergency 
departments of two hospitals in China between January 2017 and March 2021 for 
model development. A total of 210 patients with acute aortic syndrome admitted 
to the emergency departments of Peking University Third Hospital between January 
2007 and December 2021 was enrolled for model validation. Demographics and 
clinical factors were collected at the time of emergency department admission. 
The predictive variables were determined by referring to the results of previous 
studies and the baseline analysis of this study. The study's endpoint was 
in-hospital death. To assess internal validity, we used a fivefold 
cross-validation method. Model performance was validated internally and 
externally by evaluating model discrimination using the area under the 
receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). A nomogram was developed based on 
the binary regression results.
RESULTS: In the development cohort, 1088 patients with acute aortic syndromes 
were included, and 88 (8.1%) patients died during hospitalization. In the 
validation cohort, 210 patients were included, and 20 (9.5%) patients died 
during hospitalization. The final model included the following variables: 
digestive system symptoms (OR=2.25; P=0.024), any pulse deficit (OR=7.78; 
P<0.001), creatinine (µmol/L)(OR=1.00; P=0.018), lesion extension to iliac 
vessels (OR=4.49; P<0.001), pericardial effusion (OR=2.67; P=0.008), and 
Stanford type A (OR=10.46; P<0.001). The model's AUC was 0.838 (95% CI 
0.784-0.892) in the development cohort and 0.821 (95% CI 0.750-0.891) in the 
validation cohort, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed p=0.597. The fivefold 
cross-validation demonstrated a mean accuracy of 0.94, a mean precision of 0.67, 
and a mean recall of 0.13.
CONCLUSION: This risk prediction tool uses simple variables to provide robust 
prediction of the risk of in-hospital death from acute aortic syndrome and 
validated well in an independent cohort. The tool can help emergency clinicians 
quickly identify high-risk acute aortic syndrome patients, although further 
studies are needed for verifying the prospective data and the results of our 
study.

OBJECTIVE: Residual cognitive symptoms after depression are common and 
associated with reduced daily life functioning and an increased risk of 
depression relapse. There is a lack of knowledge on treatments targeting 
residual cognitive symptoms after major depressive disorder (MDD), including the 
factors associated with treatment response. The aim of the current study is to 
explore factors of treatment response to a guided internet-delivered 
intervention for former depressed adults experiencing residual cognitive 
symptoms.
METHOD: Forty-three former depressed adults with residual cognitive symptoms 
were included. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the impact 
of pre-treatment demographic-, illness, and symptom variables, and therapy 
process variables, such as credibility, expectancy, and user behavior, on 
reduction in residual cognitive symptoms from pre-treatment to 6-month 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Having had MDD for a year or less predicted more reductions in residual 
cognitive symptoms from pre- to 6-month follow-up. Higher levels of perceived 
treatment credibility and expectancy evaluated in the early course of treatment 
did also predict a positive treatment response. No demographic-, 
symptom-variables, previous number of episodes with MDD, and user behavior were 
associated with change in residual cognitive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that individuals with shorter duration of 
previous depressions might have larger reductions in residual cognitive symptoms 
at 6-month follow-up compared to those with a longer duration of depression. 
Treatment credibility and expectancy also predicted treatment response and 
effort should also be made to ensure interventions credibility. Results should 
be interpreted with caution due to the study having a low sample size. Further 
investigation of predictors should be conducted in a full scale randomized 
controlled trial.

Gains in life expectancy have recently slowed and mortality inequalities have 
increased. This paper examines whether trends in health observed at ages 55 to 
89 mirror those trends in mortality, which may serve as an early indicator for 
the future evolution of mortality. We found that many health outcomes have 
worsened from 1992 to 2016, especially at ages below 70, and that differentials 
in health between low and high education groups have increased among the more 
recent cohorts. Overall the findings cast a pessimistic light on the future 
evolution of mortality rates and mortality inequalities.

Despite increased life expectancy, mortality rates among women infected with HIV 
are 3-15 times higher than those in the overall population, HIV-infected women 
are also excessively affected by HPV and have increased risks of HPV-associated 
developments. This study's objective is to examine the relation between the ART 
treatment, CD4 levels, Pap, HPV and VIA tests with p16 detection among 
HIV-infected women. The data used in this study was collected by survey 
questionnaire instruments in 2009 in Kenya. Descriptive and explanatory 
statistics using frequency and chi-square/fisher's exact tests were performed 
for analysis using SAS-software. The data was stratified by age groups (30-39, 
40-49, and 50 years and older). 75.28% of single HIV-positive women between the 
ages 30-39 participated significantly in the study, with a p-value of <0.0001. 
52.24% of HIV-positive women 30-39 years old were most likely to receive ART 
treatment for less than two years by a margin of 11.2% compared to those who 
received the treatment for more than two years and those who were off treatment 
by a margin of 2.24% (p-value of 0.03). The HIV-positive women 30-39 years old 
had lower CD4 counts of less than 350 cells/μl (44%) and higher CD4 counts of 
500 cells/μl or higher (46.64%). 45.3% of the HIV-positive women 30-39 years old 
were more likely to have positive VIA tests with a p-value of 0.05. 65.87% of 
HIV-positive women 30-39 years old were most likely to have positive VIA tests 
with a p-value of <0.05. HIV-positive women 30-39 years old were most likely to 
have high-risk HPV compared to their older counterparts. This study shows that 
incorporating screening strategies (Pap tests, VIA tests and HPV genotyping) in 
conjunction with ART treatment were more effective in preventing cervical cancer 
in HIV-positive young women 30-39 years old.

Methodological Challenges in Estimating the Lifetime Medical Care Cost 
Externality of Obesity.

There is a great deal of variability in estimates of the lifetime medical care 
cost externality of obesity, partly due to a lack of transparency in the 
methodology behind these cost models. Several important factors must be 
considered in producing the best possible estimate, including age-related weight 
gain, differential life expectancy, identifiability, and cost model selection. 
In particular, age-related weight gain represents an important new component to 
recent cost estimates. Without accounting for age-related weight gain, a study 
relies on the untenable assumption that people remain the same weight throughout 
their lives, leading to a fundamental misunderstanding of the evolution and 
development of the obesity crisis. This study seeks to inform future researchers 
on the best methods and data available both to estimate age-related weight gain 
and to accurately and consistently estimate obesity's lifetime external medical 
care costs. This should help both to create a more standardized approach to cost 
estimation as well as encourage more transparency between all parties interested 
in the question of obesity's lifetime cost and, ultimately, evaluating the 
benefits and costs of interventions targeting obesity at various points in the 
life course.

Population aging is getting enlarged in the upcoming decades. Meanwhile, 
old-aged longevity and dependency are getting large due to improvement in life 
expectancy. In literature, it is claimed that old-aged dependency affects the 
wellbeing of society. Thus, the study intends to explore the impact of 
population aging on human wellbeing. The study adopts the Autoregressive 
Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach for empirical analysis by using time-series 
series data from 1990 to 2020. The study findings reveal that an increase in 
population aging reports a significant and decreasing impact on human wellbeing. 
However, an increase in health expenditure reports a significant and increasing 
impact on human wellbeing. Thus, China must pay attention to population aging to 
improve human health.

INTRODUCTION: Face coverings and distancing as preventative measures against the 
spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 may impact communication in several ways 
that may disproportionately affect people with hearing loss. A scoping review 
was conducted to examine existing literature on the impact of preventative 
measures on communication and to characterize the clinical implications.
METHOD: A systematic search of three electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, 
CINAHL) was conducted yielding 2,158 articles. After removing duplicates and 
screening to determine inclusion eligibility, key data were extracted from the 
50 included articles. Findings are reported following the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping 
Reviews, including the PRISMA-ScR checklist.
RESULTS: Studies fell into three categories: Studies addressing the impacts of 
personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or distancing on communication in 
healthcare contexts (n = 20); studies examining the impact of preventative 
measures on communication in everyday life (n = 13), and studies measuring the 
impact of face coverings on speech using acoustic and/or behavioral measures (n 
= 29). The review revealed that masks disrupt verbal and non-verbal 
communication, as well as emotional and social wellbeing and they impact people 
with hearing loss more than those without. These findings are presumably because 
opaque masks attenuate sound at frequencies above 1 kHz, and conceal the mouth 
and lips making lipreading impossible, and limit visibility of facial 
expressions. While surgical masks cause relatively little sound attenuation, 
transparent masks and face shields are highly attenuating. However, they are 
preferred by people with hearing loss because they give access to visual cues.
CONCLUSION: Face coverings and social distancing has detrimental effects that 
extend well beyond verbal and non-verbal communication, by affecting wellbeing 
and quality of life. As these measures will likely be part of everyday life for 
the foreseeable future, we propose that it is necessary to support effective 
communication, especially in healthcare settings and for people with hearing 
loss.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes-related medication errors are frequently reported 
from the hospitals and consequently are of major concern. However, such reports 
are insufficient when developing healthcare settings are pursued in literature. 
Keeping this inadequacy in mind, we therefore aimed to explore physicians' 
perceptions, experiences and expectations of medication errors when managing 
patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
METHODS: A qualitative design was adopted. By using a semi-structured interview 
guide through the phenomenology-based approach, in-depth, face-to-face 
interviews were conducted. Physicians practicing at the medicine ward of 
Sandeman Provincial Hospital, Quetta, were purposively approached for the study. 
All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and were then analyzed 
for thematic contents by the standard content analysis framework.
RESULTS: Although the saturation was reached at the 13th interview, we conducted 
additional two interviews to ensure the saturation. Fifteen physicians were 
interviewed, and thematic content analysis revealed six themes and nine 
subthemes. Mixed conceptualization and characterization of medication errors 
were identified. Medication errors were encountered by all physicians however 
poor understanding of the system, deficiency of logistics and materials were 
rated as barriers in reporting medication errors. Among contributors of 
medication errors, physicians themselves as well as dispensing and 
patient-related factors were identified. Physicians suggested targeted training 
sessions on medication error-related guidelines and reporting system. Parallel, 
establishment of an independent unit, involving the pharmacists, and strict 
supervision of paramedics to minimize medication errors was also acknowledged 
during data analysis.
CONCLUSION: With a longer life expectancy and a trend of growing population, the 
incidences of medication errors are also expected to increase. Our study 
highlighted prescribing, dispensing and administration phases as contributing 
factors of medication errors. Although, physicians had poor understanding of 
medication errors and reporting system, they believed getting insights on 
guidelines and reporting system is essential. A review of admission and 
discharge reconciliation must be prioritized and a culture of teamwork, 
communication and learning from mistakes is needed.

Long-term survival after lung transplantation has dramatically increased over 
recent years. But it still falls short of providing a solid extended life 
expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years. Patients and their families have to 
informed about this observation so that they can make informed descisions.

INTRODUCTION: The choice between a mechanical versus a bioprosthetic valve in 
aortic valve replacement (AVR) is based on life expectancy, bleeding risk and 
comorbidities, since bioprosthetic AVR (bAVR) are associated with a more rapid 
structural deterioration compared to mechanical AVR (mAVR). The impact of 
widespread transcatheter valve replacements, on the decision to use bAVR versus 
mAVR, in the contemporary era and subsequent outcomes remain to be determined.
METHODS: The National Inpatient database (2009-2018) was used to study trends in 
admissions for bAVR and mAVR and in-hospital mortality and outcomes over time. 
Survey estimation commands were used to determine weighted national estimates.
RESULTS: There were 700,896 ± 18,285 inpatient visits for AVR with 70.1% (95% CI 
69.2%-71.1%) and 29.9% (95% CI 28.9%-30.8%) visits for bAVR and mAVR, 
respectively. Those undergoing bAVR were significantly older (bAVR [69.8 years] 
vs. mAVR [62.7 years] p < .001]. The rates of mAVR decreased across all age 
groups during the study period (ptrend  < .001), including patients ≤50 years 
(ptrend  < .001). In-hospital mortality for mAVR recipients was higher, both 
after multivariable adjustment (OR 1.35 95% CI 1.26-1.45 p < .001) and 
propensity matching (mean difference 0.846% ± 0.19%).
CONCLUSION: In the contemporary era, the utilization of mAVR has decreased 
across all age groups, including those younger than 50 years old. Although mAVR 
recipients were healthier with less comorbidities, inpatient mortality was 
higher after mAVR compared to bAVR. In addition to understanding causes for 
higher in-hospital mortality after mAVR, future research should focus on 
developing transcatheter valve replacement friendly bAVR.
