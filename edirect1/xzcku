Three-dimensional age-specific mortality trajectory features the rate of aging 
and risk for mortality of a population with respect to time (t) and age (x). 
Demographic and clinical records of patients are key elements to the assessment 
of interventional outcomes during survival analysis. Herein, a step-by-step 
protocol shows the retrieval of parametric estimations from both conventional 
and modified maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine mortality 
trajectory of hematopoietic stem cells transplant (HSCT) patients characterized 
by their treatment type.

BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 
abaloparatide (ABL) for treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis 
(PMO) at high risk of fracture. With increasing health care spending and drug 
prices, it is important to quantify the value of newly available treatment 
options for PMO.
OBJECTIVE: To determine cost-effectiveness of ABL compared with teriparatide 
(TPTD) for treatment of women with PMO in the United States.
METHODS: A discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed to assess 
cost-effectiveness of ABL from the US health care perspective. The model 
included three 18-month treatment strategies with either placebo (PBO), TPTD, or 
ABL, all followed by additional 5-year treatment with alendronate (ALN). 
High-risk patients were defined as women with PMO ⩾65 years old with a prior 
vertebral fracture. Baseline clinical event rates, risk reductions, and patient 
characteristics were based on the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral 
Endpoints (ACTIVE) trial.
RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, the DES model yielded average total discounted 
per-patient costs of $10 212, $46 783, and $26 837 and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) of 6.742, 6.781, and 6.792 for PBO/ALN, TPTD/ALN, and 
ABL/ALN, respectively. Compared with TPTD/ALN, ABL/ALN accrued higher QALYs at 
lower cost and produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $333 
266/QALY relative to PBO/ALN. In high-risk women, ABL/ALN also had more QALYs 
and less cost over TPTD/ALN and yielded an ICER of $188 891/QALY relative to 
PBO/ALN. Conclusion and Relevance: ABL is a dominant treatment strategy over 
TPTD. In women with PMO at high risk of fracture, ABL is an alternative 
cost-effective treatment.

[MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY AND OPTIMAL PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT FOR ELDERLY 
SURGICAL PATIENTS].

[Article in Japanese]

Yanaga K.

As a result of increasing life expectancy, the incidence of cancer diagnosed in 
the older population is rising. The therapeutic strategies for elderly patients 
are generally difficult to determine due to comorbidity, functional status, and 
socioeconomic aspects. For esophageal cancer, strict operative indications as 
well as advances in perioperative management have resulted in marked improvement 
of surgical outcomes after esophagectomy even in elderly patients. Laparoscopic 
surgery for gastric cancer and colorectal cancer spread rapidly throughout 
Japan, and reasonable surgical outcomes have been reported in the elderly. In 
future, objective assessments of the surgical stress of treatment will be 
essential. Furthermore, clinical research based on geriatric assessment scores 
are warranted for elderly patients with gastrointestinal cancers.

BACKGROUND: Considering the demographic trend, characterized by a marked aging 
due to the increase in life expectancy and the improvement in medical care, in 
the next future elderly patients will represent the majority of stroke victims 
with a strong impact on rehabilitative services.
AIM: To investigate and characterize differences in functional outcome in 
elderly patients after stroke.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Post-acute inpatient rehabilitation.
POPULATION: Subjects aged ≥65 years with acute (i.e. within 30 days from onset) 
ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
METHODS: At admission, all patients underwent neurological and clinical 
examination, functional evaluation and laboratory assessment. Comorbidities and 
clinical complications during hospital stay were recorded. Functional status was 
evaluated by means of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) administered at 
admission and discharge. All patients underwent neuromotor rehabilitation, and 
speech therapy in case of aphasia, once a day, six days per week.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 402 patients, who were stratified in three groups 
according to age: 145 patients in Group 1, the young-old (65-74.9 years, G1), 
206 in Group 2, the middle-old (75-84.9 years, G2) and 51 in Group 3, the 
oldest-old (≥85 years, G3). At discharge, FIM total scores increased 
significantly for all the groups (P<0.001); however FIM gains, as well as the 
efficiency parameters derived from FIM were significantly lower in G3 when 
compared with G1 and G2. G3 showed a significantly higher rate of comorbidities 
and a higher presence of pressure sores; infections occurred mainly in G2 and 
G3. Hospitalization was significantly longer for G1 and G2 with respect to G3, 
while mortality rates were significantly higher in G2 and G3 with respect to G1. 
The variables that predicted functional outcome were age, previous stroke, 
stroke severity and functional status at admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite advancing age seems to be associated with a reduced 
effectiveness of the rehabilitation process and a greater number of 
complications, intensive rehabilitation can produce significant functional gains 
for all stroke survivors, regardless of age.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Understanding the specificity of this population 
will offer older subjects targeted interventions and, for health systems, better 
allocation of resources and the development of more effective approaches.

AIMS: Patients with heart failure are at increased risk of hyperkalemia, 
particularly when treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor 
(RAASi) agents. This study developed a model to quantify the potential health 
and economic value associated with sustained potassium management and optimal 
RAASi therapy in heart failure patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient-level, fixed-time increment stochastic 
simulation model was designed to characterize the progression of heart failure 
through New York Heart Association functional classes, and predict associations 
between serum potassium levels, RAASi use, and consequent long-term outcomes. 
Following internal and external validation exercises, model analyses sought to 
quantify the health and economic benefits of optimizing both serum potassium 
levels and RAASi therapy in heart failure patients. Analyses were conducted 
using a UK payer perspective, independent of costs and utilities related to 
pharmacological potassium management.
RESULTS: Validation against multiple datasets demonstrated the predictive 
capability of the model. Compared to those who discontinued RAASi to manage 
serum potassium, patients with normokalemia and ongoing RAASi therapy benefited 
from longer life expectancy (+1.38 years), per-patient quality-adjusted life 
year gains (+0.53 QALYs), cost savings (£110), and associated net monetary 
benefit (£10,679 at £20,000 per QALY gained) over a lifetime horizon. The 
predicted value of sustained potassium management and ongoing RAASi treatment 
was largely driven by reduced mortality and hospitalization risks associated 
with optimal RAASi therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Several modeling assumptions were made to account for a current 
paucity of published literature; however, ongoing refinement and validation of 
the model will ensure its continued accuracy as the clinical landscape of 
hyperkalemia evolves.
CONCLUSIONS: Predictions generated by this novel modeling approach highlight the 
value of sustained potassium management to avoid hyperkalemia, enable RAASi 
therapy, and improve long-term health economic outcomes in patients with heart 
failure.

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disorder with limited treatment 
options and reduced life expectancy after diagnosis. Complex genetic backgrounds 
in PAH complicates identification of causative mutations that is essential for 
an understanding of the disease diagnostics and etiology especially for 
idiopathic PAH (iPAH). Hemolysis has been implicated as contributing to the 
pathobiology of PAH. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) expression and 
activity define erythrocyte's antioxidant capacity, and its decrease contributes 
to erythrocyte fragility. As G6PD deficiency was previously reported in a 
limited number of PAH cases, we tested whether iPAH patients exhibit underlying 
G6PD alterations in erythrocytes. A cohort of 22 PAH patients and 8 non-PAH 
patients were recruited for this study. DNA isolated from Peripheral Blood 
Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) was used for detection of mutations in the coding 
region of the G6PD gene. RNA isolated from PBMC was used for determination of 
G6PD mRNA expression level. G6PD activity was measured in Red Blood Cell (RBC) 
pellets. Three patients had missense mutations in G6PD (Val291Met, Asn126Asp, 
Asp194Glu), however, only one mutation (Val291Met) results in a severe G6PD 
deficiency. A single patient with mutation (Asn126Asp) showed a 21% decrease in 
G6PD activity, two subjects showed G6PD deficiency without mutations, and one 
patient had a decreased level of G6PD mRNA and reduced enzyme levels. This study 
demonstrates that a moderate decrease in G6PD activity is associated with PAH. 
Screening for G6PD activity and mutations in the G6PD gene may provide early 
detection of individuals predisposed to PAH.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of a multifactorial, 
tailored intervention to reduce falls among a heterogeneous group of high-risk 
elderly people.
DESIGN: Randomized control trial.
SETTINGS: Communities.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged at least 65 years (N=354) seen at the emergency 
department (ED) for a fall or fall-related injury and discharged home.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received a tailored program of physical 
therapy focused on progressive training in strength, balance, and gait for a 
period of 3 months. They also received screening and referrals for low vision, 
polypharmacy, and environmental hazards. The Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB) test was assessed at regular intervals to allocate participants into 
either a home-based or group center-based program. The control group received 
usual care prescribed by a physician and educational materials on falls 
prevention.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over the 
9-month study period based on intervention costs and utility in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated from EuroQol-5D scores.
RESULTS: The ICER was 120,667 Singapore dollars (S$) per QALY gained 
(S$362/0.003 QALYs), above benchmark values (S$70,000). However, the 
intervention was more effective and cost-saving among those with SPPB scores of 
greater than 6 at baseline, higher cognitive function, better vision and no more 
than 1 fall in the preceding 6 months. The intervention was also cost-effective 
among those with 0-1 critical comorbidities (S$22,646/QALY).
CONCLUSION: The intervention was, overall, not cost-effective, compared to usual 
care. However, the program was cost-effective among healthier subgroups, and 
even potentially cost-saving among individuals with sufficient reserve to 
benefit.

Recombinant interferon-α (rIFN-α) has been widely used for treating viral 
infections. However, the clinical efficacy of unmodified rIFN-α is limited due 
to small molecular size and rapid clearance from circulation. In this study we 
developed a novel strategy for half-life extension of porcine IFN-α (PoIFN-α) by 
fusion to the immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding C2 domain of streptococcal protein G 
(SPG). The coding sequences for PoIFN-α6 and SPG C2 domain, with a tobacco etch 
virus (TEV) protease recognition sequence introduced at the 5-end, were cloned 
into an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fusion expression vector and expressed as 
an ELP-PoIFNα-C2 fusion protein. After optimization of the conditions for 
soluble protein expression and purification, the fusion protein was purified to 
more than 90% purity by two rounds of inverse transition cycling (ITC) in the 
presence of 0.5% Triton X-100. After cleavage with self-aggregating peptide 
ELK-16-tagged tobacco etch virus protease, the protease was removed by quick 
centrifugation and PoIFNα-C2 protein was recovered by an additional round of ITC 
with 98% purity. Western blotting analysis showed that PoIFNα-C2 protein had the 
specific affinity for pig IgG binding. The antiviral assay showed that PoIFNα-C2 
protein had potent antiviral activities against vesicular stomatitis virus and 
porcine pseudorabies virus. After single intravenous or subcutaneous injection 
into rats, PoIFNα-C2 protein showed 16- or 4-fold increase in serum half-life 
with significantly improved bioavailability.

Population ageing, which has come about through the combination of increases in 
life expectancy, larger post-war cohorts reaching older age and reductions in 
fertility, is challenging societies and particularly health and care providers, 
worldwide. In Europe, the USA and Japan, there have been increases in years 
spent with disability and dependency. The majority of such research, as well as 
professional health and social care practice, measures loss of functional 
capability or need for social care, by aggregate disability scores, based around 
activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Although 
useful for defining whether an individual has passed a threshold, aggregate 
scores obscure how functional decline unfolds, and therefore where early 
intervention might improve intrinsic capacity and reverse or slow down decline, 
or maintain function. We propose a framework, the compression of functional 
decline (CFD), based on the latest understanding of the hierarchy of age-related 
functional decline, which has the potential to (i) help people understand how to 
live better for longer, (ii) allow the various stakeholders to be able to 
measure, at a population level, whether that is happening and (iii) identify 
which interventions are most effective at which stages. CFD is coherent with the 
World Health Organisation's Healthy Ageing model and is more easily understood 
by stakeholders and older people themselves, than current indicators such as 
frailty. CFD thus provides a realistic view of age-related functional decline in 
the context of modifiable behaviour to counter widespread public misconceptions 
about ageing and inform improvements.

Rotifers are microinvertebrate models to study the phylogenetically based 
mechanisms of aging. Our study aimed to develop a physiological system with 
electron deprivation via a chemical electron carrier/acceptor pair together with 
extreme caloric restriction (ECR). Middle-aged Philodina acuticornis rotifers 
were treated with combinations of phenazine methosulfate (PMS, electron carrier) 
and 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide 
inner salt (XTT, electron acceptor) for a period of 72 hours under total food 
deprivation (preselection). The ability of XTT to be reduced was confirmed both 
in vitro (with NADH) and in vivo (with live rotifers). Subsequently, the 
respective electron acceptor alone at a lower dose was administered in 
combination with ECR for several months on preselected survivors. We found that 
the longevity of rotifers markedly increased (4×) after PMS/XTT/total food 
deprivation preselection followed by XTT/ECR treatment. Ascorbic acid in 
equivalent concentrations caused similar but less pronounced tendencies. The 
synergistic effect of chemical electron deprivation and ECR caused delayed aging 
and the development of an outstanding phenotype that we refer to as "super 
rotifers," characterized by increased longevity and retained reproductive 
ability compared with normal middle-aged individuals. The presented model 
provides new insights into the connection between redox modulation and 
age-related features in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer in UK women and can 
be difficult to diagnose, particularly in the early stages. Risk-scoring can 
help to guide referral to specialist centres.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of risk scores to 
guide referral decisions for women with suspected ovarian cancer in secondary 
care.
METHODS: Twenty-one databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched from 
inception to November 2016. Review methods followed published guidelines. The 
meta-analysis using weighted averages and random-effects modelling was used to 
estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). The cost-effectiveness analysis considered the long-term costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with different risk-scoring 
methods, and subsequent care pathways. Modelling comprised a decision tree and a 
Markov model. The decision tree was used to model short-term outcomes and the 
Markov model was used to estimate the long-term costs and QALYs associated with 
treatment and progression.
RESULTS: Fifty-one diagnostic cohort studies were included in the systematic 
review. The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) score did not offer any 
advantage over the Risk of Malignancy Index 1 (RMI 1). Patients with borderline 
tumours or non-ovarian primaries appeared to account for disproportionately high 
numbers of false-negative, low-risk ROMA scores. (Confidential information has 
been removed.) To achieve similar levels of sensitivity to the Assessment of 
Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model and the International Ovarian 
Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group's simple ultrasound rules, a very low RMI 1 
decision threshold (25) would be needed; the summary sensitivity and specificity 
estimates for the RMI 1 at this threshold were 94.9% (95% CI 91.5% to 97.2%) and 
51.1% (95% CI 47.0% to 55.2%), respectively. In the base-case analysis, RMI 1 
(threshold of 250) was the least effective [16.926 life-years (LYs), 13.820 
QALYs] and the second cheapest (£5669). The IOTA group's simple ultrasound rules 
(inconclusive, assumed to be malignant) were the cheapest (£5667) and the second 
most effective [16.954 LYs, 13.841 QALYs], dominating RMI 1. The ADNEX model 
(threshold of 10%), costing £5699, was the most effective (16.957 LYs, 13.843 
QALYs), and compared with the IOTA group's simple ultrasound rules, resulted in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £15,304 per QALY gained. At 
thresholds of up to £15,304 per QALY gained, the IOTA group's simple ultrasound 
rules are cost-effective; the ADNEX model (threshold of 10%) is cost-effective 
for higher thresholds.
LIMITATIONS: Information on the downstream clinical consequences of risk-scoring 
was limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the ADNEX model and the IOTA group's simple ultrasound rules 
may offer increased sensitivity relative to current practice (RMI 1); that is, 
more women with malignant tumours would be referred to a specialist 
multidisciplinary team, although more women with benign tumours would also be 
referred. The cost-effectiveness model supports prioritisation of sensitivity 
over specificity. Further research is needed on the clinical consequences of 
risk-scoring.

This study evaluated the antimicrobial effects of tea polyphenols (TP) on 
changes in microbiota composition and quality attributes in silver carp fillets 
stored at 4 °C. During storage, TP treatment was found to be effective in 
enhancing sensory quality, inhibiting microbial growth, and attenuating chemical 
quality deterioration. Meanwhile, the composition of microbiota of silver carp 
fillets was investigated using culture-dependent and culture-independent 
methods. Initially, compared to the control, TP obviously decreased the relative 
abundance of Aeromonas, which allowed Acinetobacter and Methylobacterium to 
become the dominant microbiota in TP treated fillets on day 0. The controls, 
0.5% TP-treated fillets, and 1% TP-treated fillets were rejected by sensory 
panelists on days 8, 12, and 12, respectively. At the time of sensory rejection, 
Aeromonas, followed by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, became the main spoilers 
in the control on day 8. However, TP treatment inhibited the growth of Aeromonas 
and Acinetobacter significantly. Consequently, Aeromonas followed by Pseudomonas 
and Shewanella became the predominant microbiota in all TP-treated fillets on 
day 12. Therefore, TP improved the quality of fillets during chilled storage, 
which was mainly due to their modulating effects on microbiota that resulted in 
the change in pattern and process of spoilage in fillets.

Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is the most common extra thyroidal complication of 
Graves' disease (GD) and occurs predominantly in women but more severe in men. 
The reason for this effect of gender on GO is unknown. Herein we studied the 
manifestation of GO in both sexes of an induced mouse model in absence of 
additional risk factors present in patients like advanced age, genetic 
variabilities or smoking. Male and female mice were immunized with human TSHR 
A-subunit encoding plasmid. Both sexes comparably developed autoimmune 
hyperthyroidism characterized by TSHR stimulating autoantibodies, elevated T4 
values, hyperplastic thyroids and hearts. Autoimmune mice developed inflammatory 
eye symptoms and proptosis, although males earlier than females. Serial in vivo 
1H/19F-magnetic resonance imaging revealed elevated inflammatory infiltration, 
increased fat volume and glycosaminoglycan deposition in orbits of both sexes 
but most significantly in female mice. Histologically, infiltration of T-cells, 
extension of brown fat and overall collagen deposition were characteristics of 
GO in male mice. In contrast, female mice developed predominately macrophage 
infiltration in muscle and connective tissue, and muscle hypertrophy. Apart from 
sex-dependent variabilities in pathogenesis, disease classification revealed 
minor sex-differences in incidence and total outcome. In conclusion, sex does 
not predispose for autoimmune hyperthyroidism and associated GO.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this report is to describe the kinetic and kinematic 
analysis of walking gait following healed left proximal fifth metatarsal 
fractures.
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 62-year-old female presented at a chiropractic clinic with 
concerns that recent metatarsal fractures had not fully resolved and reported 
abnormal gait due to pain and several weeks use of a "walking boot." The 
patient's walking gait was evaluated with a force-sensor treadmill and an 
inertial measurement unit motion capture system. Recordings were made before, at 
midpoint, and post-chiropractic care (11 visits total). Data were analyzed for 
spatio-temporal gait parameters, vertical ground reaction forces, and ranges of 
motion of the hip, knee, and ankle.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Pre-care, the patient's self-rated disability in 
walking was 50 out of 80 on a Lower Extremity Functional Scale, which improved 
to 80 out of 80, post-care. Her self-selected preferred walking speed increased, 
as did step length, cadence, and single support time. Increased symmetry was 
seen in timing of peak ground reaction forces, stance phase percentages of 
loading and pre-swing, and ranges of motion for hip and knee flexion and 
extension.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient recovered completely, and the post-injury kinematic and 
kinetic data allowed for quantification of gait patterns and changes in the 
clinical environment.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term (3 year) efficacy and safety of secukinumab 
in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the extension phase of the 
FUTURE 1 study (NCT01892436).
METHODS: Following the 2-year core trial, eligible patients receiving 
subcutaneous secukinumab 150 or 75 mg entered a 3-year extension phase. Results 
are presented for key efficacy and safety endpoints at week 156.
RESULTS: In total, 460 patients entered the extension study; 308 patients 
originally randomised to secukinumab were assessed for efficacy. Sustained 
improvements in all efficacy endpoints were achieved with secukinumab through 
week 156. Overall, 76.8%/54.9% (secukinumab 150 mg) and 65.2%/39.0% (secukinumab 
75 mg) of patients achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50 
response (multiple imputation data); ACR20 responses were sustained irrespective 
of previous anti-tumour necrosis factor exposure. Improvements in quality of 
life and physical function were also sustained through week 156. Radiographic 
results (observed data; van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS)) showed 
that 78.1% (secukinumab 150 mg) and 74.8% (secukinumab 75 mg) of patients had no 
radiographic progression (≤0.5 increase in mTSS) through week 156. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for selected adverse events per 100 
patient-years (secukinumab 150/75 mg) were serious infections (1.7/1.6), Candida 
infections (1.4/0.7), Crohn's disease (0/0.3), ulcerative colitis (0/0.3) and 
major adverse cardiac events (0.3/0.8).
CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous secukinumab provided sustained improvements in the 
signs and symptoms, quality of life and physical function of patients with 
active PsA with low rate of radiographic disease progression through 3 years. 
Secukinumab was well tolerated with no new safety signals.

INTRODUCTION: Simultaneous avulsion fractures of the insertion of both cruciate 
ligaments of the knee are extremely uncommon lesions and their treatment remains 
difficult. The purpose of this paper is to show an arthroscopic repair technique 
of simultaneous tibial avulsion fracture of both cruciate ligaments of the knee 
such by using an adjustable length suspension device.
CASE REPORT: A 25-year-oldmale patient was treated by arthroscopic reduction and 
fixation of both bony avulsion of cruciate ligaments of the knee with a sliding 
and adjustable length suspension device (ZipTight, Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA). 
There were no post-operative complications appeared. At 18-month follow-up, the 
patient was conducting normal life, free of symptoms. At clinical examination, 
Lachman, anterior drawer, pivot shift, posterior drawer, and reverse pivot shift 
tests were negative. Range of motion was 130° flexion, presenting a slight 5° of 
extension deficit. The International Knee Documentation Committee score was 
83.80 points. Lysholm scale was 85 points.
CONCLUSION: The described repair technique is able to provide stable fixation of 
bone fragments in the face of early fracture consolidation, as well as 
minimizing potential complications and surgical time.

Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a dreadful disease around the world, causing 
irreversible sequelae that shorten life expectancy and reduce quality of life 
despite current treatment. Here, the authors engineered a cell-enriched 
myocardial graft, composed of a decellularized myocardial matrix refilled with 
adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells (EMG-ATDPC). Once applied over the 
infarcted area in the swine MI model, the EMG-ATDPC improved cardiac function, 
reduced infarct size, attenuated fibrosis progression, and promoted 
neovascularization of the ischemic myocardium. The beneficial effects exerted by 
the EMG-ATDPC and the absence of identified adverse side effects should 
facilitate its clinical translation as a novel MI therapy in humans.

IMPORTANCE: Breast cancer surgery, the most common cancer operation performed in 
nursing home residents, is viewed as a low-risk surgical intervention. However, 
outcomes in patients with high functional dependence and limited life expectancy 
are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the overall survival and functional status changes after 
breast cancer surgery in female nursing home residents stratified by surgery 
type.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used Medicare claims from 2003 to 
2013 to identify 5969 US nursing home residents who underwent inpatient breast 
cancer surgery. Using the Minimum Data Set Activities of Daily Living (MDS-ADL) 
summary score, this study examined preoperative and postoperative function and 
identified patient characteristics associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality 
and 1-year functional decline after surgery. Cox proportional hazards regression 
was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality. 
Fine-Gray competing risks regression was used to estimate unadjusted and 
adjusted subhazard ratios (sHRs) of functional decline. Statistical analysis was 
performed from January 2016 to January 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional status and death.
RESULTS: From 2003 to 2013, a total of 5969 female nursing home residents (mean 
[SD] age, 82 [7] years; 4960 [83.1%] white) underwent breast cancer surgery: 666 
(11.2%) underwent lumpectomy, 1642 (27.5%) underwent mastectomy, and 3661 
(61.3%) underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection 
(ALND). The 30-day mortality rates were 8% after lumpectomy, 4% after 
mastectomy, and 2% after ALND. The 1-year mortality rates were 41% after 
lumpectomy, 30% after mastectomy, and 29% after ALND. Among 1-year survivors, 
the functional decline rate was 56% to 60%. The mean MDS-ADL score increased 
(signifying greater dependency) by 3 points for lumpectomy, 4 points for 
mastectomy, and 5 points for ALND. In multivariate analysis, poor baseline 
MDS-ADL score (range, 20-28) was associated with a higher 1-year mortality risk 
(lumpectomy: HR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.23-3.00], P = .004; mastectomy: HR, 1.80 [95% 
CI, 1.35-2.39], P < .001; and ALND: HR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.46-2.15], P < .001). 
After multivariate adjustment, preoperative decline in MDS-ADL score 
(lumpectomy: sHR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.25-2.03], P < .001; mastectomy: sHR, 1.79; 
[95% CI, 1.52-2.09], P < .001; and ALND: sHR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.56-1.91], 
P < .001) and cognitive impairment (lumpectomy: sHR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.03-1.56], 
P = .02; mastectomy: sHR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45], P = .002; and ALND: sHR, 
1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.24], P = .003) were significantly associated with 1-year 
functional decline across all breast cancer surgery groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For female nursing home residents who underwent 
breast cancer surgery, 30-day mortality and survival as well as 1-year mortality 
and functional decline were high. The 1-year survivors had significant 
functional decline. This study's findings suggest that this information should 
be incorporated into collaborative surgical decision-making processes.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy of less than 1 year is usually a contraindication 
for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The aim was to 
identify patients at risk of death during the first year after implantation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were derived from a prospective Israeli ICD Registry. 
Two groups of patients were compared, those who died and those who were alive 1 
year after ICD implantation. Factors associated with 1-year mortality were 
identified on a derivation cohort. A risk score was established and validated. A 
total of 2617 patients have completed 1 year of follow-up after ICD or cardiac 
resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation. Age greater than 
75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.6 to 4.4), 
atrial fibrillation (AF; HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.17), chronic lung disease 
(HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.76), anemia (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.93) and 
chronic renal failure (CRF; HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.74 to 6.6) were independent risk 
factors for 1-year mortality. We propose a simple AAACC ("triple A double C") 
score for prediction of 1-year mortality after ICD implantation: Age greater 
than 75 years (3 points(pts)), anemia (2 pts), AF (1 pt), CRF (3 pts) and 
chronic lung disease (1 pt). Mortality risk increased with rising number of 
points (from 1% with 0 pts to 12.5% with >4 pts). The risk score was evaluated 
with receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve of the 
validation curve is 0.71 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.76).
CONCLUSIONS: Age greater than 75, AF, chronic lung disease, anemia, and CRF were 
independent risk factors for 1-year mortality. AAACC risk score identifies 
patients at high risk of death during 1 year after ICD implantation.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability and 
death in young adults worldwide. It results in around 1 million hospital 
admissions annually in the European Union (EU), causes a majority of the 50,000 
deaths from road traffic accidents and leaves a further ≈10,000 people severely 
disabled.
OBJECTIVE: The Eurotherm3235 Trial was a pragmatic trial examining the 
effectiveness of hypothermia (32-35 °C) to reduce raised intracranial pressure 
(ICP) following severe TBI and reduce morbidity and mortality 6 months after 
TBI.
DESIGN: An international, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Specialist neurological critical care units.
PARTICIPANTS: We included adult participants following TBI. Eligible patients 
had ICP monitoring in place with an ICP of > 20 mmHg despite first-line 
treatments. Participants were randomised to receive standard care with the 
addition of hypothermia (32-35 °C) or standard care alone. Online randomisation 
and the use of an electronic case report form (CRF) ensured concealment of 
random treatment allocation. It was not possible to blind local investigators to 
allocation as it was obvious which participants were receiving hypothermia. We
