OBJECTIVE: Cancer is a major cause of death in China. As alcohol drinking, a 
risk factor of cancer, is common in China, we aimed to estimate the 
alcohol-attributable cancer deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) 
across all provinces in China.
METHODS: We estimated the proportion of cancer deaths and YPLL attributable to 
alcohol consumption at the province level. Population attributable fraction 
(PAF) was calculated based on: 1) prevalence of alcohol consumption, obtained 
from the China National Nutrition and Health Survey 2002; 2) dose-response 
relative risks (RRs) of alcohol consumption and site-specific cancer, extracted 
from published meta-analyses; 3) cancer mortality data, originated from the 
National Program of Cancer Registry 2013.
RESULTS: We estimated that 98,306 cancer deaths were attributable to alcohol 
consumption and accounted for 4.56 % of the total cancer deaths in China in 
2013. Of these deaths, a total of 919,741.57 person-years premature loss of life 
was caused. Both overall PAF and average YPLL per 100,000 individuals were much 
higher in men than that in women (7.01 % vs. 0.33 % and 130.55 vs. 4.45, 
respectively). At the province level, overall PAF ranged from 2.14 % (95 % CI: 
1.40 %-2.87 %) in Shanghai to 6.56 % (95 % CI: 4.06 %-9.05 %) in Anhui and the 
average YPLL per 100,000 individuals ranged from 10.97 in Tibet to 106.52 in 
Shandong.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer burden attributable to alcohol consumption varied across 
provinces in China. Province-level approaches are warranted to decrease alcohol 
consumption and reduce the alcohol-related cancer burden.

PURPOSE: Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of two intracranial 
electroencephalography (iEEG) interventions: 1) stereoelectroencephalography 
(SEEG) and 2) placement of subdural grid electrodes (SDGs) both followed by 
resective surgery in patients with drug-resistant, partial-onset epilepsy, 
compared with medical management (MM) in Hungary from payer's perspective.
METHODS: The incremental health gains and costs of iEEG interventions have been 
determined with a combination of a decision tree and prevalence Markov process 
model over a 30-year time horizon in a cost-utility analysis (CUA). To address 
the effect of parameter uncertainty on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER), deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Our results showed that both SEEG and SDG interventions represent a 
more expensive but more effective strategy than MM representing the current 
standard of care. The total discounted cost of SEEG and SDG were € 32,760 and € 
25,028 representing € 18,108 and € 10,375 additional cost compared with MM, 
respectively. However, they provide an additional 3.931 (in SEEG group) and 
3.444 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; in SDG group), correspondingly. Thus, 
the ICER of SEEG is € 4607 per QALY gain, while the ICER for SDG is € 3013 per 
QALY gain, compared with MM. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of € 41,058 per 
QALY in Hungary, both subtypes of iEEG interventions are cost-effective and 
provide good value for money.
SIGNIFICANCE: Because of the high cost of implanting electrodes and monitoring, 
the invasive EEG for patients with refractory epilepsy is currently not 
available in the Hungarian national healthcare system. Our study demonstrated 
that these procedures in Hungary are cost-effective compared with the MM. As a 
result, the introduction of iEEG interventions to the reimbursement list of the 
National Health Insurance Fund Administration was initiated.

Electron donor cytochrome b5 is required for hyphal tip accumulation of

fumigatus.

The electron donor cytochrome b5 (CybE/Cyb5) fuels the activity of the 
ergosterol biosynthesis-related P450 enzymes/P450s by providing electrons to 
P450s to promote ergosterol biosynthesis. Previous studies reported that lack of 
Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) CybE reduces the proportion of ergosterol 
in total sterols and induces severe growth defects. However, the molecular 
characteristics of CybE and the underlying mechanism for CybE maintaining A. 
fumigatus growth remain poorly understood. Here, we found that CybE locates at 
the endoplasmic reticulum by its C-terminus with two transmembrane regions. 
Therefore, lack of the C-terminus of CybE is able to phenocopy a cybE deletion. 
Notably, cybE deletion reduced the accumulation of the sterol-rich plasma 
membrane domains (SRDs, the assembly platform of polarity factors/cell end 
markers and growth machinery) in hyphal tips and decreased membrane fluidity, 
which correspond to tardiness of hyphal extension and hypersensitivity to low 
temperature in cybE deletion mutant. Additionally, overexpressing another 
electron donor-heme-independent P450 reductase (CPR) significantly rescued 
growth defects and recovered SRD accumulation in deletion of cybE almost to the 
wild-type level, suggesting CybE maintaining the growth and deposition of SRDs 
in hyphal tips attributes to its nature as an electron donor. Protein pull-down 
assays revealed that CybE probably participates in metabolism and transfer of 
lipids, construction of cytoskeleton and mitochondria-associated energy 
metabolism to maintain the SRD accumulation in hyphal tips, membrane fluidity 
and hyphal extension. Findings in this study give a hint that inhibition of CybE 
may be an effective strategy for resisting the infection of the human pathogen 
A. fumigatus Importance Investigating the knowledge of the growth regulation in 
the human opportunistic pathogen A. fumigatus is conducive to design new 
antifungal approach. The electron donor cytochrome b5 (CybE) plays a crucial 
role in maintaining the normal growth of A. fumigatus, however, the potential 
mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we characterized the molecular features of 
CybE and found the C-terminus with two transmembrane domains are required for 
its ER localization and functions. In addition, we demonstrated that CprA, an 
electron donor-heme-independent P450 reductase, provides a reciprocal function 
for the missing cytochrome b5 protein-CybE in A. fumigatus CybE maintains the 
normal growth probably via supporting two crucial physiological processes, the 
SRD accumulation in hyphal tips and membrane fluidity. Therefore, our finding 
reveals the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of CybE on A. fumigatus 
growth and indicates that inhibition of CybE might be an effective approach for 
alleviating A. fumigatus infection.

Rare diseases comprise a diverse group of conditions, most of which involve 
genetic causes. We describe the variable spectrum of findings and clinical 
impacts of exome sequencing (ES) in a cohort of 500 patients with rare diseases. 
In total, 164 primary findings were reported in 158 patients, representing an 
overall diagnostic yield of 31.6%. Most of the findings (61.6%) corresponded to 
autosomal dominant conditions, followed by autosomal recessive (25.6%) and 
X-linked (12.8%) conditions. These patients harbored 195 variants, among which 
43.6% are novel in the literature. The rate of molecular diagnosis was 
considerably higher for prenatal samples (67%; 4/6), younger children (44%; 
24/55), consanguinity (50%; 3/6), gastrointestinal/liver disease (44%; 16/36) 
and syndromic/malformative conditions (41%; 72/175). For 15.6% of the cohort 
patients, we observed a direct potential for the redirection of care with 
targeted therapy, tumor screening, medication adjustment and monitoring for 
disease-specific complications. Secondary findings were reported in 37 patients 
(7.4%). Based on cost-effectiveness studies in the literature, we speculate that 
the reports of secondary findings may influence an increase of 123.2 years in 
the life expectancy for our cohort, or 0.246 years/cohort patient. ES is a 
powerful method to identify the molecular bases of monogenic disorders and 
redirect clinical care.

With increased life expectancy, age-associated cognitive decline becomes a 
growing concern, even in the absence of recognizable neurodegenerative disease. 
The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated during aging and contributes 
to age-related brain phenotypes. We demonstrate that treatment with the 
drug-like small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB reverses ISR activation in the 
brain, as indicated by decreased levels of activating transcription factor 4 
(ATF4) and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2. 
Furthermore, ISRIB treatment reverses spatial memory deficits and ameliorates 
working memory in old mice. At the cellular level in the hippocampus, ISR 
inhibition (i) rescues intrinsic neuronal electrophysiological properties, (ii) 
restores spine density and (iii) reduces immune profiles, specifically 
interferon and T cell-mediated responses. Thus, pharmacological interference 
with the ISR emerges as a promising intervention strategy for combating 
age-related cognitive decline in otherwise healthy individuals.

Cost-effectiveness of Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Men With a History of 
Falls.

Worcester.

IMPORTANCE: Falls and osteoporosis share the potential clinical end point of 
fractures among older patients. To date, few fall prevention guidelines 
incorporate screening for osteoporosis to reduce fall-related fractures.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis using 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) followed by osteoporosis treatment in 
older men with a history of falls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a Markov model 
was developed to simulate the incidence of major osteoporotic fractures in a 
hypothetical cohort of community-dwelling men aged 65 years who had fallen at 
least once in the past year. Data sources included literature published from 
January 1, 1946, to July 31, 2020. The model adopted a societal perspective, a 
lifetime horizon, a 1-year cycle length, and a discount rate of 3% per year for 
both health benefits and costs. The analysis was designed and conducted from 
October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Screening with DXA followed by treatment for men diagnosed with 
osteoporosis compared with usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Among the hypothetical cohort of men aged 65 years, the screening 
strategy had an ICER of $33 169/QALY gained and was preferred over usual care at 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY gained. The number needed to 
screen to prevent 1 hip fracture was 1876; to prevent 1 major osteoporotic 
fracture, 746. The screening strategy would become more effective and less 
costly than usual care for men 77 years and older. The ICER for the screening 
strategy did not substantially change across a wide range of assumptions tested 
in all other deterministic sensitivity analyses. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50 000/QALY gained, screening was cost-effective in 56.0% of 
simulations; at $100 000/QALY gained, 90.8% of simulations; and at $200 000/QALY 
gained, 99.6% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that for older men who have 
fallen at least once in the past year, screening with DXA followed by treatment 
for those diagnosed with osteoporosis is a cost-effective use of resources. Fall 
history could be a useful cue to trigger assessment for osteoporosis in men.

Albumin-binding fusion partners are frequently used as a means for the in vivo 
half-life extension of small therapeutic molecules that would normally be 
cleared very rapidly from circulation. However, in applications where small size 
is key, fusion to an additional molecule can be disadvantageous. Albumin-derived 
affinity proteins (ADAPTs) are a new type of scaffold proteins based on one of 
the albumin-binding domains of streptococcal protein G, with engineered binding 
specificities against numerous targets. Here, we engineered this scaffold 
further and showed that this domain, as small as 6 kDa, can harbor two distinct 
binding surfaces and utilize them to interact with two targets simultaneously. 
These novel ADAPTs were developed to possess affinity toward both serum albumin 
as well as another clinically relevant target, thus circumventing the need for 
an albumin-binding fusion partner. To accomplish this, we designed a phage 
display library and used it to successfully select for single-domain bispecific 
binders toward a panel of targets: TNFα, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), renin, angiogenin, myeloid-derived growth factor 
(MYDGF), and insulin. Apart from successfully identifying bispecific binders for 
all targets, we also demonstrated the formation of the ternary complex 
consisting of the ADAPT together with albumin and each of the five targets, 
TNFα, PSA, angiogenin, MYDGF, and insulin. This simultaneous binding of albumin 
and other targets presents an opportunity to combine the advantages of small 
molecules with those of larger ones allowing for lower cost of goods and 
noninvasive administration routes while still maintaining a sufficient in vivo 
half-life.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to rank capabilities and suggest a 
relevant set of capabilities for the Swedish context to inform the development 
of capability-adjusted life years (CALYs). CALYs is a quality of life measure 
for policy making based on the capability approach by Amartya Sen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Swedish governmental review proposed the following 10 
relevant capabilities: time, financial situation, mental/physical health, 
political resources, knowledge, living environment, occupation, social 
relations, security, and housing. Researchers in health-related disciplines from 
5 universities ranked these capabilities from 1 to 10 (most to least important) 
in a web-based cross-sectional survey; 115 of 171 responses were eligible.
RESULTS: Health, social relations, and financial situation were deemed most 
important. Stratification by gender, research field, and age group revealed few 
differences. We found that it was possible to rank capabilities and that health, 
social relations, and financial situation were ranked highest by a 
non-representative sample of researchers and doctoral students from 
health-related disciplines at five Swedish universities.
CONCLUSIONS: The revealed ranking is dependent on the metric and must be further 
explored. The findings support continued development of CALYs for monitoring and 
evaluating outcomes in public health and social-welfare interventions.

The national health promotion program, Health Japan 21 (second term), began in 
2013. This program has set 5 basic goals: to extend healthy life expectancy and 
reduce health disparity, to prevent noncommunicable disease, to improve function 
for social life, to establish a social environment for health, and to improve 
lifestyle. To achieve these goals, Health Japan 21 (second term) set 53 targets 
for the period between 2013 and 2022. At the interim evaluation in 2018, only 21 
of the 53 targets were judged likely to be achieved by 2022. In addition, 18 
targets were judged as unchanged, and 1 target was judged to be deteriorating. 
Thus, to achieve the goals of Health Japan 21 (second term), further efforts to 
strengthen health promotion programs across Japan are needed.

The Life Science Symposium held by the Nutrition Research Committee of the 
International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Japan in 2018, "Fusion of Nutrition 
and Exercise Sciences Leading to Extension of Healthy Life Expectancy," covered 
current topics in the science of nutrition and exercise to address extending 
healthy life expectancy. Presentation topics included (1) lifestyle and gut 
microbiota; (2) how to use lipids in sports nutrition; (3) the effect and 
molecular mechanism of improvement of arteriosclerosis by exercise and 
nutrition; (4) physical activity and nutrition that support brain function; (5) 
skeletal muscles and food ingredients that support healthy longevity; (6) 
measures against sarcopenia by exercise and nutrient intake; (7) physical 
activity/exercise for disease prevention; (8) nutritional epidemiology research 
for the Japanese population; (9) new developments in health science in viewed 
from nutrition and intestinal flora; (10) why do Asians develop nonobese 
metabolic disease?; and (11) social implementation of the health promotion 
program by ILSI Japan. The speakers emphasized the promotion of research on 
exercise and nutrition interactions and encouraged social implementation of the 
research results in public and private sectors.

The application of science to human nutrition over the centuries has served 
societies well. One example is the identification of key nutrients to overcome 
nutritional deficiencies, which has enhanced life expectancy. Enhanced life 
expectancy, however, is associated with an increased prevalence of chronic 
disorders related to food and nutrition. Findings of studies indicating that 
individual responses to nutrients differ substantially between individuals make 
it necessary to re-examine the relationship between nutrition and human health. 
The emergence of new genomic-based technologies illustrates the complexity and 
scale of the interactions between nutrition and genetic factors. Epigenetic 
modifications resulting from interactions of the genetic profile, aging, and 
lifestyle can influence the time course of chronic disorders and contribute to 
human variability in response to nutritional interventions. Developing a better 
understanding of human variability as it applies to human nutrition will involve 
embracing the approaches and principles of complex science.

Why has Japan become the longest-lived country in the world? The longevity is 
often attributed to Japan's economic growth, but Japan experienced an extended 
life expectancy prior to achieving such economic growth. During and after the 
Second World War when the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the 
Allied Powers was occupying Japan, the welfare administration system was 
drastically reformed, resulting in dramatic improvements in the hygiene status, 
which led to an increase in the average life expectancy in Japan. Here, this 
background is reviewed, along with an explanation of how Japan has become the 
world's longest-lived country.

ESGE recommends considering the following indications for enteral tube 
insertion: (i) clinical conditions that make oral intake impossible 
(neurological conditions, obstructive causes); (ii) acute and/or chronic 
diseases that result in a catabolic state where oral intake becomes 
insufficient; and (iii) chronic small-bowel obstruction requiring a 
decompression gastrostomy.Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE 
recommends the use of temporary feeding tubes placed through a natural orifice 
(either nostril) in patients expected to require enteral nutrition (EN) for less 
than 4 weeks. If it is anticipated that EN will be required for more than 4 
weeks, percutaneous access should be considered, depending on the clinical 
setting.Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE recommends the gastric 
route as the primary option in patients in need of EN support. Only in patients 
with altered/unfavorable gastric anatomy (e. g. after previous surgery), 
impaired gastric emptying, intolerance to gastric feeding, or with a high risk 
of aspiration, should the jejunal route be chosen.Strong recommendation, 
moderate quality evidence.ESGE suggests that recent gastrointestinal (GI) 
bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease with risk of rebleeding should be 
considered to be a relative contraindication to percutaneous enteral access 
procedures, as should hemodynamic or respiratory instability.Weak 
recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE suggests that the presence of ascites 
and ventriculoperitoneal shunts should be considered to be additional risk 
factors for infection and, therefore, further preventive precautions must be 
taken in these cases.Weak recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE recommends 
that percutaneous tube placement (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG], 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension [PEG-J], or direct 
percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy [D-PEJ]) should be considered to be a 
procedure with high hemorrhagic risk, and that in order to reduce this risk, 
specific guidelines for antiplatelet or anticoagulant use should be followed 
strictly.Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE recommends refraining 
from PEG placement in patients with advanced dementia.Strong recommendation, low 
quality evidence.ESGE recommends refraining from PEG placement in patients with 
a life expectancy shorter than 30 days.Strong recommendation, low quality 
evidence*.

Distal radius fractures are the most common type of upper limb fractures in 
adults. Non-union after distal radius fracture is rare, serious and 
unpredictable. The aim of our paper is to analyse the clinical and radiological 
outcomes of bone grafting and Sauvé-Kapandji Procedures for the treatment of 
aseptic distal radius non-union. We enrolled 13 patients with distal radius 
aseptic non-union. The following parameters were evaluated: The surgical time, 
elbow, forearm and wrist range of motion, the subjective quality of life and the 
wrist function measured by Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
(QuickDASH), Pain Visual Analogic Score (VAS) and the complication rate. Bone 
union was measured using the radiographic union score as described by 
Radiographic Union Score (RUS). The evaluation endpoint was set at 24 months 
after surgery. All patients achieved fracture union. Grip strength improved by 
12.4 kg. There was also improvement in wrist flexion, in wrist extension, and 
forearm pronosupination. These ranges of motion and grip strength improvements 
were statistically significant. Only 6 patients returned to full activity. This 
surgical technique represents a reliable alternative for treatment of distal 
radius aseptic non-unions. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term 
clinical results of this surgical procedure.

BACKGROUND: Hearing aids (HA) is the primary medical intervention aimed to 
reduce hearing handicap. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of HA for 
older adults who were volunteered to be screened for hearing loss in a 
community-based mobile hearing clinic (MHC).
METHODS: Participants with (1) at least moderate hearing loss (≥40 dB HL) in at 
least one ear, (2) no prior usage of HA, (3) no ear related medical 
complications, and (4) had a Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥ 18 were 
eligible for this study. Using a delayed-start study design, participants were 
randomized into the immediate-start (Fitted) group where HA was fitted 
immediately or the delayed-start (Not Fitted) group where HA fitting was delayed 
for three months. Cost utility analysis was used to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of being fitted with HA combined with short-term, aural 
rehabilitation with the routine care group who were not fitted with HA. 
Incremental cost effectiveness ration (ICER) was computed. Health Utility Index 
(HUI-3) was used to measure utility gain, a component required to derive the 
quality adjusted life years (QALY). Total costs included direct healthcare 
costs, direct non-healthcare costs and indirect costs (productivity loss of 
participant and caregiver). Demographic data was collected during the index 
visit to MHC. Cost and utility data were collected three months after index 
visit and projected to five years.
RESULTS: There were 264 participants in the Fitted group and 163 participants in 
the Not Fitted group. No between-group differences in age, gender, ethnicity, 
housing type and degree of hearing loss were observed at baseline. At 3 months, 
HA fitting led to a mean utility increase of 0.12 and an ICER gain of 
S$42,790/QALY (95% CI: S$32, 793/QALY to S$62,221/QALY). At five years, the ICER 
was estimated to be at S$11,964/QALY (95% CI: S$8996/QALY to S$17,080/QALY) 
assuming 70% of the participants continued using the HA. As fewer individuals 
continued using their fitted HA, the ICER increased.
CONCLUSIONS: HA fitting can be cost-effective and could improve the quality of 
life of hearing-impaired older individuals within a brief period of device 
fitting. Long term cost-effectiveness of HA fitting is dependent on its 
continued usage.

OBJECTIVES: In France, 9-valent HPV vaccination is recommended routinely for 
11-14-years-old girls and as catch-up for 15-19-years-old girls. Recently, 
recommendation for gender-neutral vaccination (GNV) has been approved. The 
objectives of the study were to assess the public health impact and 
cost-effectiveness of a 9-valent GNV compared with girls-only vaccination 
program (GOV).
METHODS: A published HPV disease transmission dynamic model accounting for herd 
protection effects with a 100-year time horizon was adapted and calibrated to 
French data. Epidemiological and economic outcomes included disease cases 
averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were measured in 2018 Euros (€). A coverage rate 
of 26.2% among girls and boys was assumed for the GNV program based on the 
current female coverage rate in France. The base case included genital warts, 
cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers. Scenario analyses included all 
HPV-related diseases and considered higher vaccination coverage rate (60%). 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses on key inputs were performed.
RESULTS: Over 100 years, GNV resulted in an additional reduction of 9,519 and 
3,037 cervical cancer cases and deaths; 6,901 and 1,166 additional anal cancer 
cases and deaths; and a reduction of additional 1,284,077 genital warts compared 
with current GOV and an ICER of 24,763€/QALY. When including all HPV-related 
diseases, the ICER was 15,184€/QALY. At a higher coverage rate (60%), GNV would 
prevent 17,430 and 4,334 additional anogenital cancer cases and deaths and over 
two million genital warts compared with GOV with an ICER of 40,401€/QALY. 
Results were sensitive to a higher discount rate (6% versus 4%) and a shorter 
duration of protection (20 years versus lifetime).
CONCLUSIONS: In France, GNV has a significant impact in terms of public health 
benefits and may be considered cost-effective compared with GOV at low and high 
coverage rates.

The prevalence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in the elderly is expected 
to increase by nearly a third in the next decade. Its management in older 
patients is potentially more challenging due to their pre-existing medical 
comorbidities, frailty, reduced life expectancy, and social issues. The aim of 
this retrospective review was to report on treatment given to patients aged 75 
years and over, case mix, and survival. All patients aged 75 years and over who 
were diagnosed with OSCC in Merseyside between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 
2016, and treated with either curative or palliative intent, were included. 
Their hospital notes were reviewed. Fisher's exact test and Kaplan-Meier 
analysis were used for data analysis. There were 236 patients (median (IQR) age 
81 (78-86) years); 67% were treated curatively and 33% palliatively. Factors 
associated with palliation included older age, advanced tumour stage, cognitive 
impairment, and residence in a nursing or residential home. Of the 165 patients 
who were offered curative treatment, six (4%) declined due to personal or family 
reasons. Overall survival for palliative patients was 12% at one year and 7% at 
two years, whereas for patients treated curatively it was 74% at one year, 56% 
at two years, and 34% at five years. Patients over 85 years of age were less 
likely to have composite free flaps and postoperative radiotherapy. 
Perioperative mortality was 2.6%. Improvements in surgical techniques and 
perioperative management have enabled clinicians to offer treatment with 
curative intent to older frail patients, and with careful case selection 
outcomes can be very good.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive disease that 
imparts a substantial socioeconomic burden to society and healthcare systems. 
The prevalence of knee OA has dramatically risen in recent decades due to 
consistent increases in life expectancy and obesity worldwide. Patient 
education, physical exercise, and weight loss (for overweight or obese 
individuals) constitute the first-line knee OA treatment approach. However, less 
than 40% of patients with knee OA receive this kind of intervention. There is an 
unmet need for healthcare professionals treating individuals with knee OA to 
understand the current recommended treatment strategies to provide effective 
rehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: To guide physical therapists in their clinical decision making by 
summarizing the safest and most efficacious treatment options currently 
available, and by delineating the most traditional outcome measures used in 
clinical research for knee OA.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for healthcare providers to abandon low-quality and 
ineffective treatments and educate themselves and their patients about the 
current best evidence-based practices for knee OA.
