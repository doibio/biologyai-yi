BACKGROUND: The impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) extension/complexity on 
outcomes and on the comparative benefits/risks of zotarolimus-eluting stent 
(ZES) versus bare-metal stents (BMS) remains unclear in patients at high risk of 
bleeding or thrombosis or at low restenosis risk.
METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of the ZEUS trial. The impact of 
coronary anatomic complexity measured by the SYNTAX score on the differences in 
outcomes following ZES and BMS was assessed at 1 year.
RESULTS: The mean SYNTAX score was 16.3 ± 13.1 with a median of 12 (IQR: 7 to 
22). We stratified patients according to SYNTAX tertiles (0-8: n = 563; >8-19 
n = 532; >19: n = 511), and observed that the higher the score, the 
correspondingly higher was the rate of the primary endpoint of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) and other ischemic events, but not bleeding after 
adjustment. The superior efficacy of ZES versus BMS for MACE was consistent 
across SYNTAX tertiles (tertile 1: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44-1.13; tertile 2: HR 
0.71, 95% CI 0.46-1.09; tertile 3: HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61-1.10) without 
significant heterogeneity (p for trend = 0.55). This between-groups difference 
mainly reflected a reduction in MI and TVR without effect on mortality. There 
was no significant interaction between the SYNTAX score and allocated stent type 
with respect to ischemic and bleeding endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: The SYNTAX score was predictor of major adverse cardiovascular 
events but not bleeding and ZES provided superior efficacy and safety than BMS 
across the whole spectrum of CAD complexity. SYNTAX score may be routinely used 
for the assessment of the ischemic risk (but not bleeding) after PCI and should 
not guide the decision-making for DES versus BMS in patients undergoing PCI.

BACKGROUND: There is a considerable global burden of invasive group B 
streptococcal (GBS) disease. Vaccines are being developed for use in pregnant 
women to offer protection to neonates.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of maternal 
immunisation against neonatal and maternal invasive GBS disease in the UK.
METHODS: We developed a decision-tree model encompassing GBS-related events in 
infants and mothers, following a birth cohort with a time horizon equivalent to 
average life expectancy (81 years). We parameterised the model using 
contemporary data from disease surveillance and outcomes in GBS survivors. Costs 
were taken from NHS sources and research studies. Maternal immunisation in 
combination with risk-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) was 
compared to the current standard practice of risk-based IAP alone from an NHS 
and Personal Social Services (health-provider) perspective. We estimated the 
cases averted and cost per QALY gained through vaccination. One-way sensitivity 
analysis, scenario analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: An effective maternal immunisation programme could substantially reduce 
the burden of GBS disease. The deterministic analysis estimated the threshold 
cost-effective price for a GBS vaccine to be £54 per dose at £20,000/QALY (£71 
per dose at £30,000/QALY). Results were most sensitive to assumptions on disease 
incidence, sequelae rate and vaccine efficacy. Probabilistic analysis showed 
90.66% of iterations fell under the £30,000 threshold at a vaccine price of £55. 
Inclusion of modest prevention of stillbirths and/or, preterm births, carer 
health impacts, maternal GBS deaths and 1.5% discounting improved 
cost-effectiveness compared to the base case. Lowering vaccine strain coverage 
made the vaccine less cost-effective. A key limitation is that the properties of 
the final GBS vaccine are unknown.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal GBS immunisation is expected to be cost-effective, even at 
a relatively high vaccine price.

Medical and Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan.

CONTEXT: Due to increased life expectancy worldwide, women are expected to spend 
a significant portion of their lives in menopause. Proven prevention strategies 
against serious risks and tested effective treatments for common symptoms may 
remain unutilized in our population if these women are not asked about these 
symptoms.
AIM: This study aims to assess the prevalence of different menopausal symptoms 
and their severity according to menopause rating scale (MRS) in women.
SETTING AND DESIGN: The present study was a cross-sectional survey, conducted in 
the outpatient department of gynecology and obstetrics.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After written and informed consent, 121 women having their 
last menstrual period at least 1 year ago were included. The menopausal symptoms 
were assessed using the MRS. The primary outcome measure in this study was the 
prevalence of menopausal symptoms in these women according to MRS and the 
severity of these symptoms.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using the SPSS software program, 
version 15.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).
RESULTS: The most common symptom was mental and physical exhaustion which was 
reported by 88 (72%) women, followed by joint and muscular discomfort which was 
reported by 83 (68.59%). Hot flushes were reported by 54 (44.62%) respondents. 
Majority of women reported mild-to-moderate symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of menopausal symptoms is high, and a health policy 
needs to be generated for the region.

The improving life expectancy for CF is known to be one of the biggest success 
stories in medicine. Life expectancy has increased from 6 months during the 
early 20th century to 42.7 years from in 2012-2016. As the life expectancy of CF 
patients has increased, it is important to consider other co-morbidities that 
these patients may encounter, and the impact this may have on their morbidity 
and mortality. We present a case of a 33-year-old male admitted to the hospital 
for a CF exacerbation who had an acute neurological decompensation due to an 
infarction of his right occipital and posterior temporal lobe.

OBJECTIVE: This article presents alternative parental health spillover 
quantification methods in the context of a randomised controlled trial comparing 
family therapy with treatment as usual as an intervention for self-harming 
adolescents, and discusses the practical limitations of those methods.
METHODS: The trial followed a sample of 754 participants aged 11-17 years. 
Health utilities are measured using answers to the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 3 Levels 
(EQ-5D-3L) for the adolescent and the Health Utility Index (HUI2) for one parent 
at baseline, 6 and 12 months. We use regression analyses to evaluate the 
association between the parent's and adolescent's health utilities as part of an 
explanatory regression model including health-related and demographic 
characteristics of both the adolescent and the parent. We then measure 
cost-effectiveness over a 12-month period as mean incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios using various spillover quantification methods. We propose an original 
quantification based on the use of a household welfare function along with an 
equivalence scale to generate a health gain within the family to be added to the 
adolescent's quality-adjusted life-year gain.
RESULTS: We find that the parent's health utility increased over the duration of 
the trial and is significantly and positively associated with adolescent's 
health utility at 6 and 12 months but not at baseline. When considering the 
adolescent's health gain only, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 
£40,453 per quality-adjusted life-year. When including the health spillover to 
one parent, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates range from 
£27,167 per quality-adjusted life-year to £40,838 per quality-adjusted life-year 
and can be a dominated option depending on the quantification method used.
CONCLUSION: According to the health spillover quantification method considered, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios vary from within the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold 
range to not being cost-effective.

The human lifespan in the developed countries significantly increased, from 
about 40 years to 80 years, in the last hundred years. This change is due to 
multiple factors, however, the development of medicine and pharmacological 
research as well as social well-being and social care are primarily important. 
For aging, the attrition of the parts of the whole organism are responsible, 
which is caused by endogenous oxidation processes (free radicals), which can 
destroy any cells in the organism. The injury of the defense or regulatory organ 
systems (immune system, neuroendocrine system) influences the whole organism, 
causing its decline (aging), later complete loss of abilities (death). The 
organism has built-in mechanisms for defence (e.g., antioxidant enzymes), 
however, their functions are not enough in our modern, chemically seriously 
contaminated age and further support is needed. This support is represented by 
antioxidants, as vitamins A, C, and E, resveratrol, and pharmaceuticals as 
rapamycine and rapalogs, selegiline, metformin etc., which have important roles 
in the increase of lifespan and health span. The early start of treatments and 
the use of pharmaceutical combinations seem to be important. The paper 
introduces our today's' lifespan prolongers and discusses their effects as well 
as points to the ways of future development. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(41):

Publisher: Absztrakt: Az emberi élettartam a gazdaságilag fejlett országokban az 
utolsó száz évben jelentősen megnőtt, mintegy 40 évről 80 évre emelkedett. Ebben 
sok tényező játszott szerepet, de különösen az orvostudomány és a 
gyógyszerkutatás fejlődése, melyeket messzemenően kiegészített a szociális jólét 
és a szociális gondozás elterjedése. Az öregedésért elsősorban az egész 
szervezet alkotóinak kopása felelős, melyet endogén oxidációs folyamatok (szabad 
gyökök) váltanak ki, ezek ugyanis kárt tesznek a szervezet bármely sejtjében. A 
szervezet védekező- és irányítórendszereiben (immunrendszer, neuroendokrin 
rendszer) történő károsodás az egész szervezetre kihat, és annak leépülését 
(öregedés) és funkcióképtelenségét (halál) okozza. A szervezetnek vannak 
beépített védekezőmechanizmusai (például antioxidáns enzimek), de ezek működése 
kémiailag mesterségesen szennyezett korunkban nem elégséges, így külső 
támogatásra szorulunk. Ezt a támogatást biztosítják az antioxidánsok (mint A-, 
C-, E-vitaminok, rezveratrol) és a gyógyszerek (mint rapamicin, rapalógok, 
szelegilin, metformin stb.), melyek fontos szerepet játszanak az élettartam és 
az egészséges élettartam (jólléttartam) növelésében. Fontosnak látszik a 
kezelések korai megkezdése és a kombinációk alkalmazása. A cikk bemutatja a

The treatment of metastatic prostate cancer can be divided into two 
pathophysiological phases: hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant phases. 
Huggins' observation in the year 1941, which was awarded with the Nobel Prize in 
1966, has a key role in treatment during the hormone-sensitive phase, stating 
that if the testicles are removed, the size of the prostate cancer decreases. 
Inducing androgen deprivation, i.e., testosterone depletion is the basic 
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer that patients have to receive life-long. 
In the past eight years, five new agents have been approved besides docetaxel in 
the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: sipuleucel-T, 
cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, and radium-223. With the sequential 
application of these agents, significant improvement can be achieved in 
survival. Besides the latest developments, the hormone-sensitive phase has 
become the focus of attention, especially in the treatment of patients with de 
novo metastases and poor prognosis. Many studies have proven the outstanding 
efficacy of adding early docetaxel and abiraterone to androgen deprivation 
therapy. The authors give a detailed overview of clinical studies leading to a 
paradigm change in treatment during the hormone-sensitive phase, and call 
attention to the difficulties encountered in Hungarian practice. Orv Hetil.

Publisher: Absztrakt: A metasztatikus prosztatadaganat kezelése kórélettanilag 
két stádiumra osztható: hormonérzékeny és kasztrációrezisztens fázis. A 
hormonérzékeny szakasz kezelésében a mai napig Huggins 1966-ban Nobel-díjjal 
jutalmazott 1941. évi megfigyelésének van kulcsszerepe, miszerint a herék 
eltávolítása esetén a prosztatadaganat mérete csökken. Az androgéndeprivatio, 
azaz a tesztoszteronhiány előidézése jelenleg a metasztatikus prosztatacarcinoma 
bázisterápiája, a betegeknek életük végéig ebben a kezelésben kell részesülniük. 
Az elmúlt nyolc évben a docetaxel mellett további öt új hatóanyag került 
törzskönyvezésre metasztatikus kasztrációrezisztens prosztatadaganat kezelésére: 
sipuleucel-T, kabazitaxel, abirateron, enzalutamid, rádium-223. Ezen szerek 
szekvenciális alkalmazásával jelentős túlélésjavulást lehet elérni. Az új 
fejlesztések mellett fókuszba került a hormonérzékeny szakasz is, kiemelten a 
kedvezőtlenebb prognózisú, de novo áttétes betegek kezelése. Több vizsgálat 
igazolta az androgéndeprivatio mellett alkalmazott korai docetaxel, illetve 
abirateron kiváló hatékonyságát. A szerzők részletesen ismertetik a 
hormonérzékeny szakaszban paradigmaváltáshoz vezető klinikai vizsgálatok

OBJECTIVES: Balneotherapy with mud application (mud therapy) is a common 
hydrothermal intervention for the treatment and rehabilitation of elderly 
patients with osteoarthritis, leading to anti-inflammatory effects. The main 
purpose of this investigation was to study a role for regulatory T cells in 
these anti-inflammatory effects. The second objective was to assess whether the 
neutrophil-mediated innate response is affected by these anti-inflammatory 
effects.
METHODS: Thirty-six elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis underwent a 10-day 
cycle of balneotherapy at a spa center. They received daily sessions of 
whole-body mud therapy at 40-42 °C, using mineral-medicinal water and mud. IL-8 
and TGF-β serum concentrations, percentage of circulating CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ and 
CD8+ CD28- regulatory T cells, and neutrophil phagocytic capacity were evaluated 
at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Clinical assessments included 
knee flexion and extension angle, pain, stiffness, physical function and 
health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: All clinical outcomes significantly improved. Circulating 
concentrations of IL-8 and TGF-β decreased, which correlated with decreased pain 
and improved knee flexion, respectively. Percentage of CD4+ regulatory T cells 
decreased, whereas CD8+ regulatory T cells increased. Neutrophil functional 
capacity increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Balneotherapy with mud application was effective in the management 
of osteoarthritis symptoms. The anti-inflammatory effect mediated by cytokines 
contributed to the improvement in pain and joint function; and changes in the 
circulating percentage of regulatory T cells seem to be involved in the 
anti-inflammatory effects. Improvement in neutrophil function after mud therapy 
reflects an optimal bioregulatory effect on the inflammatory and innate 
responses.

In-situ 2D bacterial crystal growth as a function of protein concentration: An 
atomic force microscopy study.

The interplay between protein concentration and (observation) time has been 
investigated for the adsorption and crystal growth of the bacterial SbpA 
proteins on hydrophobic fluoride-functionalized SiO2 surfaces. For this purpose, 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been performed in real-time for monitoring 
protein crystal growth at different protein concentrations. Results reveal that 
(1) crystal formation occurs at concentrations above 0.08 µM and (2) the 
compliance of the formed crystal decreases by increasing protein concentration. 
All the crystal domains observed presented similar lattice parameters (being the 
mean value for the unit cell: a = 14.8 ± 0.5 nm, b = 14.7 ± 0.5 nm, 
γ = 90 ° ± 2). Protein film formation is shown to take place from initial 
nucleation points which originate a gradual and fast extension of the 
crystalline domains. The Avrami equation describes well the experimental 
results. Overall, the results suggest that protein-substrate interactions 
prevail over protein-protein interactions. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: AFM enables to 
monitor protein crystallization in real-time. AFM high-resolution determines 
lattice parameters and viscoelastic properties. S-layer crystal growth rate 
increases with protein concentration. Avrami equation models protein crystal 
growth.

AIMS: The routine use of dual-mobility (DM) acetabular components in total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) may not be cost-effective, but an increasing number of 
patients undergoing THA have a coexisting spinal disorder, which increases the 
risk of postoperative instability, and these patients may benefit from DM 
articulations. This study seeks to examine the cost-effectiveness of DM 
components as an alternative to standard articulations in these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A decision analysis model was used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of using DM components in patients who would be at high risk 
for dislocation within one year of THA. Direct and indirect costs of 
dislocation, incremental costs of using DM components, quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) values, and the probabilities of dislocation were derived from 
published data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was established 
with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis was 
used to examine the impact of variation.
RESULTS: In the base case, patients with a spinal deformity were modelled to 
have an 8% probability of dislocation following primary THA based on published 
clinical ranges. Sensitivity analysis revealed that, at its current average 
price ($1000), DM is cost-effective if it reduces the probability of dislocation 
to 0.9%. The threshold cost at which DM ceased being cost-effective was $1180, 
while the ICER associated with a DM THA was $71 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that under specific clinical and economic 
thresholds, DM components are a cost-effective form of treatment for patients 
with spinal deformity who are at high risk of dislocation after THA. Cite this

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant 
multi-organ vascular disorder associated with bleeding and a reduced life 
expectancy. We present a 91-year-old woman with complications of previously 
undiagnosed HHT. This case demonstrates three potential complications: pulmonary 
arteriovenous malformation (AVM) resulting in a right to left shunt, cerebral 
infarctions and pericardial effusion. Despite these potentially life-threatening 
complications and the reduced life-expectancy associated with HHT the patient 
has survived to an advanced age. Due to the patient's late diagnosis and 
frailty, the treatment options of AVM embolization and pericardiocentesis were 
deemed inappropriate. The patient was treated with tranexamic acid to reduce 
bleeding severity and discharged home with a care package and home oxygen.

This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial that verified the 
resistance training efficacy on neuromuscular parameters, with muscle quality as 
primary outcome. Forty-four elderly with diabetes type 2 (69.7 ± 6.9 years; 26 
men) were randomly allocated to a 12-weeks resistance training group (RTG, 3 
times a week), or an active control group with stretching classes (CG, once a 
week). Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 
12 weeks, as follow: quadriceps muscle thickness and rectus femoris muscle 
quality, maximal knee extension strength, rapid strength, functional 
performance, visceral adipose tissue, glycemic control, lipid profile and 
quality of life. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyses based on 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches, which showed the same results. 
Among all outcomes measured there were improvements in the knee extension 
strength (P < 0.001) and quadriceps muscle thickness (P < 0.001) for RTG. The 
muscle quality did not improve for both groups (P = 0.98). For the secondary 
outcomes there were no improvements for functional performance, rapid strength, 
glycemic control, quality of life, visceral adipose tissue and lipid profile in 
both groups, with exception of triglyceride level reduction for RTG 
(P = 0.04).The resistance training program is an efficacious strategy for 
improve the neuromuscular health in elderly with T2DM, considering increases in 
lower limb strength and muscle mass, but the same was not found for muscle 
quality, rapid strength, functional performance and quality of life. 
Furthermore, the training program did not induce significant reduction in 
glycated hemoglobin values of patients who already had suitable glycemic 
control.

Three dimensional electron microscopy is becoming a very data-intensive field in 
which vast amounts of experimental images are acquired at high speed. To manage 
such large-scale projects, we had previously developed a modular workflow system 
called Scipion (de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016). We present here a major 
extension of Scipion that allows processing of EM images while the data is being 
acquired. This approach helps to detect problems at early stages, saves 
computing time and provides users with a detailed evaluation of the data quality 
before the acquisition is finished. At present, Scipion has been deployed and is 
in production mode in seven Cryo-EM facilities throughout the world.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine (DTG + ABC/3TC) compared with 
raltegravir + abacavir/lamivudine (RAL + ABC/3TC) and ritonavir-boosted 
darunavir + abacavir/lamivudine (DRV/r + ABC/3TC) in HIV-1-infected 
treatment-naive patients in Russia.
METHODS: A dynamic Markov model was developed with five response states and six 
CD4+-based health states. Efficacy estimated as probability of viral suppression 
(HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) at 48 weeks was obtained from a published network 
meta-analysis. Baseline cohort characteristics and health state utilities were 
informed using DTG phase 3 clinical trials. Health care resource use was 
obtained from literature and costed using published unit costs. Costs (presented 
in Russian rubles) included antiretroviral drug costs; HIV management costs such 
as routine care; costs of treating cardiovascular conditions, opportunistic 
infections, and drug-related adverse effects; and mortality costs. A patient 
lifetime analysis was conducted using the societal perspective. Outcomes were 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, incremental cost per QALY 
ratio, and incremental cost per responder.
RESULTS: The viral suppression rate among patients receiving DTG + ABC/3TC was 
71.7% compared with 65.2% for RAL + ABC/3TC and 59.6% for DRV/r + ABC/3TC. The 
mean duration of response per patient was 116.6 months for DTG + ABC/3TC, 108.6 
months for RAL + ABC/3TC, and 98.9 months for DRV/r + ABC/3TC. Total discounted 
costs for treatment over patient lifetime were RUB 2.89, 5.32, and 4.38 million 
for DTG + ABC/3TC, RAL + ABC/3TC, and DRV/r + ABC/3TC, respectively. Lifetime 
discounted QALYs were 12.73 for patients on DTG + ABC/3TC and 12.72 each for 
patients on RAL + ABC/3TC and DRV/r + ABC/3TC. DTG + ABC/3TC thus dominated the 
other two alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: With lower costs, higher response rates, and comparable QALYs, 
DTG + ABC/3TC can be considered as a cost-effective alternative.

There is no simple way to prescribe hemodialysis. Changes in the dialysis 
population, improvements in dialysis techniques, and different attitudes towards 
the initiation of dialysis have influenced treatment goals and, consequently, 
dialysis prescription. However, in clinical practice prescription of dialysis 
still often follows a "one size fits all" rule, and there is no agreed 
distinction between treatment goals for the younger, lower-risk population, and 
for older, high comorbidity patients. In the younger dialysis population, 
efficiency is our main goal, as assessed by the demonstrated close relationship 
between depuration (tested by kinetic adequacy) and survival. In the ageing 
dialysis population, tolerance is probably a better objective: "good dialysis" 
should allow the patient to attain a stable metabolic balance with minimal 
dialysis-related morbidity. We would like therefore to open the discussion on a 
personalized approach to dialysis prescription, focused on efficiency in younger 
patients and on tolerance in older ones, based on life expectancy, comorbidity, 
residual kidney function, and nutritional status, with particular attention 
placed on elderly, high-comorbidity populations, such as the ones presently 
treated in most European centers. Prescription of dialysis includes reaching 
decisions on the following elements: dialysis modality (hemodialysis (HD) or 
hemodiafiltration (HDF)); type of membrane (permeability, surface); and the 
frequency and duration of sessions. Blood and dialysate flow, anticoagulation, 
and reinfusion (in HDF) are also briefly discussed. The approach described in 
this concept paper was developed considering the following items: nutritional 
markers and integrated scores (albumin, pre-albumin, cholesterol; body size, 
Body Mass Index (BMI), Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), and Subjective 
Global Assessment (SGA)); life expectancy (age, comorbidity (Charlson Index), 
and dialysis vintage); kinetic goals (Kt/V, normalized protein catabolic rate 
(n-PCR), calcium phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), beta-2 microglobulin); 
technical aspects including vascular access (fistula versus catheter, degree of 
functionality); residual kidney function and weight gain; and dialysis tolerance 
(intradialytic hypotension, post-dialysis fatigue, and subjective evaluation of 
the effect of dialysis on quality of life). In the era of personalized medicine, 
we hope the approach described in this concept paper, which requires validation 
but has the merit of providing innovation, may be a first step towards raising 
attention on this issue and will be of help in guiding dialysis choices that 
exploit the extraordinary potential of the present dialysis "menu".

Recovery capital highlights person and environmental resources associated with 
overcoming significant life challenges. This paper utilizes social cognitive 
theory as a framework for understanding how recovery capital functions in trauma 
adaptation. This theory outlines the bidirectional, dynamic interactions among 
person (e.g., cognitive and affective), behavioral (e.g., problem focused 
coping), and environmental variables (i.e., triadic reciprocal determinism). The 
value of this approach to understanding human adaptation to trauma is that it 
targets the self-regulatory processes that unfold for trauma survivors as they 
attempt to put their lives back together. Self-regulation shift theory (SRST), 
as an extension to social cognitive theory, is offered to explain how 
self-regulation is involved in both positive and negative adjustment. The theory 
uses a dynamical systems approach and highlights the mechanisms related to 
non-linear shifts in both positive and negative trauma recovery. According to 
SRST, trauma recovery may not be linear with threshold shifts (i.e., 
bifurcations) from one organized state (broken self) to another (empowered 
self). Coping self-efficacy perceptions are a critical factor influencing these 
threshold shifts. This paper concludes with a brief review of study designs and 
analytic procedures that can facilitate the application of non-linear dynamic 
research in this area.

Erratum in
    Pharmacoeconomics. 2018 Nov 22;:

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company 
that manufactures ceritinib (Zykadia®, Novartis) to submit evidence on the 
clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug, as a first-line treatment for 
adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive (+) advanced 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as part of the Institute's single technology 
appraisal (STA) process. The CRD (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and CHE 
(Centre for Health Economics) Technology Assessment Group at the University of 
York was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper 
describes the Company's submission (CS), the ERG review and NICE's subsequent 
decisions. The evidence submitted in support of ceritinib, as the first-line 
treatment in ALK+ advanced NSCLC, was a phase III, international, multicentre, 
open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing ceritinib with 
pemetrexed/cisplatin plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy (chemotherapy [CT] 
group). The results indicated that ceritinib prolonged progression-free survival 
(PFS) compared with CT. The only comparator considered in the CS was crizotinib. 
The evidence selected in support of crizotinib was PROFILE 1014, an open-label 
RCT of crizotinib, compared with pemetrexed/cisplatin CT (without maintenance 
therapy), in previously untreated advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC. The design 
and population of PROFILE 1014 was similar to that of ASCEND-4, though there 
were some differences between the trials. The Company considered it not possible 
to perform an 'anchor-based' analysis of first-line ceritinib and crizotinib, 
and presented a Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) of ceritinib and 
crizotinib using only the ALK inhibitor arm of ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. The 
indirect comparison suggests that ceritinib may be more effective in prolonging 
PFS than crizotinib. The ERG agreed that an indirect comparison using only the 
ALK inhibitor arm of the trials was the only option available in the present 
assessment; however, a number of limitations and potential bias were identified 
in this analysis. The Company's model estimated that ceritinib was cost 
effective when compared with crizotinib. However, the ERG highlighted several 
concerns with the Company's analysis; the ERG's preferred base case estimated an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £69,255 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(no patient access scheme [PAS] included). The ERG considered the economic 
analysis to be sensitive to changes in assumption used, partly due to the due to 
the immaturity of the overall survival data from trials, which leads to 
uncertainty around the extrapolation used. The NICE Appraisal Committee 
concluded that ceritinib is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as 
an option for untreated ALK+ advanced NSCLC in adults, if the Company provides 
it with the discount agreed in the PAS.

A high-glucose diet (HGD) is associated with the development of metabolic 
diseases that decrease life expectancy, including obesity and type-2 diabetes 
(T2D); however, the mechanism through which a HGD does so is still unclear. 
Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, has been shown to promote both 
cell and organismal survival. The goal of this study was to determine whether 
exposure of Caenorhabditis elegans to a HGD affects autophagy and thus 
contributes to the observed lifespan reduction under a HGD. Unexpectedly, 
nematodes exposed to a HGD showed increased autophagic flux via an 
HLH-30/TFEB-dependent mechanism because animals with loss of HLH-30/TFEB, even 
those with high glucose exposure, had an extended lifespan, suggesting that 
HLH-30/TFEB might have detrimental effects on longevity through autophagy under 
this stress condition. Interestingly, pharmacological treatment with okadaic 
acid, an inhibitor of the PP2A and PP1 protein phosphatases, blocked HLH-30 
nuclear translocation, but not TAX-6/calcineurin suppression by RNAi, during 
glucose exposure. Together, our data support the suggested dual role of 
HLH-30/TFEB and autophagy, which, depending on the cellular context, may promote 
either organismal survival or death.

Reliable population estimates of life expectancy with dementia are required for 
shaping health-care policy. From the Dutch, population-based Rotterdam Study, 
10,348 persons were followed during 1990-2015 for dementia and death. We created 
multistate lifetables, and assessed the effect of postponing disease onset. 
During 120,673 person-years, 1,666 persons developed dementia, and 6,150 died. 
Overall life expectancy of women ranged from 18.0 years (95% confidence interval 
(CI): 17.8, 18.2) at age 65 to 2.3 years (95% CI: 2.2, 2.3) at age 95. Of total 
life expectancy at age 65, 5.7% (1.0 year (95% CI: 1.0, 1.1)) was lived with 
dementia, increasing with age to 42.1% (1.0 year, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.0) at age 95. 
For men, life expectancy ranged from 15.6 years (95% CI: 15.4, 15.9) at age 65 
to 1.8 years (95% CI: 1.7, 1.8) at age 95, of which 3.7% (95% CI: 0.6 year, 0.5, 
0.6) and 35.3% (95% CI: 0.6 year, 0.5, 0.7), respectively, was lived with 
dementia. Postponing dementia onset by 1-3 years resulted in 25%-57% reductions 
in years lived with dementia. Survival after diagnosis ranged from 6.7 years 
(95% CI: 5.3, 8.1) before age 70, to 2.6 years (95% CI: 2.3, 2.9) after age 90. 
The burden of dementia on individuals and society in terms of healthy life-years 
lost is large but could potentially be mitigated by preventive interventions at 
the population level.

been published on Project ECHO Palliative Care (Project ECHO PC) over the last 
18 months.
RECENT FINDINGS: Only two articles on Project ECHO PC have been published over 
the last 18 months: a descriptive study of experiences in seven health centers 
of the United States, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and India; and a quantitative 
and qualitative study of the impact of the teleECHO clinic on physicians and 
nurses in Northern Ireland, which reports a significant boost in knowledge 
acquisition and self-efficacy.
SUMMARY: Project ECHO is an innovative telemedicine strategy, which creates 
learning communities, which use a standardized methodology and benefits 
healthcare professionals, particularly primary care providers or practitioners 
based on remote or rural areas.Since 2011, Project ECHO PC has been implemented 
in 12 health centers in 4 different countries, with greater growth in 2017. It 
has facilitated a wider access to professional education, improvements in 
clinical practice and knowledge acquisition, the development of professional 
curricula and more confidence and self-efficacy among healthcare professionals. 
Project ECHO PC is engaged in several international initiatives to aid countries 
with different degrees of palliative care development.
