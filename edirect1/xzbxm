The accumulation of oxidative damage is strongly linked to age-dependent 
declines in cell function, but the contribution of oxidative damage to morbidity 
is still debated. Many organisms seem to tolerate oxidative damage, and the 
extension of health span and life span by augmenting antioxidant activity has 
been inconsistent. Here we use the Drosophila model system to investigate the 
relationship among oxidative stress, health span, and life span. The 
oxidation-dependent dissociation of the Calstabin protein from the ryanodine 
receptor has been shown to result in reduced muscle function in mammals. The 
S107 molecule is able to reestablish this binding resulting in improved muscle 
function. We find that S107 is able to restore motor function in aging 
Drosophila to young levels, and this effect of S107 is absent in calstabin 
(FK506-BP2) mutants. Interestingly, FK506-BP2 mutant flies have reduced 
sensitivity to the effects of age and oxidative stress on motor function between 
7 and 35 days of age. Muscle expression of FK506-BP2 in FK506-BP2 mutants 
completely restores the sensitivity of motor function to both age and oxidative 
stress, supporting the idea that the age-dependent decline in motor function in 
Drosophila requires FK506-BP2 function within the muscle. Although FK506-BP2 
mutant flies are found to have less sensitivity to oxidative stress, FK506-BP2 
mutants do not live longer than wild type. These results demonstrate that the 
deleterious effects of oxidation on motor function early in life are the result 
of a singular event that does not compromise survival.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In this pilot study, we assessed the safety and 
tolerability of combining sorafenib with 90Y radioembolization for the treatment 
of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).
METHODS: The study, conducted prospectively during 2009-2012, included eligible 
patients with unresectable hcc and a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Each 
patient received sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) for 6-8 weeks before 90Y 
treatment. Safety and tolerability were assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 40 patients enrolled, 29 completed treatment (combined therapy). 
In the initial cohort, the most common cause of hcc was hepatitis C (32.5%), and 
most patients were staged Child A (82.5%). The 29 patients who completed the 
study had similar baseline characteristics. Grades 1 and 2 toxicities accounted 
for 77.8% of all adverse events reported. The most common toxicities reported 
were fatigue (19.0%), alteration in liver function (7.9%), and diarrhea (6.3%). 
There were 12 grade 3 and 2 grade 4 toxicity events reported. One patient died 
of liver failure within 30 days after treatment. During the study, the sorafenib 
dose was reduced in 6 patients (20.7%), and sorafenib had to be interrupted in 4 
patients (13.8%) and discontinued in 4 patients (13.8%). The disease control 
rate was 72.4% per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 
and tumour necrosis was observed in 82.8% of patients. Overall survival in 
patients undergoing combined therapy was 12.4 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results demonstrate the safety and tolerability of 
combining 90Y radioembolization and sorafenib for advanced hcc. A larger 
prospective study is needed to determine the extent of the survival benefit.

With the increase in life expectancy, aging and age-related cognitive 
impairments are becoming one of the most important issues for human health. At 
the same time, it has been shown that epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as 
universally important factors in life expectancy. The Senescence Accelerated 
Mouse P8 (SAMP8) strain exhibits age-related deterioration evidenced in learning 
and memory abilities and is a useful model of neurodegenerative disease. In 
SAMP8, Environmental Enrichment (EE) increased DNA-methylation levels (5-mC) and 
reduced hydroxymethylation levels (5-hmC), as well as increased histone H3 and 
H4 acetylation levels. Likewise, we found changes in the hippocampal gene 
expression of some chromatin-modifying enzyme genes, such as Dnmt3b. Hdac1. 
Hdac2. Sirt2, and Sirt6. Subsequently, we assessed the effects of EE on 
neuroprotection-related transcription factors, such as the Nuclear regulatory 
factor 2 (Nrf2)-Antioxidant Response Element pathway and Nuclear Factor kappa 
Beta (NF-κB), which play critical roles in inflammation. We found that EE 
produces an increased expression of antioxidant genes, such as Hmox1. Aox1, and 
Cox2, and reduced the expression of inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and Cxcl10, 
all of this within the epigenetic context modified by EE. In conclusion, EE 
prevents epigenetic changes that promote or drive oxidative stress and 
inflammaging.

OBJECTIVE: To assess results of open repair (OR) of AAA in a single high volume 
center.
METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data of 450 patients who underwent 
elective OR of AAA at the Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of the 
Serbian Clinical Centre in the period between January 2013 and September 2014.
RESULTS: Postoperative death occurred in seven patients (1. 55%) during the 
first 30 postoperative days. The mortality was caused by: uncontrolled 
bleeding-1, acute myocardial infarction-1, ischemic colitis-2, MOFS-2, sepsis 
due to infection and dehiscence of laparotomy wound-1. Coronary artery disease 
(OR 3.89; CI 0.85-17.7; p = 0.0058), postoperative acute myocardial infarction 
(OR 29.9; CI 2.56-334.95; p = 0.0053), chronic renal failure (OR 7.5; CI 
1.35-8.5; p = 0.0073), colonic necrosis (OR 88.2; CI 4.77-1629.69; p = 0.0026), 
occlusion of the both hypogastric arteries and the inability to preserve at 
least one hypogastric artery (OR 17.4; CI 1.99-178.33; p = 0.0230), 
aortobifemoral reconstruction (OR 9.06; CI 1.76-46.49; p = 0.016), significant 
perioperative bleeding (>2 L) (OR 7.32; CI 1.31-10.79; p = 0.0001), hostile 
abdomen (OR 5.25; CI 1.3-21.1; p = 0.0055), inflammatory aneurysm (OR 13.99; CI 
2.88-65.09; p = 0.0002), supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (OR 18.7; CI 
3.8-90.6; p = 0.0003), prolonged aortic cross-clamping (>60 min) (OR 14.25; CI 
2.75-64.5; p = 0.0003), the intraoperative hypotension (OR 6.61; CI 0.71-61.07; 
p = 0.0545), the prolonged operation (>240 min) (OR 8.66; CI 0.91-81.56; 
p = 0.0585) and complete dehiscence of the laparotomy (OR 44.1; CI 3.39-572.78; 
p = 0.0396) increased the 30-day mortality in our study.
CONCLUSIONS: Early mortality after open repair of AAA in high volume center 
might be very low due to experienced multidisciplinary team. Centralized open 
aortic surgery might be solution for effective treatment of patients with 
unsuitable anatomy or for young patients with long life expectancy.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: All-oral regimens are associated with high cure rates in 
hepatitis C virus-genotype 1 (HCV-GT1) patients. Our aim was to assess the value 
of cure to the society for treating HCV infection.
METHODS: Markov model for HCV-GT1 projected long-term health outcomes, life 
years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The model compared 
second-generation triple (sofosbuvir+pegylated interferon+ribavirin [PR] and 
simeprevir+PR) and all-oral (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and 
ombitasvir+paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir±ribavirin) therapies with no 
treatment. Sustained virological response rates were based on Phase III RCTs. We 
assumed that 80% and 95% of HCV-GT1 patients were eligible for second-generation 
triple and all-oral regimens. Transition probabilities, utility and mortality 
were based on literature review. The value of cure was calculated by the 
difference in the savings from the economic gains associated with additional 
QALYs.
RESULTS: Model estimated 1.52 million treatment-naïve HCV-GT1 patients in the 
US. Treating all eligible HCV-GT1 patients with second-generation triple and 
all-oral therapies resulted in 3.2 million and 4.8 million additional QALYs 
gained compared to no treatment respectively. Using $50,000 as value of QALY, 
these regimens lead to savings of $185 billion and $299 billion; costs of these 
regimens were $109 billion and $128 billion. The value of cure with 
second-generation triple and all-oral regimens was $55 billion and $111 billion, 
when we conservatively assumed only drug costs. Cost savings were greater for 
HCV-GT1 patient cured with cirrhosis compared to patients without cirrhosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The recent evolution of regimens for HCV GT1 has increased efficacy 
and value of cure.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus 
acarbose as monotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) in China.
METHODS: The Cardiff Diabetes Model, an economic model designed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of comparator therapies in diabetes was used to simulate 
disease progression and estimate the long-term effect of treatments on patients. 
Systematic literature reviews, hospital surveys, meta-analysis and indirect 
treatment comparison were conducted to obtain model-required patient profiles, 
clinical data and costs. Health insurance costs (2015¥) were estimated over 40 
years from a healthcare payer perspective. Univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The model predicted that dapagliflozin had lower incidences of 
cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia and mortality events, was associated with a 
mean incremental benefit of 0.25 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and with a 
lower cost of ¥8,439 compared with acarbose. This resulted in a cost saving of 
¥33,786 per QALY gained with dapagliflozin. Sensitivity analyses determined that 
the results are robust.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin is dominant compared with acarbose as monotherapy for 
Chinese T2DM patients, with a little QALY gain and lower costs. Dapagliflozin 
offers a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative medication for 
treatment-naive patients in China, and may have a direct impact in reducing the 
disease burden of T2DM.

Replacing sitting by standing has been hypothesized to reduce the health risks 
of sitting, based on the assumption that muscles are passive during sitting and 
active during standing. Interventions have been more effective in overweight 
(OW) than in normal weight (NW) individuals, but subjects' muscle activities 
have not been quantified. This study compared quadriceps and hamstring muscle 
electromyographic (EMG) activity between 57 NW (body mass index (BMI) 22.5 ± 1.5 
kg/m2, female n = 36) and 27 OW (BMI 28.4 ± 2.9 kg/m2, female n = 8) subjects 
during non-fatiguing standing (15 s, EMGstanding) and sitting (30 min). EMG 
amplitude was normalized to EMG measured during maximal isometric knee extension 
and flexion (% EMGMVC), and sitting muscle inactivity and bursts were determined 
using 4 thresholds (60% or 90% EMGstanding and 1% or 2% EMGMVC). Comparisons 
were adjusted for sex, age, knee extension strength, and the individual 
threshold. Standing EMG amplitude was 36% higher in OW (1.9% ± 1.5% EMGMVC) than 
in NW (1.4% ± 1.4% EMGMVC, P < 0.05) subjects. During sitting, muscles were 
inactive 89.8% ± 12.7% of the measurement time with 12.7 ± 14.2 bursts/min 
across all thresholds. On average, 6% more activity was recorded in NW than in 
OW individuals for 3 of the 4 thresholds (P < 0.05 for 60% or 90% EMGstanding 
and 1% EMGMVC). In conclusion, the OW group had higher muscle activity amplitude 
during standing but more muscle inactivity during sitting for 3/4 of the 
thresholds tested. Interventions should test whether the observed heterogeneity 
in muscle activity affects the potential to gain cardiometabolic benefits from 
replacing sitting with standing.

BACKGROUND: In patients with coronary artery disease, treated with durable 
polymer-coated drug-eluting stents, the life-long presence of the polymer might 
delay arterial healing. Novel very thin strut biodegradable polymer stents, 
which leave only a bare metal stent after polymer resorption, might improve 
long-term outcome. We investigated in allcomers the safety and efficacy of three 
stents eluting either everolimus, sirolimus, or zotarolimus, often clinically 
used but never compared, of which the biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting 
stent was never before assessed in allcomers.
METHODS: The large-scale, investigator-initiated, multicentre, assessor and 
patient blinded, three-arm, randomised, BIO-RESORT non-inferiority trial was 
done at four clinical sites in the Netherlands. All-comer patients were aged 18 
years or older, capable of providing informed consent, and required a 
percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent implantation 
according to clinical guidelines or the operators' judgment. Exclusion criteria 
were: participation in another randomised drug or device study before reaching 
the primary endpoint of that study; planned surgery necessitating interruption 
of dual antiplatelet therapy within the first 6 months; known intolerance to 
components of the investigational product or medication required; uncertainty 
about the adherence to follow-up procedures or an assumed life expectancy of 
less than 1 year; or known pregnancy. Web-based computer-generated allocation 
sequences randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to treatment with very thin strut 
biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting or sirolimus-eluting stents (which 
differ substantially in type, amount, distribution, and resorption speed of 
their respective coating), or thin strut durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting 
stents. The primary endpoint was a composite of safety (cardiac death or target 
vessel-related myocardial infarction) and efficacy (target vessel 
revascularisation) at 12 months of follow up with a very thin strut 
biodegradable polymer of either everolimus-eluting or sirolimus-eluting stents, 
compared with durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting stents, analysed by intention 
to treat (non-inferiority margin 3·5%). This trial was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01674803.
FINDINGS: From Dec 21, 2012, to Aug 24, 2015, 3514 patients were enrolled and 
analysed, of whom 2449 (70%) had acute coronary syndromes, which included 1073 
(31%) ST-elevation myocardial infarctions. 12 month follow-up of 3490 (99%) 
patients (three lost to follow-up; 21 withdrawals) was available. The primary 
endpoint was met by 55 (5%) of 1172 patients assigned to everolimus-eluting 
stents, 55 (5%) of 1169 assigned to sirolimus-eluting stents and 63 (5%) of 1173 
assigned to zotarolimus-eluting stents. Non-inferiority of the 
everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents compared with 
zotarolimus-eluting stents was confirmed (both -0·7% absolute risk difference, 
95% CI -2·4 to 1·1; upper limit of one sided 95% CI 0·8%, 
pnon-inferiority<0·0001). Definite stent thrombosis (defined by the Academic 
Research Consortium) occurred in four (0·3%) of 1172 patients who were allocated 
to everolimus-eluting stents, four (0·3%) of 1169 patients who were allocated to 
sirolimus-eluting stents, and three (0·3%) of 1173 patients who were allocated 
to zotarolimus-eluting stents (log-rank p=0·70 for both comparisons with 
zotarolimus-eluting stents).
INTERPRETATION: At 12 month follow-up, both very thin strut drug-eluting stents 
with dissimilar biodegradable polymer coatings (eluting either everolimus or 
sirolimus) were non-inferior to the durable polymer stent (eluting zotarolimus) 
in treating allcomers with a high proportion of patients with acute coronary 
syndromes. The absence of a loss of 1 year safety and efficacy with the use of 
these two biodegradable polymer-coated stents is a prerequisite before assessing 
their potential longer-term benefits.

Septins are a protein family found in all eukaryotes (except higher plants) that 
have roles in membrane remodeling and formation of diffusion barriers and as a 
scaffold to recruit other proteins. In budding yeast, proper execution of 
cytokinesis and cell division requires the formation of a collar of 
circumferential filaments at the bud neck. These filaments are assembled from 
apolar septin hetero-octamers. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms 
that control the arrangement and dynamics of septin structures. In this study, 
we utilized both Förster resonance energy transfer and electron microscopy to 
analyze the biophysical properties of the septin-binding protein Bni5 and how 
its association with septin filaments affects their organization. We found that 
the interaction of Bni5 with the terminal subunit (Cdc11) at the junctions 
between adjacent hetero-octamers in paired filaments is highly cooperative. Both 
the C-terminal end of Bni5 and the C-terminal extension of Cdc11 make important 
contributions to their interaction. Moreover, this binding may stabilize the 
dimerization of Bni5, which, in turn, forms cross-filament braces that 
significantly narrow, and impose much more uniform spacing on, the gap between 
paired filaments.

Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV 
genome encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), small HDAg (HDAg-S), 
which is required for viral replication, and large HDAg (HDAg-L), which is 
essential for viral assembly. HDAg-L is identical to HDAg-S except that it bears 
a 19-amino acid extension at the C terminus. Both HDAgs contain a nuclear 
localization signal (NLS), but only HDAg-L contains a CRM1-independent nuclear 
export signal at its C terminus. The nuclear export activity of HDAg-L is 
important for HDV particle formation. However, the mechanisms of HDAg-L-mediated 
nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein are not clear. In this study, the host 
cellular RNA export complex TAP-Aly was found to form a complex with HDAg-L, but 
not with an export-defective HDAg-L mutant, in which Pro205 was replaced by Ala. 
HDAg-L was found to colocalize with TAP and Aly in the nucleus. The C-terminal 
domain of HDAg-L was shown to directly interact with the N terminus of TAP, 
whereas an HDAg-L mutant lacking the NLS failed to interact with full-length 
TAP. In addition, small hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of TAP or Aly 
reduced nuclear export of HDAg-L and assembly of HDV virions. Furthermore, a 
peptide, TAT-HDAg-L(198-210), containing the 10-amino acid TAT peptide and 
HDAg-L(198-210), inhibited the interaction between HDAg-L and TAP and blocked 
HDV virion assembly and secretion. These data demonstrate that formation and 
release of HDV particles are mediated by TAP and Aly.

BACKGROUND: Due to increased life expectancy, the number of elderly patients 
with gastric cancer is increasing. This study was designed to determine the role 
of preoperative frailty (PF) as a risk factor for postoperative complications 
and prognosis in the oldest elderly gastric cancer patients undergoing curative 
resection.
METHODS: A total of 165 patients older than 80 years who underwent radical 
gastrectomy for primary gastric cancer between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed. We 
collected data on the inflammation-nutritional status, morbidity, and survival 
of these patients. The relationship between postoperative complications and PF 
was analyzed by logistic regression, and a Cox proportional hazards model was 
performed to identify the prognostic factors.
RESULTS: A total of 54 (32.7%) patients were considered frail. PF was associated 
with an increased risk for postoperative complications [odds ratio (OR) 3.396; 
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.046-11.025; P = 0.042]. With a median follow-up 
of 37.0 (range 1.0-77.8) months, the 3 year overall survival (OS), 
recurrence-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates in the 
entire cohort were 46.1, 34.4, and 49.2%, respectively. A multivariate analysis 
of the inflammation-based prognostic factors showed that only PF was 
independently associated with OS (OR 1.613; 95% CI 1.052-2.473; P = 0.028), RFS 
(OR 1.859; 95% CI 1.279-2.703; P = 0.001), and CSS (OR 1.859; 95% CI 
1.279-2.703; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty based on an easily calculable preoperative measure is a 
useful marker to identify patients at increased risk for postoperative 
complications and is more predictive of survival than an inflammation-based 
prognostic score after gastrectomy. Thus, PF status should be included in the 
routine assessment of the oldest elderly patients with gastric cancer.

Aging poses an unique opportunity to study cancer biology and treatment in older 
adults. Breast cancer is often studied in young women; however, much 
investigation remains to be done on breast cancer in our expanding elderly 
population. Diagnostic and management strategies applicable to younger patients 
cannot be empirically used to manage older breast cancer patients. Lack of 
evidence-based data continues to be the major impediment toward delivery of 
personalized cancer care to elderly breast cancer patients. This article reviews 
the relevant literature on management of curable breast cancer in the elderly, 
the role of geriatric assessment, complex treatment decision making within the 
context of patient's expected life expectancy, comorbidities, physical function, 
socioeconomic status, barriers to health care delivery, goals of treatment, and 
therapy-related side effects. Continuing efforts for enrolling elderly breast 
cancer patients in contemporary clinical trials, and thus improving 
age-appropriate care, are emphasized.

Among the large placental mammals, ursids give birth to the most altricial 
neonates with the lowest neonatal:maternal body mass ratios. This is 
particularly exemplified by giant pandas. To examine whether there is 
compensation for the provision of developmentally important nutrients that other 
species groups may provide in utero, we examined changes in the lipids of 
colostrum and milk with time after birth in giant pandas. Lipids that are 
developmental signals or signal precursors, and those that are fundamental to 
nervous system construction, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
phosphatidylserines, appear early and then fall dramatically in concentration to 
a baseline at 20-30 days. The dynamics of lysophosphatidic acid and eicosanoids 
display similar patterns, but with progressive differences between mothers. 
Triglycerides occur at relatively low levels initially and increase in 
concentration until a plateau is reached at about 30 days. These patterns 
indicate an early provision of signalling lipids and their precursors, 
particularly lipids crucial to brain, retinal and central nervous system 
development, followed by a changeover to lipids for energy metabolism. Thus, in 
giant pandas, and possibly in all bears, lactation is adapted to provisioning a 
highly altricial neonate to a degree that suggests equivalence to an extension 
of gestation.

Saccular unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) have a prevalence of 3% in the 
adult population, and are being increasingly detected because of improved 
quality and higher frequency of cranial imaging. Large amounts of data, 
providing varying levels of evidence, have been published on aneurysm 
development, progression and rupture, but less information is available on the 
risks and efficacy of preventive treatment. When deciding how to best manage 
UIAs, clinicians must consider the age and life expectancy of the patient, the 
estimated risk of rupture, the risk of complications attributed to preventive 
treatment, and the level of anxiety caused by the awareness of having an 
aneurysm. This Review highlights the latest human data on the formation, 
progression and rupture of intracranial aneurysms, as well as risks associated 
with preventive treatment. Considering these we discuss the implication for 
clinical management. Furthermore, we highlight pivotal questions arising from 
current data on intracranial aneurysms and the implications the data have for 
future experimental or clinical research. We also discuss data on novel 
radiological surrogates for rupture for those aneurysms that do not require 
preventive occlusion. Finally, we provide guidance for clinicians who are 
confronted with patients with incidentally detected UIAs.

Criminal cases involving human immunodeficiency virus transmission or exposure 
require that courts correctly comprehend the rapidly evolving science of HIV 
transmission and the impact of an HIV diagnosis. This consensus statement, 
written by leading HIV clinicians and scientists, provides current scientific 
evidence to facilitate just outcomes in Australian criminal cases involving 
HIV.Main recommendations: Caution should be exercised when considering charges 
or prosecutions regarding HIV transmission or exposure because:Scientific 
evidence shows that the risk of HIV transmission during sex between partners of 
different HIV serostatus can be low, negligible or too low to quantify, even 
when the HIV-positive partner is not taking effective antiretroviral therapy, 
depending on the nature of the sexual act, the viral load of the partner with 
HIV, and whether a condom or pre-exposure prophylaxis is employed to reduce 
risk.The use of phylogenetic analysis in cases of suspected HIV transmission 
requires careful consideration of its limited probative value as evidence of 
causation of HIV infection, although such an approach may provide valuable 
information, particularly in relation to excluding HIV transmission between 
individuals.Most people recently infected with HIV are able to commence simple 
treatment providing them a normal and healthy life expectancy, largely 
comparable with their HIV-negative peers. Among people who have been diagnosed 
and are receiving treatment, HIV is rarely life threatening. People with HIV can 
conceive children with negligible risk to their partner and low risk to their 
child.Changes in management as result of the consensus statement: Given the 
limited risk of HIV transmission per sexual act and the limited long term harms 
experienced by most people recently diagnosed with HIV, appropriate care should 
be taken before HIV prosecutions are pursued. Careful attention should be paid 
to the best scientific evidence on HIV risk and harms, with consideration given 
to alternatives to prosecution, including public health management.

The impact of climate change on parasites and parasitic diseases is a growing 
concern and numerous empirical and mechanistic models have been developed to 
predict climate-driven spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of 
parasites and disease risk. Variation in parasite phenotype and life-history 
traits between isolates could undermine the application of such models at broad 
spatial scales. Seasonal variation in the transmission of the haematophagous 
gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus, one of the most pathogenic 
helminth species infecting sheep and goats worldwide, is primarily determined by 
the impact of environmental conditions on the free-living stages. To evaluate 
variability in the development success and mortality of the free-living stages 
of H. contortus and the impact of this variability on future climate impact 
modelling, three isolates of diverse origin were cultured at a range of 
temperatures between 15°C and 37°C to determine their development success 
compared with simulations using the GLOWORM-FL H. contortus model. No 
significant difference was observed in the developmental success of the three 
isolates of H. contortus tested, nor between isolates and model simulations. 
However, development success of all isolates at 37°C was lower than predicted by 
the model, suggesting the potential for overestimation of transmission risk at 
higher temperatures, such as those predicted under some scenarios of climate 
change. Recommendations are made for future climate impact modelling of 
gastrointestinal nematodes.

INTRODUCTION: Venous tumor thrombus of thyroid cancer that extend to the great 
vein is rare, and management criteria for venous thrombus have not been 
established yet. We report a surgical case of thyroid carcinoma with extensive 
tumor thrombus in the superior vena cava (SVC) and consider the appropriate 
treatment strategy for venous thrombus.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 75-year-old woman consulted our hospital because of 
thyroid carcinoma with an extensive tumor thrombus. Computed tomography (CT) 
revealed a solitary thyroid mass with extensive continuous tumor thrombus in the 
left internal jugular vein, innominate vein, and SVC. We planned complete tumor 
resection. During operation, the tumor thrombus in the SVC disappeared, 
suggesting that pulmonary embolism occurred. Therefore, she underwent total 
thyroidectomy with extensive phlebectomy (the innominate and internal jugular 
veins). Although she had some morbidities during her postoperative course, she 
was followed up for 6 months without progression of thyroid cancer.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Intravascular tumor extension of thyroid carcinoma is 
rare, but is a life-threatening complication. For patients with thyroid tumor 
with venous tumor thrombus, segmental resection and thrombectomy should be 
considered if radical operation is possible. Therefore, preoperative correct 
imaging evaluation and operative planning are necessary to perform safe and 
effective operations. We suggest a management criteria for patients with thyroid 
carcinoma with venous tumor thrombus.

Published reports indicate low retrieval rates for retrievable inferior vena 
cava (IVC) filters. We performed a historic-controlled study of a 5-year 
intervention (March 2007 to February 2012) to improve IVC filter retrieval rates 
at a university medical center serving a rural area. All adults with a 
retrievable filter placed were included, except those with a life expectancy <6 
months. The intervention included initial verbal counseling and printed 
educational materials, correspondence after discharge, and a hematology 
consultation. The control group included patients with retrievable filters 
placed in the 15 months preceding study initiation. In the control group, 116 
filters were placed and 27 (23%) were removed, compared to 378 filters placed 
and 169 (45%) removed during the intervention. Adjusting for patient 
characteristics, the odds ratio of retrieval during the intervention was 3.03 
(95% CI 1.85-4.27) compared to the control period. An intervention including 
patient education and hematology follow-up appeared to significantly improve IVC 
filter retrieval rates.

We report the discovery of the male of the rare caligiform copepod Kabataia 
ostorhynchi Kazachenko, Korotaeva & Kurochkin, 1972 on the gills of the 
type-host Oplegnathus woodwardi (Waite, 1900) captured in the Southern Ocean, 
off Australia. Light and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the unusual body 
plan of Kabataia Kazachenko, Korotaeva & Kurochkin, 1972, where only the first 
pedigerous somite is incorporated into the cephalothorax and the second and 
third pedigerous somites are fused to form a double-somite, visible both 
dorsally and ventrally. The adult female carries paired dorsal plates 
originating from the second pedigerous somite within this double-somite. In the 
male the second and third pedigerous somites are free and paired dorsal plates 
are present on the former. Kabataia exhibits sexual dimorphism in an unusually 
wide range of limbs. Most remarkable is the tubular extension from the exit pore 
of the maxillary gland at the base of the maxilla which reaches beyond the 
anterior margin of the mouth tube; this is present in the male only. Kabataia 
exhibits a functional articulation between the first and second pedigerous 
somites and thus lacks the diagnostic apomorphy of the family Trebiidae 
(incorporation of both first and second pedigerous somites into the 
cephalothorax). We propose to transfer Kabataia to the Pandaridae, since it 
shares the key synapomorphies of this family. Furthermore, we propose to 
transfer Innaprokofevnas Kazachenko, 2001 to the Dissonidae, which leaves 
Trebius Krøyer, 1838 as the only genus within the Trebiidae. The correct 
spelling of Philorthragoriscus Horst, 1897 is noted.

β-Thalassemia.

Origa R(1).

Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.

β-Thalassemia is caused by reduced (β+) or absent (β0) synthesis of the β-globin 
chains of hemoglobin. Three clinical and hematological conditions of increasing 
severity are recognized: the β-thalassemia carrier state, thalassemia 
intermedia, and thalassemia major, a severe transfusion-dependent anemia. The 
severity of disease expression is related mainly to the degree of α-globin chain 
excess, which precipitates in the red blood cell precursors, causing both 
mechanic and oxidative damage (ineffective erythropoiesis). Any mechanism that 
reduces the number of unbound α-globin chains in the red cells may ameliorate 
the detrimental effects of excess α-globin chains. Factors include the 
inheritance of mild/silent β-thalassemia mutations, the coinheritance of 
α-thalassemia alleles, and increased γ-globin chain production. The clinical 
severity of β-thalassemia syndromes is also influenced by genetic factors 
unlinked to globin genes as well as environmental conditions and management. 
Transfusions and oral iron chelation therapy have dramatically improved the 
quality of life for patients with thalassemia major. Previously a rapidly fatal 
disease in early childhood, β-thalassemia is now a chronic disease with a 
greater life expectancy. At present, the only definitive cure is bone marrow 
transplantation. Therapies undergoing investigation are modulators of 
erythropoiesis and stem cell gene therapy.Genet Med advance online publication

INTRODUCTION: During adrenal venous sampling (AVS) procedure, radiologists 
administer a contrast agent via the catheter to visualize the proper catheter 
position.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient with primary aldosteronism 
diagnostic-hypothesis was admitted for AVS. A venogram was performed to confirm 
the catheter's position with 2mL of Iopamidol 300 mg/mL. Samples were collected
