Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary liver cancer 
worldwide. Despite the severity of the disease and its impact on individuals, 
families, and communities, there remains an overall lack of awareness and 
interest in this disease. The information contained in the chapters of this book 
shows that this is indeed a significant public health and socioeconomic problem 
with varying levels of country-specific awareness. In Southeast Asia liver 
fluke, O. viverrini related CCA is endemic with the highest incidence worldwide 
in northeast Thailand, yet it is treatable and preventable. The chapters 
highlight significant advances in our knowledge of the biology and epidemiology 
of the O. viverrini species complex, intermediate hosts, systematics, population 
genetics, and the complexity of the three-host life cycle. A comprehensive 
conceptual framework has been developed to assist in understanding the 
complexity of molecular mechanisms of CCA carcinogenesis and cancer development 
which can result in improvement of targeted CCA therapy. There have been many 
advances in understanding the pathology of CCA in the biliary tract, including 
advances in prognosis and molecular pathogenesis. The development of different 
modalities and their advantages for diagnosis have increased diagnostic 
accuracy, providing reliable information allowing appropriate treatment and 
management programs to be selected for each patient. Particularly exciting is 
the recent development of a urine antigen assay which has revolutionized the 
diagnostic approach of opisthorchiasis due to its simplicity, the non-invasive 
nature of sample collection, and its ease of use in field settings. Significant 
in-roads and advances have been made in the surgical and systemic treatment of 
CCA patients. Additionally, a sophisticated data collection and analysis system, 
the Isan Cohort, has been developed and established for the treatment and 
control of CCA. Importantly, a greater understanding has been made of the 
social, community, religious, and anthropological issues initiating and 
sustaining the eating behavior of raw, partially cooked, and/or fermented fresh 
water fish. Specially designed education programs/curricula, based on currently 
available multidisciplinary hard data targeting school children, have been 
introduced since the inception of the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care 
Program (CASCAP) and the subsequent strategic Fluke Free Thailand Model. The 
education program is being expanded to other provinces in Thailand and in the 
near future to other Southeast Asian countries, initially to Lao PDR, where the 
Fluke Free Lao PDR program has already been implemented. Despite advances that 
have been made in many disciplines focused on O. viverrini related CCA, raising 
awareness of CCA at all levels, particularly across endemic regions, is still 
needed, as is raising the awareness of CCA globally. As parasites and parasite 
related diseases have no borders, it is critical that an effective common 
strategic plan is instigated and established between all countries where liver 
fluke, O. viverrini related CCA is a significant public health problem, thereby 
increasing the quality of life and life expectancy of millions of people who 
suffer from this insidious disease.

OBJECTIVES: Physical activity (PA) and telomeres both contribute to healthy 
aging and longevity. To investigate the optimal dosage of various PA for 
longevity and the role of telomere length in PA and mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 333,865 adults (mean age of 56 years) from 
the UK Biobank were analyzed.
METHODS: Walking, moderate PA (MPA), and vigorous PA (VPA) were self-reported 
via questionnaire, and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was measured. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to predict all-cause mortality risk. A 
flexible parametric Royston-Parmar survival model was used to estimate life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13.8 years, 19,789 deaths were recorded. 
Compared with the no-walking group, 90 to 720 minutes/week of walking was 
similarly associated with 27% to 31% of lower mortality and about 6 years of 
additional life expectancy. We observed nearly major benefits for mortality and 
life expectancy among those meeting the PA guidelines [151-300 minutes/wk for 
MPA: hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.75-0.85, 3.40-3.42 additional life years; 
76-150 minutes/wk for VPA: HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75-0.82, 2.61 years (2.33-2.89)] vs 
the no-PA group. Similar benefits were also observed at 76-150 and 
301-375 minutes/wk of MPA (18%-19% lower mortality, 3.20-3.42 gained years) or 
151-300 minutes/wk of VPA (20%-26% lower mortality, 2.41-2.61 gained years). The 
associations between MPA, VPA, and mortality risk were slightly mediated by LTL 
(≈1% mediation proportion, both P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggests a more flexible range of PA 
than the current PA guidelines, which could gain similar benefits and is easier 
to achieve: 90 to 720 minutes/wk of walking, 75 to 375 minutes/wk of MPA, and 75 
to 300 minutes/wk of VPA. Telomeres might be a potential mechanism by which PA 
promotes longevity.

Skin tears are acute wounds caused by mechanical forces resulting in the 
separation of the skin's outer layers. Skin tears are more likely to occur in 
vulnerable people such as older people and people with neurodegenerative 
conditions. Rising life expectancy means that the number of patients with skin 
tears is expected to increase. This article describes the characteristics of 
skin tears, details the risk factors for skin tears and explains the importance 
of using a holistic, evidence-based and person-centred approach to skin tear 
prevention, assessment and treatment. The article outlines the crucial role of 
nurses as part of the multidisciplinary team in the management of skin tears.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) continues 
to rise, resulting in a growing geriatric population. In Rwanda, a sub-Saharan 
LMIC, traumatic injuries are a common cause of mortality and morbidity. However, 
little is known about the frequency and type of traumatic injuries among 
geriatric populations in Rwanda.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the epidemiology and outcomes of trauma for geriatric 
patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) of the center Hospitalier 
Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda.
METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2019 to 
January 2020 at the ED of CHUK. Trauma patients aged 65 and above and alive at 
the time of evaluation were eligible for inclusion. Demographic characteristics 
were collected along with triage category, mechanism of injury, transfer status, 
transport method to CHUK, time spent at the ED, complications, and mortality 
predictors.
RESULTS: For the 100 patients enrolled, the most common injury mechanism was 
falls (63%), followed by road traffic accidents (28%). The majority of patients 
spent less than 48 h in the ED (63%). The mortality rate was 14%, with most 
deaths resulting from injury-related complications. Triage category, Kampala 
Trauma Score, and Glasgow Coma Scale were significant predictors of mortality, 
with p-values of 0.002, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of geriatric trauma found in this study can inform 
public health and clinical guidelines. Interventions targeting falls and road 
traffic accidents would target the most common geriatric trauma mechanisms, and 
clinical protocols that take into account predictors of mortality could improve 
outcomes and increase life expectancy for this population.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a fibroinflammatory syndrome leading to 
reduced quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Population-based 
estimates of the incidence, prevalence, and comorbidities of CP in China are 
scarce.
AIM: To characterize the incidence, prevalence, and comorbidities of CP in 
Sichuan Province, China, with population-based data.
METHODS: Data on CP from 2015 to 2021 were obtained from the Health Information 
Center of Sichuan Province. During the study period, a total of 38090 
individuals were diagnosed with CP in Sichuan Province. The yearly incidence 
rate and point prevalence rate (December 31, 2021) of CP were calculated. The 
prevalence of comorbid conditions in CP patients was estimated. The annual 
number of CP-related hospitalizations, hospital length of stay, and 
hospitalization costs for CP were evaluated. Yearly incidence rates were 
standardized for age by the direct method using the permanent population of 
Sichuan Province in the 2020 census as the standard population. An analysis of 
variance test for the linearity of scaled variables and the Cochran-Armitage 
trend test for categorical data were performed to investigate the yearly trends, 
and a two-sided test with P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The 38090 CP patients comprised 23280 males and 14810 females. The mean 
age of patients at CP diagnosis was 57.83 years, with male patients (55.87 
years) being younger than female patients (60.11 years) (P < 0.001). The mean 
incidence rate of CP during the study period was 6.81 per 100000 person-years, 
and the incidence of CP increased each year, from 4.03 per 100000 person-years 
in 2015 to 8.27 per 100000 person-years in 2021 (P < 0.001). The point 
prevalence rate of CP in 2021 was 45.52 per 100000 individuals for the total 
population, with rates of 55.04 per 100000 individuals for men and 35.78 per 
100000 individuals for women (P < 0.001). Individuals aged 65 years or older had 
the highest prevalence of CP (113.38 per 100000 individuals) (P < 0.001). 
Diabetes (26.32%) was the most common comorbidity in CP patients. The number of 
CP-related hospitalizations increased from 3739 in 2015 to 11009 in 2021. The 
total costs for CP-related hospitalizations for CP patients over the study 
period were 667.96 million yuan, with an average of 17538 yuan per patient.
CONCLUSION: The yearly incidence of CP is increasing, and the overall CP 
hospitalization cost has increased by 1.4 times during the last 7 years, 
indicating that CP remains a heavy health burden.

BACKGROUND: The Y chromosome has a specific region, namely the Azoospermia 
Factor (AZF) because azoospermia is typically reported in the microdeletion of 
the AZF region. This study aims to assess the characteristics of AZF 
microdeletion after screening a massive number of low sperm concentration men; 
and the Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) outcomes for 
retrieving sperm from azoospermic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective multiple-center study enrolled a total 
of 1121 men with azoospermia, cryptozoospermia, and severe oligozoospermia from 
December 2016 to June 2022. An extension analysis used a total of 17 STSs to 
detect the position-occurring microdeletion in the AZF region (AZFa, b, c, 
and/or d loci). Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) was 
performed to retrieve sperm in azoospermic men diagnosed AZFc microdeletion.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three men carried AZF microdeletion were detected 
in the 1121 participants (13.64%). The incidences of AZF microdeletion were 
confined to AZF a, c, and d regions, both individual and concurrence, with the 
most common in the AZFc region accounting for 49.67%; There was no significant 
difference in clinical and paraclinical characteristics between the deleted 
regions, except FSH level (highest in AZFa microdeletion, p = 0.043). The AZFc 
region was the most common type of AZF microdeletion (49.67%), including 
complete microdeletion (4 patients) and gr/gr partial microdeletion (39 
patients) with 50.00% and 63.63% in the success rate of mTESE, separately.
CONCLUSION: The absence of AZFa and/or AZFb regions often express the most 
severe phenotype - azoospermia and the increasing FSH level. The AZFc region 
played the most common microdeletion. Microdissection testicular sperm 
extraction (mTESE) was the possible therapy for sperm retrieval from the testis 
of azoospermia men having AZFc microdeletion.

BACKGROUND: Autistic individuals might undergo a magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) examination for clinical concerns or research. Increased sensory 
stimulation, lack of appropriate environmental adjustments, or lack of 
streamlined communication in the MRI suite may pose challenges to autistic 
patients and render MRI scans inaccessible. This study aimed at (i) exploring 
the MRI scan experiences of autistic adults in the United Kingdom; (ii) 
identifying barriers and enablers toward successful and safe MRI examinations; 
(iii) assessing autistic individuals' satisfaction with MRI service; and (iv) 
informing future recommendations for practice improvement.
METHODS: We distributed an online survey to the autistic community on social 
media, using snowball sampling. Inclusion criteria were: being older than 16, 
have an autism diagnosis or self-diagnosis, self-reported capacity to consent, 
and having had an MRI scan in the United Kingdom. We used descriptive statistics 
for demographics, inferential statistics for group comparisons/correlations, and 
content analysis for qualitative data.
RESULTS: We received 112 responses. A total of 29.6% of the respondents reported 
not being sent any information before the scan. Most participants (68%) 
confirmed that radiographers provided detailed information on the day of the 
examination, but only 17.1% reported that radiographers offered some reasonable 
environmental adjustments. Only 23.2% of them confirmed they disclosed their 
autistic identity when booking MRI scanning. We found that quality of 
communication, physical environment, patient emotions, staff training, and 
confounding societal factors impacted their MRI experiences. Autistic 
individuals rated their overall MRI experience as neutral and reported high 
levels of claustrophobia (44.8%).
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted a lack of effective communication and 
coordination of care, either between health care services or between patients 
and radiographers, and lack of reasonable adjustments as vital for more 
accessible and person-centered MRI scanning for autistic individuals. Enablers 
of successful scans included effective communication, adjusted MRI environment, 
scans tailored to individuals' needs/preferences, and well-trained staff.

Plain Language Summary: WHY IS THIS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE? Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) is an examination that shows human anatomy and may explain the 
causes of symptoms. Autistic people may need MRI scans for various reasons, such 
as low back pain, headaches, accidents, or epilepsy. They have known 
sensitivities to sound, light, smell, or touch and increased anxiety, so the 
narrow, loud, isolating, unfamiliar MRI environment may be overwhelming to them. 
If MRI scans are, for these reasons, inaccessible, many autistic people will 
have to live with long-standing conditions, pain, or other symptoms, or have 
delayed treatment, with impact on their quality of life, and life expectancy.
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY? We tried to understand how autistic people 
perceive MRI examinations, things that work, and the challenges they face. We 
also asked for their suggestions to improve practice and accessibility.
WHAT DID WE DO? We distributed an online questionnaire to autistic adults 
through social media. We analyzed the data using appropriate statistical and 
text analysis methods.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY? We received 112 responses. Autistic people 
rated their overall MRI experience as average. Nearly a third (29.6%) reported 
they were not sent any information before MRI, and only 17.1% reported that 
radiographers offered some reasonable environmental adjustments. Most 
participants (68%) reported that radiographers provided detailed information on 
the day of the scan. Only 23.2% of them disclosed their autistic identity when 
booking MRIs. We found that quality of communication, physical environment, 
patient emotions, staff training, stigma, and timely autism diagnosis impacted 
their MRI experiences.
WHAT DO THESE FINDINGS ADD TO WHAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN? Autistic people MRI scan 
experiences are at the heart of this project. Our project shows that MRI for 
common symptoms is often inaccessible by autistic people. We should improve the 
MRI environment, adjust communication format/content for them, and deliver 
person-centered care in MRI. Health care professionals should receive relevant 
training, to understand the challenges autistic people might face and better 
support them in MRI scanning.
WHAT ARE POTENTIAL WEAKNESSES IN THE STUDY? The pandemic has impacted 
participant recruitment; therefore, the results of this sample may not reflect 
the full impact on the wider autistic population or adequately represent the 
autistic community, due to small size and including only people who could 
consent.These results come from different centers, so there is a lot of 
variation in the use of MRI equipment.
HOW WILL THESE FINDINGS HELP AUTISTIC ADULTS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE? We outline 
the main challenges associated with MRI, so autistic adults and their 
families/carers understand more of what they could expect in future 
examinations; hopefully, researchers and scanner manufacturers will try to 
tackle these challenges to make MRI scans truly accessible for autistic 
people.We shared this knowledge with stakeholders to develop guidelines and 
started using it in training. We want to ensure that MRI is person-centered and 
more accessible for autistic patients.

BACKGROUND: Malignant tumors, mainly solid tumors, are a significant obstacle to 
the improvement of life expectancy at present. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule 
(EpCAM), a cancer stem cell biomarker, showed widespread expression in most 
normal epithelial cells and most cancers. Although the clinical significance of 
EpCAM in various malignant solid tumors has been studied extensively, the latent 
relationships between EpCAM and pathological and clinical characteristics in 
solid tumors and differences in the roles of EpCAM among tumors have not been 
clearly determined. The destination point of this study was to analyze the value 
of EpCAM in solid tumors in clinicopathological and prognostic dimension using a 
meta-analysis approach.

published up to March 7th, 2022, in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane 
library and PMC databases was performed. The relationships between EpCAM 
overexpression, clinicopathological characteristics, and survival outcomes were 
analyzed. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 
odds ratios (ORs) were estimated as indicators of the degree of correlation. 
This research was registered on PROSPERO (International prospective register of 
systematic reviews), ID: CRD42022315070.
RESULTS: In total, 57 articles and 14184 cases were included in this study. High 
EpCAM expression had a significant coherence with a poorer overall survival (OS) 
(HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08-1.58, P < 0.01) and a worse disease-free survival (DFS) 
(HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.28-1.95, P < 0.01), especially of gastrointestinal tumors' 
OS (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.15-1.95, P < 0.01), and DFS (HR: 1.84, 95% CI: 
1.52-2.33, P < 0.01). The DFS of head and neck tumors (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 
1.51-3.61, P < 0.01) was also associated with the overexpression of EpCAM. There 
were no positive relationships between the overexpression of EpCAM and sex (RR: 
1.03, 95% CI: 0.99-1.07, P = 0.141), T classification (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 
0.82-1.06, P = 0.293), lymph node metastasis (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.54-1.32, P = 
0.461), distant metastasis (RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.84-1.10, P = 0.606), vascular 
infiltration (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.85-1.29, P = 0.611), and TNM stage (RR: 0.93, 
95% CI: 0.83-1.04, P = 0.187). However, the overexpression of EpCAM exhibited a 
significant association with the histological grades (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 
0.80-0.97, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Based on pooled HRs, the positive expression of EpCAM was totally 
correlated to a worse OS and DFS in solid tumors. The expression of EpCAM was 
related to a worse OS in gastrointestinal tumors and a worse DFS in 
gastrointestinal tumors and head and neck tumors. Moreover, EpCAM expression was 
correlated with the histological grade. The results presented pointed out that 
EpCAM could serve as a prognostic biomarker for gastrointestinal and head and 
neck tumors.

Background: Recent international, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials 
(SPRINT-2; RESPOND-2) demonstrated that the triple combination of peginterferon 
(PEG), ribavirin (RBV) and boceprevir (BOC) was more efficacious than the 
standard dual therapy of PEG and RBV in treatment of patients chronically 
infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of triple therapy in both 
treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients in Hungary. Methods: A Markov 
model was developed to evaluate the long-term clinical benefits and the 
costeffectiveness of the triple therapy from the Hungarian payer perspective. 
Model states were fibrosis (F0-F4, defined using METAVIR fibrosis scores), 
decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver 
transplantation (LT), and liver-related deaths (LD). Efficacy was estimated from 
SPRINT-2 and RESPOND-2 studies. Disease progression rates and health state 
utilities used in the model were obtained from published studies. Estimates of 
probability of liver transplantation and cost were based on an analysis of the 
Hungarian Sick Fund database. All cost and benefits were discounted at 5% per 
year. Results: Compared to dual therapy, triple therapy was projected to 
increase the life expectancy by 0.98 and 2.42 life years and increase the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) by 0.59 and 1.13 in treatment-naive and 
treatment-experienced patients, respectively. The corresponding incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were HUF7,747,962 (€26,717) and HUF5,888,240 (€20,304) 
per QALY. The lifetime incidence of severe liver disease events (DC, HCC, LT, 
LD) were projected to decrease by 45% and 61% in treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients treated with triple therapy groups in comparison 
with PEG-RBV treatment. Conclusion: The addition of boceprevir to standard 
therapy for the treatment of patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection in 
Hungary is projected to be cost-effective using a commonly used willingness to 
pay threshold of HUF 8.46 million (3 times gross domestic product per capita).

BACKGROUND: The lack of adequate on-farm storage facilities is one of the 
leading causes of enormous postharvest losses of fresh commodities, negatively 
affecting farmers' livelihoods and the sector's economic contribution. The aim 
of the current study was to develop and evaluate a solar-powered earth air heat 
exchanger cum evaporative cooling (EAHE-EC) system as an energy-efficient method 
for the storage of fresh produce for smallholders.
RESULTS: The postharvest quality parameters of tomatoes stored under ambient 
storage (AS) and in an EAHE-EC system were assessed at regular time intervals 
during storage. These include weight loss, total soluble solids, titratable 
acidity, fruit firmness, color, pH, ascorbic acid, lycopene content, total 
phenolic acid, and antioxidant activity. The average temperature and relative 
humidity inside the EAHE-EC system varied from 20.59 to 22.61 °C and 82.60% to 
89.43%, respectively, in comparison with AS (26.39-39.21 °C and 22.09-43.58%). 
Storage methods and time had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on tomato quality. 
Based on the retention of the overall quality until the end of the storage 
period, the shelf life of tomatoes was recorded as 21 days in the EAHE-EC 
system, which was 1.5 times more than AS (14 days).
CONCLUSIONS: The extra shelf-life gained by tomatoes in the EAHE-EC system may 
provide a sufficient buffer period for smallholders for retailing and marketing. 
This suggests that the developed system can maintain postharvest quality and 
increase the shelf life of tomatoes. It therefore has potential as an 
energy-efficient system for the storage of fruits and vegetables, including 
tomatoes. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND: In the pivotal LIBERTY 1 and 2 trials and long-term extension study, 
once-daily relugolix combination therapy (40 mg relugolix, 1 mg estradiol, 0.5 
mg norethindrone acetate) reduced menstrual blood loss volume and pain among 
women with uterine fibroids. Relugolix combination therapy was well tolerated 
with preservation of bone mineral density through 52 weeks.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to report the 2-year relugolix combination therapy 
efficacy and safety results of the phase 3 LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study.
STUDY DESIGN: Women with uterine fibroid-associated heavy menstrual bleeding who 
completed the 24-week LIBERTY 1 or 2 trials, followed by the 28-week long-term 
extension study (up to 52 weeks total treatment), and who met the responder 
criteria (menstrual blood loss volume <80 mL and ≥50% reduction from pivotal 
study baseline at week 48 [week 24 of long-term extension]) were randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to either blinded treatment with relugolix combination therapy or 
placebo for 52 weeks (total treatment period, 104 weeks). For women who had a 
relapse of heavy menstrual bleeding during the study (menstrual blood loss 
volume ≥80 mL), open-label relugolix combination therapy was offered. The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of women who maintained menstrual blood loss 
volume <80 mL through week 76 (week 24 of randomized withdrawal study). 
Secondary endpoints included time to menstrual blood loss volume ≥80 mL, 
proportion of women who maintained a menstrual blood loss volume of <80 mL 
through week 104 (over the 52-week randomized treatment period), the proportion 
of women who achieved or maintained amenorrhea at week 76 at the end of 
treatment, and the change in Uterine Fibroid Symptom-Quality of Life Bleeding 
and Pelvic Discomfort Scale and symptom severity scores. Analyses were performed 
for the modified intent-to-treat population, including all randomized women who 
received ≥1 dose of the study drug.
RESULTS: Of the 229 randomized women (relugolix combination therapy, n=115; 
placebo, n=114), 228 received the study drug and 175 (76.7%) completed the 
randomized withdrawal study. Through week 76, 78.4% of women on relugolix 
combination therapy maintained menstrual blood loss volume <80 mL vs 15.1% in 
the placebo group (difference, 63.4%; 95% confidence interval, 52.9%-73.9%; 
P<.0001). At week 104, 69.8% of women on relugolix combination therapy 
maintained menstrual blood loss volume <80 mL vs 11.8% in the placebo group 
(difference, 58.0%; 95% confidence interval, 47.0%-69.1%; P<.0001). Through week 
104, 88.3% of women on placebo relapsed with heavy menstrual bleeding (median 
time to relapse, 5.9 weeks). Among the 89 women in the placebo group who 
relapsed and received open-label rescue treatment, 87 women responded to 
relugolix combination therapy with a menstrual blood loss volume <80 mL. The 
proportion of women who achieved or maintained amenorrhea were 57.4% vs 13.3% at 
week 76 (difference, 44.1%; 95% confidence interval, 33.10%-55.1%; P<.0001) and 
58.3% vs 10.6% at week 104 (difference, 47.6%; 95% confidence interval, 
37.0%-58.3%; nominal P<.0001) for relugolix combination therapy and the placebo 
group, respectively. Relugolix combination therapy was generally well tolerated; 
no new safety signals were identified, and the adverse event profile over the 
second year was consistent with that reported through the first year of 
treatment. Bone mineral density remained stable in women who received relugolix 
combination therapy from week 52 to week 104. In women continuously treated with 
relugolix combination therapy up to 2 years, bone mineral density was generally 
preserved.
CONCLUSION: After 2 years of treatment with relugolix combination therapy, there 
was evidence of durability of the effect in maintaining low menstrual blood loss 
volume in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Most women had return of 
heavy menstrual bleeding and associated symptoms after treatment cessation, 
which improved upon retreatment with relugolix combination therapy. Relugolix 
combination therapy was well tolerated, the adverse event profile remained 
consistent, and the mean bone mineral density was generally preserved through 2 
years of treatment.

Since 2007, diamide insecticides have been widely used in Korea to control 
various types of lepidopteran pests including Spodoptera exigua. For nearly a 
decade, diamide resistance in field populations of S. exigua across 18 
localities has been monitored using bioassays. Despite their short history of 
use, resistance to diamide insecticides has emerged. Based on the LC50 values, 
some field populations showed a higher level of resistance to 
chlorantraniliprole, a diamide insecticide, compared to that of the susceptible 
strain, although regional and temporal variations were observed. To investigate 
resistance at a molecular level, we examined three mutations (Y4701C, I4790M, 
and G4946E) in the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which is the primary mechanism 
underlying diamide insecticide resistance. DNA sequencing showed that only the 
I4790M mutation was found in most field populations. As resistance levels varied 
significantly despite the uniform presence of the I4790M mutation, we considered 
the presence of another resistance factor. Further, the I4790M mutation was also 
found in S. exigua specimens collected prior to the commercialization of diamide 
insecticides in Korea as well as in other countries, such as the USA. This 
finding led us to hypothesize that the I4790M mutation were predisposed in field 
populations owing to selection factors other than diamide use. For further 
clarification, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of S. exigua (449.83 Mb) and 
re-sequencing of 18 individual whole genomes. However, no additional 
non-synonymous mutations were detected in the RyR-coding region. Therefore, we 
concluded that the high level of diamide insecticide resistance in Korean S. 
exigua is not caused by mutations at the target site, RyR, but is attributed to 
other factors that need to be investigated in future studies.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
adding pembrolizumab to the standard first-line therapy of advanced biliary 
tract cancer (BTC) with gemcitabine and cisplatin from the perspective of the 
Chinese healthcare system.
METHODS: The partitioned survival model developed from clinical data obtained in 
The KEYNOTE-966 trial served as the basis for a simulation in the TreeAge Pro 
2011 software. The objective of the research was to estimate the 10-year life 
expectancy and total healthcare costs of patients with BTC, utilizing primary 
outcomes that evaluated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). To establish the willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) threshold, the 2022 Chinese per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of 
$37304.346/QALY was adopted. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
ascertain the study's results under varying levels of uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to chemotherapy alone, the addition of pembrolizumab to 
chemotherapy has been shown to yield an incremental gain of 0.184 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an additional cost of $103940.706. This 
translates into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$564895.141/QALY, which exceeds the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold in China. 
One-way sensitivity analyses performed on the model recognize the utility of PD, 
subsequent cost, and the cost of Pembrolizumab 100 mg had a major influence on 
the outcomes. However, no parameter elicited an ICER lower than the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, the 
utilization of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as an first-line 
treatment option for BTC does not appear to be a cost-effective approach 
compared to chemotherapy as a standalone therapy.

BACKGROUND: Measuring life expectancy and life disparity can assist in 
comprehending how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mortality estimates in 
the Indian population. The present study aims to study the life expectancy and 
life disparity at birth at the national and subnational levels before and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic using the NFHS and SRS data.
METHODS: The measures Life expectancy at birth ([Formula: see text]) and Life 
disparity at birth ([Formula: see text]) were computed for the non-pandemic and 
pandemic years from NFHS (2015-16), SRS (2015) and NFHS (2019-21), SRS (2020) 
respectively at the national and Subnational level in India. Using NFHS data for 
the 36 states and SRS data for the 22 states, the study calculates [Formula: see 
text] and [Formula: see text] by total, male and female population.
RESULTS: The [Formula: see text] for male and female decline from 64.3 years and 
69.2 years in 2015-16 to 62.9 years and 68.9 years in 2019-21. The [Formula: see 
text] shows a drop of approximately 1.4 years for males and 0.3 years for 
females in the pandemic year 2019-21 when compared to the non-pandemic year 
2015-16. At the subnational level [Formula: see text] shows a decline for 22 
states in person, 23 states in males and 21 states in females in the pandemic 
year 2019-21 as compared to the non-pandemic years 2015-16. The [Formula: see 
text] shows a increase for 21 states in person, 24 states in females and 17 
states in males in the pandemic year than non-pandemic year. The findings shows 
a significant losses in [Formula: see text] and gains in [Formula: see text] for 
males than females in the pandemic year as compared to the non-pandemic year at 
the subnational level in India.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has decreased [Formula: see text] and increased 
[Formula: see text] in the pandemic year 2019-21 at the national and subnational 
level in India. COVID-19 had a significant impact on the age pattern of 
mortality for many states and male, female population and delayed the mortality 
transition in India.

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of radial extracorporeal shock 
wave therapy (rESWT) and conventional physical therapy (CPT) protocol on the 
gait pattern in stroke survivors through a new gait analysis technology. Fifteen 
(n=15) stroke survivors took part in this prospective, observational study and 
were assessed clinically and through an instrumented treadmill before and after 
rESWT and CPT. Spasticity grade 95% CI 0.93 (0.79 +/- 1.08), pain intensity 95% 
CI 1.60 (1.19 +/- 2.01), and clonus score decreased significantly 95% CI 1.13 
(0.72 +/- 1.54). The sensorimotor function 95% CI -2.53 (-3.42 +/- 1.65), 
balance 95% CI -5.67 (-6.64 +/- - 4.69), and gait parameters were enhanced at 
the end of the program. Step length 95% CI -3.47 (-6.48 +/- 0.46) and step cycle 
were improved 95% CI -0.09 (-0.17 +/- -0.01), and hip 95% CI -3.90 (-6.92 +/- 
-0.88), knee 95% CI -2.08 (-3.84 +/- -0.32) and ankle flexion-extension 95% CI 
-2.08 (-6.64 +/- -4.69) were augmented. Adding the quantitative analysis to the 
clinical assessment, we gained easy access to track progress and obtained an 
individualized therapeutic approach for stroke survivors.

Conflict of interest statement: We confirm that we have read the Journal’s 
position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report 
is consistent with those guidelines. Stroke is one of the leading causes of 
long-term disability in adults worldwide with an increasing number of persons 
affected by this condition. Stroke related impairments such as spasticity, 
muscle weakness, pain, sensorimotor deficits, and poor balance can often lead to 
a decreased tolerance to daily life activities, autonomy restriction, and 
sedentary lifestyle., Gait is a complex task and parameters such as 
spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic variables are often modified in patients 
with walking disorders. Currently, new technological gait analysis systems offer 
the possibility of creating a database, reproducible results, and easy access 
for tracking progress and efficacy of neurorehabilitation programs through 
telerehabilitation (TR) implementation in the clinical practice, especially 
since the COVID-19 pandemic context., Quantitative gait analysis systems include 
instrumented treadmills as a new alternative to previous overground gait 
analysis systems, and also promote the assessments and effective therapeutic 
delivery of care to neurological patients after discharge.,, Objective, 
quantitative parameters are needed to ensure good quality in clinical practice 
since the most commonly used methods for gait analysis were based either on 
visual observation or questionnaires, which are considered poorly reliable and 
insufficient methods. Currently, the gold standard for measuring and evaluating 
spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters is represented by various 3D motion 
capture systems., Poor balance control and gait impairments interfere with 
standing and walking ability in stroke survivors. Gait dynamics changes its 
pattern especially in stroke survivors due to increased muscle tone and balance 
impairment. Early detection and assessment of gait anomalies through gait 
analysis systems evaluate stride length and duration, lower limb range of motion 
(ROM), limb symmetry or asymmetry, providing objective parameters and ensuring 
evaluation of progress and recovery during the rehabilitation program. Usually, 
the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients is a long-term process involving 
multiple assessments. However, during the pandemic of COVID-19, the access to 
healthcare delivery throughout the world has been significantly impacted 
creating collateral damages for both, rehabilitation facilities and stroke 
survivors. One of the key changes implemented by the health care systems in 
order to promote rehabilitation continuity, was the rapid expansion of several 
TR programs and tele-assessments strategies., Systems such as newly instrumented 
treadmills for spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic parameters assessment with 
good levels of agreement, seem a new alternative to previous overground gait 
analysis systems. Integrating clinical assessment and virtual evaluation can 
easily offer objective data by tracking progress and also give the possibility 
to a tailored treatment for patients based on their performance at different
