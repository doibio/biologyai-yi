Usually, population aging is measured to inform fiscal and social planning 
because it is considered to indicate the burden that an elderly population 
presents to the economic, social security, and health systems of a society. 
Measures of population aging are expected to indicate shifts in the distribution 
of individuals' attributes (e.g., chronological age, health) within a population 
that are relevant to assessing the burden. We claim that chronological age - 
even though it is the attribute most broadly used - may frequently not be the 
best measure to satisfy this purpose. A distribution of chronological age per se 
does not present a burden. Rather, burdens arise from the characteristics that 
supposedly or actually accompany chronological ages. We posit that in addition 
to chronological age, meaningful measures of population aging should reflect, 
for instance, the distribution of economic productivity, health, functional 
capacities, or biological age, as these attributes may more directly assess the 
burden on the socioeconomic and health systems. Here, we illustrate some 
limitations of measures of population aging based on each kind of measure, 
including chronological age, and review alternative measures that may better 
inform fiscal, social, and health planning.

OBJECTIVEAdult spinal deformity surgery is an effective way of treating pain and 
disability, but little research has been done to evaluate the costs associated 
with changes in health outcome measures. This study determined the change in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the cost per QALY in patients undergoing 
spinal deformity surgery in the unique environment of a military healthcare 
system (MHS).METHODSPatients were enrolled between 2011 and 2017. Patients were 
eligible to participate if they were undergoing a thoracolumbar spinal fusion 
spanning more than 6 levels to treat an underlying deformity. Patients completed 
the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) prior to surgery and 6 and 12 
months after surgery. The authors used paired t-tests to compare SF-36 Physical 
Component Summary (PCS) scores between baseline and postsurgery. To estimate the 
cost per QALY of complex spine surgery in this population, the authors extended 
the change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between baseline and 
follow-up over 5 years. Data on the cost of surgery were obtained from the MHS 
and include all facility and physician costs.RESULTSHRQOL and surgical data were 
available for 49 of 91 eligible patients. Thirty-one patients met additional 
criteria allowing for cost-effectiveness analysis. Over 12 months, patients 
demonstrated significant improvement (p < 0.01) in SF-36 PCS scores. A majority 
of patients met the minimum clinically important difference (MCID; 83.7%) and 
substantive clinical benefit threshold (SCBT; 83.7%). The average change in QALY 
was an increase of 0.08. Extended across 5 years, including the 3.5% discounting 
per year, study participants increased their QALYs by 0.39, resulting in an 
average cost per QALY of $181,649.20. Nineteen percent of patients met the < 
$100,000/QALY threshold with half of the patients meeting the < $100,000/QALY 
mark by 10 years. A sensitivity analysis showed that patients who scored below 
60 on their preoperative SF-36 PCS had an average increase in QALYs of 0.10 per 
year or 0.47 over 5 years.CONCLUSIONSWith a 5-year extended analysis, patients 
who receive spinal deformity surgery in the MHS increased their QALYs by 0.39, 
with 19% of patients meeting the $100,000/QALY threshold. The majority of 
patients met the threshold for MCID and SCBT at 1 year postoperatively. 
Consideration of preoperative functional status (SF-36 PCS score < 60) may be an 
important factor in determining which patients benefit the most from spinal 
deformity surgery.

In-vehicle applications that are based on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) 
communication technologies need to be evaluated under lab-controlled conditions 
before performing field tests. The need for a tailored platform to perform 
specific research on the cooperative Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) 
to assess the effect on driver behavior and driving performance motivated the 
development of a driver-centric traffic simulator that is built over a 3D 
graphics engine. The engine creates a driving situation as it communicates with 
a traffic simulator as a means to simulate real-life traffic scenarios. The 
TraCI as a Service (TraaS) library was implemented to perform the interaction 
between the driver-controlled vehicle and the Simulation of Urban MObility 
(SUMO). An extension of a previous version, this work improves simulation 
performance and realism by reducing computational demand and integrating a 
tailored scenario with the ADAS to be tested. The usability of the implemented 
simulation platform was evaluated by means of an experiment related to the 
efficiency of a Traffic Light Assistant (TLA), showing the analysis of the 
answer that 80% of the participants were satisfied with the simulator and the 
TLA system implemented.

Reduction of insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling (IIS) extends 
the lifespan of various species. So far, several longevity mouse models have 
been developed containing mutations related to growth signaling deficiency by 
targeting growth hormone (GH), IGF1, IGF1 receptor, insulin receptor, and 
insulin receptor substrate. In addition, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 
(S6K1) knockout leads to lifespan extension. S6K1 encodes an important kinase in 
the regulation of cell growth. S6K1 is regulated by mechanistic target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. The v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog 
(MYC)-deficient mice also exhibits a longevity phenotype. The gene expression 
profiles of these mice models have been measured to identify their longevity 
mechanisms. Here, we summarize our knowledge of long-lived mouse models related 
to growth and discuss phenotypic characteristics, including organ-specific gene 
expression patterns. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(1): 70-85].

New Cancer Drug Approvals From the Perspective of a Universal Healthcare System: 
Analyses of the Pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review Recommendations.

Niraula S, Nugent Z.

Background: FDA approvals do not consider cost, but they set the tone for 
regulatory approvals worldwide, including in countries with universal healthcare 
where cost-effectiveness, utility, and adoption feasibility are considered 
rigorously. Methods: Data from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR), a 
national drug review system that makes evidence-based funding recommendations to 
Canada's provinces and territories, were collected. Our objectives were to 
assess (1) temporal trends in cost and efficacy of drugs reviewed, (2) 
correlations among magnitude of benefits, cost, and pCODR decisions, and (3) 
predictors of approvals. Results: A total of 60 drugs for 91 indications were 
reviewed by pCODR from January 2012 to January 2018. Of the 91 reviews (approved 
previously by FDA), 18 received negative recommendations on the grounds of 
inadequate clinical benefits; 87% (64/73) of those approved were conditional on 
improvement in cost. Surrogate outcomes were used to support approvals in 83% of 
the reviews, which were not correlated with overall survival (rSpearman = +0.16; 
P=.24). Median cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) increased by 36% per 
annum (quantile regression, P=.0029), although benefits in overall and 
progression-free survival were stable (P=.21 and .65, respectively). 
Median-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of new drugs was 
$186,403 CAD (range, $7,200 to $2.1 million). Higher ICER was a strong predictor 
of a negative pCODR recommendation (P<.01). Conclusions: A substantial number of 
cancer drugs that are FDA approved for public use do not meet Canadian standards 
for efficacy. Cost of cancer drugs increases by a third annually in Canada, but 
the benefits-measured mostly with surrogates that did not correlate with 
survival-are stable. With finite resources to share among multiple societal 
priorities, such as education and preventive health, cancer drug cost may be 
unsustainable despite price regulation.

A 13-year-old boy was found unconscious. Ventricular fibrillation was seen in 
his admission to the emergency room. Dilated right coronary artery and increased 
coronary arterial flow were seen in echocardiography. In the angiography, left 
coronary artery abnormally arising from pulmonary artery and aneursymatic 
dilatation in the right coronary artery was seen. <Learning objective: Anomalous 
left coronary artery arising from pulmonary artery is one of the rare reasons 
for myocardial ischemia in childhood. Life expectancy can be normal which 
depends largely on the number of collaterals that are present between right and 
left coronary arteries. However, sudden death risk always exists.>.

According to the WHO, by 2025 Brazil will be ranked sixth in the world in terms 
of proportion of elderly in the population. Within this scope, cognition plays a 
central role in the aging process, having an important association with quality 
of life, which suggests the need to develop intervention programs, such as 
cognitive training.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a program of cognitive stimulation 
workshops on the self-esteem and cognition of elderly people.
METHODS: Thirty-eight elderly subjects completed the three-step protocol: 1) 
Survey of demographic data and evaluation of cognition by a neuropsychological 
battery and of self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSS), prior to 
training; 2) Participation in twelve cognitive stimulation workshops; and 3) 
Cognitive evaluation and RSS after the training.
RESULTS: Results showed that the use of training produced positive effects on 
cognitive test performance of the elderly with and without cognitive impairment. 
By extension, this demonstrates positive impact on their self-esteem.
CONCLUSION: These findings encourage investment in cognitive stimulation 
programs as a resource for improved cognition and quality of life for the 
elderly. Subjective cognitive complaint may have served as a predictor of 
decreased self-esteem; therefore, as training improved cognition, it also 
improved self-esteem.

Publisher: Segundo a OMS, em 2025 o Brasil ficará em sexto lugar no ranking 
mundial em termos de proporção de idosos na população. Nesse âmbito, a cognição 
desempenha um papel central no processo de envelhecimento, tendo uma importante 
associação com a qualidade de vida, o que sugere a necessidade de desenvolver 
programas de intervenção, como o treinamento cognitivo.
OBJETIVO: Determinar os efeitos de um programa de oficinas de estimulação 
cognitiva na autoestima e cognição de idosos.
MÉTODOS: Trinta e oito idosos completaram o protocolo de três etapas: 1) 
Levantamento de dados demográficos e avaliação da cognição por uma bateria 
neuropsicológica e de autoestima utilizando a Escala de Autoestima de Rosenberg 
(RSS), antes do treinamento; 2) Participação em doze oficinas de estimulação 
cognitiva; e 3) Avaliação cognitiva e RSS após o treinamento.
RESULTADOS: Os resultados mostraram que o uso de treinamento produziu efeitos 
positivos no desempenho do teste cognitivo de idosos com e sem comprometimento 
cognitivo. Por extensão, isso demonstra um impacto positivo em sua autoestima.
CONCLUSÃO: Estes resultados encorajam o investimento em programas de estimulação 
cognitiva como um recurso para melhorar a cognição e a qualidade de vida dos 
idosos. Queixa cognitiva subjetiva pode ter servido como um preditor de 
diminuição da autoestima; portanto, como o treinamento melhorou a cognição, 
também melhorou a autoestima.

There is an increasing proportion of individuals aged 70 years and older, as 
well as an increasing life expectancy worldwide. The present study may guide the 
management of older patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA). The 
medical records of 241 older men aged >70 years who underwent multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before prostate biopsy (PBx) at our 
institution were reviewed retrospectively. Multiple variables were evaluated as 
predictors for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). The variables included 
serum PSA level, digital rectal examination, size of region of interest on 
mpMRI, prostate volume and PSA density. PCa was positive in 162 (67.2%). 
Prostate volume and PSA density were significant PCa predictors (P<0.001). In 
patients aged 70-75 and >75 years, PSA density was significantly higher in 
patients with PCa (0.21 ng/ml/cc, P=0.014 and 0.24 ng/ml/cc, P<0.001, 
respectively). Similarly, PSA density was significant higher in patients with 
significant PCa (0.24 ng/ml/cc, P=0.004 and 0.29 ng/ml/cc, P<0.001, 
respectively). The cut-off value of PSA density was calculated using receiver 
operating characteristic curves. Area under curve of PSA density was 0.698, and 
the best cut-off value was 0.20 ng/ml/cc. These results indicate that the 
combination of PSA density with mpMRI before PBx is a helpful method and can be 
a decision-making model for a selection of PBx.

In healthy tissue, the tight junction protein Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) is present 
only in the gastric mucosa. Upon malignant transformation of gastric epithelial 
tissue, perturbations in cell polarity lead to cell surface exposure of CLDN18.2 
epitopes. Moreover, CLDN18.2 is aberrantly expressed in malignancies of several 
other organs, such as pancreatic cancer (PC). A monoclonal antibody, 
zolbetuximab (formerly known as IMAB362), has been generated against CLDN18.2. 
In a phase 2 clinical trial (FAST: NCT01630083), zolbetuximab in conjunction 
with chemotherapy prolonged overall and progression-free survival over 
chemotherapy alone and improved quality of life. In this study, the mechanism of 
action and antitumor activity of zolbetuximab were investigated using 
nonclinical PC models. Zolbetuximab bound specifically and with strong affinity 
to human PC cells that expressed CLDN18.2 on the cell surface. In ex vivo 
systems using immune effector cells and serum from healthy donors, zolbetuximab 
induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC), resulting in the lysis of cultured human PC cells. The 
amplitude of ADCC and CDC directly correlated with cell surface CLDN18.2 levels. 
The chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine upregulated CLDN18.2 expression in 
cultured human PC cells and enhanced zolbetuximab-induced ADCC. In mouse 
xenograft tumors derived from human PC cell lines, including 
gemcitabine-refractory ones, zolbetuximab slowed tumor growth, benefited 
survival, and attenuated metastases development. The results presented here 
validate CLDN18.2 as a targetable biomarker in PC and support extension of the 
clinical development of zolbetuximab to patients with CLDN18.2-expressing PC.

BACKGROUND: Chordomas are rare malignant tumors of the spinal column often 
afflicting the upper cervical spine and sacrum. There are few large single 
center series on chordomas due to its rarity. The purpose of this study is to 
report a single center's experience with the operative and non-operative 
management of chordomas.
METHODS: We evaluated our institution's pathology database from 1994 to 2016 to 
identify patients diagnosed with chordomas. Inclusion criteria were chordomas of 
the mobile spine and sacrum. Exclusion criteria were chordomas of the clivus and 
resection performed at another institution. We collected patient demographics as 
well as the type of resection performed, intra-operative complications, wound 
complications and recurrence/prognosis.
RESULTS: We identified 18 patients diagnosed with chordomas at our institution, 
and 12 met our inclusion criteria. There were four females and eight males with 
an average age of 64 [32-87] years. All patients were Caucasian and 10 of the 12 
had surgery. Of the two patients with sacral chordomas that did not have 
surgery, one received chemotherapy and the other did not elect for any 
treatment. One is alive 161 months following diagnosis and the second died 96 
months following diagnosis. Five of the lesions were in the mobile spine (one 
cervical, two thoracic, two lumbar) and seven were in the sacrum. Six patients 
underwent an en bloc resection [two via total en bloc spondylectomy (TES)]. 
Average length of follow up is 60 [3-161] months and eight of 12 patients are 
alive at latest follow up. Intraoperative complications included cardiac arrest, 
pleural tear, and excessive blood loss (8 L). Two patients, with sacral 
chordomas, had wound complications. Recurrence occurred in one patient with 
piecemeal resection and one patient with incomplete resection had post-operative 
metastatic lesions to the liver and lung.
CONCLUSIONS: We found less recurrence in patients managed with an en bloc 
resection as opposed to piece meal or intralesional resections. Sacral chordoma 
patients had higher wound complication rates as compared to chordomas of the 
mobile spine. The long life expectancy of non-surgically managed patients 
underscores the indolent nature of chordomas.

Cardiovascular disease, rare in premenopausal women, increases sharply at 
menopause and is typically accompanied by chronic inflammation. Previous work in 
our laboratory demonstrated that replacing senescent ovaries in 
post-reproductive mice with young, actively cycling ovaries restored many health 
benefits, including decreased cardiomyopathy and restoration of immune function. 
Our objective here was to determine if depletion of germ cells from young 
transplanted ovaries would alter the ovarian-dependent extension of life and 
health span. Sixty-day-old germ cell-depleted and germ cell-containing ovaries 
were transplanted to post-reproductive, 17-month-old mice. Mean life span for 
female CBA/J mice is approximately 644 days. Mice that received germ 
cell-containing ovaries lived 798 days (maximum = 815 days). Mice that received 
germ cell-depleted ovaries lived 880 days (maximum = 1046 days), 29% further 
past the time of surgery than mice that received germ cell-containing ovaries. 
The severity of inflammation was reduced in all mice that received young 
ovaries, whether germ cell-containing or germ cell-depleted. Aging-associated 
inflammatory cytokine changes were reversed in post-reproductive mice by 
4 months of new-ovary exposure. In summary, germ cell depletion enhanced the 
longevity-extending effects of the young, transplanted ovaries and, as with germ 
cell-containing ovaries, decreased the severity of inflammation, but did so 
independent of germ cells. Based on these observations, we propose that gonadal 
somatic cells are programed to preserve the somatic health of the organism with 
the intent of facilitating future germline transmission. As reproductive 
potential decreases or is lost, the incentive to preserve the somatic health of 
the organism is lost as well.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the 
institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the company that 
makes obinutuzumab (Roche Products Limited) to submit evidence of the clinical 
and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with chemotherapy, with or 
without obinutuzumab as maintenance therapy for adult patients with untreated, 
advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) in the UK. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 
(KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to 
act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's 
submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The clinical 
evidence was derived from two phase III, company-sponsored, randomised, 
open-label studies. Most evidence on obinutuzumab was based on the GALLIUM trial 
that compared obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as induction 
followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy with rituximab in combination 
with chemotherapy as induction followed by rituximab maintenance monotherapy in 
previously untreated patients with FL (grades 1-3a). Long-term clinical evidence 
was based on the PRIMA trial, studying the benefit of two years of rituximab 
maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with FL. The 
cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company relied on a partitioned 
survival cost-utility model, implemented in Microsoft® Excel. The base-case 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented in the company submission 
was <£20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Although the ERG 
concluded that the economic model met the NICE reference case to a reasonable 
extent, some errors were identified and several assumptions made by the company 
were challenged. A new base-case scenario produced by the ERG suggested an ICER 
that was higher than the company base case, but still below £30,000 per QALY 
gained. However, some ERG scenario analyses were close to or even above the 
threshold. This was the case in particular for assuming a treatment effect that 
did not extend beyond trial follow-up. These results led to an initial negative 
recommendation by the appraisal committee. Subsequently, the company submitted a 
revised base case focusing on patients at intermediate or high risk of premature 
mortality. Simultaneously, a further price discount for obinutuzumab was 
granted. In addition to the company's revised base case, the ERG suggested a 
restriction of the treatment effect to 5 years and implemented biosimilar uptake 
and cheaper prices for rituximab. All of these adjustments did not exceed 
£30,000 per QALY gained and therefore the use of obinutuzumab for patients with 
advanced FL and a Follicular Lymphoma International Predictive Index (FLIPI) 
score of two or more could be recommended.

As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Merck Sharp & 
Dohme) of pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost 
effectiveness for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
cancer where cisplatin is unsuitable. The School of Health and Related Research 
Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to 
act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed 
review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the 
technology, based on the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical 
effectiveness evidence in the CS for pembrolizumab was based on one phase II, 
single-arm, open-label, non-randomised study (KEYNOTE-052), while the evidence 
for the comparator (carboplatin plus gemcitabine) was based on four studies, 
including one randomised controlled trial and three cohort studies. In the 
absence of head-to-head trials, the company conducted an indirect treatment 
comparison for both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), 
by firstly adjusting cross-study differences using a simulated treatment 
comparison approach and then synthesizing the evidence based on an assumption of 
constant hazard ratios using a standard meta-analysis model and time-varying 
hazard ratios using fractional polynomial models. The treatment effect of 
pembrolizumab was more favourable in the adjusted population compared with the 
observed effect in the KEYNOTE-052 study. The company submitted a de novo 
partitioned survival cohort simulation model, which partitions the OS time into 
PFS and post-progression survival. The probabilistic incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with carboplatin plus 
gemcitabine was estimated to be £37,081 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained, based on the results within the company's health economic model. 
Following a critique of the model, for their preferred base case the ERG 
corrected some minor model errors, chose a progression approach for estimating 
utilities, and revised the extrapolation of PFS and OS. The ERG's probabilistic 
base case ICER was estimated to be £67,068 per QALY gained. The ERG also 
undertook a range of exploratory sensitivity analyses which suggested that the 
ICER was highly uncertain. In particular, the choices of extrapolation for the 
OS of pembrolizumab and the stopping rule for pembrolizumab had the largest 
impacts on the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended pembrolizumab for 
use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing 
chemotherapy, provided that pembrolizumab was stopped at 2 years of 
uninterrupted treatment, or earlier if the disease progresses, and the 
conditions of the managed access agreement for pembrolizumab are followed.

OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the therapy 
of choice for treating severe aortic stenosis in patients at high-risk for 
surgery or where it is considered too risky to attempt. This uptake varies 
across geographies however, and its cost or value has frequently been cited as 
the reason for this. We sought to evaluate the potential cost and clinical 
impact of TAVI in intermediate risk patients from a French collective 
perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was performed using a novel Markov model 
with data derived from the PARTNER II randomized controlled trial for survival, 
clinical event rates, and quality-of-life. The simulated time horizon was 
15 years, costs were from French sources and presented in 2016 Euros. 
Discounting of all outcomes was at 4% annually and the effect of uncertainty in 
model parameters was explored by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: In comparison to surgery, TAVI resulted in improved clinical outcomes 
(life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy) and lower costs over a 
lifetime time horizon. The base case results showed increases of 0.42 years and 
0.41 QALYs with lifetime cost savings of €439 for TAVI compared to surgery. PSA 
results showed a >50% likelihood of cost-effectiveness at €0 willingness-to-pay 
and a 100% likelihood at ∼€15,000.
LIMITATIONS: Clinically, survival projections are based on limited follow-up 
data and introduce uncertainty into the outcomes from the model. Economically, 
procedure costs are derived from a heterogeneous mix of patient risk groups, 
although this is much more likely to bias against TAVI and under-estimate 
overall cost savings.
CONCLUSIONS: In our analyses of intermediate risk patients, TAVI is associated 
with superior clinical outcomes compared to surgery and is cost saving. It could 
be expected that cost savings are conservative and likely to increase over time.

The main data on HIV in high-income countries from the standpoint of health 
economics are updated and discussed. Specifically, issues surrounding the 
economic impact of HIV are addressed for health care and occupational 
perspectives. We review the main epidemiological data on the prevalence of 
disease and foreseeable changes in patterns within the coming years. Recent 
research on health care costs of HIV/AIDS and the occupational situation of HIV+ 
people are discussed. In high-income countries, there is an incipient change in 
trends that indicate that an increasing percentage of the intermediate-age HIV+ 
population will age prematurely, presenting more frequently comorbidities and 
becoming more exposed to frailty situations. Accordingly, health-care systems 
should have to plan their resources to accommodate new determinants of 
healthcare costs in the HIV+ population. On the occupational side, the decreased 
life expectancy of HIV+ persons, coupled with more severe health issues, on 
average may prompt early -retirement of this population from the labor market.

Stem/progenitor cell transplantation delivery of astrocytes is a potentially 
powerful strategy for spinal cord injury (SCI). Axon extension into SCI lesions 
that occur spontaneously or in response to experimental manipulations is often 
observed along endogenous astrocyte "bridges," suggesting that augmenting this 
response via astrocyte lineage transplantation can enhance axon regrowth. Given 
the importance of respiratory dysfunction post-SCI, we transplanted 
glial-restricted precursors (GRPs)-a class of lineage-restricted astrocyte 
progenitors-into the C2 hemisection model and evaluated effects on diaphragm 
function and the growth response of descending rostral ventral respiratory group 
(rVRG) axons that innervate phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs). GRPs survived long 
term and efficiently differentiated into astrocytes in injured spinal cord. GRPs 
promoted significant recovery of diaphragm electromyography amplitudes and 
stimulated robust regeneration of injured rVRG axons. Although rVRG fibers 
extended across the lesion, no regrowing axons re-entered caudal spinal cord to 
reinnervate PhMNs, suggesting that this regeneration response-although 
impressive-was not responsible for recovery. Within ipsilateral C3-5 ventral 
horn (PhMN location), GRPs induced substantial sprouting of spared fibers 
originating in contralateral rVRG and 5-HT axons that are important for 
regulating PhMN excitability; this sprouting was likely involved in functional 
effects of GRPs. Finally, GRPs reduced the macrophage response (which plays a 
key role in inducing axon retraction and limiting regrowth) both within the 
hemisection and at intact caudal spinal cord surrounding PhMNs. These findings 
demonstrate that astrocyte progenitor transplantation promotes significant 
plasticity of rVRG-PhMN circuitry and restoration of diaphragm function and 
suggest that these effects may be in part through immunomodulation.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The long-term population health impact of nicotine vaping 
products (NVPs) use among smokers is unknown, and subject to a range of 
plausible assumptions about the use and health consequences of NVPs. While NVPs 
use may substitute for cigarette smoking and thereby aid in quitting cigarette 
use, it is also possible that smokers who would have otherwise quit would 
instead delay quitting cigarettes. We aimed to develop a cohort-specific 
simulation model of the impact of NVPs on smoking cessation by adult smokers and 
resulting premature deaths (PD) and life years lost (LYL).
DESIGN: A cohort-specific simulation model of the impact of NVPs on smoking 
cessation by adult smokers and resulting premature deaths (PD) and life years 
lost (LYL) was developed by gender for two birth cohorts, aged 30 and 50 years 
in 2012. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted.
SETTING: United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Smokers in two birth cohorts, aged 30 and 50 years in 2012.
MEASUREMENTS: Data were from the 1965-2012 National Health Interview Surveys and 
the 2014/15 Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey. The model 
incorporated a range of plausible assumptions from published literature about 
transition rates from regular smoking to exclusive NVP and dual use, from dual 
use to exclusive NVP use and from exclusive NVP use to no use.
FINDINGS: Compared with the no-NVP scenario, the male (female) model projected 
17.8% (19.3%) fewer PDs and 22.9% (26.6%) fewer LYL for the 1982 cohort and 5.4% 
(7.3%) fewer PDs and 7.9% (11.4%) fewer LYL for the 1962 cohort. These gains 
were sensitive to NVP use over time, age of initial NVP use, transitions from 
smoking to dual, exclusive NVP and no use and relative NVP mortality risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine vaping product (NVP) use in the United States is projected 
to have a net positive impact on population health over a wide range of 
plausible levels of NVP use, transitions to dual, exclusive NVP and no use and 
NVP risks. However, net impact is sensitive to parameter estimates.

Change of Self-recognition about the Accuracy of Data on Okinawa in the 
Mizushima Prefectural Life Table: Influence of His "Pre-publication of the 
1921-25 Prefectural Life Table".

[Article in English, Japanese]

Ohmi K.

We examined the change in the self-recognition about the accuracy of data on 
Okinawa in the Mizushima Prefectural Life Table, and discussed:its relationship 
to the "Okinawa Is a Traditional Longevity Prefecture" theory. In the 
Prefectural Life Table made before WWII, Mizushima had suspended his judgment as 
to the reliability of infant mortality data in Okinawa. However, after the 
production of the "Proto-'1921-25' Life Table" in 1952-1954, Mizushima asserted 
that infant mortality data in Okinawa was incomplete and unreliable, and 
excluded Okinawa in his analysis in two times of the life table. On the other 
hand, the "Pre-publication of the 1921-25 Prefectural Life Table" was, in a way 
that ignores Mizushima's own interpretation, used as the basis of the "Okinawa 
Is a Traditional Longevity Prefecture" thesis used by the Ryukyu government in 
its occupation era, and in recent years by other commentators.

Specifying the Date when Mizushima Haruo Calculated His "Pre-publication of the

[Article in English, Japanese]

Ohmi K.

We examined the first appearing papers of a series of the Mizushima Prefectural 
Life Table and checked its publication history and the transition of 
manufacturing methods as a first step in order to examine the theory that life 
expectancy in Okinawa has been long from a long time ago. However, the 
Prefectural Life Table of 1921-25 was first published in 1960, and its original 
form (as the "Pre-publication of the 1921-25 Prefectural Life Table") was 
estimated to have been started after WWII and completed in 1952-1954, based on 
the publication history and the transition of the manufacturing methods. In our 
next publication we will examine the change in the self-recognition about the 
accuracy of data from Okinawa in the Mizushima Prefectural Life Table, and 
discuss its relationship to the "Okinawa Is a Traditional Longevity Prefecture" 
theory.

OBJECTIVE: Bone metastases are common among patients with advanced breast 
cancer, putting patients at increased risk of skeletal-related events (SREs). 
This study described impact of bone metastases, utilization of bone-targeted 
agents (BTAs) and physicians' decision processes for BTA use in advanced breast 
cancer.
METHODS: Data were collected using the Adelphi Breast Cancer Disease-Specific 
Programme in the United States. Physicians completed a detailed record for 
eligible patients (women ≥18 years, with stage IIIB-IV breast cancer).
RESULTS: Data available from 1276 patients with advanced breast cancer included 
485 (38%) with bone metastases. Most (80%) reported pain at bone metastasis 
diagnosis; of those reporting pain, 55% reported moderate to severe pain. Among 
patients with bone metastasis, 69% received a BTA. Reasons for initiating BTAs 
were bone pain (32%) and an estimated high risk of SREs (25%). Reasons for not 
treating with BTAs were very recent diagnosis (37%), poor Karnofsky performance 
status (14%), perceived low risk of SREs (11%) and short life expectancy (11%). 
Zoledronic acid (48%) and denosumab (42%) were commonly used BTAs; the main 
reasons for initiating BTA treatment were long-term safety (28% and 32%, 
respectively) and efficacy in delaying SREs (15% and 31%, respectively). The 
analysis was not adjusted for age or other possible confounders.
CONCLUSION: Bone pain is a common and sometimes severe symptom of bone 
metastases in advanced breast cancer and a common reason for initiating BTA 
treatment. Safety and efficacy were the main factors considered by physicians 
when selecting BTAs.

BACKGROUND: Given that dengue disease is growing and may progress to dengue 
hemorrhagic fever (DHF), data on economic cost and disease burden are important. 
However, data for Mexico are limited.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Burden of dengue fever (DF) and DHF in Mexico 
was assessed using official databases for epidemiological information, 
disabilities weights from Shepard et al, the reported number of cases and 
deaths, and costs. Overall costs of dengue were summed from direct medical costs 
to the health system, cost of dengue to the patient (out-of-pocket expenses 
[medical and non-medical], indirect costs [loss of earnings, patient and/or 
caregiver]), and other government expenditures on prevention/surveillance. The 
first three components, calculated as costs per case by a micro-costing approach 
(PAATI; program, actions, activities, tasks, inputs), were scaled up to overall 
cost using epidemiology data from official databases. PAATI was used to 
calculate cost of vector control and prevention, education, and epidemiological 
surveillance, based on an expert consensus and normative construction of an 
ideal scenario. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for Mexico in 2016 were 
calculated to be 2283.46 (1.87 per 100,000 inhabitants). Overall economic impact 
of dengue in Mexico for 2012 was US$144 million, of which US$44 million 
corresponded to direct medical costs and US$5 million to the costs from the 
patient's perspective. The estimated cost of prevention/surveillance was 
calculated with information provided by federal government to be US$95 million. 
The overall economic impact of DF and DHF showed an increase in 2013 to US$161 
million and a decrease to US$133, US$131 and US$130 million in 2014, 2015 and 
2016, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The medical and economic impact of dengue were in 
agreement with other international studies, and highlight the need to include
