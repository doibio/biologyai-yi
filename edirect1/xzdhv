OBJECTIVES: To estimate the burden of disease through 4 complementary procedures 
to years lived with disability (YLDs) using the concept of attributable fraction 
and including analysis of subdomains of disability.
METHODS: We explored the burden on disability for 7 common musculoskeletal 
disorders (CMD) using the 2009 to 2010 Chilean National Health Survey, which 
included the Community Oriented Programme for the Control of Rheumatic Disease 
Core Questionnaire to identify cases with CMD, and an 8-domain questionnaire for 
health state descriptions. We calculated the proportion of disability 
attributable to pain in the general population and people with CMD. We also 
estimated the burden of CMD expressed as YLD and as the proportion of the 
disability in the general population attributable to people with CMD, with a 
particular focus in the pain domain of disability. Second order of uncertainty 
around point estimations was also characterized.
RESULTS: Pain domain of disability accounted for 23.4% of the total disability 
in the general population, and between 20% (fibromyalgia) to 27.1% 
(osteoarthritis of the hip) in people with some of the selected CMD. People with 
chronic musculoskeletal pain accounted for 21.2% of total disability from 
general population, which generated 1.2 million of YLD (6679 YLD/100 000 
inhabitants). Chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee were in the 
top position of specific CMDs, explaining the highest national burden.
CONCLUSION: Pain is an essential component of disability in people with CMD and 
also in the general population. The approach used can be easily applied to other 
health conditions and other domains of disability.

Analysing the molecular regulation mechanism of fat deposition in yellow cattle 
can provide a theoretical basis for the breeding of excellent beef cattle. 
ANGPTL8 (angiopoietin-like protein 8) promotes the formation of lipid droplets 
during adipocyte differentiation. To explore the promoter active region of 
ANGPTL8 and predict potential transcription factors, we further provide a 
theoretical basis for the functional analysis and regulatory mechanism of 
ANGPTL8 in adipogenesis. The promoter region of bovine ANGPTL8 was cloned by 
overlap extension PCR. Online software was used to predict potential 
transcription factor binding sites, and it identified PPARγ, SREBP1, C/EBPα, and 
Znf423 transcription factor binding sites in ANGPTL8 promoter region. A 
luciferase reporter gene vector which contained different deletion fragments of 
the ANGPTL8 promoter was constructed. Then, the vectors were cotransfected into 
293 T cells with the internal control plasmid pRL-TK by cationic liposomes, and 
the relative fluorescence intensity was detected by a microplate reader. The 
results of the luciferase activity analysis showed that the core promoter area 
of ANGPTL8 was in the -885/-227 bp region of the 5' flanking sequence, while 
just two SREBP1 binding sites occurred in this area. When SREBP1 was knocked 
down by siRNA, the expression level of ANGPTL8 was reduced, and we speculated 
that SREBP1 may be an important transcription factor regulating ANGPTL8 
transcription.

Health impacts for New Zealand military personnel from the South African War of 
1899-1902.

AIM: We aimed to update and provide more complete epidemiological information on 
the health impacts of the South African War on New Zealand military personnel.
METHODS: Mortality datasets were identified and analysed. Systematic searches 
were conducted to identify additional war-attributable deaths in the post-war 
period. To estimate the morbidity burden, we analysed a random sample of 
archival military files of 100 military personnel. Lifespan analyses of veterans 
included those by level of combat exposure (eg, a non-combat sample came from a 
troopship that arrived at the time the war ended).
RESULTS: We identified 10 additional war-attributable deaths (and removed three 
non-attributable deaths) to give a new New Zealand total of 239 war-attributable 
deaths. Given the average age of death of 26 years, this equates to the loss of 
10,300 years of life. Most deaths (59%) were from disease rather than directly 
from the conflict (30%). Over a third (39%; 95%CI: 30%-49%) of personnel were 
estimated to have had some form of reported illness (26%) or injury (14%). The 
lifespan analysis of veterans suggested no substantive differences by exposure 
to combat (68.5 [combat] vs 69.1 years [non-combat]) and similarly when compared 
to a matched New Zealand male population.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality burden was larger and the morbidity impacts on the 
New Zealand military personnel in this war were much more substantive than 
revealed in the prior historical literature. There is a need to more fully 
describe historical conflicts so that their adverse health impacts are properly 
understood.

    N Z Med J. 2021 Mar 12;134(1531):8-10.

In this viewpoint, we suggest that policymakers should prioritise health 
interventions by using evidence around health gain, impact on equity, 
health-system costs and cost-effectiveness. We take the example of the new 
cancer control agency in New Zealand, Te Aho o Te Kahu, and argue that its 
decision-making can now be informed by many methodologically compatible 
epidemiological and health economic analyses. These analyses span primary 
prevention of cancer (eg, tobacco control, dietary and physical activity 
interventions and HPV vaccination), cancer screening, cancer treatment and 
palliative care. The largest health gain and cost-savings from the available 
modelling work for New Zealand are seen in nutrition and tobacco control 
interventions in particular. Many of these interventions have potentially 
greater per capita health gain for Māori than non-Māori and are also found to be 
cost saving for the health sector. In summary, appropriate prioritisation of 
interventions can potentially both maximise health benefits as well as making 
best use of government funding of the health system.

Pain is one of the most common causes of seeking medical care. In the day to day 
clinical practice, incidence of pain of some origin is next only to common cold. 
The average life span of an Indian has also increased and this population is 
vulnerable to chronic and cancer pain. Anaesthesiologists are well-versed with 
the art and science of treating pain and their role as pain physician is a 
natural extension of the professional work. 'Pain Medicine' is growing as a 
speciality. Last two decades have seen an explosive growth in the scientific 
study of pain and anaesthesiologists taking up pain medicine as a career. 
Postgraduate students can certainly adopt this super speciality. This article 
highlights the merits and depicts various aspects of 'pain medicine' as a 
career.

BACKGROUND: The treatment for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has become more 
conservative, but still no specific guidelines exist for managing isthmic PTC. 
This study analyzed the outcomes from isthmusectomy in single isthmic PTC and 
compared it with those for patients who previously had undergone a total 
thyroidectomy.
METHODS: An isthmusectomy with prophylactic central compartment neck dissection 
(pCCND) was planned for a single isthmic PTC between 2014 and 2018 
(isthmusectomy group). For cases with gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) or 
multiple nodal metastasis, the procedure was converted to a total thyroidectomy. 
The study analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of the isthmusectomy group. 
Additionally, the results were compared with those of the isthmusectomy-feasible 
group who met the eligibility criteria for isthmusectomy among total 
thyroidectomies performed between 2009 and 2013.
RESULTS: Of the 90 patients in the isthmusectomy group, 81 received 
isthmusectomy and 9 had conversion to a total thyroidectomy. Microcarcinoma 
occurred in 72 cases and gross ETE in 3 cases. One patient showed occult 
satellite cancer, and seven patients showed more than five metastatic nodes. 
Transient hypocalcemia developed in five and patients and permanent hypocalcemia 
in one patient with total thyroidectomy. Of 46 patients who began hormone 
replacement postoperatively, 13 completely stopped taking medication during the 
follow-up period. Metachronous PTC was diagnosed for one patient 12 months after 
isthmusectomy. The isthmusectomy group and the isthmusectomy-feasible group 
showed similar clinicopathologic properties including multifocality, ETE, and 
nodal metastasis. However, the isthmusectomy group showed significantly less 
transient or permanent hypocalcemia and thyroid hormone dependency.
CONCLUSIONS: Isthmusectomy with pCCND may be a feasible alternative for properly 
selected isthmic PTC, resulting in a better quality of life than total 
thyroidectomy.

Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the dr. Bart 
app compared to usual care in people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees and 
hips, applying a health care payer perspective.
METHODS: This economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 6-month randomized 
controlled trial that included 427 participants. The dr. Bart app is a 
stand-alone eHealth application that invites users to select pre-formulated 
goals (i.e., "tiny habits") and triggers for a healthier lifestyle. 
Self-reported outcome measures were health care costs, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) according to the EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) 
descriptive system, the EuroQol visual analog scale (QALY VAS), patient 
activation measure 13 (PAM-13), and 5 subscales of the Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score/Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. 
Missing data were multiply imputed, and bootstrapping was used to estimate 
statistical uncertainty.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of the study participants was 62.1 ± 7.3 years, and 
the majority of participants were female (72%). Health care costs were lower in 
the intervention group compared to the group who received usual care (€-22 [95% 
confidence interval €-36, -3]). For QALY and QALY VAS, the probability of the 
dr. Bart app being cost-effective compared to usual care was 0.71 and 0.67, 
respectively, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of €10,000 and 0.64 and 0.56, 
respectively, at a WTP of €80.000. For self-management behavior, symptoms, pain, 
and activities of daily living, the probability that the dr. Bart app was 
cost-effective was >0.82, and the probability that the dr. Bart app was 
cost-effective in the areas of activities and quality of life was <0.40, 
regardless of WTP thresholds.
CONCLUSION: This economic evaluation showed that costs were lower for the dr. 
Bart app group compared to the group who received usual care. Given the 
noninvasive nature of the intervention and the moderate probability of it being 
cost-effective for the majority of outcomes, the dr. Bart app has the potential 
to serve as a tool to provide education and goal setting in OA and its treatment 
options.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a self-expandable 
covered metallic stent in patients with malignant prostatic obstruction 
secondary to prostate cancer (PC).
METHODS: We reviewed 22 cases of insertion of self-expandable covered metallic 
stents with barbs. Data were collected about PC status. Uroflowmetry variables, 
residual urine volume, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of 
life (QOL), and duration from stent insertion to removal were surveyed. These 
clinical parameters were compared before and after stent insertion.
RESULTS: The patients with PC showed a mean age of 75.5 ± 6.5 years and mean 
5.1 ± 1.9 Charlson comorbidity index. The average flow rate (2.4 ± 1.9 vs 
5.9 ± 2.4 mL/s, P = .005), peak flow rate (6.9 ± 6.2 vs 14.1 ± 5.5 mL/s, 
P = .003), flow time (54.6 ± 29.1 vs 23.6 ± 13.7 s, P = .002), residual urine 
volume (178.7 ± 195.5 vs 7.0 ± 7.1 mL, P = .004), IPSS (26.2 ± 8.1 vs 8.0 ± 6.5 
points, P = .001), and QOL (4.7 ± 1.3 vs 2.4 ± 2.1 points, P = .030) improved 
between before and after stent insertion, respectively. Pain was the most common 
complication, but 60% of the patients were managed without any intervention. 
There were hematuria, urinary retention, urinary frequency, obstruction, and 
urinary incontinence. However, there was no urinary tract infection due to the 
stent. The median time to stent removal was 5.7 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The stent was maintained for about 6 months with improved objective 
and subjective outcomes. The patients with PC, who had a poor comorbidity index 
and advanced PC status showed a tolerable maintenance period. Self-expandable 
covered metallic stents can be used for PC patients with a short life expectancy 
and unsuitability for general anesthesia.

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of henagliflozin in patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicentre phase 3 trial included a 24-week 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, followed by a 28-week 
extension period. Patients with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0% (53 
mmol/mol) to 10.5% (91 mmol/mol) were randomized and treated with once-daily 
placebo (n = 161), henagliflozin 5 mg (n = 162), or henagliflozin 10 mg 
(n = 160). After 24 weeks, patients on placebo were switched to 5 mg or 10 mg 
henagliflozin for the additional 28-week treatment, and patients on 
henagliflozin during 24-week treatment period maintained this initial therapy. 
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24.
RESULTS: At Week 24, the least squares mean HbA1c changes versus placebo from 
baseline were - 0.76% (-8.3 mmol/mol) and - 0.80% (-8.7 mmol/mol) for 
henagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Compared with the 
placebo group, both doses of henagliflozin lowered fasting plasma glucose, 
2-hour postprandial plasma glucose, body weight and blood pressure, and 
increased the proportions of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at 
Week 24. The trends in these improvements were sustained over an additional 
28 weeks. Slightly higher proportions of ketosis and presence of urine ketone 
bodies were observed in patients treated with henagliflozin compared to placebo 
at Week 24. No diabetic ketoacidosis or episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Henagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg as add-on therapy to metformin provided 
a new therapeutic option for the treatment of T2DM patients who have inadequate 
glycaemic control with metformin alone, and was generally well tolerated.

BACKGROUND: Oral semaglutide is the first oral formulation of a glucagon-like 
peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist to be approved in the United States for 
glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While oral 
semaglutide is not indicated for reduction of cardiovascular event risk, its 
label does include evidence of no increase in cardiovascular risk in people who 
received oral semaglutide. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental value of oral 
semaglutide added to existing antihyperglycemic treatment for people with T2DM 
with additional risk for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We estimated the 
lifetime cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide added to current 
antihyperglycemic treatment for T2DM using a microsimulation model based 
primarily on the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model 2 (OM2) 
equations. Oral semaglutide added to current antihyperglycemic treatment was 
separately compared with (a) ongoing background antihyperglycemic treatment, (b) 
sitagliptin, (c) empagliflozin, and (d) liraglutide. Comparators sitagliptin, 
empagliflozin, and liraglutide were added to ongoing antihyperglycemic 
treatment. We applied hazard ratios derived from a network meta-analysis for 
cardiovascular and renal outcomes to the UKPDS OM2 estimated baseline rates. 
Health state utilities and costs were derived from the published literature. We 
estimated total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
clinical events, and cost per major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) avoided, 
over a lifetime time horizon using discount rates of 3% for costs and outcomes. 
RESULTS: The lifetime total cost for people treated with oral semaglutide was 
$311,300, with costs for the other comparators ranging from $262,800 (background 
treatment alone) to $287,800 (liraglutide). Oral semaglutide resulted in the 
fewest MACE, including the fewest cardiovascular deaths. Among the 5 modeled 
treatment strategies, oral semaglutide had the highest LYs gained (8.43 vs. 7.76 
[background treatment alone] to 8.29 [empagliflozin and liraglutide]) and the 
highest QALYs gained (4.11 vs. 3.70 [background treatment alone] to 4.03 
[empagliflozin]). Oral semaglutide would likely be considered cost-effective 
compared with liraglutide (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = 
$40,100), and moderately cost-effective versus background treatment alone 
([ICER] = $117,500/QALY) and sitagliptin (ICER = $145,200/QALY). The ICER for 
oral semaglutide compared with empagliflozin was approximately $458,400 per 
QALY. CONCLUSIONS: As modeled, oral semaglutide as an add-on therapy to 
background antihyperglycemic treatment produced incremental benefits in MACE 
avoided, along with greater QALYs compared with background antihyperglycemic 
treatment alone. Oral semaglutide use resulted in better outcomes than 
background treatment alone or sitagliptin, and similar outcomes to liraglutide 
or empagliflozin with overlapping 95% confidence ranges for QALYs. Oral 
semaglutide was estimated to be cost-effective compared with liraglutide and to 
have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between $100,000 and $150,000 per 
QALY versus sitagliptin and background therapy alone, but it did not meet these 
thresholds compared with empagliflozin. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was

interventions. ICER reports grants from Laura and John Arnold Foundation,

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in modern medicine have translated into increase in 
life expectancy in the USA and with that, a rise in the demand for invasive 
procedures in elderly patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) is the procedure of choice for managing various benign and malignant 
pancreatobiliary conditions and can be associated with various adverse events.
AIM: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate outcomes of 
ERCP in nonagenarians.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, Web 
of Science, and Cochrane Review library until July 2020. Our primary outcomes 
were the rate of technical success and adverse events in nonagenarians. 
Secondary outcomes were comparison of technical success and adverse events 
compared with younger patients.
RESULTS: The initial search revealed 4933 studies, of which 24 studies with 5521 
patients met our inclusion criteria. Pooled technical success rate of ERCP in 
nonagenarians was 92%, and pooled adverse event rate was 7.8%. There was no 
significant difference in technical success rate and overall rate of adverse 
events comparing ERCP outcomes in nonagenarians with a relatively younger 
population. The risk of post-ERCP bleeding was significantly higher in 
nonagenarians compared to younger patients with OR = 1.986 [1.113-3.544], 
I2 = 0. ERCP-related mortality was also significantly higher in nonagenarians 
compared to younger patients with OR = 4.720 [1.368-16.289], I2 = 0.
CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in technical success rate and 
risk of adverse events related to ERCP in nonagenarians compared to younger 
patients. However, the risk of bleeding and procedure-related mortality was 
significantly higher.

Investigation of the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: a contemporary 
synthesis.

The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the main components of 
the stress system. Maintenance of normal physiological events, which include 
stress responses to internal or external stimuli in the body, depends on 
appropriate HPA axis function. In the case of severe cortisol deficiency, 
especially when there is a triggering factor, the patient may develop a 
life-threatening adrenal crisis which may result in death unless early diagnosis 
and adequate treatment are carried out. The maintenance of normal physiology and 
survival depend upon a sufficient level of cortisol in the circulation. 
Life-long glucocorticoid replacement therapy, in most cases meeting but not 
exceeding the need of the patient, is essential for normal life expectancy and 
maintenance of the quality of life. To enable this, the initial step should be 
the correct diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) which requires careful 
evaluation of the HPA axis, a highly dynamic endocrine system. The diagnosis of 
AI in patients with frank manifestations is not challenging. These patients do 
not need dynamic tests, and basal cortisol is usually enough to give a correct 
diagnosis. However, most cases of secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) take 
place in a gray zone when clinical manifestations are mild. In this situation, 
more complicated methods that can simulate the response of the HPA axis to a 
major stress are required. Numerous studies in the assessment of HPA axis have 
been published in the world literature. In this review, the tests used in the 
diagnosis of secondary AI or in the investigation of suspected HPA axis 
insufficiency are discussed in detail, and in the light of this, various 
recommendations are made.

INTRODUCTION: The ALCYONE trial found that daratumumab in combination with 
bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) can significantly improve 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with 
transplant-ineligible, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) in China. In the 
present study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of D-VMP versus VMP for 
patients with newly diagnosed MM in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of frontline 
D-VMP versus VMP for MM. The life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. A series of 
sensitivity analyses was performed to assess the robustness of the model and 
address uncertainties in variable estimates. Subgroup analysis was also 
performed.
RESULTS: D-VMP provided an additional 2.99 LYs and 1.67 QALYs compared with VMP, 
with incremental $64,920 per LY and $116,015 per QALY gained. The results of the 
univariable sensitivity analysis showed that the parameter that had the greatest 
impact on the ICER was the cost of subsequent treatment and daratumumab. When 
the cost of daratumumab was 100%, 70%, 50%, and 30% of the current price, the 
probability of D-VMP being cost-effective was 2.49%, 16.11%, 39.09%, and 70.73% 
at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $30,950/QALY, respectively. The 
results demonstrated that the ICER in all subgroups remained > $30,950/QALY.
CONCLUSION: D-VMP versus VMP is likely to exceed the commonly accepted values of 
cost-effectiveness in patients with transplant-ineligible, newly diagnosed MM in 
China.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to substantial 
morbidity and mortality world-wide. Evidence suggests that ethnic and racial 
minorities have been disproportionately affected in the United States, 
particularly within major population centers. In this study, we evaluated the 
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Cook County, Illinois, and found that the 
rate of years of potential life lost (YPLL) was 4.8 times greater in the most 
affected racial group (YPLL: 2289/100,000 population in Hispanic people) than in 
the least affected group (YPLL: 480/100,000 population in Asian people).

We investigated the impact of peroxyacetic acid (PAA; 200 ppm) spray on the 
microbiota and shelf life of commercial, vacuum-packed beef stored at chiller 
temperatures. Ribeye cuts (n = 147) were collected from a local beef plant on 
the day of production for two consecutive days, with one set collected at the 
start of work with the PAA spray nozzles turned off (control) and during routine 
production with the PAA spray nozzles turned on (PAA) each day. Packs were 
stored at 4, 2, and -1°C for up to 34, 104, and 180 days and sampled at 
appropriate intervals for sensory assessment, microbial enumeration, and 
microbial profiling by 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis. Treatment with PAA did 
not affect the initial meat pH, the initial numbers of total aerobes, lactic 
acid bacteria, or Enterobacteriaceae (P > 0.05) before storage; however, it 
delayed the onset of spoilage by 7, 21, and 54 days at 4, 2, and -1°C, 
respectively. Square-root models of the variation of growth rate with 
temperature indicated lactic acid bacteria grew faster and Enterobacteriaceae 
grew slower on PAA-treated than on untreated meat. Negative associations between 
pH and deterioration of meat during storage were observed for PAA-treated meat. 
During storage, the microbiota were primarily dominated by Carnobacterium and 
Lactobacillus/Lactococcus on control meat but by Leuconostoc on PAA-treated 
meat. Serratia, Yersinia, and Clostridium were identified by linear discriminant 
effect size analysis as biomarkers for control meat; Clostridium was found in 
high abundance in samples that had the highest spoilage scores.IMPORTANCE The 
findings of this study show that PAA solutions applied at low concentrations 
under commercial settings positively modulated the meat microbiota. It did not 
have bactericidal effects for beef subprimals with very low microbial loads. 
However, it differentially impacted the members of the microbiota, which 
resulted in delayed onset of spoilage of vacuum-packed beef subprimal stored at 
all three temperatures (4, 2, and -1°C). This differential impact could be 
through one or a combination of the following factors: favoring the growth of 
lactic acid bacteria, which may in turn exert a competitive exclusion that might 
be due to production of antimicrobial compounds such as organic acids and 
bacteriocins; exerting synergistic antimicrobial effects with low temperatures 
against members of Enterobacteriaceae; and direct or indirect inhibitory effects 
against members of the clostridia. These findings not only advance our 
understanding of the microbial ecology of vacuum-packed meat stored at chiller 
temperatures but also suggest that bacteriostatic concentrations of 
antimicrobial interventions can be explored for shelf-life extension.

OBJECTIVES: Some researchers have observed an increased number of deaths during 
the follow-up of young patients who undergo aortic valve replacement due to 
severe aortic stenosis, suggesting that this procedure does not restore their 
life expectancy. Our goal was to confirm these findings and explore sex-based 
differences.
METHODS: All patients between 50 and 65 years of age who underwent isolated 
aortic valve replacement in 27 Spanish centres during an 18-year period were 
included. We compared observed and expected survival at 15 years of follow-up 
and estimated the cumulative incidence of death from a competing risks point of 
view. We stratified by sex and analysed if being a woman was an independent risk 
factor for death.
RESULTS: For men, the observed survival at 10 and 15 years of follow-up was 85% 
[95% confidence interval (CI) 83.6%-86.4%] and 72.3% (95% CI 69.7%-74.7%), 
respectively whereas the expected survival was 88.1% and 78.8%. For women, the 
observed survival at 10 and 15 years was 85% (95% CI 82.8%-86.9%) and 73% (95% 
CI 69.1%-76.4%), whereas the expected survival was 94.6% and 89.4%. At 15 years 
of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of death due to the disease in men and 
women was 8.2% and 16.7%, respectively. In addition, being a woman was an 
independent risk factor for death (hazard ratio = 1.23 (95% CI 1.02-1.48; 
P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: After the aortic valve replacement, men and women do not have their 
life expectancy restored, but this loss is much higher in women than in men. In 
addition, being a woman is a risk factor for long-term death. Reasons for these 
findings are unknown and must be investigated.

BACKGROUND Dialister pneumosintes is a suspected periodontal pathogen. It can 
affect different parts of the body either by hematogenous transmission or 
regional spread. Here, we report a case of 30-year-old previously healthy woman 
diagnosed with mediastinal and neck abscess caused by this pathogen. CASE REPORT 
A 30-year-old woman presented with a 1-day history of fever, vomiting, and 
diarrhea. She was on her last dose of a 2-week course of oral antibiotic for 
suspected dental abscess. On admission, parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic was 
started for sepsis of unknown source. Because of intermittent spike of high 
temperature despite being on an antibiotic, cross-sectional imaging was 
performed, which revealed a superior mediastinal abscess with extension in the 
neck. She was referred to the ENT surgeon for incision and drainage of the 
collection. However, the procedure was complicated by injury to the right 
internal jugular vein. Her postoperative period was also convoluted with the 
development of pulmonary embolism, followed by deep vein thrombosis of the right 
upper limb. Her pus polymerase chain reaction test detected 16s rRNA gene, 
suggestive of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, and anaerobic blood culture grew 
Dialister pneumosintes. After a prolonged course of illness and antibiotic 
treatment, she recovered well, and now is back to her normal activities. 
CONCLUSIONS Potential life-threatening complications may develop from 
periodontal infection by this microorganism. In patients being treated for 
sepsis of unknown origin, not responding to antibiotic treatment, and with a 
history of recent periodontal infection, a deep-seated abscess needs to be 
considered.

CONTEXT: Medication deprescribing in palliative care settings has been 
insufficiently studied.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of a deprescribing program in hospice 
patients with limited life expectancy.
DESIGN: Pharmacist-led, single arm, single-centered, retrospective analysis of a 
pilot deprescribing program in an integrated healthcare delivery organization 
between 9/1/2018 to 1/31/2019.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who 
achieved ≥50% reduction of the recommended medications to deprescribe.
RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included in the analysis. The average age 
was 77.5 ± 23.7 years, with 53.6% being women and 54.6% white. The most common 
primary diagnosis was cancer (58.8%), with cardiovascular disease the next most 
common (15.5%). The mean number of baseline comorbidities was 2.0 ± 1.6. Of 698 
prescriptions at the start of hospice enrollment, 79.4% of patients achieved 
a ≥50% reduction in medications recommended for deprescribing. This success was 
seen mostly in cardiovascular and other nonspecific medications. We found that 
every 1-unit increase in the number of patient encounters with hospice 
pharmacists was associated with a 3.2-fold higher odds of achieving a ≥50% 
reduction in medications that were recommended for deprescribing.
CONCLUSION: The findings from this pilot study revealed that a collaborative, 
pharmacist-led, collaborative medication deprescribing program initiative was 
associated with a 79% success in ≥50% medication reduction. More frequent 
patient encounters had higher odds of success. Future studies, utilizing a 
control group, should focus on determining the effectiveness of the program and 
the impact on quality of life.

The aging process in OECD countries calls for a better understanding of the 
future disease prevalence, life expectancy (LE) and patterns of inequalities in 
health outcomes. In this paper we present the results obtained from several 
dynamic microsimulation models of the Future Elderly Model family for 12 OECD 
countries, with the aim of reproducing for the first time comparable long-term 
projections in individual health status across OECD countries. We provide 
projections of LE and prevalence of major chronic conditions and disabilities, 
overall, by gender and by education. We find that the prevalence of main chronic 
conditions in Europe is catching-up with the United States and significant 
heterogeneity in the evolution of gender and educational gradients. Our findings 
represent a contribution to support policymakers in designing and implementing 
effective interventions in the healthcare sector.
