with probabilities of being cost-saving of 84% for the school education 
programme, 89% for the mass media campaign and 99% for the low sodium salt 
substitute. Results were largely robust in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: All the salt reduction strategies evaluated were highly 
cost-effective with very high probabilities of being cost-saving. Salt reduction 
in Cameroon has the potential to save many lives and offers good value for 
money.

Drug-induced hematological disorders constitute up to 30% of all blood 
dyscrasias seen in the clinic. Hematologic toxicity from drugs may range from 
life-threatening marrow aplasia, agranulocytosis, hemolysis, thrombosis to mild 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these 
disorders vary from an extension of the pharmacological effect of the drug to 
idiosyncratic and immune-mediated reactions. Predicting these reactions is often 
difficult, and this makes clinical decision-making challenging. Evidence 
supporting the role of pharmacogenomics in the management of these disorders in 
clinical practice is rapidly evolving. Despite the Clinical Pharmacology 
Implementation Consortium and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base recommendations, 
few tests have been incorporated into routine practice. This review aims to 
provide a comprehensive summary of the various drugs which are implicated for 
the hematological adverse events, their underlying mechanisms, and the current 
evidence and practical recommendations to incorporate pharmacogenomic testing in 
clinical care for predicting these disorders.

Michigan Medical School; and Health Management and Policy, University of 
Michigan School of Public Health.

BACKGROUND: This study performs an economic analysis of volar locking plate, 
external fixation, percutaneous pinning, or casting in elderly patients with 
closed distal radius fractures.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical 
Trial, a randomized, multicenter, international clinical trial with a parallel 
nonoperative casted group of patients older than 60 years with surgically 
indicated, extraarticular closed distal radius fractures. Thirty-Six-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey-converted utilities and total costs from Medicare were 
used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio.
RESULTS: Casted patients were self-selected and older (p < 0.001) than the 
randomized surgical cohorts, but otherwise similar in sociodemographic 
characteristics. Quality-adjusted life-years for percutaneous pinning were 
highest at 9.17 and external fixation lowest at 8.81. Total costs expended were 
$16,354 for volar locking plates, $16,012 for external fixation, $11,329 for 
percutaneous pinning, and $6837 for casting. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios for volar locking plates and external fixation were dominated by 
percutaneous pinning and casting. The ratio for percutaneous pinning compared to 
casting was $28,717. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a 10, 5, 53, 
and 32 percent chance of volar locking plate, external fixation, percutaneous 
pinning, and casting, respectively, being cost-effective at the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: Casting is the most cost-effective treatment modality in the 
elderly with closed extraarticular distal radius fractures and should be 
considered before surgery. In unstable closed fractures, percutaneous pinning, 
which is the most cost-effective surgical intervention, may be considered before 
volar locking plates or external fixation.

INTRODUCTION: Safety and efficacy results of the phase 1 study and phase 1/2 
extension study of the bispecific antibody emicizumab in patients with severe 
haemophilia A with or without factor VIII inhibitors for up to 2.8 years were 
reported previously.
AIM: To evaluate further longer-term data including patients' perceptions at 
study completion.
METHODS: Emicizumab was administered subcutaneously once weekly at maintenance 
doses of 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg with potential up-titration. All patients were later 
switched to the approved maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients received emicizumab for up to 5.8 years. Most adverse 
events were mild and unrelated to emicizumab. Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) 
for bleeds treated with coagulation factors decreased from pre-emicizumab rates 
or remained zero in all patients. The median ABRs were low at 1.25, 0.83 and 
0.22 during the 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg dosing periods, respectively. Of 8 patients 
who decreased their doses from 3 to 1.5 mg/kg, ABRs decreased in 4, remained at 
zero in 2, and increased in 2. Total time spent with symptoms associated with 
treated bleeds decreased in all patients except 2. All patients answered 
'improved' for bleeding severity and time until bleeding stops, except 1 
answering 'slightly improved'. Most patients answered 'improved' or 'slightly 
improved'' for daily life and feelings; in particular, all patients except 1 
answered 'improved' or 'slightly improved' for anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term emicizumab prophylaxis for up to 5.8 years was safe and 
efficacious, and may improve patients' daily lives and feelings, regardless of 
inhibitor status.

AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential addition of empagliflozin 
versus sitagliptin after metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with 
or without cardiovascular disease (CVD) from the perspective of the US 
healthcare payer.
METHODS: An individual simulation model predicted lifetime diabetes-related 
complications, using UKPDS-OM2 equations in patients without CVD, and EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME equations in patients with CVD. Additional US-based sources informed 
inputs for population characteristics, adverse events, non-CV death, treatment 
escalation, quality of life and costs. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were discounted 3.0% annually.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for second-line 
empagliflozin versus sitagliptin in the overall T2D population was $6967/QALY. 
Empagliflozin led to longer CVD-free survival (0.07 years) and an 11% reduction 
in CV death in patients with CVD compared with sitagliptin. Empagliflozin 
resulted in greater benefits with greater costs in patients with versus without 
baseline CVD, yielding ICERs of $3589/QALY versus $12 577/QALY, respectively. 
Results were consistent across a range of deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses and scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Compared with sitagliptin, empagliflozin was cost-effective (at 
$50 000/QALY US threshold) as a second-line treatment to metformin for T2D 
patients with or without CVD in the United States. Our findings lend additional 
support for more widespread adoption of guidelines by healthcare decision-makers 
for T2D treatment.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes-related foot ulcers give rise to considerable morbidity, 
generate a high monetary cost for health and social care services and precede 
the majority of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. There are many 
clinical prediction rules in existence to assess risk of foot ulceration but few 
have been subject to validation.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to produce an evidence-based clinical pathway 
for risk assessment and management of the foot in people with diabetes mellitus 
to estimate cost-effective monitoring intervals and to perform 
cost-effectiveness analyses and a value-of-information analysis.
DESIGN: We developed and validated a prognostic model using predictive 
modelling, calibration and discrimination techniques. An overview of systematic 
reviews already completed was followed by a review of randomised controlled 
trials of interventions to prevent foot ulceration in diabetes mellitus. A 
review of the health economic literature was followed by the construction of an 
economic model, an analysis of the transitional probability of moving from one 
foot risk state to another, an assessment of cost-effectiveness and a 
value-of-information analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: The effects of simple and complex interventions and different 
monitoring intervals for the clinical prediction rules were evaluated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome was the incidence of foot ulceration. We 
compared the new clinical prediction rules in conjunction with the most 
effective preventative interventions at different monitoring intervals with a 
'treat-all' strategy.
DATA SOURCES: Data from an electronic health record for 26,154 people with 
diabetes mellitus in one Scottish health board were used to estimate the 
monitoring interval. The Prediction Of Diabetic foot UlcerationS (PODUS) data 
set was used to develop and validate the clinical prediction rule.
REVIEW METHODS: We searched for eligible randomised controlled trials of 
interventions using search strategies created for Ovid® (Wolters Kluwer, Alphen 
aan den Rijn, the Netherlands), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials. Randomised controlled trials in progress were 
identified via the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number 
Registry and systematic reviews were identified via PROSPERO. Databases were 
searched from inception to February 2019.
RESULTS: The clinical prediction rule was found to accurately assess the risk of 
foot ulceration. Digital infrared thermometry, complex interventions and 
therapeutic footwear with offloading devices were found to be effective in 
preventing foot ulcers. The risk of developing a foot ulcer did not change over 
time for most people. We found that interventions to prevent foot ulceration may 
be cost-effective but there is uncertainty about this. Digital infrared 
thermometry and therapeutic footwear with offloading devices may be 
cost-effective when used to treat all people with diabetes mellitus regardless 
of their ulcer risk.
LIMITATIONS: The threats to the validity of the results in some randomised 
controlled trials in the review and the large number of missing data in the 
electronic health record mean that there is uncertainty in our estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that interventions to prevent foot ulceration are 
effective but it is not clear who would benefit most from receiving the 
interventions. The ulceration risk does not change over an 8-year period for 
most people with diabetes mellitus. A change in the monitoring interval from 
annually to every 2 years for those at low risk would be acceptable.
FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS: Improving the completeness of electronic health 
records and sharing data would help improve our knowledge about the most 
clinically effective and cost-effective approaches to prevent foot ulceration in 
diabetes mellitus.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42016052324.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in

website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: People with diabetes sometimes have problems with their 
feet that can become serious and make getting around harder and life less 
enjoyable. We have developed a test based on a simple score to find out a 
person’s risk of getting a foot ulcer. We also wanted to know how often the test 
needs to be done. People who have been tested and learn that they might go on to 
have foot problems rightly expect to be given treatment that stops the problem 
happening in the first place. In this project, we read many written reports 
about the best treatments to prevent foot ulcers. We found that some things can 
prevent foot ulcers, such as wearing special shoes and insoles, taking the 
temperature of the skin of the foot and resting when the temperature rises, and 
receiving specialist care from diabetes foot care teams. However, we also looked 
at the costs of the test and treatments and found that some treatments are 
better value for money than others. By using people’s health data from NHS 
computers, we discovered that very few people with diabetes develop a worse risk 
score for foot ulcers as time goes on, and it seems that being tested every year 
is not necessary for everyone. New clinical trials might help to improve foot 
health for people with diabetes, but if all of the researchers who have 
collected data from people in clinical trials shared their data it would be 
possible to find out more about who will gain most from these treatments without 
spending a lot on new research. It is clear that better input of patients’ 
health data into NHS computers will benefit diabetes research in the future.

How to manage CML patients with comorbidities.

Cortes J(1).

Author information:
(1)Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) often have comorbidities, at an 
incidence that might be higher than in the general population. Because of the 
favorable outcome of most patients with CML treated with tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), a greater number of comorbidities might be the most 
significant adverse feature for long-term survival. The presence of 
comorbidities may also affect the risk of developing adverse events with TKIs. 
This effect is perhaps best exemplified by the risk of developing 
arterio-occlusive events, which is greatest for patients who have other risk 
factors for such events, with the risk increasing with higher numbers of 
comorbidities. The coexistence of comorbidities in patients with CML not only 
may affect TKI selection but also demands close monitoring of the overall health 
condition of the patient to optimize safety and provide the opportunity for an 
optimal outcome to such patients. With optimal, holistic management of leukemia 
and all other conditions afflicting them, patients with CML and comorbidities 
may aim for a near-normal life expectancy, just as the more select patients 
enrolled in clinical trials now enjoy.

OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a common, chronic neurological disorder that 
disproportionately affects individuals living in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs), where the treatment gap remains high and adherence to 
medication remains low. Community health workers (CHWs) have been shown to be 
effective at improving adherence to chronic medications, yet no study assessing 
the costs of CHWs in epilepsy management has been reported.
METHODS: Using a Markov model with age- and sex-varying transition 
probabilities, we determined whether deploying CHWs to improve epilepsy 
treatment adherence in rural South Africa would be cost-effective. Data were 
derived using published studies from rural South Africa. Official statistics and 
international disability weights provided cost and health state values, 
respectively, and health gains were measured using quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: The intervention was estimated at International Dollars ($) 123 250 per 
annum per sub-district community and cost $1494 and $1857 per QALY gained for 
males and females, respectively. Assuming a costlier intervention and lower 
effectiveness, cost per QALY was still less than South Africa's Gross Domestic 
Product per capita of $13 215, the cost-effectiveness threshold applied.
SIGNIFICANCE: CHWs would be cost-effective and the intervention dominated even 
when costs and effects of the intervention were unfavorably varied. Health 
system re-engineering currently underway in South Africa identifies CHWs as 
vital links in primary health care, thereby ensuring sustainability of the 
intervention. Further research on understanding local health state utility 
values and cost-effectiveness thresholds could further inform the current model, 
and undertaking the proposed intervention would provide better estimates of its 
efficacy on reducing the epilepsy treatment gap in rural South Africa.

This study aimed to illustrate the impact of injury-related deaths on life 
expectancy in China in 2016 and to identify the high-risk population. Standard 
life tables were used to calculate life expectancy and cause-eliminated life 
expectancy by utilizing mortality data from the national mortality surveillance 
system. In 2016, the life expectancy of Chinese residents was 78.91 years. After 
eliminating injury-related mortality, the life expectancy of the residents 
increased by 1.13 years, which was higher in male and rural residents compared 
with female and urban residents. The life expectancy on the Eastern and Central 
regions increased slowly compared with the Western region. The greatest 
influencing factor on life expectancy was road traffic injuries, followed by 
falls. Falls had a greater impact on life expectancy for children under 5 years 
old and those aged over 65 years. This study indicates that deaths caused by 
injury had a noteworthy impact on life expectancy in China. More attention 
should be paid to road traffic injuries, and effective preventive measures 
should be taken to reduce deaths related to injury to increase the life 
expectancy of residents, especially in children under 5 years and adults over 65 
years. By reducing the deaths caused by injury, the life expectancy level is 
likely to further improve.

BACKGROUND: Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) or biliary 
papillomatosis is a precursor lesion of papillary cholangiocarcinoma.1 IPNB is 
recognized as a biliary counterpart of IPMN (pancreatic intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm). IPNB is a rare disease involving entire (diffuse type) or 
one part (localized type) of biliary tree. Patients without distant metastasis 
are considered for surgical resection. For patients with distal bile duct 
papillomatosis, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is recommended for patients with 
invasive distal bile duct IPNB. PD is a high complex procedure associated with 
the deterioration of endocrine and exocrine functions leading to a significant 
impact on quality of life.2 Some authors have reported a new surgical approach 
leading to a complete resection of the common bile duct without pancreatectomy.3 
METHODS: We report the case of a 71-year-old female presented to our department 
with jaundice. At endoscopic ultrasound with cholangioscopy and CT scan, 2-cm 
distal bile duct mass tumor with villous component was seen. All needle biopsies 
were benign, and no distant disease was found. According to the risk of 
degeneration of this tumor, a surgical resection was decided.
RESULTS: Intraoperative frozen section assessed the benignity of peripancreatic 
lymph nodes. We performed surgical ampullectomy with resection of the common 
bile duct. The intrapancreatic common bile duct was completely mobilized between 
the ampullectomy area and the upper edge of the pancreas. Frozen sections on 
distal and proximal margins of common bile duct were performed to discard 
malignancy. Finally, reconstruction consisted on the main pancreatic duct 
reimplantation to the duodenum and choledochoduodenostomy. The histological 
analysis confirmed the diagnosis of biliary papillomatosis with low-grade 
dysplasia.
CONCLUSION: This procedure allows complete resection of benign tumors with 
endobiliary extension and preserve intestinal continuity and 
pancreatic parenchyma.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of overall patient health are essential to inform 
treatment decisions for patients diagnosed with cancer. The authors applied XWAS 
methods, herein referred to as "laboratory-wide association study (LWAS)", to 
evaluate associations between routinely collected laboratory tests and survival 
in veterans with prostate cancer.
METHODS: The authors identified 133,878 patients who were diagnosed with 
prostate cancer between 2000 and 2013 in the Veterans Health Administration 
using any laboratory tests collected within 6 months of diagnosis (3,345,083 
results). Using the LWAS framework, the false-discovery rate was used to test 
the association between multiple laboratory tests and survival, and these 
results were validated using training, testing, and validation cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 31 laboratory tests associated with survival met stringent 
LWAS criteria. LWAS confirmed markers of prostate cancer biology 
(prostate-specific antigen: hazard ratio [HR], 1.07 [95% confidence interval 
(95% CI), 1.06-1.08]; and alkaline phosphatase: HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.20-1.24]) as 
well laboratory tests of general health (eg, serum albumin: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 
0.76-0.80]; and creatinine: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.03-1.07]) and inflammation 
(leukocyte count: HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.98-1.26]; and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate: HR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.09-1.61]). In addition, the authors derived and 
validated separate models for patients with localized and advanced disease, 
identifying 28 laboratory markers and 15 laboratory markers, respectively, in 
each cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors identified routinely collected laboratory data 
associated with survival for patients with prostate cancer using LWAS 
methodologies, including markers of prostate cancer biology, overall health, and 
inflammation. Broadening consideration of determinants of survival beyond those 
related to cancer itself could help to inform the design of clinical trials and 
aid in shared decision making.
LAY SUMMARY: This article examined routine laboratory tests associated with 
survival among veterans with prostate cancer. Using laboratory-wide association 
studies, the authors identified 31 laboratory tests associated with survival 
that can be used to inform the design of clinical trials and aid patients in 
shared decision making.

The appropriate use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in elderly patients with 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is largely debated. Due to the "demographic 
transition" in western countries, the elderly represent a growing percentage of 
patients admitted to hospitals for ACS, and among this high risk setting 
population most of early and late adverse outcomes occur. The presence of 
several concomitant "comorbidities" complicate the management strategy of both 
medical or invasive treatment and the clinical decision making process is 
challenging. Moreover, elderly people are constantly underrepresented in 
clinical trials and studies. As a result, there is no specific evidence about 
the optimal antithrombotic therapy in elderly and no specific recommendations 
are mentioned in the current ACS guidelines. Currently, the best practice for 
old people is still rudimentary and principally extrapolated from general 
cardiovascular guidelines. The management of elderly patients should be based on 
the evaluation of ischemic and hemorrhagic risk, life expectancy, comorbidities 
and parameters that are not included in the scores recommended by the current 
guidelines such as frailty and disability. In the era of "precision medicine", 
the evaluation of bleeding and ischaemic risk in elderly patients must be a 
dynamic process because of the risk changing over time. A"tailored therapy by 
individualized medicine" is the key of management strategy.

BACKGROUND: With the global population aging and life expectancy increasing, 
dementia has turned a priority in the health care system. In Chile, dementia is 
one of the most important causes of disability in the elderly and the most 
rapidly growing cause of death in the last 20 years. Cognitive complaint is 
considered a predictor for cognitive and functional decline, incident mild 
cognitive impairment, and incident dementia. The GERO cohort is the Chilean core 
clinical project of the Geroscience Center for Brain Health and Metabolism 
(GERO). The objective of the GERO cohort is to analyze the rate of functional 
decline and progression to clinical dementia and their associated risk factors 
in a community-dwelling elderly with subjective cognitive complaint, through a 
population-based study. We also aim to undertake clinical research on brain 
ageing and dementia disorders, to create data and biobanks with the appropriate 
infrastructure to conduct other studies and facilitate to the national and 
international scientific community access to the data and samples for research.
METHODS: The GERO cohort aims the recruitment of 300 elderly subjects 
(> 70 years) from Santiago (Chile), following them up for at least 3 years. 
Eligible people are adults not diagnosed with dementia with subjective cognitive 
complaint, which are reported either by the participant, a proxy or both. 
Participants are identified through a household census. The protocol for 
evaluation is based on a multidimensional approach including socio-demographic, 
biomedical, psychosocial, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric and motor 
assessments. Neuroimaging, blood and stool samples are also obtained. This 
multidimensional evaluation is carried out in a baseline and 2 follow-ups 
assessments, at 18 and 36 months. In addition, in months 6, 12, 24, and 30, a 
telephone interview is performed in order to keep contact with the participants 
and to assess general well-being.
DISCUSSION: Our work will allow us to determine multidimensional risks factors 
associated with functional decline and conversion to dementia in elderly with 
subjective cognitive complain. The aim of our GERO group is to establish the 
capacity to foster cutting edge and multidisciplinary research on aging in Chile 
including basic and clinical research.

BACKGROUND: The Ministry of Health has reported that in Japan, the Shiga 
prefecture has the highest life expectancy. Subjective health perception is a 
predictive indicator of mortality. For this study, we examined the association 
between subjective health perception and multiple lifestyle factors.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2015 Health and Nutrition Survey in Shiga 
prefecture. The analytic sample comprised 6057 adults aged 20 or older. 
Information on subjective health perception and lifestyle behaviors was obtained 
from a self-administered questionnaire. As for subjective health perception, 
participants were divided into 2 groups: (1) Excellent or Good and (2) Average, 
Poor, or Very Poor. A 1-day dietary survey was also administered. The health 
behaviors score (HBS) was calculated based on 5 factors: consuming a healthy 
diet, never smoking, low-risk alcohol drinking, regular exercise, and moderate 
sleep duration. HBS scores ranged from 0 to 5. Multiple logistic regression was 
used to calculate the sex-, age- BMI- and energy intake-adjusted odds ratios 
(ORs) of poor subjective health across HBS, with 0 points as the reference.
RESULTS: Among all participants, 2397 (39.6%) individuals were classified into 
the good subjective health group. Participants with an HBS of 3 (OR 0.59, 95% CI 
0.37-0.96), 4 (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.65) or 5 (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.59) had a 
lower OR of rating themselves as being average/poor health compared with those 
having zero. The association with a higher HBS was remarkable (p for trend: 
< 0.001). Additional analyses revealed that the combinations including regular 
exercise were particularly associated with a lower risk of subjective 
average/poor health.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the higher the number of healthy lifestyle 
factors, the lower risk of subjective average/poor health. Combinations of 
healthy lifestyle factors, especially those involving exercise, suggest good 
subjective health for individuals living in the Shiga prefecture.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy at birth in Israel is steadily increasing. This 
raises the question whether Israelis are becoming healthier. The purpose of this 
study is to estimate trends in morbidity and to try to explain what causes 
morbidity levels to change.
METHODS: We used 17 years of repeated cross-sectional data from the Social 
Survey to estimate trends in self-rated health. We used regression models to 
explain the trends in self-rated health that were observed from 2002 to 2018.
RESULTS: Four major findings emerged. First, morbidity as measured by self-rated 
health has declined. Second, gains in educational attainment do not explain the 
decline in morbidity. Third, the rise in national expenditure on health per 
capita is strongly correlated with the decline in morbidity. And fourth, the 
effect of the national expenditure on health per capita appears to be stronger 
among women and among those without an academic degree.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated health has improved. However, it has not improved to the 
same extent for all Israelis. The results of this study show that the health of 
women has improved more than that of men and that the health of non-academics 
has improved more than that of academics. The latter suggests that the 
progressive effect of public financing has offset the regressive effect of 
out-of-pocket payments on self-rated health.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 10-15% of women, is costly and 
debilitating, yet often remains undiagnosed. Within Alberta, Canada, screening 
is conducted at public health well child clinics using the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale. If screened high-risk, women are offered referral to their 
family physicians for follow up diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: We developed a decision tree to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PPD 
screening versus not screening in Alberta over a two-year time horizon using a 
public healthcare payer perspective. Both the current practice (51% attending 
referral) and a scenario analysis (100% attending referral) are presented.
RESULTS: Current practice results suggest screening leads to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,644 USD per quality adjusted life year 
(QALY). At a population-level, this resulted in an annual 813 (11%) additional 
cases diagnosed, 120 additional QALYs gained, and an additional cost of $2.1 
million relative to not screening. With 100% attending referral, the ICER fell 
to $13,908 per QALY, resulting in an annual 1997 (27%) additional cases 
diagnosed, 249 additional QALYs gained, and an additional cost of $3.5 million 
relative to not screening.
LIMITATIONS: We were unable to explore the cost-effectiveness of PPD screening 
versus not screening for secondary populations, including children.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest screening may be most valuable when 
participation and compliance are maximized, where all women screened high-risk 
attend referral. This leads to greater value for money and increased maternal 
health gains across the population. Collaboration among public health and 
primary care services is encouraged to improve outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of antiviral treatment in adult 
immune-tolerant (IT) phase chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients is uncertain.
DESIGN: We designed a Markov model to compare expected costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of starting antiviral treatment at IT-phase 
('treat-IT') vs delaying the therapy until active hepatitis phase ('untreat-IT') 
in CHB patients over a 20-year horizon. A cohort of 10 000 non-cirrhotic 
35-year-old patients in IT-phase CHB (hepatitis B e antigen-positive, mean serum 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels 7.6 log10 IU/mL, and normal alanine 
aminotransferase levels) was simulated. Input parameters were obtained from 
previous studies at Asan Medical Center, Korea. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the treat-IT and untreat-IT strategies 
was calculated.
RESULTS: From a healthcare system perspective, the treat-IT strategy with 
entecavir or tenofovir had an ICER of US$16 516/QALY, with an annual 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence of 0.73% in the untreat-IT group. With 
the annual HCC risk ≥0.54%, the treat-IT strategy was cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of US$20 000/QALY. From a societal perspective 
considering productivity loss by premature death, the treat-IT strategy was 
extremely cost-effective, and was dominant (ICER <0) if the HCC risk was ≥0.43%, 
suggesting that the treat-IT strategy incurs less costs than the untreat-IT 
strategy. The most influential parameters on cost-effectiveness of the treat-IT
