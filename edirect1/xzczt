the 3'-untranslated regions of vitamin B-related genes, including TCN2 (encodes 
transcobalamin II), CD320 (encodes transcobalamin II receptor), SLC19A1 (encodes 
reduced folate carrier protein 1), and SLC19A2 (encodes thiamine carrier 1), 
with osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). We 
recruited 301 postmenopausal women and performed genotyping of CD320 
rs9426C>T,TCN2 rs10418C>T, SLC19A1 rs1051296G>T, and SLC19A2 rs16862199C>T using 
a polymerization chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. 
There was a significantly higher incidence of both osteoporosis (AOR 5.019; 95% 
CI, 1.533-16.430, p < 0.05) and OVCF (AOR, 5.760; 95% CI, 1.480-22.417, p < 
0.05) in individuals with genotype CD320 CT+TT and high homocysteine 
concentrations. Allele combination analysis revealed that two combinations, 
namely CD320 C-TCN2 T-SLC19A1 T-SLC19A2 C (OR, 3.244; 95% CI, 1.478-7.120, p < 
0.05) and CD320 T-TCN2 C-SLC19A1 G-SLC19A2 C (OR, 2.287; 95% CI, 1.094-4.782, p 
< 0.05), were significantly more frequent among the osteoporosis group. Our 
findings suggest that SNPs within the CD320 gene in 3´-UTR may contribute to 
osteoporosis and OVCF occurrences in some individuals. Furthermore, specific 
allele combinations of CD320, TCN2, SLC19A1, and SLC19A2 may contribute to 
increased susceptibility to osteoporosis and OVCF.

Sarcopenia has been defined as a progressive decline of skeletal muscle mass, 
strength, and functions in elderly people. It is accompanied by physical 
frailty, functional disability, falls, hospitalization, and mortality, and is 
becoming a major geriatric disorder owing to the increasing life expectancy and 
growing older population worldwide. Experimental models are critical to 
understand the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and develop therapeutic strategies. 
Although its etiologies remain to be further elucidated, several mechanisms of 
sarcopenia have been identified, including cellular senescence, proteostasis 
imbalance, oxidative stress, and "inflammaging." In this article, we address 
three main aspects. First, we describe the fundamental aging mechanisms. Next, 
we discuss both in vitro and in vivo experimental models based on molecular 
mechanisms that have the potential to elucidate the biochemical processes 
integral to sarcopenia. The use of appropriate models to reflect sarcopenia 
and/or its underlying pathways will enable researchers to understand sarcopenia 
and develop novel therapeutic strategies for sarcopenia. Lastly, we discuss the 
possible molecular targets and the current status of drug candidates for 
sarcopenia treatment. In conclusion, the development of experimental models for 
sarcopenia is essential to discover molecular targets that are valuable as 
biochemical biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for sarcopenia.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequences starting with 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), afatinib and osimertinib, for the treatment of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive (Exon 19 deletion or 
L858R) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stages IIIB - IV in Colombia.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was designed, using information from 
global and progression-free survival curves. For first and second-generation 
TKI, second line treatment was assumed according to the presence of T790M 
mutation to define the use of osimertinib or chemotherapy. The cost of the 
states without progression and post-progression was estimated using the base 
case approach, identified through consultation with clinical experts.
RESULTS: The cost of treatment starting with afatinib in the first line was of 
222,247 USD (1 USD = 3171.99 COP) and produced 1.36 QALYs. The strategy with 
afatinib was dominant with respect to that of first line TKI (227,289 USD and 
1.34 QALY). The strategy with osimertinib resulted in more QALYs and higher 
costs, with ICERs of 35,062 USD, exceeding the current willingness to pay 
threshold for Colombia.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment starting with afatinib in the first line is dominant with 
respect to the strategy with first line TKI. The ICER of osimertinib sequence 
exceeds the threshold when compared with afatinib one.

During the last three decades, Japan has become one of the world's top countries 
for longevity, and the increase in average life expectancy is accompanied by a 
sharp rise in older population 65 years of age and above to ∼28%. This study 
aimed to examine the changes in major health-related measures, including a 
physical constitution, physical function, and functional capacity of 
community-dwelling Japanese older people in the last decade. From the data of 13 
longitudinal cohort studies on aging conducted in Japan with a total of 13,441 
older subjects, this study analyzed the changes in six indices that are related 
to health and functioning of the older people; height, weight, body mass index, 
walking speed, grip strength, and instrumental activity of daily living, between 
2007 (±2 years) and 2017 (±2 years). Comparison of data for the two periods 
between subjects matched for age group and gender evidently showed better health 
status and a slower decline in most of the health-related measures in 2017 
compared to a decade ago. The results of this study indicate that the phenomenon 
of "rejuvenation" is occurring among the new generation of Japanese older 
adults, and the importance of this older population as a social resource in the 
super-aged society should be reacknowledged.

PURPOSE: To explore the trend patterns and gender disparity in global burden of 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by year, age, and socioeconomic status 
using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study 2017.
METHODS: DALYs and impairment data caused by AMD were extracted from GBD Study 
2017. World Bank income level (WBIL) and human development index (HDI) in 2017 
were cited as indicators of socioeconomic status. The Gini coefficients and the 
concentration indexes were calculated to unveil trends in between-country 
inequality. The association between gender inequality and socioeconomic levels 
was analyzed by Pearson correlation.
RESULTS: Total age-standardized DALYs of AMD showed a slightly descending 
pattern in recent years. However, gender disparity has existed since 1990 for 
almost three decades, with female being more heavily impacted. This pattern 
became more obvious with aging and varied among different WHO and WBIL regions. 
Meanwhile, female subjects tended to have higher vision impairments. Gini 
coefficients of AMD burden increased from 0.423 to 0.448, while the ones of 
female-to-male ratio fluctuated around 0.11 between 1990 and 2017, with 
concentration indexes changing from 0.024 to -0.057 and 0.046 to 0.029 
respectively. Female-minus-male difference (r = 0.1721, p = 0.0195) and 
female-to-male ratio (r = 0.2072, p = 0.0048) of age-standardized DALYs rates 
were positively related to HDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Though global AMD health care is progressing, gender imbalance in 
disease burden of AMD distribution barely improved. Gender sensitive health 
policy should be emphasized for the increasing elder population and relieving 
the higher AMD burden of females.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Management of cryptogenic stroke involves the 
identification of modifiable risk factors, such as atrial fibrillation (AF). 
Extended rhythm monitoring increases AF detection rates but at an increased 
device cost compared with conventional Holter monitoring. The objective of the 
study was to identify and synthesize the existing literature on the 
cost-effectiveness of prolonged rhythm monitoring devices for AF detection in 
cryptogenic stroke.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of available economic evaluations of 
prolonged ECG monitoring for AF detection following cryptogenic stroke compared 
with standard care.
RESULTS: Of the 530 unique citations, 8 studies assessed the cost-utility of 
prolonged ECG monitoring compared with standard care following cryptogenic 
stroke. The prolonged ECG monitoring strategies included 7-day ambulatory 
monitoring, 30-day external loop recorders or intermittent ECG monitoring, and 
implantable loop recorders. The majority of cost-utility analyses reported 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50 000 per QALY gained; and two 
studies reported a cost-savings.
CONCLUSIONS: There is limited economic literature on the cost-effectiveness of 
extended ECG monitoring devices for detection of atrial fibrillation in 
cryptogenic stroke. In patients with cryptogenic stroke, extended ECG monitoring 
for AF detection may be economically attractive when traditional 
willingness-to-pay thresholds are adopted. However, there was substantial 
variation in the reported ICERs. The direct comparison of cost-effectiveness 
across technologies is limited by heterogeneity in modeling assumptions.

BACKGROUND: The world population is getting older. As life expectancy increases, 
traditional health care systems are facing different challenges in terms of cost 
reduction and high-quality service delivery capability. New ways to improve 
older adults' quality of life have been explored, taking advantage of new 
technological solutions. Our focus is on the integration of technology in 
clinical treatments to facilitate or deliver psychological interventions meant 
to improve well-being in older adults. Our aims were to describe the main 
technology-based interventions supporting seniors' quality of life or 
psychological well-being and to provide greater clarity to what is described in 
the current literature as their effects on seniors' cognitive and psychological 
outcomes and healthcare policies.
METHODS: We reviewed the scientific literature looking for studies that 
investigated how technology can be implemented into clinical psychology 
treatments for older adults. Our search was conducted using the following 
databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL. The search 
provided 350 articles, mostly (≈90%) dated after 2002. Abstract analysis 
narrowed the selection to 150 papers, according to their relevance and actuality 
as judged by a restricted group of independent researchers.
RESULTS: Through a thematic analysis, we found that virtual reality (VR), 
robots, telemedicine, software, video games, and smartphone applications could 
potentially support older adults' psychological treatment with a positive impact 
on healthcare systems.
CONCLUSION: Findings from the literature are encouraging, although most of these 
results are only preliminary.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), as a class of newly emerging biomarkers, have shown to 
be associated with many fundamental life processes and diseases, especially 
cancer. However, various limitations in currently available detection methods 
have seriously restricted the development of the studies associated with 
circRNA's biological functions and the diagnosis of diseases by using circRNA as 
the biomarker. By specifically designing a pair of stem-loop primers (SLPs) 
exactly recognize the junction sequence of circRNA, we firstly establish a SLP 
induced double exponential amplification method for sensitive and specific 
detection of circRNA with the ability to directly discriminate circRNA from 
linear RNA. Through the extension of SLPs during thermo cycles, one circRNA can 
generate a large amount of double stem-loop structure DNA which can initiate the 
subsequent isothermal amplification, leading to the sensitive detection of as 
low as 10 aM circRNA which is the most sensitive method for circRNA detection up 
to now. The proposed method has successfully applied to the detection of circRNA 
in many kinds of cancer cells in homogeneous solution without any separation 
step.

BACKGROUND: Ex vivo machine perfusion (EVMP) is reported to can successfully be 
applied for donor heart preservation. To respond to the organ shortage, some 
centres also accept hearts from marginal donors such as non-heart beating donors 
(NHBD) or hearts donated after cardiac death (DCD) for heart transplantation 
(HTx). Clinical as well as preclinical science on EVMP of DCD hearts seems to be 
promising but the ideal perfusion practice itself appears unclear.
OBJECTIVES: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA), this 
systematic review scopes all EVMP techniques for human and animal DCD heart 
preservation and addresses three specific questions, which refer to (a) the 
perfusion solutions, (b) the perfusion parameters and respective target values 
and (c) if possible, a direct comparison between cold static storage (CSS) and 
EVMP.
RESULTS: Search results predominantly consisted of animal studies. Either 
perfusion with a crystalloid or blood-based solution, each with cardioplegic or 
non-cardioplegic properties was used. Some perfusates were supplemented with 
specific pharmacological medication to block pathophysiological pathways, which 
are involved in ischemia/reperfusion injury or edema formation. Besides 
normothermic EVMP with oxygenated blood, a wide range of temperature was applied 
in all approaches, with the lowest temperature at 4 °C. Pressure controlled 
anterograde Langendorff perfusion was applied mostly. If investigated, 
crystalloid machine perfusion was presented superior to CSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Only blood based EVMP was introduced into clinical practice. More 
research, clinical as well as preclinical, is needed to develop the ideal EVMP 
technique, in terms of blood or crystalloid perfusion.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although some patients regret the decision to start 
dialysis, modifiable factors associated with regret have rarely been studied. We 
aimed to identify factors associated with patients' regret to initiate dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A 41-item questionnaire was 
administered to adult patients receiving maintenance dialysis in seven dialysis 
units located in Cleveland, Ohio, and its suburbs. Of the 450 patients asked to 
participate in the study, 423 agreed and 397 provided data on decisional regret. 
We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of regret, 
which was assessed using a single item, "Do you regret your decision to start 
dialysis?" We report adjusted odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CIs) for the following candidate predictors: knowledge of CKD, attitudes toward 
CKD treatment, and preference for end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Eighty-two of 397 respondents (21%) reported decisional regret. There 
were no significant demographic correlates of regret. Regret was more common 
when patients reported choosing dialysis to please doctors or family members 
(OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.27 to 4.31; P<0.001). Patients who reported having a 
prognostic discussion about life expectancy with their doctors (OR, 0.42; 95% 
CI, 0.18 to 0.98; P=0.03) and those who had completed a living will (OR, 0.48; 
95% CI, 0.25 to 0.95; P=0.03) were less likely to report regret with dialysis 
initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis regret was common in this sample. Demographic factors 
(age, sex, marital status, race, or educational attainment) were not 
significantly associated with regret, but modifiable care processes were.

5'-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) catalyzes the first step in heme 
biosynthesis, generating 5'-aminolevulinate from glycine and succinyl-CoA. 
Inherited frameshift indel mutations of human erythroid-specific isozyme ALAS2, 
within a C-terminal (Ct) extension of its catalytic core that is only present in 
higher eukaryotes, lead to gain-of-function X-linked protoporphyria (XLP). Here, 
we report the human ALAS2 crystal structure, revealing that its Ct-extension 
folds onto the catalytic core, sits atop the active site, and precludes binding 
of substrate succinyl-CoA. The Ct-extension is therefore an autoinhibitory 
element that must re-orient during catalysis, as supported by molecular dynamics 
simulations. Our data explain how Ct deletions in XLP alleviate autoinhibition 
and increase enzyme activity. Crystallography-based fragment screening reveals a 
binding hotspot around the Ct-extension, where fragments interfere with the Ct 
conformational dynamics and inhibit ALAS2 activity. These fragments represent a 
starting point to develop ALAS2 inhibitors as substrate reduction therapy for 
porphyria disorders that accumulate toxic heme intermediates.

A major factor in the progression to heart failure in humans is the inability of 
the adult heart to repair itself after injury. We recently demonstrated that the 
early postnatal mammalian heart is capable of regeneration following injury 
through proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes1,2 and that Meis1, a three 
amino acid loop extension (TALE) family homeodomain transcription factor, 
translocates to cardiomyocyte nuclei shortly after birth and mediates postnatal 
cell cycle arrest3. Here we report that Hoxb13 acts as a cofactor of Meis1 in 
postnatal cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Hoxb13 can extend 
the postnatal window of cardiomyocyte proliferation and reactivate the 
cardiomyocyte cell cycle in the adult heart. Moreover, adult Meis1-Hoxb13 
double-knockout hearts display widespread cardiomyocyte mitosis, sarcomere 
disassembly and improved left ventricular systolic function following myocardial 
infarction, as demonstrated by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing demonstrates that Meis1 and Hoxb13 
act cooperatively to regulate cardiomyocyte maturation and cell cycle. Finally, 
we show that the calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin 
dephosphorylates Hoxb13 at serine-204, resulting in its nuclear localization and 
cell cycle arrest. These results demonstrate that Meis1 and Hoxb13 act 
cooperatively to regulate cardiomyocyte maturation and proliferation and provide 
mechanistic insights into the link between hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth 
of cardiomyocytes.

Various methods have been proposed for genomic prediction (GP) in livestock. 
These methods have mainly focused on statistical considerations and did not 
include genome annotation information. In this study, to improve the predictive 
performance of carcass traits in Chinese Simmental beef cattle, we incorporated 
the genome annotation information into GP. Single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) were annotated to five genomic classes: intergenic, gene, exon, protein 
coding sequences, and 3'/5' untranslated region. Haploblocks were constructed 
for all markers and these five genomic classes by defining a biologically 
functional unit, and haplotype effects were modeled in both numerical dosage and 
categorical coding strategies. The first-order epistatic effects among SNPs and 
haplotypes were modeled using a categorical epistasis model. For all makers, the 
extension from the SNP-based model to a haplotype-based model improved the 
accuracy by 5.4-9.8% for carcass weight (CW), live weight (LW), and striploin 
(SI). For the five genomic classes using the haplotype-based prediction model, 
the incorporation of gene class information into the model improved the 
accuracies by an average of 1.4, 2.1, and 1.3% for CW, LW, and SI, respectively, 
compared with their corresponding results for all markers. Including the 
first-order epistatic effects into the prediction models improved the accuracies 
in some traits and genomic classes. Therefore, for traits with moderate-to-high 
heritability, incorporating genome annotation information of gene class into 
haplotype-based prediction models could be considered as a promising tool for GP 
in Chinese Simmental beef cattle, and modeling epistasis in prediction can 
further increase the accuracy to some degree.

Next Generation Sequencing and Machine Learning Technologies Are Painting the 
Epigenetic Portrait of Glioblastoma.

Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Even with a rare occurrence of only 1.35% of cancer cases in the United States 
of America, brain tumors are considered as one of the most lethal malignancies. 
The most aggressive and invasive type of brain tumor, glioblastoma, accounts for 
60-70% of all gliomas and presents with life expectancy of only 12-18 months. 
Despite trimodal treatment and advances in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, 
there are no significant changes in patient outcome. Our understanding of 
glioblastoma was significantly improved with the introduction of next generation 
sequencing technologies. This led to the identification of different genetic and 
molecular subtypes, which greatly improve glioblastoma diagnosis. Still, because 
of the poor life expectancy, novel diagnostic, and treatment methods are broadly 
explored. Epigenetic modifications like methylation and changes in histone 
acetylation are such examples. Recently, in addition to genetic and molecular 
characteristics, epigenetic profiling of glioblastomas is also used for sample 
classification. Further advancement of next generation sequencing technologies 
is expected to identify in detail the epigenetic signature of glioblastoma that 
can open up new therapeutic opportunities for glioblastoma patients. This should 
be complemented with the use of computational power i.e., machine and deep 
learning algorithms for objective diagnostics and design of individualized 
therapies. Using a combination of phenotypic, genotypic, and epigenetic 
parameters in glioblastoma diagnostics will bring us closer to precision 
medicine where therapies will be tailored to suit the genetic profile and 
epigenetic signature of the tumor, which will grant longer life expectancy and 
better quality of life. Still, a number of obstacles including potential bias, 
availability of data for minorities in heterogeneous populations, data 
protection, and validation and independent testing of the learning algorithms 
have to be overcome on the way.

Background: Mental disorders is one of the main causes of disability and lower 
life expectancy among patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The present trial 
aimed to examine the efficacy of multi-strain probiotic supplementation on 
circulating levels of BDNF, NGF, IL-6 and mental health in patients with 
MS.Methods: This trial was conducted among 70 patients with MS that referred to 
the MS Association. Patients were randomized into intervention and control 
groups to receive 2 multi-strain probiotic capsules or placebo, daily for six 
months. Serum BDNF, NGF and IL-6 was measured by ELISA kits. Mental health 
parameters were assessed by valid questionnaires in the baseline and end of the 
study.Results: Of the 70 patients enrolled in this study, 65 subjects were 
included in the final analysis. From baseline to 6 months, probiotic 
supplementation resulted in a significant increase in BDNF and a significant 
reduction in the IL-6 levels (P < 0.001). Our findings revealed that probiotic 
supplementation compared to placebo caused a significant improvement in the 
general health questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) (-5.31 ± 4.62 vs. -1.81 ± 4.23; 
P = 0.002), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) (-4.81 ± 0.79 vs. 
-1.90 ± 0.96; P = 0.001), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (-3.81 ± 6.56 vs. 
0.24 ± 5.44; P = 0.007) and Pain Rating Index (PRI) (-3.15 ± 4.51 vs. 
-0.09 ± 3.67; P = 0.004). However, we not found any significant difference 
between the two groups in other factors (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Overall, six 
months of probiotic supplementation resulted in greater improvement in mental 
health parameters.

University, Navi Mumbai, India.

In this era of green technology, plasma technology is one of the novel 
techniques intended towards many industries including food industry as a 
principal application due to less utilization of energy, solvents, and water 
with minimum impact on food quality. The foremost purpose behind the utilization 
of nonthermal plasma processing (cold plasma) lies in the retention of freshness 
of food products along with furtherance of sensory properties as well as 
functional and nutritional composition. In addition, this technique assists in 
shelf life extension and carries out desirable modifications in the structure of 
food and packaging material. This technology has been proven to be advantageous 
over other technologies since all these processes are carried out at low 
temperature, hence is highly suitable for heat-sensitive materials. The present 
review summarizes the mechanism of this plasma technology along with its 
benefits to the industry, for example improvements in cooking quality, 
enhancements in enzyme activity, modification of starches, and microbial 
inactivation. Also, the effects of plasma treatment on characteristics of 
various food products have been elaborated in this review.

Deaths: Final Data for 2017.

Kochanek KD, Murphy SL, Xu J, Arias E.

Objectives-This report presents final 2017 data on U.S. deaths, death rates, 
life expectancy, infant mortality, and trends, by selected characteristics such 
as age, sex, Hispanic origin and race, state of residence, and cause of death. 
Methods-Information reported on death certificates is presented in descriptive 
tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. 
Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital 
Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. 
Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Results-In 2017, a total of 2,813,503 
deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 731.9 
deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 0.4% from the 2016 
rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.6 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from the 
2016 rate. Life expectancy decreased from 2016 to 2017 for non-Hispanic white 
males (0.1 year) and non-Hispanic black males (0.1), and increased for non- 
Hispanic black females (0.1). Age-specific death rates increased in 2017 from 
2016 for age groups 25-34, 35-44, and 85 and over, and decreased for age groups 
under 1 and 45-54. The 15 leading causes of death in 2017 remained the same as 
in 2016 although, two causes exchanged ranks. Chronic liver disease and 
cirrhosis, the 12th leading cause of death in 2016, became the 11th leading 
cause of death in 2017, while Septicemia, the 11th leading cause of death in 
2016, became the 12th leading cause of death in 2017. The infant mortality rate, 
5.79 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017, did not change significantly 
from the rate of 5.87 in 2016. Conclusions-The age-adjusted death rate for the 
total, male, and female populations increased from 2016 to 2017 and life 
expectancy at birth decreased in 2017 for the total and male populations.

United States Life Tables, 2017.

Arias E.

Objectives-This report presents complete period life tables for the United 
States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on age-specific death rates in 
2017. Methods-Data used to prepare the 2017 life tables are 2017 final mortality 
statistics; July 1, 2017 population estimates based on the 2010 decennial 
census; and 2017 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to 
estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that 
developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 
2006. The methodology used to estimate the 2017 life tables for all other groups 
was first implemented with data year 2008. Results-In 2017, the overall 
expectation of life at birth was 78.6 years, decreasing from 78.7 in 2016. 
Between 2016 and 2017, life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year for males 
(76.2 to 76.1) and did not change for females (81.1). Life expectancy at birth 
decreased by 0.1 year for the white population (78.9 to 78.8) and the 
non-Hispanic white population (78.6 to 78.5) between 2016 and 2017. Life 
expectancy at birth did not change from 2016 for the black population (75.3), 
the non-Hispanic black population (74.9), and the Hispanic population (81.8).

Recent advances in multiple myeloma include numerous approvals of novel 
therapies with unprecedented efficacy, a rapid and sustained tempo of new drug 
development, and further refinements to prognostication to include minimal 
residual disease (MRD) testing and improved risk stratification. The upfront use 
of immunomodulatory drug and proteasome inhibitor combinations followed by 
maintenance has resulted in transformative clinical benefit. Four-drug regimens 
incorporating monoclonal antibodies are reporting unprecedented rates of 
complete response and MRD negativity in the absence of intensification. In the 
context of these advances, the added value of high-dose melphalan with 
autologous stem-cell transplant (HDM-ASCT) is a key question. From a safety 
standpoint, HDM-ASCT is associated with both acute toxicities that reduce 
quality of life and long-term toxicities that may limit life expectancy for some 
patients. The present review discusses the recent advances in induction therapy, 
the impact of these advances on HDM-ASCT, the evolving role of MRD testing and 
the short- and long-term risks of HDM-ASCT. Recognising that prospective data 
remains limited, we suggest that HDM-ASCT not be considered mandatory for 
eligible newly diagnosed patients who are treated with highly efficacious 
regimens and achieve deep responses, but rather be held in reserve without early 
exposure to the clinical and genomic toxicity inherent to this approach.

Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model organism in neurodegeneration and 
aging research. Oxidative stress and formation of advanced glycation endproducts 
(AGEs), as they occur under hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes mellitus, 
contribute to neuronal damage and lifespan reduction. Sulforaphane (SFN) is an 
indirect antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is a direct antioxidant that 
acts as a free radical scavenger. Aim of this study is to investigate the 
protective effects of SFN and vitamin E against glucotoxic damages to the 
neuronal system and lifespan in C. elegans. Culture conditions that mimic 
clinical hyperglycemia increased the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
(p<0.001) and the accumulation of methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation 
endproducts (MG-derived AGEs) (p<0.01) with subsequent neuronal damage and 
neuronal dysfunction, ultimately leading to a significant shortening of lifespan 
(p<0.01). Treatment with both, 20 µmol/l SFN and 200 µg/ml vitamin E, completely 
prevented the increase in ROS and MG-derived AGEs, abolished the glucotoxic 
effects on neuronal structure and function, and preserved lifespan, resulting in 
a life expectancy similar to untreated controls. These data emphasize the 
relevance of indirect and direct antioxidants as potential therapeutic options 
for the prevention of glucotoxic pathologies.

The autogenous self-healing of cementitious material micro-cracks might lead to 
the service-life extension of structures. However, most of its aspects are still 
unknown. This paper investigates the self-healing capacity of ternary cement 
blends including metakaolin (MK), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (BFS), 
limestone (LS), and siliceous filler (F). Morphology and healing precipitation 
patterns were studied through the optical microscopy of artificial micro-cracks, 
global healing product mass monitoring, and XRD and TGA used to identify and 
quantify mineral formation. The self-healing potential index is introduced based 
on the mass measurements. It was found that the formulation containing 10% MK 
presented the highest healing potential at an early age (<28 days), while the 
formulations containing 20% BFS with 10% LS/F showed a higher healing potential 
at an older age (cracked after 28 days of curing). Calcite, C-S-H, and 
portlandite were found to be the main healing products alongside specific 
formulation-dependent compounds, and it was observed that the calcite's relative 
quantity generally increased with time. Finally, the evolution of the 
self-healing product phases was accurately monitored through XRD and TGA 
measurements.

Aging is one of the major risk factors for suffering cardiovascular and 
metabolic diseases. Due to the increase in life expectancy, there is a strong 
interest in the search for anti-aging strategies to treat and prevent these 
aging-induced disorders. Both omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) and 
extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) exert numerous metabolic and cardiovascular 
benefits in the elderly. In addition, EVOO constitutes an interesting ingredient 
to stabilize ω-3 PUFA and decrease their oxidation process due to its high 
content in antioxidant compounds. ω-3 PUFA are commonly obtained from fish. 
However, more ecological and sustainable sources, such as algae oil (AO) can 
also be used. In this study, we aimed to study the possible beneficial effect of 
an oil mixture composed by EVOO (75%) and AO (25%) rich in ω-3 PUFA (35% 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 20% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) on the 
cardiometabolic alterations associated with aging. For this purpose; young 
(three months old) and old (24 months old) male Wistar rats were treated with 
vehicle or with the oil mixture (2.5 mL/kg) for 21 days. Treatment with the oil
