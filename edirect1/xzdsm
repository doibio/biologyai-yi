BACKGROUND: Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax has been 
shown to reduce initial hospitalisation, but at the expense of increase adverse 
events. As a result, questions remain about the cost-effectiveness of this 
option.
OBJECTIVES: A within-trial economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled 
trial was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ambulatory care when 
compared with standard guideline-based management.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either an ambulatory 
device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube 
insertion or both). Follow-up was 12 months. Outcomes included healthcare 
resource use and costs, quality of life, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: 236 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to ambulatory care 
(n=117) and standard care (n=119). After multiple imputation for missing data, 
patients in the ambulatory care group had significantly lower National Health 
Service healthcare costs (-£788, 95% CI difference: -1527 to -50; p=0.037) than 
those in the standard care group. There were no differences in the number of 
QALYs gained (mean difference: -0.001, 95% CI difference: -0.032 to 0.030; 
p=0.95). When standard care was compared with ambulatory care, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was £799 066 per QALY gained, well above current 
thresholds of cost-effectiveness. As a result, the probability of ambulatory 
care being cost-effective was 0.93.
CONCLUSION: Outpatient ambulatory management is highly likely to be a 
cost-effective option in the management of primary pneumothorax.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) exhibit significantly increased 
chronic diseases and premature death. Abnormalities in DNA methylation are 
associated with development of chronic diseases and reduced life expectancy. We 
investigated the hypothesis that anti-cancer treatments are associated with 
long-term DNA methylation changes that could be key drivers of adverse late 
health effects.
METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using MethylationEPIC arrays 
in paired samples (before/after therapy) from 32 childhood cancer patients. 
Separately, methylation was determined in 32 samples from different adult CCS 
(mean 22-years post-diagnosis) and compared with cancer-free controls (n = 284).
RESULTS: Widespread DNA methylation changes were identified post-treatment in 
childhood cancer patients, including 146 differentially methylated regions 
(DMRs), which were consistently altered in the 32 post-treatment samples. 
Analysis of adult CCS identified matching methylation changes at 107/146 of the 
DMRs, suggesting potential long-term retention of post-therapy changes. Adult 
survivors also exhibited epigenetic age acceleration, independent of DMR 
methylation. Furthermore, altered methylation at the DUSP6 DMR was significantly 
associated with early mortality, suggesting altered methylation may be 
prognostic for some late adverse health effects in CCS.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel methylation changes could serve as biomarkers for 
assessing normal cell toxicity in ongoing treatments and predicting long-term 
health outcomes in CCS.

BACKGROUND: Lysine variants of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) result from 
incomplete clipping of the C-terminal lysine residues of the heavy chain. 
Although the structure of the lysine variants has been determined for several 
mAb products, a detailed study that investigates the impact of lysine charge 
variants on PK/PD and preclinical safety is yet to be published.
OBJECTIVE: An in-depth investigation of the impact of C- terminal lysine 
clipping of mAbs on safety and efficacy for bevacizumab charge variants.
METHOD: Charge variant isolation using semi-preparative chromatography is 
followed by a comparative analysis of FcRn binding, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics in relevant animal models.
RESULTS: K1 variant exhibited improved FcRn binding affinity (4-fold), half-life 
(1.3-fold), and anti-tumor activity (1.3-fold) as compared to the K0 (main) 
product. However, the K2 variant, even though exhibited higher FcRn affinity 
(2-fold), displayed lower half-life (1.6-fold) and anti-tumor activity at medium 
and low doses. Differential proteomic analysis revealed that seven pathways 
(such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, carbon metabolism, synthesis of amino 
acids) were significantly enriched. Higher efficacy of the K1 variant is likely 
due to higher bioavailability of the drug, leading to complete downregulation of 
the pathways that facilitate catering of the energy requirements of the 
proliferating tumor cells. On the contrary, the K2 variant exhibits a shorter 
half-life, resulting only in partial reduction in the metabolic/energy 
requirements of the growing tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: Overall, we conclude that the mAb half-life, dosage, and efficacy of 
a biotherapeutic product are significantly impacted by the charge variant 
profile of a biotherapeutic product.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women and a leading 
cause of death. Elderly people have a higher incidence of breast cancer since it 
increases with age. Furthermore, the extended life expectancy and advances in 
imaging techniques have led to an increased number of cases. Guidelines 
concerning the management of this specific age group are rare, mainly due to 
underrepresentation of seniors in clinical trials. Moreover, increased frailty, 
comorbidities, and a poor performance status make it complex to determine the 
best therapeutic approach.
SUMMARY: In this review, we attempt to summarize the current literature and aim 
to provide specific approaches and recommendations for prompt diagnosis, 
treatment, and management of breast cancer in the elderly.
KEY MESSAGES: The establishment of applicable protocols is imperative and 
efforts are being made in this direction. A careful geriatric assessment and 
adequate consultation should be the standard of care and patient's preferences 
should always be considered.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, the effects of overexpression of thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) 
on aging and age-related diseases were examined using Trx2 transgenic mice 
[Tg(TXN2]+/0]. Because our previous studies demonstrated that thioredoxin (Trx) 
overexpression in the cytosol (Trx1) did not extend maximum lifespan, this study 
was conducted to test if increased Trx2 expression in mitochondria shows 
beneficial effects on aging and age-related pathology.
METHODS: Trx2 transgenic mice were generated using a fragment of the human 
genome containing the TXN2 gene. Effects of Trx2 overexpression on survival, 
age-related pathology, oxidative stress, and redox-sensitive signaling pathways 
were examined in male Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice.
RESULTS: Trx2 levels were significantly higher (approximately 1.6- to 5-fold) in 
all of the tissues we examined in Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice compared to wild-type (WT) 
littermates, and the expression levels were maintained during aging (up to 22-24 
months old). Trx2 overexpression did not alter the levels of Trx1, glutaredoxin, 
glutathione, or other major antioxidant enzymes. Overexpression of Trx2 was 
associated with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from 
mitochondria and lower isoprostane levels compared to WT mice. When we conducted 
the survival study, male Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice showed a slight extension 
(approximately 8-9%] of mean, median, and 10th percentile lifespans; however, 
the survival curve was not significantly different from WT mice. Cross-sectional 
pathological analysis (22-24 months old) showed that Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice had a 
slightly higher severity of lymphoma; however, tumor burden, disease burden, and 
severity of glomerulonephritis and inflammation were similar to WT mice. Trx2 
overexpression was also associated with higher c-Jun and c-Fos levels; however, 
mTOR activity and levels of NFκB p65 and p50 were similar to WT littermates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the increased levels of Trx2 in 
mitochondria over the lifespan in Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice showed a slight 
life-extending effect, reduced ROS production from mitochondria and oxidative 
damage to lipids, but showed no significant effects on aging and age-related 
diseases.

A decline in estrogen levels during menopause is associated with the loss of 
muscle mass and function, and it can accelerate sarcopenia. However, with the 
growing number of postmenopausal women due to the increase in life expectancy, 
the effects of estrogen on skeletal muscle are not completely understood. This 
article reviews the relationship between estrogen deficiency and skeletal 
muscle, its potential mechanisms, including those involving mitochondria, and 
the effects of exercise on estrogen deficiency-induced skeletal muscle 
impairment. In particular, mitochondrial dysfunction induced by estrogen 
deficiency accelerates sarcopenia via mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and 
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. It is well known that exercise training is 
essential for health, including for the improvement of sarcopenia. This review 
highlights the importance of exercise training (aerobic and resistance exercise) 
as a therapeutic intervention against estrogen deficiency-induced sarcopenia.

Rotavirus, one of the main pathogens causing morbidity and mortality in neonatal 
dairy calves worldwide, is responsible for 30-44% of cattle deaths. It is 
considered to be the most common etiologic agent of diarrhea in neonatal dairy 
calves and children, the dominant type being group A. Two hundred seventy 
animals from 27 farms from 2 regions of Kuwait were tested for the presence of 
Rotavirus serogroup A (RVA) using latex agglutination test (LAT) and reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain (RT-PCR) testing. RVA non-structural proteins 
NSP1-2, NSP4-5 and capsid protein genes VP1-7 were characterized by next 
generation sequencing. LAT was positive in 15.56% of the animals, and RT-PCR in 
28.89%. Using RT-PCR as a reference method, LAT was 100% specific but only 
83.33% sensitive. ANOVA analysis showed correlation only with the location of 
the farms but no significant correlation with the age and sex of the animals. 
Although there was a tendency of clustering of RVA positive animals, it did not 
reach statistical significance (p = 0.035 for LAT). The phylogenetic analysis 
showed that Kuwaiti isolates of group A rotavirus clustered with human 
rotaviruses. Taken together, it seems that rotavirus was present in most of the 
dairy farms in Kuwait. The high occurrence of the virus in calves in Kuwaiti 
dairy farms and the close phylogenetic affinity with human isolates warrants 
urgent action to minimize and control its spread between calves in farms.

Predicting individual effects of switching from standard half-life (SHL) to 
extended half-life (EHL) FVIII/FIX concentrates is pivotal in clinical care, but 
large-scale individual data are scarce. The aim of this study was to assess 
individual changes in terminal half-life (THL) after switching to EHL 
concentrates and identifying determinants of a clinically relevant THL extension 
in people with severe hemophilia. Data from participants with pharmacokinetic 
studies on both SHL and EHL were extracted from the Web-Accessible Population 
Pharmacokinetics Service (WAPPS) database and stratified according to hemophilia 
type and age groups (children/adults). A 30% increase in THL was considered 
clinically relevant. Predictors of a relevant increase were identified using 
logistic regression. Data from 688 persons with severe hemophilia (2174 
infusions) were included: 89% hemophilia A; median age: 21.7 (interquartile 
range [IQR]: 11.5-37.7); positive inhibitor history: 11.7%. THL increased by 38% 
(IQR: 17%-67%) and 212% (139%-367%) for hemophilia A and B, respectively. All 
EHL-FIX concentrate users showed clinically relevant THL extension. However, 40% 
(242/612) of people with hemophilia A showed limited extension or decrease in 
THL after switching. Relevant FVIII-THL extension was predicted by short 
baseline THL and blood group non-O in both children and adults. In conclusion, 
clinically relevant THL extension was observed in all 75/76 participants 
switching to EHL-FIX, and in 60% of 612 switching to EHL-FVIII. Short THL on 
SHL-FVIII and blood group non-O were identified as predictors for a relevant THL 
increase after switching to EHL-FVIII. Individualized pharmacokinetic assessment 
may guide clinical decision-making when switching from SHL to EHL-FVIII.

BACKGROUND: Understanding life expectancy can help persons with dementia, their 
care partners, and policymakers plan for what lies ahead. We sought to determine 
life expectancy and predictors of mortality for community-dwelling persons with 
dementia and severe disability.
METHODS: Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) linked to 
Medicare claims, we identified community-dwelling respondents age 65+ who 
entered NHATS in 2011 with dementia and severe disability (defined as three 
impairments in activities of daily living), or who subsequently met criteria for 
dementia and then severe disability. We estimated time to death based on the 
timing of meeting severe disability criteria. We conducted parametric survival 
analyses using a Gompertz distribution to calculate risk of death and predicted 
median time to death. Predictors included demographic, functional, clinical 
characteristics, and behavioral symptoms (assessed among NHATS respondents with 
proxy interviews).
RESULTS: Among 842 community-dwelling persons with dementia and severe 
disability, 80.5% died during the study period. After adjusting for age and 
gender, overall predicted median time to death was 1.7 years (25th percentile 
0.6, 75th percentile 3.8 years). Six notable characteristics were associated 
with shorter life expectancy: 1) older age (90+), with a predicted median time 
to death of 1.0 year (0.4, 2.1); 2) being bedbound, 1.1 years (0.4, 2.3); 3) 
being homebound, 1.2 years (0.5, 2.6); 4) having comorbid cancer, 1.2 years 
(0.5, 2.6); 5) unintended weight loss, 1.4 years (0.5, 3.1); and 6) comorbid 
depression, 1.5 years (0.6, 3.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Community-dwelling persons with dementia and severe disability 
lived a median of 1.7 years. Clinicians can use the study findings to provide 
anticipatory guidance to patients and care partners, and policymakers to inform 
design of longitudinal supportive services.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide continues to increase, in 
particular in India. Early T2DM diagnosis followed by appropriate management 
will result in more cardiovascular event free life years. However, knowledge of 
the cardiovascular profile of newly diagnosed T2DM patients is still limited. 
The aim of this study was to understand the extent of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk of newly diagnosed T2DM patients in India.
METHODS: A cross sectional observational study was conducted to evaluate 
clinical laboratory and socio-demographic parameters of 5,080 newly diagnosed 
T2DM patients (48.3 ± 12.8 years of age; 36.7% female). In addition, we 
determined their cardiovascular risk according to the guidelines of the Lipid 
Association of India (LAI) and the criteria of the QRISK3 score.
RESULTS: Of the newly T2DM diagnosed patients in India 2,007(39.5%) were 
classified as "High risk" and 3,073 (60.5%) were classified as "Very high risk" 
based on LAI criteria. On average, patients had 1.7 ± 0.9 major atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors. Low HDL-C value was the most 
frequent major risk (2,823; 55.6%) followed by high age (2,502; 49.3%), 
hypertension (2,141; 42.1%), smoking/tobacco use (1,078; 21.2%) and chronic 
kidney disease stage 3b or higher (568; 11.2%). In addition, 4,192 (82.5%) 
patients appeared to have at least one cholesterol abnormality and, if the 
latest LAI recommendations are applied, 96.5% (4,902) presented with lipid 
values above recommended targets. Based on the QRISK3 calculation Indian 
diabetes patients had an average CVD risk of 15.3 ± 12.3%, (12.2 ± 10.1 vs. 17.1 
± 13.5 [p<0.001] for females and males, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Newly diagnosed Indian T2DM patients are at high ASCVD risk. Our 
data therefore support the notion that further extension of nationwide ASCVD 
risk identification programs and prevention strategies to reduce the occurrence 
of cardiovascular diseases are warranted.

Telemedicine, which integrates medicine, communication, engineering, information 
and other disciplines, is a hot emerging cross field in recent years. With the 
development of telecommunication technology and surgical robot, telesurgery is 
regarded as the "crown pearl" in telemedicine and has attracted more and more 
attention. As an extension of traditional surgery, telesurgery greatly extends 
the connotation and concept of surgery and embodies the great leap forward 
development of surgical technology. Despite the current limitations such as 
network delay, transparency of remote robot operation and team construction of 
surgeons, telesurgery has still formed a variety of innovative application 
scenarios and achieved rapid development in China in recent years. In view of 
the uneven distribution of medical resources in China and the epidemic of 
COVID-19 in the world, this paper puts forward the possible problems and 
solutions in the development of telesurgery, and looks forward to the 
feasibility of telesurgery technology in process of shifting the focus of 
medical and health care down to the community level, channeling resources 
accordingly.

This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of rehabilitation in patients 
with limb-girdle disease, who were given a home exercise program and called for 
follow-up in certain periods by observing the functional areas of the shoulder 
and pelvic groups every six months. Suitable statistical methods were conducted. 
Descriptive findings and continuous variables regarding the patients were 
presented. As a result of the analyses, no statistically significant difference 
was found only in pre-treatment and post-treatment wrist strength and trunk 
extension variables, but a statistically significant difference was found 
between the pre-treatment and post-treatment scores of all other types of 
strength. Significant differences were found between the pre-treatment and 
post-treatment cervical flexion strength in terms of general weakness and 
inability to walk, joint limitation and walking status. It is believed that the 
rehabilitation method to be applied to patients with limb-girdle muscular 
dystrophy (LGMD) detected in the early period will provide effective results and 
may form the basis for referring them to physicians and health professionals. It 
has been concluded that rehabilitation will help them lead a comfortable life.

A few studies examined the comparative side effects of Coronavirus Disease-19 
(COVID-19) vaccines. We compared the extension and severity of self-reported 
side effects of seven COVID-19 vaccines [BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), ChAdOx1 
(AstraZeneca), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences), 
Gam-COVID-Vac (Gamaleya's Sputnik V), Ad5-nCoV (CanSinoBIO), and Ad26.CoV2.S 
(Johnson & Johnson/Janssen)] in the Mexican population. We also evaluated the 
association of type of vaccine, sex, age, comorbidity, and history of allergies 
to the extent and severity of side effects. This was a cross-sectional study 
carried out online between August 12 and September 3, 2021 in Mexico. The first 
inclusion criterion was to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and the second, being at 
least 18 years old. The survey link was distributed via multiple social media 
platforms. We questioned about the type of vaccine and symptoms based on 
short-term side effects reported in the literature. Side effect extension was 
classified as local, systemic, or both. We asked about the need to take 
medicine, stop activities/miss work, or seek medical attention. Then, a severity 
index was constructed based on responses. Descriptive and stepwise multivariate 
logistic ordinal regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 
95% CI for each outcome adjusted by potential confounders. The mean age was 38.9 
± 11.0 years (n = 4,024). Prevalence of at least one side effect varied between 
vaccines and by a number of doses. At dose 1, ChAdOx1 was the vaccine with the 
highest rate of at least one side effect (85%) followed by Gam-COVID-Vac (80%). 
Both were associated to greater extension (adjusted OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.16, 2.96 
and adjusted OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.76, 3.29, respectively) and severity of side 
effects (adjusted OR 4.32, 95% CI 3.73, 5.00 and adjusted OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.28, 
3.94, respectively). Young age (<50 years), female sex, comorbidity, and history 
of allergies were associated with greater extension and severity, independent of 
the type of vaccine and potential confounders. At dose 2, mRNA-1273 was the 
vaccine with the highest rate of side effects (88%) and the only vaccine 
associated to greater extension (adjusted OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.59, 5.21) and 
severity of symptoms (adjusted OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.82, 5.43). Continuous studies 
are necessary to acknowledge more post-vaccine symptoms in different 
populations.

This paper offers an evaluation index system of agricultural green development 
level based on the Rural Vitalization Strategy. The evaluation index system 
includes four dimensions: agricultural development, ecological resource 
protection, environment-friendly, and industrial extension and integration. 
Then, the paper calculates the level of agricultural green development in the 
three provinces of Northeast China using the entropy-gray correlation method 
from 2009 to 2019. The calculation results show that between 2009 and 2019, the 
level of agricultural green development in the three northeastern provinces of 
China fluctuates and increases, and there is some variation between them: in 
terms of the overall level of agricultural green development Heilongjiang 
Province > Liaoning Province > Jilin Province, in terms of the average change 
speed of agricultural green development level, Heilongjiang Province > Liaoning 
Province > Jilin Province; in terms of each dimension, the average level of 
correlation degree of agricultural development dimension is Liaoning Province > 
Heilongjiang Province > Jilin Province, the average level of correlation degree 
of ecological resource protection dimension is Heilongjiang Province > Jilin 
Province > Liaoning Province, the average level of correlation degree of 
environment-friendly dimension is Heilongjiang Province > Jilin Province > 
Liaoning Province, and the average level of correlation degree of industrial 
extension and integration is Liaoning Province > Heilongjiang Province > Jilin 
Province. Finally, the basis of the calculation results, combined with the 
actual situation of agricultural development in the three provinces, the 
countermeasures, and suggestions for promoting the green development of 
agriculture are put forward. Specifically, it includes the establishment of an 
evaluation system for agricultural green development; strengthening the 
protection of agricultural ecological resources; increasing rural environmental 
governance; promoting the integrated development of rural tertiary industries; 
vigorously supporting agricultural scientific and technological innovation; and 
strengthening regional cooperation and other suggestions.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of subaxial spinal metastases increases due to longer 
life expectancy resulting from successful modern cancer treatments. The three 
most utilized approaches for surgical treatment include the anterior, posterior, 
and combined approaches. However, despite increasing surgical volume, data on 
the postoperative complication profiles of different operative approaches for 
this patient population is scarce.
METHODS: The institutional databases of two large referral centers in Thailand 
were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with subaxial cervical spine metastasis 
who underwent cervical surgery during 2005 to 2015 were identified and enrolled. 
Clinical presentations, baseline characteristics, operative approach, 
perioperative complications, and postoperative outcomes, including pain, 
neurological recovery, and survival, were compared among the three surgical 
approaches.
RESULTS: The 70 patients (44 with anterior approach, 14 with posterior approach, 
12 with combined approach) were enrolled. There were no statistically 
significant differences in preoperative characteristics, including Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI), Tomita score, and Revised Tokuhashi score, among the 
three groups. There were no significant differences among groups for medical 
complications, surgical complications, neurological recovery, verbal pain score 
improvement, survival time, or ambulatory status improvement. However, the 
combined approach did show a significantly higher rate of overall perioperative 
complications (p = 0.01), intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.001), and operative 
time (p < 0.001) compared to the other two approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the combined approach group had the highest rates of 
perioperative complications. However, although the differences were not 
statistically significant, patients in the combined group tended to have better 
clinical outcomes after follow-up and the longest survival time.

BACKGROUND: Amidst the rising breast cancer burden in Asia, we aim to predict 
the future mortality risk due to breast cancer and identify the 
risk-attributable deaths for breast cancer among East and South Asian countries.
METHODS: We used country-level data to predict the trends in the next decade 
relating to female breast cancer mortality by employing data from 1990 to 2019 
from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. We used the stochastic mortality 
modeling and prediction techniques to forecast the age-specific and 
risk-attributable breast cancer mortality trends at the regional and national 
levels of East and South Asia.
RESULTS: The number of deaths caused by the breast cancer is predicted to 
increase in East and South Asian countries in the next decade (2020-2030). 
Age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of breast cancer is predicted to increase by 
7.0% from 9.20/100,000 (95% CI: 6.04-12.12) in 1990 to 9.88/100,000 (95% CI: 
7.12-11.4) in 2030 in East Asia, and about 35% increase from 13.4/100,000 (95% 
CI: 9.21-16.02) in 1990 to 18.1/100,000 (95% CI: 13.23-21.10) in 2030 in South 
Asia. At the national level, the highest percent change in ASDR between 1990 and 
2030 was reported in Pakistan (a 62% increase) and Nepal (a 47% increase). The 
highest percent change in breast cancer mortality between 2020 and 2030 for 
females of age group 80-84 years was observed in Pakistan [21.6, (95% CI, 
20.6-94.7)], followed by Afghanistan [13.3 (4.0-80.8)], and Nepal [36.6 
(11.1-125.7)] as compared to the other countries. In the females of aged 50-80 
years, the predicted death rates were associated with high body mass index, 
high-fasting plasma glucose, and diet high in red meat, across the majority of 
countries under study. Furthermore, reductions in percent change in mortality 
rates occurred in several countries with increases in sociodemographic index 
(SDI), notably across high SDI countries.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer mortality risk varies substantially across East and 
South Asian countries with higher mortality risk in low/middle SDI countries. 
Early detection using screening, awareness among females and health workers, and 
cost-effective and timely treatment of patients with breast cancer is vital in 
stemming the tide of breast cancer in the next decade.

Enhanced quality of health care and increased life expectancy come with issues 
about the quality of life. This challenge is especially relevant to physical 
medicine and rehabilitation (PM and R)-a specialty focused on enhancing the 
quality of life. With the increasing burden of chronic diseases and disabling 
conditions, requirement for PM and R specialists will increase. This narrative 
review discusses the changing demographics, the disability trends, and the unmet 
needs both at present and anticipated in future. We also discussed problems 
faced by the present training system in PM and R, identified the lacunae, and 
attempted to provide suggestions to fill those.

AIMS: Access to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is sometimes restricted for 
patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2). This study compares the cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with TKA in patients with a BMI 
above and below 40 kg/m2 to examine whether this is supported.
METHODS: This single-centre study compared 169 consecutive patients with severe 
obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) (mean age 65.2 years (40 to 87); mean BMI 44.2 kg/m2 
(40 to 66); 129/169 female) undergoing unilateral TKA to a propensity score 
matched (age, sex, preoperative Oxford Knee Score (OKS)) cohort with a BMI < 40 
kg/m2 in a 1:1 ratio. Demographic data, comorbidities, and complications to one 
year were recorded. Preoperative and one-year patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) were completed: EuroQol five-dimension three-level questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-3L), OKS, pain, and satisfaction. Using national life expectancy data 
with obesity correction and the 2020 NHS National Tariff, QALYs (discounted at 
3.5%), and direct medical costs accrued over a patient's lifetime, were 
calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to model variation 
in cost/QALY for each cohort across 1,000 simulations.
RESULTS: All PROMs improved significantly (p < 0.05) in both groups without 
differences between groups. Early complications were higher in BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2: 
34/169 versus 52/169 (p = 0.050). A total of 16 (9.5%) patients with a BMI ≥ 40 
kg/m2 were readmitted within one year with six reoperations (3.6%) including 
three (1.2%) revisions for infection. Assuming reduced life expectancy in severe 
obesity and revision costs, TKA in patients with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 costs a mean 
of £1,013/QALY (95% confidence interval £678 to 1,409) more over a lifetime than 
TKA in patients with BMI < 40 kg/m2. In PSA replicates, the maximum cost/QALY 
was £3,921 in patients with a BMI < 40 kg/m2 and £5,275 in patients with a BMI ≥ 
40 kg/m2.
CONCLUSION: Higher complication rates following TKA in severely obese patients 
result in a lifetime cost/QALY that is £1,013 greater than that for patients 
with BMI < 40 kg/m2, suggesting that TKA remains a cost-effective use of 
healthcare resources in severely obese patients where the surgeon considers it 
appropriate. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2022;104-B(4):452-463.
