BACKGROUND: Reducing premature deaths is an important step towards achieving the 
World Health Organization's sustainable development goal. Redeployed miners are 
more prone to disease or premature death due to the special occupational 
characteristics. Our aims were to describe the deaths of redeployed miners, 
assess the losses due to premature death and identify their main health 
problems. All the records of individuals were obtained from Fuxin Mining Area 
Social Security Administration Center. Year of life lost (YLL) and average year 
of life lost were used to assess the loss due to premature death. YLL rates per 
1000 individuals were considered to compare deaths from different populations.
RESULTS: Circulatory system diseases contributed the most years of life lost in 
the causes of death, followed by neoplasms. But average year of life lost in 
neoplasms was 6.85, higher than circulatory system diseases, 5.63. 
Cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease were the main causes of death 
in circulatory system diseases. And average years of life lost in 
cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease were 5.85 and 5.62, higher 
than those in other circulatory system diseases. Lung cancer was the principal 
cause of death in neoplasms. Average year of life lost in liver cancer was 7.92, 
the highest in neoplasms.
CONCLUSIONS: For redeployed miners, YLL rates per 1000 individuals in 
cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and lung cancer were higher than 
those in other populations, especially in men. It is important to attach 
importance to the health of redeployed miners, take appropriate measures to 
reduce premature death and achieve the sustainable development goal. Our 
findings also contribute to a certain theoretical reference for other countries 
that face or will face the same problem.

Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders, is caused by 
mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In spite of 
significant improvement in patient life expectancy, the disease remains lethal 
and incurable. Clinically, CF lung disease claims the most morbidity and 
mortality, characterized by chronic bacterial infection, persistent neutrophilic 
inflammation, and purulent small airway obstruction. Although all these 
manifestations are highly associated with neutrophils, the actual role of this 
phagocyte in the disease pathogenesis has not been fully appreciated. One of the 
major obstacles impeding such progress is the lack of CF neutrophil cell lines. 
Taking advantage of the new CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, we have 
generated a homozygous ΔF508-CF promyelocytic cell line from HL-60 cells, from 
which unlimited CF neutrophil cells can be differentiated. The derived cells 
showed defective CFTR presentation, deficient phagosomal hypochlorous acid 
(HOCl) production, and compromised microbial killing. Such a phenotype 
recapitulates that of primary neutrophils from CF patients. Thus, the 
established human CF promyelocytic cell line should be a useful tool for future 
CF basic research and drug screening.

With advances in multimodality therapy, childhood cancer cure rates approach 
80%. However, both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause debilitating or even 
fatal late adverse events that are critical to understand, mitigate or prevent. 
QUANTEC (Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) 
identified radiation dose constraints for normal tissues in adults and pointed 
out the uncertainties in those constraints. The range of adverse events seen in 
children is different from that in adults, in part due to the 
vulnerability/characteristics of radiation damage to developing tissues, and in 
part due to the typical body sites affected by childhood cancer that lead to 
collateral irradiation of somewhat different normal tissues and organs compared 
with adults. Many childhood cancer survivors have a long life expectancy and may 
develop treatment-induced secondary cancers and severe organ/tissue injury 10, 
20 or more years after treatment. Collaborative long-term observational studies 
and clinical research programmes for survivors of paediatric and adolescent 
cancer provide adverse event data for follow-up periods exceeding 40 years. Data 
analysis is challenging due to the interaction between therapeutic and 
developmental variables, the lack of radiation dose-volume data and the fact 
that most childhood malignancies are managed with combined modality therapy. 
PENTEC (Pediatric Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) is a volunteer research 
collaboration of more than 150 physicians, medical physicists, mathematical 
modellers and epidemiologists organised into 18 organ-specific working groups 
conducting a critical review and synthesis of quantitative data from existing 
studies aiming to: (1) establish quantitative, evidence-based dose/volume/risk 
guidelines to inform radiation treatment planning and, in turn, improve outcomes 
after radiation therapy for childhood cancers; (2) explore the most relevant 
risk factors for toxicity, including developmental status; (3) describe specific 
physics and dosimetric issues relevant to paediatric radiotherapy; and (4) 
propose dose-volume outcome reporting standards for publications on childhood 
cancer therapy outcomes. The impact of other critical modifiers of normal tissue 
radiation damage, including chemotherapy, surgery, stem cell transplantation and 
underlying genetic predispositions are also considered. The aims of the PENTEC 
reports are to provide clinicians with an analysis of the best available data to 
make informed decisions regarding radiation therapy normal organ dose 
constraints for planning childhood cancer treatment, and to define future 
research priorities.

Potentially avoidable hospitalisations of German nursing home patients? A 
cross-sectional study on utilisation patterns and potential consequences for 
healthcare.

Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

OBJECTIVES: Demand for nursing home (NH) care is soaring due to gains in life 
expectancy and people living longer with chronic illness and disability. This is 
dovetailing with workforce shortages across the healthcare profession. Access to 
timely and appropriate medical care for NH residents is becoming increasingly 
challenging and can result in potentially avoidable hospitalisations (PAHs). In 
light of these factors, we analysed PAHs comparing NH patients with non-NH 
patients.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with claims data from 2015 supplied by a large 
German health insurance company within the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
SETTING: One-year observation of hospitalisation patterns for NH and non-NH 
patients.
PARTICIPANTS: 3 872 245 of the 10.5million inhabitants of Baden-Wuerttemberg 
were covered.
METHODS: Patient data about hospitalisation date, sex, age, nationality, level 
of care and diagnoses were available. PAHs were defined based on international 
classification of diseases (ICD-10) diagnoses belonging to ambulatory care 
sensitive conditions (ACSCs). Adjusted ORs for PAHs for NH patients in 
comparison with non-NH patients were calculated with multivariable regression 
models.
RESULTS: Of the 933 242 hospitalisations in 2015, there were 23 982 for 13 478 
NH patients and 909 260 for 560 998 non-NH patients. Mean age of hospitalised NH 
patients and level of care were significantly higher than those of non-NH 
patients. 6449 PAHs (29.6%) for NH patients and 136 543 PAHs (15.02%) for non-NH 
patients were identified. The adjusted OR for PAHs was significantly heightened 
for NH patients in comparison with non-NH patients (OR: 1.22, CI (1.18 to 1.26), 
p<0.0001). Moreover, we could observe that more than 90% of PAHs with ACSCs were 
unplanned hospitalisations (UHs).
CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of PAHs for NH patients calls for improved 
coordination of medical care, especially general practitioner service provision. 
Introduction of targeted training programmes for physicians and NH staff on 
health problem management for NH patients could perhaps contribute to reduction 
of PAHs, predominantly UHs.

INTRODUCTION: Delayed prescribing can be a useful strategy to reduce antibiotic 
prescribing, but it is not clear for whom delayed prescribing might be 
effective. This protocol outlines an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis 
of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies to 
explore the overall effect of delayed prescribing and identify key patient 
characteristics that are associated with efficacy of delayed prescribing.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic search of the databases Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL Plus and 
Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies from inception to 
October 2017. Outcomes of interest include duration of illness, severity of 
illness, complication, reconsultation and patient satisfaction. Study authors of 
eligible papers will be contacted and invited to contribute raw IPD data. IPD 
data will be checked against published data, harmonised and aggregated to create 
one large IPD database. Multilevel regression will be performed to explore 
interaction effects between treatment allocation and patient characteristics. 
The economic evaluation will be conducted based on IPD from the combined trial 
and observational studies to estimate the differences in costs and effectiveness 
for delayed prescribing compared with normal practice. A decision model will be 
developed to assess potential savings and cost-effectiveness in terms of reduced 
antibiotic usage of delayed prescribing and quality-adjusted life years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of 
Southampton Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: 
30068). Findings of this study will be published in peer-reviewed academic 
journals as well as General Practice trade journals and will be presented at 
national and international conferences. The results will have important public 
health implications, shaping the way in which antibiotics are prescribed in the 
future and to whom delayed prescriptions are issued.

Autobiographical Life Events Reveals Linguistic Markers of Self-Positivity and 
Individual Well-Being.

Objective: Narratives of autobiographical events contain rich information about 
an individual's private experience, his/her deepest thoughts, feelings, and 
emotions. The present study investigates linguistic markers of emotion 
expression and subjective well-being in adults during one session of positive, 
negative, and neutral expressive writing. Participants (N = 28 healthy 
participants, N = 7 adults with depressive symptoms), all native speakers of 
German were instructed to write expressively about personally relevant 
autobiographical life events of negative, positive, and neutral content. 
Methods: Quantitative text analysis was performed to determine the amount of 
emotional words, first person pronouns (singular vs. plural), and cognitive 
function words used in positive, negative, and neutral narratives and to examine 
the potency of these classes of words as linguistic markers of 
positivity/negativity, self-reference, and cognitive reappraisal. Additionally, 
the relationship between expressive writing and subjective well-being was 
explored by assessing changes in self-reported psychosomatic symptoms and in 
bodily and emotional awareness immediately after positive, negative, and neutral 
writing. Results: Regarding healthy participants, negative narratives contained 
significantly more negative emotional words than positive or neutral narratives. 
However, negative narratives also contained more positive emotional words 
compared to negative emotional words in positive narratives. Moreover, negative 
narratives contained more cognitive function words than positive narratives, 
suggesting that healthy participants tried to reappraise negative experiences 
while writing about negative personal life events. Positive narratives were 
characterized by an increased use of positive words and of pronouns of the first 
person plural ("we"), supporting a positivity bias and an extension of 
self-reference from first person singular to plural (we-reference) during 
positive expressive writing. Similarly, writing about neutral events was 
characterized by a positivity bias. Although based on descriptive analysis only, 
preferential use of positive words and cognitive function words in negative 
narratives was absent in participants reporting depressive symptoms. Positive, 
negative, and neutral expressive writing was accompanied by differential changes 
in bodily sensations, emotional awareness, and self-reported psychosomatic 
symptoms in all participants. Discussion: The findings are discussed with 
respect to previous research, a self-positivity bias, and a universal positivity 
bias in language use highlighting the relevance of these biases as markers of 
subjective well-being.

Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder, is characterized by complex motor and nonmotor symptoms. The clinical 
diagnosis of PD is defined by bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, 
although several nonmotor symptoms are also related to disability, an impaired 
quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. Levodopa, which is used as a 
standard pharmacotherapy for PD, has limitations including a short half-life, 
fluctuations in efficacy, and dyskinesias with long-term use. There have been 
efforts to develop complementary and alternative therapies for incurable PD. 
Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used for 
treating neurosis, insomnia, and night crying in children. The clinical efficacy 
of YKS for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as delusions, 
hallucinations, and impaired agitation/aggression subscale and activities of 
daily living scores, has mainly been investigated in the context of neurological 
disorders such as PD, Alzheimer's disease, and other psychiatric disorders. 
Furthermore, YKS has previously been found to improve clinical symptoms, such as 
sleep disturbances, neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, pain, and 
tardive dyskinesia. Preclinical studies have reported that the broad efficacy of 
YKS for various symptoms involves its regulation of neurotransmitters including 
GABA, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as the expression of dynamin 
and glutamate transporters, and changes in glucocorticoid hormones and enzymes 
such as choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, YKS has 
neuroprotective effects at various cellular levels via diverse mechanisms. In 
this review, we focus on the clinical efficacy and neuropharmacological effects 
of YKS. We discuss the possible mechanisms underpinning the effects of YKS on 
neuropathology and suggest that the multiple actions of YKS may be beneficial as 
a treatment for PD. We highlight the potential that YKS may serve as a 
complementary and alternative strategy for the treatment of PD.

Snakebite envenomation is a life-threatening injury and a neglected public 
health issue in Africa. We report the case of a child that presented 6 days 
following a forearm snakebite with compartment syndrome and necrotizing 
fasciitis of the upper limb extending to the neck and chest who developed 
mediastinitis. She underwent multiple surgical debridements and the 
mediastinitis was managed non-surgically with antibiotics and postural drainage 
leading to recovery. The wounds were later grafted and the child discharged. 
Extension of necrotizing fasciitis from the limbs to the chest wall with 
development of mediastinitis is extremely rare with one previous case reported 
in a woman with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus on immunosuppressive 
therapy. We report this case due to its unusual presentation with no previous 
reports found on the development of mediastinitis following snakebite. In 
conclusion, physicians should have a high index of suspicion for mediastinitis 
in patients with necrotizing fasciitis extending to the neck and chest following 
snakebite.

Glioblastoma, the most common malignant tumor in the brain, lacks effective 
treatments and is currently incurable. To identify novel drug targets for this 
deadly cancer, the publicly available results of RNA interference screens from 
the Project Achilles database were analyzed. Ten candidate genes were identified 
as survival genes in 15 glioblastoma cell lines. RAN, member RAS oncogene family 
(RAN) was expressed in glioblastoma at the highest level among all candidates 
based upon cDNA microarray data. However, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not 
show any correlation between RAN mRNA levels and patient survival. Because RAN 
is a small GTPase that regulates nuclear transport controlled by karyopherin 
subunit beta 1 (KPNB1), RAN was further analyzed together with KPNB1. Indeed, 
GBM patients with high levels of RAN also had more KPNB1 and levels of KPNB1 
alone did not relate to patient prognosis. Through a Cox multivariate analysis, 
GBM patients with high levels of RAN and KPNB1 showed significantly shorter life 
expectancy when temozolomide and promoter methylation of O6-methylguanine DNA 
methyltransferase were used as covariates. These results indicate that RAN and 
KPNB1 together are associated with drug resistance and GBM poor prognosis. 
Furthermore, the functional blockade of RAN and KPNB1 by importazole remarkably 
suppressed cell viability and activated apoptosis in GBM cells expressing high 
levels of RAN, while having a limited effect on astrocytes and GBM cells with 
undetectable RAN. Together, our results demonstrate that RAN activity is 
important for GBM survival and the functional blockade of RAN/KPNB1 is an 
appealing therapeutic approach.

Lack of adequate sleep has become increasingly common in our 24/7 modern 
society. Reduced sleep has significant health consequences including metabolic 
and cardiovascular disorders, and mental problems including depression. In 
addition, although the increase in life expectancy has provided a dream of 
longevity to humans, the occurrence of osteoporosis is a big obstacle to this 
dream for both male and female. It is known that insomnia and bone health 
problems, which are very critical conditions in human life, interestingly, share 
a lot of pathogenesis in recent decades. Nevertheless, due to another side 
effects of the synthetic drugs being taken for the treatment of insomnia and 
osteoporosis, patients have substantial anxiety for the safety of drugs with 
therapeutic expectation. This review examines the pathogenesis shared by sleep 
and osteoporosis together and herbal medicine, which has recently been shown to 
be safe and efficacious in the treatment of both diseases other than synthetic 
drugs. We suggestions for how to treat osteoporosis. These efforts will be the 
first step toward enabling patients to have comfortable and safe prescriptions 
through a wide selection of therapeutic agents in the future.

BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection in 
China results in a substantial public health burden. Medical experts have not 
agreed on the best solution of population intervention for this problem. We 
presented a health economic evaluation of a population-based H pylori 
screen-and-treat strategy for preventing gastric cancer, peptic ulcer disease 
(PUD), and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were developed to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of H pylori screening followed by eradication 
treatment in asymptomatic Chinese. The modeled screen-and-treat strategy reduced 
the risk of gastric cancer, PUD, and NUD. The main outcomes were the costs, 
effectiveness, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Uncertainty was 
explored by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For preventing gastric cancer, PUD, and NUD together in a cohort of 10 
million asymptomatic Chinese at the age of 20 years, the H pylori 
screen-and-treat strategy saved 288.1 million dollars, 28 989 life years, and 
111 663 quality-adjusted life years, and prevented 11 611 gastric cancers, 5422 
deaths from gastric cancer, and 1854 deaths from PUD during life expectancy. 
Uncertainty of screening age from 20 to 60 did not affect the superiority of the 
screen-and-treat strategy over the no-screen strategy. The one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our study's 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the no-screen strategy, population-based 
screen-and-treat strategy for H pylori infection proved cheaper and more 
effective for preventing gastric cancer, PUD, and NUD in Chinese asymptomatic 
general population.

Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody neutralizing interleukin-17A, has 
been shown to have significant efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe 
psoriasis. Long-term (3-year) efficacy and safety of secukinumab in Japanese 
patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were evaluated in an extension study 
of a large phase 3 global study (SCULPTURE). In the core study, 52 Japanese 
patients with 75% improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) 
response at week 12 were re-randomized to a fixed interval (FI; every 4 weeks) 
schedule and retreatment as needed (RAN), in which patients received placebo 
until start of relapse, at which time secukinumab was reinitiated. Fifty 
Japanese patients completed the 52-week core study, and 47 patients entered the 
extension study with the same double-blind regimens up to week 152. All patients 
in the secukinumab 300 mg FI and seven patients in 150 mg FI groups completed 
3 years of treatment. PASI-90 and -100 at the end of year 3 were achieved in 
69.2% and 53.8%, respectively, in 300 mg FI and 42.9% and 42.9%, respectively, 
in 150 mg FI, indicating high sustained response in 300 mg FI. Mean absolute 
PASI was continually low in 300 mg FI and numerically higher in 150 mg FI. 
Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0/1 was maintained by approximately two-thirds 
of 300 mg FI patients, and all EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire domain 
measures were also improved. FI dosing was consistently more efficacious than 
RAN. The safety profile of secukinumab remained favorable, with no new safety 
concerns identified.

INTRODUCTION: Acute neurological illness often results in severe disability. 
Five-year life expectancy is around 40%; half the survivors become completely 
dependent on outside help.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the symptoms of patients admitted to a Hospital ward with a 
diagnosis of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage or subdural hematoma, and analyze 
the role of an In-Hospital Palliative Care Support Team.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, observational study with a sample 
consisting of all patients admitted with acute neurological illness and with a 
guidance request made to the In-Hospital Palliative Care Support Team of a 
tertiary Hospital, over 5 years (2012-2016).
RESULTS: A total of 66 patients were evaluated, with an age median of 83 years 
old. Amongst them, there were 41 ischaemic strokes, 12 intracranial bleedings, 
12 subdural hematomas, and 5 subarachnoid hemorrhages. The median of delay 
between admission and guidance request was 14 days. On the first evaluation by 
the team, the GCS score median was 6/15 and the Palliative Performance Scale 
(PPS) median 10%. Dysphagia (96.8%) and bronchorrhea (48.4%) were the most 
prevalent symptoms. A total of 56 patients had a feeding tube (84.8%), 33 had 
vital sign monitoring (50.0%), 24 were hypocoagulated (36.3%), 25 lacked opioid 
or anti-muscarinic therapy for symptom control (37,9%); 6 patients retained 
orotracheal intubation, which was removed. In-hospital mortality was 72.7% 
(n=48).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patients were severely debilitated, in many cases 
futile interventions persisted, yet several were under-medicated for symptom 
control. The delay between admission and collaboration request was high. Due to 
the high morbidity associated with acute neurological illness, palliative care 
should always be timely provided.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to estimate costs to society and 
patients' quality of life (QoL) at all levels of disease severity (measured with 
the Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS) in Brazil.
METHODS: The study was part of an international, cross-sectional 
burden-of-illness study carried out in collaboration with national MS patient 
organizations. All information was collected directly from patients using a 
validated questionnaire. Direct costs were estimated both from societal and 
payer perspectives, while total costs are presented as societal costs.
RESULTS: The survey included 694 patients (response rate 21%; mean age 40.8 
years). 95% of patients were of working age, and around half were working. The 
mean EDSS score was 3.2 (62.5% of patients with EDSS <3). Relapses were reported 
by 18.9% of patients. Fatigue affected almost all patients (94%) regardless of 
EDSS level, and cognitive difficulties were reported by 69.1% of patients. Mean 
utility ranged from 0.77 at EDSS 0 to negative values at EDSS 9, with a mean 
score of 0.58; utility was affected by relapses. Total mean annual cost was 
R$33,872 (€ 8,000) per patient in the societal perspective, with direct costs 
representing 81% (R$ 27,355, € 6,500). Direct costs for the payer amounted to R$ 
16,793 (€ 4,000)/patient.
CONCLUSIONS: This study included a population with relatively mild and early 
disease, with a majority of patients with relapsing disease and thus on DMD 
treatment. It is not possible to conclude directly on the total cost of MS in 
Brazil. Nevertheless, resource quantities used, QoL and MS symptoms are very 
similar to what was seen in the European survey.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) 
compared with no NSPs on hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in the United 
Kingdom.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a National Health Service 
(NHS)/health-provider perspective, utilizing a dynamic transmission model of HCV 
infection and disease progression, calibrated using city-specific surveillance 
and survey data, and primary data collection on NSP costs. The effectiveness of 
NSPs preventing HCV acquisition was based on empirical evidence.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: UK settings with different chronic HCV prevalence 
among people who inject drugs (PWID): Dundee (26%), Walsall (18%) and Bristol 
(45%) INTERVENTIONS: Current NSP provision is compared with a counterfactual 
scenario where NSPs are removed for 10 years and then returned to existing 
levels with effects collected for 40 years.
MEASUREMENTS: HCV infections and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained through NSPs over 50 years.
FINDINGS: Compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY 
gained, NSPs were highly cost-effective over a time-horizon of 50 years and 
decreased the number of HCV incident infections. The mean incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was cost-saving in Dundee and Bristol, and £596 per 
QALY gained in Walsall, with 78, 46 and 40% of simulations being cost-saving in 
each city, respectively, with differences driven by coverage of NSP and HCV 
prevalence (lowest in Walsall). More than 90% of simulations were cost-effective 
at the willingness-to-pay threshold. Results were robust to sensitivity 
analyses, including varying the time-horizon, HCV treatment cost and numbers of 
HCV treatments per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Needle and syringe programmes are a highly effective low-cost 
intervention to reduce hepatitis C virus transmission, and in some settings they 
are cost-saving. Needle and syringe programmes are likely to remain 
cost-effective irrespective of changes in hepatitis C virus treatment cost and 
scale-up.

Relative survival methods used to estimate the excess mortality of cancer 
patients rely on the background (or expected) mortality derived from general 
population life tables. These methods are based on splitting the observed 
mortality into the excess mortality and the background mortality. By assuming a 
regression model for the excess mortality, usually a Cox-type model, one may 
investigate the effects of certain covariates on the excess mortality. Some 
covariates are cancer-specific whereas others are variables that may influence 
the background mortality as well. The latter should be taken into account in the 
background mortality to avoid biases in estimating their effects on the excess 
mortality. Unfortunately, the available life table might not include such 
variables and, consequently, might provide inaccurate values of the background 
mortality. We propose a model that uses multiplicative parameters to correct 
potentially inaccurate background mortality. The model can be seen as an 
extension of the frequently used Estève model because we assume a Cox-type model 
for the excess mortality with a piecewise constant baseline function and 
introduce additional parameters that multiply the background mortality. The 
original and the extended model are compared, first in a simulation study, then 
in an application to colon cancer registry data.

The discovery of new biomarkers associated with cancer, neurological and 
cardiovascular diseases is necessary, since these are common, recurrent diseases 
considered as leading causes of death in the human population. Molecular 
signatures of these disorders that can be identified at the outset of their 
pathogenesis leading to prompt and targeted treatment may increase patient 
survival. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be expressed differently 
among individuals; in addition, treatments may have a differentiated approach 
according to the type of malignant neoplasm. Thus, these neoplastic cells can 
synthesize and release specific molecules depending on the site where 
carcinogenesis begins. Moreover, life expectancy is increasing especially in 
developed countries, however, cases of neurodegenerative diseases have grown in 
the older members of the population. Commonly, some neurological disorders, 
which can occur physiologically by the process of senescence, are confused with 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In addition, cardiovascular diseases are the main 
cause of death in the world; studies capable of identifying, through molecular 
probes, the beginning of development of an atherosclerotic process can lead to 
early treatment to avoid an acute myocardial infarction. Accuracy in the 
detection of these biomarkers can be obtained through biosensors whose design 
has been increasingly studied to elaborate inexpensive sensory platforms capable 
of precise detection, even at low concentrations, of the molecule to be 
measured. The aim of this review is to address biomarkers to be used in 
diagnoses instead of invasive exams; biosensors for the specific and sensitive 
detection of these biological markers are also investigated.

PURPOSE: To validate the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS) Global-10 for patients who have lateral epicondylitis requiring 
surgical treatment in comparison with other gold standard patient-reported 
outcomes.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients with lateral epicondylitis of the elbow were 
prospectively enrolled before arthroscopic treatment. Inclusion criteria were 
patients 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis. 
Each patient completed the PROMIS Global-10, EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D), 
American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) assessment form, Mayo Elbow 
Performance Score (MEPS), and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
Score (QuickDASH). Spearman correlations were calculated. Bland-Altman agreement 
tests were conducted between estimated EQ-5D scores from the PROMIS-10 and 
actual EQ-5D scores.
RESULTS: Correlation between the PROMIS-10 and the EQ-5D was excellent (0.72, P 
< .0001). Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement for estimated EQ-5D scores ranged 
from 0.33 below to 0.21 above actual EQ-5D scores. Correlation of the PROMIS-10 
physical score was good to excellent with MEPS (0.61, P < .0001) and QuickDASH 
scores (0.64, P < .0001) and good with the ASES (0.58, P < .0001). Correlation 
of the PROMIS mental scores was good with QuickDASH (0.50, P < .0001) and poor 
with ASES (0.26, P = .0492) and MEPS (0.37, P = .0038).
CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS Global-10 physical scores showed good to excellent 
correlation with gold standard patient-reported outcome instruments, 
demonstrating it is a reliable tool for outcome assessment in populations with 
lateral epicondylitis. Despite the excellent correlation with the EQ-5D, the 95% 
limit of agreement and high variability among the estimated EQ-5D scores derived 
from the PROMIS-10 suggests that the PROMIS-10 cannot be used as a substitute 
for actual EQ-5D scores to derive quality-adjusted life years for economic 
evaluations and cost-effectiveness research.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, development of diagnostic criteria on the basis of 
consecutive patients.

Omega-3 for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children.

Clerc P, Mouzaki M, Goldman RD.

Question An overweight 12-year-old male patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease has had little improvement in liver steatosis or triglyceride levels 
over the past 2 years. Is omega-3 supplementation useful in managing his 
condition?Answer Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children is prevalent in 
the Canadian population and can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, transplant, 
and reduced life expectancy. There is no recommended pharmacologic treatment of 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are associated with small 
improvements in liver steatosis and triglyceride concentrations. There are 
conflicting results with regard to liver function test results and insulin 
resistance, and while there might be histologic improvement revealed on biopsy, 
there is little evidence that fibrosis is improved. In children who have 
struggled to be consistent with the changes needed in their diet, particularly 
those with elevated triglyceride levels, there might be a role for omega-3 
supplementation while continuing to focus on the mainstays of treatment (diet 
and physical activity); however, further research is still needed.

Question Chez un garçon obèse de 12 ans atteint de la maladie du foie gras non 
alcoolique, peu d’améliorations ont été observées dans sa stéatose hépatique ou 
dans ses taux de triglycérides au cours des 2 dernières années. Un supplément 
d’oméga-3 serait-il utile dans la prise en charge de son problème? Réponse La 
stéatose hépatique non alcoolique chez les enfants est répandue dans la 
population canadienne. Elle peut entraîner une fibrose, une cirrhose et une 
greffe du foie, de même que réduire l’espérance de vie. Aucune pharmacothérapie 
n’est recommandée pour le traitement de la maladie du foie gras non alcoolique. 
Les acides gras oméga-3 sont associés à de légères améliorations dans la 
stéatose hépatique et les concentrations de triglycérides. Les résultats sont 
contradictoires en ce qui concerne les tests de la fonction hépatique et de la 
résistance à l’insuline et, si des améliorations histologiques peuvent être 
constatées à la suite d’une biopsie, il y a peu de données prouvant que la 
fibrose est améliorée. Chez les enfants qui ont éprouvé des difficultés à 
maintenir les changements nécessaires à leur alimentation, en particulier ceux 
dont les niveaux de triglycérides sont élevés, un supplément d’oméga-3 pourrait 
être utile, tout en continuant à se concentrer sur les éléments principaux du 
traitement (régime et activité physique); par ailleurs, des recherches plus 
approfondies sont encore nécessaires.
