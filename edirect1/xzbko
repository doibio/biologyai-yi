is a rare low- to moderate-level tumor occurring in the lungs with 
differentiation toward vascular endothelial cells. Clinically, it is difficult 
to distinguish from a variety of other benign and malignant lung diseases. For 
diagnosis, a distinction must be made from other diseases such as chronic 
granulomatous disease, amyloid nodules, hamartoma, primary and metastatic lung 
cancers, malignant mesothelioma and vascular sarcoma. In the present study, the 
clinicopathological features of four cases of PEH were investigated and the 
associated literature was reviewed. The results of this study may improve 
understanding with regards to the diagnosis and therapeutic options for patients 
with PEH.

Cost-effectiveness of allopurinol and febuxostat for the management of gout.

Jutkowitz E, Choi HK, Pizzi LT, Kuntz KM.

BACKGROUND: Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of urate-lowering treatment 
strategies for the management of gout.
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature and expert opinion.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients for whom allopurinol or febuxostat is a suitable 
initial urate-lowering treatment.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care payer.
INTERVENTION: 5 urate-lowering treatment strategies were evaluated: no 
treatment; allopurinol- or febuxostat-only therapy; allopurinol-febuxostat 
sequential therapy; and febuxostat-allopurinol sequential therapy. Two dosing 
scenarios were investigated: fixed dose (80 mg of febuxostat daily, 0.80 success 
rate; 300 mg of allopurinol daily, 0.39 success rate) and dose escalation (≤120 
mg of febuxostat daily, 0.82 success rate; ≤800 mg of allopurinol daily, 0.78 
success rate).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In both dosing scenarios, allopurinol-only 
therapy was cost-saving. Dose-escalation allopurinol-febuxostat sequential 
therapy was more costly but more effective than dose-escalation allopurinol 
therapy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $39 400 per 
quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The relative rankings of treatments did not 
change. Our results were relatively sensitive to several potential variations of 
model assumptions; however, the cost-effectiveness ratios of dose escalation 
with allopurinol-febuxostat sequential therapy remained lower than the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $109 000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
LIMITATION: Long-term outcome data for patients with gout, including medication 
adherence, are limited.
CONCLUSION: Allopurinol single therapy is cost-saving compared with no 
treatment. Dose-escalation allopurinol-febuxostat sequential therapy is 
cost-effective compared with accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.

The labellum in orchids shares homology with the inner lateral petals of the 
flower. The labellum is a modified petal and often distinguished from other 
petals and sepals due to its large size and irregular shape. Herein, we combined 
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) approaches 
to identify the differentially expressed proteome between labellum and inner 
lateral petal in one of Orchid species (C. ensifolium). A total of 30 protein 
spots were identified, which showed more than a two-fold significant difference 
(p<0.05) in their expression. Compared with C. ensifolium transcriptome 
(sequenced in house), 21 proteins matched the translated nucleotide. The 
proteins identified were classified into 48 categories according to gene 
ontology (GO). Additionally, these proteins were involved in 18 pathways and 9 
possible protein-protein interactions. Serine carboxypeptidase and 
beta-glucosidase were involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which could 
regulate biosynthesis of floral scent components. Malate dehydrogenase (maeB) 
and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) in carbon fixation pathway could regulate 
the energy metabolism. Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XET/XTH) could 
promote cell wall formation and aid the petal's morphogenesis. The 
identification of such differentially expressed proteins provides new targets 
for future studies; these will assess the proteins' physiological roles and 
significance in labellum and inner lateral petals.

Outcomes from the Northern Territory Audit of Surgical Mortality: Aboriginal 
deaths.

Treacy PJ(1), North JB, Rey-Conde T, Allen J, Ware RS.

Author information:

Territory, Australia.

BACKGROUND: A significant 'gap' in life expectancy exists for Australian 
Aboriginal people. The role of surgical care in this gap has been poorly 
addressed. This study has compared in-hospital surgical deaths of Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal persons in order to identify patient factors plus deficiencies of 
care that may have contributed to the gap.
METHODS: This study used retrospective data collection and prospective audit of 
all in-hospital surgical deaths since commencement of the Northern Territory 
Audit of Surgical Mortality (NTASM). Outcome measures included causes of death, 
coexisting factors and deficiencies of care.
RESULTS: Between June 2010 and June 2013, 190 deaths were audited (96% capture), 
of which 72 (38%) were Aboriginal. Aboriginal persons were younger at death (53 
versus 65 years, P < 0.001) and had a higher incidence of diabetes (odds ratio = 
2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-5.6), renal (2.3, 1.1-4.7) and liver disease 
(5.7, 2.6-12.9). When adjusted for age and gender, serious cofactors were 
significantly more common in Aboriginal persons (3.8, 1.3-7.1). Rates of 
infections and all-cause trauma were comparable. There were no significant 
differences in the rates of complications, unplanned returns to theatre or 
intensive care unit, delays to surgery or whether in retrospect the surgeon 
considered management overall could have been improved.
CONCLUSIONS: A large gap of 12 years exists for age at death between Aboriginal 
and non-Aboriginal persons admitted as surgical patients in the Northern 
Territory. Aboriginal persons had significantly more co-morbidities at time of 
death, particularly diabetes, renal and hepatic disease. No significant 
discrepancies of surgical care were identified between Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal persons.

We treated a 54-year-old Japanese female with a recurrent radiation-induced 
osteosarcoma arising from left occipital skull, by reactor-based boron neutron 
capture therapy (BNCT). Her tumor grew rapidly with subcutaneous and epidural 
extension. She eventually could not walk because of cerebellar ataxia. The tumor 
was inoperable and radioresistant. BNCT showed a marked initial therapeutic 
effect: the subcutaneous/epidural tumor reduced without radiation damage of the 
scalp except hair loss and the patient could walk again only 3 weeks after BNCT. 
BNCT seems to be a safe and very effective modality in the management of 
radiation-induced osteosarcomas that are not eligible for operation and other 
treatment modalities.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is costly. Current guidelines recommend 
metronidazole as first-line therapy and vancomycin as an alternative. Recurrence 
is common. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for 
recurrent CDI (RCDI). This study explores the cost-effectiveness of FMT, 
vancomycin and metronidazole for initial CDI. We constructed a decision-analytic 
computer simulation using inputs from published literature to compare FMT with a 
10-14-day course of oral metronidazole or vancomycin for initial CDI. Parameters 
included cure rates (baseline value (range)) for metronidazole (80% (65-85%)), 
vancomycin (90% (88-92%)) and FMT(91% (83-100%)). Direct costs of metronidazole, 
vancomycin and FMT, adjusted to 2011 dollars, were $57 ($43-72), $1347 
($1195-1499) and $1086 ($815-1358), respectively. Our effectiveness measure was 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted from the third-party payer perspective. Analysis using 
baseline values showed that FMT($1669, 0.242 QALYs) dominated (i.e. was less 
costly and more effective) vancomycin ($1890, 0.241 QALYs). FMT was more costly 
and more effective than metronidazole ($1167, 0.238 QALYs), yielding an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $124 964/QALY. One-way 
sensitivity analyses showed that metronidazole dominated both strategies if its 
probability of cure were >90%; FMT dominated if it cost <$584. In a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100 000/QALY, metronidazole was favoured in 55% of model iterations; FMT was 
favoured in 38%. Metronidazole, as the first-line treatment for CDIs, is less 
costly. FMT and vancomycin are more effective. However, FMT is less likely to be 
economically favourable, and vancomycin is unlikely to be favourable as 
first-line therapy when compared with FMT.

progenitor cells from neonatal rat brain.

Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS). 
The isolation of purified oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in large 
numbers has been sought after as a source of cells for repair following 
CNS-demyelinating diseases and injuries, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods for isolation of OPCs from rodent neonatal 
brains are well established and have formed the basis for research in myelin 
repair within the CNS for many years. However, long-term maintenance of OPCs has 
been a challenge owing to small cellular yields per animal and spontaneous 
differentiation within a short period of time. Much effort has been devoted to 
achieving long-term culture and maintenance of OPCs, but little progress has 
been made. Here, protocols are presented for preparation of highly enriched rat 
OPC populations and for their long-term maintenance as oligospheres using 
mixed-glial-conditioned medium. Functional myelinating oligodendrocytes can be 
achieved from such protocols, when co-cultured with primary neurons. This 
approach is an extension of our normal shaking method for isolating OPCs, and 
incorporates some adaptations from previous OPC culture methods.

Mirror therapy combined with biofeedback functional electrical stimulation for 
motor recovery of upper extremities after stroke: a pilot randomized controlled 
trial.

Korea; Department of Adult Physical Therapy, Seoul Rehabilitation Hospital, 
Seoul, Republic of Korea.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of mirror therapy in 
combination with biofeedback functional electrical stimulation (BF-FES) on motor 
recovery of the upper extremities after stroke. Twenty-nine patients who 
suffered a stroke > 6 months prior participated in this study and were randomly 
allocated to three groups. The BF-FES + mirror therapy and FES + mirror therapy 
groups practiced training for 5 × 30 min sessions over a 4-week period. The 
control group received a conventional physical therapy program. The following 
clinical tools were used to assess motor recovery of the upper extremities: 
electrical muscle tester, electrogoniometer, dual-inclinometer, 
electrodynamometer, the Box and Block Test (BBT) and Jabsen Taylor Hand Function 
Test (JHFT), the Functional Independence Measure, the Modified Ashworth Scale, 
and the Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQOL) assessment. The BF-FES + mirror 
therapy group showed significant improvement in wrist extension as revealed by 
the Manual Muscle Test and Range of Motion (p < 0.05). The BF-FES + mirror 
therapy group showed significant improvement in the BBT, JTHT, and SSQOL 
compared with the FES + mirror therapy group and control group (p < 0.05). We 
found that BF-FES + mirror therapy induced motor recovery and improved quality 
of life. These results suggest that mirror therapy, in combination with BF-FES, 
is feasible and effective for motor recovery of the upper extremities after 
stroke.

OBJECTIVES: Safety and efficacy data for catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) 
in the treatment of resistant hypertension have been used to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of this approach. However, there are no Dutch-specific 
analyses. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of RDN from the perspective 
of the healthcare payer in The Netherlands.
METHODS: A previously constructed Markov state-transition model was adapted and 
updated with costs and utilities relevant to the Dutch setting. The 
cost-effectiveness of RDN was compared with standard of care (SoC) for patients 
with resistant hypertension. The efficacy of RDN treatment was modeled as a 
reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events associated with a lower systolic 
blood pressure (SBP).
RESULTS: Treatment with RDN compared to SoC gave an incremental quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gain of 0.89 at an additional cost of €1315 over a patient's 
lifetime, resulting in a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of €1474. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) showed that 
treatment with RDN therapy was cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay 
thresholds (€10,000-80,000/QALY).
CONCLUSION: RDN is a cost-effective intervention for patients with resistant 
hypertension in The Netherlands.

Why closing the Aboriginal health gap is so elusive.

Gracey M(1).

Author information:
(1)Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

A wide gap persists between the health of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal 
Australians despite a recent Federal government commitment to close the gap by 
2030. The complex underlying factors include socioeconomic and environmental 
disadvantage, inadequate education, underemployment, racial prejudice, high-risk 
health-related behaviours and limited access to clinical services and health 
promotion programmes. Over recent decades some aspects of Aboriginal health have 
deteriorated badly, largely from a surge in chronic 'lifestyle' diseases like 
diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disorders plus the effects of tobacco 
smoking, alcohol and drug abuse and high rates of violence and trauma. To 
correct these inequities will require improving many social and environmental 
factors. These include education, living conditions, vocational training, 
employment, closer cooperation between government and non-government agencies, 
access to affordable and nutritious fresh food, with better access to 
high-quality medical treatment, health promotion and disease prevention 
programmes. Indigenous people must be encouraged to become more involved in 
activities to improve their health and have more responsibility for the 
decision-making processes this will entail. Governments must support these 
changes to help close the Aboriginal health gap.

Usefulness of Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy using Talaporfin Sodium for an 
Advanced-aged Patient with Inoperable Gastric Cancer (a secondary publication).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Japan the rise in the average life expectancy has caused 
an increase in the proportion of the population who are classed as geriatric. 
Accordingly, the number of elderly people being treated for cancer is increasing 
concomitantly. However, with the increase in age, the numbers of prior 
complications also increase. This is especially so in the advanced-aged 
patients, defined in Japan as those over the age of 85. Such complications may 
be too high risk for radical surgery and a less invasive treatment is warranted. 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive treatment approved by the Japanese 
National Health Insurance for the treatment of early stage superficial type 
esophageal and gastric cancers, early stage uterine cervical cancers and 
dysplasia, and early and advanced lung cancer. We report herein on the efficacy 
of palliative PDT using talaporfin sodium (Laserphyrin(®)) for a case of 
inoperable gastric cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patient was an 87-year-old-man, a diabetic with 
histories of diabetic nephropathy, cerebral infarction and myocardial 
infarction. This patient was first diagnosed as having gastric cancer in 2007 
but surgery and chemotherapy were contraindicated due to his poor physical 
status and poor renal function, respectively, owing to the anticipated side 
effects. The patient was referred to our institution after hearing of PDT in 
2009. He was treated with 1 course of porfimer sodium PDT and 3 courses of 
talaporfin sodium PDT with photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) during the period from 
September, 2009 to June, 2011.
RESULTS: The massive gastric cancer located in the cardia was successfully 
treated with 4 PDT sessions without any serious complications; therefore the 
patient was able to orally ingest food until his death due to natural causes 
other than the cancer, in October, 2011.
CONCLUSION: Talaporfin sodium PDT is safe and effective treatment for 
advanced-aged patients suffering from inoperable gastric cancer.

State, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: The demographic transition and increasing life expectancy in Africa 
has lead to a rising elderly population. In Nigeria, little is known about the 
profile of and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) in the elderly.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adult TB patients treated between January 
2011 and December 2012 in two large health facilities in Nigeria. The 
demographic, clinical and treatment outcomes of patients aged 60 and older were 
compared with those aged 15 to 59 years.
RESULTS: Elderly (≥ 60 years) TB patients accounted for 12.7% of all (1668) 
adult TB enrolled. Elderly patients had a higher proportion of men compared to 
non-elderly (64.2% vs 56.8%; p = 0.043); but a lower proportion of 
smear-positive TB at baseline (40.7% vs 65.8%; p<0.001). A higher proportion of 
elderly patients failed to smear convert after the intensive phase of treatment 
(23.7% vs 19.8%; p = 0.06), and overall elderly patients had lower treatment 
success rates (68.9% vs 77.1%; p = 0.009). Unsuccessful outcomes were mainly due 
to higher default and deaths in the elderly. The risk factors for unsuccessful 
outcomes in the elderly were: extrapulmonary TB case (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 
10.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-108), and HIV co-infection (aOR 3.6; CI 
1.1-11.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment outcomes of elderly TB patients were inferior to 
non-elderly adults with higher death and default rates being implicated. With 
the rising elderly population, specific strategies are needed to quickly address 
TB management in the elderly in resource-limited settings.

Therapy preferences in melanoma treatment--willingness to pay and preference of 
quality versus length of life of patients, physicians and healthy controls.

BACKGROUND: New melanoma therapies, like e.g. ipilimumab, improve survival. 
However, only a small subset of patients benefits while 60% encounter side 
effects. Furthermore, these marginal benefits come at a very high price of 
€110'000 per treatment. This study examines attitudes towards melanoma therapy 
options of physicians, healthy individuals and patients, their willingness to 
pay and preference of quality versus length of life.
METHODS: Based on findings from a focus group questionnaires were developed and 
pretested. After obtaining ethical approval and informed consent surveys were 
conducted in a total of 90 participants (n = 30 for each group). Statistical 
analyses were conducted using R.
FINDINGS: Attitudes vastly differed between healthy participants, physicians and 
melanoma patients. Whereas melanoma patients show a high willingness to endure 
side effects despite very small survival gains (down to 1 extra week) or even 
only hope with no survival benefit, healthy controls are more critical, while 
physicians are the most therapy adverse. Consequently, if given €100'000 and the 
free decision what to spend the money on the willingness to pay for therapy was 
much higher in the patient group (68%) compared to 28% of healthy controls and 
only 43% of the physicians, respectively. When lowering the amount of cash that 
could be received instead of ipilimumab to €50'000 or €10'000 to test price 
sensitivity 69% (+1%) and 76% (+8%) of melanoma patients, respectively, 
preferred ipilimumab over cash. When judging on societal spending even melanoma 
patients opted for spending on ipilimumab in only 21%.
CONCLUSION: The judgment about the benefits of new treatment options largely 
differs between groups, physicians being the most critical against therapy. 
Price elasticity was low.

BACKGROUND: Allocation of health research funds among diseases has never been 
evaluated in China. This study aimed to examine the relationship between 
disease-specific funding levels of National Nature Science Foundation of China 
(NSFC), the main governmental resource for health research in China, and burden 
of disease.
METHODS: Funding magnitudes for 53 diseases or conditions were obtained from the 
website of NSFC. Measures of disease burden, mortality, years of life lost 
(YLLs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), were derived from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2010. The relationship between NSFC funding and disease 
burden was analyzed with univariate linear regression. For each measure 
associated with funding, regression-derived estimates were used to calculate the 
expected funds for each disease. The actual and expected funds were then 
compared. We also evaluated the impacts of changes of disease burden metrics 
since 1990, and differences from the world averages on NSFC funding.
RESULTS: NSFC health research funding was associated with disease burden 
measured in mortality (R = 0.33, P = 0.02), YLLs (R = 0.39, P = 0.004), and 
DALYs (R  = 0.40, P = 0.003). But none of the changes of mortality (R = 0.22, P 
= 0.12), YLLs (R =  -0.04, P = 0.79) and DALYs (R =  -0.003, P = 0.98) since 
1990 was associated with the funding magnitudes. None of the differences of 
mortality (R =  -0.11, P = 0.45), YLLs (R =  -0.11, P = 0.43) and DALYs (R = 
 -0.12, P = 0.38) from that of the concurrent world averages were associated 
with the funding magnitudes. Measured by DALY, stroke and COPD received the 
least funding compared to expected; while leukemia and diabetes received the 
most funding compared to expected.
CONCLUSION: Although NSFC funding were roughly associated with disease burden as 
measured in mortality, YLLs and DALYs. Some major diseases such as stroke were 
underfunded; while others such as leukaemia were overfunded. Change of disease 
burden during the last 20 years and country-specialized disease burden were not 
reflected in current allocation of NSFC funds.

The aim of our study was to relate four modifiable lifestyle factors (smoking 
status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) to health expectancy, using 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a prospective cohort study. Data of the 
prospective EPIC-NL study were used, including 33,066 healthy men and women aged 
20-70 years at baseline (1993-7), followed until 31-12-2007 for occurrence of 
disease and death. Smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and 
adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (excluding alcohol) were investigated 
separately and combined into a healthy lifestyle score, ranging from 0 to 4. 
QALYs were used as summary measure of healthy life expectancy, combining a 
person's life expectancy with a weight for quality of life when having a chronic 
disease. For lifestyle factors analyzed separately the number of years living 
longer in good health varied from 0.12 year to 0.84 year, after adjusting for 
covariates. A combination of the four lifestyle factors was positively 
associated with higher QALYs (P-trend <0.0001). A healthy lifestyle score of 4 
compared to a score of 0 was associated with almost a 2 years longer life in 
good health (1.75 QALYs [95% CI 1.37, 2.14]).

The identification of a hot spot of exceptional longevity, the Longevity Blue 
Zone (LBZ), in the mountain population of Sardinia has aroused considerable 
interest toward its traditional food as one of the potential causal factors. 
This preliminary study on the traditional Sardinian diet has been supported by 
the literature available, which has been carefully reviewed and compared. Up to 
a short time ago, the LBZ population depended mostly upon livestock rearing, and 
consumption of animal-derived foods was relatively higher than in the rest of 
the island. The nutrition transition (NT) in urbanized and lowland areas began 
in the mid-1950s, fueled by economic development, whereas in the LBZ it started 
later owing to prolonged resistance to change by a society organized around a 
rather efficient pastoral economy. Even nowadays a large proportion of the 
population in this area still follows the traditional diet based on 
cereal-derived foods and dairy products. The LBZ cohorts comprising individuals 
who were of a mature age when NT began may have benefited both from the 
high-quality, albeit rather monotonous, traditional diet to which they had been 
exposed most of their life and from the transitional diet, which introduced 
positive changes such as more variety, increased consumption of fruits and 
vegetables and moderate meat intake. It could be speculated that these changes 
may have brought substantial health benefits to this particular aging group, 
which was in need of nutrient-rich food at this specific time in life, thereby 
resulting in a decreased mortality risk and, in turn, life-span extension.

Social capital, mortality, cardiovascular events and cancer: a systematic review 
of prospective studies.

GD, Ebrahim S, Dale C, Casas JP.

BACKGROUND: Social capital is considered to be an important determinant of life 
expectancy and cardiovascular health. Evidence on the association between social 
capital and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer was 
systematically reviewed.
METHODS: Prospective studies examining the association of social capital with 
these outcomes were systematically sought in Medline, Embase and PsycInfo, all 
from inception to 8 October 2012. We categorized the findings from studies 
according to seven dimensions of social capital, including social participation, 
social network, civic participation,social support, trust, norm of reciprocity 
and sense of community, and pooled the estimates across studies to obtain 
summary relative risks of the health outcomes for each social capital dimension. 
We excluded studies focusing on children, refugees or immigrants and studies 
conducted in the former Soviet Union.
RESULTS: Fourteen prospective studies were identified. The pooled estimates 
showed no association between most social capital dimensions and all-cause 
mortality, CVD or cancer. Limited evidence was found for association of 
increased mortality with social participation and civic participation when 
comparing the most extreme risk comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence to support an association between social capital and 
health outcomes is limited. Lack of consensus on measurements for social capital 
hinders the comparability of studies and weakens the evidence base.

The ability to maintain the body relative to the external environment is 
important for adaptation to altered gravity. However, the physiological limits 
for adaptation or the disruption of body orientation are not known. In this 
study, we analyzed postural changes in mice upon exposure to various low 
gravities. Male C57BL6/J mice (n = 6) were exposed to various 
gravity-deceleration conditions by customized parabolic flight-maneuvers 
targeting the partial-gravity levels of 0.60, 0.30, 0.15 and μ g (<0.001 g). 
Video recordings of postural responses were analyzed frame-by-frame by 
high-definition cineradiography and with exact instantaneous values of gravity 
and jerk. As a result, the coordinated extension of the neck, spine and 
hindlimbs was observed during the initial phase of gravity deceleration. Joint 
angles widened to 120%-200% of the reference g level, and the magnitude of the 
thoracic-curvature stretching was correlated with gravity and jerk, i.e., the 
gravity deceleration rate. A certain range of jerk facilitated mouse skeletal 
stretching efficiently, and a jerk of -0.3~-0.4 j (g/s) induced the maximum 
extension of the thoracic-curvature. The postural response of animals to low 
gravity may undergo differential regulation by gravity and jerk.

The study was to compare treatment preference, efficacy, and tolerability of 
sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) and tadalafil for treating erectile dysfunction 
(ED) in Chinese men naοve to phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor therapies. 
This multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study evaluated whether 
Chinese men with ED preferred 20-mg tadalafil or 100-mg sildenafil. After a 4 
weeks baseline assessment, 383 eligible patients were randomized to sequential 
20-mg tadalafil per 100-mg sildenafil or vice versa for 8 weeks respectively and 
then chose which treatment they preferred to take during the 8 weeks extension. 
Primary efficacy was measured by Question 1 of the PDE5 Inhibitor Treatment 
Preference Questionnaire (PITPQ). Secondary efficacy was analyzed by PITPQ 
Question 2, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) erectile 
function (EF) domain, sexual encounter profile (SEP) Questions 2 and 3, and the 
Drug Attributes Questionnaire. Three hundred and fifty men (91%) completed the 
randomized treatment phase. Two hundred and forty-two per 350 (69.1%) patients 
preferred 20-mg tadalafil, and 108/350 (30.9%) preferred 100-mg sildenafil (P < 
0.001) as their treatment in the 8 weeks extension. Ninety-two per 242 (38%) 
patients strongly preferred tadalafil and 37/108 (34.3%) strongly the preferred 
sildenafil. The SEP2 (penetration), SEP3 (successful intercourse), and IIEF-EF 
domain scores were improved in both tadalafil and sildenafil treatment groups. 
For patients who preferred tadalafil, getting an erection long after taking the 
medication was the most reported reason for tadalafil preference. The only 
treatment-emergent adverse event reported by > 2% of men was headache. After 
tadalafil and sildenafil treatments, more Chinese men with ED naοve to PDE5 
inhibitor preferred tadalafil. Both sildenafil and tadalafil treatments were 
effective and safe.

Explanation of the emergence of primitive cellular structures from a set of 
chemical reactions is necessary to unveil the origin of life and to 
experimentally synthesize protocells. By simulating a cellular automaton model 
with a two-species hypercycle, we demonstrate the reproduction of a localized 
cluster; that is, a protocell with a growth-division process emerges when the 
replication and degradation speeds of one species are respectively slower than 
those of the other species, because of overcrowding of molecules as a natural 
outcome of the replication. The protocell exhibits synchrony between its 
division process and replication of the minority molecule. We discuss the 
effects of the crowding molecule on the formation of primitive structures. The 
generality of this result is demonstrated through the extension of our model to 
a hypercycle with three molecular species, where a localized layered structure 
of molecules continues to divide, triggered by the replication of a minority 
molecule at the center.

Hematology, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.

The initial treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CP-CML) 
represents a complex process, which includes a prompt and precise diagnosis, the 
choice among three available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and the initial 
management of care for these patients, which will protract over a very long 
period of time. This manuscript summarizes different data on activity, side 
effects, and supportive measures available for each TKI, the need for particular 
care in the logistical organization of CML management, the scenario which will 
be opened by the future availability of generic imatinib. The opinion of the 
authors is that imatinib remains the first-line treatment for CP-CML; this 
strategy, accompanied by intensive monitoring and possible dose 
modification/drug switch after the initial 3-12 months of treatment presently 
assures a normal life expectancy to the population of newly diagnosed patients 
with CP-CML.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to pilot a community pharmacy chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) case finding service in England, estimating costs and 
effects.
METHODS: Patients potentially at risk of COPD were screened with validated 
tools. Smoking cessation was offered to all smokers identified as potentially 
having undiagnosed COPD. Cost and effects of the service were estimated.
KEY FINDINGS: Twenty-one community pharmacies screened 238 patients over 9 
months. One hundred thirty-five patients were identified with potentially 
undiagnosed COPD; 88 were smokers. Smoking cessation initiation provided a 
project gain of 38.62 life years, 19.92 quality-adjusted life years and a cost 
saving of £392.67 per patient screened.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD case finding by community pharmacists potentially provides 
cost-savings and improves quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the morbidities from delivery at earlier gestational ages 
versus intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) for women with intrahepatic cholestasis 
of pregnancy (ICP) to determine the optimal gestational age for delivery.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created to compare delivery at 35 through 
38 weeks gestation for different delivery strategies: (1) empiric steroids; (2) 
steroids if fetal lung maturity (FLM) negative; (3) wait a week and retest if 
FLM negative; or (4) deliver immediately. Literature review identified 18 
studies that estimated IUFD in ICP; we used the mean rate, 1.74%, and assumed a 
uniform distribution from 34 to 40 weeks gestation. Large cohort data was used 
to calculate neonatal morbidity rates at each gestational age. Maternal and 
neonatal quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were combined. Univariate 
sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses were performed to test for robustness.
RESULTS: Immediate delivery at 36 weeks without FLM testing and steroid 
administration was the optimal strategy as compared to delivery at 36 weeks with 
steroids (+47 QALYs) and as compared to immediate delivery at 35 weeks (+210 
QALYs). Our results were robust up to a 30% increase in the rate of IUFD.
CONCLUSION: Immediate delivery at 36 weeks in women with ICP is the optimal 
delivery strategy.

Dietary supplements in the management of hypertension and diabetes - a review.

Afolayan AJ(1), Wintola OA(1).

Author information:
(1)Medicinal Plant and Economic Development Research Centre, Department of 
Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa.

BACKGROUND: The use of alternative therapies like herbs and dietary supplements 
is very common among hypertensive and diabetic patients all over the globe. 
Hypertension is a silent disease that causes increase in cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, renal morbidity and mortality whereas diabetic complications 
cause heart attack, stroke, blindness and kidney disease. These are serious and 
chronic metabolic disorders that have a significant impact on the health, 
quality of life, and life expectancy of patients, as well as on the health care 
systems. Orthodox drugs used for the treatment of hypertension and diabetes 
produce side effects such as headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, 
constipation, diarrhea, weakness, fatigue and erectile dysfunction. The need for 
considering alternate therapies in the form of dietary supplements known to 
promote good health, having little or no side effects therefore arises.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was carried out using comprehensive and 
systematic literature reports on the concurrent use of dietary supplements in 
the management of diabetes and hypertension. Empirical searches were conducted 
using Google scholar (http://scholar.google.com), and Science Direct 
(http://www.sciencedirect.com). In addition to these databases, the University 
database was also used. Searches were also undertaken using keyword combinations 
such as dietary supplements and the names of the diseases in question.
RESULT AND DISCUSSION: This review chronicled the therapeutic values of 
vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fruits, vegetables, herbs and other botanicals 
used as dietary supplements. Results show that these supplements provided better 
and safe substitutes to toxic and expensive conventional drugs. Generally 
dietary supplements are free from major side effects, readily available and 
affordable. It is envisaged that the use of dietary supplement will promote good 
health and improve the status of hypertensive and diabetic patients.
CONCLUSION: Medical doctors are therefore encouraged to incorporate dietary 
supplements into the regimen employed for hypertension and diabetes management.
