arterial pressure (MAP) during SCI surgery predicts long-term functional 
recovery in rodent models, motivating the present multicenter study in patients.
METHODS: Intra-operative monitoring records and neurological outcome data were 
extracted (n = 118 patients). We built a similarity network of patients from a 
low-dimensional space embedded using a non-linear algorithm, Isomap, and ensured 
topological extraction using persistent homology metrics. Confirmatory analysis 
was conducted through regression methods.
RESULTS: Network analysis suggested that time outside of an optimum MAP range 
(hypotension or hypertension) during surgery was associated with lower 
likelihood of neurological recovery at hospital discharge. Logistic and LASSO 
(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression confirmed these 
findings, revealing an optimal MAP range of 76-[104-117] mmHg associated with 
neurological recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that deviation from this optimal MAP range during SCI 
surgery predicts lower probability of neurological recovery and suggest new 
targets for therapeutic intervention.

Plain Language Summary: Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that 
involves damage to the nerve fibers connecting the brain with the spinal cord, 
often leading to permanent changes in strength, sensation and body functions, 
and in severe cases paralysis. Scientists around the world work hard to find 
ways to treat or even repair spinal cord injuries but few patients with complete 
immediate paralysis recover fully. Immediate paralysis is caused by direct 
damage to neurons and their extension in the spinal cord. Previous research has 
shown that blood pressure regulation may be key in saving these damaged neurons, 
as spinal cord injuries can break the communication between nerves that is 
involved in controlling blood pressure. This can lead to a vicious cycle of 
dysregulation of blood pressure and limit the supply of blood and oxygen to the 
damaged spinal cord tissue, exacerbating the death of spinal neurons. Management 
of blood pressure is therefore a key target for spinal cord injury care, but so 
far, the precise thresholds to enable neurons to recover are poorly understood. 
To find out more, Torres-Espin, Haefeli et al. used machine learning software to 
analyze previously recorded blood pressure and heart rate data obtained from 118 
patients that underwent spinal cord surgery after acute spinal cord injury. The 
analyses revealed that patients who suffered from either low or high blood 
pressure during surgery had poorer prospects of recovery. Statistical models 
confirming these findings showed that the optimal blood pressure range to ensure 
recovery lies between 76 to 104-117 mmHg. Any deviation from this narrow window 
would dramatically worsen the ability to recover. These findings suggests that 
dysregulated blood pressure during surgery affects to odds of recovery in 
patients with a spinal cord injury. Torres-Espin, Haefeli et al. provide 
specific information that could improve current clinical practice in trauma 
centers. In the future, such machine learning tools and models could help 
develop real-time models that could predict the likelihood of a patient’s 
recovery following spinal cord injury and related neurological conditions.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities has 
increased. The implications of ageing have resulted in changes in their support 
needs and challenges to support staff. Access to evidence based strategies for 
support staff providing care to elderly with intellectual disabilities remains 
scarce. A systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of available 
psychosocial interventions.
METHODS: Four databases were searched and assessed according to the PRISMA 
guidelines. A narrative, integrative method of analysis was conducted to 
synthesise quantitative and qualitative data.
RESULTS: The 36 studies included in the review reported on interventions aimed 
at either identifying and meeting the needs or perceptions of older individuals 
or at improving their behaviour and skills. Furthermore, the role of support 
staff in the implementation of interventions was either active, assisting or 
undefined.
CONCLUSIONS: This overview of studies could contribute to the existing body of 
knowledge and help to optimise psychosocial support for a growing population.

End-Stage Renal Disease: Medical Management.

Wouk N(1).

Author information:
(1)Piedmont Health Services, Prospect Hill, NC, USA.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is diagnosed when kidney function is no longer 
adequate for long-term survival without kidney transplantation or dialysis. 
Primary care clinicians should refer people at risk of ESRD to nephrology to 
optimize disease management. Kidney transplantation typically yields the best 
patient outcomes, although most patients are treated with dialysis. The decision 
to initiate dialysis is best made through shared decision-making. Because most 
patients with ESRD elect to receive hemodialysis, the preservation of peripheral 
veins is important for those with stage III to V chronic kidney disease. A 
palliative approach to ESRD is a reasonable alternative to dialysis, 
particularly for individuals with limited life expectancy, with severe comorbid 
conditions, or who wish to avoid medical interventions. For patients with ESRD, 
vaccination against seasonal influenza, tetanus, hepatitis B, human 
papillomavirus (through 26 years of age), and Streptococcus pneumoniae is 
advised. Routine cancer screening for patients not receiving kidney 
transplantation is discouraged. Controlling blood pressure in patients receiving 
dialysis improves mortality. Volume control through adequate dialysis and sodium 
restriction can help optimize hypertension treatment in these patients. Insulin 
is the preferred treatment for patients with ESRD and diabetes mellitus 
requiring medication. Patients should be monitored for signs of protein-energy 
wasting and malnutrition. Clinicians must be aware of the many medical 
complications associated with ESRD.

PURPOSE: Disabilities are increasing globally, which is attributed to the 
overall ageing of populations in affluent countries. This trend may differ in 
low and middle-income countries. This paper assesses the change over time in 
Years Lived with Disability (YLD) for South Africa and how this compares to 
regional and global trends.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2017 dataset describes the observed contribution of YLD to 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100 000 people over the period 
1990-2016, and forecast to 2030 using simple linear prediction. South African 
trends are compared to global and sub-Saharan African (SSA) trends to highlight 
the effect of HIV and policy implications.
RESULTS: Globally, the contribution of YLD to DALYs has increased from ±21.7% in 
1990 to ±34% by 2016, with high socio-demographic index countries having a 
higher contribution (49%). HIV, mental health, musculoskeletal, neurological, 
and sense organ disorders are the five main contributors to YLD in South Africa 
(54%). Removing the effects of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections on 
YLD, South Africa's trend appears similar to the global trend, yet opposite to 
the SSA trend.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows there is a growing burden of disability in South 
Africa. Differences in trends with the regional and global patterns can be 
attributed to the high burden of HIV and non-communicable diseases in South 
Africa. Therefore, strategies are urgently needed to increase integration of 
disability and rehabilitation services into chronic HIV and non-communicable 
disease management. This calls for disability screening to identify functional 
limitations in routine data collection and case management.IMPLICATIONS FOR 
REHABILITATIONSouth Africa has experienced an increase in disability prevalence 
over time.This requires strengthening of services such as mental health 
interventions, physiotherapy, optometry, and audiology, and linking major 
disease clusters, such as HIV and the NCDs, to rehabilitation services.The 
greatest contributors towards disability adjusted life years in South Africa are 
currently mental disorders (13.8%), HIV and sexually transmitted infections 
(11.8%), musculoskeletal disorders (10.4%), neurological disorders (8.2%), and 
sense organ diseases (7.5%).Routine data collection and case management needs to 
include disability screening to identify developing functional limitations.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of breast reduction surgery for 
women with symptomatic breast hypertrophy in Australia.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis of data from a prospective cohort study.
SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Adult women with symptomatic breast hypertrophy assessed 
for bilateral breast reduction at the Flinders Medical Centre, a public tertiary 
hospital in Adelaide, April 2007 - February 2018. The control group included 
women with breast hypertrophy who had not undergone surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health care costs (for the surgical admission and other 
related hospital costs within 12 months of surgery) and SF-6D utility scores 
(measure of health-related quality of life) were used to calculate incremental 
costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over 12 months, extrapolated 
to a 10-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Of 251 women who underwent breast reduction, 209 completed the baseline 
and at least one post-operation assessment (83%; intervention group); 124 of 350 
invited women waiting for breast reduction surgery completed the baseline and 
12-month assessments (35%; control group). In the intervention group, the mean 
SF-6D utility score increased from 0.313 (SD, 0.263) at baseline to 0.626 (SD, 
0.277) at 12 months; in the control group, it declined from 0.296 (SD, 0.267) to 
0.270 (SD, 0.257). The mean QALY gain was consequently greater for the 
intervention group (adjusted difference, 1.519; 95% CI, 1.362-1.675). The mean 
hospital cost per patient was $11 857 (SD, $4322), and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the intervention was $7808 per QALY gained. 
The probability of breast reduction surgery being cost-effective was 100% at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY and 88% at $28 033 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Breast reduction surgery for women with symptomatic breast 
hypertrophy is cost-effective and should be available to women through the 
Australian public healthcare system.

Social vulnerabilities increase the risk of developing hypertension and lower 
life expectancy, but the effect of an individual's overall vulnerability burden 
is unknown. Our objective was to determine the association of social 
vulnerability count and the risk of developing hypertension or dying over 10 
years and whether these associations vary by race. We used the REGARDS study 
(Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) and included 
participants without baseline hypertension. The primary exposure was the count 
of social vulnerabilities defined across economic, education, health and health 
care, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context 
domains. Among 5425 participants of mean age 64±10 SD years of which 24% were 
Black participants, 1468 (31%) had 1 vulnerability and 717 (15%) had ≥2 
vulnerabilities. Compared with participants without vulnerabilities, the 
adjusted relative risk ratio for developing hypertension was 1.16 (95% CI, 
0.99-1.36) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.20-1.85) for individuals with 1 and ≥2 
vulnerabilities, respectively. The adjusted relative risk ratio for death was 
1.55 (95% CI, 1.24-1.93) and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.75-3.04) for individuals with 1 and 
≥2 vulnerabilities, respectively. A greater proportion of Black participants 
developed hypertension and died than did White participants (hypertension, 38% 
versus 31%; death, 25% versus 20%). The vulnerability count association was 
strongest in White participants (P value for vulnerability count×race 
interaction: hypertension=0.046, death=0.015). Overall, a greater number of 
socially determined vulnerabilities was associated with progressively higher 
risk of developing hypertension, and an even higher risk of dying over 10 years.

BACKGROUND: If untreated, Lyme disease can lead to long-term sequelae and 
post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), resulting in reduced 
health-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to develop a 
microsimulation model to estimate the population-level health burden of Lyme 
disease in Ontario, Canada.
METHODS: We developed a Lyme disease history model using microsimulation, 
simulating 100 000 people (mean age 37.6 yr, 51% female) from 2017 in Ontario 
over a lifetime risk of infection and time horizon. We extracted the sensitivity 
and specificity of the 2-tier testing recommended by the Canadian Public Health 
Laboratory Network, probabilities and health state utility values from the 
published literature and health administrative data. Our reported outcomes from 
our stochastic analysis include diagnosed cases of Lyme disease (stratified by 
stage), undiagnosed infections, sequelae, individuals with PTLDS and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost.
RESULTS: Our model estimated 333 (95% confidence interval [CI] 329-337) 
infections over the lifetime of 100 000 simulated people (mean age 37.6 yr, 51% 
female), with 92% (95% CI 91%-93%) of infections diagnosed. Of those 308 people 
with Lyme Disease diagnoses, 67 (95% CI 65-69) developed sequelae (e.g., 
arthritic, cardiac, neurologic sequelae), and 34 (95% CI 33-35) developed PTLDS. 
Lyme disease resulted in a loss of 84.5 QALYs (95% CI 82.9-86.2) over the 
lifetime of the simulated cohort. Sensitivity and scenario analysis showed that 
increasing incidence rates of Lyme disease, potential underreporting, duration 
of PTLDS and quality of life (health state utility) associated with PTLDS had 
the greatest impact on health burden.
INTERPRETATION: Lyme disease contributes considerable health burden in terms of 
QALYs lost. Our analysis provides evidence to understand the disease burden and 
lays the foundation to assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical and 
nonpharmaceutical interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Adolescent obesity is a public health problem in the UK. The 
Weight-Specific Adolescent Instrument for Economic Evaluation (WAItE) has been 
developed as the first weight-specific health-related quality of life measure 
appropriate for economic evaluation, but currently cannot be used to generate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which are the basis of cost-utility 
analysis. Generic measures (such as the EQ-5D-Y or CHU-9D) may be insensitive to 
small but important health changes in overweight or obese adolescents. This 
study aims to generate a preference-based scoring algorithm for the WAItE.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) will be administered to 
value health states described by the WAItE classification system. These health 
states will be presented to members of the adult general population of the UK 
via an online survey. A range of regression models will be used to produce the 
utility algorithm for the WAItE. The DCE-visual analogue scale and time 
trade-off (TTO) anchoring methods will be used anchor the value set on to the 
0-1 QALY scale.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Newcastle University Medical School Ethics 
Committee approved the study (references 4772/2020 (DCE) and 9978/2020 (TTO)). 
The developed algorithm can be applied to future economic evaluations of weight 
management interventions and treatments for adolescents.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy has reduced mortality and led to longer 
life expectancy in people living with HIV. These patients are now at an 
increased risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Integration of care for HIV 
and NCDs has become a focus of research and policy. In this article, we aim to 
review patient perspectives on integration of healthcare for HIV, type 2 
diabetes and hypertension.
METHODS: The framework for scoping reviews developed by Arksey and O'Malley and 
updated by Peter et al was applied for this review. The databases PubMed, Web of 
Science and Cochrane library were searched. Broad search terms for HIV, NCDs 
(specifically type 2 diabetes and hypertension) and healthcare integration were 
used. As the review aimed to identify definitions of patient perspectives, they 
were not included as an independent term in the search strategy. References of 
included publications were searched for relevant articles. Titles and abstracts 
for these papers were screened by two independent reviewers. The full texts for 
all the publications appearing to meet the inclusion criteria were then read to 
make the final literature selection.
RESULTS: Of 5502 studies initially identified, 13 articles were included in this 
review, of which 11 had a geographical origin in sub-Saharan Africa. Nine 
articles were primarily focused on HIV/diabetes healthcare integration while 
four articles were focused on HIV/hypertension integration. Patient's 
experiences with integrated care were reduced HIV-related stigma, reduced travel 
and treatment costs and a more holistic person-centred care. Prominent concerns 
were long waiting times at clinics and a lack of continuity of care in some 
clinics due to a lack of healthcare workers. Non-integrated care was perceived 
as time-consuming and more expensive.
CONCLUSION: Patient perspectives and experiences on integrated care for HIV, 
diabetes and hypertension were mostly positive. Integrated services can save 
resources and allow for a more personalised approach to healthcare. There is a 
paucity of evidence and further longitudinal and interventional evidence from a 
more diverse range of healthcare systems are needed.

Several fish species propel by oscillating the tail, while the remaining part of 
the body essentially contributes to the overall drag. Since in this case thrust 
and drag are in a way separable, most attention was focused on the study of 
propulsive efficiency for flapping foils under a prescribed stream. We claim 
here that the swimming performance should be evaluated, as for undulating fish 
whose drag and thrust are severely entangled, by turning to self-propelled 
locomotion to find the proper speed and the cost of transport for a given 
fishlike body. As a major finding, the minimum value of this quantity 
corresponds to a locomotion speed in a range markedly different from the one 
associated with the optimal efficiency of the propulsor. A large value of the 
feathering parameter characterizes the minimum cost of transport while the 
optimal efficiency is related to a large effective angle of attack. We adopt 
here a simple two-dimensional model for both inviscid and viscous flows to proof 
the above statements in the case of self-propelled axial swimming. We believe 
that such an easy approach gives a way for a direct extension to fully free 
swimming and to real-life configurations.

Although European integration can be expected to result in mortality convergence 
(reduced mortality differences), a life expectancy divide persists in the 
European Union (EU) between the old Member States (OMS) in the west and the new 
Member States (NMS) in the east. Studies investigating the impact of European 
integration on mortality convergence are rare and did not consider regional 
differences. We examine the short-term effects of the 2004 enlargement on 
mortality convergence at the supranational, national, and subnational levels. 
Using sex-specific life expectancies for 23 Member States (1990-2017) and the 
NUTS 2 regions in Czechia, Hungary, and Poland for 1992-2016, we examined the 
trend in sigma and beta mortality convergence measures at the country and 
regional levels using joinpoint regression. We found no compelling evidence that 
EU accession influenced the process of mortality convergence between OMS and 
NMS, or within the three NMS, over the short term. While there was overall beta 
and sigma convergence at the national level during 1990-2017, no regional 
convergence showed, and the trends in convergence did not significantly change 
at the time of EU accession or soon after (2004-2007). The accession in 2004 did 
not visibly impact the overall process of mortality convergence over the short 
term, likely because of the greater influence of country and region-specific 
policies and characteristics. The interaction of Member State and regional 
contexts with the mechanisms of European integration requires further study. 
Future enlargement procedures should emphasise tailored support to ensure more 
equitable gains from European integration.

Women have consistently lower mortality rates than men at all ages and with 
respect to most causes. However, gender differences regarding hospital admission 
rates are more mixed, varying across ages and causes. A number of intuitive 
metrics have previously been used to explore changes in hospital admissions over 
time, but have not explicitly quantified the gender gap or estimated the 
cumulative contribution from cause-specific admission rates. Using register data 
for the total Danish population between 1995 and 2014, we estimated the time to 
first hospital admission for Danish men and women aged 60. This is an intuitive 
population-level metric with the same interpretive and mathematical properties 
as period life expectancy. Using a decomposition approach, we were able to 
quantify the cumulative contributions from eight causes of hospital admission to 
the gender gap in time to first hospital admission. Between 1995 and 2014, time 
to first admission increased for both, men (7.6 to 9.4 years) and women (8.3 to 
10.3 years). However, the magnitude of gender differences in time to first 
admission remained relatively stable within this time period (0.7 years in 1995, 
0.9 years in 2014). After age 60, Danish men had consistently higher rates of 
admission for cardiovascular conditions and neoplasms, but lower rates of 
admission for injuries, musculoskeletal disorders, and sex-specific causes. 
Although admission rates for both genders have generally declined over the last 
decades, the same major causes of admission accounted for the gender gap. 
Persistent gender differences in causes of admission are, therefore, important 
to consider when planning the delivery of health care in times of population 
ageing.

We present an approach to extend the endemic-epidemic (EE) modelling framework 
for the analysis of infectious disease data. In its spatiotemporal formulation, 
spatial dependencies have originally been captured by static neighbourhood 
matrices. These weight matrices are adjusted over time to reflect changes in 
spatial connectivity between geographical units. We illustrate this extension by 
modelling the spread of COVID-19 disease between Swiss and bordering Italian 
regions in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The spatial weights are 
adjusted with data describing the daily changes in population mobility patterns, 
and indicators of border closures describing the state of travel restrictions 
since the beginning of the pandemic. These time-dependent weights are used to 
fit an EE model to the region-stratified time series of new COVID-19 cases. We 
then adjust the weight matrices to reflect two counterfactual scenarios of 
border closures and draw counterfactual predictions based on these, to 
retrospectively assess the usefulness of border closures. Predictions based on a 
scenario where no closure of the Swiss-Italian border occurred increased the 
number of cumulative cases in Switzerland by a factor of 2.7 (10th to 90th 
percentile: 2.2 to 3.6) over the study period. Conversely, a closure of the 
Swiss-Italian border two weeks earlier than implemented would have resulted in 
only a 12% (8% to 18%) decrease in the number of cases and merely delayed the 
epidemic spread by a couple of weeks. Our study provides useful insight into 
modelling the effect of epidemic countermeasures on the spatiotemporal spread of 
COVID-19.
