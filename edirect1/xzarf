authorities toward more objective and transparent decision-making. When 
evaluating a new drug therapy, we recommend the use of multiple RBA approaches 
across different therapeutic indications and treatment populations in order to 
bound the risk-benefit profile.

OBJECTIVE: Oncotype DX, a 21-gene assay, was clinically validated as a predictor 
of 10-year recurrence-free survival and treatment response in patients with 
early-stage estrogen-receptor-positive, lymph-node negative breast cancer (ER+ 
LN- ESBC). This study determined "real-life" alteration in treatment decision 
and economic implications of Oncotype DX use in women with ER+ LN- ESBC.
METHODS: Clalit Health Services (CHS, Tel Aviv, Israel), determined the 
proportion of women in low, intermediate and high-risk groups in the first 368 
Oncotype DX assays performed, the change of adjuvant therapy recommendation 
following the recurrence (RS) results from Oncotype DX use, and associated 
chemotherapy costs. The risk of recurrence-free survival was derived from 
prespecified statistical protocols of NCI-sponsored trials conducted by NSABP 
(B-14 and B-20). Utilities were literature based. A 3% discount rate was 
employed.
RESULTS: Oncotype DX altered recommendations of 40% of patients, 84% of whom 
were changed from hormone + chemotherapy to hormonal therapy alone. Among 
high-risk women, 8% switched actual treatment from hormonal therapy to hormone + 
chemotherapy. By reducing the chemotherapy disutility, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) increased 0.170 years. Use of Oncotype DX costs $10,770 per 
QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses revealed that risk reduction in the low-risk 
population, the cost of adverse events, and the relative risk reduction of 
recurrence were the most influential variables.
CONCLUSION: Oncotype DX resulted in net QALY gain and increased overall costs, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,770. For CHS, Oncotype DX 
represents an effective and affordable approach to favorably affect the lives of 
women with ESBC.

Northern Territory 0811, Australia.

Indigenous Australians suffer significant disadvantage in health outcomes and 
have a life expectancy well below that of non-Indigenous Australians. Mortality 
rates of Indigenous Australians are higher than that of Indigenous populations 
in developed countries elsewhere in the world. A number of parasitic diseases 
which are uncommon in the rest of the Australian population contribute to the 
high burden of disease in many remote Indigenous communities. High rates of 
infection with enteric parasites such as Strongyloides stercoralis, hookworm and 
Trichuris have been recorded and infection of the skin with the ecto-parasitic 
mite Sarcoptes scabiei is also a substantial problem. Secondary infection of 
scabies lesions, including with Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus, 
can produce serious sequelae such as rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal 
glomerulonephritis. Transmission of many parasites in many remote communities is 
facilitated by overcrowded living conditions and infrastructure problems which 
result in poor sanitation and hygiene. Improvements in environmental health 
conditions must accompany medical initiatives to achieve sustainable improvement 
in the health of Indigenous Australians.

Chiayi, Taiwan.

CONTEXT: A better time-to-death (TTD) prediction can facilitate decision-making 
processes related to plans for providing effective end-of-life care for patients 
in hospice wards.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of cardiovascular autonomic functions with 
TTD in patients with terminal hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted with 33 patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma recruited from the hospice ward of a regional hospital in Chiayi 
county, Taiwan. Serum creatinine, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, 
serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum 
albumin were measured on the admission day. Cardiovascular autonomic functions 
were evaluated by frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) on 
admission.
RESULTS: TTD was significantly associated with total spectrum power (TP) 
(r=0.55, P=0.001) and high frequency (HF power) (r=0.44, P=0.010) of HRV 
measurement. The accuracy of within-one-week TTD prediction was 67% for TP and 
HF power. The accuracy of within-two-week TTD prediction was 82% for TP and 73% 
for HF. In addition, TTD of the patients was also significantly associated with 
serum creatinine (r=-0.42, P=0.015), serum albumin (r=-0.46, P=0.007), and BUN 
(r=-0.44, P=0.010).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the association between 
cardiovascular autonomic functions and TTD in patients with terminal 
hepatocellular carcinoma. The inclusion of HRV measurement in prognostic models 
may improve accuracy in TTD prediction and, hence, facilitate medical decision 
making in hospice care.

Long-term health and economic impact of preventing and reducing overweight and 
obesity in adolescence.

Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

PURPOSE: Using data from the 2000 National Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and 
estimates from published studies, this study projected the long-term health and 
economic impacts of preventing and reducing overweight and obesity in today's 
adolescents.
METHODS: We developed a body mass index progression model to project the impact 
of a 1% point reduction in both overweight and obese adolescents aged 16-17 
years at present on the number of nonoverweight, overweight, and obese adults at 
age 40 years. We then estimated its impact on the lifetime medical costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) after age 40. Medical costs (in 2007 
dollars) and QALYs were discounted to age 17 years.
RESULTS: A 1% point reduction in both overweight and obese adolescents ages 
16-17 years at present could reduce the number of obese adults by 52,821 in the 
future. As a result, lifetime medical care costs after age 40 years would 
decrease by $586 million and lifetime QALYs would increase by 47,138. In the 
worst case scenario, the 1% point reduction would lower medical costs by $463 
million and increase QALYs by 34,394; in the best case scenario, it would reduce 
medical costs by $691 million and increase QALYs by 57,149.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity prevention in adolescents goes beyond its immediate 
benefits; it can also reduce medical costs and increase QALYs substantially in 
later life. Therefore, it is important to include long-term health and economic 
benefits when quantifying the impact of obesity prevention in adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Due to the improvement in life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF), 
co-morbidities such as renal function impairment may be more frequent.
AIM: To determine the prevalence of renal disease in children with CF and to 
identify associated risk factors.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective study analyzing the genetic, clinical and 
therapeutic characteristics of 112 children. The estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR), microalbuminuria and lithiasic risk factors were assessed.
RESULTS: The median calculated GFR (Schwartz) was 123, 161 and 
155ml/min/1.73m(2) in children aged 1, 6 and 15years, respectively. The 
cumulative dose of aminoglycosides was not correlated to GFR. Microalbuminuria 
was present in 22/38 patients. Hyperoxaluria was observed in 58/83 patients and 
was associated with a severe genotype, pancreas insufficiency and liver disease. 
Hypercalciuria, hyperuricuria and hypocitraturia were identified in 16/87, 15/83 
and 57/76 patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Renal impairment in CF has various presentations. There appears to 
be low levels of renal impairment in children with CF. However, the risk of 
oxalocalcic urolithiasis is enhanced, and GFR may be underestimated by the 
Schwartz formula. Further studies using measured GFR techniques are thus 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have strongly 
diminished in the HAART era, but their impact on life expectancy of people with 
AIDS (PWA) needs to be monitored. We aimed at quantifying the burden of KS and 
NHL on mortality of PWA in the HAART period in Italy.
METHODS: Death certificates of 3209 PWA diagnosed in 1999-2006 who died as of 
December 2006 were reviewed to identify those deaths in which KS or NHL was the 
underlying cause. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were computed.
RESULTS: KS or NHL appeared in 4.3% and 14.6% death certificates, respectively; 
they were the underlying cause of death in 3.1% and 13.4% of cases. SMR were 
8698-fold higher for KS and 349-fold higher for NHL, and tended to decline over 
the study period.
CONCLUSION: KS and NHL caused about 16% of deaths of PWA in the HAART era, with 
100-fold higher risks of death compared to the Italian general population also 
in recent years. Clinicians and public health officials should be aware of the 
persisting negative impact of these cancers on life expectancy of PWA.

A descriptive study, using a quantitative approach to evaluate the strategies 
carried through by nurses in a school environment of a Municipal Center of 
Children Education, through the Project of Extension Learning Health in the 
School, and still to analyze the profile of the children attended. The research 
was carried through with a sample of 350 nursing attendances. We verify that in 
10 pupils had been found suggestive corporal lesions of family 
violence/negligence. They were registered educative activities, involving the 
following subjects: dengue, personal hygiene, parasitosis and the destination of 
the solid residues. We evidence that 4.6% of the children attended were unfed, 
and that 6.4% were in nutritional risk, and that 80% of children did not 
presented an adequate oral hygiene, demonstrated through the presence of caries. 
In the evaluation of the professors about the performance of the project it was 
possible to identify stories on the reduction of the episodes of domestic 
violence against the child. The Project has provided to the action of the 
Interdisciplinary work favoring the health promotion activities having the 
school as a space of the Basic Attention, and need to be understood as a 
motivator nucleus of the participatory performance of the health professionals 
in the pertaining to school community.

Uncemented total hip arthroplasty in patients younger than 50 years: a 6- to 
10-year follow-up study.

Young patients are expected to place increased demands on total hip arthroplasty 
(THA) because they are more active and have a longer life expectancy. The 
long-term outcome of the Charnley low-friction arthroplasty in young, active 
patients has been shown to be associated with a high degree of polyethylene wear 
and osteolysis. However, cementless acetabular components have been shown to be 
successful in young patients.We evaluated the clinical and radiographic results 
of 77 cementless THAs in 81 young, active patients at a mean follow-up of 7.5 
years. Mean preoperative Harris Hip Score improved from 46.24 to 96.5 points at 
6 years. One acetabular component showed aseptic loosening 10 years 
postoperatively. Three patients (3 hips) underwent bone grafts and liner renewal 
for severe osteolysis around the acetabular component. The rate of survival at 6 
years for loosening was 98.8%, and for revision of the liner was 95.5% (95% 
confidence interval, 93%-98%). Mean liner wear rate was 0.125 mm/year (range, 
0.0-0.39 mm/year). Acetabular osteolysis was found in 14% (9 hips) of the 67 
hips and was related to polyethylene wear (P=.0024). Although there was only 1 
cup loosening in this study, there was a high rate of linear wear of the 
polyethylene liner and acetabular osteolysis in young, active patients. Further 
follow-up is therefore needed, and osteolysis and polyethylene wear should 
continue to be observed in young, active patients.

AIMS: Individuals with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and the Haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 
genotype are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As the antioxidant 
function of the Hp 2-2 protein is impaired, we sought to test the 
pharmacogenomic hypothesis that antioxidant vitamin E supplementation would 
provide cardiovascular protection to Hp 2-2 DM individuals.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We determined the Hp genotype on DM participants from two 
trials (HOPE and ICARE) and assessed the effect of vitamin E by Hp genotype on 
their common prespecified outcome, the composite of stroke, myocardial 
infarction and cardiovascular death. Data was analyzed with a fixed-effect 
model. These results were input into a simulation model, the Evidence Based 
Medicine Integrator, in order to estimate their long-term implications in a 
real-world population from Kaiser Permanente (CA, USA).
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the two trials demonstrated a significant overall 
reduction in the composite end point in Hp 2-2 DM individuals with vitamin E 
(odds ratio: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86; p = 0.006). There was a statistically 
significant interaction between the Hp genotype and vitamin E on the composite 
end point. In these trials, Hp typing of 69 DM individuals and treating those 
with the Hp 2-2 with vitamin E prevented one myocardial infarct, stroke or 
cardiovascular death. Lifelong administration of vitamin E to Hp 2-2 DM 
individuals in the Kaiser population would increase their life expectancy by 3 
years.
CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenomic strategy of screening DM individuals for the Hp 
genotype and treating those with Hp 2-2 with vitamin E appears to be highly 
clinically effective.

Sciences, Pookot, Wayanad, Kerala, India.

Pork forequarters procured from freshly slaughtered animals were decontaminated 
with hot water and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, 
Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, 
Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteusvulgaris. The 
forequarters were individually spray washed with 5% potassium sorbate and a 
combination of 5% sodium chloride and 2.5% each of sodium acetate, sodium 
citrate, sodium lactate and potassium sorbate solutions. The total viable count 
(TVC) of the treated meat samples was reduced by 0.96 and 1.31 log units by 
spraying with salt and salt combination respectively with marginal changes in 
colour and odour scores. Inoculated organisms were found to be highly sensitive 
to salt combination treatment as compared to potassium sorbate alone. Shelf-life 
of salt and salt combination treated samples was increased to 8 and 11days as 
against 4days in untreated samples. Carcass washing with salt and salt 
combination was found to be suitable for extension of shelf-life and improvement 
in the sensory and microbiological quality of meat.

Chitosan lactate was impregnated as an antimicrobial additive into low density 
polyethylene (LDPE) with different concentrations. The antimicrobial 
effectiveness was tested with three pathogenic bacteria, specifically Listeria 
monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. Also, these chitosan 
incorporated films were applied on red meat surfaces to determine the 
effectiveness of chitosan on color shelf life extension and microbial growth 
inhibition. Chitosan was exposed to 0.1% peptone water containing the three 
pathogens in separate tests and inhibited microbial growth a higher levels with 
increasing concentration of chitosan in the film matrix. Oxygen permeability was 
not affected by the incorporation of chitosan, while the water vapor 
permeability increased with the addition of chitosan. Film elongation decreased 
with the addition of chitosan. When chitosan incorporated films were applied on 
fresh red meat, microorganisms on the meat surface were not inhibited but 
significant extension of red color shelf life were observed in refrigerated, 
sliced red meats.

Box 800159, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0159, Etats-Unis. kb8kb@virginia.edu

BACKGROUND: The Charnley stem provides good outcome for 10 years, but several 
studies find deteriorating results thereafter. However, study populations, 
techniques and data analysis vary widely. We have studied 240 Charnley stems in 
a homogeneous group of patients providing clinical, radiological and survival 
data after 11-14 years.
HYPOTHESIS: The clinical and radiological outcome of the Charnley stem is not as 
good than previously thought.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five surgeons implanted 240 femoral stems in a community 
hospital in Norway using antibiotic impregnated cement and third generation 
cementing techniques. The Charnley stems were implanted with a Charnley cup in 
120 cases and an uncemented hemispherical cup (Duraloc) in 120 cases. The mean 
age of the patients was 65.5 years and the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 26.8. 
All patients received low molecular weight heparin and antibiotic prophylaxis. 
Patients were assessed after 10 years by means of Harris Hip Score (HHS)and 
radiographic evaluation. Implant survival studies were performed after 11-14 
years.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients were available for clinical and 
radiographic evaluation after 10 years. HHS improved from 48.4 (95% CI: 
46.6-50,2) preoperatively to 87.9 (95%CI: 86.6-89.3) after 6 months and 87.6 
(95% CI: 85.3-89.8) at 10 years. Thirty-one stems had been revised, the reasons 
for revision were loosening (21), infection (five), instability (four) and late 
perisprosthetic fracture (one). Forty-one stems had one or more signs of 
loosening.Stem survival was 83.6% using any revisions as end point, and mean 
estimated stem survival was 12.7 years (12.2-13.3 years).
DISCUSSION: Other studies report survival at mid-term from 83-96%. Our results 
are in the low-end. Even though our rate of infection was high (2%), the main 
cause of the poor results is aseptic loosening. We do not know the reason for 
this high-rate of loosening. As we believe that our technique is adequate and 
patient population average, we suspect that this rate of loosening is a 
characteristic of the implant. Results from this prospective cohort study add to 
the evidence that the Charnley stem should not be used hip arthroplasty unless 
patient life expectancy is less than 10 years.

BACKGROUND: The main objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of 
echocardiography-detected right ventricle dysfunction (RVD) or pulmonary 
hypertension (PHT) and its correlation with computed tomography pulmonary 
angiography (CTPA) in hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism 
(PE), both at diagnosis and after 6 months follow-up.
METHODS: Prospective, descriptive, single-center follow-up study.
STUDY POPULATION: 103 consecutive patients, with a life expectancy of >6 months, 
presenting with PE and a systolic blood pressure> or =90mmHg. Echocardiography 
and CTPA were performed at diagnosis and after 6 months.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, RVD and isolated PHT were found in 24.5% and 19.6% of 
patients, respectively. CTPA and echocardiography correlated significantly at 
diagnosis. However, CTPA could not predict accurately RVD or PHT. Persistence of 
RVD and isolated PHT was observed in 7.9% and 11.8% of cases, respectively, 6 
months later. Intraluminal filling defects disappeared in 79%. No new filling 
defects were seen in any patient. Excluding cases with comorbidities that might 
account for PHT, CTPA was normal at the 6th month in 23.1% of patients with and 
in 87.8% of cases without persistent RVD or PHT, respectively (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: RVD or PHT are a frequent finding at diagnosis in patients with 
hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism and they persist at 6 months in a 
significant proportion of cases. We have observed a relationship between the 
persistence of residual vascular obstruction in CTPA and RVD or PHT 6 months 
after PE.

Sick Children, Sciennes Road, Edinburgh, EH9 1LF, UK.

Scoliosis is a common deformity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. 
This is usually associated with pelvic obliquity due to extension of the curve 
to the sacrum. Sagittal plane deformity is less common and often develops along 
with scoliosis. Spinal deformity in patients with severe neurological handicaps 
can affect their ability to sit and cause significant back pain or pain due to 
rib impingement against the elevated side of the pelvis on the concavity of the 
curvature. Surgical correction followed by spinal arthrodesis is indicated in 
patients with progressive deformities which interfere with their level of 
function and quality of life. Spinal deformity correction is a major task in 
children with multiple medical co-morbidities and can be associated with a high 
risk of complications including death. A well-coordinated multidisciplinary 
approach is required in the assessment and treatment of this group of patients 
with the aim to minimize the complication rate and secure a satisfactory 
surgical outcome. Good knowledge of the surgical and instrumentation techniques, 
as well as the principles of management is needed to achieve optimum correction 
of the deformity and balancing of the spine and pelvis. Spinal fusion has a 
well-documented positive impact even in children with quadriplegia or total body 
involvement and is the only surgical procedure which has such a high 
satisfaction rate among parents and caregivers.

We find that a cross-country model of economic growth successfully tracks the 
growth takeoffs in China and India. The major drivers of the predicted takeoffs 
are improved health, increased openness to trade, and a rising labor 
force-to-population ratio due to fertility decline. We also explore the effect 
of the reallocation of labor from low-productivity agriculture to the 
higher-productivity industry and service sectors. Including the money value of 
longevity improvements in a measure of full income reduces the gap between the 
magnitude of China's takeoff relative to India's due to the relative stagnation 
in life expectancy in China since 1980.

Inflammatory myopathies, also referred to as myositis, are a heterogeneous group 
of chronic inflammatory muscle diseases characterized by various clinical 
features and histological changes; in addition, patient with these disease 
exhibit positivity for autoantibodies as well as progressive inflammatory muscle 
damage and experienced weakness. Although it has been well known for a century 
that myositis, particularly dermatomyositis, can be associated with malignancy, 
it was not until recently that the result of robust epidemiological studies 
confirmed this association. Malignancy-associated myositis differs from primary 
myositis in many aspects. Prognosis and life expectancy for patients are 
determined on the basis of the underlying malignancy. Therefore, 
patient-specific examinations to detect an underlying cancer are important for 
the management of these patients. Recently, a novel myositis-specific 
autoantibody (anti-p155 or p155/p140 antibody) was identified in 
malignancy-associated myositis. The discovery of this autoantibody is important 
not only for an early diagnosis of adult-onset myositis patients with a higher 
risk of malignancy but also for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of 
paraneoplastic myositis. In addition, it has also been recently found that both 
regenerating cells in myositis muscles and several cancers known to be 
associated with myositis express high levels of myositis-specific autoantigens. 
Therefore, a model of paraneoplasia focusing on the expression of common 
autoantigens expression and immuno-targeting between cancer and muscle tissues 
in myositis has been proposed. In this review, we aim to describe 
epidemiological evidence for an association between myositis and malignancy, and 
to describe the clinical features of malignancy-associated myositis. We also aim 
to focus on a recently proposed model to understand the development of 
malignancy-associated myositis.

Management of prostate cancer in HIV-positive patients.

Wosnitzer MS(1), Lowe FC.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 
10032, USA.

Improved medical therapy for HIV-positive patients has helped delay the 
progression of HIV to AIDS and reduce AIDS deaths. This dramatically prolonged 
survival has resulted in increased detection of non-AIDS-defining malignancies, 
such as prostate cancer, in people with HIV. Reported prostate cancer incidences 
in HIV-positive men compared with the general population vary in different 
studies; however, its incidence in the general population has generally 
increased over time, owing to the widespread use of PSA testing and increased 
life expectancy. In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, 
evidence indicates that PSA kinetics and prostate cancer behavior are similar in 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Current American Urological Association 
(AUA) guidelines recommend screening of all men aged >or=40 years with a life 
expectancy >10 years, and HIV-positive patients should be included in this 
recommendation. Treatment options for HIV-positive patients with prostate cancer 
should include all those offered to the general population. Long-term treatment 
outcomes in HIV-positive patients remain uncertain; however, early results 
suggest response rates similar to those in HIV-negative patients.

INTRODUCTION: In patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy for ST-elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI), adjunct treatment with enoxaparin has been shown 
to provide superior net clinical benefit compared with unfractionated heparin 
(UFH) in the Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial 
Infarction Treatment - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 
study. The objective of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of 
enoxaparin and UFH strategies.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a two-stage model: (1) A 
30-day decision tree analytical model for the acute treatment phase, and (2) a 
lifetime Markov model (from 30 days post-STEMI until death) populated using 
patient survival data.
RESULTS: Assuming treatment continuation for 7 days, the mean day 1-30 
incremental cost associated with enoxaparin was pound 49 per patient, and mean 
lifetime incremental cost was pound 592 per patient ( pound 91,091 vs. pound 
90,499, respectively). Given an additional 0.048 life years gained per patient 
with enoxaparin, the cost per life year saved was pound 12,353, and given an 
additional 0.038 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) per patient with enoxaparin, 
the cost per QALY was pound 15,413. In an alternative scenario, reflecting 
contemporary practice assuming early treatment discontinuation at 48 hours, for 
example following urgent revascularization, the incremental cost per QALY was 
pound 13,556.
CONCLUSION: The use of an enoxaparin versus UFH strategy in patients receiving 
fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI, whether continued for 7 days or discontinued 
early, for example following urgent revascularization, is cost effective at a 
pound 20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.

Neurosurgery, Kosice, Slovakia.

BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic epidural haematoma (EDH) of the temporal region is the 
most common site of supratentorial extradural bleeding; other locations are 
considered atypical. We reviewed 24 patients with EDH located in the posterior 
cranial fossa (PFEDH) treated at two neurosurgical centres between January 2000 
and November 2006.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the retrospective study we analysed gender and age 
distribution, type of injury, clinical presentation, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
score on admission, radiological images, interval between trauma and surgery, 
and outcome.
RESULTS: 24 patients with PFEDH constituted 11.5% of 209 surgically treated 
individuals with EDH. The best outcomes were obtained by patients with GCS 
scores of 15-14 on admission. Patients in the fourth to seventh decade of life 
had less favourable outcomes than younger ones. More than half of the patients 
with PFEDH had associated intradural lesions. Only patients with concomitant 
brain contusion had a more favourable recovery. The 3 worst levels on the 
Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were observed in patients suffering from subdural or 
intracerebral haematoma, or both, associated with the PFEDHs. The majority of 
patients with concurrent lesions and supratentorial extension of the haemorrhage 
were in the subgroup undergoing craniotomy between 24 and 72 h after injury. 
Patients treated in this time interval also had the most unfavourable outcomes. 
A classical lucid interval was observed only in one patient. The mortality rate 
in the series was 4.2%.
CONCLUSION: The most significant factors influencing outcome in our patients 
were GCS on admission, age, and associated intradural lesions.

Time, clinic technologies, and the making of reflexive longevity: the cultural 
work of time left in an ageing society.

Francisco, CA, USA.

Developments in clinical intervention are having a profound impact on health and 
health behaviours in late life and on ideas about longevity and the appropriate 
time for death. The fact that the timing of death is even considered to be a 
controllable event is a relatively new cultural phenomenon. The activities that 
make up life extension, like other medical practices scrutinised by social 
scientists, constitute a site for the emergence of new forms of subjectivity. 
For older adults the clinical encounter forces a calculation about how much time 
left is wanted in relation to age. The twin dimensions of the transformation of 
time highlighted in this article - the control over the timing of death and the 
creation of time left - both contribute to and are a widespread effect of 
biomedicalisation in affluent sectors of society. Through three stories this 
paper begins to map the cultural work that the concept, time left, does, the 
socio-medical ways in which that notion is talked about, organised and 
calculated in the American clinic today. It asks, what kind of subject emerges 
when longevity, imbued with the technological, becomes a reflexive practice and 
an object of intervention and apparent choice?

BACKGROUND: The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is a pioneering attempt to 
improve the quality of primary care in the UK through the use of financial 
rewards. Despite its achievements, there are concerns that the QOF may offer 
poor value for money.
AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of QOF payments.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Economic analysis.
SETTING: England, UK.
METHOD: Cost-effectiveness evidence was identified for a subset of nine QOF 
indicators with a direct therapeutic impact. These data were then applied to an 
analytic framework to determine the conditions under which QOF payments would be 
cost-effective. This framework was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of QOF payments by modelling the incentive structure using cost-effectiveness 
thresholds of 20 000 and 30 000 UK pounds per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained, to represent good value to the NHS. It used 2004/2005 data on the QOF 
performance of all English primary care practices.
RESULTS: Average indicator payments ranged from 0.63 to 40.61 UK pounds per 
patient, and the percentage of eligible patients treated ranged from 63% to 90%. 
The proportional changes required for QOF payments to be cost-effective varied 
widely between the indicators. Although most indicators required only a fraction 
of a 1% change to be cost-effective, for some indicators improvements in 
performance of around 20% were needed.
CONCLUSION: For most indicators that can be assessed, QOF incentive payments are 
likely to be a cost-effective use of resources for a high proportion of primary 
care practices, even if the QOF achieves only modest improvements in care. 
However, only a small subset of the indicators has been considered, and no 
account has been taken of the costs of administering the QOF scheme.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic sleep deprivation is increasing in modern 
societies with negative health consequences. Recently, an association between 
short sleep and obesity has been reported.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of increasing sleep duration to a 
healthy length (approximately 7(1/2) h) and to determine the effect of sleep 
extension on body weight.
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term effects of sleep extension on 
endocrine (leptin and ghrelin) and immune (cytokines) parameters, the prevalence 
of metabolic syndrome, body composition, psychomotor vigilance, mood, and 
quality of life.
METHODS: One hundred-fifty obese participants who usually sleep less than 6(1/2) 
h, are being randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either an Intervention or to a 
Comparison Group. They are stratified by age (above and below 35) and the 
presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. During the first 12 months (Efficacy 
Phase) of the study, participants are evaluated at bi-monthly intervals: the 
Intervention Group is coached to increase sleep by at least 30-60 min/night, 
while the Comparison Group maintains baseline sleep duration. In the second 
(Effectiveness) phase, participants converge into the same group and are asked 
to increase (Comparison Group) or maintain (Intervention Group) sleep duration 
and are evaluated at 6-month intervals for an additional 3 years. 
Non-pharmacological and behavior-based interventions are being utilized to 
increase sleep duration. Endocrine, metabolic, and psychological effects are 
monitored. The sleep, energy expenditure, and caloric intake are assessed by 
activity monitors and food recall questionnaires. At yearly intervals, body 
composition, abdominal fat, and basal metabolic rate are measured by dual energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), computerized tomography (CT), and indirect 
calorimetry, respectively.
RESULTS: As of January 2010, 109 participants had been randomized, 64 to the 
Intervention Group and 45 to the Comparison Group (76% women, 62% minorities, 
average age: 40.8 years; BMI: 38.5 kg/m(2)). Average sleep duration at screening 
was less than 6 h/night, 40.3 h/week. A total of 28 Intervention and 22 
Comparison participants had completed the Efficacy Phase.
LIMITATIONS: The study is not blinded and the sample size is relatively small.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study on a randomized sample will assess 
whether sleep extension is feasible and whether it influences BMI. Clinical 
Trials 2010; 7: 274-285. http://ctj.sagepub.com.

AIMS: To consider the complex interrelationships between work and health among 
older men, drawing out the importance of considering gender difference in 
approaches to occupational medicine.
METHODS: The method used in the literature search was to review national and 
international research published in English since 1990 on the health and work of 
older men. Journal articles were the primary source. Databases used included Web 
of Science, CSA Illumina Social Sciences, CINAHL, Medline and ANGINFO.
RESULTS: The review of the evidence was structured in terms of key themes 
emerging from the literature into which issues of gender, ethnicity, age and 
socio-economic inequalities were cross cut. The current paper now focuses on two 
of those themes that have particular relevance to occupational medicine: 
work-caused and work-related ill-health, and secondly promoting workplace 
health. It begins by setting the scene with a profile of older men in the labour 
market.
CONCLUSIONS: Two key themes emerge from the review, which are of particular 
significance. One is the central role that work plays in the lives and identity 
of men and therefore the impact this has on their health, both in and out of 
work. Secondly, the occupational histories of men expose them to work-related 
and work-caused ill-health, which has consequences for life expectancy and 
chronic disease in old age. These findings have implications for future 
research, policy formulation and implementation, and for public health practice.

Who should be saved when health resources are limited? Although bioethicists and 
policymakers continue to debate which metric should be used to evaluate health 
interventions, public policy is also subject to public opinion. We investigated 
how the public values life when evaluating vaccine-allocation policies during a 
flu epidemic. We found that people's ratings of the acceptability of policies 
were dramatically influenced by question framing. When policies were described 
in terms of lives saved, people judged them on the basis of the number of life 
years gained. In contrast, when the policies were described in terms of lives 
lost, people considered the age of the policy's beneficiaries, taking into 
account the number of years lived to prioritize young targets for the health 
intervention. In addition, young targets were judged as more valuable in 
general, but young participants valued young targets even more than older 
participants did.

Hypertension update and cardiovascular risk reduction in physically active 
individuals and athletes.

Oliveira LP(1), Lawless CE.

Author information:
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, 
USA.

Hypertension is a prevalent disease worldwide. Its inadequate treatment leads to 
major cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
heart failure. These conditions decrease life expectancy and are a substantial 
cost burden to health care systems. Physically active individuals and 
professional athletes are not risk free for developing this condition. Although 
the percentage of persons affected is substantially lower than the general 
population, these individuals still need to be thoroughly evaluated and blood 
pressure targets monitored to allow safe competitive sports participation. 
Regarding treatment, lifestyle modification measures should be routinely
