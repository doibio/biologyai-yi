BACKGROUND: Around the world, advances in public health and changes in clinical 
interventions have resulted in increased life expectancy. Multimorbidity is 
becoming more of an issue, particularly in countries where the population is 
rapidly ageing. We aimed to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity and 
disease-specific multimorbidity and examine its association with demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics among older adults in India and its states.
METHODS: The individual data from the longitudinal ageing study in India (LASI) 
were used for this study, with 11 common chronic conditions among older adults 
aged 60 and above years (N = 31,464). Descriptive statistics were used to report 
the overall prevalence of multimorbidity and disease-specific burden of 
multimorbidity. Multinomial logistic regression has been used to explore the 
factors associated with multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Prevalence of single morbidity was 30.3%, and multimorbidity was 32.1% 
among older people in India. Multimorbidity was higher among females and in 
urban areas and increased with age and among those living alone. Hypertension, 
arthritis and thyroid were highly prevalent among females and chronic lung 
diseases and stroke were highly prevalent among males. The older people in the 
state of Kerala had a high prevalence of multimorbidity (59.2%). Multimorbidity 
was found to be more likely in older age groups of 75-79 years (RR-1.69; CI: 
1.53-1.87) and 80 years and above (RR-1.40; CI: 1.27-1.56) and in the Western 
(RR-2.16; CI: 1.90-2.44) and Southern regions (RR-2.89; CI: 2.57-3.24). Those 
who were living with a spouse (RR-1.60; CI: 1.15-2.23) were more likely to have 
multimorbidity. Disease-specific multimorbidity was high in chronic heart 
disease (91%) and low in angina (64.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that multimorbidity has a positive 
relationship with advancing age, and disease-specific burden of multimorbidity 
is higher among chronic heart patients. Comorbidity, especially among those who 
already have chronic heart disease, stroke, cholesterol or thyroid disorder can 
have severe consequences on physical functioning, therefore, disease-specific 
health management needs to be enhanced.

IMPORTANCE: People with mental illness have a reduced life expectancy, but the 
extent of the mortality gap and the contribution of natural and unnatural causes 
to excess mortality among people with mental illness in South Africa are 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify excess mortality due to natural and unnatural causes 
associated with mental illness.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study using reimbursement claims and 
vital registration of beneficiaries of a South African medical insurance scheme, 
aged 15-84 years and covered by medical insurance at any point between January 
1, 2011, and June 30, 2020.
EXPOSURES: ICD-10 diagnoses of mental disorders including organic, substance 
use, psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, personality, and developmental disorders.
OUTCOMES: Mortality from natural, unnatural, unknown and all causes, as measured 
by the life-years lost (LYL) metric.
RESULTS: We followed 1 070 183 beneficiaries (51.7% female, median age 36.1 
years for a median duration of 3.0 years, of whom 282 926 (26.4%) received 
mental health diagnoses and 27 640 (2.6%) died. Life expectancy of people with 
mental health diagnoses was 3.83 years (95% CI 3.58-4.10) shorter for men and 
2.19 years (1.97-2.41) shorter for women. Excess mortality varied by sex and 
diagnosis, ranging from 11.50 LYL (95% CI 9.79-13.07) among men with alcohol use 
disorder to 0.87 LYL (0.40-1.43) among women with generalised anxiety disorder. 
Most LYL were attributable to natural causes (3.42 among men and 1.94 among 
women). A considerable number of LYL were attributable to unnatural causes among 
men with bipolar (1.52) or substance use (2.45) disorder.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The burden of premature mortality among persons with 
mental disorders in South Africa is high. Our findings support implementing 
interventions for prevention, early detection, and treatment of physical 
comorbidities among people with mental disorders. Suicide prevention and 
substance use treatment programmes are needed to reduce excess mortality from 
unnatural causes, especially among men.
KEY POINTS: Question: How much shorter is the life expectancy of people with 
mental illness compared to the general population and how many life years are 
lost due to natural and unnatural causes of death?Findings: The life expectancy 
of people with mental health diagnoses was 3.83 years shorter for men and 2.19 
years shorter for women. Most excess life years lost were attributable to 
natural causes (3.42 among men and 1.94 among women). However, bipolar and 
substance use disorders were associated with considerable premature mortality 
from unnatural causes.Meaning: Our findings support the implementation of 
interventions for improving the physical health of people with mental illness 
and targeted suicide prevention and substance use treatment programmes.

To develop multi-antioxidant systems for the preservation of meat products, 
mixtures of essential oils or plant extracts were investigated for their 
antioxidant interactions. The combinatorial study revealed that the chemical 
diversity of both major and minor components of these ingredients contributed to 
the antioxidant interactions. A shift from antagonistic or additive interaction 
to synergistic one was achieved by modulating the ratio of mono-components of 
multi-antioxidant systems. Mixtures containing oregano/thyme (25/50 of IC50), 
thyme/clove (25/100) and thyme/cinnamon (50/25) oils as well as 
cranberry/rosemary (25/25), cranberry/green tea (25/25), cranberry/apple 
(25/25), rosemary/apple (50/25) and grapeseed/cranberry (50/50) extracts have 
shown synergistic antioxidant effects. Among the investigated systems, 
thyme/clove oils and oregano/thyme oils/grape-seed extract systems have 
extended, in situ, the shelf-life of chicken and ground pork products stored at 
4 °C by 2 to 4 folds. The sensory acceptability of treated samples was rated to 
be moderately better than control. This study lays the ground for the 
development of efficient natural multi-antioxidant systems.

BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians are a growing age group in patients undergoing 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR); however, the appropriate use of 
TAVR in this population remains discussed because of their limited life 
expectancy and worse outcome reported.
OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and the 
prognostic impact of nonagenarians.
METHODS: We analyzed consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR and were 
registered in the nationwide registry for TAVR in Japan (Japanese Transcatheter 
Valvular Therapies registry) between 2013 and 2018. The rate of 30-day and 
1-year mortality and composite adverse event, comprising all-cause death, all 
stroke, and life-threatening/major bleeding, were assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 15,028 registered patients during the study period, 2,215 
(14.7%) were nonagenarians. Although the nonagenarians were less likely to have 
comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus and malignancy) than patients aged 
<90 y, they had a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score (8.8% vs 5.6%), 
mainly owing to their advanced age. The procedural characteristics were 
identical between 2 groups. The rate of 30-day mortality and composite endpoint 
was similar, whereas 1-year mortality and composite adverse events were 
increased among nonagenarians (10.3% vs 6.8% and 13.5% vs 9.2%, respectively), 
and nonagenarians were independently associated with these endpoints (HR: 1.21; 
95% CI: 1.03-1.42; P = 0.023; HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07-1.42; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Of the 15,028 TAVR procedures performed in Japan between 2013 and 
2018, 14.7% were performed in nonagenarians. These patients were carefully 
selected by a multidisciplinary heart team and showed 21% and 24% increase of 
1-year mortality and composite adverse outcome.

PURPOSE: Currently, information on the psychometric properties of the Medical 
outcomes study-social support survey (MOS-SSS) for patients with chronic disease 
in primary health care, suggests problems in the dimensionality, specifically 
predominant unidimensionality in a multidimensional measure. The aim of this 
study was to determine the internal structure (dimensionality, measurement 
invariance and reliability) and association with other variables.
METHODS: A total of 470 patients with chronic disease from a Family Medicine 
Unit at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS, with a mean age of 51.51 
years were included. Participants responded to the Questionnaire of 
Sociodemographic Variables (Q-SV), SF-36 Health-Related Quality of Life 
Scale-version 1.1, and MOS-SSS.
RESULTS: Non-parametric (Mokken scaling analysis) and parametric (confirmatory 
factor analysis) analyses indicated unidimensionality, and three-factor model 
was not representative. A new 8-item version (MOS-S) was developed, where 
measurement invariance, equivalence with the long version, reliability, and 
relationship with the SF-36 were satisfactory.
CONCLUSION: The MOS-SSS scale is unidimensional, and the shortened version 
yields valid and reliable scores for measuring social support in patients with 
chronic disease at the primary health care.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant cancer that reduces life expectancy 
worldwide. Although treatment strategies have improved, patients with GC still 
have poor prognoses. Hence, it is necessary to understand the molecular 
mechanisms of GC and to find new therapeutic targets. Mitochondrial dynamics and 
mitochondrial dysfunction are associated with cancer cell growth and 
progression. Numerous studies have reported that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can 
participate in the occurrence and development of GC by regulating mitochondrial 
dynamics. Elucidating the crosstalk between ncRNAs and mitochondria would be 
helpful in preventing and treating GC. Herein, we review and summarize the 
functions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in suppressing ncRNAs and 
regulating mitochondrial dynamics in GC tumor growth, proliferation, invasion 
and metastasis. This review provides new insights into the pathogenesis of and 
intervention for GC.

School dropout is a structural problem which permanently penalizes students and 
society in areas such as low qualification jobs, higher poverty levels and lower 
life expectancy, lower pensions, and higher economic burden for governments. 
Given these high consequences and the surge of the problem due to COVID-19 
pandemic, in this paper we propose a methodology to design, develop, and 
evaluate a machine learning model for predicting dropout in school systems. In 
this methodology, we introduce necessary steps to develop a robust model to 
estimate the individual risk of each student to drop out of school. As 
advancement from previous research, this proposal focuses on analyzing 
individual trajectories of students, incorporating the student situation at 
school, family, among other levels, changes, and accumulation of events to 
predict dropout. Following the methodology, we create a model for the Chilean 
case based on data available mostly through administrative data from the 
educational system, and according to known factors associated with school 
dropout. Our results are better than those from previous research with a 
relevant sample size, with a predictive capability 20% higher for the actual 
dropout cases. Also, in contrast to previous work, the including non-individual 
dimensions results in a substantive contribution to the prediction of leaving 
school. We also illustrate applications of the model for Chilean case to support 
public policy decision making such as profiling schools for qualitative studies 
of pedagogic practices, profiling students' dropout trajectories and simulating 
scenarios.

The advancement of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) treatment improves the 
life expectancy of HIV-positive individuals. People living with HIV have more 
polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions than those without HIV. Integrase strand 
transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are the newest class commonly used for HIV 
treatment. There are five INSTIs currently approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration, including raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, 
and cabotegravir. INSTIs class contributes to better safety and efficacy 
profile, making them the preferred or recommended antiretroviral regimens in HIV 
treatment guidelines worldwide. Despite the shared mechanism of action, INSTIs 
differ in pharmacokinetics, contributing to different drug-drug interactions. 
This review summarized the potential drug interactions of INSTIs and the 
management of the drug interactions in clinical practice.

Publisher: Il progresso dei trattamenti per il virus dell’immunodeficien-za 
umana (HIV) ha migliorato l’aspettativa di vita delle persone HIV-positive, che 
presentano però politerapia e quindi probabilità di interazioni tra farmaci più 
frequentemente rispetto alle persone che vivono senza HIV. Gli inibitori 
dell’attività di strand trasfer dell’integrasi (INSTI) sono la classe più 
recente di farmaci comunemente usati per il trattamento dell’HIV. Attualmente ci 
sono cinque INSTI approvati dalla Food and Drug Administration e da European 
Medicine Agency, cioè raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir e 
cabotegravir. La classe degli INSTI contribuisce a un miglior profilo di 
sicurezza ed efficacia, rendendoli parte dei regimi preferiti o raccomandati per 
il trattamento di HIV nelle linee guida di tutto il modo. Nonostante il 
meccanismo d’azione comune, gli INSTI sono diversi dal punto di vista 
farmacocinetico, facendo sì che abbiano diverse interazioni con altri 
farmaci.Questa revisione riassume le potenziali interazioni degli INSTI con 
altri farmaci e la loro gestione nella pratica clinica.

Ocular and specifically retinal toxicities of systemic medications are prevalent 
and encompass many disease modalities. For many of these pharmaceuticals, 
established follow-up protocols are in place to ensure timely detection and 
cessation of therapy. However, while for some disorders, cessation of therapy is 
a viable option due to existing treatment alternatives, for some others 
cessation of treatment can be life threatening and/or shorten the patient's life 
expectancy. Such is the case for iron chelating agents used in 
transfusion-dependent patients of Thalassemia, of which deferoxamine (DFO) is 
the most widely used. In their recent article in EMBO Molecular Medicine, Kong 
et al (2023) addressed the issue of DFO-induced retinal toxicity used both 
in vivo and in vitro techniques. Their study suggests a potentially protective 
role for α-ketoglutarate (AKG) supplementation against DFO toxicity.

WHAT IS THIS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY ABOUT? This summary presents the results 
from an ongoing, long-term extension study that followed an earlier study called 
ATTR-ACT. People who took part in this extension study and ATTR-ACT have a type 
of heart disease known as transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM for 
short), which causes heart failure and death. In ATTR-ACT, people took either a 
medicine called tafamidis or a placebo (a pill that looks like the study drug 
but does not contain any active ingredients) for up to 2½ years. So far, in the 
long-term extension study, people have continued taking tafamidis, or switched 
from taking a placebo to tafamidis, for another 2½ years. Researchers looked at 
how many people died in ATTR-ACT and the extension study. The long-term 
extension study is expected to end in 2027, so these are interim (not final) 
results.
WHAT DID RESEARCHERS FIND OUT? In the extension study of ATTR-ACT, the risk of 
dying was lower in people who took tafamidis continuously throughout ATTR-ACT 
and the extension study than in people who took placebo in ATTR-ACT and switched 
to tafamidis in the extension study.
WHAT DO THE RESULTS MEAN? Taking tafamidis increases how long people with 
ATTR-CM live. People with ATTR-CM who take tafamidis early and continuously are 
more likely to live longer than those who do not. These results highlight the 
importance of early detection and treatment in people with ATTR-CM. Clinical

INTRODUCTION: Available evidence on favorable nutritional factors for preventing 
osteoporosis remains controversial. Considering the recent increases in life 
expectancy, we investigated the relationship between incident osteoporotic 
fractures and dietary habits in early and late postmenopausal phase women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were Japanese postmenopausal outpatients 
recruited at a primary care institution in Nagano Prefecture (Nagano Cohort 
Study). Patients with critical or acute illness or secondary osteoporosis were 
not included in this study. In total, 1,071 participants were prospectively 
followed for a mean of 5.8 years. The cohort was divided into early (≤ 70 years) 
and late (> 70 years) postmenopausal phases based on median age. Dietary 
nutrient intake was estimated by the food frequency questionnaire method. 
According to baseline nutrient intake characteristics, we focused on 
protein/energy and Ca/NaCl intake ratios, which were also divided by the median 
values.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier plots revealed a significantly higher occurrence of 
fractures for the high protein/energy intake group in early postmenopausal 
subjects (P = 0.009), whereas the low Ca/NaCl intake group in late 
postmenopausal subjects exhibited a significantly earlier occurrence of 
fractures (P = 0.002). Multivariate Cox regression uncovered significant 
independent risks of higher protein/energy (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.04-1.74) and lower 
Ca/NaCl (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.99) intake ratios for incident osteoporotic 
fractures in the early and late postmenopausal cohorts, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Distinct dietary risk factors for osteoporotic fractures were 
identified in early and late postmenopausal phase women. Appropriate nutritional 
guidance according to patient age will be important for maintaining bone health 
and quality of life.

The hip joint helps the upper body to transfer its weight to lower body. Along 
with age, there are various reasons for the degeneration of the hip joint. The 
artificial hip implant replaces the degenerated hip. Wear between the joints is 
the primary cause of the hip implant becoming loose. The wear can occur due to 
various reasons. Due to this revision surgery are most common in young and 
active patients. In the design phase of the implant if this is taken care then 
life expectancy of the implant can be improved. Small design changes can 
significantly enhance the implant's life. In this work, elliptical-shaped hip 
implant stem is designed, and linear wear is estimated at trunnion junction. In 
this work, a 28 mm diameter femoral head with a 4 mm thick acetabular cup and a 
2 mm thick backing cup is used. The top surface taper radiuses are changed. 
Solid works was used to create the models. Ansys was used to perform the 
analysis. It was found that as the radius of the TTR decreased, the wear rate 
decreased. The least wear rate was found in 12/14 mm taper with a value of 
1.15E-02mm year-1for the first material combination and with a value of 
1.23E-02mm year-1for the second material combination. In the comparison between 
the models with 1 mm chamfer and no chamfer, it was found that the wear rate was 
lower for the models with 1 mm chamfer. When the chamfer was increased (more 
than 1 mm), the linear wear increased. Wear is the main reason for the loosening 
of hip implants, which leads to a revision of an implant. It was found that with 
a decrease in TTR, there was a small increase in the linear wear rate. Overall, 
the implant with TTR 6 mm and a chamfer of 1 mm was found to have the least wear 
rate. To validate these results, the implant can be 3D printed and tested on a 
hip simulator.

BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of premature deaths globally are related to 
metabolic diseases in young adults. We examined the global trends and mortality 
of metabolic diseases in individuals aged below 40 years using data from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
METHODS: From 2000 to 2019, global estimates of deaths and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) were described for metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes 
mellitus [T2DM], hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease [NAFLD]). Subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, 
geographical regions and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI). Age-standardised death 
and DALYs were presented per 100,000 population with 95 % uncertainty intervals 
(UI). Projections of mortality and DALYs were estimated using regression models 
based on the GBD 2019 data and combining them with Institute for Health Metrics 
and Evaluation projection counts for years up to 2050.
RESULTS: In 2019, the highest age-standardised death rates were observed in 
hypertension (133·88 [121·25-155·73]), followed by obesity (62·59 
[39·92-89·13]), hyperlipidemia (56·51 [41·83-73·62]), T2DM (18·49 [17·18-19·66]) 
and NAFLD (2·09 [1·61-2·60]). Similarly, obesity (1932·54 [1276·61-2639·74]) had 
the highest age-standardised DALYs, followed by hypertension (2885·57 
[2580·75-3201·05]), hyperlipidemia (1207·15 [975·07-1461·11]), T2DM (801·55 
[670·58-954·43]) and NAFLD (53·33 [40·73-68·29]). Mortality rates decreased over 
time in hyperlipidemia (-0·6 %), hypertension (-0·47 %), NAFLD (-0·31 %) and 
T2DM (-0·20 %), but not in obesity (1·07 % increase). The highest 
metabolic-related mortality was observed in Eastern Mediterranean and low SDI 
countries. By 2050, obesity is projected to contribute to the largest number of 
deaths (102·8 % increase from 2019), followed by hypertension (61·4 % increase), 
hyperlipidemia (60·8 % increase), T2DM (158·6 % increase) and NAFLD (158·4 % 
increase), with males continuing to bear the greatest burden across all 
metabolic diseases.
CONCLUSION: The growing burden of metabolic diseases, increasing obesity-related 
mortality trends, and the sex-regional-socioeconomic disparities evident in 
young adulthood, underlie the concerning growing global burden of metabolic 
diseases now and in future.

Previous studies have demonstrated that high physiological levels of reactive 
oxygen species induce pupal diapause and extend lifespan in the moth Helicoverpa 
armigera. This has been shown to occur via protein arginine methyltransferase 1 
(PRMT1) blockade of Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor 
FoxO, after which activated FoxO promotes the initiation of diapause. However, 
it is unclear how PRMT1 is activated upstream of FoxO activity. Here, we show 
that high reactive oxygen species levels in the brains of H. armigera 
diapause-destined pupae activate the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, 
which subsequently activates the transcription factor cAMP-response element 
binding protein. We show that cAMP-response element binding protein then 
directly binds to the PRMT1 promoter and upregulates its expression to prevent 
Akt-mediated FoxO phosphorylation and downstream FoxO nuclear localization. This 
novel finding that c-Jun N-terminal kinase promotes FoxO nuclear localization in 
a PRMT1-dependent manner to regulate pupal diapause reveals a complex regulatory 
mechanism in extending the healthspan of H. armigera.

BACKGROUND: Old age is associated with increased co-morbidities, resulting in 
reduced life expectancy. Primary endocrine therapy is an alternative to primary 
surgical therapy for patients with breast cancer and increased co-morbidities. 
The aim was to review outcomes of primary endocrine therapy versus primary 
surgical therapy in older women with breast cancer.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched 
systematically from January 2000 to May 2022. Single-arm studies were excluded. 
Primary outcomes were overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. 
Secondary outcomes were local and regional failure of primary endocrine therapy, 
recurrence after primary surgical therapy, and health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: There were 14 studies including 14 254 patients (primary endocrine 
therapy 2829, 19.8 per cent; primary surgical therapy 11 425, 80.2 per cent), 
with the addition of four major studies (9538 patients) compared with the latest 
review in 2014. Seven studies defined primary surgical therapy as surgery plus 
adjuvant endocrine therapy, and six studies included patients with oestrogen 
receptor-positive tumours only. Patients in the primary endocrine therapy group 
were older than the primary surgical therapy group (mean difference 2.43 (95 per 
cent c.i. 0.73 to 4.13) years). Primary endocrine therapy led to worse overall 
survival than primary surgical therapy (HR 1.42, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 1.91). 
Subgroup analysis of RCTs and prospective studies, however, showed comparable 
overall survival. Breast cancer-specific survival was also comparable (HR 1.28, 
95 per cent c.i. 0.87 to 1.87). At 6 weeks, operated patients had significant 
arm symptoms and illness burden following major breast surgery compared with 
patients receiving primary endocrine therapy. Health-related quality of life, 
measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
QLQ-C30 and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L™, was comparable in the two treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: Overall survival was worse among older women receiving primary 
endocrine therapy in an analysis including all studies, but comparable in RCTs 
and prospective studies. This may be due to confounding by age and 
co-morbidities in retrospective cohort studies of primary endocrine therapy.

WHAT IS THIS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY ABOUT? This plain language summary describes 
the results of a study looking at the effects of a medicine called ARRY-371797 
(also known as PF-07265803) in people with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM for 
short) caused by a faulty LMNA gene. This condition is called LMNA-related DCM. 
DCM happens when the heart becomes bigger and weaker than normal, impacting 
functional capacity and leading to symptoms of heart failure. This means the 
heart is not able to pump blood around the body as easily, and people are unable 
to do as much in their daily lives (like getting dressed and going shopping). 
People may inherit a faulty LMNA gene from one of their parents, or a faulty 
LMNA gene may develop when mistakes happen during cell growth and replication. 
ARRY-371797 targets a specific mechanism in the body that can lead to heart 
problems in people with a faulty LMNA gene. As ARRY-371797 is not currently 
approved for use outside of clinical trials, it doesn't currently have an easily 
recognizable trade name.
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS? 12 American people (average age 50 years) with 
LMNA-related DCM took part in the study and received 400 mg or 100 mg of 
ARRY-371797 twice daily for 48 weeks. People knew which dose of ARRY-371797 they 
were taking. People were checked after 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of taking 
ARRY-371797 to see how far they could walk in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT for 
short). The level of NT-proBNP in their blood was also measured. NT-proBNP is a 
biomarker used to measure the severity of heart failure. A biomarker is 
something found in the body that can be measured to indicate the extent of a 
disease. -After taking ARRY-371797 for 12 weeks, people were able to walk 
further in the 6MWT and had lower levels of NT-proBNP in their blood. This 
suggests improvement in functional capacity (exercise tolerance) and heart 
function. Researchers also asked people about their quality of life using the 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ for short), and looked for any 
side effects. -Researchers saw some improvement in KCCQ scores. -Researchers saw 
no major side effects that they considered to be related to ARRY-371797 
treatment. A side effect is something that people feel was caused by a medicine 
or treatment. Overall, this study showed that people with LMNA-related DCM who 
took ARRY-371797 had improved functional capacity (exercise tolerance), improved 
heart function, and improved quality of life. Phase 2 study (NCT02057341) Phase 
2 long-term extension study (NCT02351856) Phase 3 REALM-DCM study (NCT03439514).
