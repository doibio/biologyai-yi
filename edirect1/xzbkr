BACKGROUND: The performance of the Beta Binomial (BB) model is compared with 
several existing models for mapping the EORTC QLQ-C30 (QLQ-C30) on to the 
EQ-5D-3L using data from lung cancer trials.
METHODS: Data from 2 separate non small cell lung cancer clinical trials 
(TOPICAL and SOCCAR) are used to develop and validate the BB model. Comparisons 
with Linear, TOBIT, Quantile, Quadratic and CLAD models are carried out. The 
mean prediction error, R(2), proportion predicted outside the valid range, 
clinical interpretation of coefficients, model fit and estimation of Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALY) are reported and compared. Monte-Carlo simulation is 
also used.
RESULTS: The Beta-Binomial regression model performed 'best' among all models. 
For TOPICAL and SOCCAR trials, respectively, residual mean square error (RMSE) 
was 0.09 and 0.11; R(2) was 0.75 and 0.71; observed vs. predicted means were 
0.612 vs. 0.608 and 0.750 vs. 0.749. Mean difference in QALY's (observed vs. 
predicted) were 0.051 vs. 0.053 and 0.164 vs. 0.162 for TOPICAL and SOCCAR 
respectively. Models tested on independent data show simulated 95% confidence 
from the BB model containing the observed mean more often (77% and 59% for 
TOPICAL and SOCCAR respectively) compared to the other models. All algorithms 
over-predict at poorer health states but the BB model was relatively better, 
particularly for the SOCCAR data.
CONCLUSION: The BB model may offer superior predictive properties amongst 
mapping algorithms considered and may be more useful when predicting EQ-5D-3L at 
poorer health states. We recommend the algorithm derived from the TOPICAL data 
due to better predictive properties and less uncertainty.

Dental fast track: prenatal enamel growth, incisor eruption, and weaning in 
human infants.

University of Kent, Canterbury, CT2 7NR, UK.

Correlation between the timing of permanent first molar eruption and weaning age 
in extant primates has provided a way to infer a life history event in fossil 
species, but recent debate has questioned whether the same link is present in 
human infants. Deciduous incisors erupt at an age when breast milk can be 
supplemented with additional foods (mixed feeding), and weaning is typically 
complete before permanent first molars erupt. Here, I use histological methods 
to calculate the prenatal rate by which enamel increases in thickness and height 
on human deciduous incisors, canines, and molars (n = 125). Growth trajectories 
for each tooth type are related to the trimesters and assessed against the 
eruption sequence and final crown height. Analyses show that central incisors 
initiate early in the second trimester with significantly faster secretion rates 
relative to canines and second molars, which initiate closer to birth. Even 
though initial extension rates were correlated with crown height and scaled with 
positive allometry within each tooth class, the relatively short incisors still 
increased in height at a significantly faster rate than the taller canines and 
molars. The incisor prenatal "fast track" produces a greater proportion of the 
crown before birth than all other tooth types. This growth mechanism likely 
facilitates early incisor eruption at a time when the mixed feeding of infants 
can be initiated as part of the weaning process. Findings provide a basis from 
which to explore new links between developmental trends along the tooth row and 
mixed feeding age in other primates.

[Palliative care and chronic heart failure].

[Article in Czech]

Vítovec J, Kabelka L, Spinarová L, Spinar J.

Heart failure is a very common clinical syndrome in cardiology which reduces 
life expectancy and has a significant impact on the quality of life. The 
treatment of heart failure improves survival thus the number of patients who 
reach the terminal state increases with this diagnosis. Major symptoms and 
psychosocial difficulties begin to appear during therapy which aims to prolong 
life or cure the life limiting illnesses. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
changed its definition in 2002 and concluded that palliative care should be 
provided "in the early stages of disease, together with another treatment that 
prolongs life." Palliative care involves multiple disciplines in order to solve 
problems caused by the symptoms of the disease and other related aspects of the 
patient and family who are considered as a one subject, because a feeling of 
well-being has an impact on others.Key words: heart failure - 
non-pharmacological treatment - palliative care.

BACKGROUND: Both supervised exercise (SE) and stenting (ST) improve functional 
status, symptoms, and quality of life compared with optimal medical care (OMC) 
in patients with claudication. The relative cost-effectiveness of these 
strategies is not well defined.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Claudication: Exercise Versus Endoluminal 
Revascularization (CLEVER) study randomized patients with claudication due to 
aortoiliac stenosis to a 6-month SE program, to ST, or to OMC. Participants who 
completed 6-month follow-up (n=98) were included in a health economic analysis 
through 18 months. Costs were assessed using resource-based methods and hospital 
billing data. Quality-adjusted life-years were estimated using the EQ-5D. Markov 
modeling based on the in-trial results was used to explore the impact of 
assumptions about the longer term durability of observed differences in quality 
of life. Through 18 months, mean healthcare costs were $5178, $9804, and $14 590 
per patient for OMC, SE, and ST, respectively. Measured quality-adjusted 
life-years through 18 months were 1.04, 1.16, and 1.20. In our base case 
analysis, which assumed that observed differences in quality of life would 
dissipate after 5 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $24 070 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained for SE versus OMC, $41 376 for ST versus 
OMC, and $122 600 for ST versus SE. If the treatment effect of ST was assumed to 
be more durable than that of SE, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ST 
versus SE became more favorable.
CONCLUSIONS: Both SE and ST are economically attractive by US standards relative 
to OMC for the treatment of claudication in patients with aortoiliac disease. ST 
is more expensive than SE, with uncertain incremental benefit.

Microstructural alterations of trabecular and cortical bone in long-term 
HIV-infected elderly men on successful antiretroviral therapy.

Biver E, Calmy A, Delhumeau C, Durosier C, Zawadynski S, Rizzoli R.

OBJECTIVE: Progress in antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in an almost 
normal life expectancy for HIV-infected individuals, but an increased risk of 
fragility fractures has been identified. We investigated the influence of 
long-term HIV infection on successful ART on bone microstructure in elderly men.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional, case–control study.
METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral 
quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) were performed in 28 HIV-positive men 
between 60 and 70 years old on successful ART. Controls were 112 HIV-negative 
men matched for age 4 years and BMI (4 kg/ m²).
RESULTS: HIV-positive men (median CD4þ cell count, 589 cells/ml; BMI, 24.8 
kg/m²) had a median duration of HIV infection of 18.2 years. Compared with 
HIV-negative men, they had a lower DXA-measured areal bone mineral density at 
total hip (3.2%, P¼0.050) and ultra-distal radius (8.4%, P¼0.001). At distal 
radius and tibia, we observed microstructural alterations with a lower total 
density (16%, P¼ 0.005 and 14.3%, P¼ 0.039), trabecular density (11.6%, P¼ 0.012 
and 12.2%, P¼ 0.007) and cortical area (17.5%, P¼ 0.002 and 12.2%, P¼ 0.01). In 
addition, they had a lower trabecular number (P¼ 0.036), higher trabecular 
spacing (P¼ 0.027) and lower cortical thickness (19.9%; P¼ 0.008) at distal 
radius. beta-crosslaps (CTX) and vitamin D levels were higher than in controls. 
By multivariate analyses, HIV status, higher CTX levels, lower physical activity 
and estradiol levels were determinants of bone density and microstructure 
alterations.
CONCLUSION: HIV-infected elderly men on successful ART have trabecular and 
cortical bone microstructure alterations associated with higher bone resorption, 
despite adequate vitamin D supplementation.

Ageing individuals and ageing populations.

[Article in English, Polish]

Zieliński A.

Public health problems associated with ageing, due to its complexity, enters the 
spheres of interests in many fields: demography, economics, and politics. In 
many countries challenges related to the increasing number of people at 
retirement age remain strongly dependent on the actual and projected numbers of 
people at productive age emerging from the demographic condition of the 
population. The article addresses the complexity of the relations between life 
expectancy, healthy life expectancy and the length of life in disability. 
Underlined are the social and economic conditions of life in the period of the 
old age, including the problem of inequalities in health and the role of 
research in the field of public health for the proper recognition of the problem 
and rational planning of resource allocation and organizational measures aimed 
at meeting social expectations associated with ageing.

A continuous labour supply model in microsimulation: a life-cycle modelling 
approach with heterogeneity and uncertainty extension.

This paper advances a structural inter-temporal model of labour supply that is 
able to simulate the dynamics of labour supply in a continuous setting and 
addresses two main drawbacks of most existing models. The first limitation is 
the inability to incorporate individual heterogeneity as every agent is sharing 
the same parameters of the utility function. The second one is the strong 
assumption that individuals make decisions in a world of perfect certainty. 
Essentially, this paper offers an extension of 
marginal-utility-of-wealth-constant labour supply functions known as "Frisch 
functions" under certainty and uncertainty with homogenous and heterogeneous 
preferences. The lifetime models based on the fixed effect vector decomposition 
yield the most stable simulation results, under both certain and uncertain 
future wage assumptions. Due to its improved accuracy and stability, this 
lifetime labour supply model is particularly suitable for enhancing the 
performance of the life cycle simulation models, thus providing a better 
reference for policymaking.

Why lifespans are more variable among blacks than among whites in the United 
States.

Firebaugh G(1), Acciai F, Noah AJ, Prather C, Nau C.

Author information:
(1), 902 Oswald Tower, University Park, PA, 16802, USA, firebaugh@psu.edu.

Lifespans are both shorter and more variable for blacks than for whites in the 
United States. Because their lifespans are more variable, there is greater 
inequality in length of life-and thus greater uncertainty about the future-among 
blacks. This study is the first to decompose the black-white difference in 
lifespan variability in America. Are lifespans more variable for blacks because 
they are more likely to die of causes that disproportionately strike the young 
and middle-aged, or because age at death varies more for blacks than for whites 
among those who succumb to the same cause? We find that it is primarily the 
latter. For almost all causes of death, age at death is more variable for blacks 
than it is for whites, especially among women. Although some youthful causes of 
death, such as homicide and HIV/AIDS, contribute to the black-white disparity in 
variance, those contributions are largely offset by the higher rates of suicide 
and drug poisoning deaths for whites. As a result, differences in the causes of 
death for blacks and whites account, on net, for only about one-eighth of the 
difference in lifespan variance.

Heterogeneity in expected longevities.

Pijoan-Mas J(1), Ríos-Rull JV.

Author information:
(1)CEMFI, Casado del Alisal 5, 28014, Madrid, Spain, pijoan@cemfi.es.

We develop a new methodology to compute differences in the expected longevity of 
individuals of a given cohort who are in different socioeconomic groups at a 
certain age. We address the two main problems associated with the standard use 
of life expectancy: (1) that people's socioeconomic characteristics change, and 
(2) that mortality has decreased over time. Our methodology uncovers substantial 
heterogeneity in expected longevities, yet much less heterogeneity than what 
arises from the naive application of life expectancy formulae. We decompose the 
longevity differences into differences in health at age 50, differences in the 
evolution of health with age, and differences in mortality conditional on 
health. Remarkably, education, wealth, and income are health-protecting but have 
very little impact on two-year mortality rates conditional on health. Married 
people and nonsmokers, however, benefit directly in their immediate mortality. 
Finally, we document an increasing time trend of the socioeconomic gradient of 
longevity in the period 1992-2008, and we predict an increase in the 
socioeconomic gradient of mortality rates for the coming years.

Negative effect of aging on psychosocial functioning of adults with congenital 
heart disease.

Enomoto J(1), Nakazawa M.

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Letters, Toyo University.

BACKGROUND: Improvements in life expectancy among adults with congenital heart 
disease (ACHD) provide them with unique challenges throughout their lives and 
age-related psychosocial tasks in this group might differ from those of healthy 
counterparts. This study aimed to clarify age-related differences in 
psychosocial functioning in ACHD patients and determine the factors influencing 
anxiety and depression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 133 ACHD patients (aged 20-46) and 117 reference 
participants (aged 20-43) were divided in 2 age groups (20 s and 30 s/40 s) and 
completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Independent-Consciousness 
Scale, and Problem-Solving Inventory. Only ACHD patients completed an illness 
perception inventory. ACHD patients over 30 showed a significantly greater 
percentage of probable anxiety cases than those in their 20 s and the reference 
group. Moreover, ACHD patients over 30 who had lower dependence on parents and 
friends, registered higher independence and problem-solving ability than those 
in their 20 s, whereas this element did not vary with age in the reference 
participants. Furthermore, ACHD patients may develop an increasingly negative 
perception of their illness as they age. The factors influencing anxiety and 
depression in patients were aging, independence, problem-solving ability, and 
NYHA functional class.
CONCLUSIONS: Although healthy people are psychosocially stable after their 20 s, 
ACHD patients experience major differences and face unique challenges even after 
entering adulthood.

[Giant aortic arch aneurysm following ligation of patent ductus arteriosus in an 
adult patient with Down syndrome; report of a case].

[Article in Japanese]

Tano K(1), Ichikawa Y.

Hospital, Kochi, Japan.

A 45-year-old male with Down syndrome( DS) had abnormal findings pointed out by 
chest X-ray and admitted to our hospital. He had undergone ligation of the 
patent ductus arteriosus 33 years before. Computed tomography showed a giant 
aortic aneurysm at the aortopulmonary window. Aortic arch replacement was 
performed under cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest. The postoperative 
course was uneventful. Postoperative ductal aneurysm in an adult is relatively 
rare and needs early operation because of the high risk of rupture. In this 
case, considering the size of the aneurysm, the timing of diagnosis seemed to be 
late. As the life expectancy of patients with DS has been lengthning recently, 
their regular health examinations is mandatory to improve the life expectancy 
and quality of life.

Two novel polymorphisms of bovine SIRT2 gene are associated with higher body 
weight in Nanyang cattle.

Identification of polymorphisms associated with economic traits is important for 
successful marker-assisted selection in cattle breeding. The family of mammalian 
sirtuin regulates many biological functions, such as life span extension and 
energy metabolism. SIRT2, a most abundant sirtuin in adipocytes, acts as a 
crucial regulator of adipogenic differentiation and plays a key role in 
controlling adipose tissue function and mass. Here we investigated single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bovine SIRT2 in 1226 cattle from five breeds 
and further evaluated the effects of identified SNPs on economically important 
traits of Nanyang cattle. Our results revealed four novel SNPs in bovine SIRT2, 
one was located in intronic region and the other three were synonymous 
mutations. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses based on the identified 
SNPs showed obvious difference between crossbred breed and the other four beef 
breeds. Association analyses demonstrated that SNPs g.17333C > T and 
g.17578A > G have a significantly effect on 18-months-old body weight of Nanyang 
population. Animals with combined genotype TTGG at the above two loci exhibited 
especially higher body weight. Our data for the first time demonstrated that 
polymorphisms in bovine SIRT2 are associated with economic traits of Nanyang 
cattle, which will be helpful for future cattle selection practices.

Brescia, Brescia, Italy.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To assess sensory outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in 
two groups of patients with and without great auricular nerve (GAN) preservation 
during parotidectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
METHODS: The posterior branch of the GAN was preserved in 42 patients (group A) 
and sacrificed in 13 (group B). Tactile, heat, and cold sensitivities were 
investigated by dividing GAN territory into seven areas. Comparisons between 
operated (OS) and nonoperated sides (NS) within each group, and between the OS 
of the two groups were made. The QoL questionnaire was administered.
RESULTS: In group A, normal tactile, heat, and cold sensitivities ranged from 
16.7% to 66.7%, 11.9% to 73.8%, and 21.4% to 81%, respectively, in different OS 
areas. Significant differences between OS and NS were found, except for the 
preauricular superior area. In group B, normal tactile, heat, and cold 
sensitivities ranged from 0% to 61.5%, 0% to 53.8%, and 7.7% to 76.9%, 
respectively, in different OS areas. Significant differences between OS and NS 
were found except for the preauricular superior (tactile sensitivity), and 
preauricular superior and helix/concha areas (cold sensitivity). Comparing the 
OS tactile and thermic sensitivities between the two groups, only the lobule 
area showed differences. The preauricular inferior area was different only for 
heat. The QoL questionnaire showed different hypoesthesia extension between the 
two groups. All other items were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: Sensory deficits are commonly reported despite GAN preservation. 
Lobule and preauricular inferior areas showed differences in terms of tactile 
and thermic sensitivities, with better outcomes in group A. QoL seems tolerable 
despite GAN sacrifice.

Recombination is an essential process in eukaryotes, which increases diversity 
by disrupting genetic linkage between loci and ensures the proper segregation of 
chromosomes during meiosis. In the human genome, recombination events are 
clustered in hotspots, whose location is determined by the PRDM9 protein. There 
is evidence that the location of hotspots evolves rapidly, as a consequence of 
changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domain. However, the reasons for these changes and 
the rate at which they occur are not known. In this study, we investigated the 
evolution of human hotspot loci and of PRDM9 target motifs, both in modern and 
archaic human lineages (Denisovan) to quantify the dynamic of hotspot turnover 
during the recent period of human evolution. We show that present-day human 
hotspots are young: they have been active only during the last 10% of the time 
since the divergence from chimpanzee, starting to be operating shortly before 
the split between Denisovans and modern humans. Surprisingly, however, our 
analyses indicate that Denisovan recombination hotspots did not overlap with 
modern human ones, despite sharing similar PRDM9 target motifs. We further show 
that high-affinity PRDM9 target motifs are subject to a strong self-destructive 
drive, known as biased gene conversion (BGC), which should lead to the loss of 
the majority of them in the next 3 MYR. This depletion of PRDM9 genomic targets 
is expected to decrease fitness, and thereby to favor new PRDM9 alleles binding 
different motifs. Our refined estimates of the age and life expectancy of human 
hotspots provide empirical evidence in support of the Red Queen hypothesis of 
recombination hotspots evolution.

Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are approved for chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) therapy. We evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of seven 
sequential therapy regimens for CML in Austria. A cost-effectiveness analysis 
was performed using a state-transition Markov model. As model parameters, we 
used published trial data, clinical, epidemiological and economic data from the 
Austrian CML registry and national databases. We performed a cohort simulation 
over a life-long time-horizon from a societal perspective. Nilotinib without 
second-line TKI yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio of 121,400 
€/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to imatinib without second-line TKI 
after imatinib failure. Imatinib followed by nilotinib after failure resulted in 
131,100 €/QALY compared to nilotinib without second-line TKI. Nilotinib followed 
by dasatinib yielded 152,400 €/QALY compared to imatinib followed by nilotinib 
after failure. Remaining strategies were dominated. The sequential application 
of TKIs is standard-of-care, and thus, our analysis points toward imatinib 
followed by nilotinib as the most cost-effective strategy.

PURPOSE: To identify when, from the standpoint of relative risk, magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging-based screening may be effective in patients with a known 
or suspected genetic predisposition to pancreatic cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors developed a Markov model of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The model was calibrated to National Cancer Institute 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data and informed by the 
literature. A hypothetical screening strategy was evaluated in which all 
population individuals underwent one-time MR imaging screening at age 50 years. 
Screening outcomes for individuals with an average risk for PDAC ("base case") 
were compared with those for individuals at an increased risk to assess for 
differential benefits in populations with a known or suspected genetic 
predisposition. Effects of varying key inputs, including MR imaging performance, 
surgical mortality, and screening age, were evaluated with a sensitivity 
analysis. RESULTS In the base case, screening resulted in a small number of 
cancer deaths averted (39 of 100 000 men, 38 of 100 000 women) and a net 
decrease in life expectancy (-3 days for men, -4 days for women), which was 
driven by unnecessary pancreatic surgeries associated with false-positive 
results. Life expectancy gains were achieved if an individual's risk for PDAC 
exceeded 2.4 (men) or 2.7 (women) times that of the general population. When 
relative risk increased further, for example to 30 times that of the general 
population, averted cancer deaths and life expectancy gains increased 
substantially (1219 of 100 000 men, life expectancy gain: 65 days; 1204 of 100 
000 women, life expectancy gain: 71 days). In addition, results were sensitive 
to MR imaging specificity and the surgical mortality rate.
CONCLUSION: Although PDAC screening with MR imaging for the entire population is 
not effective, individuals with even modestly increased risk may benefit.

INTRODUCTION: The improvement of antiretroviral therapy in the past decades has 
had a major impact on life expectancy and quality of life of people living with 
HIV, and also on the relationship between patients and their physicians. What 
used to be an acute treatment for life threatening complications, and an 
end-of-life therapy in the beginning of the epidemic, turned over the time into 
a lifelong care. The good relationship between patients and physicians 
represents the cornerstone of an optimal long-term therapy. Shared decision 
making between patients and physicians is a crucial prerequisite for the success 
of this approach. Several Austrian patient organizations developed an online 
survey together with MSD (the so-called "PAB-test") aimed to evaluate how people 
living with HIV perceive the level of care in Austria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey has been developed to evaluate how 
people living with HIV feel about the relationship with their physicians and to 
what extent they feel involved in treatment related decisions.
RESULTS: A total of 303 subjects completed the questionnaire. 44% felt "totally" 
involved in their therapy, 40% "strongly involved", 12% "fairly involved", 3% 
"poorly involved" and 1% "not at all involved" in their therapy. The proportion 
of subjects who felt totally involved in the therapy was equally distributed 
between sex, sexual orientation, age groups, groups of various education level, 
and between patients treated predominantly in intramural or extramural medical 
care. The most important factor for people living with HIV to feel involved in 
their therapy is a low amount of long-term ART-related side-effects (Figure 1).
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the majority of people living with HIV in 
Austria feel involved in therapy related decisions. This proportion is equally 
distributed in patients with different socio-demographic or socio-economic 
characteristics or level of medical care delivery. According to the survey, the 
most important reason for people living with HIV to be involved in their therapy 
is to avoid long-term side effects.

INTRODUCTION: The increased life expectancy of HIV patients in the era of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy has had profound consequences for the healthcare 
systems that provide their care. It is useful to assess whether healthcare 
resources need to be adapted to the different stages of HIV infection or to 
patient characteristics [1]. To study how patient features influence utilization 
of out patient services, we retrospectively analyzed the electronic health 
record of HIV-positive patients who had followed day-care programs at the AIDS 
Center of the University of Palermo, Italy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 223 HIV-infected subjects were recruited and divided into 
two groups according to CD4 cell counts (117 with a CD4 count ≤500/mm(3) and 106 
with CD4 count ≥500/mm(3)). Data on age, gender, race, lifestyle habits 
(including educational level, drug abuse history, smoking status, alcohol 
consumption, sexual behaviour) BMI, HIV-RNA, CD4+ T-cell count, antiretroviral 
therapy (ART), comorbidities such as HCV co-infection, osteoporosis biomarker, 
dyslipidemia, diabetes, renal function and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
were recorded in a purposely designed database and were analyzed in relation to 
AIN by uni- and multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Table 1 shows the characteristics of enrolled patients; the average age 
of the recruited patients was 45.4±9.5 years. 163 individuals were male (73%), 
26 were immigrants (12%) and 91 (40%) were treatment-naïve. Mean day care access 
for laboratory tests to evaluate stage of HIV and for treatment monitoring was 
6.5 days for CD4 cell count measurements and 9.6 for HIV RNA/drug-resistance 
testing. When patients were stratified according to CD4 count, mean day care 
access for laboratory tests to evaluate HIV stage and to monitor treatment was 
negatively correlated with CD4 cell counts.
CONCLUSIONS: Only patients with CD4 counts ≤500/mm(3) showed higher rates of 
healthcare utilization; these data may be useful for monitoring and revising 
implementation plans for the different phases of HIV disease.

PURPOSE: The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) 
recommended that clinical laboratories performing next-generation sequencing 
analyze and return pathogenic variants for 56 specific genes it considered 
medically actionable. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and economic 
impact of returning these results.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic policy model to project the 
quality-adjusted life-years and lifetime costs associated with returning 
ACMG-recommended incidental findings in three hypothetical cohorts of 10,000 
patients.
RESULTS: Returning incidental findings to cardiomyopathy patients, colorectal 
cancer patients, or healthy individuals would increase costs by $896,000, $2.9 
million, and $3.9 million, respectively, and would increase quality-adjusted 
life-years by 20, 25.4, and 67 years, respectively, for incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $44,800, $115,020, and $58,600, respectively. In 
probabilistic analyses, returning incidental findings cost less than 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained in 85, 28, and 91%, respectively, of 
simulations. Assuming next-generation sequencing costs $500, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for primary screening of healthy individuals was 
$133,400 (<$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained in 10% of simulations). 
Results were sensitive to the cohort age and assumptions about gene penetrance.
CONCLUSION: Returning incidental findings is likely cost-effective for certain 
patient populations. Screening of generally healthy individuals is likely not 
cost-effective based on current data, unless next-generation sequencing costs 
less than $500.

BACKGROUND: One of the hallmarks of retroviral life cycle is the efficient and 
specific packaging of two copies of retroviral gRNA in the form of a 
non-covalent RNA dimer by the assembling virions. It is becoming increasingly 
clear that the process of dimerization is closely linked with gRNA packaging, 
and in some retroviruses, the latter depends on the former. Earlier mutational 
analysis of the 5' end of the MMTV genome indicated that MMTV gRNA packaging 
determinants comprise sequences both within the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) 
and the beginning of gag.
RESULTS: The RNA secondary structure of MMTV gRNA packaging sequences was 
elucidated employing selective 2'hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension 
(SHAPE). SHAPE analyses revealed the presence of a U5/Gag long-range interaction 
(U5/Gag LRI), not predicted by minimum free-energy structure predictions that 
potentially stabilizes the global structure of this region. Structure 
conservation along with base-pair covariations between different strains of MMTV 
further supported the SHAPE-validated model. The 5' region of the MMTV gRNA 
contains multiple palindromic (pal) sequences that could initiate intermolecular 
interaction during RNA dimerization. In vitro RNA dimerization, SHAPE analysis, 
and structure prediction approaches on a series of pal mutants revealed that 
MMTV RNA utilizes a palindromic point of contact to initiate intermolecular 
interactions between two gRNAs, leading to dimerization. This contact point 
resides within pal II (5' CGGCCG 3') at the 5' UTR and contains a canonical "GC" 
dyad and therefore likely constitutes the MMTV RNA dimerization initiation site 
(DIS). Further analyses of these pal mutants employing in vivo genetic 
approaches indicate that pal II, as well as pal sequences located in the primer 
binding site (PBS) are both required for efficient MMTV gRNA packaging.
CONCLUSIONS: Employing structural prediction, biochemical, and genetic 
approaches, we show that pal II functions as a primary point of contact between 
two MMTV RNAs, leading to gRNA dimerization and its subsequent encapsidation 
into the assembling virus particles. The results presented here enhance our 
understanding of the MMTV gRNA dimerization and packaging processes and the role 
of structural motifs with respect to RNA-RNA and possibly RNA-protein 
interactions that might be taking place during MMTV life cycle.

BACKGROUND: Declines in functional dependence among older adults were observed 
before the 1990s, but there is uncertainty about subsequent trends. Our study 
aimed to verify the temporal trends in disability during 1991-2010 in an older 
Swedish population and to estimate the associated changes in survival.
METHODS: Functional status in octogenarians and nonagenarians was assessed at 
seven occasions with intervals of 2-3 years. Sample size varied at each 
assessment with an average of 646 (range 212-1096). Disability was defined as 
difficulty in one or more of personal activities of daily living. We compared 
prevalence and incidence, as well as mortality, and survival associated with 
disability over the 20-year period.
RESULTS: Sex-standardized prevalence of disability remained steady over time 
with a tendency toward a gradual decline, and a statistically significant 
decrease was present among nonagenarians. Sex-standardized cumulative incidence 
also remained steady. The proportion of people with prevalent disability who 
died <3 years remained stable, as did the survival time of people with incident 
disability. In contrast, among nondisabled persons, 3-year mortality decreased 
significantly, and for octogenarians median survival time was 1.3 years longer 
at the more recent assessment than a decade earlier.
CONCLUSIONS: Both prevalence and incidence of disability remained stable over 
the last two decades in this urban Swedish population, with a trend toward a 
slow decline. Mortality remained steady among disabled persons but decreased 
among persons without disability, suggesting that increased life expectancy 
during the last two decades may be essentially driven by longer lives of 
functionally independent people.
