surgery in octogenarian and older patients were compared with younger patients.
RESULTS: Among octogenarian and older patients, relative to open surgery 
(n = 53), MIS (n = 27) was associated with less operative blood loss, a shorter 
postoperative hospital stay and similar rates of surgical complications and 
mortality. For MIS (n = 115), octogenarian and older patients exhibited similar 
postoperative outcomes to those of younger patients. For open surgery (n = 244), 
relative to younger patients, octogenarian and older patients experienced longer 
postoperative hospital stays, a higher rate of wound infection and a higher 
incidence of pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: MIS for gastric cancer is beneficial and can be performed safely in 
octogenarian and older patients.

BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa the prognosis of children with type 1 diabetes 
is poor. Many are not diagnosed and those diagnosed have a dramatically reduced 
life expectancy (less than one year). The purpose of this study was to identify 
the predictors of glucose control in children and adolescents with type 1 
diabetes.
METHODS: This hospital based cross-sectional study involved 76 
children/adolescents (35 boys and 41 girls, mean age of 15.1 ± 3.1 years) with 
type 1 diabetes included in the "Changing Diabetes in Children" (CDiC) program 
and attending the clinics for children living with type 1 diabetes in the North 
West Region of Cameroon. Data on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was obtained 
from hospital records of participants. Information on socio-demographic 
characteristics and diabetes related practices were obtained from participants 
using a structured questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using 
logistic regression models to assess the association between determinants and 
good glyceamic control.
RESULTS: The study population had a mean HbA1c of 10.3 ± 2.9%. Bivariate 
analysis indicated that having a mother as the primary caregiver (OR 0.07, 95% 
CI 0.02-0.2), being on 2 daily insulin injections (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5) and 
good blood glucose monitoring (BGM) adherence (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.04-0.3) were 
significantly (p < 0.001) associated with better HbA1c. Minimal/moderate 
caregiver involvement in BGM (OR 7.7, 95% CI 2.7-22.0) and insulin injection (OR 
14.9, 95% CI 4.8-46.5) were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with poor 
outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that having a mother as the primary 
caregiver (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.002-0.189) was an independent predictor of good 
glucose control.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the mother's involvement in the diabetes 
management of their children and minimal/moderate caregiver involvement in the 
task of insulin injection are the most important determinants for good and poor 
glucose control respectively. It is currently unclear whether the direct 
involvement of the mother is causal or whether "mother as a primary caregiver" 
is just an indicator for a setting in which good diabetes treatment is possible.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Dramatic increases in the average life expectancy have led 
to increases in the variety of degenerative changes and deformities observed in 
the aging spine. The elderly population can present challenges for spine 
surgeons, not only because of increased comorbidities, but also because of the 
quality of their bones. Pedicle screws are the implants used most commonly in 
spinal surgery for fixation, but their efficacy depends directly on bone 
quality. Although polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-augmented screws represent an 
alternative for patients with osteoporotic vertebrae, their use has raised some 
concerns because of the possible association between cement leakages (CLs) and 
other morbidities.
PURPOSE: To analyze potential complications related to the use of 
cement-augmented screws for spinal fusion and to investigate the effectiveness 
of using these screws in the treatment of patients with low bone quality.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective single-center study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: This study included 313 consecutive patients who underwent 
spinal fusion using a total of 1,780 cement-augmented screws.
METHODS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: We analyzed potential complications related to the 
use of cement-augmented screws, including CL, vascular injury, infection, screw 
extraction problems, revision surgery, and instrument failure. There are no 
financial conflicts of interest to report.
RESULTS: A total of 1,043 vertebrae were instrumented. Cement leakage was 
observed in 650 vertebrae (62.3%). There were no major clinical complications 
related to CL, but two patients (0.6%) had radicular pain related to CL at the 
S1 foramina. Of the 13 patients (4.1%) who developed deep infections requiring 
surgical debridement, two with chronic infections had possible spondylitis that 
required instrument removal. All patients responded well to antibiotic therapy. 
Revision surgery was performed in 56 patients (17.9%), most of whom had long 
construction. A total of 180 screws were removed as a result of revision. There 
were no problems with screw extraction.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
cement-augmented screws for the treatment of patients with low bone mineral 
density.

OBJECTIVE: Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are effective in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), but disadvantages include adverse events (AEs) and high costs. 
This can be improved by disease activity-guided dose reduction (DR). We aimed to 
assess long-term outcomes of TNFi DR in RA by using 3-year data from the DRESS 
study (Dose REduction Strategy of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors study).
METHODS: In the intervention phase (month 0-18) of the DRESS study (Dutch trial 
register, NTR 3216), patients were randomised to DR or usual care (UC). In the 
extension phase (month 18-36), treatment strategies in both groups converged to 
continuation of protocolised tight control and allowed dose optimisation. 
Intention-to-treat analyses were done on flare, disease activity (28 joint 
count-based disease activity score with C reactive protein (DAS28-CRP)), 
functioning (health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI)), quality 
of life (Euroqol 5 dimensions 5 levels questionnaire (EQ5D-5L)), medication use, 
radiographic progression (Sharp van der Heijde score (SvdH)) and AE.
RESULTS: 172/180 patients included in the DRESS study were included in the 
extension phase. Cumulative incidences of major flare were 10% and 12% (-2%, 
95% CI -8 to 15) in DR and UC groups in the extension phase, and 17% and 14% 
(3%, 95% CI -9 to 13) from 0 to 36 months. Cumulative incidences of short-lived 
flares were 43% (33 to 52%)%) and 35% (23 to 49%)%) in DR and UC groups in the 
extension phase, and 83% (75 to 90%)%) and 44% (31 to 58%)%) from 0 to 36 
months. Mean DAS28-CRP, HAQ-DI, EQ5D-5L and SvdH remained stable and not 
significantly different between groups. TNFi use remained low in the DR group 
and decreased in the UC group. Cumulative incidences of AE were not 
significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Safety and efficacy of disease activity guided TNFi DR in RA are 
maintained up to 3 years, with a large reduction in TNFi use, but no other 
benefits. Implementation of DR would vastly improve the cost-effective use of 
TNFi.

Universal health coverage and the health Sustainable Development Goal: 
achievements and challenges for Sri Lanka.

With state-funded health care that is free at the point of delivery, a sound 
primary health-care policy and widespread health-care services, Sri Lanka seems 
a good example of universal health coverage. Yet, health transition and 
disparities in provision and financing threaten this situation. Sri Lanka did 
well on the Millennium Development Goal health indicators, but the Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) for health has a wider purview, which is to "ensure 
healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages". The gender gap in 
life expectancy and the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy 
make achievement of the health SDG more challenging. Although women and children 
do well overall, the comparative health disadvantage for men in Sri Lanka is a 
cause for concern. From a financing perspective, high out-of-pocket expenditure 
and high utilization of the private sector, even by those in the lowest income 
quintile, are concerns, as is the emerging "third tier", where some individuals 
accessing state health care that is free at the point of delivery actually bear 
some of the costs of drugs, investigations and surgery. This cost sharing is 
resulting in catastrophic health expenditure for individuals, and delays in and 
non-compliance with treatment. These concerns about provision and financing must 
be addressed, as health transition will intensify the morbidity burden and loss 
of well-being, and could derail plans to achieve the health SDG.

Muscle satellite cells are essential for muscle regeneration. However, efficient 
regeneration does not occur without muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitor 
cells. We show here that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Bm-MSCs) 
also facilitate muscle regeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model 
mice. Bm-MSCs transplanted into peritoneal cavities of DMD model mice with 
severe muscle degeneration strongly suppressed dystrophic pathology and improved 
death-related symptoms, which resulted in dramatic lifespan extension. Isolated 
single myofibers from Bm-MSC-transplanted mice manifested considerably less 
myofiber splitting compared with myofibers from non-transplanted mice, which 
indicated that transplantation significantly ameliorated abnormal regeneration. 
With regard to the number of satellite cells, several cells remained on 
myofibers from Bm-MSC-transplanted model mice, but satellite cells rarely 
occurred on myofibers from non-transplanted mice. Also, CXCL12 was crucial for 
muscle regeneration. CXCL12 facilitated muscle regeneration and paired box 
protein-7 (PAX7) expression after cardiotoxin-related muscle injury in vivo. The 
majority of primary muscle satellite cells sorted by integrin-α7 and CD34 
expressed CXCR4, a receptor specific for CXCL12. CXCL12 strongly suppressed 
p-STAT3 expression in these sorted cells in vitro. CXCL12 may therefore 
influence muscle regeneration through STAT3 signaling in satellite cells. 
Targeting these proteins in or on muscle satellite cells may improve many 
degenerative muscle diseases.

BACKGROUND: Hurler Syndrome is the most severe phenotype of 
mucopolysaccharidosis type I. With bone marrow transplant and enzyme replacement 
therapy, the life expectancy of a child with Hurler syndrome has been extended, 
predisposing them to multiple musculoskeletal issues most commonly involving the 
spine.
CASE DESCRIPTION: This is the case report of a 6-year-old male with Hurler 
syndrome who was diagnosed with Chiari I malformation and cervicothoracic 
syringomyelia on a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for his 
thoracolumbar kyphosis. This report details the successful management of a 
Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia with posterior fossa decompression in a 
child with Hurler syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Children born with MPS I can have complex spine issues that require 
surgical management. The most common orthopedic spinal condition for these 
patients, thoracolumbar kyphosis, requires evaluation with an MRI before 
performing surgery. This resulted in the diagnosis of a Chiari I malformation 
and syringomyelia in our patient with Hurler syndrome. This was successfully 
treated with decompression of the posterior fossa.

Odontogenic tumours are a group of heterogeneous diseases that range from 
hamartomatous or non-neoplastic tissue proliferations to benign neoplasms to 
malignant tumours with metastatic potential. They are rare, comprising about 
<2-3% of all oral and maxillofacial biopsy specimens. The aim of the present 
study was to determine the clinico-pathological presentation of this 
heterogeneous group of lesions and review of literature. The present study was 
conducted in the ENT department of a Government Medical College and Hospital, 
West Bengal, India, over the period of 5 years from January 2011 to December 
2015. It included a total of 15 patients who were clinico-radiologically 
diagnosed as odontogenic tumours, and were given appropriate treatment. Their 
diagnostic and management approaches are discussed. Among 15 odontogenic 
tumours, 13 were benign and two were malignant. Male to female ratio was 2:3. 
Mandible to maxilla ratio was 1.8:1. The patients were in between 4 and 56 years 
of age with highest incidence in 3rd decade of life. All patients are doing well 
till date with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Incisional biopsy is considered as 
gold standard for preoperative diagnosis but FNAC can offer clinicians a less 
invasive alternative. CT is the choice of investigation for study of lesion, 
analysis of its extension and surgical planning. The challenge to proper 
management lies in balancing between conservative and radical approach to reduce 
morbidity and recurrence both. Final diagnosis is made by post-operative 
histopathological examination.

The majority of people who experience mental health issues also have poor 
physical health resulting in decreased life expectancy. Fortunately, many 
physical health issues can be identified and rectified by monitoring various 
health indicators over a time period. The Physical Health Diary is a tool that 
people can use by themselves and/or with others to track, monitor and improve 
their physical health over time.

Erratum in
    J Neurol. 2017 Jul 10;:

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular 
junction disorder that is related to the loss of functional P/Q-type 
voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) on presynaptic nerve terminals. Up to 60% 
of cases occur as a paraneoplastic disorder (SCLC-LEMS), most commonly in 
association with small cell lung cancer. The remaining cases have an idiopathic 
non-tumor etiology but are associated with underlying autoimmune disease 
(NT-LEMS). Patients with LEMS invariably experience progressive proximal muscle 
weakness, often accompanied by general fatigue and autonomic symptoms. Some LEMS 
clinical symptoms overlap with those of other myasthenic syndromes, most 
commonly myasthenia gravis, which can contribute to misdiagnosis or delayed 
diagnosis. Prognosis is related to the presence of cancer or autoimmune disease 
and the severity/distribution of muscle weakness. Cause of death in patients 
with SCLC-LEMS is typically tumor progression, whereas NT-LEMS does not reduce 
life expectancy. LEMS diagnosis is supported by a threefold approach: clinical 
features, electromyography, and anti-VGCC antibody serology. LEMS is a 
clinically important early indicator of possible cancer; therefore, a LEMS 
diagnosis should immediately prompt rigorous oncological screening and 
surveillance. Symptomatic treatment of LEMS typically involves medications that 
improve neurotransmission (e.g., the potassium channel blocker amifampridine 
[3,4-diaminopyridine]), with addition of immunosuppressants/modulators (e.g., 
prednisone plus azathioprine) in individuals with persistent symptoms. Where a 
tumor is identified, oncological treatment should take priority. It should be 
remembered, however, that LEMS has a significant impact on a patient's quality 
of life and ability to perform daily activities, and therefore warrants timely 
diagnosis and appropriate treatment in and of itself.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep-vein 
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major healthcare concern that 
results in substantial morbidity and mortality with great economic burden for 
healthcare systems. Hence, the need for effective and efficient treatment of 
patients with VTE is important for both clinical and economic reasons. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban 
compared to standard of care (SoC) with enoxaparin followed by dose-adjusted 
vitamin-K antagonists for the treatment of DVT and PE in Greece.
METHODS: An existing Markov model was locally adapted from a third-party payer 
perspective to reflect the management and complications of DVT and PE in the 
course of 3-month cycles, up to death. The clinical inputs and utility values 
were extracted from published studies. Direct medical costs, obtained from local 
resources, were incorporated in the model and refer to year 2017. Both costs and 
outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was carried out to deal with 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that rivaroxaban in 3- and 6-month 
treatment duration for DVT and PE, respectively, as this is the common clinical 
practice in Greece, was associated with a 0.02 and 0.01 increment in QALYs 
compared to SoC, respectively. Rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced total 
cost in DVT (€85) but with an additional total cost in PE (€2) compared to SoC. 
Therefore, rivaroxaban was a dominant (less costly, more effective) and 
cost-effective (ICER: €177) alternative over SoC for the management of DVT and 
PE, respectively. PSA revealed that the probability of rivaroxaban being cost 
effective at a threshold of €34,000 per QALY gained was 99% and 81% for DVT and 
PE, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban may represent a cost-effective option relative to SoC 
for the management of DVT and PE in Greece.

BACKGROUND: Twelve-month extension of a previous spontaneous exploratory study 
investigating safety and efficacy of a new low-energy dynamic quadripolar 
radiofrequency (DQRF) device in: A) premenopausal women with symptoms of vaginal 
laxity, with special reference to dysuria, urinary incontinence and 
unsatisfactory sexual life (vaginal laxity arm of the study); B) postmenopausal 
women with vulvovaginal atrophy/genitourinary syndrome of menopause (VVA/GSM) 
and VVA/GSM-related symptoms (VVA/GSM arm of the study). DQRF treatment schedule 
in both study arms: 4 to 6 procedures of 15 to 20 min every 14 days (vaginal 
laxity, range 12-17 days; VVA/GSM, range 13-16). Operative temperatures in 
vaginal target tissues during procedure: vaginal laxity, 42 °C (range 40-43 °C); 
VVA/GSM, 40 °C (range 40-42 °C).
METHODS: In the vaginal laxity arm of the study, 25 women with subjective 
sensation of vaginal introital laxity (very to slightly loose). Assessment of 
urinary incontinence, satisfaction with sexual relationship and contribution of 
pelvic organ prolapse: Vaginal Laxity Questionnaire (VLQ, Italian certified 
translation) and short form of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence 
Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12, Italian certified translation). Further 
evaluation of sexual gratification: Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ). In 
the VVA/GSM arm of the study, 32 women with objective evidence of VVA and 
vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia as most bothersome symptoms. Assessment of 
VVA/GSM symptoms and overall satisfaction with sexual life: specifically 
designed 10-cm visual analogue scales.
RESULTS: All 4 to 6 planned DQRF sessions were well tolerated in both the 
vaginal laxity and VVA/GSM arms of the study, with no troubling pain, thermal 
injury or other immediate adverse effects during all the procedures. All 
screened women completed the planned DQRF treatment sessions in both arms of the 
extension study. There was no participant attrition with only a few occasionally 
missing visits over the 12-month follow-up period. Improvements were rapid in 
self-perception of introital looseness and related symptoms like dysuria/urinary 
incontinence and unrewarding sexual relationship (vaginal laxity patients) and 
atrophy-related symptoms including painful and unsatisfactory sexual activity 
(VVA/GSM patients). Participating women consistently reported wide-spectrum 
strong clinical improvements by the end of the planned DQRF sessions. Clinical 
improvements remained steady for the whole follow-up period in postmenopausal 
women; a statistically non-significant tendency to slight deterioration in VLQ, 
PISQ-12 and SSQ mean scores was detected after 6 to 9 months of follow-up in the 
vaginal laxity arm of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Safety was excellent during all DQRF procedures and over the 12 
months following the end of the treatment sessions. VLQ, PISQ-12 and SSQ scores 
(women with vaginal laxity), VAS self-evaluation of VVA/GSM symptoms and overall 
satisfaction with sexual life (women with VVA/GSM symptoms) improved rapidly, 
reaching almost normal levels by the last DQRF session and suggesting rapid, but 
also persistent, vaginal rejuvenation in both indications. A late tendency to 
some slight deterioration in women treated for vaginal laxity suggests such 
women might benefit from new DQRF treatments 6 to 9 months after the previous 
cycle.

Use of gases (air, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) has been practiced in the 
manufacture of dairy products (i.e., ice cream, whipped cream and butter) to 
improve their texture, mouthfeel and shelf-life extension. Many attempts have 
also been made to incorporate other gases such as hydrogen, nitrous oxide, 
argon, xenon, and helium into the dairy systems for various product 
functionalities such as whipping, foaming, texture, aroma enhancement, and 
therapeutic properties. The gases can be dissolved in aqueous and fat phases or 
remain in the form of bubbles stabilized by protein or fat particles. The gas 
addition or infusion processes are typically simple and have been used 
commercially. This review focuses on the use of various gases in relation to 
their individually physical properties along with their specific roles in 
manufacturing and controlling quality of dairy products. It also recaps on how 
gases are included in the dairy systems. The information is important in 
understanding of addition of specific gas(es) into food systems, particularly 
dairy products, that potentially provide intervention opportunities for 
modifying and/or creating innovative food structures and functionalities.

Although the incidence of prostate cancer is rising due to PSA screening and 
increased life expectancy, the metastatic potential of low-grade, organ-confined 
disease remains low. An increasing number of studies suggest that radical 
treatment in such cases confers little or no survival benefit at a significant 
cost to morbidity. Active surveillance is a promising management approach of 
such low-risk cancers: eligible patients are selected based on clinical and 
pathological findings at diagnosis and are regularly monitored with digital 
rectal examinations, PSA testing and biopsies. Treatment, however, is deferred 
until and unless there is evidence of disease progression. This is a key 
difference from watchful waiting, where treatment is avoided until and unless 
there are symptoms. The purpose of this work is to review the rationale and 
evidence behind active surveillance and to offer an overview of current active 
surveillance strategies and outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: As life expectancy increases, the number of women reporting adverse 
genito-urinary symptoms (genitourinary syndrome of menopause; GSM) from 
menopause, including vaginal dryness and sexual pain, also will increase. 
Current objective measurements of vaginal atrophy such as maturation index 
require vaginal swabs and are invasive; at present, no minimally invasive 
measurements exist. The purpose of this study was to assess whether total 
vaginal wall thickness (TVT) and total vaginal mucosa thickness (TMT) as 
measured by transabdominal ultrasound could qualify as additional objective 
markers of vaginal wall thinning which could be related to menopausal status.
DESIGN: Women presenting for pelvic ultrasound had a transabdominal ultrasound 
scan performed to measure TVT and TMT at the level of the bladder trigone. In 
addition, a transvaginal endometrial lining thickness was measured.
RESULTS: The ultrasound measurement data from 76 participants showed that there 
was a significant difference in the mean value for TVT and endometrial lining 
between pre- and post-menopausal women. The same difference in mean was not 
observed for TMT.
CONCLUSION: TVT may be a reliable measure of vaginal thinning, which worsens 
with estrogen decline. These preliminary data also suggest that TMT does not 
have the same correlation as the TVT measurement. A larger sample is needed to 
further assess the usefulness and sensitivity of these measures and whether 
there is clinical and/or research usefulness in obtaining vaginal wall 
measurements by transabdominal ultrasound.

Despite their relatively low prevalence, vascular diseases of the liver 
represent a significant health problem in the field of liver disease. A common 
characteristic shared by many such diseases is their propensity to cause portal 
hypertension together with increased morbidity and mortality. These diseases are 
often diagnosed in young patients and their delayed diagnosis and/or 
inappropriate treatment can greatly reduce life expectancy. This article reviews 
the current body of evidence concerning Budd-Chiari syndrome, non-cirrhotic 
portal vein thrombosis, idiopathic portal hypertension, sinusoidal obstruction 
syndrome, hepatic vascular malformations in hereditary haemorrhagic 
telangiectasia, cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis and other rarer vascular 
diseases including arterioportal fistulas. It also includes a section on the 
diagnostic imaging of vascular diseases of the liver and their treatment from a 
haematological standpoint (study of thrombotic diathesis and anticoagulation 
therapy). All recommendations are based on published studies extracted from 
PubMed. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated in 
accordance with the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment 
Development and Evaluation). In the absence of sufficient evidence, 
recommendations were based on the opinion of the committee that produced the 
guide.

Ubiquitin (Ub) is an important signaling protein. Recent studies have shown that 
Ub can be enzymatically phosphorylated at S65, and that the resulting pUb 
exhibits two conformational states-a relaxed state and a retracted state. 
However, crystallization efforts have yielded only the structure for the relaxed 
state, which was found similar to that of unmodified Ub. Here we present the 
solution structures of pUb in both states obtained through refinement against 
state-specific NMR restraints. We show that the retracted state differs from the 
relaxed state by the retraction of the last β-strand and by the extension of the 
second α-helix. Further, we show that at 7.2, the pKa value for the phosphoryl 
group in the relaxed state is higher by 1.4 units than that in the retracted 
state. Consequently, pUb exists in equilibrium between protonated and 
deprotonated forms and between retracted and relaxed states, with 
protonated/relaxed species enriched at slightly acidic pH and 
deprotonated/retracted species enriched at slightly basic pH. The heterogeneity 
of pUb explains the inability of phosphomimetic mutants to fully mimic pUb. The 
pH-sensitive conformational switch is likely preserved for polyubiquitin, as 
single-molecule FRET data indicate that pH change leads to quaternary 
rearrangement of a phosphorylated K63-linked diubiquitin. Because cellular pH 
varies among compartments and changes upon pathophysiological insults, our 
finding suggests that pH and Ub phosphorylation confer additional target 
specificities and enable an additional layer of modulation for Ub signals.

Measuring universal health coverage: a three-dimensional composite approach from 
Bhutan.

BACKGROUND: In the early 1960s, the Kingdom of Bhutan began to develop its 
modern health-care system and by the 1990s had developed an extensive network of 
health-care facilities. These developments, in tandem with wider social and 
economic progress encapsulated in the Gross National Happiness concept, have 
resulted in major gains in child survival and life expectancy in the past 50 
years. In order to sustain these gains, the country has identified a 
constitutional and health-policy mandate for universal access to health.
METHODS: Based on analysis of the literature, and qualitative and quantitative 
health data, this case study aims to provide an assessment of universal health 
coverage in Bhutan, and to identify the major challenges to measuring, 
monitoring and sustaining universal coverage.
RESULTS: The study reveals that the wide network of primary and secondary care, 
reinforced by constitutional and policy mandates, ensures high population 
coverage, as well as wide availability and accessibility of care, with 
significant levels of financial protection. This achievement has been 
attributable to sustained state investment in the sector over past decades. 
Despite this achievement, recent surveys have demonstrated gaps in utilization 
of health services and confirmed associations between socioeconomic variables 
and health access and outcomes, which raise important questions relating to both 
supply- and demand-side barriers in accessing health care.
CONCLUSION: In order to sustain and improve the quality of universal health 
coverage, improved measurements of service availability at subnational levels 
and of the determinants of pockets of low service utilization are required. More 
rigorous monitoring of financial protection is also needed, particularly in 
relation to rates of public investment and the impact of out-of-pocket costs 
while accessing care. These approaches should assist improvements in quality and 
equity in universal health coverage, in the context of ongoing epidemiological, 
demographic and social transition.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of suboptimal treatment, 
defined in terms of lower population coverage (percentage of total patient 
population receiving optimal treatment) and delay to treatment on the 
cost-effectiveness of pharmacological therapies approved for the treatment of 
different severities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the UK.
METHODS: A 5-year Markov model was used to simulate transition to full-time 
care, as delay and coverage were varied for AD patients with mild-to-moderate 
and moderate-to-severe dementia. The time-varying predictive equations, resource 
use, utilities, treatment effects and mortality were derived using published 
sources.
RESULTS: For the cohort with moderate-to-severe dementia, cost-effectiveness was 
optimised when delay was minimised and coverage maximised. For mild-to-moderate 
dementia, results were similar but varied widely depending on the inputted cost 
of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: The average cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for AD 
is sensitive to delays to treatment and population coverage. The results of this 
study can inform future healthcare policy in order to maximise 
cost-effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for AD. Copyright © 2017 John

Protein quality control mechanisms, required for normal cellular functioning, 
encompass multiple functions related to protein production and maintenance. 
However, the existence of communication between proteostasis and metabolic 
networks and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that 
enhanced chaperone activity and consequent improved proteostasis are sensed by 
TORC1 via the activity of Hsp82. Chaperone enrichment decreases the level of 
Hsp82, which deactivates TORC1 and leads to activation of Snf1/AMPK, regardless 
of glucose availability. This mechanism culminates in the extension of yeast 
replicative lifespan (RLS) that is fully reliant on both TORC1 deactivation and 
Snf1/AMPK activation. Specifically, we identify oxygen consumption increase as 
the downstream effect of Snf1 activation responsible for the entire RLS 
extension. Our results set a novel paradigm for the role of proteostasis in 
aging: modulation of the misfolded protein level can affect cellular metabolic 
features as well as mitochondrial activity and consequently modify lifespan. The 
described mechanism is expected to open new avenues for research of aging and 
age-related diseases.

For Debate: Should Bariatric Surgery be Performed in Children and Adolescents 
with Hypothalamic Obesity?

Hypothalamic dysfunction leading to severe obesity is a serious long-term 
consequence of paediatric craniopharyngioma. It compromises quality of life, 
leads to long-term metabolic hazards, and may shorten life expectancy. 
Therefore, a proactive approach is required. Conventional treatment of 
hypothalamic obesity is difficult and hardly successful. Experience with 
bariatric surgery is limited, especially in younger patients. Two retrospective 
studies recently reported on classic bariatric surgery in a small series of 
individuals after craniopharyngioma. Of these, one included nine paediatric 
patients who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), sleeve 
gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or biliopancreatic diversion 
(BPD). The immediate effects were promising: The mean weight loss was 20.9 
kilograms at 6 months and 15.1 kilograms at 12 months. A duodenal-jejunal bypass 
sleeve (DBJS; EndoBarrier) is a mini-invasive, endoscopically placed and fully 
reversible bariatric procedure. We reported a boy diagnosed with 
craniopharyngioma at 10 years old who underwent surgery and radiotherapy. His 
body weight increased to 139 kilograms and body mass index (BMI) to 46.1 kg/m2 
(+4.0 SD) within the subsequent 4.5 years. Fifteen months after DJBS placement, 
he lost 32.8 kilograms, and his BMI dropped to 32.7 kg/m2 (+2.9 SD). Thus, DJBS
