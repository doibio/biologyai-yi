potential mediation pathways.
RESULTS: SLE, HRWL and vitality mediated the association between CHCs and older 
workers' early retirement preferences. The dominant mediator differed depending 
on the CHC. Severe HRWL predominantly guided the retirement preferences of older 
workers with arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Lower vitality mainly 
mediated retirement preferences of older workers with sleep and psychological 
disorders. Lower SLE was a significant mediation pathway for older workers with 
cardiovascular diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: HRWL and vitality play a major role in determining retirement 
preferences of older workers experiencing CHCs. Since both mediators are 
modifiable, targeted interventions may not only extend older workers' working 
lives, but also improve the quality of their working lives.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of albumin-based fluid support in patients 
with septic shock is currently unknown.
METHODS: In a simulation study, we compared standard medical practice and 
systematic 20% albumin infusion. The study population consisted of patients with 
septic shock admitted to one of the 28 ICUs belonging to the Cub-Réa regional 
database between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. Cost estimates were based 
on French diagnosis-related groups and fixed daily prices. Estimation of 
mortality reduction relied on ALBIOS trial data documenting a Risk Ratio of 0.87 
in a non-preplanned subgroup of patients with septic shock. Life expectancy was 
estimated with follow up data of 184 patients with septic shock admitted in the 
year 2000 in the same ICUs. Several sensitivity analyses were performed 
including a one-way Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis (DSA) and a Probabilistic 
multivariate Sensitivity Analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: About 6406 patients were included. In the base-case scenario, the mean 
live years gained with albumin was 0.49. The mean extra cost of using albumin 
was €480 per year. The cost per year gained was €974. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the results. The probability of albumin being 
cost-effective was 95% and 97% for a threshold fixed at €20 000 and €30 000 per 
life-year saved, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Based on the risk reduction observed in the septic shock subgroup 
analysis of the ALBIOS dataset, the application of the ALBIOS trial results to 
Cub-Réa data may suggest that albumin infusion is likely cost-effective in 
septic shock.

Experimentally increased brood size accelerates actuarial senescence and 
increases subsequent reproductive effort in a wild bird population.

The assumption that reproductive effort decreases somatic state, accelerating 
ageing, is central to our understanding of life-history variation. Maximal 
reproductive effort early in life is predicted to be maladaptive by accelerating 
ageing disproportionally, decreasing fitness. Optimality theory predicts that 
reproductive effort is restrained early in life to balance the fitness 
contribution of reproduction against the survival cost induced by the 
reproductive effort. When adaptive, the level of reproductive restraint is 
predicted to be inversely linked to the remaining life expectancy, potentially 
resulting in a terminal effort in the last period of reproduction. Experimental 
tests of the reproductive restraint hypothesis require manipulation of somatic 
state and subsequent investigation of reproductive effort and residual life 
span. To our knowledge the available evidence remains inconclusive, and hence 
reproductive restraint remains to be demonstrated. We modulated somatic state 
through a lifelong brood size manipulation in wild jackdaws and measured its 
consequences for age-dependent mortality and reproductive success. The 
assumption that lifelong increased brood size reduced somatic state was 
supported: Birds rearing enlarged broods showed subsequent increased rate of 
actuarial senescence, resulting in reduced residual life span. The treatment 
induced a reproductive response in later seasons: Egg volume and nestling 
survival were higher in subsequent seasons in the increased versus reduced 
broods' treatment group. We detected these increases in egg volume and nestling 
survival despite the expectation that in the absence of a change in reproductive 
effort, the reduced somatic state indicated by the increased mortality rate 
would result in lower reproductive output. This leads us to conclude that the 
higher reproductive success we observed was the result of higher reproductive 
effort. Our findings show that reproductive effort negatively covaries with 
remaining life expectancy, supporting optimality theory and confirming 
reproductive restraint as a key factor underpinning life-history variation.

Cryonics for all?

Thau T(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Philosophy, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.

In fascinating recent work, some philosophers have argued that it would be 
morally permissible and prudentially rational to sign up for cryonics-if you can 
afford the price tag of the procedure. In this paper I ask: why not share the 
elixir of extended life with everyone? Should governments financially support, 
positively encourage, or even require people to undergo cryonics? From a general 
principle of beneficence, I construct a formal argument for cryonics promotion 
policies. I consider the objection that a subset of these policies would violate 
autonomy, but I argue that-to the contrary-considerations of autonomy weigh in 
their favour. I then consider objections based on cost and population, but argue 
that neither is fatal. Finally, I raise the objection that I believe poses the 
most serious challenge: that those who revive the cryonically preserved might 
inflict suffering upon them.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, as an adjunct to insulin in adults with type 
1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) inadequately controlled by insulin alone in the UK 
setting.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare dapagliflozin (5 mg or 
10 mg) added to insulin versus insulin monotherapy (standard of care) over a 
lifetime horizon. Treatment efficacy and safety data were obtained from 52-week 
results of the DEPICT-1 and DEPICT-2 trials and a network meta-analysis of SGLT2 
inhibitors in T1DM. Direct healthcare costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were estimated from a UK payer perspective and discounted at 
3.5% annually, using the Cardiff T1DM Model. Sensitivity analyses assessed 
uncertainty in estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin 5 mg was associated with gains of 0.23 life-years and 
0.42 QALYs, at an additional cost of £4240 per person; corresponding to an ICER 
of £10 143 versus standard of care. For dapagliflozin 10 mg, incremental 
life-years, QALYs and costs were 0.24, 0.49 and £2964, respectively; 
corresponding to an ICER of £6103 versus standard of care. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, ICER estimates fell below £20 000/QALY in 78% to 90% of 
simulations. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to changes in baseline 
patient characteristics and treatment effects on glycated haemoglobin; however, 
ICERs remained below £20 000.
CONCLUSIONS: At cost-effectiveness thresholds conventionally applied in the UK, 
dapagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin appears to be a cost-effective treatment 
option for people with T1DM inadequately controlled by insulin alone.

The Alternaria section alternaria (Alternaria alternata species group) 
represents a diverse group of saprotroph, human allergens, and plant pathogens. 
Alternaria taxonomy has benefited from recent phylogenetic revision but the 
basis of differentiation between major phylogenetic clades within the group is 
not yet understood. Furthermore, genomic resources have been limited for the 
study of host-specific pathotypes. We report near complete genomes of the apple 
and Asian pear pathotypes as well as draft assemblies for a further 10 isolates 
representing Alternaria tenuissima and Alternaria arborescens lineages. These 
assemblies provide the first insights into differentiation of these taxa as well 
as allowing the description of effector and non-effector profiles of apple and 
pear conditionally dispensable chromosomes (CDCs). We define the phylogenetic 
relationship between the isolates sequenced in this study and a further 23 
Alternaria spp. based on available genomes. We determine which of these genomes 
represent MAT1-1-1 or MAT1-2-1 idiomorphs and designate host-specific 
pathotypes. We show for the first time that the apple pathotype is polyphyletic, 
present in both the A. arborescens and A. tenuissima lineages. Furthermore, we 
profile a wider set of 89 isolates for both mating type idiomorphs and toxin 
gene markers. Mating-type distribution indicated that gene flow has occurred 
since the formation of A. tenuissima and A. arborescens lineages. We also 
developed primers designed to AMT14, a gene from the apple pathotype toxin gene 
cluster with homologs in all tested pathotypes. These primers allow 
identification and differentiation of apple, pear, and strawberry pathotypes, 
providing new tools for pathogen diagnostics.

The increasing life expectancy of humans has led to a growing numbers of 
patients with chronic diseases and end-stage organ failure. Transplantation is 
an effective approach for the treatment of end-stage organ failure; however, the 
imbalance between organ supply and the demand for human organs is a bottleneck 
for clinical transplantation. Therefore, xenotransplantation might be a 
promising alternative approach to bridge the gap between the supply and demand 
of organs, tissues, and cells; however, immunological barriers are limiting 
factors in clinical xenotransplantation. Thanks to advances in gene-editing 
tools and immunosuppressive therapy as well as the prolonged xenograft survival 
time in pig-to-non-human primate models, clinical xenotransplantation has become 
more viable. In this review, we focus on the evolution and current status of 
xenotransplantation research, including our current understanding of the 
immunological mechanisms involved in xenograft rejection, genetically modified 
pigs used for xenotransplantation, and progress that has been made in developing 
pig-to-pig-to-non-human primate models. Three main types of rejection can occur 
after xenotransplantation, which we discuss in detail: (1) hyperacute xenograft 
rejection, (2) acute humoral xenograft rejection, and (3) acute cellular 
rejection. Furthermore, in studies on immunological rejection, genetically 
modified pigs have been generated to bridge cross-species molecular 
incompatibilities; in the last decade, most advances made in the field of 
xenotransplantation have resulted from the production of genetically engineered 
pigs; accordingly, we summarize the genetically modified pigs that are currently 
available for xenotransplantation. Next, we summarize the longest survival time 
of solid organs in preclinical models in recent years, including heart, liver, 
kidney, and lung xenotransplantation. Overall, we conclude that recent 
achievements and the accumulation of experience in xenotransplantation mean that 
the first-in-human clinical trial could be possible in the near future. 
Furthermore, we hope that xenotransplantation and various approaches will be 
able to collectively solve the problem of human organ shortage.

Background: Research has shown that engaging in regular physical activity 
supports physiologic, metabolic, and immunologic processes, as well as quality 
of life. However, few youth in the United States meet the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services recommendation of 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity every day. School-based programs can be an effective avenue 
for engaging youth in physical activity, particularly when the design of the 
health education is based on theory, research, and practice. The purpose of this 
study was to design, implement, and evaluate a theory-driven physical activity 
curriculum for the Shaping Healthy Choices Program (SHCP) using a systematic 
approach. Methods: The experiential, inquiry-based physical activity curriculum, 
Healthy Choices in Motion (HCIM), was developed with an optional technology 
enhancement using Backward Design. A questionnaire to assess the curriculum's 
effect on physical activity knowledge was developed and assessed for content 
validity, internal consistency (α = 0.84), and test-retest reliability (r = 
0.73). The curriculum was piloted in two phases among upper elementary-aged 
youth: to ensure the learning goals were met (Pilot I) and to determine the 
curriculum's impact on physical activity knowledge, behavior, and self-efficacy 
(Pilot II). Pilot II was implemented among eight 4th and 5th-grade classrooms 
participating in the UC CalFresh Nutrition Education Program: (1) Comparison (no 
intervention) (n = 25); (2) SHCP only (n = 22); (3) SHCP + HCIM (n = 42); (4) 
SHCP + HCIM with technology enhancement (n = 47). Analyses included unadjusted 
ANOVA and Bonferroni for multiple comparisons and paired t-test (p < 0.05). 
Results: Through the use of a methodical design approach, a comprehensive 
physical activity curriculum, called HCIM, was developed. Youth participating in 
HCIM improved physical activity knowledge compared to youth receiving no 
intervention (+2.8 points, p = 0.009) and youth only in the SHCP (+3.0 points, p 
= 0.007). Youth participating in HCIM with technology enhancement demonstrated 
improvements compared to youth only in the SHCP (+2.3 points, p = 0.05). 
Conclusion: Improvements in physical activity knowledge in youth participating 
in HCIM may contribute to improvements in physical activity and should be 
further explored in conjunction with behavioral measurements.

Aging is commonly defined as the time-dependent functional decline of organs and 
tissues. Average life expectancy has increased considerably over the past 
century and is estimated to increase even further, consequently also the 
interest in understanding the aging processes. Although aging is not a disease, 
it is the major risk factor for the development of many chronic diseases. 
Pathologies, such as Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) and Primary Sclerosing 
Cholangitis (PSC) are cholestatic liver diseases characterized by chronic 
inflammation, biliary damage and ultimately liver fibrosis, targeting 
specifically cholangiocytes. To date, the influence of aging in these biliary 
diseases is not fully understood. Currently, liver transplantation is the only 
solution because of lacking in efficiently therapies. Although liver cells have 
a high regenerative capacity, they undergo extensive molecular changes in 
response to aging. Following time-dependent damage induced by aging, the cells 
initially activate protective compensatory processes that, if hyperstimulated, 
can lead to the decline of regenerative ability and the development of 
pathologies. Recent studies have introduced novel therapeutic tools for 
cholangiopathies that have showed to have promising potential as novel therapies 
for PSC and PBC and for the development of new drugs. The recent advancements in 
understanding of molecular aging have undoubtedly the potential to unveil new 
pathways for selective drug treatments, but further studies are needed to deepen 
their knowledge.

Adeno-Associated Viral Vector Mediated Expression of Broadly- Neutralizing 
Antibodies Against HIV-Hitting a Fast-Moving Target.

The vast genetic variability of HIV has impeded efforts towards a cure for HIV. 
Lifelong administration of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is highly 
effective against HIV and has markedly increased the life expectancy of HIV 
infected individuals. However, the long-term usage of cART is associated with 
co-morbidities and the emergence of multidrug-resistant escape mutants 
necessitating the development of alternative approaches to combat HIV/AIDS. In 
the past decade, the development of single-cell antibody cloning methods has 
facilitated the characterization of a diverse array of highly potent 
neutralizing antibodies against a broad range of HIV strains. Although the 
passive transfer of these broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in both animal 
models and humans has been shown to elicit significant antiviral effects, long 
term virologic suppression requires repeated administration of these antibodies. 
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated antibody gene transfer provides a 
long-term expression of these antibodies from a single administration of the 
recombinant vector. Therefore, this vectored approach holds promises in the 
treatment and prevention of a chronic disease like HIV infection. Here, we 
provide an overview of HIV genetic diversity, AAV vectorology, and anti-HIV 
bnAbs and summarize the promises and challenges of the application of AAV in the 
delivery of bnAbs for HIV prevention and therapy.

BACKGROUND: Dementia care management (DCM) aims to provide optimal treatment for 
people with dementia (PwD). Treatment and care needs are dependent on patients' 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and thus, economic outcomes could 
depend on such characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: To detect important subgroups that benefit most from DCM and for 
which a significant effect on cost, QALY, and the individual cost-effectiveness 
could be achieved.
METHODS: The analysis was based on 444 participants of the DelpHi-trial. For 
each subgroup, the probability of DCM being cost-effective was calculated and 
visualized using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The impact of DCM on 
individual costs and QALYs was assessed by using multivariate regression models 
with interaction terms.
RESULTS: The probability of DCM being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of 
40,000€ /QALY was higher in females (96% versus 16% for males), in those living 
alone (96% versus 26% for those living not alone), in those being moderately to 
severely cognitively (100% versus 3% for patients without cognitive impairment) 
and functionally impaired (97% versus 16% for patients without functional 
impairment), and in PwD having a high comorbidity (96% versus 26% for patients 
with a low comorbidity). Multivariate analyses revealed that females 
(b = -10,873; SE = 4,775, p = 0.023) who received the intervention had 
significantly lower healthcare cost. DCM significantly improved QALY for PwD 
with mild and moderate cognitive (b = +0.232, SE = 0.105) and functional 
deficits (b = +0.200, SE = 0.095).
CONCLUSION: Patients characteristics significantly affect the 
cost-effectiveness. Females, patients living alone, patients with a high 
comorbidity, and those being moderately cognitively and functionally impaired 
benefit most from DCM. For those subgroups, healthcare payers could gain the 
highest cost savings and the highest effects on QALYs when DCM will be 
implemented.

Lung cancer screening programs with computed tomography of the chest reduce 
mortality by more than 20%. Yet, they have not been implemented widely because 
of logistic and cost implications. Here, we sought to: (1) use real-life data to 
compare the outcomes and cost of lung cancer patients with treated medically or 
surgically in our region and (2) from this data, estimate the cost-benefit ratio 
of a lung cancer screening program (CRIBAR) soon to be deployed in our region 
(Catalunya, Spain). We accessed the Catalan Health Surveillance System (CHSS) 
and analysed data of all patients with a first diagnosis of lung cancer between 
1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. Analysis was carried forward until 
30 months (t = 30) after lung cancer diagnosis. Main results showed that: (1) 
surgically treated lung cancer patients have better survival and return earlier 
to regular home activities, use less healthcare related resources and cost less 
tax-payer money and (2) depending on incidence of lung cancer identified and 
treated in the program (1-2%), the return on investment for CRIBAR is expected 
to break even at 3-6 years, respectively, after its launch. Surgical treatment 
of lung cancer is cheaper and offers better outcomes. CRIBAR is estimated to be 
cost-effective soon after launch.

OBJECTIVE: The need to align investments in health research and development 
(R&D) with public health needs is one of the most important public health 
challenges in Japan. We examined the alignment of disease-specific publicly 
competitive R&D funding to the disease burden in the country.
METHODS: We analyzed publicly available data on competitive public funding for 
health in 2015 and 2016 and compared it to disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) 
in 2016, which were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. 
Their alignment was assessed as a percentage distribution among 22 GBD disease 
groups. Funding was allocated to the 22 disease groups based on natural language 
processing, using textual information such as project title and abstract for 
each research project, while considering for the frequency of information.
RESULTS: Total publicly competitive funding in health R&D in 2015 and 2016 
reached 344.1 billion JPY (about 3.0 billion USD) for 32,204 awarded projects. 
About 49.5% of the funding was classifiable for disease-specific projects. Five 
GDB disease groups were significantly and relatively well-funded compared to 
their contributions to Japan's DALY, including neglected tropical diseases and 
malaria (funding vs DALY = 1.7% vs 0.0%, p<0.01) and neoplasms (28.5% vs 19.2%, 
p<0.001). In contrast, four GDB disease groups were significantly under-funded, 
including cardiovascular diseases (8.0% vs 14.8%, p<0.001) and musculoskeletal 
disorders (1.0% vs 11.9%, p<0.001). These percentages do not include 
unclassifiable funding.
CONCLUSIONS: While caution is necessary as this study was not able to consider 
public in-house funding and the methodological uncertainties could not be ruled 
out, the analysis may provide a snapshot of the limited alignment between 
publicly competitive disease-specific funding and the disease burden in the 
country. The results call for greater management over the allocation of scarce 
resources on health R&D. DALYs will serve as a crucial, but not the only, 
consideration in aligning Japan's research priorities with the public health 
needs. In addition, the algorithms for natural language processing used in this 
study require continued efforts to improve accuracy.

Lifetime and age-conditional risk estimates of end-stage kidney disease 
requiring maintenance dialysis in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Lifetime risk is an epidemiologic measure that expresses the 
probability of disease in the remaining lifetime for an index age. It is also an 
easily understandable statistical measure used to communicate the absolute risk 
of disease to the lay population. The lifetime risk of end-stage kidney disease 
(ESKD) has never been reported for the Japanese population. Here, we used data 
from the Japanese Society of Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) to estimate the lifetime 
risk of ESKD by sex in Japan.
METHODS: The lifetime risk of ESKD was estimated using life-table methods. We 
defined an incident case of ESKD as a patient with loss of kidney function that 
resulted in maintenance dialysis therapy. The number of incident cases of ESKD 
and number of ESKD deaths in 2017 were obtained from data published by the JSDT. 
The population and total number of deaths in Japan for the same year were 
obtained from National Vital Statistics. By including all-cause mortality, risks 
were adjusted for competing causes of death.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of ESKD from birth until age 95 years was 
3.14% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10-3.18] for men and 1.42% (1.39-1.44) for 
women. These probabilities illustrate that approximately 1 in 32 men and 1 in 71 
women in Japan will develop ESKD that results in maintenance dialysis therapy in 
their lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Considerable sex differences were found in the lifetime risk of 
ESKD in Japan. This easily understandable information could be used to assist in 
public health education and planning.

Growth hormone is a powerful metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects, which 
is positioned as a "source of youth". Somatotropin has various functions: 
stimulation of bone growth, regulation of carbohydrate, protein, lipid 
metabolism, metabolic function of the liver and energy balance. At the cellular 
level, somatotropic hormone regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, 
and cytoskeleton reorganization. The review article presents the results of 
topical studies that reflect the relationship of growth hormone deficiency or 
resistance to it with the development of aging and diseases associated with age, 
as well as with an increase in life expectancy.

Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) may be considered relatively uncommon disorders in the general population, 
but the precise incidence of AML in people living with HIV infection (PLWH) is 
uncertain. However, life expectancy of newly infected HIV-positive patients 
receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is gradually increasing, rivaling that 
of age-matched HIV-negative individuals, so that the occurrence of AML is also 
expected to progressively increase. Even if HIV is not reported to be directly 
mutagenic, several indirect leukemogenic mechanisms, mainly based on bone marrow 
microenvironment disruption, have been proposed. Despite a well-controlled HIV 
infection under ART should no longer be considered per se a contraindication to 
intensive chemotherapeutic approaches, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation, in selected fit patients with AML, survival outcomes are 
still generally unsatisfactory. We discussed several controversial issues about 
pathogenesis and clinical management of AML in PLWH, but few evidence-based 
answers may currently be provided, due to the limited number of cases reported 
in the literature, mainly as case reports or small retrospective case series. 
Prospective multicenter clinical trials are warranted to more precisely 
investigate epidemiology and cytogenetic/molecular features of AML in PLWH, but 
also to standardize and further improve its therapeutic management.

Adhesive capsulitis (AC) is a glenohumeral (GH) joint condition, characterized 
by decreased GH joint range of motion (ROM) and compensatory ROM in the elbow 
and scapulothoracic (ST) joint. To evaluate AC progression in clinical settings, 
objective movement analysis by available systems would be valuable. This study 
aimed to assess within-session and intra- and inter-operator 
reliability/agreement of such a motion capture system. The MVN-Awinda® system 
from Xsens Technologies (Enschede, The Netherlands) was used to assess ST, GH, 
and elbow ROM during four tasks (GH external rotation, combing hair, grasping a 
seatbelt, placing a cup on a shelf) in 10 AC patients (mean age = 54 (± 6), 7 
females), on two test occasions (accompanied by different operators on second 
occasion). Standard error of measurements (SEMs) were below 1.5° for ST 
pro-retraction and 4.6° for GH in-external rotation during GH external rotation; 
below 6.6° for ST tilt, 6.4° for GH flexion-extension, 7.1° for elbow 
flexion-extension during combing hair; below 4.4° for GH ab-adduction, 13° for 
GH in-external rotation, 6.8° for elbow flexion-extension during grasping the 
seatbelt; below 11° for all ST and GH joint rotations during placing a cup on a 
shelf. Therefore, to evaluate AC progression, inertial sensors systems can be 
applied during the execution of functional tasks.

Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) consisting of 
aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitors following percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI). CYP2C19 genotype can guide DAPT selection, prescribing ticagrelor or 
prasugrel for loss-of-function (LOF) allele carriers (genotype-guided 
escalation). Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) are traditionally grounded in 
clinical trial data. We conduct a CEA using real-world data using a 1-year 
decision-analytic model comparing primary strategies: universal empiric 
clopidogrel (base case), universal ticagrelor, and genotype-guided escalation. 
We also explore secondary strategies commonly implemented in practice, wherein 
all patients are prescribed ticagrelor for 30 days post PCI. After 30 days, all 
patients are switched to clopidogrel irrespective of genotype (nonguided 
de-escalation) or to clopidogrel only if patients do not harbor an LOF allele 
(genotype-guided de-escalation). Compared with universal clopidogrel, both 
universal ticagrelor and genotype-guided escalation were superior with 
improvement in quality-adjusted life years (QALY's). Only genotype-guided 
escalation was cost-effective ($42,365/QALY) and demonstrated the highest 
probability of being cost-effective across conventional willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. In the secondary analysis, compared with the nonguided de-escalation 
strategy, although genotype-guided de-escalation and universal ticagrelor were 
more effective, with ICER of $188,680/QALY and $678,215/QALY, respectively, they 
were not cost-effective. CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet prescribing is 
cost-effective compared with either universal clopidogrel or universal 
ticagrelor using real-world implementation data. The secondary analysis suggests 
genotype-guided and nonguided de-escalation may be viable strategies, needing 
further evaluation.

Pseudogenes were initially regarded as "nonfunctional" genomic elements that did 
not have protein-coding abilities due to several endogenous inactivating 
mutations. Although pseudogenes are widely expressed in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes, for decades, they have been largely ignored and classified as gene 
"junk" or "relics". With the widespread availability of high-throughput 
sequencing analysis, especially omics technologies, knowledge concerning 
pseudogenes has substantially increased. Pseudogenes are evolutionarily 
conserved and derive primarily from a mutation or retrotransposon, conferring 
the pseudogene with a "gene repository" role to store and expand genetic 
information. In contrast to previous notions, pseudogenes have a variety of 
functions at the DNA, RNA and protein levels for broadly participating in gene 
regulation to influence the development and progression of certain diseases, 
especially cancer. Indeed, some pseudogenes have been proven to encode proteins, 
strongly contradicting their "trash" identification, and have been confirmed to 
have tissue-specific and disease subtype-specific expression, indicating their 
own value in disease diagnosis. Moreover, pseudogenes have been correlated with 
the life expectancy of patients and exhibit great potential for future use in 
disease treatment, suggesting that they are promising biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets for clinical applications. In this review, we summarize the natural 
properties, functions, disease involvement and clinical value of pseudogenes. 
Although our knowledge of pseudogenes remains nascent, this field deserves more 
attention and deeper exploration.

INTRODUCTION: The life expectancy of HIV-infected patients has been increased by 
highly effective therapies. People living with HIV (PLWH) in Romania are exposed 
to age-related comorbidities occurring earlier than in uninfected individuals. 
Multidisciplinary care is required to maintain the general health and quality of 
life in these patients. Currently, the communication among different specialties 
needs to be enhanced and formalized.
METHODS: A panel consisting of 8 Romanian experts in infectious diseases, 
cardio-metabolic, bone, and kidney diseases and psychology met in May 2019 in 
Bucharest Romania to discuss the need to evaluate and monitor the most prevalent 
comorbidities in PLWH. The meeting resulted in practical guidance on the 
management of several non-infectious associated diseases. The algorithms were 
endorsed by the Society for Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS, Romania.
RESULTS: The consensus statement offers practical guidance on how to assess and 
monitor associated diseases in adult PLWH. The recommendations are grouped for 
each cluster of comorbidities and are based on international guidelines and 
clinical experience, including landmarks for referral of PLWH to cardiology, 
endocrinology, nephrology specialist or clinical psychologist for additional 
investigations and adequate treatment. Specific indications for diagnosis or 
treatment were beyond the scope of this consensus.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for associated diseases and adequate management are 
required to maintain the overall health status of PLWH. When implemented in 
clinical practice, the recommended algorithms should be used in addition to 
diagnosis and treatment guidelines and protocols. The infectious diseases 
specialist plays a key role in coordinating the overall treatment strategy and 
working within the multidisciplinary team.
