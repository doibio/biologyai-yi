When an antlion captures a foraging ant, the victim's nestmates may display 
rescue behaviour. This study tested the hypothesis that the expression of rescue 
behaviour depends on the life expectancy of the captured ant. This hypothesis 
predicts that the expression of rescue behaviour will be less frequent when the 
captured ant has a lower life expectancy than when it has a higher life 
expectancy because such a response would be adaptive at the colony level. 
Indeed, significant differences were found in the frequency of rescue behaviours 
in response to antlion victims with differing life expectancies. In agreement 
with prediction, victims with lower life expectancies were rescued less 
frequently, and those rescues had a longer latency and shorter duration. There 
was also a qualitative difference in the behaviour of rescuers to victims from 
the low and high life expectancy groups. Several explanations for these findings 
are proposed.

Fatigue is a ubiquitous and an extremely distressing symptom among patients with 
brain tumors (BT), particularly those with high-grade gliomas. The 
pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in the context of patients with 
BT is multifactorial and complex, involving biological, behavioral, medical and 
social factors. The etiology of CRF in the general oncology population is 
pointing to the role of inflammatory cytokines as a key factor in the genesis of 
CRF, but this research is currently limited in the setting of BT. CRF should be 
screened, assessed and managed according to clinical practice guidelines. 
Fatigue has recently emerged as a strong, independent prognostic factor for 
survival that provides incremental prognostic value to the traditional markers 
of prognosis in recurrent high-grade gliomas. Therefore, strategies to treat 
fatigue warrant investigation, not only to improve the QOL of a group of 
patients with often limited life expectancy, but also possibly to optimize 
survival.

OBJECTIVES: The paper aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) at the public published price for delayed-release dimethyl fumarate 
versus relevant Multiple Sclerosis disease-modifying therapies available in 
France in June 2015.
METHODS: The economic model was adapted to the French setting in accordance with 
the Haute Autorité de Santé guidelines using a model previously developed for 
NICE. A cohort of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients was simulated 
over a 30-year time horizon. Twenty one health states were taken into account: 
Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-9 for Relapsing Remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis patients, EDSS 0-9 for Secondary Progressive Multiple 
Sclerosis patients, and death. Estimates of relative treatment efficacy were 
determined using a mixed-treatment comparison. Probabilities of events were 
derived from the dimethyl fumarate pivotal clinical trials and the London 
Ontario Dataset. Costs and utilities were extracted from the published 
literature from both the payer and societal perspectives. Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of 
the model results.
RESULTS: From both perspectives, dimethyl fumarate and interferon beta-1a (IFN 
beta-1a) 44 mcg were the two optimal treatments, as the other treatments (IFN 
beta-1a 30 mcg, IFN beta-1b 250 mcg, teriflunomide, glatiramer acetate, 
fingolimod) were dominated on the efficiency frontier. From the societal 
perspective, dimethyl fumarate versus IFN beta-1a 44 mcg incurred an incremental 
cost of €3,684 and an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of 0.281, 
corresponding to an ICER of €13,110/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite no reference threshold for France, dimethyl fumarate can be 
considered as a cost-effective option as it is on the efficiency frontier.

BACKGROUND: The Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular 
Events (EVOLVE) clinical trial evaluated the effects of cinacalcet on clinical 
events in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) who were on 
hemodialysis. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed by a generic, 
preference-based health outcome measure (EQ-5D) at scheduled visits and after a 
study event. Here, we report the HRQoL analysis from EVOLVE.
METHODS: We assessed changes in HRQoL from baseline to scheduled visits, and 
estimated the acute (3 mo) and chronic (beyond 3 mo) effects of sHPT-related 
events on HRQoL using generalized estimating equation analysis controlling for 
baseline HRQoL and randomized assignment.
RESULTS: Data on HRQoL were available for 3547 of 3883 subjects, with 1650 
events in the placebo and 1502 in the cinacalcet arm. At the study end, no 
difference in change from baseline HRQoL was observed in the direct comparison 
of EQ-5D by treatment arms. The regression analysis showed significant effects 
of events on HRQoL and a modest positive effect of cinacalcet. Estimated 
quality-adjusted life-year gains were of similar magnitude based on the observed 
data or the predictions from the model, with only a small gain in precision from 
the predicted analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: By contrast with a conventional comparison, a regression analysis 
demonstrated large decrements in HRQoL after events and a modest improvement in 
HRQoL with cinacalcet. As randomized controlled trials are rarely powered to 
detect differences in HRQoL, a prespecified regression analysis may be 
acceptable to improve precision of the effects and understand their origin.

BACKGROUND: In 2013 in Mexico, gastric cancer (GC) was the third leading cause 
of death from cancer in individuals 20 years of age or older. GC remains a 
public health problem in Mexico due to its high mortality and low survival 
rates, and the significantly lower quality of life of patients with this 
condition.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine mortality trends 
nationwide, by state and socioeconomic region, and to determine rates of 
age-adjusted years of potential life lost due to GC, by state and socioeconomic 
region, within the period of 2000-2012.
METHODS: Mortality records associated with GC for 2000-2012 were obtained from 
the National Health Information System of the Mexican Department of Health. 
Codes from the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases 
corresponding to the basic cause of death from GC were identified. Mortality and 
age-adjusted years of potential life lost rates, by state and socioeconomic 
region, were also calculated.
RESULTS: In Mexico, 69,107 individuals died from GC within the time frame of 
2000-2012. The age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants decreased 
from 7.5 to 5.6. The male:female ratio was 1.15:1.0. Chiapas had the highest 
death rate from GC (9.2, 95% CI 8.2-10.3 [2000] and 8.2, 95% CI 7.3-9 [2012]), 
as well as regions 1, 2, and 5. Chiapas and socioeconomic region 1 had the 
highest rate of years of potential life lost.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the world population age distribution as the standard, the 
age-adjusted mortality rate in Mexico per 100,000 inhabitants that died from GC 
decreased from 7.5 to 5.6 between 2000 and 2012. Chiapas and socioeconomic 
regions 1, 2, and 5 had the highest mortality from GC (Chiapas: 9.2, 95% CI 
8.2-10.3 [2000] and 8.2, 95% CI 7.3-9 [2012], region 1: 5.5, 95% CI 5.2-5.9 
[2000] and 5.3, 95% CI 4.9-5.7 [2012]; region 2: 5.3, 95% CI 5-5.6 [2000] and 
5.4, 95% CI 5.1-5.8 [2012]; region 5: 6.1, 95% CI 5.6-6.6 [2000] and 4.6, 95% CI 
4.2-5 [2012]). Chiapas and socioeconomic region 1 had the highest rate of years 
of potential life lost (Chiapas: 97.4 [2000] and 79.6 [2012] and region 1: 73.5 
[2000] 65 [2012]).

In the lesser spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), as in most non-mammalian 
vertebrates, the dentition renews throughout life. To contribute to our 
understanding of how continuous tooth replacement is achieved, we searched for 
evidence for the presence of stem cells in this species. Three-dimensional 
reconstructions of juvenile (2-3 weeks post-hatch) specimens showed that tooth 
families merge imperceptibly with so-called interdental zones within a 
continuous and permanent dental lamina. Interdental regions are composed of 
three layers, continuous with cervical loop, middle, and outer dental epithelium 
of the tooth families, respectively. A BrdU pulse-chase experiment revealed that 
cell proliferation is initiated in the lingual part of the dental lamina and the 
resulting population shifts one tooth position towards the oral epithelium in 
around four to five weeks. In the longest chase time (114 days) label-retaining 
and arguably non-differentiated cells were present at the lingual border of the 
dental lamina. These were found in the outer and middle dental epithelium, both 
within and between tooth families. This area of the dental lamina did not show 
expression or distribution of Sox2. Our data support the hypothesis that stem 
cells reside at the lingual border of the continuous dental lamina, more 
specifically in the middle dental epithelium at the level of the tooth families, 
and in its extension between the tooth families. To demonstrate their true 
stemness and their role in continuous tooth replacement, it remains to be shown 
that these cells have the potential to give rise to a complete new successor.

The neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) is considered critical for the 
regulation of endogenous IgG and serum albumin (SA) and their circulation 
half-life in vivo. Both IgG and SA can bind to FcRn tightly at acidic pH but not 
so much at neutral pH. Here we reported a few novel single chain antibody 
fragments (scFv) obtained based on screening of a phage library. FnAb-8 and 
FnAb-12 can bind to human FcRn with higher affinities than IgG at acidic pH but 
similar or lower affinities than IgG at pH7.4. Fusion proteins consisted of the 
therapeutic peptide, GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) connected to the N-terminus 
of FnAb-8 and FnAb-12, named as G8 and G12, were shown to retain the 
pH-dependent binding capabilities to FcRn while also bound to the GLP-1 
receptor. In vivo efficacy studies in diet induced diabetes mice confirmed the 
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist activities and sustained blood sugar lowering 
effect. In vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) studies were performed in nonhuman 
primates and FnAb-8 was found to have circulation half-life several folds longer 
than what have been reported for scFvs. G8 may be developed into long acting 
GLP-1R agonists with great potentials in clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: This study contributes to dialogue on quality versus quantity of 
life by examining years older persons can expect to live in various states of 
pain.
METHODS: Data from seven waves of the Health and Retirement Study; N = 26,896; 
age 55+. Estimations using the Interpolative Markov Chain approach apply 
probability transitions to multistate life table functions. Two estimates are 
interpreted: (i) population-based, which provide population averages aggregated 
across baseline states and (ii) status-based, which provide independent 
estimates by baseline state. Age- and sex-specific years with no pain, milder 
nonlimiting, and severe or limiting pain are reported as is percent of life in 
states of pain.
RESULTS: Females have higher life expectancy than males but similar expectations 
of pain-free life. Total life expectancy varies only slightly by baseline pain 
states but pain-free life expectancy varies greatly. For example, an 85-year-old 
female pain-free at baseline expects 7.04 more years, 5.28 being pain-free. An 
85-year-old female with severe pain at baseline expects 6.42 years with only 
2.66 pain-free. Percent of life with pain decreases by age for those pain-free 
at baseline and increases for those with pain at baseline.
CONCLUSION: Pain is moderately associated with quantity of or total life but 
substantially and importantly associated with quality of or pain-free life.

INTRODUCTION: Immune dysregulation is suggested to play an important 
aetiological role in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) potentially 
driving neurodevelopmental pathways. Immune dysfunction may precede the onset of 
psychiatric disorders and parallel the development of multiaxial comorbidity, 
including suicidal behaviour and metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Depicting 
the source of the chronic low-grade inflammatory component in SZ and BD is thus 
a research priority. Strong environmental insults early in life, such as 
infections, acting on a background of genetic vulnerability, may induce potent 
and enduring inflammatory responses setting a state of liability to second-hit 
environmental encounters, namely childhood trauma, drug abuse or additional 
infectious exposures. The immunogenetic background of susceptibility, suggested 
to be not only lying within the HLA locus but also implicating inherited 
deficits of the innate immune system, may amplify the harmful biological effects 
of infections/psychosocial stress leading to the manifestation of a broad range 
of psychiatric symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The present review aims to discuss the following: (i) biological 
arguments in favour of a chronic low-grade inflammation in SZ and BD and its 
potential origin in the interaction between the immunogenetic background and 
environmental infectious insults, and (ii) the consequences of this inflammatory 
dysfunction by focusing on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies and 
activation of the family of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs).
CONCLUSIONS: Specific therapeutic approaches targeting immune pathways may lead 
the way to novel personalized medical interventions, improvement of quality of 
life and average life expectancy of psychiatric patients, if not even prevent 
mood episodes and psychotic symptoms.

The aging of the population is accompanied by a sharp rise of chronic disease 
prevalences, such as dementia. These diseases generally cannot be prevented or 
cured and persist over time, with a progressive deterioration of health, 
requiring specific care. To reduce the burden of these diseases, it is 
appropriate to propose interventions targeting disease risk factors, but the 
association between most of these risk factors and mortality makes it difficult 
to anticipate the potential impact of such interventions. A method was 
previously proposed to estimate changes in disease prevalence following an 
intervention targeting subjects at a given age where the incidence of the 
disease is supposed to be null. Here, we propose a general framework to make 
projections for life expectancies with and without the disease, the age at 
onset, and the lifelong probability of the disease, and to evaluate the 
consequences of preventive interventions targeting risk factors on these various 
measures of disease burden. The methodology takes into account the mortality 
trend over calendar time and age in both healthy and diseased subjects, and the 
change in mortality due to the intervention. The method is applied to make 
projections for dementia in 2030 according to several scenarios of public health 
interventions.

Perioperative and palliative chemotherapy for esophageal carcinoma has undergone 
substantial changes in recent years. The implementation of trastuzumab in the 
treatment of HER2-positive advanced adenocarcinoma is a milestone as it marked 
the introduction of the first molecularly targeted treatment of gastric cancer. 
Current studies are investigating whether anti-HER2-directed treatment also 
proves effective in the perioperative setting. Data from the CROSS study on 
neoadjuvant radio-/chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin have helped to 
establish a new standard of care for the treatment of localized esophageal 
cancer. Finally, preliminary experience in potentially curative treatment 
approaches for oligometastatic tumor stages may offer new treatment options for 
patients with stage IV gastric cancer. However, some of these innovative 
approaches urgently require validation in larger, prospective, and controlled 
multicenter studies. Highly active forms of radiotherapy, radio-/chemotherapy, 
or chemoimmunotherapy can achieve complete tumor remissions in some patients. 
Despite these advances, life expectancy unfortunately continues to be very 
limited in the majority of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
esophageal carcinoma.

Metastatic choroid melanoma is a highly malignant disease with a limited life 
expectancy. The liver is the most common site for metastasis of uveal melanoma 
followed by lung, bone, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Metastasis from choroidal 
melanoma usually occurs within the first five years of treatment for primary 
tumours. Metastatic choroid melanoma to the spine/vertebrae is extremely rare. 
We report the first case of spinal metastasis from choroid melanoma in a 
61-year-old man who had been treated for primary ocular melanoma three years 
earlier with radioactive plaque brachytherapy. Synchronously, at the time of 
metastasis, he was also diagnosed as having a new primary lung adenocarcinoma as 
well. The only other case reported on vertebral metastasis from malignant 
melanoma of choroid in literature in which primary choroid melanoma was 
enucleated.

The treatment of choice between coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has remained unclear. Considering 
quality of life (QOL) increases life expectancy, we believe QOL should be 
important in determining the optimum treatment. Thus the objective of this 
review was to illustrate the comparative effects of CABG and PCI on 
postprocedural QOL. Methods. We searched PubMed (Medline) and Embase from 
inception of the databases to May 2014 using "PCI versus CABG quality of life", 
"Percutaneous Coronary intervention versus Coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
Quality of life", "PCI versus CABG health status", "Angioplasty versus CABG", 
"Percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass surgery health 
status", and different combinations of the above terms. 447 articles were found. 
After applying strict exclusion criteria, we included 13 studies in this review. 
Results. From the 9 studies that compared QOL scores at 6 months after 
procedure, 5 studies reported CABG to be superior. From the 10 studies that 
compared QOL among patients at 1 year after procedure, 9 reported CABG to be 
superior. Conclusion. It can be established that CABG is superior to PCI in 
improving patient's QOL with respect to all scales used to determine quality of 
life.

Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in improving black 
men's health and the health disparities affecting them. Yet, the health of black 
men consistently ranks lowest across nearly all groups in the United States. 
Evidence on the health and social causes of morbidity and mortality among black 
men has been narrowly concentrated on public health problems (e.g., violence, 
prostate cancer, and HIV/AIDS) and determinants of health (e.g., education and 
male gender socialization). This limited focus omits age-specific leading causes 
of death and other social determinants of health, such as discrimination, 
segregation, access to health care, employment, and income. This review 
discusses the leading causes of death for black men and the associated risk 
factors, as well as identifies gaps in the literature and presents a racialized 
and gendered framework to guide efforts to address the persistent inequities in 
health affecting black men.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The high cost of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) direct-acting 
antivirals (DAAs) poses significant financial challenges for health payers, 
especially in Asia. A personalized treatment strategy based on individualized 
probability of virological response using oral DAAs as second-line therapy would 
seem practical but has not been studied.
METHODS: We performed a Markov model to project health outcomes and costs for 
patients with genotype 1 HCV through 10 treatment strategies over a lifetime 
period. The implication of retreatment was also incorporated to reflect 
real-life situation.
RESULTS: Using boceprevir and peginterferon/ribavirin (BOC/PR, the least costly 
treatment) as a base case, the all-oral therapies such as 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir-dasabuvir are cost-effective with an 
incremental cost-effective ratio of $US50 828. However, the all-oral DAAs would 
no longer be cost-effective compared with conventional therapies if retreatment 
were taken into account. A road map strategy using rapid virological response to 
guide use of BOC/PR and sofosbuvir/PR had the most favorable incremental 
cost-effective ratio ($US27 782) relative to BOC/PR. Nevertheless, the trade-off 
with the cost-effectiveness of the road map strategy is an increased number of 
liver-related deaths compared with all-oral DAAs (52 vs 10-20 per 10 000 
patients) by incorporating retreatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week all-oral DAAs were cost-effective options using 
conventional drug-to-drug comparison. However, they cease to be cost-effective 
when treatment strategies incorporating DAA retreatment for interferon failures 
are incorporated. HCV management can be optimized by adopting individualized 
treatment algorithm providing a practical solution to health payers to make oral 
DAAs accessible to those who need them most.

AIMS: To determine whether the provision of contingency management using 
financial incentives to improve hepatitis B vaccine completion in people who 
inject drugs entering community treatment represents a cost-effective use of 
health-care resources.
DESIGN: A probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted, using a 
decision-tree to estimate the short-term clinical and health-care cost impact of 
the vaccination strategies, followed by a Markov process to evaluate the 
long-term clinical consequences and costs associated with hepatitis B infection.
SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on attendance to vaccination from a UK cluster 
randomized trial.
INTERVENTION: Two contingency management options were examined in the trial: 
fixed versus escalating schedule financial incentives.
MEASUREMENT: Life-time health-care costs and quality-adjusted life years 
discounted at 3.5% annually; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
FINDINGS: The resulting estimate for the incremental life-time health-care cost 
of the contingency management strategy versus usual care was £21.86 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) = -£12.20 to 39.86] per person offered the incentive. 
For 1000 people offered the incentive, the incremental reduction in numbers of 
hepatitis B infections avoided over their lifetime was estimated at 19 (95% 
CI = 8-30). The probabilistic incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year 
gained of the contingency management programme was estimated to be £6738 (95% 
CI = £6297-7172), with an 89% probability of being considered cost-effective at 
a threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life years gained (97.60% at 
£30 000).
CONCLUSIONS: Using financial incentives to increase hepatitis B vaccination 
completion in people who inject drugs could be a cost-effective use of 
health-care resources in the UK as long as the incidence remains above 1.2%.

Growth hormone (GH) signaling stimulates the production of IGF-1; however, 
increased GH signaling may induce insulin resistance and can reduce life 
expectancy in both mice and humans. Interestingly, disruption of GH signaling by 
reducing plasma GH levels significantly improves health span and extends 
lifespan in mice, as observed in Ames dwarf mice. In addition, these mice have 
increased adiposity, yet are more insulin sensitive compared to control mice. 
Metabolic stressors such as high-fat diet (HFD) promote obesity and may alter 
longevity through the GH signaling pathway. Therefore, our objective was to 
investigate the effects of a HFD (metabolic stressor) on genetic mechanisms that 
regulate metabolism during aging. We show that Ames dwarf mice fed HFD for 
12 weeks had an increase in subcutaneous and visceral adiposity as a result of 
diet-induced obesity, yet are more insulin sensitive and have higher levels of 
adiponectin compared to control mice fed HFD. Furthermore, energy expenditure 
was higher in Ames dwarf mice fed HFD than in control mice fed HFD. 
Additionally, we show that transplant of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) 
from Ames dwarf mice fed HFD into control mice fed HFD improves their insulin 
sensitivity. We conclude that Ames dwarf mice are resistant to the detrimental 
metabolic effects of HFD and that visceral adipose tissue of Ames dwarf mice 
improves insulin sensitivity in control mice fed HFD.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this work was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to medical therapy for patients with 
chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
METHODS: The study design consisted of a microsimulation Markov decision-tree 
economic model with a 31-year time horizon. A cohort of 489 patients who 
underwent ESS for CRS were matched 1 to 1 with a cohort of 489 patients from the 
national Medical Expenditures Panel Survey database who underwent medical 
management for CRS. Utility scores were calculated from responses to the EuroQol 
5-Dimension instrument in both cohorts. Decision-tree analysis and a subsequent 
10-state Markov model utilized published event probabilities as well as primary 
data from a large multisurgeon prospective outcomes study to calculate long-term 
costs and utility. The primary outcome measure was incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ESS vs medical 
therapy alone was $13,851.26 per QALY. The cost effectiveness acceptability 
curve demonstrated 85.84% and 98.69% certainty that the ESS strategy was the 
most cost-effective option at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $25,000 and 
$50,000 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study shows ESS to be a cost-effective intervention compared to 
medical therapy alone for the management of patients with CRS.

OBJECTIVE: Women with active sunlight exposure habits experience a lower 
mortality rate than women who avoid sun exposure; however, they are at an 
increased risk of skin cancer. We aimed to explore the differences in main 
causes of death according to sun exposure.
METHODS: We assessed the differences in sun exposure as a risk factor for 
all-cause mortality in a competing risk scenario for 29 518 Swedish women in a 
prospective 20-year follow-up of the Melanoma in Southern Sweden (MISS) cohort. 
Women were recruited from 1990 to 1992 (aged 25-64 years at the start of the 
study). We obtained detailed information at baseline on sun exposure habits and 
potential confounders. The data were analysed using modern survival statistics.
RESULTS: Women with active sun exposure habits were mainly at a lower risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and noncancer/non-CVD death as compared to those 
who avoided sun exposure. As a result of their increased survival, the relative 
contribution of cancer death increased in these women. Nonsmokers who avoided 
sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun 
exposure group, indicating that avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor for 
death of a similar magnitude as smoking. Compared to the highest sun exposure 
group, life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure was reduced by 0.6-2.1 years.
CONCLUSION: The longer life expectancy amongst women with active sun exposure 
habits was related to a decrease in CVD and noncancer/non-CVD mortality, causing 
the relative contribution of death due to cancer to increase.

In this part of the series we explain the detailed literature review and the 
calculations of impacts and damage costs of mercury and lead. Methodology and 
general assumptions are explained in the companion article, Part 1 of this 
series, and the spreadsheet with the calculations is available as a 
supplementary file of Part 1.3 For mercury, the damage cost is 22,937 €2013 /kg 
if there is a no-effect threshold, 52,129 €2013 /kg if there is none; 91% is due 
to mortality from heart disease, the rest from loss of IQ points. For lead, the 
damage cost is 29,343 €2013 /kg, about 80% due to mortality and 20% due to IQ 
loss; there does not seem to be a no-effect threshold. These costs are per kg of 
emitted pollutant.

Amylosucrase (ASase; EC 2.4.1.4) synthesizes α-1,4-glucans using sucrose as a 
sole substrate. The aim of this study was to compare the enzymatic properties of 
four recombinant ASase genes to determine the underlying mechanisms thereof. 
Following cloning and expression in Escherichia coli, we determined that the 
ASase enzyme from Deinococcus geothermalis (DGAS) had the highest 
thermostability whereas ASase from Neisseria polysaccharea (NPAS) showed the 
greatest polymerization activity. Chimeric ASases were constructed using dgas 
and npas genes by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. Two of the six 
chimeric ASases generated, NPAS-B' and DGAS-B, showed ASase activity using 
sucrose as the sole substrate. However, DGAS-B was not able to produce longer 
α-1,4-glucans; the highest degree of polymerization was <12. In the kinetic 
study, not only the substrate binding affinity but also the production rate of 
DGAS-B was greater than those of DGAS. Molecular dynamic computational 
simulation suggested that DGAS-B could not synthesize longer glucan chains 
because of the change in flexibilities of loops 4, 7, and 8as compared to those 
of DGAS.

INTRODUCTION: The socioeconomic impact of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea 
syndrome (OSAHS) is considerable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of treating OSAHS with continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) and the impact of CPAP compliance.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-crossover study of 373 patients with 
OSAHS receiving CPAP. We compared changes in costs, Epworth score and 
health-related quality of life (EQ-5D questionnaires) between the year before 
treatment and the year after treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) for the first year of treatment was estimated, and projections were made 
for the second year, using different effectiveness and cost scenarios.
RESULTS: The visual analog scale score for the EQ-5D questionnaire increased by 
5 points and the Epworth score fell by 10 points during the year of CPAP 
treatment. Mean gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was 0.05 per patient 
per year (P<.001): 0.07 among compliers and -0.04 among non-compliers. ICER was 
€51,147/QALY during the first year of CPAP treatment and €1,544/QALY during the 
second year.
CONCLUSION: CPAP treatment in patients with moderate-severe OSAHS improves the 
quality of life of compliant patients, and is cost-effective as of the second 
year.
