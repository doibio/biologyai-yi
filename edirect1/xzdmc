ostia may render coronary access particularly difficult, and thus personalized 
decisions regarding THV type and implanting techniques are of paramount 
importance to secure future coronary access. Since bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) 
stenosis may be associated with unfavorable anatomic factors, it has represented 
an exclusion criterion in major randomized TAVR trials. Albeit promising data 
are available from multicenter registries, results of specifically designed 
randomized trials are eagerly needed to inform use of TAVR for BAV stenosis. 
Although valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVR has emerged as an effective treatment option 
for degenerated aortic bioprostheses, ViV procedures are associated with 
specific risks, which mandated the development of specific techniques aimed at 
reducing the occurrence of periprocedural adverse events. Despite the 
transfemoral approach represents the access of choice for TAVR, a significant 
proportion of patients have significant peripheral artery disease and 
alternative vascular access routes have been increasingly evaluated with 
encouraging data regarding their safety and feasibility.

Publisher: Mit dem Erreichen von 20 Jahren klinischer Erfahrung im 
kathetergestützen Aortenklappenersatz (TAVR) hat sich eine riesige Menge 
klinischer Daten hoher Qualität angesammelt, die die Sicherheit und Wirksamkeit 
der TAVR für das ganze Spektrum chirurgischer Risiken bestätigen. Obwohl viele 
Aspekte dieser innovativen Therapie gründlich untersucht wurden, bleiben 
verschiedene Herausforderungen. Da die Indikation zur TAVR zunehmend auch auf 
jüngere Low-Risk-Patienten mit höherer Lebenserwartung ausgedehnt wird, stellt 
die Lebensdauer der Transkatheter-Herzklappen (THV) ein großes ungelöstes 
Problem dar, denn robuste Daten dazu sind derzeit auf etwa 5–6 Jahre begrenzt. 
Außerdem können sterische Wechselwirkungen zwischen THV-Komponenten und 
Koronarostien den Koronarzugang sehr erschweren, daher sind personalisierte 
Entscheidungen in Bezug auf THV-Typ und Implantationstechniken von großer 
Bedeutung zur Sicherung eines zukünftigen Koronarzugangs. Da eine Stenose einer 
bikuspiden Aortenklappe (BAV) möglicherweise mit ungünstigen anatomischen 
Faktoren einhergeht, gilt sie als Ausschlusskriterium in größeren randomisierten 
TAVR-Studien. Trotz vielversprechender Daten aus Multi-Zentrums-Registern sind 
dringend Ergebnisse speziell designter randomisierter Studien erforderlich zur 
Information über den Einsatz von TAVR bei BAV-Stenose. Auch wenn sich die 
Valve-in-Valve(VIV)-TAVR als wirksame Therapieoption für degenerierte 
Aortenbioprothesen erwiesen hat, gehen damit spezifische Risiken einher, welche 
die Entwicklung spezifischer Techniken erfordern, deren Ziel die Verminderung 
periprozeduraler Nebenwirkungen ist. Der transfemorale Zugangsweg ist zwar der 
Zugang der Wahl bei TAVR, doch weist ein erheblicher Teil der Patienten eine 
relevante periphere Arteriosklerose auf; daher werden zunehmend alternative 
Gefäßzugänge untersucht – mit ermutigenden Daten zur Sicherheit und Machbarkeit.

Globally, there has been a marked increase in longevity, but it is also apparent 
that significant inequalities remain, especially the inequality related to 
insufficient 'health' to enjoy or at least survive those later years. The major 
causes include lack of access to proper nutrition and healthcare services, and 
often the basic information to make the personal decisions related to diet and 
healthcare options and opportunities. Proper nutrition can be the best predictor 
of a long healthy life expectancy and, conversely, when inadequate and/or 
improper a prognosticator of a sharply curtailed expectancy. There is a 
dichotomy in both developed and developing countries as their populations are 
experiencing the phenomenon of being 'over fed and under nourished', i.e., 
caloric/energy excess and lack of essential nutrients, leading to health 
deficiencies, skyrocketing global obesity rates, excess chronic diseases, and 
premature mortality. There is need for new and/or innovative approaches to 
promoting health as individuals' age, and for public health programs to be a 
proactive blessing and not an archaic status quo 'eat your vegetables' mandate. 
A framework for progress has been proposed and published by the World Health 
Organization in their Global Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health (WHO 
(2017) Advancing the right to health: the vital role of law.

INTRODUCTION: Adult onset diabetes is a significant health issue in rural 
communities that are disproportionately suffering from the health, social and 
financial costs of the disease. Despite this, over half of rural counties in the 
USA lack access to diabetes self-management programs, which are effective at 
improving diabetes management. The Cooperative Extension System &#40;CES&#41; is 
a nationwide education network that provides research-based information and 
programs in nearly 3000 counties in the USA to improve the health and wellbeing 
of rural and urban communities. This study evaluated the implementation and 
outcomes of a lifestyle management program, Balanced Living with Diabetes (BLD) 
conducted by community-based educators who are part of the CES in rural 
Virginia, to address the gap in diabetes education in these communities. BLD is 
grounded in social cognitive theory and has shown efficacy to modify dietary and 
physical activity behaviors resulting in improved glycemic control in people 
with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: The study evaluated the implementation and effectiveness of BLD 
programs conducted by the CES in 16 rural counties over 2 years. Program 
adoption, reach, context, and barriers and facilitators to implementation were 
evaluated through program outcome data and extension educator interviews. 
Program outcomes included change in weight, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), 
diabetes knowledge, self-management practices, diet and physical activity 
behaviors, and self-efficacy from baseline to 12-week assessment.
RESULTS: Extension educators conducted 30 programs, reaching 290 residents, with 
a 58% mean retention rate. The program resulted in a significant increase in 
diabetes and food knowledge, fruit, vegetable, and whole grain intake, use of 
the plate method, exercise, and diabetes management self-efficacy. A1C decreased 
significantly in participants with diabetes (mean reduction=0.345&plusmn;1.013; 
p=0.001). The program was conducted twice in 11 counties, and once in five 
counties. Barriers to program adoption in the five counties included limited 
community interest, competing program priorities of the extension educator, and 
loss of extension personnel to conduct the program. Participant communication 
materials and systems to enhance program sustainability were developed in 
response to educator feedback. Process evaluation indicated that the program was 
highly acceptable to extension educators and program participants.
CONCLUSION: The CES is an effective network for implementation of diabetes 
lifestyle-management programs in underserved communities, and the BLD program is 
effective at increasing lifestyle behaviors and self-efficacy that improve 
glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. Collaboration by Virginia's CES 
with a variety of community partners, including healthcare and social service 
providers, increases the reach and sustainability of extension diabetes 
programs. The CES in the USA is well positioned to fill the gap in diabetes 
education in rural communities as part of a chronic care model.

INTRODUCTION: Efficacy of lenalidomide plus rituximab (R-LEN) compared to 
rituximab monotherapy (R-mono) for patients with previously treated follicular 
lymphoma (FL) was investigated in AUGMENT (NCT01938001). Our aim was to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of R-LEN versus R-mono in this setting from a Dutch 
perspective.
AREAS COVERED: Cost-effectiveness was assessed through a partitioned survival 
model from three perspectives (i.e. societal, healthcare, and societal, 
including future non-medical costs). Patient-level data from AUGMENT informed 
effectiveness parameters (i.e. long-term survival) and health state utilities. 
Resource use and prices were based on AUGMENT and the literature. Clinical 
experts validated efficacy input parameters and results. Uncertainty was 
explored through sensitivity and scenario analyses.
EXPERT OPINION: R-LEN resulted in 1.7 incremental discounted quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Total incremental discounted costs were 67,161 EUR from a 
societal perspective. In conclusion, R-LEN was cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 50,000 EUR/QALY in the base-case 
analyses(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = 40,493 EUR/QALY). Scenario and 
sensitivity analyses indicated some level of uncertainty regarding this 
conclusion, depending on the chosen WTP-threshold and perspective.

Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the most important pests of 
agricultural crops with worldwide distribution causing considerable damage to 
different products. Application of chemical acaricides is one of the most 
important strategies used for the control of this pest. Entomopathogenic fungi, 
however, have been proposed as alternative control agents. In this study, 
sub-lethal effects (LC10 = 6.76 × 102, LC20 = 8.74 × 103, and LC30 = 55.38 × 103 
conidia ml-1) of Beauveria bassiana strain TV on the life table parameters of T. 
urticae were evaluated under laboratory conditions. The results demonstrated 
that by increasing the concentration, a significant decline was observed in 
adult longevity of both male and female individuals. Total fecundity of T. 
urticae was calculated as 45.16, 36.28, 23.98, and 18.21 eggs in control, LC10, 
LC20, and LC30 treatments, respectively. Sub-lethal concentrations drastically 
affected the population parameters of this mite pest. The intrinsic rate of 
increase (r) ranged from 0.1983 to 0.1688 day-1 for the mites treated with 
distilled water and LC20 treatments, respectively. The net reproductive rate 
(R0) was affected by the sub-lethal concentrations (lower value at LC30 
concentration: 11.19 offspring/individual). Considering the detrimental effects 
of B. bassiana on some biological parameters of T. urticae, it can be concluded 
that this product can be used to develop targeted interventions aimed at 
integrated pest management of this pest.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
lurasidone among patients with schizophrenia in a 12-week open-label extension 
study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who completed a 6-week, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study were enrolled in a 12-week open-label extension study 
with flexible dosing of lurasidone at 40 or 80 mg/day. Safety assessments 
included adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram 
(ECG) parameters. Effectiveness measures included the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale 
(CGI-S), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and quality of life 
measure.
RESULTS: A total of 289 patients were enrolled in the open-label extension 
study. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were low; akathisia 
was the most common TEAE with an incidence of 6.6%. There were 54 patients 
(18.7%) who discontinued the extension study, with 17 (5.9%) discontinuing due 
to adverse events. Minimal or no effects of lurasidone on weight, body mass 
index, metabolic parameters, prolactin, and ECG parameters were evident. There 
was continued improvement to week 12 in PANSS and CGI-S scores beyond the 
initial gains made during the prior 6-week double-blind study. Non-responders to 
lurasidone 40 mg/day in the prior 6-week study showed a mean (standard 
deviation) improvement from open-label baseline of 10.7 (13.8) points on the 
PANSS total score after lurasidone dose was increased to a modal dose of 80 
mg/day during the extension study. Changes from double-blind baseline in CDSS 
and quality of life were maintained in the extension study.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with lurasidone 40 or 80 mg once daily (flexibly dosed) 
continued to be well tolerated with patients demonstrating further improvement 
in symptoms over the course of a 12-week open-label extension study in patients 
with schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal osteoporosis, a common yet chronic systemic metabolic 
disease, has become a major public health problem due to life expectancy 
increasing around the world. The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) into osteoblasts, and the differentiation of circulating monocyte cells 
into osteoclasts, play an important role in the balance of bone metabolism. 
However, when both undergo pathological changes, it can lead to abnormalities, 
resulting in osteoporosis. This study aims to explore a new biomarker for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis, thereby providing a new entry point for 
bioinformatic research into the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
METHODS: Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, microarray analysis 
was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes in MSCs and monocytes 
in both postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and a healthy control group. The 
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database 
was used to analyze the function and enrichment of the selected genes, and a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed from the Search Tool 
for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) website and displayed 
in Cytoscape. To achieve the final results, module analysis of the PPI network 
was performed by using Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE).
RESULTS: We identified 45 high-expression and 26 low-expression genes through 
the study, all of which underwent pathway enrichment analysis. This enrichment 
was observed in the cell cycle regulation, osteoclast differentiation, tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and RNA transport. The top 10 hub genes 
of the PPI network were SF3B1, SRSF5, FUBP1, SRSF3, TIA1, KHSRP, LUC7L3, PNN, 
SRC, and ATRX. Comparing the MSCs and monocytes between the postmenopausal 
osteoporosis patients and the healthy control group, we noted that the 
expression of the above genes differed greatly.
CONCLUSIONS: Through bioinformatic analysis and clinical specimen validation, 
our study provides a new way for exploring the pathogenesis of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis. Most importantly, it suggests that the hub genes, SF3B1, SRSF5, 
FUBP1, KHSRP, and SRC, may become new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets 
for diagnosing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis in the future.

BACKGROUND: The latest published CASPIAN trial demonstrated that adding 
durvalumab to etoposide and platinum (EP) improved survival dramatically for 
patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Considering the 
high cost of durvalumab, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
durvalumab plus EP (DEP) in the first-line setting for treatment-naïve patients 
with ES-SCLC from the U.S. payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a three-state Markov model to simulate the 
disease course and source consumption of ES-SCLC over a lifetime horizon. 
Pseudo-individual patient-level data were generated from digitized Kaplan-Meier 
curves. Direct medical costs, including drug and administration costs, disease 
management and adverse events treatment fees, best supportive care and terminal 
care costs were obtained from sources including the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and relevant 
literature. Health state utility values were derived from published literature. 
Main outcomes considered were total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted 
LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). All costs were 
adjusted for inflation to reflect 2019 U.S. dollars. The willingness-to-pay 
threshold was set as $150,000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were used to explore the uncertainty of model assumptions.
RESULTS: Compared with EP, DEP was projected to increase life expectancy by 0.86 
LYs (1.73 vs. 0.87) and 0.44 QALYs (0.93 vs. 0.49). The incremental treatment 
cost was $95,907, and the corresponding ICER was $216,953/QALY. The result was 
most sensitive to the variation of durvalumab acquisition cost. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of DEP over EP regimen to be 
cost-effective was 9.4% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. In 
the case of reducing the price of durvalumab by 30.7%, DEP was more 
cost-effective than EP.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the U.S. payer, adding durvalumab to EP is 
estimated to be not cost-effective compared with EP alone for patients with 
untreated ES-SCLC.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The information provided by this analysis serves as a 
reference for decision makers. Lowering the price of durvalumab would be a 
potential measure to improve the economics of durvalumab plus etoposide and 
platinum (DEP), and the inclusion of durvalumab in the Medicare pharmacopeia 
could make DEP more economically available. These results may also guide 
physicians and patients to choose the most economically feasible treatment.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the deadliest cancer worldwide 
with a 98% loss-of-life expectancy and a 30% increase in the disability-adjusted 
life years during the last decade in Europe. The disease cannot be effectively 
prevented nor being early detected. When diagnosed, 80% of patients have tumors 
that are in incurable stages, while for those who undergo surgery, 80% of 
patients will present with local or distant metastasis. Importantly, 
chemotherapies are far from being effective.
OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer represents a great challenge and, at the same time, 
a huge opportunity for advancing our understanding on the basis of the disease, 
the molecular profiles, that would lead to develop tools for early detection and 
effective treatments, thus, boosting patient survival.
RESULTS: Research on pancreatic cancer has being receiving little or minimal 
funds from European funding bodies. UEG is calling for public-private 
partnerships that would effectively fund research on pancreatic cancer.
CONCLUSION: This would increase our understanding of this disease and better 
treatment, through pan-European efforts that take advantage of the strong 
academic European research landscape on pancreatic cancer, and the contribution 
by the industry of all sizes.

Tissue iron overload is a life-threatening scenario in children with 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major, miRNAs that are involved in iron 
hemostasis could serve as therapeutic targets for control of iron overload. We 
aimed to find out the association between three iron-related miRNAs "miR-let-7d, 
miR-122, and miR-200b" and excess iron in tissues, in transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassemia major patients. Circulating miRNA expressions are measured in 
peripheral blood (PB) samples using qPCR of transfusion-dependent (TDT) 
β-thalassemia patients (n = 140) and normalized to non-transfusion-dependent 
(NTDT) β-thalassemia (n = 45). Results revealed that plasma expression levels of 
miR-let-7d and miR-200b were significantly downregulated in TDT patients; 
however, miR-122 was upregulated. In terms of tissue iron load, aberrant 
expression of miRNAs was significantly associated with increased-iron 
accumulation in hepatic and cardiac tissues. We concluded that circulating 
miRNAs are strong candidates that associate iron hemostasis in 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major patients. And by extension, targeting 
miR-let-7d, miR-122, and miR-200 might serve as novel sensitive, specific and 
non-invasive predictor biomarkers for cellular damage under condition of tissue 
iron excess.

Spiraxis interstrialis, and its junior synonym Fayolia mourloni, an uppermost 
Famennian (Upper Devonian) fossil first described as algae and subsequently 
interpreted as the oldest known chondrichthyan egg case, is reinvestigated based 
on the discovery of several additional specimens in Belgian collections. New 
data, in particular from micro-CT imaging, allow to refute S. interstrialis, and 
by extension also Spiraxis major (the type species of Spiraxis Newberry, non 
Adams) and Spiraxis randalli from the Famennian of New York and Pennsylvania, as 
chondrichthyan egg cases. Alternative interpretations of these enigmatic 
helicoidal fossils are discussed. The first occurrence of oviparity in the 
fossil record of chondrichthyans is thus not as old as previously thought and is 
close to the first occurrence of viviparity in this group, both being recognised 
now in the Mississippian. The question of which of both conditions is 
plesiomorphic within chondrichthyans, and more widely within vertebrates, is 
discussed. Also, the presence of the genus Spiraxis in both the USA (east coast) 
and Belgium reinforces the strong faunal resemblance already observed in both 
palaeogeographical areas. It suggests important faunal exchanges between these 
regions of the Euramerica landmass during the Famennian.

Center, Houston, Texas.

BACKGROUND: Agitated delirium is common and highly distressing. Medications are 
often needed to reduce agitation, but it is unclear what the desired level of 
sedation is. This study assessed personalized sedation goals (PSGs) and their 
predictors for patients in a delirium clinical trial and in clinical vignettes.
METHODS: This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized 
clinical trial examining the sedative effect of chlorpromazine and/or 
haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. At the baseline, caregivers and 
nurses were independently asked to select the PSG for the trial patient from 5 
choices corresponding to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of 0 or 
higher (no sedation), -1 to -2, -3, -4, and -5 (deep sedation). Respondents also 
selected a PSG for 6 vignettes that differed by the level of agitation, ability 
to communicate, and survival.
RESULTS: Forty-two caregivers and 39 nurses answered questions regarding PSGs. 
For the trial patient, caregivers preferred RASS scores of -1 to -2 most often 
(36%), whereas nurses preferred an RASS score of -3 most often (51 %). 
Caregivers were significantly more likely than nurses to choose lighter sedation 
(odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P = .01) despite reporting greater delirium-related 
distress (P = .0006). Patients were undersedated 33% to 53% of the time and 
oversedated 0% to 15% of the time according to the PSG response criteria. In the 
case vignettes, deeper sedation was preferred by nurses (P < .0001) and for 
patients who were unable to communicate (OR, 3.1-4.4; P < .0001) and had a 
shorter life expectancy (OR, 1.7; P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many 
patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' PSGs, and this 
highlights room for improvement.
LAY SUMMARY: In the last days of life, many patients with cancer develop 
delirium and become restless/agitated; this can be highly distressing. 
Caregivers and physicians alike are often concerned about the use of sedatives 
for agitated delirium and try to find a balance between maximizing comfort and 
maintaining communication. This study examined the concept of a personalized 
sedation goal for setting an individualized target for the level of sedation. 
Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were 
undersedated in comparison with caregivers' stated goals, and this highlights 
room for improvement.

Mortality outcomes for Māori requiring renal replacement therapy during critical 
illness: a single unit audit in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Zealand.

BACKGROUND: Māori in New Zealand (NZ) are disproportionately affected by chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and experience lower life expectancy on community dialysis 
compared with non-Māori. We previously identified a higher renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) requirement for Māori in our intensive care unit (ICU), the 
tertiary referral centre for NZ's Te Manawa Taki region.
AIM: To describe mortality outcomes by ethnicity in the population requiring RRT 
in our ICU.
METHODS: Retrospective audit of the Australia and NZ Intensive Care Society 
database for adult admissions to our general ICU from Te Manawa Taki between 
2014 and 2018. Patients were stratified by non-RRT requirement (non-RRT), 
RRT-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-RRT) and RRT-requiring end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD).
RESULTS: Relative to the population of Te Manawa Taki, Māori were 
over-represented across all strata, especially ESRD (61.8%), followed by AKI-RRT 
(35.0%) and non-RRT (32.4%) (P < 0.001). There was no excess mortality by 
ethnicity in any stratum. Crude in-ICU mortality was similar by ethnicity among 
AKI-RRT (30.8% among Māori, vs 31.5%; P = 1.000) and ESRD (16.4% among Māori, vs 
20.6%; P = 0.826). This trend remained at 1 year. Adjusted for clinically 
selected variables, neither AKI-RRT nor ESRD mortality was predicted by Māori 
ethnicity, both in-ICU and at 1 year. Irrespective of ethnicity, AKI-RRT 
patients had highest in-ICU mortality (31.2%; P < 0.001), while ESRD had highest 
1-year mortality (46.1%; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Increased RRT requirement among Māori in our ICU is due to higher 
representation among ESRD. We did not demonstrate excess mortality by ethnicity 
in any stratum. AKI-RRT had higher in-ICU mortality than ESRD, but this reversed 
at 1 year.

Medicine(Qingdao Hiser Hospital), Qingdao, China.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
ratio of surgical treatment options for small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHC) by 
using the decision tree model and providing a reference for the clinical 
therapeutic decisions for SHC.
METHODS: The data of 719 cases with SHC in the BCLC 0-A who were treated in the 
past were collected. The survival duration and treatment cost of patients in 
each experimental group after hepatic resection (HR), radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA), and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: For SHC with a diameter of less than 3.0 cm, HR, RFA, and OLT had 
similar cost-effectiveness ratios. OLT could achieve a longer life expectancy, 
but it was greatly affected by the dropout rate while waiting for the liver 
donor. RFA was preferred when the willingness to pay (WTP) < 2,5000 RMB/QALY, 
OLT was preferred when WTP > 75,000 RMB/QALY, and HR was preferred when WTP was 
between the two.
EXPERT OPINION: HR in SHC with OLT had the longest life expectancy, but due to 
the limitations of organ sources, OLT was the preferred treatment option when 
the WTP was large enough.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of liver cancer may increase life expectancy. 
Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) play a vital role 
in diagnosing liver cancer. Together, both modalities offer significant 
individual and specific diagnosis data to physicians; however, they lack the 
integration of both types of information. To address this concern, a 
registration process has to be utilized for the purpose, as multimodal details 
are crucial in providing the physician with complete information.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to present a model of CT-MRI registration used to 
diagnose liver cancer, specifically for improving the quality of the liver 
images and provide all the required information for earlier detection of the 
tumors. This method should concurrently address the issues of imaging procedures 
for liver cancer to fasten the detection of the tumor from both modalities.
METHODS: In this work, a registration scheme for fusing the CT and MRI liver 
images is studied. A feature point-based method with normalized 
cross-correlation has been utilized to aid in the diagnosis of liver cancer and 
provide multimodal information to physicians. Data on ten patients from an 
online database were obtained. For each dataset, three planar views from both 
modalities were interpolated and registered using feature point-based methods. 
The registration of algorithms was carried out by MATLAB (vR2019b, Mathworks, 
Natick, USA) on an Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20 GHz computer. The 
accuracy of the registered image is being validated qualitatively and 
quantitatively.
RESULTS: The results show that an accurate registration is obtained with minimal 
distance errors by which CT and MRI were accurately registered based on the 
validation of the experts. The RMSE ranges from 0.02 to 1.01 for translation, 
which is equivalent in magnitude to approximately 0 to 5 pixels for CT and 
registered image resolution.
CONCLUSION: The CT-MRI registration scheme can provide complementary information 
on liver cancer to physicians, thus improving the diagnosis and treatment 
planning process.

BACKGROUND: Older multimorbid adults have a high risk of mortality and a short 
life expectancy (LE). Providing high-value care and avoiding care overuse, 
including of preventive care, is a serious challenge among multimorbid patients. 
While guidelines recommend to tailor preventive care according to the estimated 
LE, there is no tool to estimate LE in this specific population. Our objective 
is therefore to develop an LE estimator for older multimorbid adults by 
transforming a mortality prognostic index, which will be developed and 
internally validated in a prospective cohort.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will analyse data of the Optimising Therapy to Prevent 
Avoidable Hospital Admissions in Multimorbid Older People cohort study in Bern, 
Switzerland. 822 participants were included at hospitalisation with age of 70 
years or older, multimorbidity (three or more chronic medical conditions) and 
polypharmacy (use of five drugs or more for >30 days). All-cause mortality will 
be assessed during 3 years of follow-up. We will apply a flexible parametric 
survival model with backward stepwise selection to identify the mortality risk 
predictors. The model will be internally validated using bootstrapping 
techniques. We will derive a point-based risk score from the regression 
coefficients. We will transform the 3-year mortality prognostic index into an LE 
estimator using the Gompertz survival function. We will perform a qualitative 
assessment of the clinical usability of the LE estimator and its application. We 
will conduct the development and validation of the mortality prognostic index 
following the Prognosis Research Strategy (PROGRESS) framework and report it 
following the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for 
Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Written informed consent by patients themselves or, in 
the case of cognitive impairment, by a legal representative, was required before 
enrolment. The local ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern) has 
approved the study. We plan to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals and 
present them at national and international conferences.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of rare genetic disorders of collagen 
characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and tissue 
fragility. The authors describe a rare case of a 52-year-old woman that 
presented to the clinic with chronic joint pain and talipes equinovarum since 
childhood. Large eyes, sunken cheeks, thin nose and lobeless ears were noticed 
on clinical examination. Beighton joint hypermotility criteria were met with a 
positive Walker and Steinberg sign, elbow extension superior to 10° and knee 
extension in genu recurvatum more than 10°. An aortic diastolic grade III/VI 
heart murmur was heard. The complementary study was unremarkable. Moderate 
aortic insufficiency was found on transthoracic echocardiogram. Genetic testing 
confirmed positivity for COL1A2, a gene that encodes pro-alpha2 chain type of 
collagen, which causes cardiac-valvular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Authors intend 
to warn to collagen-related syndromes, since severe complications are associated 
with a reduced life expectancy for individuals with this condition.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect objective and especially 
subjective data on changes in cervical spine mobility after single-level 
anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and to investigate the impact 
on quality of life and activities of daily living (ADLs).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although there are several studies dealing with the 
objective change in mobility after single-level ACDF, there are few data on how 
spondylodesis of a motion segment affects subjective restriction of cervical 
spine mobility.
METHODS: Patients undergoing first-time, single-level ACDF for a symptomatic 
spondylotic process were eligible. Data were collected before surgery, at 
3-month, and 1-year follow-up. Patients were assessed via clinical scores (pain 
intensity, Short-Form 8 [SF-8], among others) and asked for impairment in ADLs 
due to restriction of cervical spine mobility. The subjective restriction was 
acquired by a five-step patient-reported score. The range of motion was measured 
by the CROM device.
RESULTS: Data of 97 patients could be evaluated. For pain scores and SF-8 there 
were significant improvements 3 months and 1 year after surgery (P < 0.001). The 
impairment for most ADLs improved 3 months after surgery and further after 1 
year. The subjective restriction showed a significant improvement in general and 
for all single directions 1 year after surgery. In the objective measurements, a 
significantly higher total rotation could be found 1 year after surgery compared 
to preoperatively (101.6° ± 21.2 vs. 93.9° ± 23.4; P = 0.002). There were no 
significant differences in total flexion-extension and lateral flexion. 
Increasing age was a significant predictor for objective and subjective 
restriction.
CONCLUSION: The concern of many patients of being severely restricted in their 
cervical spine mobility after single-level ACDF can be denied. Objectively, the 
rotation even showed a significant improvement. Regarding the subjective 
restriction, which is more important for the patients, we found a significant 
improvement in general and for all directions of movement after surgery.Level of 
Evidence: 3.
