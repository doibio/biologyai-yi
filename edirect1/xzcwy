sources de données administratives sur la santé en Colombie-Britannique. Une 
cohorte représentative de la population a ensuite été utilisée pour produire les 
taux d’incidence et de mortalité, ce qui a permis ensuite d’établir des 
projections des taux d’incidence et de mortalité. L’indice de l’état de santé 
Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (IES3) a également été inclus dans le modèle pour 
tenir compte de divers états de la santé fonctionnelle, ce qui a permis de 
réaliser des projections sur la qualité de vie liée à la santé. Enfin, nous 
avons estimé les paramètres de prestation des soins et les coûts des soins de 
santé à partir d’enquêtes nationales canadiennes et de données administratives 
sur la santé, puis nous les avons inclus dans les paramètres du modèle pour 
évaluer les répercussions épidémiologiques et économiques de la paralysie 
cérébrale.
RÉSULTATS: S’il est vrai que le taux brut global d’incidence de la paralysie 
cérébrale devrait demeurer stable, les nouveaux cas diagnostiqués de paralysie 
cérébrale connaîtront une hausse, passant d’environ 1 800 cas en 2011 à près de 
2 200 cas en 2031. De plus, le nombre de personnes atteintes de ce trouble 
devrait passer de plus de 75 000 en 2011 à plus de 94 000 en 2031. Les coûts 
directs des soins de santé en dollars canadiens constants de 2010 
s’établissaient à environ 11 700 $ pour les enfants de 1 à 4 ans atteints de 
paralysie cérébrale, comparativement à environ 600 $ pour ceux n’étant pas 
atteints de cette maladie. En outre, les personnes atteintes de paralysie 
cérébrale ont tendance à avoir une moins bonne qualité de vie liée à la santé 
pendant de plus longues périodes.
CONCLUSION: Les personnes atteintes de paralysie cérébrale continueront à être 
confrontées à des difficultés parce qu’elles nécessitent des soins médicaux 
spécialisés de façon continue et ont un besoin croissant de services de soutien. 
Notre étude fournit un aperçu significatif des coûts à venir et des 
répercussions de la paralysie cérébrale et offre des données précieuses qui 
pourraient servir à élaborer des programmes et des stratégies de santé ciblés 
pour les Canadiens atteints de cette maladie.

Plain Language Summary: A cerebral palsy diagnosis is accompanied by a 
substantial economic and social burden. The number of newly diagnosed cases of 
cerebral palsy will rise from approximately 1800 in 2011 to nearly 2200 in 2031. 
The number of people living with cerebral palsy is expected to increase from 
more than 75 000 in 2011 to more than 94 000 in 2031. Canadians with cerebral 
palsy will continue to experience reduced quality of life, increased 
disabilities and a rising need for supportive services including informal care.

Aspirin is one of the most commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Various potential pharmacological effects of aspirin, such as anticancer, 
antibacterial activity, and prolonging life expectancy have been discovered. 
However, the mechanism of aspirin is not fully elucidated. Herein, the effects 
of aspirin on fatty acid metabolism in yeast cell model Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
were studied. The results showed that aspirin can induce lipid accumulation and 
reduce the unsaturated fat index in cells. The assessment of cell membrane 
integrity demonstrated that aspirin caused damage to the cell membrane. These 
effects of aspirin were attributed to the alterations of the expression of DCI1 
and OLE1. Similarly, aspirin was able to cause lipid accumulation and damage to 
the cell membrane by interfering with the expression of OLE1 in Candida 
albicans. These findings are expected to improve current understanding of the 
mode of action of aspirin and provide a novel strategy for antifungal drug 
design. Graphical abstract [Figure: see text].

OBJECTIVE: Declining healthy life expectancy due to functional disability is 
relevant and urgent because of its association with decreased quality of life 
and also for its enormous socioeconomic impact. The aim of this study is to 
examine the impact of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and physical activity 
habits on functional disability among community-dwelling Japanese adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a population-based retrospective cohort 
study including 9673 people aged 39-98 years in Japan (4420, men). Functional 
disability was defined as a condition meeting Japan's new long-term care 
insurance certification requirements for the need of assistance in the 
activities of daily living whether by caregivers or assistive devices. Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model identified variables related to functional 
disability.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3.7 years. During the study period, 165 
disabilities occurred in the overall study population. Multivariate analysis 
showed that diabetes (HR 1.74 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.68)) and no physical activity 
habit (HR 1.83 (1.27 to 2.65)) presented increased risks for disability. HR for 
disability increased with the number of risk factors (HR of individuals with 
four conditions, 3.96 (1.59 to 9.99) vs individuals with none of those 
conditions as a reference). HR for disability among patients with diabetes with 
and without a physical activity habit was 1.68 (0.70 to 4.04) and 3.19 (1.79 to 
5.70), respectively, compared with individuals without diabetes with a physical 
activity habit.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of diabetes and lack of habitual physical activity 
is predictive of functional disability in Japanese. Habitual physical activity 
attenuates the risk of functional disability in patients with diabetes.

INTRODUCTION: Aging and chronic HIV infection are clinical conditions that share 
the states of inflammation and hypercoagulability. The life expectancy of the 
world population has increased in the last decades, bringing as complications 
the occurrence of diseases that undergoing metabolic, bone, cardiological, 
vascular and neurological alterations. HIV-infected patients experience these 
changes early and are living longer due to the success of antiretroviral 
therapy. The objectives of this study was to evaluate some changes in the plasma 
hemostatic profile of 115 HIV-reactive elderly individuals over 60 years old in 
the chronic phase of infection, and compare with 88 healthy uninfected elderly 
individuals. Plasma determinations of D-dimers, Fibrinogen, von Willebrand 
Factor, Antithrombin, Prothrombin Time, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, 
and platelet count were performed. In the HIV-reactive group, these variables 
were analyzed according to viral load, protease inhibitor use and CD4+ T 
lymphocyte values. After adjusted values for age and sex, the results showed 
higher levels of Antithrombin (103%; 88%, p = 0.0001) and Prothrombin Time 
activities (92.4%; 88.2%, p = 0.019) in the HIV group compared to the control 
group. We observed higher values of Fibrinogen in protease inhibitor users in 
both the male (p = 0.043) and female (p = 0.004) groups, and in the female HIV 
group with detected viral load (p = 0.015). The male HIV group with a CD4+ 
count> 400 cells / mm3 presented higher von Willebrand Factor values (p = 
0.036). D-Dimers had higher values in the older age groups (p = 0.003; p = 
0.042, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the elderly with chronic HIV infection with 
few comorbidities had a better hemostatic profile than negative control group, 
reflecting the success of treatment. Protease inhibitor use and age punctually 
altered this profile.

There is a growing need to understand how species respond to habitat changes and 
the potential key role played by natal dispersal in population dynamics, 
structure and gene flow. However, few studies have explored differences in this 
process between conspecifics living in natural habitats and those inhabiting 
landscapes highly transformed by humans, such as cities. Here, we investigate 
how individual traits and social characteristics can influence the natal 
dispersal decisions of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) living in urban and 
rural areas, as well as the consequences in terms of reproductive success and 
apparent survival. We found short dispersal movements among individuals, with 
differences between urban and rural birds (i.e., the former covering shorter 
distances than the latter), maybe because of the higher conspecific density of 
urban compared to rural areas. Moreover, we found that urban and rural females 
as well as bold individuals (i.e., individuals with shorter flight initiation 
distance) exhibited longer dispersal distances than their counterparts. These 
dispersal decisions have effects on individual fitness. Individuals traveling 
longer distances increased their reproductive prospects (productivity during the 
first breeding attempt, and long term productivity). However, the apparent 
survival of females decreased when they dispersed farther from their natal 
territory. Although further research is needed to properly understand the 
ecological and evolutionary consequences of dispersal patterns in transformed 
habitats, our results provide information about the drivers and the consequences 
of the restricted natal movements of this species, which may explain its 
population structuring through restricted gene flow between and within urban and 
rural areas.

Cost effectiveness of rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil for neuromyelitis 
optica spectrum disorder in Thailand: Economic evaluation and budget impact 
analysis.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory condition of 
the central nervous system. The extent of disability depends on the severity of 
the disease and the number of relapses. Although azathioprine is currently the 
main treatment for patients with NMOSD in Thailand, patients often relapse 
during its use. Hence, it is argued that there are other drugs that would be 
more effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, from a societal 
perspective and from the economic impact on Thailand's healthcare system, the 
cost utility of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and rituximab in 
patients resistant to azathioprine. The Markov model with a one-year cycle 
length was applied to predict the health and cost outcomes in patients with 
NMOSD over a lifetime. The results showed that rituximab exhibited the highest 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains among all the options. Among the 
rituximab-based treatments, the administration of a rituximab biosimilar with 
CD27+ memory B cell monitoring proved to be the most cost-effective option. At 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Thai baht (THB), or 5,289 US dollar 
(USD), per QALY gained, the treatment exhibited the highest probability of being 
cost effective (48%). A sensitivity analysis based on the adjusted price of a 
generic MMF determined that the treatment was cost effective, exhibiting an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -164,653 THB (-5,443 USD) and a 32% 
probability of being cost effective. The calculated budget impact of treating 
patients resistant to conventional therapy was 1-6 million THB (33,000-198,000 
USD) for the first three years, while after the third year, the budget impact 
stabilized at 3-4 million THB (99,000-132,000 USD). These data indicate that, in 
Thailand, treatment of drug resistant NMOSD with a rituximab biosimilar with 
CD27+ memory B cell monitoring or treatment with a generic MMF would be cost 
effective and would result in a low budget impact. Therefore, the inclusion of 
both the rituximab biosimilar and a generic MMF in the National Drug List of 
Essential Medicine for the treatment of NMOSD may be appropriate.

BACKGROUND: Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) are the most effective 
treatment for OUD, but uptake of these life-saving medications has been 
extremely limited in US prisons and jail settings, and limited data are 
available to guide policy decisions. The objective of this study was to estimate 
the impact of screening and treatment with medications for OUD in US prisons and 
jails on post-release opioid-related mortality.
METHODS: We used data from the National Center for Vital Statistics, the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics, and relevant literature to construct Monte Carlo 
simulations of a counterfactual scenario in which wide scale uptake of screening 
and treatment with medications for OUD occurred in US prisons and jails in 2016.
RESULTS: Our model predicted that 1840 (95% Simulation Interval [SI]: -2757 - 
4959) lives would have been saved nationally if all persons who were clinically 
indicated had received medications for OUD while incarcerated. The model also 
predicted that approximately 4400 (95% SI: 2675 - 5557) lives would have been 
saved nationally if all persons who were clinically indicated had received 
medications for OUD while incarcerated and were retained in treatment 
post-release. These estimates correspond to 668 (95% SI: -1008 - 1812) and 1609 
(95% SI: 972 - 2037) lives saved per 10,000 persons incarcerated, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Prison and jail-based programs that comprehensively screen and 
provide treatment with medications for OUD have the potential to produce 
substantial reductions in opioid-related overdose deaths in a high-risk 
population; however, retention on treatment post-release is a key driver of 
population level impact.

BACKGROUND: China is experiencing one of the worst air quality problems in the 
world. China implemented the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan 
(APPCAP) and the air quality has recently achieved remarkable improvement.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations of variations in annual fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) levels and changes in life expectancy in Chinese urban 
populations from 2013 to 2017.
METHOD: We collected annual-average concentrations of PM2.5 and average life 
expectancy of urban residents in 214 cities from 2013 to 2017. We conducted a 
longitudinal panel analysis applying linear mixed-effect models to evaluate the 
association between PM2.5 reduction and life expectancy increase with and 
without adjustment for socioeconomic and medical-care confounders.
RESULT: The nationwide-average annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 
67.78 μg/m3 in 2013 to 45.25 μg/m3 in 2017; meanwhile, the average life 
expectancy of urban residents increased from 78.53 to 79.86 years. A decrease of 
10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with an increment of 0.18 (95% confidence 
interval: 0.06, 0.30) year in life expectancy. After simultaneously adjusting 
for GDP per capita, smoking prevalence, urbanization rate and maternal 
mortality, the association turned to be insignificant at the national level, but 
remained significant in the eastern region with life expectancy gained 0.16 (95% 
CI: 0.04, 0.27) year per 10 μg/m3 reduction of PM2.5.
CONCLUSION: Lower PM2.5 air pollution might be associated with extended life 
expectancy in east of China. The implementation of APPCAP during 2013 to 2017 
might have resulted in benefits on life expectancy, especially in east of China.

The identification of factors that alter postural stability is fundamental in 
the design of interventions to maintain independence and mobility. This is 
especially important for women because of their longer life expectancy and 
higher incidence of falls compared to men. The objective of this study was to 
construct the percentile box charts and determine the values of reference for 
the accelerometric assessment of the static balance in women. For this, an 
observational and cross-sectional study with a sample composed of 496 women 
(68.8 ± 10.4 years old) was conducted. The measurement of accelerations used a 
triaxial accelerometer during three tests: two tests on the ground in monopodal 
support and a test on a mat with monopodal support for 30 s each. In all of the 
variables, an increase in the magnitude of the accelerations was detected as the 
age advanced. The box charts of the percentiles of the tests show the amplitude 
of the interquartile ranges, which increased as the age advanced. The values 
obtained can be used to assess changes in static balance due to aging, trauma 
and orthopaedic and neurodegenerative alterations that may alter postural 
stability and increase the risk of falling.

OBJECTIVE: To formulate a decision analysis model based on recently published 
data that addresses the dilemma, whether improvement in quality of life 
rationalises continued proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use despite the risk of 
gastric cancer (GC) in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).
DESIGN: A Markov model consisting of an initial decision regarding treatment 
with PPI (denoting it by PPI strategy) or any other treatment without PPI 
(denoting it by placebo strategy) was designed.
DATA SOURCES: Data from prospective cross-sectional studies indicating risk 
stratification for GC after the use of PPI, combined with a Markov model that 
comprised the following states: Live, GC stages 1-4, Death.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outputs included quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and life expectancy (LE). The improvement in utility in FD without PPI 
as compared with PPI use was tested (PPI vs placebo strategies). Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model and address 
uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters.
SETTING: We considered only patients whose symptoms were relieved with PPIs and 
thus, had a better quality of life compared with patients who did not receive 
PPIs.
RESULTS: The base case model showed that PPIs compared with placebo decreased LE 
by 58.4 days with a gain of 2.1 QALY. If utility (quality of life of patients 
with FD using PPI compared with patients with FD without PPI) improved by more 
than 0.8%, PPI use is considered better than placebo. Older patients benefited 
less from PPI treatment than did younger patients.
CONCLUSION: To bridge the gap between evidence and decision making, we found 
that even a small improvement in the QALY justified continuing PPI treatment.

OBJECTIVES: As HIV-positive individuals' life expectancy extends, there is an 
urgent need to manage other chronic conditions during HIV care. We assessed the 
care-seeking experiences and costs of adults receiving treatment for both HIV 
and hypertension in Malawi.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 
HIV-positive adults with hypertension at a health facility in Lilongwe that 
offers free HIV care and free hypertension screening, with antihypertensives 
available for purchase (n=199). Questions included locations and costs of all 
medication refills and preferences for these refill locations. Respondents were 
classified as using 'integrated care' if they refilled HIV and antihypertensive 
medications simultaneously. Data were collected between June and December 2017.
RESULTS: Only half of respondents reported using the integrated care offered at 
the study site. Among individuals using different locations for antihypertensive 
medication refills, the most frequent locations were drug stores and public 
sector health facilities which were commonly selected due to greater convenience 
and lower medication costs. Although the number of antihypertensive medications 
was equivalent between the integrated and non-integrated care groups, the annual 
total cost of care differed substantially (approximately US$21 in integrated 
care vs US$90 for non-integrated care)-mainly attributable to differences in 
other visit costs for non-integrated care (transportation, lost wages, 
childcare). One-third of those in the non-integrated care group reported no 
expenditure for antihypertensive medication, and six people in each group 
reported no annual hypertension care-seeking costs at all.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals using integrated care saw efficiencies because, 
although they were more likely to pay for antihypertensive medications, they did 
not incur additional costs. These results suggest that preferences and 
experiences must be better understood to design effective policies and 
programmes for integrated care among adults on antiretroviral therapy.

BACKGROUND: The acute abdomen is a life-threatening condition that demands 
urgent intervention. The required diagnostics should address the core problem 
and has to be chosen based upon the diagnostic strength of each diagnostic tool. 
Modalities with limited discriminating information regarding differential 
diagnosis have to be avoided. Expectancy and thoughts of the radiologist often 
differ from the view of the clinician in the emergency department.
OBJECTIVE: The decision about which diagnostic tools are valuable or unnecessary 
in the emergency setting is made from a surgeon's point of view. Close 
communication with radiologists is mandatory. We demonstrate the importance of 
clinical signs and symptoms and their correlation with helpful radiologic 
diagnostics.
CONCLUSION: The emergency radiologic diagnostic workup of acute abdomen has to 
be targeted and the radiologist must answer the questions in order to clarify 
whether an operation is indicated and to help define the surgical strategy. In 
emergency surgery as in acute abdomen extended diagnostics to reach a decision 
is a dangerous waste of time and must be avoided at all costs. Therefore close 
communication with the radiologist is crucial.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic literature review (SLR) had two objectives: to 
analyse published economic evaluations of biological disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) previously treated with DMARDs and to assess the quality of those 
that included sequences of treatments.
METHODS: We performed an SLR on PubMed, Central, Cochrane, and French databases 
from January 2000 to December 2018. The search focused on 
cost-effectiveness/utility/benefit analyses. We extracted data on treatment 
sequences, outcomes (e.g. quality-adjusted life year) and choices of economic 
evaluation methods (e.g. model type, type of analysis, and method of utility 
estimation). We analysed the improvement of methods by comparing two sub-periods 
(2000-2009 and 2010-2018). The quality of reporting and the quality of the 
methods were assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and a set of eight key aspects for a reference case 
for economic evaluation of bDMARDs based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology 
(OMERACT) and Drummond checklists. Data extraction and study assessment were 
performed independently by two health economists.
RESULTS: From the 824 records identified in the initial search, 51 publications 
were selected. Of these, 31 included sequences. Individual models such as 
discrete-event simulations were used in over two-fifths (22/51, 43%) of the 
selected studies. Few studies (7/51, 14%) used utility scores based on generic 
instruments (e.g. EQ-5D). Estimation of hospitalization costs was described in 
only approximately one-third of studies (19/51). Loss of quality of life (QoL) 
related to adverse events such as tuberculosis and pneumonia was included in 
one-tenth (5/51, 10%) of the studies. It was difficult to compare the results of 
the economic evaluations (i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) due to the 
high heterogeneity of studies in terms of disease stage, data sources, inputs, 
and methods of health outcome assessment used. For identified studies including 
sequences, the CHEERS assessment of reporting quality showed insufficient 
reporting of uncertainty analyses and utility weights in more than a third of 
the studies (11/31, 35%; 9/25, 36%). An in-depth assessment of the quality of 
the studies revealed that only seven, mostly conducted during the sub-period 
2010-2018, addressed the majority of methodological quality assessment issues 
such as the simulation of patient sequence pathways, the use of systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses of comparative effectiveness, the choice of treatment 
sequence, and rules for switching.
CONCLUSION: Our SLR identified a lack of high-quality evaluations assessing 
bDMARD sequences, although some improvements were made in the reporting and 
modelling of patients' pathways in studies published after 2010. In order to 
improve economic evaluations of RA, clear health technology assessment guidance 
on RA health-related QoL instruments must be provided, and data including 
long-term disease progression must be made available.

OBJECTIVES: Continuation of aspirin for secondary prevention in persons with 
limited life expectancy (LLE) is controversial. We sought to determine the 
incidence and predictors of aspirin discontinuation in veterans with LLE and/or 
advanced dementia (LLE/AD) who were taking aspirin for secondary prevention at 
nursing home admission, stratified by whether their limited prognosis (LP) was 
explicitly documented at admission.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using linked Veterans Affairs (VA) and 
Medicare clinical/administrative data and Minimum Data Set resident assessments.
SETTING: All VA nursing homes (referred to as community living centers [CLCs]) 
in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Older (≥65 y) CLC residents with LLE/AD, admitted for 7 days or 
longer in fiscal years 2009 to 2015, who had a history of coronary artery 
disease and/or stroke/transient ischemic attack, and used aspirin within the 
first week of CLC admission (n = 13 844).
MEASUREMENTS: The primary dependent variable was aspirin discontinuation within 
the first 90 days after CLC admission, defined as 14 consecutive days of no 
aspirin receipt. Independent variables included an indicator for explicit 
documentation of LP, sociodemographics, environment of care characteristics, 
cardiovascular risk factors, bleeding risk factors, individual markers of poor 
prognosis (eg, cancer, weight loss), and facility characteristics. Fine and Gray 
subdistribution hazard models with death as a competing risk were used to assess 
predictors of discontinuation.
RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of aspirin discontinuation was 27% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 26%-28%) in the full sample, 34% (95% CI = 33%-36%) in residents 
with explicit documentation of LP, and 24% (95% CI = 23%-25%) in residents with 
no such documentation. The associations of independent variables with aspirin 
discontinuation differed in residents with vs without explicit LP documentation 
at admission.
CONCLUSION: Just over one-quarter of patients discontinued aspirin, possibly 
reflecting the unclear role of aspirin in end of life among prescribers. Future 
research should compare outcomes of aspirin deprescribing in this population. J

Generic entry of newer anticoagulants is expected to decrease the costs of 
atrial fibrillation management. However, when making switches between brand and 
generic medications, bioequivalence concerns are possible. The objectives of 
this study were to predict and compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of brand 
dabigatran with hypothetical future generics. Markov microsimulations were 
modified to predict the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years of 
patients on either brand or generic dabigatran from a US private payer 
perspective. Event rates for generics were predicted using previously developed 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. The analyses showed that generic 
dabigatran with lower-than-brand systemic exposure were dominant. Meanwhile, 
generic dabigatran with extremely high systemic exposure was not cost-effective 
compared with the brand reference. Cost-effectiveness of generic medications 
cannot always be assumed as shown in this example. Combined use of 
pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic models can assist in decision making between 
brand and generic pharmacotherapies.

Physical fitness is one of the key factors in healthy aging. Although physical 
fitness is widely recognized to decline with age, age-related decreases in the 
individual dimensions of physical fitness in later life are less clear. Purpose: 
The purpose of the present study was to describe the age-related changes in six 
fitness components covering a variety of motor dimensions in men and women 
through a 12-year longitudinal epidemiological study. Method: Participants were 
randomly selected community-living men (n = 1,139) and women (n = 1,128) aged 40 
to 79 years at baseline who were repeatedly tested over a mean (standard 
deviation) follow-up period of 9.8 (3.4) years with a mean of 4.9 (2.3) 
examinations. The six physical fitness tests were sit-and-reach, grip strength, 
sit-ups, one-leg standing, reaction time and leg extension power. The effect of 
age on each physical fitness task was analyzed using a mixed-effects model 
controlling for habitual physical activity level. Results: The fixed effect of 
the interaction of age and time in all fitness tests was significant in men. 
Higher age at baseline was significantly associated with a greater decrease over 
time except in one-leg standing. In women, no significant interaction effect of 
age and time was found in grip strength or reaction time. Age-related changes in 
grip strength and reaction time were constant with increasing age. Conclusion: 
Twelve-year longitudinal data showed that the age-related decrease in physical 
fitness over time, especially musculoskeletal fitness in men, was pronounced, 
whereas in women, the decrease was less pronounced.

The pressure on glaucoma services is ever-growing, and policymakers seek robust 
cost-effectiveness arguments in their decisions around resource allocation. The 
benefits of glaucoma are in preventing or delaying a future loss of vision and 
associated quality of life, and this expectation is quantified using a metric 
called utility which can be compared against other disease states. In recent 
clinical trials lasting up to 3 years, it has been difficult to show a 
difference in utility between glaucoma treatments in this limited period of 
time. When it comes to cost, the direct medical costs are only part of the broad 
range of costs that glaucoma brings to patients and communities, and the 
estimation of these costs can be difficult and imprecise. While the 
cost-effectiveness of glaucoma care, in general, is not in dispute, especially 
over longer time frames, the inability to measure changes in utility in shorter 
time frames impedes the uptake of innovations around the world. A number of 
approaches to improve the sensitivity and specificity of utility measurements 
are under investigation.

BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a female-specific risk factor for the development of 
future cardiovascular disease. Whether early preventive cardiovascular disease 
risk screenings combined with risk-based lifestyle interventions in women with 
previous preeclampsia are beneficial and cost-effective is unknown.
METHODS: A micro-simulation model was developed to assess the life-long impact 
of preventive cardiovascular screening strategies initiated after women 
experienced preeclampsia during pregnancy. Screening was started at the age of 
30 or 40 years and repeated every five years. Data (initial and follow-up) from 
women with a history of preeclampsia was used to calculate 10-year 
cardiovascular disease risk estimates according to Framingham Risk Score. An 
absolute risk threshold of 2% was evaluated for treatment selection, i.e. 
lifestyle interventions (e.g. increasing physical activity). Screening benefits 
were assessed in terms of costs and quality-adjusted-life-years, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios compared with no screening.
RESULTS: Expected health outcomes for no screening are 27.35 
quality-adjusted-life-years and increase to 27.43 quality-adjusted-life-years 
(screening at 30 years with 2% threshold). The expected costs for no screening 
are €9426 and around €13,881 for screening at 30 years (for a 2% threshold). 
Preventive screening at 40 years with a 2% threshold has the most favourable 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, i.e. €34,996/quality-adjusted-life-year, 
compared with other screening scenarios and no screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Early cardiovascular disease risk screening followed by risk-based 
lifestyle interventions may lead to small long-term health benefits in women 
with a history of preeclampsia. However, the cost-effectiveness of a lifelong 
cardiovascular prevention programme starting early after preeclampsia with 
risk-based lifestyle advice alone is relatively unfavourable. A combination of 
risk-based lifestyle advice plus medical therapy may be more beneficial.

OBJECTIVES: This study provides an overview of the influence of occupational 
risk factors on the global burden of disease as estimated by the occupational 
component of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study.
METHODS: The GBD 2016 study estimated the burden in terms of deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) arising from the effects of occupational 
risk factors (carcinogens; asthmagens; particulate matter, gases and fumes 
(PMGF); secondhand smoke (SHS); noise; ergonomic risk factors for low back pain; 
risk factors for injury). A population attributable fraction (PAF) approach was 
used for most risk factors.
RESULTS: In 2016, globally, an estimated 1.53 (95% uncertainty interval 
1.39-1.68) million deaths and 76.1 (66.3-86.3) million DALYs were attributable 
to the included occupational risk factors, accounting for 2.8% of deaths and 
3.2% of DALYs from all causes. Most deaths were attributable to PMGF, 
carcinogens (particularly asbestos), injury risk factors and SHS. Most DALYs 
were attributable to injury risk factors and ergonomic exposures. Men and 
persons 55 years or older were most affected. PAFs ranged from 26.8% for low 
back pain from ergonomic risk factors and 19.6% for hearing loss from noise to 
3.4% for carcinogens. DALYs per capita were highest in Oceania, Southeast Asia 
and Central sub-Saharan Africa. On a per capita basis, between 1990 and 2016 
there was an overall decrease of about 31% in deaths and 25% in DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposures continue to cause an important health burden 
worldwide, justifying the need for ongoing prevention and control initiatives.
