areas of developing countries, but a successful adoption of well-equipped green 
roofs is still lacking and is limited to open farms. To fulfill the gaps in 
urban agriculture in determining diversity status and socioeconomic factors 
affecting the adoption of RTG, this study was conducted. The survey was 
conducted from February 3 to April 6, 2021, where a total of 116 respondents 
were selected randomly from Morang and Sunsari districts. The rooftop adopters 
had 30.5% and 33.2% of the roofs under farming in Morang and Sunsari, 
respectively, having the size of the roof of rooftop adopters significantly 
larger than nonadopters. A binary logit model was used to determine the factor 
affecting the adoption of RTG where age, gender, schooling year, training, and 
farming experience have a significant effect on the adoption of RTG. Locally 
available material was given preference under farming and nutritionally 
important 50 species were reported with tests of the daily food requirement of 
the respondents. The diversity indices suggest that ornamental plant diversity 
is more followed by vegetables. Though, adopters are continuing the garden but 
have reported that lack of proper policy and ineffective management makes it 
difficult to protect the life of roof. Concludingly, respondents and other 
willing people must be provided with training, financial support, and proper 
extension services as lack of training and extension services are the major 
problems reported in the study area. Proper policy of rooftop garden is lacking 
in study area though it is under study in Kathmandu; thus, policy makers and 
research institution should focus on promoting the rooftop in study area and 
provide more reliable package for roof protection and garden continuation.

Stress-strength reliability estimation involving paired observation with ties 
using bivariate exponentiated half-logistic model.

This paper deals with the problem of maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation 
of stress-strength reliability involving paired observation with ties using 
bivariate exponentiated half-logistic distribution. This problem is of 
importance because in some real applications the strength of the component is 
highly dependent on the stress experienced by it. A bivariate extension of 
exponentiated half-logistic is discussed and an expression for the 
stress-strength reliability is obtained. This model is also useful to analyse 
data having the unusual feature of having a number of pairs with tied scores, 
even when the scores are continuous. The maximum likelihood estimate and 
interval estimate of the stress-strength reliability has been developed. The 
Bayes estimates of the stress-strength reliability under squared error loss 
function are obtained using importance sampling technique. Simulation studies 
are conducted to evaluate the performance of maximum likelihood and Bayes 
estimates. Two real-life data sets are analysed to numerically illustrate the 
usefulness of the developed method.

Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder 
that is characterized by decreased brainstem and cerebellum volume. 
Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6) is a mitochondrial disease associated 
with autosomal recessive inheritance that results from mutations in the RARS2 
gene. In this case report, we describe a new clinical presentation with a novel 
RARS2 pathogenic variant. We report here on 2 siblings who presented with 
neonatal lactic acidosis, microcephaly, growth retardation, persistent seizures, 
and cholestasis with a previously undefined RARS2 pathogenic variant. In our 
literature review, we evaluated the clinical features and pathogenic variants of 
34 patients reported in 16 publications since the initial identification of 
RARS2 pathogenic variants in PCH6 in 2007. Both siblings were detected with 
c.1564G>A (p.Val522Ile), a novel homozygous pathogenic variant of the RARS2 
gene. Imaging revealed advanced cerebral atrophy and cerebellar hypoplasia, 
while the basal ganglia and pons were preserved. At follow-up, the elevations in 
liver function test results and cholestasis had regressed while the LDH and GGT 
elevations persisted. Both siblings showed microcephaly on follow-up and started 
to suffer seizures. Severe developmental delay and nutritional problems were 
observed, and both died in infancy. RARS2 pathogenic variant is a mitochondrial 
disease that causes severe mental, motor, and developmental retardation, as well 
as short life expectancy. Our patients are the first cases with liver 
involvement in PCH6 and a novel homozygous RARS2 pathogenic variant to be 
reported in the literature. This additional phenotype can be considered as 
making a valid contribution to the literature.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy and the number of ultra-octogenarians increased 
significantly, thus making crucial the appropriateness of several endoscopic 
procedures in elderly patients. The aim of our study was to provide a 
retrospective analysis of the efficacy and safety of capsule endoscopy (CE) in 
patients aged over 80 years.
METHODS: In this single-centre study, 900 patients underwent capsule endoscopy 
between 2002 and 2015 for different indications; of these 106 patients aged ≥80 
years (group A) and 99 patients aged 40-60 years (control group B) were 
retrospectively selected.
RESULTS: Occult gastrointestinal bleeding accounted for 62.1% of all indications 
for capsule endoscopy in group B, compared to 95.2% in group A (P<0.001). 
Although not statistically significant, the diagnostic yield was higher in group 
A (71%) vs. group B (62%). The percentages of reaching the cecum and the median 
gastric transit time were uniform within the two groups. In contrast, small 
bowel transit time was longer in group A vs. B. Small bowel preparation was 
similar in the two groups. The exam was generally well tolerated in both groups, 
with capsule aspiration being one of the main adverse events, which occurred in 
two elderly patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand previous findings confirming that capsule endoscopy 
can be performed safely even in very old patients and show that the diagnostic 
yield is similar to that of younger patients.

Education and Consultation Needs of Social Workers in Practice with Rural Older 
Adults.

Ilardo J, Zell AM, Haque R, Ensberg M.

The aging population and shortage of primary care physicians lead to increasing 
gaps in access to rural geriatric healthcare. Of concern is the lack of access 
to geriatric expertise, leading to adverse effects on rural older adults' health 
outcomes and quality of life. The Geriatric Rural Extension of Expertise through 
Telegeriatric Services (also known as GREETS) project surveyed rural physical 
and behavioral healthcare practitioners to identify gaps in geriatric 
competencies in the rural workforce. Using the Qualtrics platform, a survey was 
distributed to professional membership lists throughout the State of Michigan. A 
total of 106 responses were completed, of which 50 were from respondents who 
identified their profession as a social worker. As would be expected based on 
social workers' scope of practice and the settings in which they provide 
services, social worker respondents noted a higher need than the other 
practitioner respondents for education related to (a) managing chronic pain, (b) 
managing care of patients with multiple chronic conditions, (c) having serious 
illness conversations, (d) diagnosing dementia, and (e) discussing advance care 
planning. Having identified these needs provides a basis for identifying and 
implementing training and resources for social work and other disciplines 
involved in geriatric care and services.

BACKGROUND: The provision of different types of mortality metrics (e.g., 
mortality rate ratios [MRRs] and life expectancy) allows the research community 
to access a more informative set of health metrics. The aim of this study was to 
provide a panel of mortality metrics associated with a comprehensive range of 
disorders and to design a web page to visualize all results.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a population-based cohort of all 7,378,598 persons 
living in Denmark at some point between 2000 and 2018, we identified individuals 
diagnosed at hospitals with 1,803 specific categories of disorders through the 
International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) in the National 
Patient Register. Information on date and cause of death was obtained from the 
Registry of Causes of Death. For each of the disorders, a panel of 
epidemiological and mortality metrics was estimated, including incidence rates, 
age-of-onset distributions, MRRs, and differences in life expectancy (estimated 
as life years lost [LYLs]). Additionally, we examined models that adjusted for 
measures of air pollution to explore potential associations with MRRs. We focus 
on 39 general medical conditions to simplify the presentation of results, which 
cover 10 broad categories: circulatory, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, 
urogenital, musculoskeletal, hematologic, mental, and neurologic conditions and 
cancer. A total of 3,676,694 males and 3,701,904 females were followed up for 
101.7 million person-years. During the 19-year follow-up period, 1,034,273 
persons (14.0%) died. For 37 of the 39 selected medical conditions, mortality 
rates were larger and life expectancy shorter compared to the Danish general 
population. For these 37 disorders, MRRs ranged from 1.09 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.09 to 1.10) for vision problems to 7.85 (7.77 to 7.93) for 
chronic liver disease, while LYLs ranged from 0.31 (0.14 to 0.47) years 
(approximately 16 weeks) for allergy to 17.05 (16.95 to 17.15) years for chronic 
liver disease. Adjustment for air pollution had very little impact on the 
estimates; however, a limitation of the study is the possibility that the 
association between the different disorders and mortality could be explained by 
other underlying factors associated with both the disorder and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show estimates of incidence, age of onset, age of 
death, and mortality metrics (both MRRs and LYLs) for a comprehensive range of 
disorders. The interactive data visualization site (https://nbepi.com/atlas) 
allows more fine-grained analysis of the link between a range of disorders and 
key mortality estimates.

Evolutionary medicine has been a fast-growing field of biological research in 
the past decade. One of the strengths of evolutionary medicine is to use 
non-traditional model organisms which often exhibit unusual characteristics 
shaped by natural selection. Studying these unusual traits could provide 
valuable insight to understand biomedical questions, since natural selection 
likely discovers solutions to those complex biological problems. Because of many 
unusual traits, the naked mole-rat (NMR) has attracted attention from different 
research areas such as aging, cancer, and hypoxia- and hypercapnia-related 
disorders. However, such uniqueness of NMR physiology may sometimes make the 
translational study to human research difficult. Damaraland mole-rat (DMR) 
shares multiple characteristics in common with NMR, but shows higher degree of 
similarity with human in some aspects of their physiology. Research on DMR could 
therefore offer alternative insights and might bridge the gap between 
experimental findings from NMR to human biomedical research. In this review, we 
discuss studies of DMR as an extension of the current set of model organisms to 
help better understand different aspects of human biology and disease. We hope 
to encourage researchers to consider studying DMR together with NMR. By studying 
these two similar but evolutionarily distinct species, we can harvest the power 
of convergent evolution and avoid the potential biased conclusions based on 
life-history of a single species.

INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic advances have markedly increased life expectancy for 
those with cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting in a median predicted survival over 
50 years. Consequently, people with CF (pwCF) are living through their 
reproductive years and the rate of pregnancy is rapidly rising. Despite the 
increased relevance of this topic, multicentre studies investigating the 
association between maternal health and choices made during pregnancy on 
maternal and fetal outcomes do not exist. Furthermore, there are very limited 
data on the outcomes following CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
modulator use during pregnancy and lactation.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in the Era of Modulators 
(MAYFLOWERS) is a prospective, multicentre observational clinical trial which 
will enrol approximately 285 pregnant pwCF including those who are modulator 
ineligible and those who choose to continue or discontinue CFTR modulator 
therapy during pregnancy and lactation. The primary aim of this 35-month study 
is to assess whether lung function changes during pregnancy differ based on the 
continued use of modulators or other factors such as pre-existing comorbid 
conditions. Secondary objectives include evaluation of pregnancy related and 
obstetrical complications and changes in mental health.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The design of this study required special 
consideration of study burden on pregnant and lactating people with chronic 
illness in the setting of a substantial number of unanswered questions under 
these conditions. MAYFLOWERS is the first prospective clinical trial examining 
pregnancy in CF; the outcomes will guide providers on pregnancy management in 
pwCF and others with chronic respiratory disease.

INTRODUCTION: Utility instruments are used to assess patients' health-related 
quality of life for cost-utility analysis (CUA). However, for cancer patients, 
the dimensions of generic utility instruments may not capture all the 
information relevant to the impact of cancer. Cancer-specific utilities provide 
a useful alternative. Under the auspices of the Multi-Attribute Utility in 
Cancer Consortium, a cancer-specific utility algorithm was derived from the 
FACT-G. The new FACT-8D contains eight dimensions: pain, fatigue, nausea, sleep, 
work, support from family/friends, sadness, and worry health will get worse. The 
aim of the study was to obtain a Canadian value set for the FACT-8D.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was administered to a Canadian general 
population online panel, quota sampled by age, sex, and province/territory of 
residence. Respondents provided responses to 16 choice sets. Each choice set 
consisted of two health states described by the FACT-8D dimensions plus an 
attribute representing survival duration. Sample weights were applied and the 
responses were analyzed using conditional logistic regression, parameterized to 
fit the quality-adjusted life year framework. The results were converted into 
utility weights by evaluating the marginal rate of substitution between each 
level of each FACT-8D dimension with respect to duration.
RESULTS: 2228 individuals were recruited. The analysis dataset included n = 1582 
individuals, who completed at least one choice set; of which, n = 1501 completed 
all choice sets. After constraining to ensure monotonicity in the utility 
function, the largest decrements were for the highest levels of pain (- 0.38), 
nausea (- 0.30), and problems doing work (- 0.23). The decrements of the 
remaining dimensions ranged from - 0.08 to - 0.18 for their highest levels. The 
utility of the worst possible health state was defined as - 0.65, considerably 
worse than dead.
CONCLUSIONS: The largest impacts on utility included three generic dimensions 
(i.e., pain, support, and work) and nausea, a symptom caused by cancer (e.g., 
brain tumours, gastrointestinal tumours, malignant bowel obstruction) and by 
common treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, opioid analgesics). This 
may make the FACT-8D more informative for CUA evaluating in many cancer 
contexts, an assertion that must now be tested empirically in head-to-head 
comparisons with generic utility measures.

Metabolic state can alter olfactory sensitivity, but it is unknown whether the 
activity of the olfactory bulb (OB) may fine tune metabolic homeostasis. Our 
objective was to use CRISPR gene editing in male and female mice to enhance the 
excitability of mitral/tufted projection neurons (M/TCs) of the OB to test for 
improved metabolic health. Ex vivo slice recordings of MCs in CRISPR mice 
confirmed increased excitability due the targeted loss of Kv1.3 channels, which 
resulted in a less negative resting membrane potential (RMP), enhanced action 
potential (AP) firing, and insensitivity to the selective channel blocker 
margatoxin (MgTx). CRISPR mice exhibited enhanced odor discrimination using a 
habituation/dishabituation paradigm. CRISPR mice were challenged for 25 weeks 
with a moderately high-fat (MHF) diet, and compared with littermate controls, 
male mice were resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Female mice did not 
exhibit DIO. CRISPR male mice gained less body weight, accumulated less white 
adipose tissue, cleared a glucose challenge more quickly, and had less serum 
leptin and liver triglycerides. CRISPR male mice consumed equivalent calories as 
control littermates, and had unaltered energy expenditure (EE) and locomotor 
activity, but used more fats for metabolic substrate over that of carbohydrates. 
Counter to CRISPR-engineered mice, by using chemogenetics to decrease M/TC 
excitability in male mice, activation of inhibitory designer receptors 
exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) caused a decrease in odor 
discrimination, and resulted in a metabolic profile that was obesogenic, mice 
had reduced EE and oxygen consumption (VO2). We conclude that the activity of 
M/TC projection neurons canonically carries olfactory information and 
simultaneously can regulate whole-body metabolism.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The 
olfactory system drives food choice, and olfactory sensitivity is strongly 
correlated to hunger and fullness. Olfactory function thereby influences 
nutritional balance and obesity outcomes. Obesity has become a health and 
financial crisis in America, shortening life expectancy and increasing the 
severity of associated illnesses. It is expected that 51% of Americans will be 
obese by the year 2030. Using CRISPR gene editing and chemogenetic approaches, 
we discovered that changing the excitability of output neurons in the olfactory 
bulb (OB) affects metabolism and body weight stabilization in mice. Our results 
suggest that long-term therapeutic targeting of OB activity to higher processing 
centers may be a future clinical treatment of obesity or type II Diabetes.

BACKGROUND: While a great deal of research has brought attention to the issue of 
physician burnout in recent years, and resident physician burnout in particular, 
the topics of physician well-being, and by extension physician thriving, have 
been relatively understudied. Consequently, we propose a model of resident 
physician thriving. Objective To understand what factors contribute to a 
subjective sense of thriving among resident physicians.
DESIGN: In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews from May 2020 through 
February 2021 with resident physicians to determine what factors have 
contributed to their sense of thriving in their careers as well as in their 
lives more generally. We used a snowball sampling technique to recruit 
participants. Validated instruments were used to quantify the participant's 
subjective level of job and life satisfaction as well as their level of career 
burnout. To derive our conclusions, we employed thematic content analysis using 
a grounded theory-based approach.
PARTICIPANTS: Resident physicians in the internal medicine, pediatrics, and 
combined internal medicine-pediatrics residency programs at a single 
university-affiliated institution.
APPROACH: We interviewed those residents with high life, career, and residency 
satisfaction who did not meet criteria for burnout to explore those factors that 
contribute to their sense of thriving.
KEY RESULTS: Thirty-seven screening interviews were conducted. Twenty-four 
participants met criteria for life, career, and residency satisfaction while 
also not meeting criteria for burnout. The six key themes contributing to 
resident thriving that we identified during the course of our analysis included 
program leadership, learning climate, connectedness, joy in medicine, life 
balance, and intrinsic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This project proposes a model of resident thriving that can 
potentially inform program structure, culture, and values.

Autophagy-related gene (Atg) proteins are key players in autophagy. Some 
proteins that function in vesicle trafficking and lipid metabolism are also 
involved in autophagy. The SPO14 in yeast, which encodes phospholipase D (PLD), 
is involved in membrane trafficking and plays a vital role in sporulation during 
meiosis. Crosstalk has been identified between autophagy and sporulation. 
Although the PLD is required for macroautophagy in mammals, its role in yeast 
macroautophagy remains unclear. We observed that Spo14 is not required for 
macroautophagy in yeast and that it is dispensable for Atg8 lipidation, which 
plays an important role in phagophore extension. Our results also revealed that 
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Atg8 degradation is not completely blocked in 
atg1Δ/atg1Δ cells under sporulation condition. Therefore, Spo14 is not required 
for macroautophagy in yeast.

The recent increase in life expectancy has resulted in an increase in the number 
of older adults with diabetes mellitus. In addition to type 2 diabetes, in which 
aging is a well-known risk factor, individuals with type 1 and other types of 
diabetes are also increasing owing to longevity in the general population and 
improved prognosis of the disease and comorbidities. Insulin-dependent state in 
type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes, such as diabetes after 
pancreatectomy, inevitably requires insulin treatment for survival; however, 
daily injection of insulin is often hampered in older adults due to impaired 
cognitive function or limited activities of daily living. In this review, we 
aimed to discuss the current situation of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 
older adults and highlight future prospects. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 
549-553.

Elements and Determinants of Professional Identity During the Pandemic: A 
Hermeneutic Qualitative Study.

Superiore Osteopatia, Milan, Italy.

Phenomenon: The construct of professionalism in undergraduate medical education 
is a core outcome that is included in the wider concept of professional identity 
formation. The former is grounded in the more general concept of identity, 
intended as an internalized set of role expectations. Some have proposed 
frameworks based on psychological or sociological approaches, but empirical 
research is still scarce and often limited to the exploration of the role of 
specific learning activities. The pandemic imposed adaptations that produced an 
artificial setting for a social experiment, suitable to observe how the 
deprivation of the social component of a student's life, such as in presence 
teaching and practical training, unveiled the elements and determinants of the 
developing identity of medical students. Approach: This research was the 
extension of a previous phenomenological study about medical students' lived 
experience of distance learning during the lockdown phase in Italy. We adopted a 
hermeneutic approach to furtherly deepen the analysis of the phenomenon at 
stake, in dialogue with the relevant literature. Eight 6th year medical students 
underwent an in-depth interview, themes were inductively generated and used to 
identify elements and determinants of the developing identities. Findings: Four 
themes developed, synthetized in the overarching theme "From crawling to 
standing on your feet and walking toward an uncertain future". The themes were: 
"social places and practices that make me feel like a student and a medical 
student", "toward self-regulation", "an emotional journey", "threats to the 
identity". The elements of the perceived identity as a medical student were 
autonomy and learning self-regulation, professional knowledge, competence, and 
sense of belonging to a community. The determinant factors which influenced the 
identity as a medical student were living environment, learning spaces and 
architectures, the social networks, the attendance of the healthcare facilities, 
the relationship with teachers, the social acknowledgement as a medical student, 
and as a doctor. Insights: It was possible to identify the generation of both 
constitutive elements of identity and determinants influencing identity 
development and this distinction is an added value of the research. According 
Gilles Deleuze's concept of "empty square" (the sudden lack of an object one 
used to have at hand: sociality in this case), this research highlighted the 
ambivalent nature of identity. Individualization and socialization are the 
"uneven sides" of that same paradoxical object which is identity.

Regulation of the Proliferation of Diabetic Vascular Endothelial Cells by 
Degrading Endothelial Cell Functional Genes with QKI-7.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes has emerged as one of the most serious and common chronic 
diseases of our times, causing life-threatening, disabling and costly 
complications, and reducing life expectancy. Studies have shown that 
cardiovascular morbidity is 1-3 times higher in diabetic patients than in normal 
people. There are many clinical and experimental data that prove that most of 
the complications of diabetes are related to atherosclerosis, which suggests 
that chronic hyperglycemia may induce an imbalance in the proliferation of 
vascular endothelial cells.
PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the relationship between QKI-7 and vascular 
endothelial cell dysfunction and lay a foundation for further clarifying the 
molecular mechanism of endothelial cell damage in the process of diabetes with 
atherosclerosis.
METHODS: We chose blood samples and pluripotent stem cells and vascular 
endothelial cells of hospitalized patients with diabetes and diabetes 
atherosclerosis as research subjects. The expression levels of endothelial cell 
proliferation and genes related to endothelial cell proliferation were analyzed 
by RT-qPCR and Western blot, to study the influence of QKi-7 on the 
physiological state of endothelial cells. Through gene knockdown experiment, the 
effects of QKi-7 knockdown on functional genes and physiological functions of 
endothelial cells were analyzed. Finally, RNA immunoprecipitation was used to 
test the mutual effect among QKI-7 and the transcription level of functional 
genes, and the mRNA attenuation experiment proved that QKI-7 participated in the 
degradation process of functional genes.
RESULTS: The findings of the RT-qPCR and Western blot tests revealed that QKI-7 
was highly expressed in blood samples of diabetic patients and atherosclerosis 
as well as in endothelial cells induced by human pluripotent stem cells and 
human vascular endothelial cells after high-glucose treatment. Overexpression 
and high glucose of QKI-7 resulted in inhibiting expressed function genes CD144, 
NLGN1, and TSG6 and upregulation of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, and 
IFN-γ, leading to excessive proliferation of endothelial cells. After QKI-7 gene 
knockdown, the expression levels of CD144, NLGN1, and TSG6, inflammatory factors 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, and the cell proliferation rate all returned to normal 
levels. RNA immunoprecipitation showed that QKi-7 interacted with CD144, NLGN1, 
and TSG6 mRNAs and was involved in the transcriptional degradation of functional 
genes through their interactions.
CONCLUSION: This research initially revealed the relevant molecular mechanism of 
QKI-7 leading to the excessive proliferation of endothelial cells in diabetic 
and atherosclerotic patients. In view of the role of QKI-7 in diabetic vascular 
complications, we provided a potential target for clinical diabetes treatment 
strategies in the future.

Youth on the autism spectrum often face challenges accessing services in rural 
communities compared to those who live in higher resource areas. There is a 
particular need for services that support skills that will help youth transition 
to adulthood and future employment. 4-H is a national youth development program 
that is well-positioned to address the needs of youth on the autism spectrum; 
however, minimal empirical evidence exists about the implementation and 
effectiveness of inclusive practices in 4-H programs. The goal of this study was 
to better understand barriers to enrollment and to identify gaps in support for 
youth on the autism spectrum participating in 4-H. Twenty Extension Educators in 
Indiana participated in two focus groups. Thematic analysis of focus group 
transcripts identified barriers to enrollment including awareness of 4-H as an 
inclusive program and difficulties navigating 4-H culture. Our analysis 
identified themes related to new training content and delivery including a 
resource portfolio, communication, individualized accommodations, and working 
within the existing leadership training structure. Findings support the benefits 
of 4-H as a program that can promote life skills and personal development for 
youth on the autism spectrum but also highlight a significant need for 
additional training opportunities and resources to increase uptake and improve 
the implementation of inclusive practices.

Pulmonary vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare but life-threatening clinical 
condition, often found incidentally on imaging. In this report, we present an 
interesting case of PVT of the left inferior pulmonary vein with extension into 
the left atrium in a 78-year-old woman presenting with "jolts" in the chest. 
Initial imaging with plain chest film radiograph showed findings consistent with 
COPD and no acute intrathoracic process. A CT angiogram of the chest revealed a 
filling defect consistent with thrombus within the left inferior pulmonary vein 
extending into the left atrium. A transthoracic echocardiogram was remarkable 
for a severely enlarged right ventricular cavity with moderately reduced right 
ventricular systolic function and normal left ventricular size with preserved 
systolic function. She was not a candidate for any surgical interventions, and 
she was managed with systemic anticoagulation. Management of PVT mostly depends 
on the underlying cause as there are no well-defined treatment guidelines. The 
consensus recommends systemic anticoagulation until thrombus resolution. When 
anticoagulation is contraindicated, thrombectomy is indicated to restore blood 
flow. In patients with similar presentation and clinical history it is important 
to consider PVT, and to focus on prompt diagnosis and early initiation of 
appropriate treatment.

A Change in Work-Family/Life or a Return to Traditional Normative Patterns in 
Spain? Systematic Review.

Family policies to reduce conflict in work-life balance and promote gender 
equality advanced significantly at the legislative level in Spain in the first 
decades of the twenty-first century. These advances include the 2007 Law for 
Equality between Men and Women and the extension of paternity leave to 16 weeks 
in 2020. However, advances in care work and at the professional level have been 
limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified existing imbalances in 
family-work responsibilities in general and the ICT gender gap in particular. In 
crisis situations, women adopt the role of caregivers more easily than men, and 
women with fewer educational, economic, and job resources are more likely to 
assume this role, contributing to increasing gender inequalities at work and in 
the family. COVID-19 has exposed these imbalances, highlighting the need for new 
narratives and laws that encourage gender equality. Post-COVID-19 scenarios thus 
present an opportunity for reflection and progress on Spanish family policy. 
From this perspective, the paradigm of work-family conflict, although 
interesting, must be examined and resignified. This article proposes to 
critically resignify the paradigm of work-family conflict based on the new 
narrative generated by COVID-19. The present analysis suggests a resignification 
that should involve changing the expectations and practices around work-family 
balance, based on family diversity, job insecurity, the technological 
revolution, and new masculinities. It is proposed a prior reflection to clarify 
definition of the indicators and indexes that enable operationalization of the 
concept of work-family reconciliation. It is expected that these measures will 
help to facilitate practical application of reconciliation in areas such as 
public or/and private organizations, while also enabling international 
comparative analysis.

Mortality and Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and 
Sleep Apnea Syndrome.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is reported to be 
markedly high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, it is 
extremely important to know whether SAS affects prognosis in patients with CKD. 
Further, it is imperative to understand the prognostic impact of home continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which is one of the most common 
treatments for SAS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a clinical database to identify patients with CKD 
using diagnosis codes. We included patients with CKD aged 20 years or more, not 
on renal replacement therapy, with a known change in renal function for at least 
1 year. The propensity score was used to compare event rates for patients with 
SAS and those without SAS. In addition, the prognostic impact of CPAP therapy 
was investigated. The primary outcome is a composite of death, initiation of 
renal replacement therapy, hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic heart 
disease, and cerebrovascular disease.
RESULTS: From the database, 31,294 patients with CKD without SAS and 1,026 with 
SAS were found to be eligible. Of these, 419 (41%) patients with SAS and 10,713 
(34%) patients without SAS (P < 0.01) reached the primary outcome. After 
adjustment with the propensity score, the SAS group was found to have a 
similarly poor prognosis (P < 0.01): the hazard ratio for the primary outcome 
was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.08-1.45, P < 0.01) in the group with SAS compared with the 
group without SAS. Conversely, in patients with SAS and using CPAP, the hazard 
ratio was lower and did not differ significantly (HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.76-1.22, P 
= 0.76).
CONCLUSION: In patients with CKD and SAS, the risk of death and cardiovascular 
disease is high. In addition, patients treated with CPAP may have improved life 
expectancy.

Awake surgery for brain gliomas improves resection while minimizing morbidity. 
Although intraoperative mapping was originally used to preserve motor and 
language functions, the considerable increase of life expectancy, especially in 
low-grade glioma, resulted in the need to enhance patients' long-term quality of 
life. If the main goal of awake surgery is to resume normal familial and
