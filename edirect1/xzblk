The manipulation of distinct signaling pathways and transcription factors has 
been shown to influence life span in a cell-non-autonomous manner in 
multicellular model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. These data suggest 
that coordination of whole-organism aging involves endocrine signaling, however, 
the molecular identities of such signals have not yet been determined and their 
potential relevance in humans is unknown. Here we describe a novel metabolomic 
approach to identify molecules directly associated with extended life span in C. 
elegans that represent candidate compounds for age-related endocrine signals. To 
identify metabolic perturbations directly linked to longevity, we developed 
metabolomic software for meta-analysis that enabled intelligent comparisons of 
multiple different mutants. Simple pairwise comparisons of long-lived glp-1, 
daf-2, and isp-1 mutants to their respective controls resulted in more than 
11,000 dysregulated metabolite features of statistical significance. By using 
meta-analysis, we were able to reduce this number to six compounds most likely 
to be associated with life-span extension. Mass spectrometry-based imaging 
studies suggested that these metabolites might be localized to C. elegans 
muscle. We extended the metabolomic analysis to humans by comparing quadricep 
muscle tissue from young and old individuals and found that two of the same 
compounds associated with longevity in worms were also altered in human muscle 
with age. These findings provide candidate compounds that may serve as 
age-related endocrine signals and implicate muscle as a potential tissue 
regulating their levels in humans.

It is becoming increasingly clear that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, either independently or in concert with opportunistic infections like 
pulmonary tuberculosis, is a risk factor for the development of chronic airflow 
limitation. In the majority of patients the etiology of this obstructive 
ventilatory defect is multifactorial. Post-infectious obliterative 
bronchiolitis, post-tuberculous lung damage (including bronchiectasis), immune 
reconstitution and the direct effects of HIV viral infection may all play a 
role. With increases in life expectancy and decreases in infectious 
complications in patients taking antiretroviral medications, the importance of 
HIV-associated chronic lung disease as a cause of pulmonary disability is likely 
to increase. This is particularly relevant in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, 
where both HIV infection and tuberculosis are highly prevalent. Here, to 
illustrate the complexity of this interaction, we present the case of a 
15-year-old girl with vertically acquired HIV infection, multiple episodes of 
pulmonary infection, and severe airflow obstruction.

Future time perspective: opportunities and limitations are differentially 
associated with subjective well-being and hair cortisol concentration.

Canada.

BACKGROUND: Future time perspective has been associated with subjective 
well-being, though depending on the line of research considered either an 
open-ended future time perspective or a limited future time perspective has been 
associated with high well-being. Most of this research however has 
conceptualized future time perspective as a one-dimensional construct, whereas 
recent evidence has demonstrated that there are likely at least two different 
underlying dimensions, a focus on opportunities and a focus on limitations. This 
project first seeks to replicate the two-dimensional structure of the Future 
Time Perspective Scale, and then examines the associations these dimensions may 
have with different measures of subjective well-being and a biological index of 
chronic stress.
OBJECTIVE: To test if the two dimensions of the Future Time Perspective Scale, a 
focus on opportunities and a focus on limitations, differentially associate with 
two measures of subjective well-being and a biological indicator of chronic 
stress, namely hair cortisol.
METHOD: Sixty-six community-dwelling participants with a mean age of 72 years 
(SD = 5.83) completed the Future Time Perspective Scale, Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale 
Scale. Participants also provided a 3-cm-long hair strand to index cortisol 
accumulation over the past 3 months. Following the results of a factor analysis, 
a mediation model was created for each dimension of the Future Time Perspective 
Scale, and significance testing was done through a bootstrapping approach to 
harness maximal statistical power.
RESULTS: Factor analysis results replicated the two-dimensional structure of the 
Future Time Perspective Scale. Both dimensions were then found to have unique 
associations with well-being. Specifically, a high focus on opportunities was 
associated with fewer depressive symptoms and higher morale, whereas a low focus 
on limitations was associated with reduced hair cortisol, though this 
association was mediated by subjective well-being.
CONCLUSION: RESULTS replicate and extend previous research by pointing to the 
multi-dimensional nature of the Future Time Perspective Scale. While an open 
future time perspective was overall beneficial for well-being, the exact 
association each dimension had with well-being differed depending on whether 
subjective measures of well-being or biological indices of chronic stress were 
considered.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A recent review of economic studies relating to gastric 
cancer revealed that authors use different tests to estimate utilities in 
patients with and without gastric cancer. Our aim was to determine the utilities 
of gastric premalignant conditions and adenocarcinoma with a single standardized 
health measure instrument.
METHODS: Cross-sectional nationwide study of patients undergoing upper endoscopy 
(n=1,434) using the EQ-5D-5L quality of life (QoL) questionnaire.
RESULTS: According to EQ-5D-5L, utilities in individuals without gastric lesions 
were 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.80), with gastric premalignant 
conditions 0.79 (0.77-0.81), previously treated for gastric cancer 0.77 
(0.73-0.81) and with present cancer 0.68 (0.55-0.81). Self-reported QoL 
according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) for the same groups were 0.67 
(0.66-0.69), 0.67 (0.66-0.69), 0.62 (0.59-0.65) and 0.62 (0.54-0.70) 
respectively. Utilities were consistently lower in women versus men (no lesions 
0.71 vs. 0.78; premalignant conditions 0.70 vs. 0.82; treated for cancer 0.72 
vs. 0.78 and present cancer 0.66 vs. 0.70).
CONCLUSION: The health-related QoL utilities of patients with premalignant 
conditions are similar to those without gastric diseases whereas patients with 
present cancer show decreased utilities. Moreover, women had consistently lower 
utilities than men. These results confirm that the use of a single standardized 
instrument such as the EQ-5D-5L for all stages of the gastric carcinogenesis 
cascade is feasible and that it captures differences between conditions and 
gender dissimilarities, being relevant information for authors pretending to 
conduct further cost-utility analysis.

Worldwide approximately two billion people have a diet insufficient in 
micronutrients. Even in the developed world, an increasing number of people 
consume nutrient-poor food on a regular basis. Recent surveys in Western 
countries consistently indicate inadequate intake of nutrients such as vitamins 
and minerals, compared to recommendations. The International Osteoporosis 
Foundation's (IOF) latest figures show that globally about 88% of the population 
does not have an optimal vitamin D status. The Lancet's "Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2010" demonstrates a continued growth in life expectancy for 
populations around the world; however, the last decade of life is often disabled 
by the burden of partly preventable health issues. Compelling evidence suggests 
that improving nutrition protects health, prevents disability, boosts economic 
productivity and saves lives. Investments to improve nutrition make a positive 
contribution to long-term national and global health, economic productivity and 
stability, and societal resilience.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive 
disorder resulting from the defective lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase 
(GALC). The lack of GALC enzyme leads to severe neurological symptoms. While 
most human patients are infants who do not survive beyond 2 years of age, older 
patients are also diagnosed. In addition to human patients, several naturally 
occurring animal models, including dog, mouse, and monkey, have also been 
identified. The mouse model of Krabbe disease, twitcher (twi) mouse has been 
used for many treatment trials including gene therapy. Using the combination of 
intracerebroventricular, intracerebellar, and intravenous (iv) injection of the 
adeno-associated virus serotype rh10 (AAVrh10) expressing mouse GALC in neonate 
twi mice we previously have demonstrated a significantly extended normal life 
and exhibition of normal behavior in treated mice. In spite of the prolonged 
healthy life of these treated mice and improved myelination, it is unlikely that 
using multiple injection sites for viral administration will be approved for 
treatment of human patients. In this study, we have explored the outcome of the 
single iv injection of viral vector at post-natal day 10 (PND10). This has 
resulted in increased GALC activity in the central nervous system (CNS) and high 
GALC activity in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As we have shown 
previously, an iv injection of AAVrh10 at PND2 results in a small extension of 
life beyond the typical lifespan of the untreated twi mice (~40 days). In this 
study, we report that mice receiving a single iv injection at PND10 had no 
tremor and continued to gain weight until a few weeks before they died. On 
average, they lived 20-25 days longer than untreated mice. We anticipate that 
this strategy in combination with other therapeutic options may be beneficial 
and applicable to treatment of human patients.

Comparative efficiency research (COMER): meta-analysis of cost-effectiveness 
studies.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to create a new meta-analysis method for 
cost-effectiveness studies using comparative efficiency research (COMER).
METHODS: We built a new score named total incremental net benefit (TINB), with 
inverse variance weighting of incremental net benefits (INB). This permits 
determination of whether an alternative is cost-effective, given a specific 
threshold (TINB > 0 test). Before validation of the model, the structure of 
dependence between costs and quality-adjusted life years (QoL) was analysed 
using copula distributions. The goodness-of-fit of a Spanish prospective 
observational study (n = 498) was analysed using the Independent, Gaussian, T, 
Gumbel, Clayton, Frank and Placket copulas. Validation was carried out by 
simulating a copula distribution with log-normal distribution for costs and 
gamma distribution for disutilities. Hypothetical cohorts were created by 
varying the sample size (n: 15-500) and assuming three scenarios 
(1-cost-effective; 2-non-cost-effective; 3-dominant). The COMER result was 
compared to the theoretical result according to the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the INB, assuming a margin of error of 2,000 
and 500 monetary units, respectively.
RESULTS: The Frank copula with positive dependence (-0.4279) showed a 
goodness-of-fit sufficient to represent costs and QoL (p-values 0.524 and 
0.808). The theoretical INB was within the 95% confidence interval of the TINB, 
based on 15 individuals with a probability > 80% for scenarios 1 and 2, and > 
90% for scenario 3. The TINB > 0 test with 15 individuals showed p-values of 
0.0105 (SD: 0.0411) for scenario 1, 0.613 (SD: 0.265) for scenario 2 and < 
0.0001 for scenario 3.
CONCLUSIONS: COMER is a valid tool for combining cost-effectiveness studies and 
may be of use to health decision makers.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess demographic trends of a 
long-term care institution (LTCI) for the aged throughout 24 years and to 
discuss the results considering regulations and demographic, socioeconomic, and 
epidemiological changes in Brazil during this period.
METHODS: We assessed administrative data of 394 residents of a Brazilian LTCI 
between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2013. We calculated age at admission, 
age at death, length of stay (LOS), and median age of the residents on December 
31 for each year from 1990 to 2013. Annual mortality index and total number of 
admissions and discharges also were analyzed. We used the Jonckheere-Terpstra 
trend test and 1-way ANOVA for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: We observed a significant statistical increased trend of the mean age 
at admission, of the median age of the residents, and of the median LOS 
throughout the period. There was no increased or decreased trend of the median 
age at death.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased trend of the mean age at admission and the median age 
of the residents may reflect improvements in health, socioeconomic status, life 
expectancy, and the development of protective regulations for older adults in 
Brazil. The increased trend of the median LOS may reflect the aforementioned 
improvements, but we expect a future inversion of this trend due to the 
admission of older, sicker, and more functionally dependent elderly individuals.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate psychological stress and influence factors on the mine 
emergency rescue personnel.
METHOD: 564 mine emergency rescue personnel from a rescue group were select as 
subjects, and 60 designers from a steel design institute were as controls. 
Self-made questionnaire and general job stress questionnaire were used to 
investigate the basic information, rescue history, psychosomatic symptoms, 
depression symptoms, daily job stress and negative emotions of emergency rescue 
personnel. SPSS17.0 software was used to analysis the psychological stress on 
the mine rescue personnel and its influence factors.
RESULTS: The detection rate (41.94%) of depression symptoms in rescue team was 
higher than that of controls (24.90%). The score of daily job stress was higher 
than that of logistical support. The older age group with higher negative 
emotional and daily job stress than the younger. The highest negative emotion 
was in age group of more than 40 years old. The highest score of daily job 
stress was in ≤30 years old. The score of depression and psychosomatic symptoms 
were higher than those of the college and the above. The scores of depression in 
group of duration of rescue <10 years was higher than that of duration≥10 years. 
The score of daily job stress is the lowest in rescue for 1 to 2 times per year 
and the highest in group of simulation training once a week. The score of daily 
job stress and depressive symptoms were getting higher with the extension of 
combat duty time. Age, hours of combat duty, training times a week, education 
and life events were the main affecting fectors on mental health of mine 
rescuers.
CONCLUSIONS: Mine rescuers have more psychological stress than generic 
population. The psychological stress of the mine crew is related to age, 
education, life events, training and combat readiness duty time.

AIMS: Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases remains an important treatment 
in patients with metastatic malignancy. Previous studies have indicated a 
reluctance to adopt single-fraction treatment despite considerable evidence. 
This study aims to describe the factors determining the use of palliative 
radiotherapy in patients with bone metastases and assess whether fractionation 
patterns have changed over time with emerging evidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of radiotherapy databases at 
Liverpool/Macarthur Cancer Therapy Centre and the Royal Brisbane and Women's 
Hospital was conducted for the period 1997-2009. Patients receiving palliative 
radiotherapy for bony metastases were identified and treatment sites were 
grouped into 'spine', 'limb', 'multiple' or 'other'. Treatment courses were 
divided into single- or multiple-fraction treatments. The effects of 
socioeconomic and geographical factors on radiotherapy utilisation and 
fractionation were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 5683 patients were identified in the cohort; they received a 
total of 8211 bone treatments. The overall proportion of single-fraction 
radiotherapy was 29%, with significant variation over the study period 
(P < 0.001). Age under 70 years and spine or multiple treatment sites were all 
associated with lower usage of single-fraction radiotherapy on multivariate 
analysis. Prostate and lung primary sites were associated with higher usage of 
single-fraction treatment. The proportion of single-fraction treatment remained 
low (35%), even for patients who survived less than 22 days from their last 
treatment. Socioeconomic and geographical factors had little effect on the 
number of fractions used.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of single-fraction radiotherapy for bone metastases has 
remained low in two large Australian institutions, despite considerable evidence 
that single-fraction treatment provides equivalent pain relief to fractionated 
therapy. This trend towards fractionated treatment was largely maintained, even 
in patients with limited life expectancy. Further measures to increase the rate 
of single-fraction therapy are needed.

Atrazine (AZ), a widely used herbicide has drawn attentions for its potential 
impacts on amphibians. This study aims to investigate the toxicity of AZ in Bufo 
bufo gargarizans Cantor (B. bufo gargarizans), a species of toad commonly found 
in China and countries in East Asia. We treated tadpoles with 0.1, 1, 10 and 
100 μg/L AZ for 85 days and examined related parameters. The results showed that 
the mortality of the toads in the treatment group increased dramatically in a 
U-shaped dose-response relationship. The hindlimb extension and metamorphosis 
rate of the toads were significantly inhibited by AZ at 10 and 100 μg/L. Under 
the same condition, there were significant progressive changes in the testicular 
structures. Moreover, we found that AZ has no significant effects on growth, sex 
ratios, gonadal morphology, forelimb emergence and histology in the ovaries. Our 
results support the idea that environmental contaminants including AZ may be 
relevant to global amphibian decline.

AIMS: To understand the perceptions, needs and experiences of patients with 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive interstitial lung 
disease, with a mean life expectancy similar to some forms of cancer of 
2-4 years from diagnosis. Unlike the cancer literature, which is rich with 
studies exploring the needs of their disease group, few publications exist on 
patient needs with this severe fibrotic lung disease.
DESIGN: A Qualitative study which took place between 2007-2012.
METHODS: Seventeen patients with a multidisciplinary team confirmed diagnosis of 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, with moderate to advanced disease severity and 
six of their informal carers were interviewed. An interview topic guide was 
developed by the researchers and service user group. The interviews were 
audio-recorded, semi-structured and took place at a regional respiratory and 
lung transplant centre in North West England. Interviews were transcribed 
verbatim and data analysed using Framework Analysis.
FINDINGS: Three main themes were identified: 'Struggling to get a diagnosis'; 
'Loss of the life I previously had'; and 'Living with Idiopathic Pulmonary 
Fibrosis'. Patients reported struggling to get a diagnosis and coping with a 
life-limiting, rapidly progressive illness with no good treatment and few 
support structures.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the 
difficulties faced by people with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and their 
carers. This can be used to develop better supportive care in the United Kingdom 
and ultimately improve the quality of life of these patients.

Future Costs, Fixed Healthcare Budgets, and the Decision Rules of 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Life-saving medical technologies result in additional demand for health care due 
to increased life expectancy. However, most economic evaluations do not include 
all medical costs that may result from this additional demand in health care and 
include only future costs of related illnesses. Although there has been much 
debate regarding the question to which extent future costs should be included 
from a societal perspective, the appropriate role of future medical costs in the 
widely adopted but more narrow healthcare perspective has been neglected. Using 
a theoretical model, we demonstrate that optimal decision rules for 
cost-effectiveness analyses assuming fixed healthcare budgets dictate that 
future costs of both related and unrelated medical care should be included. 
Practical relevance of including the costs of future unrelated medical care is 
illustrated using the example of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Our 
findings suggest that guidelines should prescribe inclusion of these costs.

Smoking is the first avoidable cause of morbidity and mortality. It is estimated 
that there were around 14 million smokers in France in 2012 and that smoking 
results in 70,000 deaths per year. All types of interventions reducing with 
efficacy the incidence and prevalence of smoking are to consider in prolonging 
life expectancy. Electronic cigarettes (e.cig.) are a social phenomenon but they 
also are a system delivering pharmacologically active substances; their use 
concerns today several millions of individuals in France. By this fact, it 
became important for clinical practitioners to acquire some knowledge about e. 
cig. Most of the e.cig. contains nicotine, thus, e.cig. are now called in the 
medical literature as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS). It is highly 
plausible that ENDS, which are, as of today, consumer products and not health 
products, deliver nicotine with a good bioavailability and could, if largely 
used, help to reduce smoking prevalence. However, because of current lack of 
regulations, as of today, the risk/benefit ratio of ENDS as an aid to help 
smokers quit and their adverse effect profile cannot be established. It is of 
public health responsibility to promote evidence based knowledge about e.cig. to 
know with confidence their risk/benefit ratio.

PURPOSE: To measure the desirable health outcome, termed utility, and the 
expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained with hand composite tissue 
allotransplantation (CTA) using hand amputee patients and the general public.
METHODS: Using the standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO) techniques, 
utilities were obtained from 30 general public participants and 12 amputee 
patients. The health utility and net QALYs gained or lost with transplantation 
were computed. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for the effects 
of lifelong immunosuppression on the life expectancy of transplant recipients. 
Higher scores represent greater utility.
RESULTS: Hand amputation mean health utility as measured by the SG and TTO 
methods, respectively, was 0.72 and 0.80 for the general public and 0.69 and 
0.70 for hand amputees. In comparison, hand CTA mean health utility was 0.74 and 
0.82 for the general public and 0.83 and 0.86 for amputees. Hand CTA imparted an 
expected gain of 0.9 QALYs (SG and TTO) in the general public and 7.0 (TTO) and 
7.8 (SG) QALYs in hand amputees. A loss of at least 1.7 QALYs was demonstrated 
when decreasing the life expectancy in the sensitivity analysis in the hand 
amputee group.
CONCLUSIONS: Hand amputee patients did not show a preference toward hand CTA 
with its inherent risks. With this procedure being increasingly adopted 
worldwide, the benefits must be carefully weighed against the risks of lifelong 
immunosuppressive therapy. This study does not show clear benefit to advocate 
hand CTA.

Although recent guidelines suggest aspirin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
prophylaxis in low risk patients following total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there are no cost-effectiveness studies comparing 
aspirin and warfarin. In a Markov cohort cost-effectiveness analysis, we found 
that aspirin cost less and saved more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than 
warfarin in all age groups. Cost per QALY gained by aspirin was $24,506.20 at 
age of 55 and $47,148.10 at the age of 85 following THA and $15,117.20 and 
$24,458.10 after TKA, which were greater than warfarin. In patients undergoing 
THA/TKA without prior VTE, aspirin is more cost-effective prophylactic agent 
than warfarin. Warfarin might be a better prophylaxis in TKA patients with high 
probability of VTE and very low probability of bleeding.

OBJECTIVE: Due to migration, doctors see patients from different ethnic 
backgrounds. This causes challenges for the communication. To develop training 
programs for doctors in intercultural communication (ICC), it is important to 
know which barriers and facilitators determine the quality of ICC. This study 
aimed to provide an overview of the literature and to explore how ICC works.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed to find literature published before 
October 2012. The search terms used were cultural, communication, healthcare 
worker. A realist synthesis allowed us to use an explanatory focus to understand 
the interplay of communication.
RESULTS: In total, 145 articles met the inclusion criteria. We found ICC 
challenges due to language, cultural and social differences, and doctors' 
assumptions. The mechanisms were described as factors influencing the process of 
ICC and divided into objectives, core skills and specific skills. The results 
were synthesized in a framework for the development of training.
CONCLUSION: The quality of ICC is influenced by the context and by the 
mechanisms. These mechanisms translate into practical points for training, which 
seem to have similarities with patient-centered communication.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Training for improving ICC can be developed as an 
extension of the existing training for patient-centered communication.

Cystic pancreatic tumors: should we resect all of them?

Greca G, Petrillo G.

Technologies, University Hospital "Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele", Catania,

OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cystic tumors are relatively rare tumors and only 1% of 
them are malignant. They are often asymptomatic and detected as incidental 
findings through diagnostic imaging. Currently there are no universal guide 
lines for the correct clinical approach to pancreatic cystic lesions. 
Cross-sectional imaging demonstrates some typical morphological features that 
determine the pre-operative diagnosis of the pancreatic cystic lesions (serous 
or mucinous cystadenoma, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms). In addition, 
endoscopic ultrasonography permits the collection and analysis of the fluid 
content. The aim of this paper is to describe our case load in the management of 
pancreatic cystic neoplasms and propose some criteria for choosing between 
surgical or conservative approaches.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 12 patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms were 
retrospectively evaluated. They were studied using cross-sectional imaging 
modalities (computed tomography and magnetic resonance); endoscopic 
ultrasonography was performed in 7 patients.
RESULTS: In each patient a careful evaluation of several factors (age, 
comorbidity, imaging features, symptoms, life expectancy) conditioned our 
clinical decision. Among our 12 patients, surgical resection was performed in 7 
cases.
DISCUSSION: The treatment of pancreatic cystic lesions is still a dilemma 
because even in the presence of malignant potential, pancreatic surgery remains 
very complicated and demolitive. Many factors need to be considered in the 
management of cystic pancreatic tumors. The most important include histological 
type, location, size, age and clinical condition of the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: A correct multidisciplinary pre-operative diagnosis is mandatory. 
Surgery should only be performed in selected cases.

Life-saving implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in cardiac AL 
amyloidosis.

Patel KS(1), Hawkins PN(1), Whelan CJ(1), Gillmore JD(1).

Author information:
(1)National Amyloidosis Centre, London, UK.

Cardiac involvement is the main determinant of prognosis in systemic monoclonal 
immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden 
cardiac death are not uncommon. The electrical events that precede sudden death, 
and their potential to be treated effectively, remain undefined. There are no 
European guidelines for the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) 
in amyloidosis. ICDs in general are not usually offered to patients with a life 
expectancy of less than 1 year. We describe a patient who presented with cardiac 
AL amyloidosis who underwent prophylactic ICD implantation for the prevention of 
sudden cardiac death during treatment with chemotherapy, in whom 
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia was successfully terminated over a 
3-year period.

BACKGROUND: Spinal metastases are 20 times more common than primary spinal 
tumors and often cause metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). Clinical 
manifestations (e.g., pain and neurologic dysfunction) adversely affect 
patients' quality of life. Radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, and surgery are the 
major therapeutic strategies for MSCC. There is some evidence that combining 
surgery with adjuvant RT may be a better option.
METHODS: This meta-analysis compared the therapeutic efficacy of surgery (with 
or without adjuvant RT) with RT alone in treatment of MSCC. Comparative studies 
of surgery (with or without adjuvant RT) versus RT alone for the treatment of 
MSCC were retrieved from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. 
Primary (1-year survival) and secondary (motor function and complications) 
outcomes were compared by meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 26 studies originally identified, 20 were excluded (not original 
research, lack of relevance, no group comparison, or lack of comparable data). 
Compared with RT alone, surgery (with or without adjuvant RT) was associated 
with improvement of ambulation (odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence interval = 
1.35-2.25, P < 0.05), pain relief (odds ratio = 3.61, 95% confidence interval = 
2.75-4.74, P < 0.05), and 1-year survival (odds ratio = 1.92; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.37-2.71, P < 0.01). No differences in regaining walking ability and 
substantially longer hospital stays were observed. Surgery showed better 
therapeutic efficacy than RT alone with regard to quality of life and life 
expectancy, without additional complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of these 
interventions on quality of life and to identify the best therapeutic strategy 
for patients with MSCC.

Objective. The goal of this study was to define levels and dynamic trends of 
cancer incidence at whole and some separate sites in groups of Ukrainian 
population affected by the Chornobyl accident during a long period of 
observation. Materials and methods. Those groups were Chornobyl accident 
recovery operation workers (CRW) of 1986-1987 years of participation, evacuees 
from Prypyat town and 30-km zone and residents of the most contaminated 
territories of Ukraine. Analysis was carried out with the standard methods of 
descriptive epidemiology: calculation of crude, age-specific and age-adjusted 
incidence rates with standard errors and confidence intervals. Results, 
discussion and conclusions. This study showed that all cancer incidences 
exceeded the national level only in CRW group. Decrease of cancer incidence rate 
in the recent years might be caused by shortened average life expectancy in 
Ukrainian population, especially in males. Statistically significant increase of 
leukemia incidence in CRW group was registered as well. Besides, in all three 
main affected groups there was revealed significant excess of thyroid cancer. 
Irradiation of thyroid due to radioactive iodine fallouts might be a main cause 
of this phenomenon. Increase of thyroid cancer incidence was registered not only 
in children, but also in adolescents and adults. Appearance of excess thyroid 
cancer cases as an effect of radiation exposure tends to increase during the 
time. Significant excess was also revealed for breast cancer in female CRW 
group. Because latency period for different nosological forms of 
radiation-induced malignant tumors varies widely, profound attention in further 
studies should be drawn not only to thyroid, breast cancers and leukemia, but 
also to malignancies with longer latent period: lung, stomach, colon, ovary, 
urinary bladder, kidney cancer and multiple myeloma.
