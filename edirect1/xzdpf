Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is the most economically important virus disease of 
citrus worldwide. To develop a specific serological assay for CTV, a Tomlinson 
phage display antibody library of single chain variable fragments (scFv) was 
screened with a recombinant CTV coat protein (CTV-CP) heterologously expressed 
in Escherichia coli. The phage clones were checked by ELISA to identify clones 
with high specificity for CTV-CP. Eight clones were strongly reactive with 
CTV-CP. Nucleotide sequencing of these clones revealed that all of them 
contained the same sequence. Thus, the phage-displayed scFv antibody was termed 
scFvF10. Evaluation of scFvF10 binding to CTV-CP by plate-trapped antigen ELISA 
(PTA-ELISA) and immunoblotting, showed that it was specific and allowed 
sensitive detection of CTV-CP. Homology-based molecular modeling and docking 
analysis confirmed that the interaction between CTV-CP and scFvF10, with a 
binding energy of -738 kj mol-1, occurred mainly by 12 intermolecular hydrogen 
bonds. Moreover, triple-antibody sandwich (TAS)-ELISA using scFvF10 as second 
antibody showed high sensitivity in the detection of CTV infected samples. The 
CTV detection limit of scFvF10 by PTA-ELISA and TAS-ELISA were 0.05 and 0.01 μg 
CP/mL, respectively. Our results with different diagnostic assays demonstrated 
that scFvF10 has the potential to be used as an efficient tool for CTV-infected 
plant diagnosis.

PURPOSE: To determine the individual and combined effects of 12 weeks of 
resistance exercise (RE) and whey protein supplementation on skeletal muscle 
strength (primary outcome), mass and physical function, and hormonal and 
inflammatory biomarkers in older adults.
METHODS: Thirty-six healthy older men [(mean±SE) age: 67±1 y; BMI: 
25.5±0.4 kg/m2] were randomised to either control (CON; n=9), whey protein (PRO; 
n=9), RE+control (EX+CON; n=9), or RE+whey protein (EX+PRO; n=9) in a 
double-blinded fashion. Whole-body RE (2 sets of 8 repetitions and 1 set to 
volitional failure at 80% 1RM) was performed twice weekly. Supplements (PRO, 
25 g whey protein isolate; CON, 23.75 g maltodextrin) were consumed twice daily.
RESULTS: EX+CON and EX+PRO increased leg extension (+19±3 kg and +20±3 kg, 
respectively) and leg press 1RM (+27±3 kg and +39±2 kg, respectively) greater 
than the CON and PRO groups (P<0.001, Cohen's d=1.50-1.90). RE (EX+CON and 
EX+PRO groups pooled) also increased fat-free mass (FFM) (+0.9±0.3 kg) and 6-min 
walk test distance (+21±5 m) and decreased fat mass (-0.4±0.4 kg), and 
interleukin-6 (-1.0±0.4 pg/mL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration 
(-0.7±0.3 pg/mL) greater than non-exercise (CON and PRO groups pooled; P<0.05, 
Cohen's f=0.37-0.45). Whey protein supplementation (PRO and EX+PRO groups 
pooled) increased 4-m gait speed greater than control (CON and EX+CON groups 
pooled) (+0.08±0.03 m/s; P=0.007, f=0.51).
CONCLUSION: RE increased muscle strength, FFM and physical function, and 
decreased markers of systemic inflammation in healthy active older men. Whey 
protein supplementation alone increased gait speed. No synergistic effects were 
observed. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03299972.

We report a case of a 61-year-old woman, who had been suffering from multiple 
relapses of uterine sarcoma treated by multiple cytoreduction operations. During 
the observation period there were performed 13 surgical interventions. As a 
result of operations, together with the removal of more than 60 liters of tumor 
volume, the following were performed: extirpation of the uterus with ovaries, 
right colectomy, resection of the small intestine four times, resection of the 
sigmoid colon, resection of the duodenum, peritonectomy, cholecystectomy, 
appendectomy, 2 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and Hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy procedure. During this entire period, with interruptions for 
hospital treatment, the patient works as a teacher, quality of life remains 
satisfactory. Patient observation continues, according to the computed 
tomography control (last time 02.12.2021) there are no signs of tumor relapse. 
64 months have passed since the first clinical relapse. The overall survival 
rate is 69 months and it has already exceeded the theoretically unattainable 5 
years from the onset of the disease. Cytoreductive surgery in patients with 
chemo- and radioresistant tumors of the abdominal cavity is the only effective 
method of treatment of this group of patients in addition to symptomatic 
therapy. Repeated early optimal cytoreduction with the maximum possible removal 
of all detected tumor mass and restoration of anatomical or functional integrity 
of the affected organs can reduce the likelihood of tumor cachexia, 
intoxication, anemia, thrombosis and hemorrhage, edema and dysfunction of the 
digestive and urinary systems. This prolongs life expectancy and increases its 
quality in patients with second and more uterine sarcoma relapse.

AIMS: Endocarditis accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. Timely 
diagnosis and prompt treatment are of paramount importance for optimal patient 
outcome. However, only few studies have assessed quality of care (QoC) in 
endocarditis. We aimed to describe QoC and changes in epidemiological features 
of endocarditis from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using primary indices of mortality, incidence, years of 
life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life year, 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we calculated four 
secondary measures. Principal component analysis was performed to calculate QoC 
index (QCI), scored on a scale of 0-100 with higher values indicating better 
QoC, for different locations, age groups, and genders from 1990 to 2019. The 
all-ages incidence rate of endocarditis was estimated to increase significantly 
from 1990 to 2019, while mortality rate did not change. The age-standardized QCI 
was 73.6% globally, with higher values in high-income countries than in 
low-income countries. High-income North America (82.0%) and Asia Pacific (81.1%) 
had the highest QCI, whereas Eastern Europe (43.3%) had the lowest. Globally, 
the 30-49 and 95+ age groups had the highest (91.3%) and the lowest (71.7%) QCI, 
respectively. In most countries, particularly those with lower socio-demographic 
index, women had better QCI.
CONCLUSION: This is the first global assessment of QCI, shedding light on the 
current trends and highlighting the necessity of improving the endocarditis QoC, 
mainly by timely case detection, adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, 
utilizing targeted antibiotics and advanced treatments, in the African region 
and resolving gender inequality in selected countries.

In children with very severe cerebral palsy, an adversarial legal process for 
medical negligence, when liability is admitted, requires an estimate of life 
expectancy. Medical experts using the same cohort data and the same clinical 
facts can produce quite different life expectancies, leading to arguments in 
legal conferences and courts. The issues that commonly arise include 
between-country comparisons, projected and therapy-induced advanced life 
expectancies, and the contribution of epilepsy, scoliosis, and especially 
cognition to life expectancy. In this review, these factors are discussed from 
an arithmetic, statistical, and medical viewpoint to initiate debate on the 
issue, including whether median survival should be advocated.

Since 11 March 2020 when officially declared a global pandemic, Covid-19 (or 
SARS-COV2) has turned out to be a multifaceted disease differently affecting 
countries and individuals. What makes certain countries more vulnerable than 
others has attracted the interest of scientists from various disciplines. This 
paper intends to compare the impact of demographic parameters, population health 
conditions and policy actions on prevalence and fatality levels of Covid-19 
during the first 3 months since its declaration of global pandemic. A 
country-level exploratory analysis has been conducted in order to assess how 
demography, national health conditions and measures taken interact and condition 
the disease outcomes. Analysis relies on publicly available data on Covid-19 
reported cases, deaths and number of persons tested. Those data are combined 
with demographic parameters (sex ratio, mean age, population density and life 
expectancy), health data (cardiovascular death rate, diabetes prevalence, share 
of smokers among males and females and number of hospital beds) and information 
about relative national policies aiming the management of the pandemic (lockdown 
timing and duration). Our analysis confirms the diversity of factors and the 
complexity of their interaction in explaining the propagation and fatality of 
the disease across Europe. Our findings question some well-established attitudes 
concerning the role of demographic variables and public health conditions in the 
spread of the disease.

Macrophages Are the Key Players in Promoting Hyper-Inflammatory Response in a 
Mouse Model of TB-IRIS.

TB-IRIS is an abnormal inflammatory response in a subset of HIV-TB co-infected 
patients shortly after initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Therapy in 
these patients could have greatly improved the life expectancy as ART 
reconstitutes the function and number of CD4+ T cells and many patients see 
improvement in symptoms but paradoxically up to 54% of co-infected patients 
develop TB-IRIS. Different studies have indicated that both innate and adaptive 
immunity are involved in the pathology of IRIS but the role of macrophages in 
abnormal activation of CD4+ T cells is poorly understood. Since macrophages are 
one of the major antigen-presenting cells and are infected by M.tb at a high 
frequency, they are very much likely to be involved in the development of 
TB-IRIS. In this study, we have developed a mouse model of experimental IRIS, in 
which M.tb-infected T-cell knockout mice undergo a fatal inflammatory disease 
after CD4+ T cell reconstitution. Lung macrophages and blood monocytes from 
M.tb-infected TCRβ-/- mice showed upregulated expression of cell surface 
activation markers and also showed higher mRNA expression of 
inflammation-associated chemokines and matrix metalloproteases responsible for 
tissue damage. Furthermore, cytokine and TLR signaling feedback mechanism to 
control excessive inflammation was also found to be dysregulated in these 
macrophages under lymphopenic conditions. Previous studies have shown that 
hyperactive CD4+ T cells are responsible for disease induction and our study 
shows that somehow macrophages are in a higher activated state when infected 
with M.tb in an immune-deficient condition, which results in excessive 
activation of the adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells. Understanding of the 
mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of TB-IRIS would facilitate 
identification of prospective biomarkers for disease development in HIV-TB 
co-infected patients before starting antiretroviral therapy.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease reflects a major burden of non-communicable 
disease in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Early detection and treatment of atrial 
fibrillation (AF), as a preventive measure against stroke, is currently not in 
the scope of the World Health Organization recommendation to reduce 
cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that screening for AF would be an important approach 
to determine the true AF prevalence in the general population in African 
countries and to identify asymptomatic AF patients at risk for stroke to 
optimize prevention.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to study the health-economic 
impact of AF screening in Nigeria over a life-time horizon. The patient 
population explored in the model was a population of newly detected AF cases 
that would be diagnosed with a one-time systematic screening for AF with a 
single lead ECG device in community health centres across Nigeria.
CONCLUSIONS: The health gain per newly detected AF patient (N = 31,687) was 0.41 
QALY at a cost of $5,205 per patient with 100% NOAC use, leading to an ICER of 
$12,587 per QALY gained. The intervention was cost-effective with a 99.9% 
warfarin use with an ICER of $1,363 per QALY gained. The total cost of a single 
screening session was $7.3 million for the total screened population in Nigeria 
or $1.60 per patient screened. Screening for AF to detect AF patients in need 
for stroke prevention can be a cost-effective intervention in the Sub-Saharan 
region, depending on type of anticoagulant used and drug costs.

INTRODUCTION: Globally, a metabolic disorder like Diabetes is considered as one 
of the largest global health issues, as it accounts for the majority of the 
disease burden and happens to be one of the leading causes of mortality as well 
as reduced life expectancy across the world. As in 2019, India is home to the 
second-largest number (77 million) of Diabetic adults and the number of people 
affected has been increasing rapidly over the years. Termed as "the diabetes 
capital of the world," with every fifth diabetic in the world being an Indian, 
there is an urgent need to address many critically significant challenges posed 
by Diabetes in India, like, increasing prevalence among young people in urban 
areas, less awareness among people, high cost of disease management, limited 
healthcare facilities, suboptimal diabetes control etc. In Indian context, not 
enough attempts have been made to observe and understand the long-term pattern 
of diabetes incidence and mortality. This study aims to provide deep insights 
into the recent trends of diabetes incidence and mortality in India from 1990 to 
2019.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational study based on the most recent 
data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. We extracted numbers, 
age-specific and age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of diabetes 
(from 1990 to 2019) from the Global Health Data Exchange. The average annual 
percentage changes in incidence and mortality were analysed by joinpoint 
regression analysis; the net age, period, and cohort effects on the incidence 
and mortality were estimated by age-period-cohort analysis.
RESULTS: During the study period, age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 
of diabetes in India experienced an upsurge in numbers, the incidence rate 
increased from 199.14 to 317.02, and consequently, mortality increased from 
22.30 to 27.35 per 100,000 population. The joinpoint regression analysis showed 
that the age-standardized incidence significantly rose by 1.63 % (95 % CI: 
1.57 %, 1.69 %) in Indian males and 1.56 % in Indian females (95 % CI: 1.49 %, 
1.63 %) from 1990 to 2019. On the other hand, the age-standardized mortality 
rates rose by 0.77 % (95 % CI: 0.24 %, 1.31 %) in Indian males and 0.57 % (95 % 
CI: -0.54 %, 1.70 %) in Indian females. For age-specific rates, incidence 
increased in most age groups, with exception of age groups 5-9, 70-74, 75-79 and 
80-84 in male, and age groups 5-9, 75-79 and 80-84 in female. Mortality in male 
saw a decreasing trend till age group 20-24, whereas in female, the rate 
decreased till age group 35-39. The age effect on incidence showed no obvious 
changes with advancing age, but the mortality significantly increased with 
advancing age; period effect showed that both incidence and mortality increased 
with advancing time period; cohort effect on diabetes incidence and mortality 
decreased from earlier birth cohorts to more recent birth cohorts, while 
incidence showed no material changes from 1975 to 1979 to 2000-2004 birth 
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality of diabetes decreased in younger age groups but increased 
in older age groups; however, Incidence increased in most age groups for both 
male and female. The net age or period effect showed an unfavourable trend while 
the net cohort effect presented a favourable trend. Aging was likely to drive a 
continued increase in the mortality of diabetes. Timely population-level 
interventions aiming for health education, lifestyle modification with special 
emphasis on the promotion of physical activity and healthy diet should be 
conducted, especially for male and earlier birth cohorts at high risk of 
diabetes.

Background: As life expectancy and health expenditure consumed by older people 
increase, maintaining a better health and quality of life for older adults has 
become an important social issue. Research indicates that physical activity may 
help address this challenge. Moreover, it is believed that improved quality of 
life and health benefits from physical activity can be achieved through 
interventions in the neighborhood environments. However, existing knowledge has 
often been based on bivariate relationships between these factors, and few 
studies have formally examined the extent to which any association between 
neighborhood environments, health, and quality of life may be mediated by the 
level of physical activity. This paper aims to investigate the direct and 
indirect influence of neighborhood characteristics on the health and quality of 
life of older adults, taking into account physical activity behavior and 
socio-demographic characteristics in a more comprehensive framework. Methods: 
Data were collected using a survey among 363 older adults aged 60 years and over 
in China. A path analysis was used that derives all direct and indirect 
relationships between the variables. Results: Leisure-time physical activity 
levels played a mediating role in the relation between social capital and health 
as well as quality of life. Moreover, the study confirmed direct relationships 
between neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood aesthetics and traffic 
safety and health as well as quality of life. However, the effect of 
neighborhood characteristics on health and quality of life through 
transport-related physical activity levels was not found. Conclusions: 
Leisure-time physical activity instead of transport-related physical activity 
should be considered a priority when developing interventions aiming to promote 
healthy aging. Additionally, neighborhood characteristics are important in 
promoting healthy aging, even though they have no or less impacts on older 
adults' health and quality of life through physical activity.

RATIONALE: Health equity is a significant concern of public health, yet a 
comprehensive assessment of health equity in the United States over time is 
lacking. While one might presume that overall health will improve with rising 
living standards, no such presumption is warranted for health equity, which may 
decline even as average health improves.
OBJECTIVES: To assess trends in national and state-level health equity in 
mortality for people up to age 25, ages 25-64 and aged 65 and older.
METHODS: A health equity metric was calculated as the weighted mean life 
expectancy relative to a benchmark level, defined as the life expectancy of the 
most socially-privileged subpopulation (white, non-Latinx males with a college 
education or higher).We analyzed 114,558,346 death records from the National 
Center for Health Statistics, from January 1, 1969 to December 31, 2019 to 
estimate health equity annually at the national and state-level. Using 
ICD-9/ICD-10 classification codes, inequities in health were decomposed by major 
causes of death.
RESULTS: From 1969 to 2019, health equity in the United States improved (+0.36 
points annually [95% CI 0.31-0.41]), albeit at a slower rate over the last two 
decades (+0.08 points annually [95% CI 0.03-0.14] from 2000 to 2019, compared to 
+0.57 points annually from 1969 to 2000 [95% CI 0.50-0.65]). Health equity among 
those under 25 improved substantially (+0.82 points annually [95% CI 0.75-0.89]) 
but remained flat for adults 25-64 (-0.01 points annually [95% CI -0.03-0.003]) 
For those over 65, health equity displayed a downward trend (-0.08 points 
annually [95% CI -0.09 to -0.07]). Gains in equity from reduced unintentional 
injuries and homicides have been largely offset by rising mortality attributable 
to drug overdoses.
CONCLUSIONS: The US is failing to advance health equity, especially for adults. 
Keeping policy-makers accountable to a summary measure of health equity may help 
coordinate efforts at improving population health.

IMPORTANCE: The optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) to minimize the risk of 
dementia in older age is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the association between SBP and dementia risk 
is U-shaped and whether age and comorbidity play a role in this association.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used an individual 
participant data approach to analyze 7 prospective, observational, 
population-based cohort studies that were designed to evaluate incident dementia 
in older adults. These studies started between 1987 and 2006 in Europe and the 
US. Participants had no dementia diagnosis and had SBP and/or diastolic blood 
pressure (BP) data at baseline and incident dementia status during follow-up. 
Data analysis was conducted from November 7, 2019, to October 3, 2021.
EXPOSURES: Baseline systolic BP.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause dementia (defined using Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Third Edition Revised] or Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition] and established at 
follow-up measurements or in clinical practice), mortality, and combined 
dementia and mortality were the outcomes. Covariates included baseline 
antihypertensive medication use, sex, educational level, body mass index, 
smoking status, diabetes, stroke history, myocardial infarction history, and 
polypharmacy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, and 
nonlinear associations were explored using natural splines.
RESULTS: The study analyzed 7 cohort studies with a total of 17 286 
participants, among whom 10 393 were women (60.1%) and the mean (SD) baseline 
age was 74.5 (7.3) years. Overall, dementia risk was lower for individuals with 
higher SBP, with the lowest risk associated with an SBP of approximately 185 mm 
Hg (95% CI, 161-230 mm Hg; P = .001). Stratified by overlapping 10-year baseline 
age groups, the lowest dementia risk was observed at somewhat lower systolic BP 
levels in those older than 75 years (158 [95% CI, 152-178] mm Hg to 170 [95% CI, 
160-260] mm Hg). For mortality, there was a clear U-shaped association, with the 
lowest risk at 160 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-181 mm Hg; P < .001). This U-shape 
occurred across all age groups, with the lowest dementia risk associated with an 
SBP of 134 mm Hg (95% CI, 102-149 mm Hg; P = .03) in those aged 60 to 70 years 
and increasing to between 155 mm Hg (95% CI, 150-166 mm Hg; P < .001) and 166 mm 
Hg (95% CI, 154-260 mm Hg; P = .02) for age groups between 70 and 95 years. 
Combined dementia and mortality risk curves closely resembled those for 
mortality. Associations of diastolic BP with dementia risk were generally 
similar but were less distinct.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that dementia risk was lower 
for older individuals with higher SBP levels and that more distinctly U-shaped 
associations appeared for those older than 75 years, but these associations 
cannot be explained by SBP-associated changes in mortality risk. The findings 
may warrant future trials on tailored BP management in older age groups that 
take life expectancy and health context into consideration.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 
were mainly based on limited data of the study period or area, or did not 
include detailed risk factor analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate up-to-date temporal and regional trends and risk 
factors of mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to 
CVDs by age, sex, and disease throughout the world.
METHODS: Data for the disease burden of CVDs in 195 countries and territories 
from 1990 to 2017, including mortality, DALYs, age-standardized mortality rates, 
and age-standardized DALY rates, were estimated from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017. Risk factors attributable to deaths and DALYs for CVDs were 
also estimated using the comparative risk assessment framework.
RESULTS: The number of deaths from CVDs increased by 48.62%, from 11.94 (95% UI 
11.78-12.18) million in 1990 to 17.79 (17.53-18.04) million in 2017. However, 
the age-standardized mortality rate decreased by an average of - 1.45% (- 1.72% 
to - 1.18%) annually. After fluctuation in the expected age-standardized 
mortality rate of CVDs in most of the socio-demographic index (SDI) scale, these 
rates decrease rapidly for SDI values of 0.7 and higher. In 2017, metabolic 
risks accounted for 73.48% of deaths and 73.25% of DALYs due to CVDs, behavioral 
factors accounted for 63.23% of deaths and 66.71% of attributable DALYs.
CONCLUSION: CVDs remain a major global health burden due to the increment in 
death numbers and DALYs. Aging and the main risk factors are the main drivers of 
mortality and health loss. More attention to main risk factors should be paid 
with supportive health policies.

What have we learned about mortality patterns over the past 25 years?

van Raalte AA(1).

Author information:
(1)Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.

In this paper, I examine progress in the field of mortality over the past 25 
years. I argue that we have been most successful in taking advantage of an 
increasingly data-rich environment to improve aggregate mortality models and 
test pre-existing theories. Less progress has been made in relating our 
estimates of mortality risk at the individual level to broader mortality 
patterns at the population level while appropriately accounting for contextual 
differences and compositional change. Overall, I find that the field of 
mortality continues to be highly visible in demographic journals, including 
Population Studies. However much of what is published today in field journals 
could just as easily appear in neighbouring disciplinary journals, as 
disciplinary boundaries are shrinking.

Comment in
    Lancet Oncol. 2022 Jan;23(1):13-14.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a major health problem. CT lung screening can reduce 
lung cancer mortality through early diagnosis by at least 20%. Screening 
high-risk individuals is most effective. Retrospective analyses suggest that 
identifying individuals for screening by accurate prediction models is more 
efficient than using categorical age-smoking criteria, such as the US Preventive 
Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria. This study prospectively compared the 
effectiveness of the USPSTF2013 and PLCOm2012 model eligibility criteria.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, participants from the International 
Lung Screening Trial (ILST), aged 55-80 years, who were current or former 
smokers (ie, had ≥30 pack-years smoking history or ≤15 quit-years since last 
permanently quitting), and who met USPSTF2013 criteria or a PLCOm2012 risk 
threshold of at least 1·51% within 6 years of screening, were recruited from 
nine screening sites in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, and the UK. After 
enrolment, patients were assessed with the USPSTF2013 criteria and the PLCOm2012 
risk model with a threshold of at least 1·70% at 6 years. Data were collected 
locally and centralised. Main outcomes were the comparison of lung cancer 
detection rates and cumulative life expectancies in patients with lung cancer 
between USPSTF2013 criteria and the PLCOm2012 model. In this Article, we present 
data from an interim analysis. To estimate the incidence of lung cancers in 
individuals who were USPSTF2013-negative and had PLCOm2012 of less than 1·51% at 
6 years, ever-smokers in the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer 
Screening Trial (PLCO) who met these criteria and their lung cancer incidence 
were applied to the ILST sample size for the mean follow-up occurring in the 
ILST. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02871856. Study 
enrolment is almost complete.
FINDINGS: Between June 17, 2015, and Dec 29, 2020, 5819 participants from the 
International Lung Screening Trial (ILST) were enrolled on the basis of meeting 
USPSTF2013 criteria or the PLCOm2012 risk threshold of at least 1·51% at 6 
years. The same number of individuals was selected for the PLCOm2012 model as 
for the USPSTF2013 criteria (4540 [78%] of 5819). After a mean follow-up of 2·3 
years (SD 1·0), 135 lung cancers occurred in 4540 USPSTF2013-positive 
participants and 162 in 4540 participants included in the PLCOm2012 of at least 
1·70% at 6 years group (cancer sensitivity difference 15·8%, 95% CI 10·7-22·1%; 
absolute odds ratio 4·00, 95% CI 1·89-9·44; p<0·0001). Compared to 
USPSTF2013-positive individuals, PLCOm2012-selected participants were older 
(mean age 65·7 years [SD 5·9] vs 63·3 years [5·7]; p<0·0001), had more 
comorbidities (median 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 1 [1-2]; p<0·0001), and shorter life 
expectancy (13·9 years [95% CI 12·8-14·9] vs 14·8 [13·6-16·0] years). 
Model-based difference in cumulative life expectancies for those diagnosed with 
lung cancer were higher in those who had PLCOm2012 risk of at least 1·70% at 6 
years than individuals who were USPSTF2013-positive (2248·6 years [95% CI 
2089·6-2425·9] vs 2000·7 years [1841·2-2160·3]; difference 247·9 years, 
p=0·015).
INTERPRETATION: PLCOm2012 appears to be more efficient than the USPSTF2013 
criteria for selecting individuals to enrol into lung cancer screening 
programmes and should be used for identifying high-risk individuals who benefit 
from the inclusion in these programmes.

AIM: Free fatty acid-mediated obesity plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis 
of Type 2 Diabetes. FFA induced JNK activation acts as a central regulator in 
causing hepatic insulin resistance. Similarly, Pancreastatin, a chromogranin A 
peptide, serves as a crucial link between FFA-induced insulin resistance. 
Therefore, in the present work, we sought to test Pancreastatin inhibitor PSTi8 
to ameliorate FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance in in vitro and in vivo 
models.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To verify our objective, we exposed hepatocytes (HepG2 
cells) with palmitate (0.3 mM) or palmitate + PSTi8 (200 nM). Parallelly mice 
were fed either HFD or HFD + PSTi8 (1 mg/kg). After 21 days animals were scanned 
for increased fat mass, along with GTT, ITT and PTT experiment to check glucose, 
and insulin tolerance. Furthermore, ROS generation and hepatic glycogen content 
was measured in FFA exposed hepatocytes. Gene expression and protein expression 
studies were further conducted to delineate the action mechanism of PSTi8.
KEY FINDINGS: PSTi8 exposure decreased ROS accumulation, lipid accumulation, and 
reduced glycogen content in FFA-induced groups. It also enhances glucose uptake 
and reduces gluconeogenesis to combat the FFA effect. Furthermore, gene 
expression studies indicate that PSTi8 treatment reduces NADPH oxidase3 (NOX3) 
expression and inhibits JNK signaling, a predominant source of ROS-induced 
insulin resistance.
SIGNIFICANCE: To summarize, the protective effect of PSTi8 on FFA-induced 
insulin resistance is mediated via inhibition of JNK signaling, which leads to 
decreased ROS generation and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Hence PSTi8 could be 
a therapeutic molecule to prevent western diet-induced insulin resistance.
