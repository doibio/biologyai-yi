for comorbid disorders. Therefore, early interventions for social anxiety to 
prevent negative long-term consequences are critical. However, adolescents 
rarely seek help and often avoid face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions 
due to the perceived lack of autonomy and anonymity. Thus, online interventions 
represent a promising opportunity to reach adolescents who have social anxiety 
but do not seek help yet.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, moderators, and mediators 
of an online intervention developed to reduce social anxiety in adolescents.
METHODS: A total of 222 adolescents aged 11-17 years with subclinical social 
anxiety (N=166) or with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (N=56) are 
randomly assigned to the online intervention or a care-as-usual control group. 
The 8-week guided online intervention is based on the Cognitive Model of Social 
Phobia and evidence-based online interventions for social anxiety adapted to the 
specific needs of adolescents. The care-as-usual group will be given access to 
the online intervention after the follow-up assessment. Participants are 
assessed at baseline, at 4 and 8 weeks post intervention, and at 3-month 
follow-up assessment on the primary outcome, that is, social anxiety, on 
secondary outcomes (eg, level of functioning, fear and avoidance, general 
anxiety, depression, quality of life, self-esteem, and negative effects of the 
intervention), on potential moderators (eg, therapy motivation, therapy 
expectancy, and satisfaction with the intervention), and potential mediators 
(eg, therapeutic alliance and adherence to the intervention). Data will be 
analyzed based on an intention-to-treat approach and both groups (intervention 
and care-as-usual) will be compared at each assessment time point. Furthermore, 
potential mechanisms of change and generalization of intervention effects on 
daily life are assessed using an ecological momentary assessment procedure that 
includes items on maintaining mechanisms of social anxiety, social context, and 
affect. Participants are prompted 3 times a day during the first 8 weeks of the 
study and again for 2 weeks following the follow-up assessment.
RESULTS: Recruitment is ongoing; initial results are expected in 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed considering the potential of online 
interventions as a low-threshold prevention and treatment option for adolescents 
with social anxiety and in light of current advances in dynamic modeling of 
change processes and mechanisms in early intervention and psychotherapy in 
adolescents.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly patients (≥80 years of age) with head and neck cancer 
(HNC) can prove a management challenge due to concerns regarding their 
suitability for surgery. This study aims to describe the characteristics and 
outcomes of elderly patients undergoing HNC surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective review of elderly patients undergoing HNC surgery was 
conducted. Demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, surgical 
procedure type, postoperative complications, and disposition were reviewed. 
Overall survival (OS) in the elderly cohort was compared against younger 
patients (<80 years).
RESULTS: A total of 595 patients were included, of whom 86 were aged >80 years 
(71% male; mean age 84.8, range 80.0-98.8 years). The overall complication rate 
was 43%. When compared with younger patients (n = 509), elderly patients had 
reduced OS (risk ratio: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.2), higher 90-day mortality (8.1% vs. 
2.3%, p = .005), and lower 5-year survival (43.5% vs. 64.1%, p < .001). However, 
survival was comparable to age-specific life expectancy. There was no difference 
in OS, 90-day mortality, and 5-year survival when comparing >85 (n = 33) and 
80-85 (n = 53) age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronological age alone should not negatively influence 
decision-making in HNC surgery the elderly. With careful preoperative selection 
and optimization, surgery can be performed at acceptable risk with good outcomes 
in elderly patients.

Despite the improvements in endovascular techniques during the last decades, 
there is still an increase in the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) 
with limited practical treatment, which timeline impact of any intervention for 
critical limb ischemia (CLI) is poor. Most common treatments are not suitable 
for many patients due to their underlying diseases, including aging and 
diabetes. On the one hand, there are limitations for current therapies due to 
the contraindications of some individuals, and on the other hand, there are many 
side effects caused by common medications, for instance, anticoagulants. 
Therefore, novel treatment strategies like regenerative medicine, cell-based 
therapies, Nano-therapy, gene therapy, and targeted therapy, besides other 
traditional drugs combination therapy for PAD, are newly considered promising 
therapy. Genetic material encoding for specific proteins concludes with a 
potential future for developed treatments. Novel approaches for therapeutic 
angiogenesis directly used the angiogenetic factors originating from key 
biomolecules such as genes, proteins, or cell-based therapy to induce blood 
vessel formation in adult tissues to initiate the recovery process in the 
ischemic limb. As PAD is associated with high mortality and morbidity of 
patients causing disability, considering the limited treatment choices for these 
patients, developing new treatment strategies to prevent PAD progression and 
extending life expectancy, and preventing threatening complications is urgently 
needed. This review aims to introduce the current and the novel strategies for 
PAD treatment that lead to new challenges for relief the patient's suffered from 
the disorder.

Pathogen log10 reduction targets for onsite nonpotable water systems were 
calculated using both annual infection (LRTINF) and disability-adjusted life 
year (LRTDALY) benchmarks. The DALY is a measure of the health burden of a 
disease, accounting for both the severity and duration of illness. Results were 
evaluated to identify if treatment requirements change when accounting for the 
likelihood, duration, and severity of illness in addition to the likelihood of 
infection. The benchmarks of 10-4 infections per person per year (ppy) and 10-6 
DALYs ppy were adopted along with multilevel dose-response models for Norovirus 
and Campylobacter jejuni, which characterize the probability of illness given 
infection (Pill|inf) as dose-dependent using challenge or outbreak data. We 
found differences between treatment requirements, LRTINF - LRTDALY, for some 
pathogens, driven by the likelihood of illness, rather than the severity of 
illness. For pathogens with dose-independent Pill|inf characterizations, such as 
Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia, and Salmonella enterica, the difference, LRTINF - 
LRTDALY, was identical across reuse scenarios (<than 1.0). The differences 
varied across source waters and uses for C. jejuni and Norovirus and widened 
when the dose-dependent Pill|inf was characterized using challenge data (i.e., 
when there was evidence of a small probability of illness at low doses). 
Norovirus LRTs were highest across pathogens, despite low severity and 
dose-dependent Pill|inf, given the high infection risks predicted by the 
multilevel framework. This work highlights updated Norovirus dose-response best 
practices, the quantitative impact of risk endpoint in determining risk-based 
treatment targets, and the discrepancy in best available science for illness and 
infection responses across pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Snakebite envenoming (SBE) is a neglected tropical disease capable 
of causing both significant disability and death. The burden of SBE is 
especially high in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was 
to perform a geospatial analysis evaluating the association of sociodemographics 
and access to care indicators on moderate and severe cases of SBE in Brazil.
METHODS: We conducted an ecological, cross-sectional study of SBE in Brazil from 
2014 to 2019 using the open access National System Identification of Notifiable 
Diseases (SINAN) database. We then collected a set of indicators from the Brazil 
Census of 2010 and performed a Principal Component Analysis to create variables 
related to health, economics, occupation, education, infrastructure, and access 
to care. Next, a descriptive and exploratory spatial analysis was conducted to 
evaluate the geospatial association of moderate and severe events. These 
variables related to events were evaluated using Geographically Weighted Poisson 
Regression. T-values were plotted in choropleth maps and considered 
statistically significant when values were <-1.96 or >+1.96.
RESULTS: We found that the North region had the highest number of SBE cases by 
population (47.83/100,000), death rates (0.18/100,000), moderate and severe 
rates (22.96/100,000), and proportion of cases that took more than three hours 
to reach healthcare assistance (44.11%). The Northeast and Midwest had the next 
poorest indicators. Life expectancy, young population structure, inequality, 
electricity, occupation, and more than three hours to reach healthcare were 
positively associated with greater cases of moderate and severe events, while 
income, illiteracy, sanitation, and access to care were negatively associated. 
The remaining indicators showed a positive association in some areas of the 
country and a negative association in other areas.
CONCLUSION: Regional disparities in SBE incidence and rates of poor outcomes 
exist in Brazil, with the North region disproportionately affected. Multiple 
indicators were associated with rates of moderate and severe events, such as 
sociodemographic and health care indicators. Any approach to improving snakebite 
care must work to ensure the timeliness of antivenom administration.

INTRODUCTION: Among individuals ≥ 65 years old, aortic stenosis is highly 
prevalent and the number of cases is expected to increase in the coming decades, 
due to the increased life expectancy. Nevertheless, the actual aortic stenosis 
burden is not well known in population settings and the impact of aortic 
stenosis on quality of life has not been studied. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate aortic stenosis impact on health-related quality of life in patients > 
65 years old.
METHODS: An epidemiological case-control study was carried out to compare 
quality of life in patients ≥65 years old with severe symptomatic aortic 
stenosis. Demographical and clinical information was prospectively obtained and 
quality of life information was collected with the Short Form Health Survey_v2 
(SF-12) questionnaire. The association between quality of life and aortic 
stenosis was determined using multiple logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis self-perceived worse quality of 
life on all dimensions and summary components of the SF-12 questionnaire. In the 
final multiple logistic regression model a significant inverse association was 
observed between the dimensions 'physical role' and 'social role' (p = 0.002 and 
p = 0.005) and an association close to significance with 'physical role' (p = 
0.052) of the SF-12 questionnaire.
CONCLUSION: The use of quality of life scales allows the assessment of the 
impact of aortic stenosis on quality of life and may improve the therapeutic 
approach to severe aortic stenosis, providing evidence for patient-centered 
care.

BACKGROUND: Evaluating trunk strength is an important aspect of the physical 
examination of people with low back pain (LBP). Thus, reliable, valid, and 
easily applied measurement tools are needed to quantify trunk muscle strength 
and monitor changes in response to interventions.
OBJECTIVES: To determine within-day and between-day test re-test reliability and 
criterion validity of a handheld dynamometer (HHD) to evaluate maximum isometric 
trunk strength in people with chronic LBP and asymptomatic individuals.
DESIGN: Reliability and criterion validity study.
METHODS: Twenty adult participants with chronic, non-specific LBP and 35 
asymptomatic individuals participated. Isometric trunk flexion, extension, and 
rotation strength were evaluated with the HHD (Active force 2) and the 
within-day and between-day reliability were determined with intraclass 
correlation coefficients (ICC2,1) and the standard error of the measurements 
(SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and the limits of agreement (LOA) using 
Bland-Altman plots. Criterion validity was evaluated using Pearson correlation 
coefficients to compare HHD measurements to isokinetic dynamometry for both 
isometric trunk flexion and extension strength.
RESULTS: Good to excellent within-day and between-day reliability was observed 
for people with LBP and asymptomatic individuals with (ICC2,1) of 0.73-0.93 and 
0.62-0.92 respectively. A moderate to strong correlation was found between 
measurements with the HHD and the isokinetic dynamometer with a correlation of 
r = 0.68-0.78 and r = 0.56-0.59 for people with LBP and asymptomatic 
participants respectively.
CONCLUSION: A HHD is a reliable, valid, and clinically applicable tool for the 
measurement of trunk strength in adults with and without chronic LBP.

Selected aspects of mortality in Czechia and Slovakia in the pandemic year 2020.

[Article in English]

Burcin B, Šprocha B, Šídlo L.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to analyse the mortality trends in Czechia and Slovakia 
through detailed anonymized primary data on deaths in 2010-2020 and in 
particular to identify various aspects of the impact of the 2020 pandemic year 
in their context.
METHODS: Using the DeRaS application, complete life tables by sex for 2010-2020 
were constructed for Czechia and Slovakia, and changes in life expectancy at 
birth and at the exact age of 65 years were analysed. Using Pressat's univariate 
decomposition, the effect of different age groups on the change in life 
expectancy at birth for men and women between 2019 and 2020 was identified. 
Subsequently, age group contributions to the decline in temporary life 
expectancy between the exact ages of 65 and 110 were also determined. Trends in 
mortality rates for each of the major cause of death groups were analysed using 
directly standardized mortality rates, with a detailed focus on selected groups 
of cardiovascular disease. The contributions of the major cause of death groups 
to the decline in life expectancy at birth between 2019 and 2020 were 
empirically identified by applying bivariate decomposition according to the 
Pollard method.
RESULTS: In 2020, the life expectancy of newly born men in Czechia decreased by 
1.05 years and that of women by 0.76 years. In Slovakia, the decrease was 0.67 
years for men and 0.64 years for women. An even greater reduction was found for 
both countries at the exact age of 65. The main reason for this was the 
worsening of the mortality rates between the ages of 65 and 89 years, especially 
from COVID-19 and some diseases of the circulatory system.
CONCLUSION: The study identified a significant reduction in life expectancy at 
birth for both men and women in Czechia and Slovakia between 2019 and 2020. The 
main reason for this phenomenon was the increase in mortality rates at senior 
ages, up to around age 90. However, the increase in mortality did not affect all 
age groups, but contributions at younger ages could not significantly compensate 
for the negative impact of older ages. The study confirmed mortality from 
COVID-19 as a major factor in declining life expectancy at birth but also noted 
a non-negligible effect of the worsened mortality rates from circulatory 
diseases. The negative impact of both groups of causes of death was particularly 
pronounced at the age of 65 and over.

Homologous recombination is a fundamental process of life. It is required for 
the protection and restart of broken replication forks, the repair of chromosome 
breaks and the exchange of genetic material during meiosis. Individuals with 
mutations in key recombination genes, such as BRCA2 (also known as FANCD1), or 
the RAD51 paralogues RAD51B, RAD51C (also known as FANCO), RAD51D, XRCC2 (also 
known as FANCU) and XRCC3, are predisposed to breast, ovarian and prostate 
cancers1-10 and the cancer-prone syndrome Fanconi anaemia11-13. The BRCA2 tumour 
suppressor protein-the product of BRCA2-is well characterized, but the cellular 
functions of the RAD51 paralogues remain unclear. Genetic knockouts display 
growth defects, reduced RAD51 focus formation, spontaneous chromosome 
abnormalities, sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and replication fork defects14,15, 
but the precise molecular roles of RAD51 paralogues in fork stability, DNA 
repair and cancer avoidance remain unknown. Here we used cryo-electron 
microscopy, AlphaFold2 modelling and structural proteomics to determine the 
structure of the RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 complex (BCDX2), revealing that 
RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 mimics three RAD51 protomers aligned within a nucleoprotein 
filament, whereas RAD51B is highly dynamic. Biochemical and single-molecule 
analyses showed that BCDX2 stimulates the nucleation and extension of RAD51 
filaments-which are essential for recombinational DNA repair-in reactions that 
depend on the coupled ATPase activities of RAD51B and RAD51C. Our studies 
demonstrate that BCDX2 orchestrates RAD51 assembly on single stranded DNA for 
replication fork protection and double strand break repair, in reactions that 
are critical for tumour avoidance.

Antibiotic use in aquaculture has become very controversial vis-à-vis driving 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in aquatic bacterial populations. The AMR trends 
in fish pathogens in Hong Kong over a four-year period suggests that providing 
small stakeholder farmers with free veterinary advice on fish health issues and 
treatments, as well as subsidized quality-assured medicines, likely reduced AMR. 
We observed a dramatic reduction in the proportion of bacteria resistant to 
oxolinic acid, oxytetracycline, and florfenicol on local aquaculture farms 
between 2018 and 2021. These decreases coincided with either a change in 
antibiotic use practices on farms (i.e. with oxytetracycline), or the reduction 
in the use of specific drugs (i.e. oxolinic acid and florfenicol). We did not 
observe a similar decline in the resistance pattern to commonly used antibiotics 
in human medicine in the same fish bacteria. Resistance to these products, which 
were unlikely to be used by the farmers in our study, was very high. Our finding 
suggests that both human and veterinary use of antibiotics in Hong Kong may have 
an influence on the AMR of bacteria in the aquatic environment.

OBJECTIVE: This article systematically reviewed the methodological quality of 
modelling approaches for economic evaluations of the treatment of motor symptoms 
in Parkinson's disease in studies published after 2010.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken using PubMed, EconLit, 
the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Health Service Economic 
Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment databases of the UK 
National Health Service Centre for Review and Dissemination (March 2010 to July 
2022). Quality was assessed using a checklist from the German Scientific Working 
Group.
RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were evaluated, with the majority based on Markov 
models (n = 18). Studies assessed the cost effectiveness of medical (n = 12) or 
surgical (n = 8) treatment, and included costs from a payer or healthcare 
provider's perspective (n = 17). Furthermore, all studies included 
quality-adjusted life-years as an effect measure. In the quality assessment of 
the literature, a mean score of 42.1 points (out of 56 points) on the checklist 
of the German Scientific Working Group was achieved. Seventeen studies concluded 
the intervention under study was (likely) cost effective. No intervention was 
classified as cost ineffective.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of economic evaluation models in Parkinson's disease 
has improved in terms of calculating cost and transition parameters, as well as 
carrying out probabilistic sensitivity analyses, compared with the published 
literature of previous systematic reviews up to 2010. However, there is still 
potential for further development in terms of the integration of non-motor 
complications and treatment changes, the transparent presentation of parameter 
estimates, as well as conducting sensitivity analyses and validations to support 
the interpretation of results.

PURPOSE: Self-Reporting using traditional text-based Quality-of-Life (QoL) 
instruments can be difficult for people living with sensory impairments, 
communication challenges or changes to their cognitive capacity. Adapted 
communication techniques, such as Easy-Read techniques, or use of pictures could 
remove barriers to participation for a wide range of people. This review aimed 
to identify published studies reporting adapted communication approaches for 
measuring QoL, the methodology used in their development and validation among 
adult populations.
METHODS: A scoping review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews 
checklist was undertaken.
RESULTS: The initial search strategy identified 13,275 articles for screening, 
with 264 articles identified for full text review. Of these 243 articles were 
excluded resulting in 21 studies for inclusion. The majority focused on the 
development of an instrument (12 studies) or a combination of development with 
some aspect of validation or psychometric testing (7 studies). Nineteen 
different instruments were identified by the review, thirteen were developed 
from previously developed generic or condition-specific quality of life 
instruments, predominantly aphasia (7 studies) and disability (4 studies). Most 
modified instruments included adaptations to both the original questions, as 
well as the response categories.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies identified in this scoping review demonstrate that several 
methods have been successfully applied e.g. with people living with aphasia 
post-stroke and people living with a disability, which potentially could be 
adapted for application with more diverse populations. A cohesive and 
interdisciplinary approach to the development and validation of communication 
accessible versions of QOL instruments, is needed to support widespread 
application, thereby reducing reliance on proxy assessors and promoting 
self-assessment of QOL across multiple consumer groups and sectors.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy worldwide has led to a larger 
population of older people, which in turn entails a rising prevalence of cancer. 
One of the main complications of cancer is delirium, especially in advanced 
stages.
OBJECTIVE: To determine which delirium screening instrument is the most accurate 
in older people with cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review was designed. A literature search was performed in 
MEDLINE, EBSCO and SCOPUS; additional records were identified by handsearching. 
Selection criteria were studies involving people with cancer and a mean sample 
age of 60 years or older, assessing delirium, and reporting the metric 
properties of the assessment instrument. Studies with post-surgical patients and 
substance abuse delirium were excluded.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2021, 14 eligible studies evaluated 13 different 
assessment tools, reporting an incidence of delirium ranging from 14.3% to 
68.3%. The Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) showed the best metric 
properties, followed by the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC), Confusion 
Assessment Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Only two 
studies were considered to be at low risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 Tool. No 
study exclusively examined this population group.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening tools for delirium are heterogeneous for older people 
with cancer, and there is a need to analyze metric properties exclusively in the 
older population. Registered on PROSPERO ID: CRD42022303530.

PURPOSE: A palliative care infrastructure is lacking for Latinos with 
life-threatening illness, especially in rural regions of the United States. The 
purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a community-based palliative 
care lay health advisor (LHA) intervention for rural-dwelling Latino adults with 
cancer.
METHODS: An exploratory mixed-methods participatory action research design was 
carried out by an interprofessional research team that included community and 
academic members. Fifteen Latino community leaders completed a 10-hour 
palliative care training program and then served as palliative care LHAs. 
Although 45 Latinos with cancer initially agreed to participate, four withdrew 
or died and six were not reachable by the LHAs, for a final total of 35 patient 
participants.The trained palliative care LHAs delivered information on home 
symptom management and advance care planning to assigned participants. 
Palliative care nurses led the training and were available to the LHAs for 
consultation throughout the study. The LHAs made an average of three telephone 
calls to each participant. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-Revised 
(ESAS-r) and the four-item Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey (ACPES-4) 
were administered pre- and postintervention to determine the intervention's 
effectiveness. Encounter forms were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using case 
comparison.
RESULTS: The major finding was that significant improvements were shown for all 
four items of the ACPES-4 among both the LHAs (posttraining) and the 
participants (postintervention). Information on advance care planning was shared 
with 74.3% of the 35 participants. Participants showed clinical improvement in 
physical symptom scores and clinical deterioration in emotional symptom scores 
following the intervention, although these changes did not reach statistical 
significance. The advisors noted that participants were anxious about how to 
explain cancer to children, the uncertainty of their prognosis, and medical 
expenses. This sample was younger than those of other cancer studies; 51.4% were 
under age 50 and 73.1% had at least one child in the home.
CONCLUSIONS: A community-based palliative care LHA-nurse partnership was shown 
to be a feasible way to engage in conversations and deliver information about 
advance care planning to rural-dwelling Latino adults with cancer. The positive 
results led to the regional cancer center's decision to select "cultural care" 
as its 2022 goal for maintaining its accreditation with the Commission on 
Cancer.

Many factors take part in increasing the healthy period of life - the quality of 
the environment, drinking water, psychological attitudes in society, dietary 
patterns, comfort of living, quality of housing, economic relations in the state 
and society, the degree of landscaping and much more. Collectively, the factors 
that lead to a healthier and longer life are called the environment that 
promotes longevity. The scientific study of such an environment, changing 
everyday life in terms of its quality related to health and increasing duration, 
is the newest trend in anti-aging medicine. Individual viability (intrinsic 
capacity) is one of the 4 concepts of geriatrics. The main concept is senile 
asthenia, the second is premature aging, the third is age viability, which is a 
psychological state of aging. It seems promising to study the effect of 
nutrition on individual vitality and longevity. Objective - to study the 
influence of nutrition on the aging process, to develop further preventive 
programs based on the data obtained. Methods. Search for literature on nutrition 
and age problems was held in the databases of RSCI, PubMed, Google Scholar by 
keywords: aging, ageism, nutrition, individual viability, age-related changes, 
resilience diet, age-related viability, senile asthenia, domain approach, age. 
Results. Domain-based assessment is a modern diagnosticis of the condition of 
people of older age groups, which forms the basis for the development of 
gerontological preventive programs, in which nutrition plays an important role. 
Modern studies indicate that the transition in nutrition from «Western» patterns 
to diets with a high content of plant products, as well as fish, vegetable 
protein (nuts), reduced salt content prevents the development of complications 
of age-associated diseases by the mechanism of reducing inflammation and 
hyperinsulinemia, replenishing micronutrient deficiency. Conclusion. Many 
studies have confirmed the relationship between compliance with optimal 
nutrition and longevity, as well as a reduced risk of early development of 
ageassociated diseases. Further research in the field of gerontology will help 
in the future to develop a comprehensive system of measures aimed at increasing 
life expectancy and increasing individual viability.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the procedures to derive complete prevalence and several 
indicators of cancer cure from population-based cancer registries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer registry data (47% of the Italian population) were 
used to calculate limited duration prevalence for 62 cancer types by sex and 
registry. The incidence and survival models, needed to calculate the 
completeness index (R) and complete prevalence, were evaluated by likelihood 
ratio tests and by visual comparison. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
explore the effect on the complete prevalence of using different R indexes. 
Mixture cure models were used to estimate net survival (NS); life expectancy of 
fatal (LEF) cases; cure fraction (CF); time to cure (TTC); cure prevalence, 
prevalent patients who were not at risk of dying as a result of cancer; and 
already cured patients, those living longer than TTC at a specific point in 
time. CF was also compared with long-term NS since, for patients diagnosed after 
a certain age, CF (representing asymptotical values of NS) is reached far beyond 
the patient's life expectancy.
RESULTS: For the most frequent cancer types, the Weibull survival model 
stratified by sex and age showed a very good fit with observed survival. For men 
diagnosed with any cancer type at age 65-74 years, CF was 41%, while the NS was 
49% until age 100 and 50% until age 90. In women, similar differences emerged 
for patients with any cancer type or with breast cancer. Among patients alive in 
2018 with colorectal cancer at age 55-64 years, 48% were already cured (had 
reached their specific TTC), while the cure prevalence (lifelong probability to 
be cured from cancer) was 89%. Cure prevalence became 97.5% (2.5% will die 
because of their neoplasm) for patients alive >5 years after diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents an addition to the current knowledge on the 
topic providing a detailed description of available indicators of prevalence and 
cancer cure, highlighting the links among them, and illustrating their 
interpretation. Indicators may be relevant for patients and clinical practice; 
they are unambiguously defined, measurable, and reproducible in different 
countries where population-based cancer registries are active.

Curcumin is well known as a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger and 
has great potential for anti-aging applications. In this study, we investigate 
the molecular mechanism of curcumin in prolonging the lifespan of C. elegans. 
Four concentrations of curcumin (10, 25, 50, and 100 µM) were administered, and 
the optimal treatment concentration was determined by analyzing the nematode 
lifespan, physiology, and biochemistry. Additionally, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were 
performed to explore the antioxidant effect of curcumin and its underlying 
mechanism. Results revealed that curcumin could significantly improve the 
survival capacity of C. elegans without influencing its growth. Curcumin was 
observed to significantly decrease the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
under extreme conditions such as heat stress and paraquat stress. In addition, 
curcumin increased the amount of nematode mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. 
RNA-seq results revealed that the underlying mechanism of curcumin in C. elegans 
is related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. qRT-PCR 
results confirmed that the expression of oxidative stress-related genes (sod-1, 
sod-2, sod-3, gst-4) was increased, and the expression of MAPK signaling 
pathway-related genes (sek-1, pmk-1, nsy-1) was significantly downregulated. 
Furthermore, the administration of curcumin extended the lifespan of nematodes, 
potentially through the enhancement of oxidative stress resistance and the 
downregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings improve our 
understanding of both lifespan extension and the potential mechanism of curcumin 
in C. elegans.
