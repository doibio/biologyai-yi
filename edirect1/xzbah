population was hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B-infected 
patients aged 34 years. Quality-adjusted life-years were used as a measure of 
effectiveness. Long-term cumulative incidence of liver complications was also 
projected. Treatment effectiveness data were derived from the literature; 
meta-analysis was conducted when there was a large variance in reported 
effectiveness data. Costs were obtained from a cost analysis of treating chronic 
hepatitis B-related complications in Canada. Stochastic parameter uncertainty 
was examined in probabilistic sensitivity analysis by using second-order Monte 
Carlo simulation. Alternative modeling assumptions were assessed in scenario 
analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore each parameter's 
impact on the uncertainty of the results.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, telbivudine was dominated by entecavir and 
tenofovir. Tenofovir strictly dominated lamivudine, telbivudine, and entecavir. 
Over the 72-year period of the model, the expected life expectancy 
(undiscounted) of lamivudine, telbivudine, entecavir, and tenofovir was 35.71, 
36.94, 37.65, and 37.99 years, respectively. Tenofovir had the highest expected 
quality-adjusted life-years at 11.86 (discounted) in all comparisons. Scenario 
and sensitivity analyses proved the robustness of the base-case results. The 
projected 10-year cumulative incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
was 11.40% and 3.05%, respectively, for tenofovir, which is significantly lower 
than that for lamivudine.
CONCLUSION: Tenofovir generated the best results compared with all other 
therapies under evaluation.

Using health state utility values in models exploring the cost-effectiveness of 
health technologies.

BACKGROUND: To improve comparability of economic data used in decision making, 
some agencies recommend that a particular instrument should be used to measure 
health state utility values (HSUVs) used in decision-analytic models. The 
methods used to incorporate HSUVs in models, however, are often methodologically 
poor and lack consistency. Inconsistencies in the methodologies used will 
produce discrepancies in results, undermining policy decisions informed by cost 
per quality-adjusted life-years.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the current evidence base relating to 
populating decision-analytic models with HSUVs.
FINDINGS: Research exploring suitable methods to accurately reflect the baseline 
or counterfactual HSUVs in decision-analytic models is limited, and while one 
study suggested that general population data may be appropriate, guidance in 
this area is poor. Literature describing the appropriateness of different 
methods used to estimate HSUVs for combined conditions is growing, but there is 
currently no consensus on the most appropriate methodology. While exploratory 
analyses suggest that a statistical regression model might improve accuracy in 
predicted values, the models require validation and testing in external data 
sets. Until additional research has been conducted in this area, the current 
evidence suggests that the multiplicative method is the most appropriate 
technique. Uncertainty in the HSUVs used in decision-analytic models is rarely 
fully characterized in decision-analytic models and is generally poorly 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial volume of research is required before definitive 
detailed evidence-based practical advice can be provided. As the methodologies 
used can make a substantial difference to the results generated from 
decision-analytic models, the differences and lack of clarity and guidance will 
continue to lead to inconsistencies in policy decision making.

Glucose lowering should be approached by managing overall cardiovascular risk. 
Glycemic goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, 
preexisting cardiovascular disease, age, and life expectancy. Intensive glycemic 
control has consistently been shown to produce a substantial benefit for 
preventing long-term microvascular complications in both type 1 and type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Although cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death 
in patients with diabetes, microvascular complications cause substantial 
morbidity and disability. Thus, it is apparent that additional strategies on 
multimodal treatment options are necessary to promote effective management and 
prevention of diabetic complications.

Longevity-promoting effects of 4-hydroxy-E-globularinin in Caenorhabditis 
elegans.

Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India.

In modern times, there has been a major increase in the use of plants or herbal 
constituents for the prevention of age-related disorders. 
4-Hydroxy-E-globularinin (4-HEG) is an iridoid and a major component of Premna 
integrifolia. This investigation represents a breakthrough in geriatrics by 
showing the longevity-promoting activity of 4-HEG in the animal model 
Caenorhabditis elegans. 4-HEG (20μM) enhanced the mean life span of worms by 
over 18.8% under normal culture conditions and also enhanced their survival 
under oxidative stress. The longevity-promoting activity was associated with 
reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and fat accumulation in the worms. 
Gene-specific mutant studies verified the role of ROS detoxification pathways 
and simultaneous nuclear translocation of DAF-16 in the 4-HEG-mediated effects. 
Quantitative real-time PCR estimations and observations of transcriptional 
reporters indicated that 4-HEG was able to upregulate stress-inducible genes, 
viz., hsp-16.2 and sod-3. Thus, 4-HEG may serve as a lead compound of plant 
origin for the development of important nutraceuticals superseding the aging 
process.

OBJECTIVE: Estimate the health risks and benefits of mode shifts from car to 
cycling and public transport in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain.
METHODS: We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA), creating 8 different 
scenarios on the replacement of short and long car trips, by public transport 
or/and bike. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality and change in 
life expectancy related to two different assessments: A) the exposure of 
travellers to physical activity, air pollution to particulate matter <2.5 μm 
(PM2.5), and road traffic fatality; and B) the exposure of general population to 
PM2.5, modelling by Barcelona Air-Dispersion Model. The secondary outcome was a 
change in emissions of carbon dioxide.
RESULTS: The annual health impact of a shift of 40% of the car trips, starting 
and ending in Barcelona City, to cycling (n=141,690) would be for the travellers 
who shift modes 1.15 additional deaths from air pollution, 0.17 additional 
deaths from road traffic fatality and 67.46 deaths avoided from physical 
activity resulting in a total of 66.12 deaths avoided. Fewer deaths would be 
avoided annually if half of the replaced trips were shifted to public transport 
(43.76 deaths). The annual health impact in the Barcelona City general 
population (n=1,630,494) of the 40% reduction in car trips would be 10.03 deaths 
avoided due to the reduction of 0.64% in exposure to PM2.5. The deaths 
(including travellers and general population) avoided in Barcelona City 
therefore would be 76.15 annually. Further health benefits would be obtained 
with a shift of 40% of the car trips from the Greater Barcelona Metropolitan 
which either start or end in Barcelona City to public transport (40.15 deaths 
avoided) or public transport and cycling (98.50 deaths avoided).The carbon 
dioxide reduction for shifting from car to other modes of transport (bike and 
public transport) in Barcelona metropolitan area was estimated to be 
203,251t/CO₂ emissions per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce car use and increase cycling and the use of 
public transport in metropolitan areas, like Barcelona, can produce health 
benefits for travellers and for the general population of the city. Also these 
interventions help to reduce green house gas emissions.

Joint modeling quality of life and survival using a terminal decline model in 
palliative care studies.

Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.

Palliative medicine is a relatively new specialty that focuses on preventing and 
relieving the suffering of patients facing life-threatening illness. For cancer 
patients, clinical trials have been carried out to compare concurrent palliative 
care with usual cancer care in terms of longitudinal measurements of quality of 
life (QOL) until death, and overall survival is usually treated as a secondary 
endpoint. It is known that QOL of patients with advanced cancer decreases as 
death approaches; however, in previous clinical trials, this association has 
generally not been taken into account when inferences about the effect of an 
intervention on QOL or survival have been made. We developed a new joint 
modeling approach, a terminal decline model, to study the trajectory of repeated 
measurements and survival in a recently completed palliative care study. This 
approach takes the association of survival and QOL into account by modeling QOL 
retrospectively from death. For those patients whose death times are censored, 
marginal likelihood is used to incorporate them into the analysis. Our approach 
has two submodels: a piecewise linear random intercept model with serial 
correlation and measurement error for the retrospective trajectory of QOL and a 
piecewise exponential model for the survival distribution. Maximum likelihood 
estimators of the parameters are obtained by maximizing the closed-form 
expression of log-likelihood function. An explicit expression of 
quality-adjusted life years can also be derived from our approach. We present a 
detailed data analysis of our previously reported palliative care randomized 
clinical trial.

Using rate advancement periods for communicating the benefits of quitting 
smoking to older smokers.

Author information:
(1)Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research 
Center, Heidelberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Standard epidemiological measures of the risk of premature 
death from smoking might be unsuitable for risk communication in actual 
counselling situations. The rate advancement period (RAP) is an epidemiologic 
metric that could be useful for conveying information on the benefits of 
quitting. More effective risk communication could motivate older smokers to make 
an attempt at quitting. We provide empirical evidence on the impact of smoking, 
and the benefits of quitting on all-cause mortality and RAPs for people aged 60 
years and older in a large cohort of older adults.
METHODS: Smoking information was obtained from 6545 participants aged 60-74 
years of ESTHER, a population-based German cohort. Cox proportional hazards 
regression was applied to estimate associations of smoking status, amount of 
smoking and time since smoking cessation with all-cause mortality. Premature 
mortality was quantified by RAPs.
RESULTS: Current smokers had a 2.5-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality 
(adjusted HR: 2.53, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.03) and an RAP of 10.7 years when compared 
with never smokers. Strong dose-response relationships were seen with both 
current and life-time amount of smoking. Compared with current smokers, 
significant mortality reductions by 30%, 39% and 59%, and rate advancement 
reductions of 4.0, 5.6 and 10.0 years within <10 years, 10-19 years and ≥20 
years after cessation were found for former smokers, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking remains a strong risk factor for premature mortality, and 
smoking cessation remains highly beneficial also at older ages.

PA, USA.

BACKGROUND: High rates of attrition have been documented nationally in assistant 
professor faculty of U.S. medical schools. Our objective was to investigate the 
association of individual level risk factors, track of academic appointment, and 
use of institutional leave policies with departure in junior faculty of a 
research-intensive school of medicine.
METHODS: Participants included 901 faculty newly hired as assistant professors 
from July 1, 1999, through December 30, 2007, at the Perelman School of Medicine 
at the University of Pennsylvania. The faculty affairs database was used to 
determine demographics, hiring date, track of appointment, track changes, time 
to departure, and use of work-life policies for an extension of the probationary 
period for mandatory review, reduction in duties, and leave of absence.
RESULTS: Over one quarter (26.7%) of faculty departed during follow-up. Faculty 
appointed on the clinician educator or research tracks were at increased risk of 
departure compared to the tenure track (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, confidence 
interval, [CI] 1.28-2.71; HR 4.50, CI 2.91-6.96; respectively). Women appointed 
on the clinician educator track were at increased risk of departure compared to 
men (HR 1.46, CI 1.04-2.05). Faculty who took an extension of the probationary 
period were at decreased risk of departure (HR 0.36, CI 0.25-0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: At this institution, junior faculty on the tenure track were least 
likely to depart before their mandatory review compared to faculty on the 
clinician educator or research tracks. Female assistant professors on the 
clinician educator track are of significant risk for departure. Taking advantage 
of the work-life policy for an extension of the probationary period protects 
against attrition.

AIMS: The study assessed the alcoholism-related financial burden borne by 
informal care-givers and relatives of German alcoholic patients.
DESIGN: By using an exploratory approach, care-giver burden was assessed both 
prior to and 12 months after detoxification and withdrawal. Quality-of-life data 
for care-givers collected during follow-up were used to calculate the number of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by alcoholics' family members while 
their relatives are undergoing treatment.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight informal care-givers and relatives of alcoholic 
patients.
SETTING: In-patient and out-patient departments of three psychiatric university 
hospitals in Germany.
MEASUREMENTS: Expenditures of families related directly to the addiction 
disorder of alcoholic patients, quality of life of care-givers, relapses of 
patients.
FINDINGS: Families' expenditures related directly to their addicted member's 
alcoholism decreased from an average of €676.44 per month (or 20.2% of the total 
pre-tax family income) at baseline to an average of €145.40 per month at 12 
months after the beginning of treatment. The average time spent caring for the 
affected family member was reduced from 32.3 hours per month to 8.2 hours per 
month (P = 0.0109), and quality-of-life total scores increased from 60.6 to 
68.0. The total gain in QALYs for family members was 0.108. When weighed against 
the average cost of the alcoholism treatment, the cost of one QALY for 
care-giving family members was €20,398 on average.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the families of German alcoholics who receive detoxification, 
there is a substantial reduction in family expenditures, time spent caring and 
an increase in quality of life at 1 year. These are important but often 
neglected additional measures of the burden on family members and also treatment 
benefits.

Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy: perspective from 
Argentina.

Poggio R(1), Augustovsky F, Caporale J, Irazola V, Miriuka S.

Author information:
(1)Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy (IECS), Buenos Aires, 
Argentina. rpoggio@iecs.org.ar

OBJECTIVES: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has recently been shown to 
reduce both mid-term and long-term mortality in patients with mild heart 
failure. Although proven effective, it is unclear whether CRT is cost-effective 
in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Therefore, we set out to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of CRT in Argentina in patients with New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) I or II heart failure (HF). We chose to 
compare patients receiving optimal medical treatment (OMT) and CRT with those 
patients receiving only OMT.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model with a cohort simulation, and a life-time 
horizon to assess costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained as a result of treatment with both CRT and OMT from an Argentine third 
party payer perspective. We included patients who met the following criteria: 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40 percent, sinus rhythm with a QRS 
≥ 120 msec, and NYHA FC I-II HF. The results were expressed as cost per 
life-year and QALY gained in international dollars (ID$) for the year 2009.
RESULTS: For the base case analysis performed, we started at a fixed age of 65. 
After applying a 3 percent annual discount rate, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 38.005 ID$ per year of life gained and 
34.185 ID$ per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with CRT appears to be cost-effective in 
Argentina compared with patients treated solely with OMT. Similar analysis 
should be performed to determine if this treatment option is cost-effective in 
other LMIC.

Cost-effectiveness of computed tomography colonography in colorectal cancer 
screening: a systematic review.

OBJECTIVES: The European Code Against Cancer recommends individuals aged ≥ 50 
should participate in colorectal cancer screening. CT-colonography (CTC) is one 
of several screening tests available. We systematically reviewed evidence on, 
and identified key factors influencing, cost-effectiveness of CTC screening.
METHODS: PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library were searched for 
cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses of CTC-based screening, published in 
English, January 1999 to July 2010. Data was abstracted on setting, model type 
and horizon, screening scenario(s), comparator(s), participants, uptake, CTC 
performance and cost, effectiveness, ICERs, and whether extra-colonic findings 
and medical complications were considered.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified from the United States (n = 11), Canada 
(n = 2), and France, Italy, and the United Kingdom (1 each). Markov 
state-transition (n = 14) or microsimulation (n = 2) models were used. Eleven 
considered direct medical costs only; five included indirect costs. Fourteen 
compared CTC with no screening; fourteen compared CTC with colonoscopy-based 
screening; fewer compared CTC with sigmoidoscopy (8) or fecal tests (4). 
Outcomes assessed were life-years gained/saved (13), QALYs (2), or both (1). 
Three considered extra-colonic findings; seven considered complications. CTC 
appeared cost-effective versus no screening and, in general, flexible 
sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing. Results were mixed comparing CTC 
to colonoscopy. Parameters most influencing cost-effectiveness included: CTC 
costs, screening uptake, threshold for polyp referral, and extra-colonic 
findings.
CONCLUSION: Evidence on cost-effectiveness of CTC screening is heterogeneous, 
due largely to between-study differences in comparators and parameter values. 
Future studies should: compare CTC with currently favored tests, especially 
fecal immunochemical tests; consider extra-colonic findings; and conduct 
comprehensive sensitivity analyses.

Cost-utility analysis of liraglutide versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin 
in type 2 diabetes patients in China.

Gao L(1), Zhao FL, Li SC.

Author information:
(1)School of Biomedical Sciences & Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Australia.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-utility of 
liraglutide versus glimepiride as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the results of clinical trial 
conducted in Asian population.
METHODS: The validated UKPDS Outcomes Model was used to project life expectancy, 
quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), incidence of diabetes-related complication 
and cost of complications in patients receiving those regimens. Baseline cohort 
characteristics and treatment effects were derived from an Asian study. 
China-specific complication costs and utility score were taken from local 
studies. Patients' outcomes were modeled for 30 years and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for liraglutide compared with 
glimepiride from the healthcare system perspective. Both future costs and 
clinical benefits were discounted at 3 percent. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Over a period of 30 years, compared with glimepiride, liraglutide 1.8 
mg was associated with improvements in life expectancy (0.1 year) and quality 
adjusted life-year (0.168 QALY), and a reduced incidence of diabetes-related 
complications leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained 
versus glimepiride of CNY 25,6871 (DEC 2010, 1 USD = 6.6227 CNY).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections indicated that liraglutide was associated 
with increased life expectancy, QALYs, and reduced complication incidences 
comparing with glimepiride. When the UK cost of liraglutide was discounted by 38 
percent, liraglutide would be a cost-effective option in China from the 
healthcare system perspective using the 3X GDP/capita per QALY as the WTP 
threshold.

Invecchiamento, Padova, Italy. marianna.noale@in.cnr.it

INTRODUCTION: While the prolongation of life expectancy is due to medical, 
economic, social and public health advancements, longevity may not necessarily 
be an indicator of real development. Epidemiologic data indicate, in fact, that 
advanced age carries the risk of multiple diseases, disability and loss of 
autonomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: How the years gained are lived need to be assessed 
evaluating quality of life, health status, and disability.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Good health care planning should aim to ensure that the 
years of life gained are lived in good health conditions in the light of the 
World Health Organization's declaration that "increased longevity without 
quality of life is an empty prize. Health expectancy is more important than life 
expectancy"

BACKGROUND: Prolonged television (TV) viewing time is unfavourably associated 
with mortality outcomes, particularly for cardiovascular disease, but the impact 
on life expectancy has not been quantified. The authors estimate the extent to 
which TV viewing time reduces life expectancy in Australia, 2008.
METHODS: The authors constructed a life table model that incorporates a 
previously reported mortality risk associated with TV time. Data were from the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and 
Lifestyle Study, a national population-based observational survey that started 
in 1999-2000. The authors modelled impacts of changes in population average TV 
viewing time on life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: The amount of TV viewed in Australia in 2008 reduced life expectancy at 
birth by 1.8 years (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 8.4 days to 3.7 years) for 
men and 1.5 years (95% UI: 6.8 days to 3.1 years) for women. Compared with 
persons who watch no TV, those who spend a lifetime average of 6 h/day watching 
TV can expect to live 4.8 years (95% UI: 11 days to 10.4 years) less. On 
average, every single hour of TV viewed after the age of 25 reduces the viewer's 
life expectancy by 21.8 (95% UI: 0.3-44.7) min. This study is limited by the low 
precision with which the relationship between TV viewing time and mortality is 
currently known.
CONCLUSIONS: TV viewing time may be associated with a loss of life that is 
comparable to other major chronic disease risk factors such as physical 
inactivity and obesity.

Now in its 23rd and 10th years, respectively, the Antibody Engineering and 
Antibody Therapeutics conferences are the Annual Meeting of The Antibody 
Society. The scientific program covers the full spectrum of challenges in 
antibody research and development from basic science through clinical 
development. In this preview of the conferences, the chairs provide their 
thoughts on sessions that will allow participants to track emerging trends in 
(1) the development of next-generation immunomodulatory antibodies; (2) the 
complexity of the environment in which antibodies must function; (3) 
antibody-targeted central nervous system (CNS) therapies that cross the blood 
brain barrier; (4) the extension of antibody half-life for improved efficacy and 
pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD); and (5) the application of next 
generation DNA sequencing to accelerate antibody research. A pre-conference 
workshop on Sunday, December 2, 2012 will update participants on recent 
intellectual property (IP) law changes that affect antibody research, including 
biosimilar legislation, the America Invents Act and recent court cases. Keynote 
presentations will be given by Andreas Plückthun (University of Zürich), who 
will speak on engineering receptor ligands with powerful cellular responses; 
Gregory Friberg (Amgen Inc.), who will provide clinical updates of bispecific 
antibodies; James D. Marks (University of California, San Francisco), who will 
discuss a systems approach to generating tumor targeting antibodies; Dario Neri 
(Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich), who will speak about delivering 
immune modulators at the sites of disease; William M. Pardridge (University of 
California, Los Angeles), who will discuss delivery across the blood-brain 
barrier; and Peter Senter (Seattle Genetics, Inc.), who will present his vision 
for the future of antibody-drug conjugates. For more information on these

Loop-linker PCR: an advanced PCR technique for genome walking.

Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.

In this article, we developed a novel PCR method, termed loop-linker PCR, to 
isolate flanking sequences in transgenic crops. The novelty of this approach is 
its use of a stem-loop structure to design a loop-linker adapter. The adapter is 
designed to form a nick site when ligated with restricted DNA. This modification 
not only can prevent the self-ligation of adapters but also promotes the 
elongation of the 3' end of the loop-linker adapter to generate a stem-loop 
structure in the ligation products. Moreover, the suppressive effect of the 
stem-loop structure decreases nonspecific amplification and increases the 
success rate of the approach; all extension products will suppress exponential 
amplification except from the ligation product that contains the specific primer 
binding site. Using this method, 442, 1830, 107, and 512 bp left border flanking 
sequences were obtained from the transgenic maizes LY038, DAS-59122-7, Event 
3272, and the transgenic soybean MON89788, respectively. The experimental 
results demonstrated that loop-linker PCR is an efficient, reliable, and 
cost-effective method for identifying flanking sequences in transgenic crops and 
could be applied for other genome walking applications.

PURPOSE: [corrected] Active surveillance has been endorsed for low-risk prostate 
cancer, but information about long-term outcomes and comparative effectiveness 
of active surveillance is lacking. The purpose of this study is to project 
prostate cancer mortality under active surveillance followed by radical 
prostatectomy versus under immediate radical prostatectomy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A simulation model was developed to combine information on 
time from diagnosis to treatment under active surveillance and associated 
disease progression from a Johns Hopkins active surveillance cohort (n = 769), 
time from radical prostatectomy to recurrence from cases in the CaPSURE database 
with T-stage ≤ T2a (n = 3,470), and time from recurrence to prostate cancer 
death from a T-stage ≤ T2a Johns Hopkins cohort of patients whose disease 
recurred after radical prostatectomy (n = 963). Results were projected for a 
hypothetical cohort aged 40 to 90 years with low-risk prostate cancer (T-stage ≤ 
T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, and prostate-specific antigen level ≤ 10 ng/mL).
RESULTS: The model projected that 2.8% of men on active surveillance and 1.6% of 
men with immediate radical prostatectomy would die of their disease in 20 years. 
Corresponding lifetime estimates were 3.4% for active surveillance and 2.0% for 
immediate radical prostatectomy. The average projected increase in life 
expectancy associated with immediate radical prostatectomy was 1.8 months. On 
average, the model projected that men on active surveillance would remain free 
of treatment for an additional 6.4 years relative to men treated immediately.
CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance is likely to produce a very modest decline in 
prostate cancer-specific survival among men diagnosed with low-risk prostate 
cancer but could lead to significant benefits in terms of quality of life.

Palliative care for patients with advanced cancer.

Gray A(1), Ezzat A.

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The increasing life expectancy in Saudi Arabia will be accompanied by an 
alteration of the patterns of disease similar to that in Western countries. One 
of these will be cancer, the second leading cause of death in the west at 
present, where 1:3 people develop cancer during their lifetime and 1:4 die of 
it. Cancer deaths are rarely easy. The distress particularly the pain it can 
cause is legendary. Palliative care is the care and study of patients with 
active progressive far advanced disease, where cure is impossible, the prognosis 
predictably short, and the focus of care is the patient's quality of life. A 
Palliative Care Program has been developed at KFSH&RC, since 1991. This has 
broadened the spectrum of health services available to cancer patients. 
Palliative care needs to be more widely available in the kingdom to relieve an 
important cause of human suffering.

The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Korea has been believed to 
be low, but the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease in Korea is 
expected to increase because of the longer life expectancy and more ingestion of 
westernized food. The aim of this study was to report differences in the risk 
factors of reflux esophagitis (RE) according to age in Korea. We prospectively 
recruited the subjects who had RE among those who visited a health promotion 
center for upper gastrointestinal cancer surveillance at Hallym Medical Center 
(five institutions) between January 2008 and February 2009. The enrolled study 
participants comprised 742 subjects with RE and 1484 healthy controls. The 
independent risk factors of RE in young and adult group were male sex, smoking, 
coffee, body mass index ≥ 25, hiatal hernia, and Helicobacter pylori negativity. 
The risk factors of RE in elderly group were smoking, coffee, and hiatal hernia. 
The risk factors for RE according to age group were found to differ. In elderly 
group, Helicobacter pylori infection was not a significant protective factor 
contrary to young and adult groups.

Treatment for rib fracture pain can be broadly divided into pharmacologic 
approaches with oral and/or parenteral medication and interventional approaches 
utilizing neuraxial analgesia or peripheral nerve blocks to provide pain relief. 
Both approaches attempt to control nociceptive and neuropathic pain secondary to 
osseous injury and nerve insult, respectively. Success of treatment is 
ultimately measured by the ability of the selected modality to decrease pain, 
chest splinting, and to prevent sequelae of injury, such as pneumonia. 
Typically, opioids and NSAIDs are the drugs of first choice for acute pain 
because of ease of administration, immediate onset of action, and rapid 
titration to effect. In contrast, neuropathic pain medications have a slower 
onset of action and are more difficult to titrate to therapeutic effect. 
Interventional approaches include interpleural catheters, intercostal nerve 
blocks, paravertebral nerve blocks, and thoracic and lumbar epidural catheters. 
Each intervention has its own inherent advantages, disadvantages, and success 
rates. Rib fracture pain management practice is founded on the thoracic surgical 
and anesthesiology literature. Articles addressing rib fracture pain are 
relatively scarce in the pain medicine literature. As life expectancy increases, 
and as healthcare system modifications are implemented, pain medicine physicians 
may be consulted to treat increasing number of patients suffering rib fracture 
pain and may need to resort to novel therapeutic measures because of financial 
constraints imposed by those changes. Here we present the first published case 
series of thoracic epidural steroid injections used for management of rib 
fracture pain.

Onofrio 4, 00165 Rome, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Genetically defined Leigh syndrome is a rare, fatal inherited 
neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects children. No treatment is 
available. EPI-743 is a novel small molecule developed for the treatment of 
Leigh syndrome and other inherited mitochondrial diseases. In compassionate use 
cases and in an FDA Expanded Access protocol, children with Leigh syndrome 
treated with EPI-743 demonstrated objective signs of neurologic and 
neuromuscular improvement. To confirm these initial findings, a phase 2A open 
label trial of EPI-743 for children with genetically-confirmed Leigh syndrome 
was conducted and herein we report the results.
METHODS: A single arm clinical trial was performed in children with genetically 
defined Leigh syndrome. Subjects were treated for 6 months with EPI-743 three 
times daily and all were eligible for a treatment extension phase. The primary 
objective of the trial was to arrest disease progression as assessed by 
neuromuscular and quality of life metrics. Results were compared to the reported 
natural history of the disease.
RESULTS: Ten consecutive children, ages 1-13 years, were enrolled; they 
possessed seven different genetic defects. All children exhibited reversal of 
disease progression regardless of genetic determinant or disease severity. The 
primary endpoints--Newcastle Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale, the Gross 
Motor Function Measure, and PedsQL Neuromuscular Module--demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement (p<0.05). In addition, all children had an 
improvement of one class on the Movement Disorder-Childhood Rating Scale. No 
significant drug-related adverse events were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the natural history of Leigh syndrome, EPI-743 
improves clinical outcomes in children with genetically confirmed Leigh 
syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: The Appropriateness of Treating Glaucoma Suspects Study Group 
proposes to identify which patients suspected of glaucoma are suitable for 
treatment. Our objective is to analyse the concordance between our clinical 
decisions and this Study Group.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 77 patients (39 suspects, 38 ocular 
hypertensives). Variables such as age, family history, intraocular pressure, 
disc size, cup-to-disc ratio, central corneal thickness and life expectancy were 
collected.They were scored following the Appropriateness of Treating Glaucoma 
Suspects Scale. Whether there was a consensus to treat or not depended on this 
value. The kappa index was used to measured the concordancy.
RESULTS: The kappa index was 0.082 (95% confidence interval between -0.11 and 
0.27). Total concordancy was obtained in 41 patients (63,08%). We decided to 
treat 25 patients (22 of which were not treated by the experts) and not to treat 
40 patients (2 of which were treated by the experts). In 12 patients there was 
noconsensus by the experts to treat, but we decided to treat 8 of them.
CONCLUSIONS: [corrected] The concordancy index was low. Others variables such as 
visual fields and Heidelberg Retina Tomography (HRT III) parameters were not 
collected by the experts but were important in our decisions. There are no 
clinical guidelines on suspects. Individualised decisions are still necessary.

In many clinical research applications the time to occurrence of one event of 
interest, that may be obscured by another--so called competing--event, is 
investigated. Specific interventions can only have an effect on the endpoint 
they address or research questions might focus on risk factors for a certain 
outcome. Different approaches for the analysis of time-to-event data in the 
presence of competing risks were introduced in the last decades including some 
new methodologies, which are not yet frequently used in the analysis of 
competing risks data. Cause-specific hazard regression, subdistribution hazard 
regression, mixture models, vertical modelling and the analysis of time-to-event 
data based on pseudo-observations are described in this article and are applied 
to a dataset of a cohort study intended to establish risk stratification for 
cardiac death after myocardial infarction. Data analysts are encouraged to use 
the appropriate methods for their specific research questions by comparing 
different regression approaches in the competing risks setting regarding 
assumptions, methodology and interpretation of the results. Notes on application 
of the mentioned methods using the statistical software R are presented and 
extensions to the presented standard methods proposed in statistical literature 
are mentioned.

The role of functionally defective rare germline variants of sialic acid 
acetylesterase in autoimmune Addison's disease.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is a rare condition with a 
complex genetic basis. A panel of rare and functionally defective genetic 
variants in the sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE) gene has recently been 
implicated in several common autoimmune conditions. We performed a case-control 
study to determine whether these rare variants are associated with a rarer 
condition, AAD.
METHOD: We analysed nine SIAE gene variants (W48X, M89V, C196F, C226G, R230W, 
T312M, Y349C, F404S and R479C) in a United Kingdom cohort of 378 AAD subjects 
and 387 healthy controls. All samples were genotyped using Sequenom iPlex 
chemistry to characterise primer extension products.
RESULTS: A heterozygous rare allele at codon 312 (312*M) was found in one AAD 
patient (0.13%) but was not detected in the healthy controls. The commoner, 
functionally recessive variant at codon 89 (89*V) was found to be homozygous in 
two AAD patients but was only found in the heterozygous state in controls. 
Taking into account all nine alleles examined, 4/378 (1.06%) AAD patients and 
1/387 (0.25%) healthy controls carried the defective SIAE alleles, with a 
calculated odds ratio of 4.13 (95% CI 0.44-97.45, two-tailed P value 0.212, NS).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the presence of 89*V homozygotes and the 312*M rare 
allele in the AAD cohort, but overall, our analysis does not support a role for 
rare variants in SIAE in the pathogenesis of AAD. However, the relatively small 
collection of AAD patients limits the power to exclude a small effect.

life expectancy in Brazil.

Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. archandr@jhsph.edu

The road traffic crash burden is significant in Brazil; calculating years of 
life lost and life expectancy reduction quantifies the burden of road traffic 
deaths to enable prioritization of this issue. Years of life lost and reduction 
in life expectancy were calculated using 2008 population/crash data from 
Brazil's ministries of health and transport. The potential for reduction in 
crash mortality was calculated for hypothetical scenarios reducing death rates 
to those of the best-performing region and age category. In Brazil, road traffic 
deaths reduce the at-birth life expectancy by 0.8 years for males and by 0.2 
years for females. Many years of life lost for men and woman could be 
averted-270,733 and 123,986, respectively-if all rates matched those of the 
lowest-risk region and age category. This study further characterizes the burden 
of motor vehicle deaths in Brazil and quantifies the potential health benefits 
of policies/interventions that reduce road traffic death rates to those of the 
best-performing subpopulations.
