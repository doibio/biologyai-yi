specimens; each had a computed tomography (CT) image of the entire scapula and 
humerus in order to acquire topological information of the bones before RSA 
implantation. Cyclic tests were run postimplantation with 3 shoulders in each 
modalities. To quantify bone loss due to impingement, 3-dimensional anatomical 
models of the scapula were reconstructed from the CT scans and compared to their 
intact states. We found 8 bony impingements in 7 specimens: 2 at the lateral 
acromion, 1 at the inferior acromion, 4 scapular notching, and 1 with the 
glenoid resulting to wear at the 3:00 to 6:00 clock-face position. Impingements 
occurred in all kinds of tested motions, except for the internal/external 
rotation at 90° of abduction. The 3 specimens tested in abduction/adduction 
presented bone loss on the acromion side only. Scapular notching was noted in 
flexion/extension and in internal/external rotation at 0° of abduction. The 
humeral polyethylene liner was worn in 2 specimens--1 at the 6:00 to 8:00 
clock-face position during internal/external rotation at 0° of abduction and 1 
at the 4:00 clock-face position during flexion/extension. The present study 
revealed that 2 types of impingement interactions coexist and correspond to a 
frank abutment or lead to a scapular notching (friction-type impingement). 
Scapular notching seems to be caused by more movements or combination of 
movements than previously considered, and in particular by movements of 
flexion/extension and internal/external rotation with the arm at the side. 
Polyethylene cups with a notch between 3 and 9 o'clock and lower neck-shaft 
angle (145° or 135°) may play an important role in postoperative ROM limiting 
scapular notching.

The aim of the study was to analyse the level and the trends of Potential Years 
of Life Lost due to main causes of deaths in Poland in 2002-2011, with 
consideration of place of residence, urban-rural. The material for the study was 
the number of deaths due to main causes in Poland in years 2002-2011, based on 
data from the Central Statistical Office. Premature mortality analysis was 
conducted with the use of PYLL indicator (PYLL - Potential Years of Life Lost). 
PYLL rate was calculated according to the method proposed by J. Romeder, 
according to which the premature mortality was defined as death before the age 
of 70. Time trends of PYLL rate and the annual percent change (APC) were 
assessed using the Joinpoint Regression Programme. Rural/urban ratio was used to 
presented the differences in premature mortality between rural and urban areas . 
In years2002-2011, the PYLL rate for all-cause deaths decreased by 13.2% among 
men and 16.0% among women in rural areas, whereas in urban decreased it 
decreased by 15.7% among men and 14.9% among women. In 2011, the main causes of 
PYLL among men in rural areas were: external causes (32.3%), cardiovascular 
diseases (23.5%) and cancers (19.4%); in urban areas: cardiovascular diseases 
(24.7%), external causes (24.3%) and cancers (20.9%). Among women in rural 
areas, the leading causes were: cancers (39.9%), cardiovascular diseases (20.1%) 
and external causes (15.1%). The main causes of premature mortality among women 
in urban areas were: cancers (41.7%), cardiovascular diseases (19.6%) and 
external causes (11.1%). Premature mortality among men in rural areas was 
significantly higher than in urban for all analysed causes of death, with the 
exception of ischaemic heart diseases and colorectal cancer. Premature mortality 
among women in rural areas was significantly lower than in urban for all 
analysed cause of deaths, except of cerebrovascular diseases, external causes, 
suicides and traffic accidents. The presented epidemiological situation for 
premature mortality indicate differences in the state of health of the 
inhabitants in urban and rural areas in Poland. The leading causes of premature 
mortality are caused by preventable deaths, which leads to a need to intensify 
measures in primary and secondary prevention.

Latonopsis australis is a rare Cladocera inhabiting the entire stretch of the 
Cochin backwaters, the largest monsoonal estuary along the West Coast of India, 
during the summer monsoon, but restricted to the upper reaches during the 
non-monsoon periods. Here, we present the results of an experimental study, 
which assessed the influence of salinity on the life table demography of the 
species at different salinity levels. The life table demographic parameters such 
as net reproduction rate, generation time, intrinsic growth rate, gross 
reproductive rate, and survivorship of the species were measured in different 
salinities ranging from freshwater to mesohaline levels (salinity 14). The study 
showed that higher salinity had a significant negative effect on all life table 
demography parameters of the species, whereas freshwater to low saline 
conditions (salinity up to 8) favored the survivorship, life expectancy, net 
production, and growth rate. It was also noticed that salinity above 8 caused a 
significant decrease in the survivorship, life expectancy, and reproduction rate 
of the species, which clearly explained the seasonal distribution pattern of the 
species in the Cochin backwaters. The present study suggests salinity 2 to 6 as 
the optimum range for the large-scale production of L. australis for purposes 
like live feed in aquaculture.

Medical care can be both "a blessing and a curse". The contributions of 
medicines to increased human lifespan and falling mortality from the major 
cardiovascular diseases are undisputed. However, in lockstep with remarkable 
extension of human lifespan has been increase in the numbers of people living 
with chronic age related neurodegenerative conditions and frailty. In frail, 
multi-morbid populations, with limited homeostatic reserve and life expectancy, 
the balance between the risk and harms of medicines can be in equipoise. In this 
context the number of older people living with dementia is increasing, and 
understanding threats to the quality of life of people with dementia is of 
growing significance. Among the myriad potential causes of harm to older people 
with dementia, in this issue of the journal Mitchell and colleagues present new 
Australian data reminding us of the importance of admissions due to both 
intentional and unintentional poisoning.

Time-dependent covariates can be modeled within the Cox regression framework and 
can allow both proportional and nonproportional hazards for the risk factor of 
research interest. However, in many areas of health services research, interest 
centers on being able to estimate residual longevity after the occurrence of a 
particular event such as stroke. The survival trajectory of patients 
experiencing a stroke can be potentially influenced by stroke type (hemorrhagic 
or ischemic), time of the stroke (relative to time zero), time since the stroke 
occurred, or a combination of these factors. In such situations, researchers are 
more interested in estimating lifetime lost due to stroke rather than merely 
estimating the relative hazard due to stroke. To achieve this, we propose an 
ensemble approach using the generalized gamma distribution by means of a 
semi-Markov type model with an additive hazards extension. Our modeling 
framework allows stroke as a time-dependent covariate to affect all three 
parameters (location, scale, and shape) of the generalized gamma distribution. 
Using the concept of relative times, we answer the research question by 
estimating residual life lost due to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in the 
chronic dialysis population.

We aimed to develop a decision aid that estimates whether treatment of latent 
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is likely to have a net gain in quality-adjusted 
life-years for an individual. A Markov model was developed which incorporated 
personalised estimates for risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation, TB death, 
quality-of-life impairments and treatment side-effects. The net effect of LTBI 
treatment was quantified in terms of quality-adjusted life-years gained or lost. 
Analyses were conducted for a representative set of hypothetical patients. LTBI 
treatment was estimated to be beneficial when the annual risk of TB reactivation 
exceeded 13/100,000 to 93/100,000 for females aged 10-75 years and 15/100,000 to 
119/100,000 for males aged 10-75 years; the numbers needed to treat to avoid one 
case of TB were 93, 77, 85 and 72, respectively, at these threshold levels. LTBI 
treatment was estimated to confer a positive net benefit across a broad range of 
patients with characteristics typically seen in a low incidence setting for TB. 
Use of the decision aid has the potential to facilitate and increase confidence 
with LTBI treatment decisions by providing clinicians and patients with 
personalised estimates of likely net benefit.

The current Western diet figures centrally in the pathogenesis of several 
chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and 
the emerging major health problem nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, all of them 
negatively impacting on life expectancy. This type of diet is represented by a 
high calorie uptake, high glycemic load, high fat and meat intake, as well as 
increased consumption of fructose. On the contrary, a simplified way of eating 
healthily by excluding highly-processed foods, is presumed to be the Paleolithic 
diet (a diet based on vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, meat, organ meats) which 
improves insulin resistance, ameliorates dyslipidemia, reduces hypertension and 
may reduce the risk of age-related diseases. The diet is the foundation of the 
treatment of obesity- and type 2 diabetes-related nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease and a diet similar to those of pre-agricultural societies may be an 
effective option. To lend sufficient credence to this type of diet, 
well-designed studies are needed.

BACKGROUND: Conservative treatments have been proved to be effective to control 
pain and optimize function in fibromyalgia, however there is need for scientific 
evidence to make better clinical application across various physiotherapy 
applications.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Laser and 
taping applications on pain, flexibility, anxiety, depression, functional status 
and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.
METHODS: Forty-five female patients with fibromyalgia syndrome were included to 
the study and randomly allocated into three treatment groups; Laser (n= 15), 
placebo Laser (n= 15), and taping applications (n= 15). Visual analogue scale 
for pain intensity, trunk flexibility, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire for 
functional status, Short Form 36 Questionnaire for quality of life and health 
status, and Beck Depression Inventory for anxiety level were evaluated before 
and after three weeks interventions.
RESULTS: There were decreased pain severity in activity (p= 0.028), anxiety 
level (p= 0.01) and improved general health status, quality of life (p= 0.01) 
found at Laser group, whereas there were increased trunk flexibility, flexion 
(p= 0.03), extension (p= 0.02) found at taping group. After interventions, there 
were decreased pain severity for whole groups at night for Laser group (p= 
0.04), placebo Laser group (p= 0.001), taping group (p= 0.01) and improved 
functional status found for Laser group (p= 0.001), placebo Laser group (p= 
0.001), taping group (p= 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Kinesiotape application had a similar effect on parameters in FMS 
patient, so this method could be preferred instead of Laser application for 
rehabilitation program.

The objective of this paper was to assess the cost-utility of fidaxomicin versus 
vancomycin in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in three 
specific CDI patient subgroups: those with cancer, treated with concomitant 
antibiotic therapy or with renal impairment. A Markov model with six health 
states was developed to assess the cost-utility of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin 
in the patient subgroups over a period of 1 year from initial infection. Cost 
and outcome data used to parameterise the model were taken from Spanish sources 
and published literature. The costs were from the Spanish hospital perspective, 
in Euros (€) and for 2013. For CDI patients with cancer, fidaxomicin was 
dominant versus vancomycin [gain of 0.016 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and savings of €2,397 per patient]. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of €30,000 
per QALY gained, the probability that fidaxomicin was cost-effective was 96 %. 
For CDI patients treated with concomitant antibiotic therapy, fidaxomicin was 
the dominant treatment versus vancomycin (gain of 0.014 QALYs and savings of 
€1,452 per patient), with a probability that fidaxomicin was cost-effective of 
94 %. For CDI patients with renal impairment, fidaxomicin was also dominant 
versus vancomycin (gain of 0.013 QALYs and savings of €1,432 per patient), with 
a probability that fidaxomicin was cost-effective of 96 %. Over a 1-year time 
horizon, when fidaxomicin is compared to vancomycin in CDI patients with cancer, 
treated with concomitant antibiotic therapy or with renal impairment, the use of 
fidaxomicin would be expected to result in increased QALYs for patients and 
reduced overall costs.

BACKGROUND: Rankings from the World Health Organization (WHO) place the US 
health care system as one of the least efficient among Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Researchers have questioned this, 
noting simplistic or inappropriate methodologies, poor measurement choice, and 
poor control variables. Our objective is to re-visit this question by using 
newer modeling techniques and a large panel of OECD data.
METHODS: We primarily use the OECD Health Data for 25 OECD countries. We compare 
results from stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and fixed effects models. We 
estimate total life expectancy as well as life expectancy at age 60. We explore 
a combination of control variables reflecting health care resources, health 
behaviors, and economic and environmental factors.
RESULTS: The US never ranks higher than fifth out of all 36 models, but is also 
never the very last ranked country though it was close in several models. The 
SFA estimation approach produces the most consistent lead country, but the 
remaining countries did not maintain a steady rank.
DISCUSSION: Our study sheds light on the fragility of health system rankings by 
using a large panel and applying the latest efficiency modeling techniques. The 
rankings are not robust to different statistical approaches, nor to variable 
inclusion decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Future international comparisons should employ a range of 
methodologies to generate a more nuanced portrait of health care system 
efficiency.

BACKGROUND: Hidden blood loss is a major factor influencing functional recovery 
and quality of life in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Special hip 
and knee flexion positions after have been reported to have promising results 
with respect to reducing perioperative blood loss. The purpose of this study was 
to determine the effect of postoperative leg position on blood loss and 
functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: We enrolled 46 consecutive patients with degenerative osteoarthritis of 
the knee in this prospective, randomized study. The patients were randomly 
allocated to a flexion or an extension group. In the flexion group, the affected 
leg was elevated by 60° at the hip, and the knee was flexed by 60°, while in the 
extension group, the affected knee was fully extended postoperatively. Blood 
loss, hemoglobin level, knee circumference and range of motion (ROM) were 
recorded to determine the influence of postoperative leg position on clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Although the transfusion rate was similar between the two groups (P > 
0.05), other parameters related to blood loss (including calculated blood loss, 
hidden blood loss and postoperative knee circumference) were significantly lower 
in the flexion group than in the extension group (P < 0.05). After 6 weeks of 
rehabilitation, patients from the flexion group had gained a better ROM in the 
affected knee than had patients from the extension group (P = 0.04). At 6 
months, however, the ROM of the affected knee was similar in both groups. The 
hospital stay was 1.9 days shorter in the flexion group than in the extension 
group. Wound infection rates were similar in both groups, and no proven case of 
deep vein thrombosis was observed in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of the hip by 60° with 60° knee flexion is an effective 
and simple method to reduce blood loss after primary unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty, and contributes to better recovery of the functional ROM in the 
early postoperative period.

Heat-resistant fungal spores present a processing challenge for beverages and 
fruit juices, as thermal and UV strategies are often inadequate in reducing 
heat-resistant fungal burdens to acceptable levels. While effective against 
pathogenic or invasive bacteria, germicidal UV light treatments also fail to 
achieve an appreciable reduction of heat-resistant fungal spores. As an 
alternative, the efficacy of the antifungal protein YvgO was examined across a 
selection of fruit juices and teas, as well as solid model matrices. Compared 
with its efficacy in analogous liquid matrices, the apparent efficacy of YvgO 
was diminished on acidified solid matrices due to a reduction in YvgO diffusion. 
Using an XTT 
[2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] 
tetrazolium dye cytotoxicity assay, the effective concentrations to reduce 
growth by 50% were elucidated in samples challenged with Byssochlamys fulva H25. 
The MICs were determined and ranged from 2 ppm in apple juice and acidified teas 
to approximately 3 to 12 ppm for lemonade and orange, white cranberry, 
blueberry, prune, cherry, and grape juices. Apple cider and nonacidified teas 
showed reduced efficacy, with MICs exceeding 100 ppm. Tannin-rich products 
readily removed YvgO from the product, impairing its efficacy. Adding bovine 
serum albumin as a competitive inhibitor effectively reversed the YvgO-tannin 
association and restored efficacy in black but not green tea matrices. When 
challenged with a 5-log CFU inoculum of B. fulva, the shelf lives of the 
products were extended for various times up to 28 days in a 
concentrationdependent manner. However, initial efficacy was not predictive of 
shelf life extension, as some products exhibited improved protection at just 
two- and fourfold concentrations above the MIC, while others only exhibited 
long-term stability when concentrations exceeded 20 times the MIC. As such, YvgO 
may be an attractive alternative to currently available protection strategies 
and will provide needed diversity for natural food protectants.

Hospital, Odense, Denmark.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average postponement of death in statin trials.
SETTING: A systematic literature review of all statin trials that presented 
all-cause survival curves for treated and untreated.
INTERVENTION: Statin treatment compared to placebo.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The average postponement of death as represented by 
the area between the survival curves.
RESULTS: 6 studies for primary prevention and 5 for secondary prevention with a 
follow-up between 2.0 and 6.1 years were identified. Death was postponed between 
-5 and 19 days in primary prevention trials and between -10 and 27 days in 
secondary prevention trials. The median postponement of death for primary and 
secondary prevention trials were 3.2 and 4.1 days, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment results in a surprisingly small average gain in 
overall survival within the trials' running time. For patients whose life 
expectancy is limited or who have adverse effects of treatment, withholding 
statin therapy should be considered.

AIM: Adjuvant treatment is still controversially discussed for elderly colon 
cancer (CC) patients. Our aim was to investigate the benefit of adjuvant 
treatment for younger (<70 years) and elderly (≥70 years) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The long-term outcome of patients (n=855) enrolled in a 
randomized controlled trial comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU alone, 
5-FU plus folinic acid (FA), and 5-FU plus interferon-alpha (IFNa) was compared 
in younger (<70 years) and elderly (≥70 years) patients using a quotient of each 
patient's survival time and his expected residual life expectancy (QSL) and a 
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Eight-year overall survival (OS) rates were 58.3% and 57.4% for younger 
(n=653) and elderly (n=202) patients, respectively. In elderly patients, 8-year 
OS rates were 51.4%, 61.8%, and 56.3, and median QSL scores were 0.338, 0.371, 
and 0.343 for 5-FU (n=59), 5-FU plus FA (n=76), and 5-FU plus IFNa (n=67), 
respectively. In elderly patients treatment with 5-FU plus FA decreased the risk 
for an event by 1.5-fold compared to 5-FU (HR=0.657, 95%CI=0.495-0.870, p=0.004) 
and 5-FU plus INFa (HR=0.685, 95%CI=0.515-0.912, p=0.009).
CONCLUSION: Our analysis clearly demonstrates for the first time an additional 
benefit of FA for adjuvant treatment of elderly CC patients. We conclude that 
this regimen is very safe and effective for adjuvant treatment of elderly 
patients.

The relationship of life expectancy to the development and valuation of life 
care plans.

BACKGROUND: A life care plan often analyzes needs up to a person's life 
expectancy. Expected present value of necessary funding for such a plan is 
likewise based on the fixed survival time. If a client should live beyond or die 
before the life expectancy, a shortfall or excess of funding may seem 
inevitable. The life table, of which life expectancy is a summary measure, 
clarifies these issues.
OBJECTIVES: We explain life expectancy and how it is used in tort litigation, 
economic calculations, and life care planning. We examine the life table, of 
which life expectancy is one output. We illustrate how a life table provides 
age-specific probabilities of death and survival, life expectancies, and median 
survival times, and other information and that every life expectancy must be 
associated with a life table. We consider the implications for life care 
planners, forensic economists, and others.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is a summary of more detailed information provided 
in a life table. The full life table provides better information for planning 
purposes. Whether life expectancy or a full life table should be used in 
developing and valuing a life care plan is not well understood. A 
multi-disciplinary approach may help clarify these issues.

A note on survival after anoxic brain injury in adolescents and young adults.

Shavelle RM, Brooks JC, Strauss DJ, Paculdo DR.

BACKGROUND: Much is known about survival after traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet 
relatively little about survival after anoxic brain injury (ABI).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-term survival after ABI is comparable to 
that after TBI.
METHODS: We identified 237 patients with ABI and 1,620 with TBI in California 
who were aged 15 to 35, survived at least 1 year post injury, and were injured 
in 1986 or later. We analyzed the long-term follow-up data using the Cox 
Proportional Hazards Regression Model, controlling for age, sex, and severity of 
disability.
RESULTS: After adjustment for risk factors, no significant differences in 
long-term survival between ABI and TBI were found (hazard ratio = 0.97; 95% c.i. 
0.57-1.65).
CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents and young adults, long-term survival after ABI 
appears to be similar to that after TBI.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
erlotinib or afatinib, or chemotherapy cisplatin-pemetrexed, for first-line 
treatment of advanced epithelial growth factor receptor mutation-positive 
non-small-cell lung cancer in the United States. We also assessed the expected 
benefit of further research to reduce uncertainty regarding which treatment is 
optimal.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
erlotinib, afatinib, and cisplatin-pemetrexed. Model transition and 
adverse-effect probabilities were from two published phase III trials: EURTAC 
(Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European 
patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer) and 
LUX-Lung (Afatinib versus cisplatin-based chemotherapy for EGFR 
mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma) 3. EURTAC survival estimates were 
corrected for patients entering the trial with more severe disease, compared 
with LUX-Lung 3. Health utilities and costs were from national estimates or the 
published literature. Inputs were modeled as distributions for probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis 
to estimate the expected benefit of reducing uncertainty regarding the decision 
of optimal treatment.
RESULTS: In the base case, both tyrosine kinase inhibitors were more 
cost-effective than cisplatin-pemetrexed. Erlotinib had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $61,809/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared 
with afatinib. The acceptability curve showed that erlotinib was the optimal 
treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY (10-year population 
EVPI = $85.9 million). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY to 
$70,000/QALY (EVPI = $211.5 million-$261.8 million), however, there was 
considerable uncertainty whether erlotinib or afatinib was the optimal 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that erlotinib is the preferred first-line 
treatment for advanced epithelial growth factor receptor mutation-positive 
non-small-cell lung cancer. Further research comparing erlotinib and afatinib is 
potentially justified, although accurate data are needed on the required cost 
and sample size of the trial.

BACKGROUND: Mirabegron, a first-in-class selective oral β3-adrenoceptor agonist, 
has similar efficacy to most antimuscarinic agents and a lower incidence of dry 
mouth in patients with overactive bladder (OAB).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron 50 mg compared with 
oral antimuscarinic agents in adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model including health states for symptom severity, treatment 
status, and adverse events was developed. Cycle length was 1 month, and the time 
horizon was 5 years. Antimuscarinic comparators were tolterodine extended 
release, solifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin extended release and immediate 
release (IR), darifenacin, and trospium chloride modified release. Transition 
probabilities for symptom severity levels and adverse events were estimated from 
a mirabegron trial and a mixed treatment comparison. Estimates for other inputs 
were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and total health care costs, including costs of drug 
acquisition, physician visits, incontinence pad use, and botox injections, were 
modeled. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from £367 (vs. 
solifenacin 10 mg) to £15,593 (vs. oxybutynin IR 10 mg) per QALY gained. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of £20,000/QALY gained, the probability of mirabegron 50 mg being cost-effective 
ranged from 70.2% versus oxybutynin IR 10 mg to 97.8% versus darifenacin 15 mg. 
A limitation of our analysis is the uncertainty due to the lack of direct 
comparisons of mirabegron with other agents; a mixed treatment comparison using 
rigorous methodology provided the data for the analysis, but the studies 
involved showed heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Mirabegron 50 mg appears to be cost-effective compared with 
standard oral antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of adults with OAB from a 
UK National Health Service perspective.

BACKGROUND: Seven drugs are licensed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B 
(CHB) in the United Kingdom. Which initial treatment, secondary therapy, and 
whether antivirals should be given alone or in combination are questions of 
considerable uncertainty.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this model was to undertake a comprehensive economic 
evaluation of all antiviral treatments for CHB to recommend the most 
cost-effective therapeutic sequence.
METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of all clinically relevant antiviral treatment sequences for 
nucleos(t)ide-naive adults with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive or 
HBeAg-negative CHB. Relative rates of HBeAg seroconversion and viral suppression 
were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Data on mortality, antiviral drug 
resistance, durability of response, adverse events, and costs were obtained from 
published literature. Results are reported in terms of lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and expected net benefit.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, pegylated interferon alpha-2a (peg-IFN α-2a) 
followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was most effective and cost-effective 
in HBeAg-positive patients, with a cost of £7488 per QALY gained compared with 
no treatment. In HBeAg-negative patients, peg-IFN α-2a followed by entecavir was 
most effective and cost-effective, with a cost of £6981 per QALY gained. The 
model was robust to a wide range of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Peg-IFN α-2a followed by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or entecavir 
is the most effective antiviral treatment strategy for people with both variants 
of CHB. At a cost of less than £10,000 per QALY gained, these sequences are 
considered cost-effective in England and Wales. The results of this analysis 
were used to inform 2013 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guideline recommendations.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) 
compared with open surgery (OS) techniques for one- or two-level lumbar spinal 
fusion in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal conditions in the United 
Kingdom and Italy.
METHODS: A health economic model was developed on the basis of results from a 
systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of MIS compared with OS for lumbar spinal fusion. The 
analysis was conducted from a health care payer perspective. Parameters included 
in the model were surgery, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, 
postoperative complications, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). 
Cost-effectiveness was determined by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained.
RESULTS: MIS was the dominant strategy compared with OS (i.e., yielding both 
cost savings and improved HRQOL). Cost savings were driven mainly by shorter 
length of hospital stay, reduced blood loss, and fewer complications such as 
surgical site infection. The total cost saving per procedure was €973 for Italy 
and €1666 for the United Kingdom, with an improvement of 0.04 quality-adjusted 
life-year over 2 years in HRQOL. One-way sensitivity analyses and predefined 
scenario(s) analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: MIS is a less expensive and a more effective treatment compared 
with OS for spinal lumbar fusion in both Italy and the United Kingdom. Lower 
downstream costs and increased HRQOL in the MIS group compensate for potential 
higher upfront costs of MIS implants and surgery equipment.

OBJECTIVES: To describe a population with moderate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
before biologic initiation and assess change in disease status, health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL), and adverse events in etanercept (ETN)-treated 
patients.
METHODS: Data on adult patients with moderate RA (3.2 < Disease Activity Score 
in 28 Joints [DAS28] ≤ 5.1) were retrospectively analyzed from the British 
Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register comparing a nonbiologic-treated 
group (nBG) using at least one traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
to a biologic group (BG) treated with ETN. The HRQOL was assessed by using the 
Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index score. To mitigate confounding, 
we controlled for drivers of progression. Appropriate univariate, multivariate, 
and regression analyses were used.
RESULTS: A total of 1754 patients with RA were assessed (211 BG and 1543 nBG). 
Compared with the nBG, the BG tended toward higher disease activity, such as 
significantly higher tender joints and DAS28. The BG compared with the nBG had 
1) a greater reduction in DAS28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores; 2) 
disease remission occurring more often (odds ratio = 2.7; P = 0.006); and 3) 
progression occurring in fewer patients (odds ratio = 0.3; P = 0.002). BG 
patients had a higher incidence of "other serious infection" and "other central 
nervous system-related events," with no significant differences in associated 
hospitalization rates or deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with moderate RA from a clinical practice registry, 
ETN-treated patients had significantly higher disease activity at the time of 
biologic initiation but significantly reduced disease activity and better HRQOL 
after 6 months compared with nBG patients, although the possibility of 
unmeasured confounding remains. The ETN group reported significantly higher 
incidences of "other serious infections" and "other central nervous 
system-related events" without higher hospitalization rates.
