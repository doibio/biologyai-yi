for patients with PAH remains poor. Showing many similarities to cancers, PAH is 
characterized by increased pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation, 
decreased apoptotic signaling pathways, and changes in metabolism. The recent 
successes of therapies targeting epigenetic modifiers for the treatment of 
cancer has prompted epigenetic research in PAH, revealing many new potential 
therapeutic targets. In this minireview we discuss the emergence of epigenetic 
dysregulation in PAH and highlight epigenetic-targeting compounds that may be 
effective for the treatment of PAH.

Aging is known to be one of the major risk factors in many neurodegenerative 
diseases (ND) whose prevalence is estimated to rise in the coming years due to 
the increase in life expectancy. Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include 
Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, along with Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis, Spinocerebellar ataxias and Frontotemporal Dementia. Given 
that so far these ND do not have effective pharmacological therapies, a better 
understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms can contribute to 
development of effective treatments. During the previous decade, the data 
indicated that dysregulation of MAP kinases [which included c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and p38] 
are associated with several stages of the inflammatory process which in turn 
contributes to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This evidence suggests 
that control of inflammation through regulation of MAP kinase could be a 
worthwhile approach against neurodegenerative diseases. In this review we 
summarize the pathways of MAP kinase signal transduction and different 
pharmacological inhibitors that can be used in its modulation against ND.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is routine in some 
countries with high incidence and is associated with reduced gastric 
cancer-related mortality. Immigrants from countries of high incidence to low 
incidence of gastric cancer retain their elevated risk, but no screening 
recommendations have been made for these groups in the United States. We aimed 
to determine the cost effectiveness of different endoscopic screening strategies 
for noncardia gastric cancer, compared with no screening, among Chinese, 
Filipino, Southeast Asian, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese Americans.
METHODS: We generated a decision-analytic Markov model to simulate a cohort of 
asymptomatic 50-year-old Asian Americans. The cost effectiveness of 2 distinct 
strategies for endoscopic gastric cancer screening was compared with no 
screening for each group, stratified by sex. Outcome measures were reported in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Compared with performing no endoscopic gastric cancer screening, 
performing a 1-time upper endoscopy with biopsies, with continued endoscopic 
surveillance if gastric intestinal metaplasia was identified, was cost 
effective, whereas performing ongoing biennial endoscopies, even for patients 
with normal findings from endoscopy and histopathology, was not. The lowest 
ICERs were observed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans (all 
<$73,748/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer with ongoing surveillance 
of gastric preneoplasia is cost effective for Asian Americans ages 50 years or 
older in the United States. The lowest ICERs were for Chinese, Japanese, and 
Korean Americans (all <$73,748/QALY).

Implementation of strict policies for mitigating climate change has a direct 
impact on public health as far as the external health costs of electricity 
generation can be reduced, thanks to the reduction of emission of typical 
pollutants by switching to cleaner low carbon fuels and achieving energy 
efficiency improvements. Renewables have lower external health costs due to the 
lower life cycle emission of typical air pollutants linked to electricity 
generation, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter, NH3, or NMVOC (Non-methane 
volatile organic compounds), which all appear to have serious negative effects 
on human health. Our case study performed in the Baltic States analyzed the 
dynamics of external health costs in parallel with the dynamics of the main 
health indicators in these countries: life expectancy at birth, mortality rates, 
healthy life years, self-perceived health, and illness indicators. We employed 
the data for external health costs retrieved from the CASES database, as well as 
the health statistics data compiled from the EUROSTAT database. The time range 
of the study was 2010-2018 due to the availability of consistent health 
indicators for the EU Member States. Our results show that the decrease of 
external health costs had a positive impact on the increase of the 
self-perceived good health and reduction of long-standing illness as well as the 
decrease of infant death rate. Our conclusions might be useful for other 
countries as well as for understanding the additional benefits of climate change 
mitigation policies and tracking their positive health impacts. The cooperation 
initiatives on clean energy and climate change mitigation between countries like 
One Belt One Road initiative by the Chinese government can also yield additional 
benefits linked to the public health improvements.

Musculoskeletal dysfunctions are highly prevalent due to increasing life 
expectancy. Consequently, novel solutions to optimize treatment of patients are 
required. The current major research focus is to develop innovative concepts for 
single tissues. However, interest is also emerging to generate applications for 
tissue transitions where highly divergent properties need to work together, as 
in bone-cartilage or bone-tendon transitions. Finding medical solutions for 
dysfunctions of such tissue transitions presents an added challenge, both in 
research and in clinics. This review aims to provide an overview of the 
anatomical structure of healthy adult entheses and their development during 
embryogenesis. Subsequently, important scientific progress in restoration of 
damaged entheses is presented. With respect to enthesis dysfunction, the review 
further focuses on inflammation. Although molecular, cellular and tissue 
mechanisms during inflammation are well understood, tissue regeneration in 
context of inflammation still presents an unmet clinical need and goes along 
with unresolved biological questions. Furthermore, this review gives particular 
attention to the potential role of a signaling mediator protein, transforming 
growth factor beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is at the node of 
regenerative and inflammatory signaling and is one example for a less regarded 
aspect and potential important link between tissue regeneration and 
inflammation.

Grapevine red blotch disease (GRBD) is a recently identified viral disease that 
affects grapevines. GRBD has been shown to impact grapevine physiology and grape 
composition by altering specific ripening events. However, no studies have been 
reported on the impact of GRBD on wine composition and its sensory attributes. 
This study evaluated the impact of GRBD on wine primary and secondary 
metabolites, in addition to its sensory properties, when making wines from 
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes during two seasons. Wines made with 
GRBD-impacted fruit were lower in ethanol content when compared to wines made 
with grapes from healthy grapevines. This was attributed to the lower total 
soluble sugar (TSS) levels of diseased grapes due to delayed ripening at 
harvest. GRBD impacted wine phenolic composition by decreasing anthocyanin 
concentrations and increasing flavonol concentrations in some instances. 
Additionally, proanthocyanidin concentrations were also consistently higher in 
GRBD wines compared to wines made from healthy fruit. Descriptive analysis 
demonstrated that GRBD can impact wine style by altering aroma, flavor, and 
mouthfeel attributes. However, the extent of GRBD impact on wine composition and 
sensory properties were site and season dependent.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of 
cancer-specific death in both sexes in Western countries. KRAS mutations occur 
in about 50% of metastatic CRCs (mCRCs). The prognostic value of specific KRAS 
mutations still remains unexplored and unclear.
METHODS: Two hundred and forty KRAS wild-type and 206 KRAS/NRAS mutant 
consecutive unresectable mCRC patients with PS Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) 0 or 1, aged < 80 years, and with a life expectancy >3 months 
entered into this study. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed 
tumour tissues, and it was sequenced with the Oncomine Solid Tumour DNA kit 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Data were analysed using the 
Torrent Suite Software v5.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primary outcome was 
the analysis of the prognostic role of different KRAS mutations in terms of 
overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the most prevalent 
mutations (p.G12D, p.G12V, p.G13D, p.G12A, p.G12C, and p.G12S) in terms of age 
(<65 vs. ≥65 years), gender (male vs. female), grading (G1/G2 vs. G3), side of 
primary tumour (left vs. right), pT, and pN. At the median follow-up of 25.6 
months, there were 77 deaths in KRAS-mutated patients and 94 in wild-type 
patients. Three homogeneous prognostic groups were identified: wild-type 
patients (group A, median survival: 27.5 months), p.G13D/p.G12A/p.G12V/p.G12D 
mutants (group B, median survival: 17.3 months), and p.G12C/p.G12S mutants 
(group C, median survival: 5.0 months, p < 0.0001 according to Log Rank test). 
Upon multivariate analysis, metastatic involvement and p.G12C/p.G12S KRAS 
mutation group C (vs. other mutations) emerged as independent prognostic 
variables for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that mutant KRAS is a negative prognostic factor and that 
p.G12C/p.G12S variants present the worst clinical courses. This information 
suggests a clear difference among KRAS mutations, and it will be useful to test 
potentiated and/or innovative therapeutic strategies in p.G12C/p.G12S metastatic 
CRC patients.

Little is known about the relationship between self-reported psychological 
resilience (resilience) and health behaviors shown to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study examines the associations between 
resilience and CVD-related risk factors, such as diet, smoking, physical 
activity, sleep, and alcohol consumption among older American women from diverse 
backgrounds.
METHODS: A cross-sectional secondary analysis was conducted on 77,395 women 
(mean age 77 years, Black (N = 4475, 5.8%), non-Hispanic white (N = 69,448, 
89.7%), Latina (N = 1891, 2.4%), and Asian or Pacific Islander (N = 1581, 2.0%)) 
enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Extension Study II. Resilience was 
measured using an abbreviated version of the brief resilience scale. 
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association 
between resilience and health behaviors associated with risk for CVD, while 
adjusting for stressful life events and sociodemographic information. To test 
whether these associations varied among racial/ethnic groups, an interaction 
term was added to the fully adjusted models between resilience and 
race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: High levels of resilience were associated with better diet quality (top 
2 quintiles of the Healthy Eating Index 2015) (OR = 1.22 (95% Confidence 
Interval (1.15-1.30)), adhering to recommended physical activity (≥ 150 min per 
week) (1.56 (1.47, 1.66)), sleeping the recommended hours per night (7-9) (1.36 
(1.28-1.44)), and moderate alcohol intake (consuming alcoholic drink(s) 1-7 days 
per week) (1.28 (1.20-1.37)). The observed association between resilience and 
sleep is modified by race/ethnicity (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Irrespective of race/ethnicity, high resilience was associated with 
CVD-protective health behaviors. This warrants further investigation into 
whether interventions aimed at improving resilience could increase the 
effectiveness of lifestyle interventions.

In recent years, the prevalence of amyloid neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has significantly increased in developed countries due 
to increased life expectancy. This amyloid disease is characterized by the 
presence of accumulations and deposits of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in neuronal 
tissue, leading to the formation of oligomers, fibers, and plaques. First, 
oligomeric intermediates that arise during the aggregation process are currently 
thought to be primarily responsible for cytotoxicity in cells. This work aims to 
provide further insights into the mechanisms of cytotoxicity by studying the 
interaction of Aβ aggregates with Neuro-2a (N2a) neuronal cells and the effects 
caused by this interaction. For this purpose, we have exploited the advantages 
of advanced, multidimensional fluorescence microscopy techniques to determine 
whether different types of Aβ are involved in higher rates of cellular toxicity, 
and we measured the cellular stress caused by such aggregates by using a 
fluorogenic intracellular biothiol sensor. Stress provoked by the peptide is 
evident by N2a cells generating high levels of biothiols as a defense mechanism. 
In our study, we demonstrate that Aβ aggregates act as seeds for aggregate 
growth upon interacting with the cellular membrane, which results in cell 
permeability and damage and induces lysis. In parallel, these damaged cells 
undergo a significant increase in intracellular biothiol levels.

Bradykinin (BK) and bradykinin-related peptides (BRPs), which were identified 
from a diversity of amphibian skin secretions, exerted contractile and relaxing 
effects on non-vascular and vascular smooth muscle, respectively. Here, we 
report a novel bradykinin-related peptide with a molecular mass of 1890.2 Da, 
RVAGPDKPARISGLSPLR, which was isolated and identified from Ordorrana 
hejiangensis skin secretions, followed by a C-terminal extension sequence 
VAPQIV. The biosynthetic precursor-encoding cDNA was cloned by the "shotgun" 
cloning method, and the novel RR-18 was identified and structurally confirmed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS). Subsequently, the myotropic activity of the synthetic replicate of 
RR-18 was investigated on the rat bladder, uterus, tail artery and ileum smooth 
muscle. The peptide was named RR-18 in accordance (R = N-terminal arginine, R = 
C-terminal arginine, 18 = number of residues). In this study, the synthetic 
replicates of RR-18 showed no agonist/antagonism of BK-induced rat bladder and 
uterus smooth muscle contraction. However, it displayed an antagonism of 
bradykinin-induced rat ileum contraction and arterial smooth muscle relaxation. 
The EC50 values of BK for ileum and artery, were 214.7 nM and 18.3 nM, 
respectively. When the tissue was pretreated with the novel peptide, RR-18, at 
the maximally effective concentration of bradykinin (1 × 10-6 M), 
bradykinin-induced contraction of the ileum and relaxation of the arterial 
smooth muscle was reduced by 50-60% and 30-40%, respectively. In conclusion, 
RR-18 represents novel bradykinin antagonising peptide from amphibian skin 
secretions. It may provide new insight into possible treatment options for 
chronic pain and chronic inflammation.

BACKGROUND: The management of Branch-Duct Intraductal Papillary Mucinous 
Neoplasm (BD-IPMN) is still controversial. Our objective was to assess the 
long-term follow-up (FU) of patients with "low-risk" BD-IPMN according to the 
Sendai-International Consensus Guidelines (ICG-I).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with BD-IPMN and 
Negative Sendai-Criteria (NSC) from January 2004 to October 2019. A univariate 
analysis was performed to determine factors associated with conversion to 
Positive Sendai-Criteria (PSC) and malignancy. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 
and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the IGC-I were assessed for the 
development of malignancy.
RESULTS: A total of 219 patients were selected and underwent a median 58-month 
FU. Thirty-seven (17%) patients developed PSC during FU including 12 (5.5%) with 
malignant lesions. Conversely, 182 patients (83%) did not develop malignancy. 
The NPV and PPV of ICG-I for malignancy were 100% and 32.4%, respectively. Among 
patients who developed PSC, those with cancer were >65years (OR = 3.57;p = 
0.015) and had significantly higher serum CA-19-9 levels (OR = 5.27;p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: The ICG-I is a safe strategy for FU of patients with BD-IPMN. The 
absence of PSC exclude malignancy. Among patients who develops PSC, the risk of 
cancer remains low and surgery should be decided according to their surgical 
risk and life expectancy.

The increasing access and efficacy of antiretroviral therapy has allowed people 
living with human immunodeficiency virus to achieve a life expectancy similar to 
that of the general population. However, this goal may be affected by the 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease in this group. This risk is 
multifactorial, involving the high prevalence of traditional risk factors, the 
development of a pro-inflammatory state related to chronic infection, and the 
use of antiretroviral drugs with an adverse metabolic profile. In daily 
practice, in order to estimate this risk and guide medical decision-making, 
different calculators are available. These are based on data from population 
cohorts, many of them from human immunodeficiency virusnegative subjects. The 
main aim of this review is to describe the epidemiology of cardiovascular 
disease in people living with human immunodeficiency virus, the available risk 
calculators and their use.

INTRODUCTION: There is a significant life expectancy gap attributable to 
physical comorbidities for people living with severe and persistent mental 
illness (SPMI) compared with the general population. Medications are a major 
treatment for SPMI management and physical illnesses, hence pharmacists are well 
positioned to support mental healthcare and comorbidities. The randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) aim is to evaluate effectiveness of an individualised, 
pharmacist led, support service for people experiencing SPMI focusing on 
medication adherence and physical comorbidity management, compared with standard 
care (a medication-management service; MedsCheck). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
PharMIbridge is a cluster RCT, whereby community pharmacies in four Australian 
regions will be randomised (1:1 ratio), to either Intervention Group (IG) or 
Comparator Group (CG). All IG and CG pharmacy staff will receive Blended-Mental 
Health First Aid training. Additionally, IG pharmacists will receive further 
training on medication adherence, goal setting, motivational interviewing, 
managing physical health concerns and complex issues relating to psychotropic 
medication. CG pharmacists will not receive additional training, and will 
provide standard care (MedsCheck). The primary outcome will be change in 
participants medication adherence for psychotropic medication over 6-months. 
Using mixed-effects logistic regression model and a cluster size of 48 
pharmacies, a total of 190 participants will need to be recruited to each arm to 
find a statistically significant difference in medication adherence. Secondary 
outcomes will be changes in factors associated with cardiometabolic risk and 
quality of life, emphasising physical and psychological well-being; 
medication-related problems; adherence to other prescribed medication; 
pharmacists knowledge, confidence and ability to support people experiencing 
SPMI; and effects on healthcare utilisation. A within RCT-based economic 
evaluation comparing the intervention with standard care will be undertaken.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol and pharmacist training programme 
received Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee approval 
(HREC/2019/473 and HREC/2019/493 respectively). Results will be published in 
peer-reviewed journals and available at the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement 
website (http://6cpa.com.au/about-6cpa/).

INTRODUCTION: Individuals living with spinal cord injury and disease (SCI/D) 
experience sensory and motor impairments below their neurological level of 
injury. Activity-based therapies (ABT) are interventions that provide activation 
of the neuromuscular system below the level of lesion with the goal of 
retraining the nervous system to recover a specific motor task. ABT can lead to 
increased function and improved quality of life; however, research and clinical 
settings currently lack tools to track participation in ABT. As a first step 
towards developing such a tool, a scoping review will be conducted with the 
objective of identifying the characteristics of ABT that individuals with SCI/D 
participate in across the continuum of care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping 
review framework. Studies that involve at least two sessions of ABT for 
individuals with SCI/D aged ≥16 years will be included. Seven databases were 
searched from their inception to 4 March 2020: Medline, Embase, Emcare, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, APA PsycINFO, 
Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search will be rerun in 
November 2020 prior to manuscript submission. Screening of titles and abstracts 
will be followed by a review of full texts to identify articles meeting 
inclusion criteria. Stakeholders will be consulted for the creation of the data 
extraction table. The Downs and Black Checklist or the Mixed Methods Appraisal 
Tool will be used to assess article quality. Results will be reported according 
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this scoping 
review. Study findings will be shared with key stakeholder groups through 
academic, clinical and public venues.

Obesity is a chronic disease that negatively affects life expectancy through its 
association with life-threatening diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular 
diseases. Expression proteomics combined with in silico interaction studies are 
used to uncover potential biomarkers and the pathways that promote 
obesity-related complications. These biomarkers can either aid in the 
development of personalized therapies or identify individuals at risk of 
developing obesity-related diseases. To determine the serum protein changes, 
Wistar rats were fed standard chow (low fat, LF), or chow formulated high fat 
(HF) diets (HF1, HF2 and HF3) for 8 and 42 weeks to induce obesity. Serum 
samples were collected from lean and obese rats at these time points. The serum 
samples were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone and analyzed 
by 2-Dimensional SDS-PAGE. Serum protein profiles were examined using mass 
spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and validated by western blotting. 
Protein-protein interactions among the selected proteins were studied in silico 
using bioinformatics tools. Several proteins showed differences in expression 
among the three HF diets when compared to the LF diet, and only proteins 
with ≥ twofold expression levels were considered differentially expressed. 
Apolipoprotein-AIV (APOA4), C-reactive protein (CRP), and alpha 2-HS 
glycoprotein (AHSG) showed differential expression at both 8 and 42 weeks, 
whereas alpha 1 macroglobulin (AMBP) was differentially expressed only at 
8 weeks. Network analysis revealed some interactions among the proteins, an 
indication that these proteins might interactively play a crucial role in 
development of obesity-induced diseases. These data show the variation in the 
expression of serum proteins during acute and chronic exposure to high fat diet. 
Based on the expression and the in-silico interaction these proteins warrant 
further investigation for their role in obesity development.

OBJECTIVE: The Beta-Blocker Evaluation Survival Trial showed no survival benefit 
for bucindolol in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure 
(HF) with reduced ejection fraction, but subanalyses suggested survival benefits 
for non-Black subjects and Arg389 homozygotes. We conducted an ex ante economic 
evaluation of Arg389 targeted treatment with bucindolol versus carvidolol, 
complementing a previous ex ante economic evaluation of bucindolol preceded by 
genetic testing for the Arg389 polymorphism, in which genetic testing prevailed 
economically over no testing.
METHODS: A decision tree analysis with an 18-month time horizon was performed to 
estimate the cost effectiveness/cost utility of trajectories of 100%, 50%, and 
0% of patients genetically tested for Arg389 and comparing bucindolol with 
empirical carvedilol treatment as per prior BEST subanalyses. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness/cost-utility ratios (ICERs/ICURs) were estimated.
RESULTS: Race-based analyses for non-White subjects at 100% testing showed a 
loss of (0.04) life-years and (0.03) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an 
incremental cost of $2185, yielding a negative ICER of ($54,625)/life-year and 
ICUR of ($72,833)/QALY lost; at 50%, the analyses showed a loss of (0.27) 
life-years and (0.16) QALYs at an incremental cost of $1843, yielding a negative 
ICER of ($6826)/life-year and ICUR of ($11,519)/QALY lost; at 0%, the analyses 
showed a loss of (0.33) life-years and (0.30) QALYs at an incremental cost of 
$1459, yielding a negative ICER of ($4421)/life-year and ICUR of ($4863)/QALY 
lost. Arg389 homozygote analyses at 100% testing showed incremental gains of 
0.02 life-years and 0.02 QALYs at an incremental cost of $378, yielding an ICER 
of 18,900/life-year and ICUR of $18,900/QALY gained; at 50%, the analyses showed 
a loss of (0.24) life-years and (0.09) QALYs at an incremental cost of $1039, 
yielding a negative ICER of ($4329)/life-year and ICUR of ($9336)/QALY lost; at 
0%, the analyses showed a loss of (0.33) life-years and (0.30) QALYs at an 
incremental cost of $1459, yielding a negative ICER of ($4421)/life-year and 
ICUR of ($4863)/QALY lost.
CONCLUSION: This independent ex ante economic evaluation suggests that 
genetically targeted treatment with bucindolol is unlikely to yield 
clinicoeconomic benefits over empirical treatment with carvedilol in NYHA III/IV 
HF.

Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate trends over time in age- and cause of death in males with 
haemophilia (PWH) in Norway compared with the general male population and 
investigate its correlates with improvements in haemophilia treatment.
METHODS: Data about age and cause of death in the period of 1986-2018, from two 
independent, high-quality national registries: the Norwegian Cause of Death 
Registry (NCoDR) and the patient registry at Centre for Rare Disorders (CRD), 
Oslo University Hospital.
RESULTS: Life expectancy increased significantly from 1986 to 2018. However, PWH 
still had a decreased mean age at death of 56.8 years (SD = 24.7) in the NCoDR 
and 58.6 years (SD = 21.7) in the CRD data, compared with 73.9 years (SD = 16.3) 
in the general male population. There was a distinct shift in the most 
frequently reported haemophilia-related causes of death, such as haemorrhage and 
AIDS, to more age-related causes of death, such as cancer, reflecting an ageing 
population.
CONCLUSION: Haemophilia treatment has improved significantly in the last three 
decades. Despite treatment-related improvements, PWH in Norway still have a 
decreased life expectancy compared with the general male population.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that blood pressure variability (BPV) may 
contribute to target organ damage, causing coronary heart disease, stroke, and 
renal disease independent of the level of blood pressure (BP). Several lines of 
evidence have also linked increased BPV to a higher risk of cognitive decline 
and incident dementia. The estimated number of dementia cases worldwide is 
nearly 50 million, and this number continues to grow with increasing life 
expectancy. Because there is no effective treatment to modify the course of 
dementia, targeting modifiable vascular factors continues as a top priority for 
dementia prevention. A clear understanding of the role of BPV in dementia may 
shed light on the etiology, early prevention, and novel therapeutic targets of 
dementia, and has therefore gained substantial attention from researchers and 
clinicians. This review summarizes state-of-art evidence on the relationship 
between BPV and dementia, with a specific focus on the epidemiological evidence, 
the underlying mechanisms, and potential intervention strategies. We also 
discuss challenges and opportunities for future research to facilitate optimal 
BP management and the clinical translation of BPV for the risk assessment and 
prevention of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Mental health and well-being among older women is an important topic 
due to the feminization of later life as women tend to have longer life 
expectancy resulting in elderly women being more advanced in age and 
outnumbering men. Older women generally play a key role in their families 
lifelong and mostly depend on social support from their family and close friends 
in older age to cope with any limitations they face as a result of age-related 
changes in their health and functional ability.
METHODS: We examine which factors predict mental health and well-being in older 
women using the Third Wave of the 2010 Female Social Status Survey conducted by 
the All-China Women's Federation (n = 3527). Applying the Andersen Model, 
regression analysis exploring predisposing, enabling and health need variables 
were tested using SPSS version 22 predicting a mental health scale.
RESULTS: Results showed that living with a spouse was not a significant 
predictor of mental health for women, while it was for men (b = - 1.2, p < .01), 
ownership of property is significant only for men (b = -.96, p < .05), whereas 
women's mental health is more strongly predicted by current exercise (b = -.89, 
p < .01) and participation in leisure activities (b = -.69, p < .001). Close 
relationships with neighbors, qualifying for old-age benefit programs and being 
in better overall health supports positive mental health for both men and women. 
Reporting delayed medical treatment is associated with a negative impact on 
mental health for men, but oddly women who report the same actually report 
better mental health, perhaps suggesting older women take pride in their 
self-sacrifice.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that gender differences in 
wealth, living alone, and social participation are interpreted differently by 
women, who have longer lives with generally fewer material resources. Enabling 
factors tend to be more associated with financial factors for men, while women 
rely on a social convoy to thrive longer than their male counterparts.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with reduced muscular 
strength resulting in profound fatigue. The physiopathology of these changes, 
their prevalence and evolution are still debated. Moreover, we have little data 
on elderly CKD patients. The present study protocol aims to 1) quantify the 
prevalence of low muscle strength (dynapenia) in a cohort of elderly patients 
with advanced CKD and to 2) characterize their force production coupled with 
electromyographic features and the symptoms of fatigue compared to a matched 
control group.
METHODS: This is a case-control, prospective, interventional study.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: age ≥ 60 years; CKD Stage 3b-5; clinical stability (i.e. no 
hospitalization and ≤ 25% in creatinine increase in the previous 3 months). 
Controls with normal kidney function will be matched in terms of age, gender and 
diabetes mellitus (requisite: estimated glomerular filtration 
rate ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 available in the last 6 months). Exclusion criteria for 
cases and controls: neuromuscular disease, life expectancy < 3 months. The 
handgrip strength protocol is an intermittent test consisting in 6 series of 9 
repetitions of 3-s sub-maximum contractions at 40% of the maximum voluntary 
contraction (MVC) and 2 s of resting time between contractions. Each series is 
separated by one fast sub-maximum contraction and one MVC. Strength is assessed 
with a high-frequency handgrip dynamometer paired with surface electromyography. 
Symptoms of fatigue are assessed using MFI-20 and FACIT-F questionnaires. In 
order to reach a statistical power of 96%, we plan to enroll 110 subjects in 
each group.
DISCUSSION: The novelty of this study resides in the application of an already 
validated set of tests in a population in which this combination (dynamometer, 
electromyography and questionnaires) has not previously been explored. We expect 
a high prevalence of dynapenia and a higher fatigability in CKD patients. A 
positive correlation is expected between reported fatigue and fatigability. 
Better appreciation of the prevalence and the relationship between fatigability 
and a sensation of fatigue can help us target interventions in CKD patients to 
improve quality of life and survival.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by Ethical Committee EST III 
n°20.03.01 and was recorded as a Clinical Trial (NCT04330807) on April 2, 2020.
