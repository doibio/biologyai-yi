regional and local patterns of these two MSDs seems inevitable for better 
policy-making. The current study presents updated results of the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 and reports the burden of RA and LBP in North Africa 
and Middle East (NAME) countries from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years 
lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and risk 
factors, including high body mass index, occupational ergonomic factors, and 
smoking, were extracted based on the GBD 2019 data.
RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence and mortality of RA were 120.6 (95% 
uncertainty interval [95% UI] 107.0-135.7) and 0.1 (95% UI 0.1-0.2) per 100 000 
population in 2019 with 28.3% (95% UI 25.5%-30.9%) increase and 7.5% (95% UI 
-37.5% to 32.5%) decrease since 1990, respectively. Turkey had the highest 
age-standardized incidence, prevalence, and DALYs of RA in 2019. All RA burden 
measures were higher for women; however, the incidence was almost the same at 
ages greater than 65 years. The age-standardized prevalence and DALYs of LBP 
were 7668.2 (95% UI 6798.0-8636.3) and 862 (95% UI 605.5-1153.3) in 2019, which 
had decreased by 5.8% (95% UI -7.4% to -4.3%) and 6.0% (95% UI -7.7% to -4.2%) 
since 1990, respectively. Moreover, although Turkey had the highest incidence 
and prevalence in 1990, Iran was at the top in 2019. The regional 
age-standardized DALY rates due to RA and LBP attributed to smoking were 1.7 
(95% UI 0.5-3.2) and 139.4 (95% UI 87.3-198.8) in 2019, respectively, which had 
decreased 2.2% (95% UI -19.2% to 13.7%) and 15.4% (95% UI -19.4% to -10.5%) 
since 1990, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RA still imposes a significant burden in the NAME region as the 
burden measures have increased from 1990 to 2019. On the other hand, regarding 
LBP, a decreasing pattern was observed. Differences among the countries and 
between ages and genders can have implications, and the results of this study 
may be helpful for policy-makers in the NAME countries.

Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. The likelihood 
of developing a neurodegenerative disease rises dramatically as life expectancy 
increases. Although it has drawn significant attention, there is still a lack of 
proper effective treatments for neurodegenerative disease because the mechanisms 
of its development and progression are largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles 
(EVs) are small bi-lipid layer-enclosed nanosized particles in tissues and 
biological fluids. EVs are emerging as novel intercellular messengers and 
regulate a series of biological responses. Increasing evidence suggests that EVs 
are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, 
we summarize the recent findings of EVs in neurodegenerative diseases and bring 
up the limitations in the field.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs, primarily 
the lungs and digestive system. Over the years, advancements in medical care and 
treatments have significantly increased the life expectancy of individuals with 
CF. However, with this improved longevity, concerns about the potential risk of 
developing certain types of cancers have arisen. This narrative review aims to 
explore the relationship between CF, increased life expectancy, and the 
associated risk for cancers. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying this 
risk, including chronic inflammation, immune system dysregulation, and genetic 
factors. Additionally, we review studies that have examined the incidence and 
types of cancers seen in CF patients, with a focus on gastrointestinal, breast, 
and respiratory malignancies. We also explore the impact of CFTR modulator 
therapies on cancer risk. In the gastrointestinal tract, CF patients have an 
elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and possibly 
esophageal cancer. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these increased 
risks are not fully understood, but chronic inflammation, altered gut 
microbiota, and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Regular 
surveillance and colonoscopies are recommended for early detection and 
management of colorectal cancer in CF patients. Understanding the factors 
contributing to cancer development in CF patients is crucial for implementing 
appropriate surveillance strategies and improving long-term outcomes. Further 
research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved and develop 
targeted interventions to mitigate cancer risk in individuals with CF.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by 
the appearance of painful inflamed nodules, abscesses, and pus-draining sinus 
tracts in the intertriginous skin of the groins, buttocks, and perianal and 
axillary regions. Despite its high prevalence of ~0.4-1%, therapeutic options 
for HS are still limited. Over the past 10 years, it has become clear that HS is 
a systemic disease, associated with various comorbidities, including metabolic 
syndrome (MetS) and its sequelae. Accordingly, the life expectancy of HS 
patients is significantly reduced. MetS, in particular, obesity, can support 
sustained inflammation and thereby exacerbate skin manifestations and the 
chronification of HS. However, MetS actually lacks necessary attention in HS 
therapy, underlining the high medical need for novel therapeutic options. This 
review directs attention towards the relevance of MetS in HS and evaluates the 
potential of phytomedical drug candidates to alleviate its components. It starts 
by describing key facts about HS, the specifics of metabolic alterations in HS 
patients, and mechanisms by which obesity may exacerbate HS skin alterations. 
Then, the results from the preclinical studies with phytochemicals on MetS 
parameters are evaluated and the outcomes of respective randomized controlled 
clinical trials in healthy people and patients without HS are presented.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are excited or partially reduced forms of 
atmospheric oxygen, which are continuously produced during aerobic metabolism 
like many physiochemical processes operating throughout seed life. Previously, 
it was believed that ROS are merely cytotoxic molecules, however, now it has 
been established that they perform numerous beneficial functions in plants 
including many critical roles in seed physiology. ROS facilitate seed 
germination via cell wall loosening, endosperm weakening, signaling, and 
decreasing abscisic acid (ABA) levels. Most of the existing knowledge about ROS 
homeostasis and functions is based on the seeds of common plants or model ones. 
There is little information about the role of ROS in the germination process of 
halophyte seeds. There are several definitions for halophytic plants, however, 
we believed "halophytes are plants that can grow in very saline environment and 
complete their life cycle by adopting various phenological, morphological and 
physiological mechanisms at canopy, plant, organelle and molecular scales". 
Furthermore, mechanisms underlying ROS functions such as downstream targets, 
cross-talk with other molecules, and alternative routes are still obscure. The 
primary objective of this review is to decipher the mechanisms of ROS 
homeostasis in halophytes and dry seeds, as well as ROS flux in germinating 
seeds of halophytes.

Undoubtedly, the advent of antibiotics in the 19th century had a substantial 
impact, increasing human life expectancy. However, a multitude of scientific 
investigations now indicate that we are currently experiencing a phase known as 
the post-antibiotic era. There is a genuine concern that we might regress to a 
time before antibiotics and confront widespread outbreaks of severe epidemic 
diseases, particularly those caused by bacterial infections. These 
investigations have demonstrated that epidemics thrive under environmental 
stressors such as climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and 
detrimental human activities such as wars, conflicts, antibiotic overuse, and 
pollution. Moreover, bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt and mutate. 
Unfortunately, the current development of antibiotics is insufficient, and the 
future appears grim unless we abandon our current approach of generating 
synthetic antibiotics that rapidly lose their effectiveness against 
multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite their vital role in modern medicine, 
medicinal plants have served as the primary source of curative drugs since 
ancient times. Numerous scientific reports published over the past three decades 
suggest that medicinal plants could serve as a promising alternative to 
ineffective antibiotics in combating infectious diseases. Over the past few 
years, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, saponins, and terpenoids have exhibited 
noteworthy antibacterial potential, primarily through membrane-disruption 
mechanisms, protein binding, interference with intermediary metabolism, 
anti-quorum sensing, and anti-biofilm activity. However, to optimize their 
utilization as effective antibacterial drugs, further advancements in omics 
technologies and network pharmacology will be required in order to identify 
optimal combinations among these compounds or in conjunction with antibiotics.

Human Factors Considerations for Quantifiable Human States in Physical 
Human-Robot Interaction: A Literature Review.

As the global population rapidly ages with longer life expectancy and declining 
birth rates, the need for healthcare services and caregivers for older adults is 
increasing. Current research envisions addressing this shortage by introducing 
domestic service robots to assist with daily activities. The successful 
integration of robots as domestic service providers in our lives requires them 
to possess efficient manipulation capabilities, provide effective physical 
assistance, and have adaptive control frameworks that enable them to develop 
social understanding during human-robot interaction. In this context, human 
factors, especially quantifiable ones, represent a necessary component. The 
objective of this paper is to conduct an unbiased review encompassing the 
studies on human factors studied in research involving physical interactions and 
strong manipulation capabilities. We identified the prevalent human factors in 
physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), noted the factors typically addressed 
together, and determined the frequently utilized assessment approaches. 
Additionally, we gathered and categorized proposed quantification approaches 
based on the measurable data for each human factor. We also formed a map of the 
common contexts and applications addressed in pHRI for a comprehensive 
understanding and easier navigation of the field. We found out that most of the 
studies in direct pHRI (when there is direct physical contact) focus on social 
behaviors with belief being the most commonly addressed human factor type. Task 
collaboration is moderately investigated, while physical assistance is rarely 
studied. In contrast, indirect pHRI studies (when the physical contact is 
mediated via a third item) often involve industrial settings, with physical 
ergonomics being the most frequently investigated human factor. More research is 
needed on the human factors in direct and indirect physical assistance 
applications, including studies that combine physical social behaviors with 
physical assistance tasks. We also found that while the predominant approach in 
most studies involves the use of questionnaires as the main method of 
quantification, there is a recent trend that seeks to address the quantification 
approaches based on measurable data.

BACKGROUND: The extension of average life expectancy and the aggravation of 
population aging have become the inevitable trend of human development. In an 
aging society, various problems related to medical care for the elderly have 
become increasingly prominent. However, most of the age-related diseases have 
the characteristics of multiple diseases at the same time, prone to 
complications, and atypical clinical manifestations, which bring great 
difficulties to its treatment. Galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a natural 
active compound extracted from the root of Alpinia officinarum Hance 
(Zingiberaceae). Recently, many studies have shown that galangin has potential 
advantages in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases, which are common in the elderly. In addition, it also 
showed that galangin had prospective activities in the treatment of tumor, 
diabetes, liver injury, asthma and arthritis.
PURPOSE: This review aims to systematically summarize and discuss the effects 
and the underlying mechanism of galangin in the treatment of age-related 
diseases.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, SciFinder, Web of Science and CNKI literature 
database resources, combined with the keywords "galangin", "neurodegenerative 
disease", "tumor", "diabetes", "pharmacological activity", "drug combination", 
"pharmacokinetics", "drug delivery system" and "safety", and comprehensively 
reviewed the pharmacological activities and mechanism of galangin in treating 
age-related diseases.
RESULTS: According to the previous studies on galangin, the 
anti-neurodegenerative activity, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular protective 
activity, anti-tumor activity, anti-diabetes activity, anti-arthritis activity, 
hepatoprotective activity and antiasthmatic activity of galangin were discussed, 
and the related mechanisms were classified and summarized in detail. In 
addition, the drug combination, pharmacokinetics, drug delivery system and 
safety of galangin were furtherly discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: This review will provide reference for galangin in the treatment of 
age-related diseases. Meanwhile, further experimental research and long-term 
clinical trials are needed to determine the therapeutic safety and efficacy of 
galangin.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the relationship between programmed 
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
expression in colon adenocarcinoma tumor budding.
METHODS: This study included 122 patients with colon adenocarcinomas. The 
largest sample of formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was 
selected for analysis. Expression of membranous PD-L1 (clone 22C3) and the 
Combined Positive Score (CPS) in tumor tissues was calculated and graded 
according to the percentages of peritumoral and intratumoral tumor cells (0 %, 
1 %, 1-5 %, >5 %). The effects of these factors on the prognosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: Tumor budding was associated with adverse clinicopathological features 
and poor overall survival. PD-L1 (CPS%) peritumoral tumor budding (1 %/<1 %) was 
statistically significant in the univariate model (p = 0.004). Age, organ 
metastases (liver, lung, liver, lung, and peritoneum), and metastases were 
statistically significant in the multivariate model (p = 0.001, p = 0.004, 
p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.004, and p = 0.032, respectively). PD-L1 positive 
staining was mostly observed around the tumor and during tumor budding. PD-L1 
peritumoral tumor budding rates and patients' survival rates differed 
significantly (log-rank = 12.07, p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: We found that patients with PD-L1 (CPS%) > 1 % in tumor budding had 
a shortened life expectancy and demonstrated the importance of including tumor 
budding areas in the samples used for biomarker evaluation. We previously 
reported that PD-L1 expression in tumor budding is associated with more 
aggressive cancer biology and poor survival, although overall survival is of 
limited statistical significance.

In this study, monodispersed and quasi-spherical C-Dots with an average size of 
7.2 nm were successfully synthesized from sour whey solution by a hydrothermal 
method (200 °C for 9 h) for fiordilatte cheese packaging. C-Dots (2500 and 5000 
mgL-1) were added to the cheese through an alginate-based coating or directly to 
the cheese brine. No significant changes in TM4 cell viability were observed at 
concentrations lower than 10,000 mgL-1. Microbiological and sensory properties 
of cheese coated and uncoated with C-Dots indicate a substantial preserving 
effect of the C-Dots. The uncoated control fiordilatte exhibited unacceptable 
levels of microbial proliferation within 3.5 days. Conversely, the coated cheese 
remained within acceptable limits, effectively doubling its shelf life compared 
to the control, primarily due to the coating protection rather than the addition 
of C-Dots. When compared to the control fiordilatte, the addition of C-Dots in 
the brine at 5000 mgL-1 resulted in an extension of over 10 days in cheese shelf 
life. Considering the significance of the sustainable approach in C-Dots 
synthesis and the exceptional use of C-Dots in the food industry, these findings 
hold great potential in terms of research and industrial applications.

OBJECTIVE: Bulgarian government efforts to tackle obesity are focused mainly on 
guidelines affecting children. However, it is unclear whether targeting children 
for obesity-related health policies yields better long-term health outcomes as 
opposed to changing the risk of obesity in adulthood. This study aims to 
evaluate where policy efforts should be directed to alleviate the health burden 
associated with obesity.
METHODS: We compare the impact on population health of two simulated scenarios 
when (a) the prevalence of obesity upon entering adulthood is lowered; (b) the 
risk of getting an unhealthy weight as an adult is reduced. Additionally, we run 
(c) combinations of the two and (d) childhood obesity prevention on the one 
hand, and worsening (increasing) obesity incidence later in adulthood on the 
other.
RESULTS: Our findings show that obesogenic environmental changes throughout 
adulthood have a stronger effect on life expectancy (LE), diabetes-free life 
expectancy (DFLE) and type 2 diabetes prevalence outcomes compared to lowering 
the proportion of individuals with obesity during adolescence. Nevertheless, a 
sizable reduction in the number of young adults with unhealthy weight has the 
potential to recover years of LE/DFLE that would be lost if the risk of obesity 
in adulthood would continue to grow in time.
CONCLUSIONS: The two types of policies' (a-b) effects are not equivalent in 
strength and the best way forward is dependent on future obesity incidence 
trends.

Over the years, South Africa has made significant investments aimed at 
transforming the agricultural sector to deliver on rural economic development 
and job creation. These investments have had varying levels of success; still, 
what is worrying is the high youth unemployment rate which is amongst the 
highest globally. We conducted a scoping review using the PRISMA-P guidelines to 
identify the challenges youth face in accessing sustainable employment in the 
agriculture sector. Peer-reviewed studies were retrieved from online databases 
(Web of Science, Cab Direct, and Science Direct) for 1994-2021. The findings 
showed that youth are still facing significant challenges in the demand and 
supply side of the labour market and lack of inclusivity in policy formulation 
and implementation, limiting their involvement in agriculture and rural 
development initiatives. Policies and strategies responding to these challenges 
exist, and the spectrum of support services provided are primarily focused on 
entrepreneurship. Yet, the implementation of programs and initiatives has not 
been successful. This could be attributed to the obstacles persisting in the 
sociopolitical environment in SA, causing additional barriers to program 
implementation. Therefore, to enhance youth involvement in agriculture and rural 
development, there is a need to connect more rural youth to support services, 
local employment programmes, and youth inclusion in policy formulation 
processes. Additionally, the focus of policy and programs should be broadened to 
cater to different youth knowledge and skill profiles.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To date, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on life 
expectancy for the Asian American (AA) population has been reported in 
aggregate. This study provides estimates of life expectancy at birth before and 
during the pandemic, with a set of demographic, health, and socioeconomic risk 
factors for the four largest subgroups: Asian Indians, Chinese, Filipinos, and 
Vietnamese. These estimates are placed in context of the broader U.S. 
population.
METHODS: This study uses age-specific all-cause mortality from CDC WONDER and 
population counts from the American Community Surveys. We apply methodologies to 
address variability in population sizes over time (smoothing) and data quality 
issues at older ages (Brass relational model life table system) to produce three 
sets of sex-specific life expectancy estimates by subgroup for 2019, 2020, and 
2021.
RESULTS: Almost all estimates show that the four AA subgroups experienced 
greater losses between 2019 and 2020 than Whites. These losses ranged from 1.1 
to 3.9 years, with the largest drops among Chinese women (2.0-2.4) and Filipino 
men (3.5-3.9). Under all scenarios, losses in life expectancy were considerably 
smaller in 2021 than in 2020 among the four subgroups - with several subgroups 
experiencing a modest rebound - but these improvements did not compensate for 
the large increases in death rates in 2020. Filipino men had the largest decline 
in life expectancy from 2019 to 2021 among the four subgroups (3.4-4.2 years), 
and Vietnamese men and women experienced large losses which continued into the 
second year of the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high pre-pandemic life expectancies, AAs suffered a large, 
and rarely acknowledged, increase in mortality during the pandemic, with 
substantial heterogeneity across subgroups and between women and men. This 
variability is due in part to the pronounced differences in risk factors for 
infection and severity which have been documented within the AA population.

The importance of smallholder farming is increasingly recognized in rural areas 
where increased crop productivity and market participation can effectively 
improve their dietary diversity and nutrition quality. However, rural households 
are still faced with severe food insecurity and malnutrition. The study sought 
to assess the role of smallholder farming in crop productivity and market access 
on rural household dietary diversity. The secondary data were collected using a 
quantitative research method, and 1520 participants were selected using a 
stratified random sampling technique. The descriptive results showed that 
cereals were the most (98%) consumed food group, while vegetables and fruits 
were the least consumed food groups, at 37% and 23%, respectively. The results 
from the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) showed that 57% of smallholder 
farmers consumed highly diverse diets (more or equal to six food groups), 
whereas 25% and 18% of smallholder farmers consumed medium dietary diversity 
(four to five food groups) and low diverse diets (less or equal to three food 
groups), respectively. The findings from the Conditional Mixed Process (CMP) and 
Poisson endogenous treatment effect models showed that household size, ownership 
of livestock, wealth index, and involvement in crop production positively 
influenced household dietary diversity. On the other hand, output and access to 
market information showed a negative effect. Social grants had contradicting 
effects: they had a negative impact on the HDDS received from crop productivity 
while they had a positive effect on the HDDS from market participation. 
Providing different ways smallholder farmers can use their funds effectively can 
help improve household dietary diversity and nutrition quality. The study 
recommended that more workshops and training be conducted that cover all the 
sustainable production systems that smallholder farmers can undertake to produce 
different food groups. These will raise awareness among smallholder farmers 
about the requirements for balanced diets for food and nutrition security.

South Africa faces the triple burden of malnutrition, high poverty levels, 
unemployment, and inequality. "Wicked problems" such as these require innovative 
and transdisciplinary responses, multi-stakeholder coordination and 
collaboration, managing complex synergies and trade-offs, and achieving 
sustainable outcomes. Through qualitative content analysis of national and 
provincial sector-based policies, we explored the interlinkages between the 
agriculture, environment, and health sectors in South Africa in the context of 
sustainable food and nutrition security and the extent to which these 
interlinkages are integrated into policy and planning. A systemic analysis of 
the review outcomes was performed to identify its main learning outcome, the 
status quo in the policy process. The nature of feedback loops was identified, 
and a leverage point was suggested. The review highlighted that policymakers in 
the agriculture, environment and health sectors are aware of, and have 
understood, the relationships among the three sectors. They have also made 
attempts to address these interlinkages through collaboration and coordination. 
Unfortunately, this has been met with several challenges due to fragmented 
sector-specific mandates and targets and a lack of resources for integrated 
solutions. This creates implementation gaps and unintended duplication of 
activities, leading to poor service delivery. Transitioning to sustainable and 
healthy food systems will only be possible after these gaps have been closed and 
implementation optimization has been achieved. Focusing on meta-level 
problem-framing, functional collaboration through transdisciplinary approaches, 
and integrated targets are critical to successful policy implementation and 
progressive realization of national goals related to sustainable food and 
nutrition security, unemployment, poverty, and inequality.

The widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living 
with HIV (PLWH) has dramatically reduced mortality and improved life expectancy. 
However, even with suppression of HIV-1 replication, chronic immune activation 
and elevated inflammation persist. Chronic immune activation has been linked to 
a pro-inflammatory gut microbiome composition, exacerbated by compromised 
intestinal barrier integrity that occurs after HIV infection. Individuals living 
in urban versus rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa have differences in 
environmental factors such as water source or diet that may impact gut 
microbiome composition, yet immune phenotype and gut microbiome composition 
response to ART in PLWH living in rural versus urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa 
have not been compared. Here, we measured immune phenotypes and fecal microbiome 
composition in PLWH and healthy participants recruited from the urban Mabvuku 
polyclinic in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe and the Mutoko District hospital 
located in a district 146 km from Harare that services surrounding rural 
villages. PLWH were either ART naïve at baseline and sampled again after 24 
weeks of treatment with efavirenz/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(EFV/3TC/TDF) and the prophylactic antibiotic cotrimoxazole or were ART 
experienced at both timepoints. Although expected reductions in the inflammatory 
marker IL-6, T-cell activation, and exhaustion were observed in individuals who 
had suppressed HIV-1 with treatment, these changes were significant only when 
considering individuals in the urban and not the rural area. Gut microbiome 
composition showed more marked differences from healthy controls in the ART 
experienced compared to ART naïve cohort, and consistent longitudinal changes 
were also observed in ART naïve PLWH after 24 weeks of treatment, including a 
reduction in alpha diversity and altered composition. However, gut microbiome 
composition showed a more pronounced relationship with chronic immune activation 
and exhaustion phenotypes in the ART naïve compared to ART experienced PLWH, 
suggesting a particularly significant role for the gut microbiome in disease 
progression in uncontrolled infection.

INTRODUCTION: Interferon beta (IFN beta) preparations are an established group 
of drugs used for immunomodulation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Subcutaneously (sc) applied interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a sc) has been in 
continuous clinical use for 25 years as a disease-modifying treatment.
AREAS COVERED: Based on data published since 2018, we discuss recent insights 
from analyses of the pivotal trial PRISMS and its long-term extension as well as 
from newer randomized studies with IFN beta-1a sc as the reference treatment, 
the use of IFN beta-1a sc across the patient life span and as a bridging 
therapy, recent data regarding the mechanisms of action, and potential benefits 
of IFN beta-1a sc regarding vaccine responses.
EXPERT OPINION: IFN beta-1a sc paved the way to effective immunomodulatory 
treatment of MS, enabled meaningful insights into the disease process, and 
remains a valid therapeutic option in selected vulnerable MS patient groups.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is often misdiagnosed as Type I or 
II diabetes. This study was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of MODY 
screening strategies in Hungary, which included a recent genetic test compared 
with no routine screening for MODY. A simulation model that combined a decision 
tree and an individual-level Markov model was constructed to assess the costs 
per quality-adjusted life year of screening strategies. Stratifying patients 
based on age and insulin treatment followed by a risk assessment questionnaire, 
a laboratory test and genetic testing was the most cost-effective strategy, 
saving EUR 12 and generating 0.0047 quality-adjusted life years gained per 
screened patient. This screening strategy could be considered for reimbursement, 
especially in countries with limited resources.
