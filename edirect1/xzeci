INTERVENTIONS: Bedtimes were manipulated to be 1 hour later (sleep restriction) 
and 1 hour earlier (sleep extension) than usual for 1 week each. Wake times were 
unchanged.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcome measures were assessed during both 
intervention weeks. Sleep timing and duration were assessed using 7-night 
actigraphy. Children and parents rated the child's sleep disturbances (night) 
and impairment (day) using the 8-item Pediatric Sleep Disturbance and 8-item 
Sleep-Related Impairment scales of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System questionnaire. Child-reported HRQOL was assessed using the 
27-item KIDSCREEN questionnaire with 5 subscale scores and a total score. Both 
questionnaires assessed the past 7 days at the end of each intervention week. 
Data were presented as mean differences and 95% CIs between the sleep 
restriction and extension weeks and were analyzed using intention to treat and 
an a priori difference in sleep of at least 30 minutes per night.
RESULTS: The final sample comprised 100 children (52 girls [52%]; mean [SD] age, 
10.3 [1.4] years). During the sleep restriction week, children went to sleep 64 
(95% CI, 58-70) minutes later, and sleep offset (wake time) was 18 (95% CI, 
13-24) minutes later, meaning that children received 39 (95% CI, 32-46) minutes 
less of total sleep per night compared with the sleep extension week in which 
the total sleep time was 71 (95% CI, 64-78) minutes less in the per-protocol 
sample analysis. Both parents and children reported significantly less sleep 
disturbance at night but greater sleep impairment during the day with sleep 
restriction. Significant standardized reductions in physical well-being 
(standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.28; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.08), coping in a 
school environment (SMD, -0.26; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.09), and total HRQOL score 
(SMD, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.08) were reported by children during sleep 
restriction, with an additional reduction in social and peer support (SMD, 
-0.24; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.01) in the per-protocol sample analysis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this secondary analysis of the DREAM trial 
indicated that even 39 minutes less of sleep per night for 1 week significantly 
reduced several facets of HRQOL in children. This finding shows that ensuring 
children receive sufficient good-quality sleep is an important child health 
issue.

Over the past few decades, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has 
markedly improved due to the advances in HIV diagnosis, linkage to care, and 
treatment. However, with these advances, a new set of challenges has emerged 
that must be addressed to ensure the long-term well-being of people living with 
HIV. In this article, as part of a wider journal supplement, we explore the 
unmet needs and challenges across the HIV continuum of care and re-define what 
long-term success looks like to support the healthy ageing of all people 
affected by HIV.

OBJECTIVES: In recent decades, the needs of people living with HIV have evolved 
as life expectancy has greatly improved. Now, a new definition of long-term 
success (LTS) is necessary to help address the multifaceted needs of all people 
living with HIV.
METHODS: We conducted a two-phase research programme to delineate the range of 
experiences of people living with HIV. The insights garnered from these research 
phases were explored in a series of expert-led workshops, which led to the 
development and refinement of the LTS framework.
RESULTS: The insights generated from the research phases identified a series of 
themes that form a part of LTS. These themes were subsequently incorporated into 
the LTS framework, which includes five outcome pillars: sustained undetectable 
viral load, minimal impact of treatment and clinical monitoring, optimized 
health-related quality of life, lifelong integration of healthcare, and freedom 
from stigma and discrimination. A series of supporting statements were also 
developed by the expert panel to help in the achievement of each of the LTS 
pillars.
CONCLUSIONS: The LTS framework offers a comprehensive and person-centric 
approach that, if achieved, could help improve the long-term well-being of 
people living with HIV and support the LTS vision of 'every person living with 
HIV being able to live their best life'.

The global population is getting older due to a combination of longer life 
expectancy and declining birth rates. Growing evidence suggests that the oral 
microbiota composition and distribution may have a profound effect on how well 
we age. The purpose of this study was to investigate age-related oral microbiome 
variations of supragingival plaque and buccal mucosa samples in the general 
population in Latvia. Our results indicated significant difference between 
supragingival plaque bacterial profiles of three age groups (20-40; 40-60; 
60 + years). Within supragingival plaque samples, age group 20-40 showed the 
highest bacterial diversity with a decline during the 40-60 age period and 
uprise again after the age of 60. Among other differences, the important oral 
commensal Neisseria had declined after the age of 40. Additionally, prevalence 
of two well-documented opportunistic pathogens Streptococcus anginosus and 
Gemella sanguinis gradually rose with age within our samples. Furthermore, 
supragingival plaque and buccal mucosa samples significantly differed in overall 
bacterial composition.

The projected increase in life expectancy over the next few decades is expected 
to result in a rise in age-related diseases, including cancer. Head and neck 
cancer (HNC) is a worldwide health problem with high rates of morbidity and 
mortality. In this report, we have critically reviewed the literature reporting 
the management of older patients with HNC. Older adults are more prone to 
complications and toxicities secondary to HNC treatment, especially those 
patients who are frail or have comorbidities. Thus, this population should be 
screened prior to treatment for such predispositions to maximize medical 
management of comorbidities. Chronologic age itself is not a reason for choosing 
less intensive treatment for older HNC patients. Whenever possible, also older 
patients should be treated according to the best standard of care, as 
nonstandard approaches may result in increased treatment failure rates and 
mortality. The treatment plan is best established by a multidisciplinary tumor 
board with shared decision-making with patients and family. Treatment 
modifications should be considered for those patients who have severe 
comorbidities, evidence of frailty (low performance status), or low performance 
status or those who refuse the recommendations of the tumor board.

Female homicide is a global phenomenon with a higher prevalence in countries in 
Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Life expectancy in Brazil is compromised by the 
high risk of death from male and female homicides, a growing social problem. 
This study aimed to integrate different public datasets and describe the 
sociodemographic, criminal, and medicolegal characteristics of the homicides of 
girls and women occurring in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, from 2010 to 2016. 
The data were obtained from autopsy reports, police reports, and records from 
crime scenes. During this period, there was a significant increase in overall 
standardized rates of female homicides (4.98 to 10.85), with a pronounced 
increase in non-gender-related deaths, especially due to urban violence, such as 
involvement in drug trafficking and other crimes and robbery resulting in death. 
Young (15-29 years of age), non-White women were the most affected. Increased 
female homicide rates due to non-gender-related factors is a new and worrying 
phenomenon in Brazil. Obtaining specific data on the profile of victims and 
characteristics of violence is a crucial step in facing the problem and 
directing public policies.

Substantial evidence suggests that access to urban green spaces and parks is 
associated with positive health outcomes, including decreased mortality. Few 
existing studies have investigated the association between green spaces and life 
expectancy (LE), and none have used small-area data in the U.S. Here we used the 
recently released U.S. Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project data to 
quantify the relationship between LE and green space in Los Angeles County, a 
large diverse region with inequities in park access. We developed a model to 
quantify the association between green space and LE at the census tract level. 
We evaluated three green space metrics: normalized difference vegetation index 
(NDVI, 0.6-meter scale), percent tree canopy cover, and accessible park acres. 
We statistically adjusted for 15 other determinants of LE. We also developed 
conditional autoregressive models to account for spatial dependence. Tree canopy 
and NDVI were both significantly associated with higher LE. For an interquartile 
range (IQR) increase in each metric respectively, the spatial models 
demonstrated a 0.24 to 0.33-year increase in LE. Tree canopy and NDVI also 
modified the effect of park acreage on LE. ln areas with tree canopy levels 
below the county median, an IQR increase in park acreage was associated with an 
increase of 0.12 years. Although on an individual level these effects were 
modest, we predicted 155,300 years of LE gains across the population in LA 
County if all areas below median tree canopy were brought to the county median 
of park acres. If tree canopy or NDVI were brought to median levels, between 
570,300 and 908,800 years of LE could be gained. The majority of potential gains 
are in areas with predominantly Hispanic/Latinx and Black populations. These 
findings suggest that equitable access to green spaces could result in 
substantial population health benefits.

BACKGROUND: In many fields of medicine, guidelines recommend reduced cancer 
screening in patients of advanced age with limited life expectancy (LLE). In 
dermatology, there are currently no guidelines for adjusted evaluation and 
management practices of keratinocyte cancer (KC) in patients with LLE. Little is 
known regarding evaluation and management patterns and frequency of biopsies in 
these patients.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if dermatology providers biopsy LLE patients 
with similar frequency to their age-matched peers and quantify frequency of 
associated complications.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of evaluations for skin cancer 
quantified by skin biopsy frequency at the North Texas Veterans Affairs Health 
System dermatology clinic for 3,062 patients between 2005 and 2009, including a 
5-year follow-up period. Life expectancy was quantified by the validated 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) with a Deyo adaptation.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in biopsy frequency of KC in LLE 
versus non-LLE patients in most age-controlled groups, with increased biopsy 
frequency in LLE patients in the 65-74 age category (p = 0.02). There was also 
an increased risk of complications from biopsy in the 75-84 (many comorbidities 
subgroup: RR = 3.27, p = 0.002; some comorbidities subgroup: RR = 2.26, p = 
0.048) and 65-74 (many comorbidities subgroup: RR = 1.52, p = 0.004) age groups 
when compared to age-matched healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: Biopsy frequency is similar or increased in patients with LLE 
compared with age-matched controls, with increased frequency of complications. 
Further studies are needed to understand the underlying factors driving these 
practice patterns.

KEY POINTS: Limited data exist to inform younger persons with CKD how their risk 
for mortality compares with equivalently aged individuals without CKD. Compared 
with the general population without CKD, the age-stratified risk for mortality 
was highest in younger individuals with CKD. From a lifetime perspective, the 
estimated reduction of lifespan secondary to CKD was greatest at younger ages.
BACKGROUND: Younger individuals living with CKD face a lifetime at risk for 
complications and mortality. Limited data exist to inform individual patients 
with CKD across the lifespan how their risk for mortality compares with 
equivalently aged individuals without CKD, particularly at younger ages. The 
objective of this study was to provide age-specific contexts to the risk of 
mortality associated with a diagnosis of CKD.
METHODS: We created a pooled study cohort using participants with CKD enrolled 
in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort along with participants aged 21–75 
years included in the 1999–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
surveys. Age-stratified mortality rates, along with unadjusted and adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality, were generated to compare differences between 
those with and without CKD. The mean life-years lost (LYL) relating to CKD was 
calculated using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention life tables.
RESULTS: A total of 16,725 participants were included. Mortality rates were 
higher in those with CKD at all ages. The adjusted age-stratified HR for 
mortality in those with CKD versus without was highest in the 21–35 years strata 
(HR [95% confidence interval (CI)], 4.9 [2.8 to 8.6])) and lowest in the 65–75 
years strata (HR [95% CI], 2.0 [1.7 to 2.3]). The mean LYL secondary to CKD was 
inversely related with increasing age.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with age-matched peers without CKD, the age-stratified 
risk for mortality and LYL associated with a diagnosis of CKD is highest in 
younger individuals. Further research is needed to elucidate the societal and 
personal costs of premature mortality associated with CKD in young adults.

BACKGROUND: Kidney dysfunction is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and 
chronic kidney disease. Herein, we aimed to describe the attributable burden of 
kidney dysfunction at the national and sub-national levels in Iran.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data were extracted on the 
deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost, and years 
lived with disability attributed to the risk factor of kidney dysfunction by age 
and sex at the national and provincial levels from 1990-2019. Also, risk 
exposure was reported by summary exposure value (SEV) with a range of 0 to 100. 
The estimated values were based on a comparative risk assessment framework.
RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardized death rate and age-standardized DALYs 
rate attributable to kidney dysfunction were 58.2 (95% uncertainty interval of 
48.8-68.1) and 1127.2 (981.1-1282.7) per 100,000 population in Iran, 
respectively. Also, the Sistan and Baluchistan province (1729.3 [1478.3-2006.4]) 
and the province of Tehran (681.9 [571.4-809.8]) had the greatest and lowest 
age-standardized DALYs rates, respectively. Nationally, SEVs increased from 22.8 
to 26.2. The age-standardized burden attributable to kidney dysfunction had a 
positive association with age advancement. The attributable age-standardized 
deaths and DALYs rates in all socio-demographic index regions decreased from 
1990-2019. Also, the highest and lowest attributable age-standardized DALYs 
rates of kidney dysfunction came from ischemic heart disease and peripheral 
artery disease in 2019, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although the attributed age-standardized DALYs and death rates 
decreased from 1990-2019, risk exposure increased and remains a crucial risk 
factor in Iran. Therefore, policymakers should consider preparing a preventive 
program that takes into account different levels of prevention of kidney 
dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists are potential non-hormonal 
therapies for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women as options 
are scarce for those who cannot or do not want to take hormone therapy. 
Fezolinetant is one of the first non-hormonal neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists 
in development for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. This 
study investigated the safety and efficacy of fezolinetant for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.
METHODS: SKYLIGHT 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, 
phase 3 trial with a 40-week active treatment extension. This trial was done at 
97 facilities across the USA, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Spain, 
and the UK. Women aged 40-65 years with an average of seven or more 
moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 
once-daily exact-matched placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg, or fezolinetant 45 mg. 
Randomisation was done using a web-based interactive response system and 
investigators, project team members, clinical staff, and participants were 
masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary endpoints were mean change in 
frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms from baseline to weeks 4 and 12. 
The efficacy and safety analyses comprised all randomly assigned participants 
who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04003155) and is completed.
FINDINGS: Between July 11, 2019, and Aug 11, 2021, 2205 women were recruited of 
whom 175 were assigned to placebo, 176 to fezolinetant 30 mg, and 176 to 
fezolinetant 45 mg (175 in the placebo group, 174 in the fezolinetant 30 mg 
group, and 173 in the fezolinetant 45 mg received at least one dose [safety 
analysis set]). One participant randomly assigned to fezolinetant 45 mg received 
fezolinetant 30 mg in error, so the efficacy analysis set (full analysis set) 
consisted of 173 in the fezolinetant 30 mg group and 174 in the fezolinetant 45 
mg group. 23 participants in the placebo group, 31 in the fezolinetant 30 mg 
group, and 13 in the fezolinetant 45 mg group discontinued treatment before week 
12, mostly due to adverse events or participant withdrawal. Compared with 
placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg and fezolinetant 45 mg significantly reduced the 
frequency of vasomotor symptoms at week 4 (difference in change in least squares 
mean -1·87 [SE 0·42; p<0·001], -2·07 [SE 0·42; p<0·001]) and week 12 (-2·39 [SE 
0·44; p<0·001], -2·55 [SE 0·43; p<0·001]). Compared with placebo, fezolinetant 
30 mg and 45 mg significantly reduced the severity of vasomotor symptoms at week 
4 (-0·15 [0·06; p=0·012], -0·19 [0·06; p=0·002]) and week 12 (-0·24 [0·08; 
p=0·002], -0·20 [0·08; p=0·007]). Improvements in frequency and severity of 
vasomotor symptoms were observed after 1 week and maintained over 52 weeks. 
During the first 12 weeks, treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 65 
(37%) of 174 women in the fezolinetant 30 mg group, 75 (43%) of 173 in the 
fezolinetant 45 mg group, and 78 (45%) of 175 in the placebo group. The 
incidence of liver enzyme elevations was low (placebo n=1; fezolinetant 30 mg 
n=2; fezolinetant 45 mg n=0) and these events were generally asymptomatic, 
transient, and resolved while on treatment or after treatment discontinuation.
INTERPRETATION: Data support the clinical use of fezolinetant as a non-hormonal 
treatment for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The study was 
placebo-controlled for 12 weeks followed by a 40-week blinded extension to 
assess the maintenance of effect. Furthermore, the population studied was 
diverse and representative of the potential target population for fezolinetant 
therapy. Further characterisation of the benefit of fezolinetant on quality of 
life, including on symptoms of mood and sexual wellbeing, merits investigation.

For over two decades, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was able to 
help prolong the life expectancy of people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) and 
eliminate the virus to an undetectable level. However, an increased prevalence 
of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) was observed. These symptoms 
range from neuronal dysfunction to cell death. Among the markers of neuronal 
deregulation, we cite the alteration of synaptic plasticity and neuronal 
communications. Clinically, these dysfunctions led to neurocognitive disorders 
such as learning alteration and loss of spatial memory, which promote premature 
brain aging even in HAART-treated patients. In support of these observations, we 
showed that the gp120 protein deregulates miR-499-5p and its downstream target, 
the calcineurin (CaN) protein. The gp120 protein also promotes the accumulation 
of calcium (Ca2+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the neurons leading 
to the activation of CaN and the inhibition of miR-499-5p. gp120 protein also 
caused mitochondrial fragmentation and changes in shape and size. The use of 
mimic miR-499 restored mitochondrial functions, appearance, and size. These 
results demonstrated the additional effect of the gp120 protein on neurons 
through the miR-499-5p/calcineurin pathway.

BACKGROUND: Early access to diagnosis and care is essential to improve rates of 
survival from childhood cancer, particularly in low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). Composite indices are increasingly used to compare country 
performance in many health fields. We aimed to develop a composite vulnerability 
index of risk of mortality associated with delays in care for childhood cancer 
in LMICs, and to compare the vulnerability index scores across countries.
METHODS: The composite vulnerability index was built in ten steps. A previous 
systematic review of determinants of delays in cancer care for children guided 
data selection. We collected exposure variables (determinants of delays in care) 
and outcome variables (childhood cancer-related mortality) from several large 
datasets. Data were analysed with regression models to identify determinants of 
delays in care that contribute to childhood cancer mortality. Significant 
indicators were aggregated into domains according to the socio-ecological model. 
We used geospatial tools to summarise and compare the composite vulnerability 
index scores across countries.
FINDINGS: We found that life expectancy, maternal education, fertility rate, 
availability of pathology services, bone marrow transplantation capacity, 
availability of treatment services (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery), 
number of pharmacists per 10 000 population, country income level, and 
out-of-pocket health expenditure were significantly associated with cancer 
mortality for children in LMICs. The highest levels of vulnerability were found 
in sub-Saharan Africa.
INTERPRETATION: Our composite vulnerability index can potentially serve as a 
valuable policy decision tool to help monitor country performance and guide 
interventions to reduce delays in care for children with cancer in LMICs.

Expect Nothing: The (Lack of) Influence of Subjective Life Expectancy on 
Valuation of Child Health States.

Lipman SA(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Economics, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management, 
Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: Earlier research has shown that individuals' subjective life 
expectancy (SLE) affects health state valuation with time trade-off (TTO). 
Individuals with longer expected life durations are less willing to trade-off 
life duration, which yields higher utilities. In this article, the influence of 
SLE is explored in the valuation of EQ-5D-Y-3L with a proxy perspective, i.e., 
adults' valuation of health states considering the life of a 10-year-old child. 
As SLE for children is likely higher, this might explain earlier findings 
suggesting that individuals are less willing to trade-off years of life for 
children than for adults.
METHODS: A total of 197 respondents were recruited to take part in digital TTO 
interviews, facilitated by trained interviewers. TTO interviews were implemented 
in accordance with the recommended protocol for the valuation of EQ-5D-Y-3L. 
Respondents valued 10 EQ-5D-Y-3L health states for a 10-year-old child, after 
which they were asked to report how old they themselves expected to become and 
also how old they expected a 10-year-old child to become.
RESULTS: Generally, adult respondents reported higher SLE for children than for 
themselves. Neither SLE was systematically associated with the willingness to 
trade lifetime or the number of life years traded off in TTO tasks. This 
null-result was substantiated by regression analyses per health state.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that individuals' expectations 
about longevity are not associated with EQ-5D-Y-3L valuation. This lack of 
association is in contrast to earlier work and might be explained by the 
psychological distance introduced with proxy perspective valuation, or by the 
methodological differences with earlier work.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are the 
most frequent cancers in humans, with cumulative ultraviolet radiation exposure, 
aging, and immunodepression as the main risk factors. In most cases, these 
malignancies arise in the head and neck area, and they can be treated with 
locoregional therapies. A minority of cases require systemic therapy. Currently, 
Sonic Hedgehog inhibitors (i.e., vismodegib and sonidegib) have been approved 
for advanced BCC, while the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab has been 
approved as a first-line treatment for cSCC and as a second-line treatment for 
BCC. Nevertheless, there is a clinical need for an effective and safe systemic 
therapies for advanced synchronous (syn) BCC/cSCC not amenable to local 
treatments. International guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for 
patients affected by this condition, and no case reports on the full-dose 
association of these medications have been previously reported. Here, we present 
the cases of two elderly patients affected by synBCC/cSCC of the head and neck, 
who received combined therapy with cemiplimab and sonidegib at full dose and 
standard schedule, achieving remarkable clinical benefit and long-term 
responses, without major adverse events. The instance of a feasible treatment 
for patients with advanced synBCC/cSCC will become increasingly frequent with 
the advancement of life expectancy in the global population, and the synergistic 
activity of targeted therapies and immunotherapy-administered either in 
association or sequentially-deserves to be further explored.

Globally, a rapid demographic transition is occurring with a significant 
increment in the proportion of older individuals. For the first time in history, 
individuals aged 65 and above outnumber that of children under 5 years of age. 
In Ethiopia, the life expectancy has shown dramatic improvements in the past few 
decades and is expected to reach 74 years by mid-century. Older age is 
considered the most important non-modifiable risk factor for dementia. Likewise, 
other modifiable diseases such as infectious diseases, non-communicable 
diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, and traumatic brain injuries are 
associated with dementia. Despite, the high prevalence of dementia risk factors 
and impending economic and health impact from dementia, no country in the 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Ethiopia, has developed a standalone or an
