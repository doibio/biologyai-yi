To examine the interrelationship of aging extension and modification of lipid 
metabolism under chronic caloric restriction (CCR; reduced concentration of the 
green algae Tetraselmis suecica) in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus, 
we assessed life cycle parameters, fatty acid composition, and expression of 
sirtuin and genes related to lipid metabolism. B. koreanus in the 5% T. suecica 
group showed an increased life span but decreased reproduction. Based on this 
finding, we chose 5% T. suecica for further experiments and compared the data 
with those for 100% T. suecica. Upregulation of sirtuin gene expression was 
observed under CCR. In addition, despite the reduction in the amount of total 
fatty acid (FA) and the area of triacylglycerol, increases in the ratios of 
saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) to total FA in 
5%-exposed B. koreanus were observed. Furthermore, mRNA expression analysis 
confirmed that CCR promoted the synthesis of MUFA through Δ9 desaturase. 
Moreover, expression of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) synthesizing gene Δ4 
desaturase was also upregulated, together with DHA content. These data suggest 
that CCR modified protein acetylation and lipid metabolism, leading to a 
decrease in reproduction and consequently resulting in life span extension.

All animals constantly negotiate external with internal demands before and 
during action selection. Energy homeostasis is a major internal factor biasing 
action selection. For instance, in addition to physiologically regulating 
carbohydrate mobilization, starvation-induced sugar shortage also biases action 
selection toward food-seeking and food consumption behaviors (the 
counter-regulatory response). Biogenic amines are often involved when such 
widespread behavioral biases need to be orchestrated. In mammals, norepinephrine 
(noradrenalin) is involved in the counterregulatory response to 
starvation-induced drops in glucose levels. The invertebrate homolog of 
noradrenalin, octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA) are 
neuromodulators operating in many different neuronal and physiological 
processes. Tyrosine-ß-hydroxylase (tßh) mutants are unable to convert TA into 
OA. We hypothesized that tßh mutant flies may be aberrant in some or all of the 
counter-regulatory responses to starvation and that techniques restoring gene 
function or amine signaling may elucidate potential mechanisms and sites of 
action. Corroborating our hypothesis, starved mutants show a reduced sugar 
response and their hemolymph sugar concentration is elevated compared to control 
flies. When starved, they survive longer. Temporally controlled rescue 
experiments revealed an action of the OA/TA-system during the sugar response, 
while spatially controlled rescue experiments suggest actions also outside of 
the nervous system. Additionally, the analysis of two OA- and four TA-receptor 
mutants suggests an involvement of both receptor types in the animals' 
physiological and neuronal response to starvation. These results complement the 
investigations in Apis mellifera described in our companion paper (Buckemüller 
et al., 2017).

OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a medical condition that may have a harmful effect on 
health, leading to increased illness and reduced life expectancy. This 
studyaimed to evaluate the relationship of psychiatry disorders in overweight 
and obese children and adolescents.
MATERIALS & METHODS: In this case-control study, 160 children and adolescent 
were enrolled refereed to Clinic of Pediatric Endocrinology, Imam Reza hospital, 
Mashhad, Iran in 2009-2011. The sampling method of this study was 
non-probability and biased. Study instruments were SDQ, CDI, STAI, Peds QL. All 
questionnaires were self-administrating completed by subjects or their parents. 
Differences between groups were examined using t-test and chi-square tests as 
appropriate.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference on scores of anxiety between two 
groups. However, significant difference was on scores of depression, quality of 
life, and strength and difficulty between two groups. In addition, there was no 
significant difference in gender effect on anxiety and depression. However, 
emotional symptoms were more in girl. In contrast, the conduct problems were 
more in boys. Anxiety and depression were more in adolescents.
CONCLUSION: Obesity has a negative effect on the anxiety, depression, and 
self-esteem of children and adolescents. It might be a more important risk 
factor for depression, anxiety, and other psychiatry disorders. This study also 
emphasizes the importance of prevention of obesity.

Association between altered glycosylation patterns and poor prognosis in cancer 
points glycans as potential specific tumor markers. Most proteins are 
glycosylated and functionally arranged on cell surface and extracellular matrix, 
mediating interactions and cellular signaling. Thereby, aberrant glycans may be 
considered a pathological phenotype at least as important as changes in protein 
expression for cancer and other complex diseases. As most serum glycoproteins 
have hepatic origin, liver disease phenotypes, such as hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), may present altered glycan profile and display important modifications. 
One of the prominent obstacles in HCC is the diagnostic in advanced stages when 
patients have several liver dysfunctions, limiting treatment options and life 
expectancy. The characterization of glycomic profiles in pathological conditions 
by means of mass spectrometry (MS) may lead to the discovery of early diagnostic 
markers using non-invasive approaches. MS is a powerful analytical technique 
capable of elucidating many glycobiological issues and overcome limitations of 
the serological markers currently applied in clinical practice. Therefore, 
MS-based glycomics of tumor biomarkers is a promising tool to increase early 
detection and monitoring of disease.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of cognitive, sensory, and physical impairments is 
expected to grow alongside increasing life expectancy. These chronic conditions 
pose challenges for geriatric assessment. We examined whether Brief Cognitive 
Assessment Tool (BCAT) modifications to accommodate visual and motor limitations 
would retain strong validity for identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
dementia.
METHOD: Psychometric analyses were performed on archival data (N = 458) from 
community-dwelling older adults and residents of assisted living facilities and 
nursing homes in Maryland, USA (age ≥ 50 years). Participants completed a brief 
testing battery, including the BCAT, and were assigned a cognitive diagnosis 
(normal cognition, MCI, mild dementia, moderate dementia, severe dementia) by 
licensed clinical psychologists.
RESULTS: Receiver operator characteristic curve analyses evidenced excellent 
diagnostic validity of BCAT modification cutoffs for identifying the cognitive 
categories. Contextual memory and executive control factors, which explained 
over 80% of variance in cognitive diagnoses, may account for the preservation of 
validity despite BCAT modifications.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate strong psychometric evidence for the BCAT 
modifications and provide cutoffs for identifying MCI and staging dementia. For 
clinicians, the score guidelines are preferable to the guesswork involved with 
adjusting cutoffs to accommodate visual and motor limitations.

Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore HA7 4LP, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are the most common 
type of stem cell used in the regeneration of skeletal tissue. These cells have 
multipotent, angiogenic, paracrine, anti-fibrotic and immunological properties. 
They are readily available, easily isolated and have many therapeutic 
applications. The ageing population is on the increase and with this comes an 
upsurge in medical conditions that may benefit from novel stem cell-based 
therapies to treat ageingassociated diseases. Given that autologous 
implantations have shown to be beneficial in these targeted therapies, questions 
are raised regarding the effect of ageing and gender on the efficacy of stem 
cells.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we look at the ageing process and look at the effects 
of ageing and gender on the characterization, proliferation and differentiation 
of mesenchymal stem cells. We also discuss future therapeutic strategies that 
may be used to overcome these effects and cell senescence.
CONCLUSION: Advancements in modern technology and experimental techniques have 
provided an insight into how ageing affects properties of MSCs. However, it is 
evident that further work needs to be conducted due to many mixed reviews and 
conflicting data. Given that the human life expectancy is expected to increase 
the topic of cell ageing and therapeutic applications will remain a hot topic in 
years to come.

[The influence of diets on metabolic processes associated with sirtuin1].

[Article in Russian]

Fefelova YA, Sergeeva EY, Novikova LV, Klimina GM.

Over the last decade the investigations of the sirtuin protein family have 
become one of the research priorities. It is connected with the fact that 
sirtuins play an important role as regulators of cell homeostasis in mammals. 
Sirtuins can regulate metabolism by the influence on some processes in CNS, 
liver, pancreas, musles, adipose tissue. It emphasizes the importance of 
sirtuins in the development of heart diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome, 
neurodegenerative and some other diseases. Stress factors in particular calorie 
restriction alter sirtuins activity, that leads to some significant alterations 
of intracellular processes: activation of reparation processes, increase of DNA 
stability, elevation of metabolic rate and the lifespan of cells. In this 
review, we focus our attention on the influence of calorie restriction on 
metabolic alterations associated with regulatory role of sirtuin1. Sirtuin1 
plays a leading role in regulation of cell homeostasis by controlling some 
important processes, such as gene transcription, cell differentiation, stress 
reaction, inflammation, apoptosis, circadian rhythms and life expectancy. We 
touch briefly on the connection between some alterations of diet and the 
development of stress reaction and inflammation. In the review the metabolic 
alterations in liver, pancreas, adipose tissue and central regulatory role of 
sirtuinl in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis connected with calorie 
restriction are discussed. Sirtuin1 can be a messenger of some effects of 
calorie restriction on organism, acting as a cell energy sensor. Thus, sirtuinl 
plays a central role in control and modulation of metabolic processes under 
alterations of diet. Having been one of the most important regulator of 
homeostasis, sirtuinl can be a key element of regulation. The influence on this 
element gives the opportunities of regulation of metabolism, calorie restriction 
effects and creation of new pathogenical methods of treatment.

AIMS: To review clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence underlying 
reimbursement decisions relating to drugs whose authorization mainly is based on 
evidence from prospective case series.
METHODS: A systematic review of all new drugs evaluated in 2011-2016 within a 
health care profession-driven resource prioritization process, with a market 
approval based on prospective case series, and a reimbursement decision by the 
Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV). Public assessment 
reports from the European Medicines Agency, published pivotal studies, and TLV, 
Scottish Medicines Consortium and National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence decisions and guidance documents were reviewed.
RESULTS: Six drug cases were assessed (brentuximab vedotin, bosutinib, 
ponatinib, idelalisib, vismodegib, ceritinib). The validity of the pivotal 
studies was hampered by the use of surrogate primary outcomes and the absence of 
recruitment information. To quantify drug treatment effect sizes, the 
reimbursement agencies primarily used data from another source in indirect 
comparisons. TLV granted reimbursement in five cases, compared with five in five 
cases for Scottish Medicines Consortium and four in five cases for National 
Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Decision modifiers, contributing to 
granted reimbursement despite hugely uncertain cost-effectiveness ratios, were, 
for example, small population size, occasionally linked to budget impact, 
severity of disease, end of life and improved life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: For drugs whose authorization is based on prospective case series, 
most applications for reimbursement within public health care are granted. The 
underlying evidence has limitations over and above the design per se, and 
decision modifiers are frequently referred to in the value-based pricing 
decision making.

INTRODUCTION: Current prostate cancer risk calculators are limited in impact 
because only a probability of having prostate cancer is provided. We developed 
the next generation of prostate cancer risk calculator that incorporates life 
expectancy in order to better evaluate prostate cancer risk in context to a 
patient's age and comorbidity.
METHODS: We combined two cohorts to develop the new risk calculator. The first 
was 5638 subjects who all underwent a prostate biopsy for prostate cancer 
detection. The second was 979 men diagnosed with prostate cancer with long-term 
survival data. Two regression models were used to create multivariable nomograms 
and an online prostate cancer risk calculator was developed.
RESULTS: Of the 5638 patients who underwent a prostate biopsy, 629 (11%) were 
diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason Score 7[4+3] or more). Of the 
979 patients who underwent treatment for prostate cancer, the 10-year overall 
survival (OS) was 49.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.6-52.9). The first 
multivariable nomogram for cancer risk had a concordance index of 0.74 (95% CI 
0.72, 0.76), and the second nomogram to predict survival had a concordance index 
of 0.71 (95% CI 0.69-0.72). The next-generation prostate cancer risk calculator 
was developed online and is available at: 
http://riskcalc.org/ProstateCA_Screen_Tool.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed the next-generation prostate cancer risk 
calculator that incorporates a patient's life expectancy based on age and 
comorbidity. This approach will better evaluate prostate cancer risk. Future 
studies examining other populations will be needed for validation.

Comparison of outcomes in hematological malignancies treated with haploidentical 
or HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following 
myeloablative conditioning: A meta-analysis.

Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Gulou district, Nanjing, People's 
Republic of China.

PURPOSE: Haploidentical and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling 
hematopoietic stem transplantation are two main ways used in allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In recent years, remarkable 
progress has been made in haploidentical allo-HSCT (HID-SCT), and some 
institutions found HID-SCT had similar outcomes as HLA-identical sibling 
allo-HSCT (ISD-SCT). To clarify if HID-SCT has equal effects to ISD-SCT in 
hematologic malignancies, we performed this meta-analysis.
METHODS: Relevant articles published prior to February 2017 were searched on 
PubMed. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies and extracted 
data independently. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Seven studies including 1919 patients were included. The rate of 
platelet engraftment is significantly lower after HID-SCT versus ISD-SCT while 
there is no difference in neutrophil engraftment (OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.70-3.93, 
P < 0.00001). The risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is 
significantly higher after HID-SCT versus ISD-SCT (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 
1.42-2.49, P < 0.00001), but the relapse rate is lower in HID-SCT group (OR = 
0.70, 95% CI = 0.55-0.90, P = 0.005). The incidence rates of overall survival 
(OS) and disease-free-survival/leukemia-free survival/relapse-free survival 
(DFS/LFS/RFS) after ISD-SCT are all significantly superior to HID-SCT (OR = 
1.32, 95% CI = 1.08-1.62, P = 0.006; OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03-1.52, P = 0.02). 
There is no significant difference in transplantation related mortality (TRM) 
rate after HID-SCT and ISD-SCT.
CONCLUSION: After myeloablative conditioning, patients receiving ISD-SCT have a 
faster engraftment, lower acute GVHD and longer life expectancy compared to 
HID-SCT with GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine A, methotrexate, mycophenolate 
mofetil and antithymoglobulin; CsA + MTX + MMF + ATG). Currently, HID-SCT with 
GVHD prophylaxis (CsA + MTX + MMF + ATG) may not replace ISD-SCT when 
HLA-identical sibling donor available.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that short sleep duration may be a newly 
identified modifiable risk factor for obesity, yet there is a paucity of studies 
to investigate this.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the feasibility of a personalized sleep extension 
protocol in adults aged 18-64 y who are habitually short sleepers (5 to <7 h), 
with sleep primarily measured by wrist actigraphy. In addition, we collected 
pilot data to assess the effects of extended sleep on dietary intake and quality 
measured by 7-d food diaries, resting and total energy expenditure, physical 
activity, and markers of cardiometabolic health.
DESIGN: Forty-two normal-weight healthy participants who were habitually short 
sleepers completed this free-living, 4-wk, parallel-design randomized controlled 
trial. The sleep extension group (n = 21) received a behavioral consultation 
session targeting sleep hygiene. The control group (n = 21) maintained habitual 
short sleep.
RESULTS: Rates of participation, attrition, and compliance were 100%, 6.5%, and 
85.7%, respectively. The sleep extension group significantly increased time in 
bed [0:55 hours:minutes (h:mm); 95% CI: 0:37, 1:12 h:mm], sleep period (0:47 
h:mm; 95% CI: 0:29, 1:05 h:mm), and sleep duration (0:21 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:06, 
0:36 h:mm) compared with the control group. Sleep extension led to reduced 
intake of free sugars (-9.6 g; 95% CI: -16.0, -3.1 g) compared with control (0.7 
g; 95% CI: -5.7, 7.2 g) (P = 0.042). A sensitivity analysis in plausible 
reporters showed that the sleep extension group reduced intakes of fat 
(percentage), carbohydrates (grams), and free sugars (grams) in comparison to 
the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in 
markers of energy balance or cardiometabolic health.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed the feasibility of extending sleep in adult short 
sleepers. Sleep extension led to reduced free sugar intakes and may be a viable 
strategy to facilitate limiting excessive consumption of free sugars in an 
obesity-promoting environment. This trial was registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02787577.

BACKGROUND: Although current beta cell replacement therapy is effective in 
stabilizing glycemic control in highly selected patients with refractory type 1 
diabetes, many hurdles are inherent to this and other donor-based 
transplantation methods. One solution could be moving to stem cell-derived 
transplant tissue. This study investigates a novel stem cell-derived graft and 
implant technology and explores the circumstances of its cost-effectiveness 
compared to intensive insulin therapy.
METHODS: We used a manufacturing optimization model based on work by Simaria et 
al. to model cost of the stem cell-based transplant doses and integrated its 
results into a cost-effectiveness model of diabetes treatments. The disease 
model simulated marginal differences in clinical effects and costs between the 
new technology and our comparator intensive insulin therapy. The form of beta 
cell replacement therapy was as a series of retrievable subcutaneous implant 
devices which protect the enclosed pancreatic progenitors cells from the immune 
system. This approach was presumed to be as effective as state of the art islet 
transplantation, aside from immunosuppression drawbacks. We investigated two 
different cell culture methods and several production and delivery scenarios.
RESULTS: We found the likely range of treatment costs for this form of graft 
tissue for beta cell replacement therapy. Additionally our results show this 
technology could be cost-effective compared to intensive insulin therapy, at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. 
However, results also indicate that mass production has by far the best chance 
of providing affordable graft tissue, while overall there seems to be 
considerable room for cost reductions.
CONCLUSIONS: Such a technology can improve treatment access and quality of life 
for patients through increased graft supply and protection. Stem cell-based 
implants can be a feasible way of treating a wide range of patients with type 1 
diabetes.

Exercise stress testing of the pulmonary circulation for the diagnosis of latent 
or early-stage pulmonary hypertension (PH) is gaining acceptance. There is 
emerging consensus to define exercise-induced PH by a mean pulmonary artery 
pressure > 30 mm Hg at a cardiac output < 10 L/min and a total pulmonary 
vascular resistance> 3 Wood units at maximum exercise, in the absence of PH at 
rest. Exercise-induced PH has been reported in association with a bone 
morphogenetic receptor-2 gene mutation, in systemic sclerosis, in left heart 
conditions, in chronic lung diseases, and in chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. 
Exercise-induced PH is a cause of decreased exercise capacity, may precede the 
development of manifest PH in a proportion of patients, and is associated with a 
decreased life expectancy. Exercise stress testing of the pulmonary circulation 
has to be dynamic and rely on measurements of the components of the pulmonary 
vascular equation during, not after exercise. Noninvasive imaging measurements 
may be sufficiently accurate in experienced hands, but suffer from lack of 
precision, so that invasive measurements are required for individual 
decision-making. Exercise-induced PH is caused either by pulmonary 
vasoconstriction, pulmonary vascular remodeling, or by increased upstream 
transmission of pulmonary venous pressure. This differential diagnosis is 
clinical. Left heart disease as a cause of exercise-induced PH can be further 
ascertained by a pulmonary artery wedge pressure above or below 20 mm Hg at a 
cardiac output < 10 L/min or a pulmonary artery wedge pressure-flow relationship 
above or below 2 mm Hg/L/min during exercise.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy continues to increase in developed countries. 
Elderly people are more likely to consume more medications and become vulnerable 
to age-related changes in drugs' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Recent 
studies have identified opportunities and barriers for deprescribing potentially 
inappropriate medications. It has already been demonstrated that computerised 
decision support systems can reduce physician orders for unnecessary tests. We 
will systematically review the available literature to understand if 
computerised decision support is effective in reducing the use of potentially 
inappropriate medications, thus having an impact on health outcomes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will be conducted using MEDLINE, 
CENTRAL, EMBASE and Web of Science databases, as well as the grey literature 
assessing the effectiveness of computer decision support interventions in 
deprescribing inappropriate medication, with an impact on health outcomes in the 
elderly. The search will be performed during January and February 2018. Two 
reviewers will conduct articles' screening, selection and data extraction, 
independently and blind to each other. Eligible sources will be selected after 
discussing non-conformities. All extracted data from the included articles will 
be assessed based on studies' participants, design and setting, methodological 
quality, bias and any other potential sources of heterogeneity. This review will 
be conducted and reported in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement of quality for reporting 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As a systematic review, this research is exempt from 
ethical approval. We intend to publish the full article in a related 
peer-reviewed journal and present it at international conferences.

Despite review papers claim for radical treatment of oligometastatic patients, 
only few surgical series have been published. In this study, we analyze results 
and actual role of surgical resection for the management of patients with 
multiple brain metastases. This retrospective study compares surgical results of 
two groups of patients consecutively treated in our Institute from January 2004 
to June 2015. The first group comprises all 32 patients with multiple brain 
metastases with only 2-3 lesions who underwent surgical resection of all 
lesions; the second group comprises 30 patients with a single surgically treated 
brain mestastasis compatible with the first group (match-paired control series). 
Median survival was 14.6 months for patients with multiple brain metastases 
(range 1-28 months) and 17.4 months for patients with a single brain metastasis 
(range 4-38 months); the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2). 
Neurological condition improved in 59.4% of patients with multiple metastases, 
it remained unchanged in 37.5% and worsened in 3.1%. In our series, selected 
patients with only 2-3 lesions with well-controlled systemic disease, life 
expectancy of more than 3 months, Karnofsky's performance status > 60, and 
surgically accessible lesions, benefited from surgical treatment in terms of 
survival and quality of life, with reduction or disappearance of significant 
neurological deficits. The prognosis for these patients is similar to that of 
patients with a single metastasis. It seems that patients with breast cancer 
included in our series had the worst prognosis if compared to other histotypes.

Improvements in living conditions and progress in medical management have 
resulted in better quality of life and longer life expectancy. Therefore, the 
number of older people undergoing surgery is increasing. Frailty is often 
described as a syndrome in aged patients where there is augmented vulnerability 
due to progressive loss of functional reserves. Studies suggest that frailty 
predisposes elderly to worsening outcome after surgery. Since emergency surgery 
is associated with higher mortality rates, it is paramount to have an accurate 
stratification of surgical risk in such patients. The aim of our study is to 
characterize the clinicopathological findings, management, and short-term 
outcome of elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery. The secondary 
objectives are to evaluate the presence and influence of frailty and analyze the 
prognostic role of existing risk-scores. The final FRAILESEL protocol was 
approved by the Ethical Committee of "Sapienza" University of Rome, Italy. The 
FRAILESEL study is a nationwide, Italian, multicenter, observational study 
conducted through a resident-led model. Patients over 65 years of age who 
require emergency surgical procedures will be included in this study. The 
primary outcome measures are 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity rates. 
The Clavien-Dindo classification system is used to categorize complications. The 
secondary outcome measures include length of hospital stay, length of stay in 
intensive care unit, and predictive value for morbidity and mortality of several 
frailty and surgical risk-scores. The results of the FRAILESEL study will be 
disseminated through national and international conference presentations and 
peer-reviewed journals. The study is also registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02825082).

Brain metastasis (BM) is one of the dreadful complications of malignancies. The 
prognosis after BM is extremely poor and life expectancy is meager. Currently, 
our treatment modalities are limited to radiotherapy and surgical resection, 
which also has poor outcomes and leads to various neurological deficits and 
affects the quality of life of patients. New treatment modality, i.e., immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, has brought revolution in management of melanoma, renal 
cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
basically enhance the immune response of the body to fight against cancers. 
Immune response in the brain is highly regulated; therefore, it is challenging 
to use immune-modulator drugs in BM. The microenvironment of BM is rich in 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes and which is the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
Few studies have shown some hope regarding use of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
in management of BM. It works through inhibiting immune check point gates, i.e., 
CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein) and PD-1/PD-L1 (programmed 
cell death protein-1/program death ligand-1). This article explains the basic 
mechanism of immune check point inhibitors, rationale behind their usage in BM, 
and some of the clinical studies which have shown the efficacy of immune check 
point inhibitors in BM.

Point-of-Care Phenotypic and Genetic Testing for U.S. Elderly Patients After 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

BACKGROUND: Poor health outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
in elderly patients is an area of concern among policymakers and administrators. 
In an effort to determine the best strategy to improve outcomes among elderly 
patients who underwent PCI, several studies have evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy compared with 
universal use of any one of the antiplatelet drugs indicated for patients with 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent PCI. The results have either been in 
favor of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy or universal use of ticagrelor. 
However, no study has yet evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
pharmacist-provided face-to-face medication therapy management (MTM) combined 
with point-of-care genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy (POCP) when compared 
with universal use of ticagrelor or clopidogrel for the elderly after PCI.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist integration of MTM 
with POCP (MTM-POCP) when compared with universal use of ticagrelor or 
clopidogrel combined with MTM (MTM-ticagrelor or MTM-clopidogrel).
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the 
U.S. health care system. A hybrid model, consisting of a 1-year decision tree 
and a 20-year Markov model, was used to simulate a cohort of elderly patients 
(aged at least 65 years) with ACS who underwent PCI. Treatment strategies 
available to patients were POCP, POCP-MTM, MTM-clopidogrel, or MTM-ticagrelor. 
Data used to populate the model were obtained from the PLATO trial and other 
published studies. Outcome measures were costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained. A deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for the joint uncertainty around 
the key parameters of the model. Finally, a benchmark willingness to pay of 
$50,000-200,000 was considered.
RESULTS: The use of PCOP (with dual antiplatelet therapy) resulted in 5.29 
QALYs, at a cost of $50,207. MTM-clopidogrel resulted in 5.34 QALYs, at a cost 
of $50,011. The use of POCP-MTM resulted in 5.36 QALYs, at a cost of $50,270. 
Finally, MTM-ticagrelor resulted in 5.42 QALYs, at a cost of $53,346. 
MTM-ticagrelor was found to be cost-effective compared with MTM-clopidogrel or 
MTM-POCP, irrespective of the willingness to pay. The deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the base-case 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MTM-ticagrelor was cost-effective when compared 
with MTM-POCP or MTM-clopidogrel. The transitional probabilities, however, were 
mostly based on published studies. Analysis based on a prospective randomized 
clinical study, comparing all the treatment strategies included in this study, 
is warranted to confirm our findings.

Loss of life expectancy derived from a standardized mortality ratio in Denmark, 
Finland, Norway and Sweden.

AIMS: The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is a widely used measure. A recent 
methodological study provided an accurate approximate relationship between an 
SMR and difference in lifetime expectancies. This study examines the usefulness 
of the theoretical relationship, when comparing historic mortality data in four 
Scandinavian populations.
METHODS: For Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, data on mortality every fifth 
year in the period 1950 to 2010 were obtained. Using 1980 as the reference year, 
SMRs and difference in life expectancy were calculated. The assumptions behind 
the theoretical relationship were examined graphically. The theoretical 
relationship predicts a linear association with a slope, [Formula: see text], 
between log(SMR) and difference in life expectancies, and the theoretical 
prediction and calculated differences in lifetime expectancies were compared. We 
examined the linear association both for life expectancy at birth and at age 30. 
All analyses were done for females, males and the total population.
RESULTS: The approximate relationship provided accurate predictions of actual 
differences in lifetime expectancies. The accuracy of the predictions was better 
when age was restricted to above 30, and improved if the changes in mortality 
rate were close to a proportional change. Slopes of the linear relationship were 
generally around 9 for females and 10 for males.
CONCLUSIONS: The theoretically derived relationship between SMR and difference 
in life expectancies provides an accurate prediction for comparing populations 
with approximately proportional differences in mortality, and was relatively 
robust. The relationship may provide a useful prediction of differences in 
lifetime expectancies, which can be more readily communicated and understood.

OBJECTIVES: To determine age group- and cause-of-death-specific contributions to 
area socioeconomic status (SES), sex and remoteness life expectancy 
inequalities.
METHODS: Mortality and estimated residential population data from New South 
Wales, Australia, over 2010-2012 was used to calculate life expectancy. 
Inequalities by sociodemographic groups were partitioned into age group- and 
cause-of-death-specific contributions.
RESULTS: The largest contributions to SES differentials in life expectancy were 
observed at 60-84 years of age; for cancer, cardiovascular, endocrine and 
respiratory causes of death; and additionally external causes of death for 
males. Sex inequalities ranged from 3.6 to 5.2 years, with common causes of 
death such as cardiovascular disease and cancer in late adulthood (60+ years) 
accounting for the bulk of the differences. Smaller differences in life 
expectancy were observed by remoteness, with the largest contributions observed 
in ages 85 years and above, and for cardiovascular, mental, cancer and external 
causes of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Common causes of death in late adulthood accounted for the bulk of 
life expectancy inequalities. Implications for public health: Development of 
policy and interventions aimed at addressing social determinants, such as 
proposed by the WHO's Global Plan of Action, are needed to help reduce 
sociodemographic inequalities in lifespan.
