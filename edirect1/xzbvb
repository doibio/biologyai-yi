treatment of both degenerative and functional MR, taking into account current 
surgical and percutaneous options. In addition, since a clear understanding of 
the etiology and mechanisms of valvular dysfunction is important to guide the 
timing and choice of treatment, the role of the heart team and of echo imaging 
in the management of MR is addressed as well.

[SUBSTANTIATION OF DOSE LIMITS FOR A NEW NORMATIVE DOCUMENT ON RADIATION SAFETY 
OF LONG-DURATION SPACE MISSIONS AT ORBIT ALTITUDES OF UP TO 500 KM].

[Article in Russian]

Ushakov IB, Grigoriev YG, Shafirkin AV, Shurshakov VA.

Review of the data of experimental radiobiology and epidemiological follow-up of 
large groups of people subjected to radiation exposures on Earth has been 
undertaken to substantiate dose limits for critical organs of cosmonauts in 
order to ensure good performance and vitality while on long-duration orbital 
missions. The career dose limits for cosmonauts and astronauts established 
earlier in the USSR and USA amounted to nothing more but banning the risk of 
cancer death increase to 3%. To apply more rigorous criteria of delayed 
radiation risks, the Russian limits for cosmonauts were revised to substantiate 
a 4-fold reduction of the average tissue equivalent dose maximum to 1 Sv. The 
total of cancer and non-cancer radiation risks over lifetime and probable 
reduction of mean life expectancy (MLE) were calculated using the model of 
radiation-induced mortality for mammals and taken as the main damage to health. 
The established dose limit is equal to the career dose for nuclear industry 
personnel set forth by Russian standard document NRB 99/2009. For better 
agreement of admissible threshold doses to critical human organs (bone marrow, 
lens and skin) in the revised radiation limits for long-duration space missions 
and radiation safety limits on Earth, reduction of dose limits for the critical 
organs were substantiated additionally; these limits comply with those for 
planned over-exposure on Earth in document NRB 99/2009.

PURPOSE: Up to one third of epilepsy patients develop pharmacoresistant seizures 
and many benefit from resective surgery. However, patients with non-lesional 
focal epilepsy often require intracranial monitoring to localize the seizure 
focus. Intracranial monitoring carries operative morbidity risk and does not 
always succeed in localizing the seizures, making the benefit of this approach 
less certain. We performed a decision analysis comparing three strategies for 
patients with non-lesional focal epilepsy: (1) intracranial monitoring, (2) 
vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) implantation and (3) medical management to 
determine which strategy maximizes the expected quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for our base cases.
METHOD: We constructed two base cases using parameters reported in the medical 
literature: (1) a young, otherwise healthy patient and (2) an elderly, otherwise 
healthy patient. We constructed a decision tree comprising strategies for the 
treatment of non-lesional epilepsy and two clinical outcomes: seizure freedom 
and no seizure freedom. Sensitivity analyses of probabilities at each branch 
were guided by data from the medical literature to define decision thresholds 
across plausible parameter ranges.
RESULTS: Intracranial monitoring maximizes the expected QALYs for both base 
cases. The sensitivity analyses provide estimates of the values of key 
variables, such as the surgical risk or the chance of localizing the focus, at 
which intracranial monitoring is no longer favored.
CONCLUSION: Intracranial monitoring is favored over VNS and medical management 
in young and elderly patients over a wide, clinically-relevant range of 
pertinent model variables such as the chance of localizing the seizure focus and 
the surgical morbidity rate.

AIM: Previous estimates of life-years lost to diabetes are highly inconsistent. 
This study provided the updated estimates of life-years lost to diabetes in the 
United States.
METHODS: Each of a nationally representative sample of 21,829 adults with 
diabetes in the U.S. National Health Interview Survey 1997-2009 was individually 
matched to one without diabetes by age, sex, race, survey year, BMI, smoking 
status, pre-existing cardiovascular disease and pre-existing cancer. All-cause 
mortality from original surveys to 31 December 2011 and median survival ages 
were estimated for those with diabetes and their matched controls.
RESULTS: Overall median survival age for adults with diabetes was 10.5years 
shorter than that for matched controls without diabetes. Estimated life-years 
lost associated with diabetes decreased with increasing age at diagnosis from 
20.0years for those diagnosed before age 20years to no difference for those 
diagnosed after 80years. Hazard ratios for mortality decreased from 3.03 (95% 
CI: 2.41, 3.80) for those with diabetes diagnosed before 20years to 1.04 (95% 
CI: 0.78, 1.39) for those diagnosed after 80years. The estimate of life-years 
lost associated with diabetes was much higher among those with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease (20.3years) than among those without cardiovascular 
disease (8.5years).
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of diabetes on survival depends on age at first 
diagnosis of diabetes and the presence of pre-existing diseases. The life-years 
lost are higher for those with diabetes diagnosed at younger ages. This study 
provided the updated estimates of life-years lost associated with diabetes in 
the United States.

BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is an X-linked recessive, 
multisystemic lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of 
iduronate-2-sulfatase. MPS II has a variable age of onset and variable rate of 
progression. In Asian countries, there is a relatively higher incidence of MPS 
II compared to other types of MPS.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out of 34 Taiwanese MPS II 
patients who died between 1995 and 2012. The clinical characteristics, medical 
records, age at death, and cause of death were evaluated to better understand 
the natural progression of this disease.
RESULTS: The mean age at death of 31 of the patients with a severe form of the 
disease with significant cognitive impairment was 13.2 ± 3.2 years, compared 
with 22.6 ± 4.3 years in the three patients with a mild form of the disease 
without cognitive involvement (n = 2) or the intermediate form (n = 1) 
(p < 0.001). The mean ages at onset of symptoms and confirmed diagnosis were 
2.5 ± 2.1 and 4.8 ± 3.1 years, respectively (n = 32). Respiratory failure was 
the leading cause of death (56 %), followed by cardiac failure (18 %), 
post-traumatic organ failure (3 %), and infection (sepsis) (3 %) (n = 27). Age 
at onset of symptoms was positively correlated with life expectancy (p < 0.01). 
Longevity gradually increased over time from 1995 to 2012 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory failure and cardiac failure were the two major causes 
of death in these patients. The life expectancy of Taiwanese MPS II patients has 
improved in recent decade.

Tokyo, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: The second phase of Healthy Japan 21 seeks to increase 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) more than life expectancy (LE) between 
2013 and 2022. In the face of the rising incidence of disability, the 
feasibility of achieving this goal remains unclear.
METHODS: We examine changes in DFLE at birth between 2000 and 2010 across 47 
prefectures, with particular attention given to changes in the absolute number 
of years and in the proportion of disability-free life years.
RESULTS: Although LE increased across all prefectures, there is a variation in 
DFLE. While the number of disability-free life years increased in many parts of 
the country, some prefectures had decreases in DFLE. Downturns become 
particularly evident when DFLE is interpreted in relative terms. The proportion 
of life spent without disability declined in the majority of prefectures.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from subnational level analyses suggest that the rate of 
increase in DFLE lagged behind that in LE across Japanese prefectures during the 
past decade. More policy attention should be devoted to health-promotion 
initiatives at the prefecture level to achieve the nationwide health agenda.

BACKGROUND: Precursors to anal squamous cell carcinoma may be detectable through 
screening; however, the literature suggests that population-level testing is not 
cost-effective. Given that high-grade cervical neoplasia (CIN) is associated 
with an increased risk of developing anal cancer, and in light of changing 
guidelines for the follow-up and management of cervical neoplasia, it is 
worthwhile to examine the costs and effectiveness of an anal cancer screening 
program delivered to women with previously-detected CIN.
METHODS: A model of anal cancer screening and treatment was constructed, to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of a population of CIN II/III+ women who were 
screened using anal cytology vs. one that received no anal cancer screening. 
Costs were based on Canadian estimates, and survival was based on estimates 
taken from the scientific literature. Effectiveness was measured in terms of 
life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model was 
run for 50 cycles, with each cycle representing one year.
RESULTS: Incremental cost (screened vs. unscreened) was $82.17 per woman in the 
model. Incremental effectiveness was 0.004 LYG, and was equivalent to zero in 
terms of QALY. An ICER of $20,561/LYG was calculated, while no meaningful 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) could be calculated for 
quality-adjusted survival.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that anal cancer screening is cost-effective 
in terms of overall survival in women with a previous diagnosis of CIN II or CIN 
III as part of regular follow-up, but may not contribute meaningfully-different 
quality-adjusted survival due to the adverse effects of screening-related 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with human immunodeficiency 
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) reported by several 
epidemiological studies is inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to 
estimate the survival rate from HIV diagnosis to AIDS onset and from AIDS onset 
to death.
METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were 
searched to February 2016. In addition, the reference lists of included studies 
were checked to identify further references, and the database of the 
International AIDS Society was also searched. Cohort studies addressing the 
survival rate in patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were included in this 
meta-analysis. The outcomes of interest were the survival rate of patients 
diagnosed with HIV progressing to AIDS, and the survival rate of patients with 
AIDS dying from AIDS-related causes with or without highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART). The survival rate (P) was estimated with 95% confidence 
intervals based on random-effects models.
RESULTS: In total, 27,862 references were identified, and 57 studies involving 
294,662 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Two, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10- 
and 12-year survival probabilities of progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS 
onset were estimated to be 82%, 72%, 64%, 57%, 26% and 19%, respectively. Two, 
4-, 6-, 8- and 10-year survival probabilities of progression from AIDS onset to 
AIDS-related death in patients who received HAART were estimated to be 87%, 86%, 
78%, 78%, and 61%, respectively, and 2-, 4- and 6-year survival probabilities of 
progression from AIDS onset to AIDS-related death in patients who did not 
receive HAART were estimated to be 48%, 26% and 18%, respectively. Evidence of 
considerable heterogeneity was found. The majority of the studies had a moderate 
to high risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: The majority of HIV-positive patients progress to AIDS within the 
first decade of diagnosis. Most patients who receive HAART will survive for 
>10 years after the onset of AIDS, whereas the majority of the patients who do 
not receive HAART die within 2 years of the onset of AIDS.

Because rice feeds half of the world's population, a secure global food supply 
depends on sustainable rice production. Here we test whether the co-cultivation 
of rice and fish into one "rice-fish system" (RFS; fish refers to aquatic 
animals in this article) could help sustain rice production. We examined 
intensive and traditional RFSs that have been widely practiced in China. We 
found that rice yields did not decrease when fish yield was below a threshold 
value in each intensive RFS. Below the thresholds, moreover, fish yields in 
intensive RFSs can be substantially higher than those in traditional RFS without 
reducing rice yield. Relative to rice monoculture, the use of 
fertilizer-nitrogen and pesticides decreased, and the farmers' net income 
increased in RFSs. The results suggest that RFSs can help sustain rice 
production, and suggest that development of co-culture technologies (i.e. proper 
field configuration for fish and rice) is necessary to achieve the 
sustainability.

Nonenzymatic copying of RNA templates containing all four letters is catalyzed

The nonenzymatic replication of RNA is a potential transitional stage between 
the prebiotic chemistry of nucleotide synthesis and the canonical RNA world in 
which RNA enzymes (ribozymes) catalyze replication of the RNA genomes of 
primordial cells. However, the plausibility of nonenzymatic RNA replication is 
undercut by the lack of a protocell-compatible chemical system capable of 
copying RNA templates containing all four nucleotides. We show that short 
5'-activated oligonucleotides act as catalysts that accelerate primer extension, 
and allow for the one-pot copying of mixed sequence RNA templates. The fidelity 
of the primer extension products resulting from the sequential addition of 
activated monomers, when catalyzed by activated oligomers, is sufficient to 
sustain a genome long enough to encode active ribozymes. Finally, by 
immobilizing the primer and template on a bead and adding individual monomers in 
sequence, we synthesize a significant part of an active hammerhead ribozyme, 
forging a link between nonenzymatic polymerization and the RNA world.

Recently, there have been many studies of health services combined with smart 
devices, gathering a user' health lifelog and managing his or her health for the 
improvement of the quality of his or her life, using various sensors. However, 
previous works have problems in the extraction of patterns in person's complex 
health lifelog, the analysis of complex relations among those patterns, the 
extension of them to related services, and reuse of lifelog patterns. The 
healthcare lifelogs should search efficiently data necessary for users from big 
data because those gather real-time data of various types of data. The 
healthcare lifelogs should search efficiently data necessary for users from big 
data because those gather real-time data of various types of data. In this 
paper, we propose the intelligent healthcare service for reasoning personal 
health state with data extraction, pattern analysis, health life ontology 
modeling using health lifelog analysis based on smart devices. The proposed 
health information service provided more and more appropriate service with users 
if more reasoning rules related to more and various healthcare lifelog 
information gathering are included in the service.

[Prioritization strategies in the care of multimorbid patients in family 
medicine].

[Article in French]

Quinodoz A, Déruaz-Luyet A, N'Goran AA, Herzig L.

The aging of the population together with the increasing life expectancy lead to 
a drastic increase in the number of patients with multi-morbidity (MM). Caring 
for these patients is time-consuming and the treatment of multiple conditions 
might be burdensome. Therefore both general practitioner (GP) and patients need 
to establish priorities and, among others, to decide which pathology to treat 
primarily or to which treatment to renounce. How they do this is currently 
unknown. This qualitative study based on individual interviews reports 
prioritization's strategies used by five GPs and five of their patients in 
Switzerland. Our study underlined the importance of the discussion between GPs 
and their patients and the use of the shared decision-making in the 
prioritization process.

[Integration of a palliative care approach in the management patients with 
polymorbidity].

[Article in French]

Pautex S, Weber C.

The number of patients with multimorbidity is steadily increasing due to medical 
progress and increased life expectancy. A palliative approach may be offered to 
some of these patients. It includes the detection and management of somatic and 
mental symptoms, the management of social and spiritual problems, the 
anticipation of care and support of the relatives. Its main goal is to improve 
patient's quality of life and reduce interventions that are unnecessary, or 
undesired by patients themselves.

INTRODUCTION: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with 
haemophilia has greatly improved with the use of factor replacement and routine 
prophylaxis.
AIM: To explore the HRQoL of individuals with haemophilia B treated with nonacog 
beta pegol, an extended half-life recombinant factor IX, in a single-blind, 
randomized multinational phase III pivotal trial (paradigm(™) 2) and its 
open-label extension (paradigm(™) 4).
METHODS: In the pivotal trial, adolescents and adults with haemophilia B were 
allocated to 28-week on-demand treatment or randomized to 52 weeks of 
prophylaxis with 10 or 40 IU kg(-1) nonacog beta pegol administered every seven 
days. In the extension trial, patients could continue on the same treatment or 
switch to the alternate dosing regimen at any time. HRQoL was assessed with the 
HAEMO-QOL/HAEM-A-QOL age-specific questionnaires and the EQ-5D.
RESULTS: In the pivotal trial, adults receiving 40 IU kg(-1) prophylaxis 
reported significant improvements in the 'HAEM-A-QOL Total' score (-6.4 ± 8.5, P 
= 0.017) and in 'Sport' (-15.3 ± 8.5, P = 0.020), 'Feeling' (-15.2 ± 18.3, P = 
0.010) and 'Partnership' (-9.6 ± 15.5, P = 0.046) domain scores; no significant 
improvements were seen in the other arms. At the pivotal trial end, fewer 
patients reported problems in the EQ-5D 'Mobility' and 'Pain/Discomfort' 
dimensions, in particular those receiving prophylaxis. In the extension trial, 
adult patients switching from 10 to 40 IU kg(-1) prophylaxis showed significant 
improvements in 'HAEM-A-QOL Total' score (-12.5 ± 8.7, P = 0.016) and 'Physical 
health' domain (-23.1 ± 14.4, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with nonacog beta pegol 40 IU kg(-1) once 
weekly leads to HRQoL benefits in individuals with haemophilia B; this might be 
related to fewer bleeding episodes and higher FIX activity levels.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death 
worldwide, and its burden is expected to further increase in the next years. 
Chronic inflammation, induced by multiple viruses or metabolic alterations, and 
epigenetic and genetic modifications, cooperate in cancer development via a 
combination of common and distinct aetiology-specific pathways. In spite of the 
advances of classical therapies, the prognosis of this neoplasm has not 
considerably improved over the past few years. The advent of targeted therapies 
and the approval of the systemic treatment of advanced HCC with the kinase 
inhibitor sorafenib have provided some hope for the future. However, the 
benefits obtained from this treatment are still disappointing, as it extends the 
median life expectancy of patients by only few months. It is thus mandatory to 
find alternative effective treatments. Although the role played by thyroid 
hormones (THs) and their nuclear receptors (TRs) in human cancer is still 
unclear, mounting evidence indicates that they behave as oncosuppressors in HCC. 
However, the molecular mechanisms by which they exert this effect and the 
consequence of their activation following ligand binding on HCC progression 
remain elusive. In this review, we re-evaluate the existing evidence of the role 
of TH/TRs in HCC development; we will also discuss how TR alterations could 
affect fundamental biological processes, such as hepatocyte proliferation and 
differentiation, and consequently HCC progression. Finally, we will discuss if 
and how TRs can be foreseen as therapeutic targets in HCC and whether selective 
TR modulation by TH analogues may hold promise for HCC treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Being oriented toward the future has been associated with better 
future health. We studied associations of future orientation with life 
expectancy and the percentage of life with disability.
METHOD: We used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (n = 5249). Participants' 
average age in 1968 was 33.0. Six questions repeatedly measured future 
orientation, 1968-1976. Seven waves (1999-2011, 33,331 person-years) measured 
disability in activities of daily living for the same individuals, whose average 
age in 1999 was 64.0. We estimated monthly probabilities of disability and death 
with multinomial logistic Markov models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
childhood health, and education. Using the probabilities, we created large 
populations with microsimulation, measuring disability in each month for each 
individual, age 55 through death.
RESULTS: Life expectancy from age 55 for white men with high future orientation 
was age 77.6 (95% confidence interval 75.5-79.0), 6.9% (4.9-7.2) of those years 
with disability; results with low future orientation were 73.6 (72.2-75.4) and 
9.6% (7.7-10.7). Comparable results for African American men were 74.8 
(72.9-75.3), 8.1 (5.6-9.3), 71.0 (69.6-72.8), and 11.3 (9.1-11.7). For women, 
there were no significant differences associated with levels of future 
orientation for life expectancy. For white women with high future orientation 
9.1% of remaining life from age 55 was disabled (6.3-9.9), compared to 12.4% 
(10.2-13.2) with low future orientation. Disability results for African American 
women were similar but statistically significant only at age 80 and over.
CONCLUSION: High future orientation during early to middle adult ages may be 
associated with better health in older age.

The evolution of comprehensive haemophilia care in the United States: 
perspectives from the frontline.

The establishment of dedicated comprehensive treatment centres more than a half 
century ago transformed the management of haemophilia in the United States. 
Formerly, a disease associated with crippling disability and premature death, 
today, persons with haemophilia who are treated appropriately from infancy and 
do not develop inhibitors can expect a normal life expectancy and relatively few 
bleeding episodes. The evolution of the comprehensive haemophilia care, while 
chastened by the viral epidemics of the 1980s, has been marked by ongoing 
advances, including prophylaxis, immune tolerance induction, new drugs and gene 
therapy research. Current challenges include sustaining the comprehensive care 
model despite decreased funding and expanding the delivery and affordability of 
comprehensive haemophilia care.

BACKGROUND: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is the most effective 
intervention to prevent ovarian cancer (OC). It is only available to high-risk 
women with >10% lifetime OC risk. This threshold has not been formally tested 
for cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To specify the OC risk thresholds for RRSO being cost-effective for 
preventing OC in premenopausal women.
METHODS: The costs as well as effects of surgical prevention ('RRSO') were 
compared over a lifetime with 'no RRSO' using a decision analysis model. RRSO 
was undertaken in premenopausal women >40 years. The model was evaluated at 
lifetime OC risk levels: 2%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 8% and 10%. Costs and outcomes are 
discounted at 3.5%. Uncertainty in the model was assessed using both 
deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). 
Outcomes included in the analyses were OC, breast cancer (BC) and additional 
deaths from coronary heart disease. Total costs and effects were estimated in 
terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); incidence of OC and BC; as well as 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
DATA SOURCES: Published literature, Nurses Health Study, British National 
Formulary, Cancer Research UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidelines and National Health Service reference costs. The time horizon is 
lifetime and perspective: payer.
RESULTS: Premenopausal RRSO is cost-effective at 4% OC risk (life expectancy 
gained=42.7 days, ICER=£19 536/QALY) with benefits largely driven by reduction 
in BC risk. RRSO remains cost-effective at >8.2% OC risk without hormone 
replacement therapy (ICER=£29 071/QALY, life expectancy gained=21.8 days) or 
6%if BC risk reduction=0 (ICER=£27 212/QALY, life expectancy gained=35.3 days). 
Sensitivity analysis indicated results are not impacted much by costs of 
surgical prevention or treatment of OC/ BC or cardiovascular disease. However, 
results were sensitive to RRSO utility scores. Additionally, 37%, 61%, 74%, 84%, 
96% and 99.5% simulations on PSA are cost-effective for RRSO at the 2%, 4%, 5%, 
6%, 8% and 10% levels of OC risk, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Premenopausal RRSO appears to be extremely cost-effective at ≥4% 
lifetime OC risk, with ≥42.7 days gain in life expectancy if compliance with 
hormone replacement therapy is high. Current guidelines should be re-evaluated 
to reduce the RRSO OC risk threshold to benefit a number of at-risk women who 
presently cannot access risk-reducing surgery.

The differences between countries in national income, growth, human development 
and many other factors are used to classify countries into developed and 
developing countries. There are several classification systems that use 
different sets of measures and criteria. The most common classifications are the 
United Nations (UN) and the World Bank (WB) systems. The UN classification 
system uses the UN Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator that uses 
statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita for countries' 
classification. While the WB system uses gross national income (GNI) per capita 
that is calculated using the World Bank Atlas method. According to the UN and WB 
classification systems, there are 151 and 134 developing countries, 
respectively, with 89% overlap between the two systems. Developing countries 
have limited human development, and limited expenditure in education and 
research, among several other limitations. The biggest challenge facing genomic 
researchers and clinicians is limited resources. As a result, genomic tools, 
specifically genome sequencing technologies, which are rapidly becoming 
indispensable, are not widely available. In this report, we explore the current 
status of sequencing technologies in developing countries, describe the 
associated challenges and emphasize potential solutions.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Timely and 
appropriate treatment can reduce in-hospital mortality and morbidity.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
three tests [LightCycler SeptiFast Test MGRADE(®) (Roche Diagnostics, 
Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland); SepsiTest(TM) (Molzym Molecular Diagnostics, 
Bremen, Germany); and the IRIDICA BAC BSI assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Lake 
Forest, IL, USA)] for the rapid identification of bloodstream bacteria and fungi 
in patients with suspected sepsis compared with standard practice (blood culture 
with or without matrix-absorbed laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry).
DATA SOURCES: Thirteen electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The 
Cochrane Library) were searched from January 2006 to May 2015 and supplemented 
by hand-searching relevant articles.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness studies 
were conducted. A review of published economic analyses was undertaken and a de 
novo health economic model was constructed. A decision tree was used to estimate 
the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each test; all 
other parameters were estimated from published sources. The model was populated 
with evidence from the systematic review or individual studies, if this was 
considered more appropriate (base case 1). In a secondary analysis, estimates 
(based on experience and opinion) from seven clinicians regarding the benefits 
of earlier test results were sought (base case 2). A NHS and Personal Social 
Services perspective was taken, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% 
per annum. Scenario analyses were used to assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: For the review of diagnostic test accuracy, 62 studies of varying 
methodological quality were included. A meta-analysis of 54 studies comparing 
SeptiFast with blood culture found that SeptiFast had an estimated summary 
specificity of 0.86 [95% credible interval (CrI) 0.84 to 0.89] and sensitivity 
of 0.65 (95% CrI 0.60 to 0.71). Four studies comparing SepsiTest with blood 
culture found that SepsiTest had an estimated summary specificity of 0.86 (95% 
CrI 0.78 to 0.92) and sensitivity of 0.48 (95% CrI 0.21 to 0.74), and four 
studies comparing IRIDICA with blood culture found that IRIDICA had an estimated 
summary specificity of 0.84 (95% CrI 0.71 to 0.92) and sensitivity of 0.81 (95% 
CrI 0.69 to 0.90). Owing to the deficiencies in study quality for all 
interventions, diagnostic accuracy data should be treated with caution. No 
randomised clinical trial evidence was identified that indicated that any of the 
tests significantly improved key patient outcomes, such as mortality or duration 
in an intensive care unit or hospital. Base case 1 estimated that none of the 
three tests provided a benefit to patients compared with standard practice and 
thus all tests were dominated. In contrast, in base case 2 it was estimated that 
all cost per QALY-gained values were below £20,000; the IRIDICA BAC BSI assay 
had the highest estimated incremental net benefit, but results from base case 2 
should be treated with caution as these are not evidence based.
LIMITATIONS: Robust data to accurately assess the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the interventions are currently unavailable.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 
interventions cannot be reliably determined with the current evidence base. 
Appropriate studies, which allow information from the tests to be implemented in 
clinical practice, are required.

[PRESERVING FERTILITY AND FUTURE DEATH].

[Article in French]

Janny L, Pouly JL, Gremeau AS, Brugnon F.

The fertility preservation when it is threatened is a right enshrined in the 
french law on bioethics. It is most often performed before gonadotoxic 
treatments for cancers with a long survival. When the patient has a limited life 
expectancy, is the preservation of fertility lawful? The authors present the 
arguments for and against the preservation of fertility in this particular 
situation and give driving they adopt in their team.

These days, men suffer from a bad reputation when the media talk about health 
matters. Nonetheless, talking about men's health is problematic, as it considers 
the health behaviour of the male gender in an essentialistic manner. Such 
discourse is socially under-differentiated, frequently dramatises the gender 
difference rather than explaining it, makes inappropriate individualisations, 
draws on questionable benchmarks, makes women the positive model without first 
reflecting, and is ahistorical. Gender patterns have a major significance for 
health behaviour and have indeed considerably changed the health behaviour of 
men and women over the last 250 years. Women have been more seriously 
medicalised and have, on account of their life expectancy, profited more from 
modernisation, developments in hygiene, the expansion of medical services and 
state healthcare policies. However, over the last 30 years, besides a continuing 
parallel medicalisation of men, signs of it increasing can also be seen. Their 
behaviour has become more compatible with health. A more adequate description of 
the situation could be achieved through a more concentrated observation of 
health lifestyles.

Life expectancy in Israel has risen by almost 6 years during the last 25 years, 
and the proportion of people 65 years of age or older is expected to reach 12 % 
of the total population by 2020. A substantial increase in the workload for 
Otolaryngologists and Head and Neck surgeons is anticipated. Our goal was to 
characterize the admissions of patients 80 years of age and older to the 
Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery in a tertiary medical 
center. The study group included all patients 80 years of age and older who were 
admitted to the Department of OTOHNS in our institute between 2009 and 2013. 
There were two control groups for comparison divided by age; one group 
40-59 years old and the other group 60-79 years old. There were 385 admissions 
of 317 patients aged 80-103 years (4.2 % of overall admissions). Over the study 
period, admissions of patients over 80 years increased on average by 3 % per 
annum (p = 0.4), and those patients over 90 years old by 52 % per annum 
(p < 0.001). The most common indication was HN malignancy (28.8 %) followed by 
otologic disorders (22.0 %). Of the overall 158 operations conducted, 131 
patients (82.9 %) underwent elective procedures (mainly oncology) and 27 
patients (17.1 %) underwent emergent procedures. The distribution of the reasons 
for admission of the patients older than 80 years is surprisingly different from 
that of the "younger" patients. With life expectancy rising, our study predicts 
a workload increase mainly in the HN oncologic and otologic services.

OBJECTIVE: This relative study includes categorical exploration of the 
economics, demographic, political, social and financial data to realize the 
basic reasons of the present healthcare systems in these countries.
METHODS: Descriptive and comparative methods were used. This study tries to 
relate the healthcare systems of Jordan with that of France to produce effective 
lessons that can be helpful for guiding future developments down the correct 
path.
RESULTS: Depending on many factors such as life expectancy, the mortality rate 
in infants, universal medical coverage and availability of healthcare services 
to the masses, significant disparities between the two systems were found.
CONCLUSION: Through this study, it has been concluded that the healthcare system 
of Jordan has a lot to improve with regard to standards of services offered, and 
there are many aspects to be learned from the French healthcare system by the 
Jordanian one, including the healthcare coverage system and the cost-sharing 
strategies.
