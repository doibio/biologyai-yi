The prevalence of hypertension has been decreasing in Japan due to improved 
medical treatment and a decrease in dietary salt intake. However, disparities in 
the prevalence, treatment, and control of hypertension are expected to occur in 
different regions. This study aimed to investigate the trends in the prevalence, 
treatment, and control of hypertension at the prefectural level of life 
expectancy among Japanese population. We used data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Survey and analysed the individual survey information of individuals 
aged 40-69 years by dividing it into six terms, i.e., 1995-1997, 1999-2001, 
2003-2005, 2007-2009, 2012, and 2016. Prefectures were classified into four 
groups according to their 40-year-old life expectancy in 2000. Outcome values 
were standardised to the population by 10-year age groups in 2010, and they were 
tested by two-way analysis of variance according to six terms and life 
expectancies. The prevalence of hypertension tended to decrease, especially 
among women, whereas the treatment and control tended to improve from the first 
to the sixth period in both men and women. The prevalence and treatment of 
hypertension in men with longer life expectancy tended to be lower than that in 
other groups, and there was no obvious difference in the control. In women, 
there were no obvious differences in the prevalence, treatment, or control. 
Reducing the prevalence of hypertension by improving lifestyle factors, such as 
high salt intake in each prefecture with a relatively short life expectancy, may 
be important to resolve the disparity in life expectancy among prefectures.

The establishment of national neonatal screening systems has resulted in 
improved quality of life and life expectancy in patients with phenylketonuria 
(PKU). This has led to the development of multidisciplinary treatment units for 
adult patients with PKU. We present a retrospective descriptive study of a 
cohort of 90 adult patients (>16 years) with PKU under active follow-up in two 
reference centers in Andalusia. We analyzed disease severity, treatment type, 
demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, vitamin and hormone 
profiles, and bone metabolism. The median (interquartile range)age was 29 
(23−38) years, 47 (52.2%) were women and 43 (47.8%) were men. Eighty (88.9%) had 
classical PKU, five (5.6%) moderate PKU, and five (5.6%) mild PKU. Diagnosis was 
by neonatal screening in 62 (68.9%) of the patients. The rest had late 
diagnosis. Treatment with sapropterin was given to 18 (20%) patients and diet 
and nutrition therapy to 72 (80%). There was adequate metabolic control 
according to Phe levels in 43 (47.78%) patients. Body mass index was 26.61 
(22.7−31.1) kg/m2. Twenty-six (29.2%) patients had obesity, 7 (7.9%) 
hypertension, 2 (2.2%) type 2 diabetes, 26 (28.89%) dyslipidemia, 14 (15.6%) 
elevated total cholesterol, 9 (15.8%) decreased high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol and 16 (17.8%) hypertriglyceridemia. Seven (10.3%) patients had 
osteoporosis and 28 (41.17%) osteopenia. Twenty-six (30.6%) had vitamin D (25OH) 
deficiency and four (4.5%) vitamin B12 deficiency. Although we observed no 
differences with most vascular risk factors, we found a high prevalence of 
obesity in relation to the age of the cohort. A continued evaluation of 
comorbidities in these patients is therefore needed, despite adequate metabolic 
control.

The field of membrane materials is one of the most dynamic due to the 
continuously changing requirements regarding the selectivity and the upgradation 
of the materials developed with the constantly changing needs. Two membrane 
processes are essential at present, not for development, but for everyday 
life-desalination and hemodialysis. Hemodialysis has preserved life and 
increased life expectancy over the past 60-70 years for tens of millions of 
people with chronic kidney dysfunction. In addition to the challenges related to 
the efficiency and separative properties of the membranes, the biggest challenge 
remained and still remains the assurance of hemocompatibility-not affecting the 
blood during its recirculation outside the body for 4 h once every two days. 
This review presents the latest research carried out in the field of 
functionalization of polysulfone membranes (the most used polymer in the 
preparation of membranes for hemodialysis) with the purpose of increasing the 
hemocompatibility and efficiency of the separation process itself with a 
decreasing impact on the body.

Over the last decades, the global life expectancy of the population has 
increased, and so, consequently, has the risk of cancer development. Despite the 
improvement in cancer therapies (e.g., drug delivery systems (DDS) and 
theranostics), in many cases recurrence continues to be a challenging issue. In 
this matter, the development of nanotechnology has led to an array of 
possibilities for cancer treatment. One of the most promising therapies focuses 
on the assembly of hierarchical structures in the form of nanoclusters, as this 
approach involves preparing individual building blocks while avoiding handling 
toxic chemicals in the presence of biomolecules. This review aims at presenting 
an overview of the major advances made in developing nanoclusters based on 
polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) and/or inorganic NPs. The preparation methods and 
the features of the NPs used in the construction of the nanoclusters were 
described. Afterwards, the design, fabrication and properties of the two main 
classes of nanoclusters, namely noble-metal nanoclusters and hybrid (i.e., 
hetero) nanoclusters and their mode of action in cancer therapy, were 
summarized.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since 2015, platelet products have been 
pathogen-inactivated (PI) at the Luxemburgish Red Cross (LRC) using Riboflavin 
and UV light (RF-PI). As the LRC should respond to hospital needs at any time, 
platelet production exceeds the demand, generating a discard rate of 18%. To 
reduce this, we consider the extension of storage time from 5 to 7 days. This 
study's objective was to evaluate the in vitro 7-day platelet-storage quality, 
comparing two PI technologies, RF-PI and amotosalen/UVA light (AM-PI), for 
platelet pools from whole-blood donations (PPCs) and apheresis platelets 
collected from single apheresis donation (APCs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each product type, 6 double-platelet concentrates 
were prepared and divided into 2 units; one was treated with RF-PI and the other 
by AM-PI. In vitro platelet-quality parameters were tested pre- and post-PI, at 
days 5 and 7.
RESULTS: Treatment and storage lesions were observed in PPCs and APCs with both 
PI methods. We found a higher rate of lactate increase and glucose depletion, 
suggesting a stronger stimulation of the glycolytic pathway, a higher Annexin V 
binding, and a loss of swirling in the RF-PI-treated units from day 5. The 
platelet loss was significantly higher in the AM-PI compared with the RF-PI 
units.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that RF-PI treatment has a higher deleterious 
impact on in vitro platelet quality compared to AM-PI, but we observed higher 
loss of platelets with AM-PI due to the post-illumination amotosalen adsorption 
step. If 7-day storage is needed, it can only be achieved with AM-PI, based on 
our quality criteria.

Targeted drug conjugates based on Affibody molecules fused to an albumin-binding 
domain (ABD) for half-life extension have demonstrated potent anti-tumor 
activity in preclinical therapeutic studies. Furthermore, optimization of their 
molecular design might increase the cytotoxic effect on tumors and minimize 
systemic toxicity. This study aimed to investigate the influence of length and 
composition of a linker between the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-targeted affibody molecule (ZHER2:2891) and the ABD domain on 
functionality and biodistribution of affibody-drug conjugates containing a 
microtubulin inhibitor mertansin (mcDM1) (AffiDCs). Two conjugates, having a 
trimeric (S3G)3 linker or a trimeric (G3S)3 linker were produced, radiolabeled 
with 99mTc(CO)3, and compared side-by-side in vitro and in vivo with the 
original ZHER2:2891-G4S-ABD-mcDM1 conjugate having a monomeric G4S linker. Both 
conjugates with longer linkers had a decreased affinity to HER2 and mouse and 
human serum albumin in vitro, however, no differences in blood retention were 
observed in NMRI mice up to 24 h post injection. The use of both (S3G)3 and 
(G3S)3 linkers reduced liver uptake of AffiDCs by approximately 1.2-fold 
compared with the use of a G4S linker. This finding provides important insights 
into the molecular design for the development of targeted drug conjugates with 
reduced hepatic uptake.

An easy, inexpensive, and rapid method to identify microorganisms is in great 
demand in various areas such as medical diagnostics or in the food industry. In 
our study, we show the development of several predictive models based on Raman 
spectroscopy combined with support vector machines (SVM) for 21 species of 
microorganisms. The microorganisms, grown under standardized conditions, were 
placed on a silver mirror slide to record the data for model development. 
Additional data was obtained from microorganisms on a polished stainless-steel 
slide in order to validate the models in general and to assess possible negative 
influences of the material change on the predictions. The theoretical prediction 
accuracies for the most accurate models, based on a five-fold cross-validation, 
are 98.4%. For practical validation, new spectra (from stainless-steel surfaces) 
have been used, which were not included in the calibration data set. The overall 
prediction accuracy in practice was about 80% and the inaccurate predictions 
were only due to a few species. The development of a database provides the basis 
for further investigations such as the application and extension to single-cell 
analytics and for the characterization of biofilms.

The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has become a 
grave concern worldwide. In this study, 95 strains of S. aureus isolated from 
stool samples were collected from Busan, South Korea to characterize their 
antimicrobial susceptibility, enterotoxin genes, and molecular typing using 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay. Only 
two strains showed no drug resistance, whereas resistance to three or more 
antibiotics was observed in 87.4% of strains. Ampicillin resistance was the most 
common at 90% and all strains were susceptible to vancomycin. The distribution 
of enterotoxin genes encoded in isolates was sea (32.6%), sec (11.6%), seg 
(19%), sea & sec (2.1%), and sec & seg (34.7%). Molecular typing using both 
MALDI-TOF MS and RAPD indicated that S. aureus exhibited diverse clonal lineages 
and no correlations were observed among the profiling of enterotoxin, MALDI-TOF 
MS, and RAPD. This investigation provides useful information on foodborne 
pathogenic S. aureus that has a significant public health impact in South Korea.

Human health risk and phytoremediation of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) in the 
edible vegetables have been widely discussed recently. This study aimed to 
determine the concentrations of four PTMs, namely Cd, Fe, Ni, and Zn) in 
Amaranthus viridis (leaves, stems, and roots) collected from 11 sampling sites 
in Peninsular Malaysia and to assess their human health risk (HHR). In general, 
the metal levels followed the order: roots > stems > leaves. The metal 
concentrations (µg/g) in the leaves of A. viridis ranged from 0.45 to 2.18 dry 
weight (dw) (0.05−0.26 wet weight (ww)), 74.8 to 535 dw (8.97−64.2 ww), 2.02 to 
7.45 dw (0.24−0.89 ww), and 65.2 to 521 dw (7.83−62.6 ww), for Cd, Fe, Ni, and 
Zn, respectively. The positive relationships between the metals, the plant 
parts, and the geochemical factions of their habitat topsoils indicated the 
potential of A. viridis as a good biomonitor of Cd, Fe, and Ni pollution. With 
most of the values of the bioconcentration factor (BCF) > 1.0 and the transfer 
factor (TF) > 1.0, A. viridis was a very promising phytoextraction agent of Ni 
and Zn. Additionally, with most of the values of BCF > 1.0 and TF < 1.0, A. 
viridis was a very promising phytostabiliser of Cd and Fe. With respect to HHR, 
the target hazard quotients (THQ) for Cd, Fe, Pb, and Zn in the leaves of A. 
viridis were all below 1.00, indicating there were no non-carcinogenic risks of 
the four metals to consumers, including children and adults. Nevertheless, 
routine monitoring of PTMs in Amaranthus farms is much needed.

Salmonella enterica serovar Newport bacteriophage 7-11 shares 41 homologous ORFs 
with Escherichia coli phage phiEco32, and both phages encode a protein similar 
to bacterial RNA polymerase promoter specificity σ subunit. Here, we 
investigated the temporal pattern of 7-11 gene expression during infection and 
compared it to the previously determined transcription strategy of phiEco32. 
Using primer extension and in vitro transcription assays, we identified eight 
promoters recognized by host RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing 7-11 σ subunit 
SaPh711_gp47. These promoters are characterized by a bipartite consensus, 
GTAAtg-(16)-aCTA, and are located upstream of late phage genes. While dissimilar 
from single-element middle and late promoters of phiEco32 recognized by 
holoenzymes formed by the phi32_gp36 σ factor, the 7-11 late promoters are 
located at genome positions similar to those of phiEco32 middle and late 
promoters. Two early 7-11 promoters are recognized by the RNA polymerase 
holoenzyme containing the host primary σ70 factor. Unlike the case of phiEco32, 
no shut-off of σ70-dependent transcription is observed during 7-11 infection and 
there are no middle promoters. These differences can be explained by the fact 
that phage 7-11 does not encode a homologue of phi32_gp79, an inhibitor of host 
and early phage transcription and an activator of transcription by the 
phi32_gp36-holoenzyme.

Women's health is an imminent concern worldwide, but it remains an ignored 
segment of research in most developing countries, and is yet to take the center 
stage in even developed nations. Some exclusive female health concerns revolve 
around both pathological and physiological aspects. These gender-specific 
maladies include breast, cervical, and ovarian cancers, and physiological 
concerns such as menopause and osteoporosis, which are often coexistent. 
Recently, women's health issues, including postmenopausal syndrome, have 
attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners alike, opening newer 
pharmaceutical research and clinical avenues. Although not counted as a disease, 
postmenopausal syndrome (PMS) is a female health phenomenon underpinned by 
hormonal depletion. Enhanced life expectancy in women has added to their 
suffering, and pharmacological interventions are needed. Amongst the available 
treatment modalities, the use of numerous botanicals has emerged as an efficient 
health management tool for women. Cimicifuga racemosa (CR or Black Cohosh) is a 
plant/herb which has been traditionally exploited and extensively used by women. 
This review is an attempt to compile and provide a summary of the importance of 
CR in complementary and alternative therapies for the improvement of various 
disorders related to women, such as menopausal syndrome, mammary cancer, and 
osteoporosis. It aims to systematically highlight the bioactive constituents, 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic potentials, quality control 
processes, chromatographic techniques, and possible mechanisms of action of 
clinically effective phytomedicine for women's health. Various clinical trials 
and patents relating to CR and women's health have been collated. Furthermore, 
the plant and its related products have been considered from a regulatory 
perspective to reveal its commercial feasibility. The present review summarizes 
the existing data on CR focusing on women's health, which can help to introduce 
this traditional phytomedicine to the world and provide some reference for 
future drug development.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the gap in life expectancy by educational level in the 
city of Barcelona from 2004 to 2018 and to decompose this gap by age and causes 
of death.
METHOD: We computed abridged life tables at the age of 25 years by sex from 2004 
to 2018 using standard methods. Educational level was categorised in two groups 
(lower secondary or less vs. upper secondary or higher education). The life 
expectancy gap was further decomposed by age and by causes of death based in 
Arriaga's method in 5-year age blocks up to the age of ≥ 90 years and broad 
causes of death using ICD-10 codes.
RESULTS: The life expectancy gap at 25 years by educational level oscillated 
without trend at around 3.08 years for men and 1.93 years for women. 
Decomposition by age showed a favourable significant shift in the contribution 
to this gap from young to older ages for men, with few changes for women. 
Decomposition by causes of death showed that the diseases concentrating the 
largest share of the contribution were neoplasms and respiratory and circulatory 
disease. There was a significant downward trend in external causes for men and 
in infectious diseases for both men and women but a significant upward trend for 
respiratory disease for both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: The stability of the life expectancy gap by educational level 
during the period analysed resulted from a combination of divergent trends by 
age and causes of death among high and low educational levels.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) may lead to 
walking disability. The effect of regaining gait ability on the life expectancy 
of cancer patients is still unknown. To explore this issue, we evaluated the 
effect of gait ability recovery in nonambulatory patients after treatment for a 
metastatic spinal tumor.
METHODS: In total, 105 patients who underwent surgery for MESCC between January 
2006 and December 2016 and survived longer than 3 months were enrolled. All the 
patients were nonambulatory because of the MESCC and had undergone posterior 
decompression and fixation with intraoperative radiotherapy. At postoperative 
month 3, patients who had regained their gait ability were categorized as 
ambulatory and those who had not were categorized as nonambulatory. Age, sex, 
prognosis score (modified Bauer score), preoperative and postoperative Frankel 
grade scores, tumor origin site, Charlson comorbidity index, and survival time 
were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients regained gait ability at postoperative month 3, 
and 33 patients did not. The modified Bauer score did not differ between the 
groups (P = 0.08); therefore, the presumptive life expectancy of the groups 
before treatment was not biased. The median survival time was significantly 
longer in the ambulatory group (610 days) than that in the nonambulatory group 
(181 days, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who regained their gait ability after treatment for MESCC 
tended to live longer than those who did not, indicating that recovery of gait 
ability by patients with cancer is associated with improved life expectancy.

Comment in
    Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2022 Jun;6(6):354-355.

BACKGROUND: Disability and mortality burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
have risen worldwide; however, the NCD burden among adolescents remains poorly 
described in the EU.
METHODS: Estimates were retrieved from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. Causes of NCDs were analysed at three 
different levels of the GBD 2019 hierarchy, for which mortality, years of life 
lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) were extracted. Estimates, with the 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UI), were retrieved for EU Member States from 1990 to 2019, three age subgroups 
(10-14 years, 15-19 years, and 20-24 years), and by sex. Spearman's correlation 
was conducted between DALY rates for NCDs and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) 
of each EU Member State.
FINDINGS: In 2019, NCDs accounted for 86·4% (95% uncertainty interval 83·5-88·8) 
of all YLDs and 38·8% (37·4-39·8) of total deaths in adolescents aged 10-24 
years. For NCDs in this age group, neoplasms were the leading causes of both 
mortality (4·01 [95% uncertainty interval 3·62-4·25] per 100 000 population) and 
YLLs (281·78 [254·25-298·92] per 100 000 population), whereas mental disorders 
were the leading cause for YLDs (2039·36 [1432·56-2773·47] per 100 000 
population) and DALYs (2040·59 [1433·96-2774·62] per 100 000 population) in all 
EU Member States, and in all studied age groups. In 2019, among adolescents aged 
10-24 years, males had a higher mortality rate per 100 000 population due to 
NCDs than females (11·66 [11·04-12·28] vs 7·89 [7·53-8·23]), whereas females 
presented a higher DALY rate per 100 000 population due to NCDs (8003·25 
[5812·78-10 701·59] vs 6083·91 [4576·63-7857·92]). From 1990 to 2019, mortality 
rate due to NCDs in adolescents aged 10-24 years substantially decreased 
(-40·41% [-43·00 to -37·61), and also the YLL rate considerably decreased 
(-40·56% [-43·16 to -37·74]), except for mental disorders (which increased by 
32·18% [1·67 to 66·49]), whereas the YLD rate increased slightly (1·44% [0·09 to 
2·79]). Positive correlations were observed between DALY rates and SDIs for 
substance use disorders (rs=0·58, p=0·0012) and skin and subcutaneous diseases 
(rs=0·45, p=0·017), whereas negative correlations were found between DALY rates 
and SDIs for cardiovascular diseases (rs=-0·46, p=0·015), neoplasms (rs=-0·57, 
p=0·0015), and sense organ diseases (rs=-0·61, p=0·0005).
INTERPRETATION: NCD-related mortality has substantially declined among 
adolescents in the EU between 1990 and 2019, but the rising trend of YLL 
attributed to mental disorders and their YLD burden are concerning. Differences 
by sex, age group, and across EU Member States highlight the importance of 
preventive interventions and scaling up adolescent-responsive health-care 
systems, which should prioritise specific needs by sex, age, and location.

OBJECTIVES: Health interventions for patients can also affect the health of 
their informal carers and family members. These changes in carer or family 
member health could be reflected in cost-utility analyses (CUAs) through the 
inclusion of their quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We conducted a 
systematic review to identify and describe all CUAs that have included family 
member health-related QALYs.
METHODS: A total of 4 bibliographic databases were searched from inception to 
July 2021. A 2-stage sifting process for inclusion of studies was undertaken. We 
performed data extraction using a standardized data extraction form and 
performed a narrative synthesis of the evidence.
RESULTS: A total of 40 CUAs published between 1999 and 2021 were identified. 
CUAs were conducted in 15 different countries. CUAs examined 13 different 
conditions including 15 CUAs on vaccination, 5 on Alzheimer's disease, 2 on 
Parkinson's disease, 3 on dementia, and 2 on terminal illness. The EQ-5D was the 
most commonly used measure of family member health. Generally, including carer 
QALYs resulted in lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: When considering the total number of economic evaluations 
published, few have included family member QALYs and the methods for doing so 
are often inconsistent and data sources often limited. Estimation of family 
member QALYs in patient CUAs was regularly uncertain and often substantial in 
magnitude. The findings highlight the variation among methods and call for 
greater consistency in methods for incorporating family member QALYs in patient 
CUAs.

BACKGROUND: Trichoderma reesei has extraordinary potential for high-level 
protein production at large scales, and it need to be further explored through 
genetic engineering tools to obtain a thorough understanding of its cellular 
physiology. Understanding the genetic factors involved in the intrinsic 
regulatory network is crucial; without this information, there would be 
restrictions in expressing genes of interest. Past and present studies are 
concentrated on the application and expansion of novel expression systems using 
synthetic biology concepts. These approaches involve either using previously 
established promoters that are strong or genetically engineered promoters. 
Genomic and transcriptomic methods have also been employed to isolate strong 
promoters and expression systems such as light-inducible expression systems, 
copper-inducible expression systems, L-methionine inducible promoters, and 
Tet-On expression system etc. AIMS OF REVIEW: In this review, we will highlight 
various research endeavors related to tunable and constitutive promoters; the 
role of different promoters in homologous and heterologous protein expression; 
the identification of innovative promoters, and strategies that may be 
beneficial for future research aimed at improving and enhancing protein 
expression in T. reesei.
KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF THE REVIEW: The characterization of new promoters and 
implementation of novel expression systems that will result in a significant 
extension of the molecular toolbox that is accessible for the genetic 
engineering of innovative strains of T. reesei. Genetically engineered strong 
inducible promoters such as Pcbh1 through replacement of transcriptional 
repressors (cre1, ace1) with transcriptional activators (xyr1, ace2, ace3, 
hap2/3/5) and synthetic expression systems can result in elevated production of 
endoglucanases (EGLs), β-glucosidases (BGLs), and cellobiohydrolases (CBHs). 
Strong constitutive promoters such as Pcdna1 can be converted into genetically 
engineered synthetic hybrid promoters by integrating the activation region of 
strong inducible promoters, which can allow the induction and expression of 
cellulases even on repressing media. More efforts are necessary to identify 
innovative promoters and novel expression strategies for the enhanced expression 
of desirable proteins at industrial scales.

How I Manage Patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): Perspectives from 
Clinical Practice.

WI, USA.

The management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has remarkably changed in the 
last 20 years with the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Most 
patients with chronic phase CML now have a life expectancy like that of age 
matched controls. Understanding the practical aspects of choosing the 
appropriate TKI, monitoring response and side-effects are key to long term 
success. Currently, treatment cessation is also an option in patients achieving 
sustained deep molecular response. Novel agents are needed in patients with lack 
of response to TKI and in those with advanced disease.

Viral Law: Life, Death, Difference, and Indifference from the Spanish Flu to 
Covid-19.

Featherstone M(1).

Author information:
(1)Sociology, Keele University, Staffordshire, ST55BG UK.

What is viral law? In order to being my discussion, I note that the last two 
years have been extremely difficult to understand and that we, meaning those who 
have lived through the pandemic, have struggled to make sense. Thus, I make the 
argument that the virus has impacted upon not only the individual's ability to 
make sense in a world where every day routines have been upended, but also 
social and political structures that similarly rely on repetition to continue to 
function. According to this thesis, Covid-19 is more than simply a biological 
organism, but also a cultural virus that undermines the organisation of social, 
political, and economic systems and requires new ways of thinking about how we 
might move forward into a post-Covid world. In the name of beginning this 
project of making sense of Covid-19, I track back in history to the comparable 
reference point of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920 and, in particular, a 
reading of Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle, which the founder of 
psychoanalysis wrote in the shadow of the virus. In reading Freud's attempt to 
write a psychology of death in the context of this funereal period of history, I 
argue that he set out first, a mythological theory of viral law concerned with 
the death drive, before turning to second, a techno-scientific, biological 
theory of the same (viral) law characterised by microbial immortality. Beyond 
this exploration of Beyond the Pleasure Principle, in the third part of the 
article I turn to a reading of Lacan's interpretation of Freud's work, where 
viral law becomes a story of cybernetics and nihilistic mechanisation. Here, 
perfect mechanisation, and the endless oscillation between message and noise, 
looks a lot like living death. Finally, I take up Derrida's critique of Jacob's 
molecular biology and, by extension, Freud's theory of microbial immorality, 
that he thinks privileges an idea of repetitive sameness and opens up a space 
for cultural politics concerned with immunity against otherness. Derrida's key 
point here is that this biological fantasy ignores the reality of viral sex that 
enables evolution to happen. What this means is that the other, even in its 
microbial form, is ever present, and that we must recognise the importance of 
difference to the possibility of social, political, and economic change.

The collapse is the most frequent and harmful geological hazard during the 
construction of the shallow buried tunnel, which seriously threatens the life 
and property safety of construction personnel. To realize the process control of 
collapse in the tunnel construction, a three-stage risk evaluation method of 
collapse in the whole construction process of shallow tunnels was put forward. 
Firstly, according to the engineering geology and hydrogeology information 
obtained in the prospecting stage, a fuzzy model of preliminary risk evaluation 
based on disaster-pregnant environment factors was proposed to provide a 
reference for the optimization design of construction and support schemes in the 
design stage. Secondly, the disaster-pregnant environment factors were corrected 
based on the obtained information, such as advanced geological forecast and 
geological sketch, and the disaster-causing factors were introduced. An 
extension theory model of secondary risk evaluation was established to guide the 
reasonable excavation and primary support schemes. Finally, the 
disaster-pregnant and disaster-causing factors were corrected according to the 
excavation condition, an attribute model of final risk evaluation for the 
collapse was constructed combined with the mechanical response index of the 
surrounding rock. Meanwhile, the risk acceptance criteria and construction 
decision-making method of the collapse in the shallow buried tunnels were 
formulated to efficiently implement the multi-level risk control of this hazard. 
The proposed method has been successfully applied to the Huangjiazhuang tunnel 
of the South Shandong High-Speed Railway. The comparison showed that the 
evaluation results are highly consistent for these practical situations, which
