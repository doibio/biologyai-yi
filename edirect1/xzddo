PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the novel M6-C compressible 
artificial cervical disc compared with ACDF for subjects with single-level 
degenerative cervical radiculopathy.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective, multicenter, concurrently and historically 
controlled, FDA-approved investigational device exemption clinical trial.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Subjects with one-level symptomatic degenerative cervical 
radiculopathy were enrolled and assigned to receive M6-C or ACDF.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain and function (Neck Disability Index, VAS), quality of 
life (SF-36), safety, neurologic, and radiographic assessments of motion (both 
flexion extension and lateral bending) were performed. The primary clinical 
endpoint was composite clinical success (CCS) at 24 months.
METHODS: Using propensity score subclassification to control for selection bias, 
160 M6-C subjects were compared to a matched subset of 189 ACDF controls (46 
concurrent and 143 historical controls).
RESULTS: Both ACDF and M6-C subjects reported significant improvements in 
patient-reported outcomes at all time points over baseline. Overall SF-36 
Physical Component Score and neck and arm pain scores were significantly 
improved for M6-C as compared to ACDF treatment. CCS and mean Neck Disability 
Index improvements were similar between M6-C and ACDF. Correspondingly, there 
were significantly fewer subjects that utilized pain medication or opioids 
following M6-C treatment at 24 months relative to baseline. Range of motion was 
maintained in subjects treated with M6-C. Subsequent surgical interventions, 
dysphagia rates, and serious adverse events were comparable between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: M6-C treatment demonstrated both safety and effectiveness for the 
treatment of degenerative cervical radiculopathy. Treatment with M6-C 
demonstrated noninferiority for the primary endpoint, indicating a similar 
ability to achieve CCS at 24 months. However, for the secondary endpoints, M6-C 
subjects demonstrated significantly improved pain and function compared to ACDF 
subjects, while maintaining range of motion, improving quality of life, and 
decreasing analgesic and opioid usage at 2 years postoperatively relative to 
baseline.

Digital Twin technology has been rising in popularity thanks to the popularity 
of machine learning in the last decade. As the life expectancy of people around 
the world is increasing, so is the focus on physical activity to remain healthy 
especially in the current times where people are staying sedentary while in 
quarantine. This article aims to provide a survey on the field of Digital Twin 
technology focusing on machine learning and coaching techniques as they have not 
been explored yet. We also define what Digital Twin Coaching is and categorize 
the work done so far in terms of the objective of the physical activity. We also 
list common Digital Twin Coaching characteristics found in the articles reviewed 
in terms of concepts such as interactivity, privacy and security and also detail 
future perspectives in multimodal interaction and standardization, to name a 
few, that can guide researchers if they choose to work in this field. Finally, 
we provide a diagram for the Digital Twin Ecosystem showing the interaction 
between relevant entities and the information flow as well as an idealization of 
an ideal Digital Twin Ecosystem for team sports' athlete tracking.

Determining the ideal ratio of macronutrients for increasing life expectancy 
remains a high priority in nutrition research. We aim to investigate the 
association between carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake and all-cause 
mortality in Koreans. This cohort study investigated 42,192 participants from 
the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) linked with 
causes of death data (2007-2015). Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using the 
multivariable Cox proportional regression model after adjusting for confounders. 
We documented 2110 deaths during the follow-up period. Time to exceed 1% of the 
all-cause mortality rate was longest in participants with 50-60% carbohydrate, 
30-40% fat, and 20-30% protein intake. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) was 1.313 (1.031-1.672, p = 0.0272) for <50% 
carbohydrate intake, 1.322 (1.116-1.567, p = 0.0013) for ≥60% carbohydrate 
intake, 1.439 (1.018-2.035, p = 0.0394) for <30% fat intake, and 3.255 
(1.767-5.997, p = 0.0002) for ≥40% fat intake. There was no significant 
association between protein intake proportion and all-cause mortality. We found 
a U-shaped association between all-cause mortality and carbohydrate intake as 
well as fat intake, with minimal risk observed at 50-60% carbohydrate and 30-40% 
fat intake. Our findings suggest current Korean dietary guidelines should be 
revised to prolong life expectancy.

The ascomycete Trichoderma atroviride is well known for its mycoparasitic 
lifestyle. Similar to other organisms, light is an important cue for T. 
atroviride. However, besides triggering of conidiation, little is known on the 
physiological responses of T. atroviride to light. In this study, we analyzed 
how cultivation under different light wavelengths and regimes impacted the 
behavior of two T. atroviride wild-type strains: IMI206040 and P1. While colony 
extension of both strains was slightly affected by light, massive differences in 
their photoconidation responses became evident. T. atroviride P1 colonies 
conidiated under all conditions tested including growth in complete darkness, 
while IMI206040 required white, blue or green light to trigger asexual 
reproduction. Interestingly, deletion of the stress-activated MAP 
kinase-encoding gene tmk3 abolished the ability of strain P1 to conidiate in red 
and yellow light as well as in darkness. Furthermore, light-dependent 
differences in the mycoparasitic activity and in the biosynthesis of the 
secondary metabolite 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6-PP) became evident. 6-PP production 
was highest upon dark incubation, while light, especially exposure to white 
light as light/dark cycles, had an inhibitory effect on its biosynthesis. We 
conclude that the response of T. atroviride to light is strain-dependent and 
impacts differentiation, mycoparasitism, and 6-PP production; hence, this should 
be considered in experiments testing the mycoparasitic activity of these fungi.

Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection is a global health issue since 
neither a cure nor a vaccine is available. However, the highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the life expectancy for patients 
with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs) are in almost all HAART and target reverse transcriptase 
(RT), an essential enzyme for the virus. Even though NRTIs are highly effective, 
they have limitations caused by RT resistance. The main mechanisms of RT 
resistance to NRTIs are discrimination and excision. Understanding the molecular 
mechanisms for discrimination and excision are essential to develop more potent 
and selective NRTIs. Using protein X-ray crystallography, we determined the 
first crystal structure of RT in its post-catalytic state in complex with 
emtricitabine, (-)FTC or stavudine (d4T). Our structural studies provide the 
framework for understanding how RT discriminates between NRTIs and natural 
nucleotides, and for understanding the requirement of (-)FTC to undergo a 
conformation change for successful incorporation by RT. The crystal structure of 
RT in post-catalytic complex with d4T provides a "snapshot" for considering the 
possible mechanism of how RT develops resistance for d4T via excision. The 
findings reported herein will contribute to the development of next generation 
NRTIs.

BACKGROUND: Economic evaluation of school-based obesity interventions could 
provide support for public health decision of obesity prevention. This study is 
to perform cost-utility and cost-benefit assessment of three school-based 
childhood obesity interventions including nutrition education intervention (NE), 
physical activity intervention (PA) and comprehensive intervention (both NE and 
PA, CNP) with secondary data analysis of one randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: The standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods were employed from a 
societal perspective to the health outcome and costs that are attributable to 
the intervention. NE, PA and CNP were carried out separately for 2 semesters for 
childhood obesity interventions in primary schools. The additional 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from the interventions were 
measured as the health outcome. A cost-utility ratio (CUR) and A cost-benefit 
ratio (CBR) was calculated as the ratio of implementation costs to the total 
medical and productivity loss costs averted by the interventions.
RESULTS: The CUR and CBR were ¥11,505.9 ($1646.0) per QALY and ¥1.2 benefit per 
¥1 cost respectively, and the net saving was ¥73,659.6 ($10,537.9). The CUR and 
CBR for nutrition education and physical activity interventions were ¥21,316.4 
($3049.6) per QALY and ¥0.7 benefit per ¥1 cost, ¥28,417.1 ($4065.4) per QALY 
and ¥0.4 benefit per ¥1 cost, respectively (in 2019 RMB). Compared with PA 
intervention, the ICERs were ¥10,335.2 ($1478.6) and 4626.3 ($661.8) for CNP and 
NE respectively. The CBR was ¥1.2, 0.7, and 0.4 benefits per ¥1 cost for CNP, 
NE, and PA interventions, respectively. Net estimated savings were achieved only 
through CNP intervention, amounting to ¥73,659.6 ($10,537.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive school-based obesity intervention is a beneficial 
investment that is both cost-effective and cost saving. Compared with PA 
intervention, both CNP and NE intervention were more cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between autocratisation-substantial decreases 
in democratic traits (free and fair elections, freedom of civil and political 
association, and freedom of expression)-and countries' population health 
outcomes and progress toward universal health coverage (UHC).
DESIGN: Synthetic control analysis.
SETTING AND COUNTRY SELECTION: Global sample of countries for all years from 
1989 to 2019, split into two categories: 17 treatment countries that started 
autocratising during 2000 to 2010, and 119 control countries that never 
autocratised from 1989 to 2019. The treatment countries comprised low and middle 
income nations and represent all world regions except North America and western 
Europe. A weighted combination of control countries was used to construct 
synthetic controls for each treatment country. This statistical method is 
especially well suited to population level studies when random assignment is 
infeasible and sufficiently similar comparators are not available. The method 
was originally developed in economics and political science to assess the impact 
of policies and events, and it is now increasingly used in epidemiology.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV-free life expectancy at age 5 years, UHC effective 
coverage index (0-100 point scale), and out-of-pocket spending on health per 
capita. All outcome variables are for the period 1989 to 2019.
RESULTS: Autocratising countries underperformed for all three outcome variables 
in the 10 years after the onset of autocratisation, despite some improvements in 
life expectancy, UHC effective coverage index, and out-of-pocket spending on 
health. On average, HIV-free life expectancy at age 5 years increased by 2.2% 
(from 64.7 to 66.1 years) during the 10 years after the onset of 
autocratisation. This study estimated that it would have increased by 3.5% (95% 
confidence interval 3.3% to 3.6%, P<0.001) (from 64.7 to 66.9 years) in the 
absence of autocratisation. On average, the UHC effective coverage index 
increased by 11.9% (from 42.5 to 47.6 points) during the 10 years after the 
onset of autocratisation. This study estimated that it would have increased by 
20.2% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 21.2%, P<0.001) (from 42.5 to 51.1 
points) in the absence of autocratisation. Finally, on average, out-of-pocket 
spending on health per capita increased by 10.0% (from $4.00 (£3.1; €3.4) to 
$4.4, log transformed) during the 10 years after the onset of autocratisation. 
This study estimated that it would have increased by only 4.4% (95% confidence 
interval 3.9% to 4.6%, P<0.001) (from $4.0 to $4.2, log transformed) in the 
absence of autocratisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Autocratising countries had worse than estimated life expectancy, 
effective health service coverage, and levels of out-of-pocket spending on 
health. These results suggest that the noticeable increase in the number of 
countries that are experiencing democratic erosion in recent years is hindering 
population health gains and progress toward UHC. Global health institutions will 
need to adjust their policy recommendations and activities to obtain the best 
possible results in those countries with a diminishing democratic incentive to 
provide quality healthcare to populations.

embryogenesis.

Angiogenesis is essential for the normal development of an embryo. Silver 
nanocolloid (SNC) is known to induce vascular malformation in the medaka embryo. 
We focused on the development of the central arteries (CtAs) in the hindbrain of 
Japanese medaka. The CtAs and the basilar artery from which they branch are 
essential for transporting the blood and nutrients necessary to support the 
hindbrain parenchyma and the development of the pons and cerebellum from the 
hindbrain. We exposed medaka embryos at developmental stage 21 (6 somite stage), 
to 0, 0.5, 5, or 10 mg/L SNC and evaluated hatching rate, number of thrombi per 
embryo, head size (length and width), body length, and angiogenesis. Although 
all SNC-exposed embryos hatched, their head size and body length were small in 
comparison to controls; in addition, the number of thrombi in the head increased 
and head size and body length decreased as the SNC concentration increased. To 
evaluate vasculogenic abnormalities, we performed whole-mount in situ 
hybridization using a vascular marker (eg, fl7) and visualized the CtAs in 
medaka embryos. In control embryos, CtAs started to sprout at stage 32 (somite 
completion stage) and their extension was complete by stage 35 (pectoral fin 
blood circulation stage). In contrast, CtAs failed to sprout in SNC-exposed 
embryos, and thrombi were present. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that SNC 
significantly suppressed the egfl7 expression level at stage 35. Together, our 
findings suggest that SNC induced decreased developments of head and body in 
medaka embryos due to insufficient angiogenesis and hindbrain vascular 
formation.

This work aims to prepare multifunctional edible coating based on alginate and 
Aloe vera (AV) optimized to minimum water vapor permeability (WVP) using 
Box-Behnken design. Titanium oxide nanoparticles (nTiO2) were incorporated into 
the optimized film at different contents. FTIR confirmed the structures, while 
XRD confirmed nTiO2 incorporation with a size ranging from 20.38 to 28.81 nm. 
The UV-shielding was enhanced either in the presence of AV or nTiO2. Thermal 
stability by TGA was improved upon increasing the nTiO2 content. WVP was 
significantly decreased from 21.53 g mm/m2 day kPa for calcium alginate to 
7.18 g mm/m2 day kPa in the presence of AV and nTiO2 (5 wt%). Color measurements 
showed non-significant changes in the film's transparency after AV and nTiO2 
incorporation. Mechanical and antimicrobial properties were improved in the 
presence of nTiO2. Shelf-life studies on tomatoes showed significant resistance 
to mass loss and spoilage when coated with (alginate/AV) film containing 5 wt% 
of nTiO2.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cost utility of treating non-frail 
versus frail or severely frail adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients. 79 
surgical ASD patients >18 years with available frailty and ODI data at baseline 
and 2-years post-surgery (2Y) were included. Utility data was calculated using 
the ODI converted to the SF-6D. QALYs utilized a 3% discount rate to account for 
decline to life expectancy (LE). Costs were calculated using the PearlDiver 
database. ICER was compared between non-operative (non-op.) and operative (op.) 
NF and F/SF patients at 2Y and LE. When compared to non-operative ASD, the ICER 
was $447,943.96 vs. $313,211.01 for NF and F/SF at 2Y, and $68,311.35 vs. 
$47,764.61 for NF and F/SF at LE. Frail and severely frail patients had lower 
cost per QALY compared to not frail patients at 2Y and life expectancy, and had 
lower ICER values when compared to a non-operative cohort of ASD patients. While 
these results support operative correction of frail and severely frail patients, 
it is important to note that these patients are often at worse baseline 
disability, which is closely related to frailty scores, and have more 
opportunity to improve postoperatively. Furthermore, there may be a threshold of 
frailty that is not operable due to the risk of severe complications that is not 
captured by this analysis. While future research should investigate economic 
outcomes at extended follow up times, these findings support the cost 
effectiveness of ASD surgery at all frailty states.

Cancer screening decisions in older adults can be complex due to the unclear 
cancer-specific mortality benefits of screening and several known harms 
including false positives, overdiagnosis, and procedural complications from 
downstream diagnostic interventions. In this review, we provide a framework for 
individualized cancer screening decisions among older adults, involving 
accounting for overall health and life expectancy, individual values, and the 
risks and benefits of specific cancer screening tests. We then discuss 
strategies for effective communication of recommendations during clinical visits 
that are considered more effective, easy to understand, and acceptable by older 
adults and clinicians.

Prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia is increasing in 
accordance with the increase of life expectancy and the resulting world 
population aging, while an effective pharmaceutical treatment is pending. These 
facts underline the need for development of targeted interventions that could 
decrease the incidence of dementia. Dietary supplementation, especially sources 
of ω-3 fatty acids and polyphenols such as fish oil and blueberries 
respectively, have been reported to have a beneficial effect on cognitive 
functioning. The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent findings of 
clinical studies investigating the effect of dietary supplementation on 
cognitive performance and identify potential effective interventions. For this 
purpose, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar research was conducted and a total of 
ten studies met the selection criteria. Four of these studies investigated the 
effect of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation. Two of these presented significant 
benefits in certain domains of cognitive functions (such as working memory, 
space imagery efficiency perceptual speed), in full scale IQ as well as 
prevention of hippocampal atrophy while the remaining two did not report any 
improvements. Two more studies investigated the effect of polyphenol 
supplementation and reported minor benefits in spatial memory as well as 
enhanced stimulation of certain brain regions. One study compared the effect of 
fish oil and blueberry supplementation as well as their combination and 
presented cognitive benefits for both fish oil and blueberries but not for their 
simultaneous administration. Finally, three more studies investigated the effect 
of DW 2009 soybean, ashwagandha and a nutraceutical formulation and reported 
cognitive benefits in attention, memory and global cognition respectively for 
their intervention groups. In total, eight studies investigated interventions on 
people with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Subjective Cognitive Impairment and all 
of them reported significant cognitive benefits in some cognitive domains. On 
the contrary, the remaining two studies included individuals with diagnosed 
dementia reported minimal to hardly any benefits. Conclusively, the 
interventions of the studies reviewed seem promising for individuals at risk of 
dementia, but not for those who are already diagnosed with dementia. However, 
further research is required to validate their effect as well as determine 
recommended doses.

BACKGROUND: Given increasing incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia, 
further understanding of modifiable factors contributing to increased healthspan 
is crucial. Extensive literature provides evidence that physical activity (PA) 
delays the onset of cognitive impairment; however, it is unclear whether 
engaging in PA in older adulthood is sufficient to influence progression through 
cognitive status categories.
METHOD: Applying a coordinated analysis approach, this project independently 
analyzed 14 longitudinal studies (NTotal = 52 039; mean baseline age across 
studies = 69.9-81.73) from North America and Europe using multistate survival 
models to estimate the impact of engaging in PA on cognitive status transitions 
(nonimpaired, mildly impaired, severely impaired) and death. Multinomial 
regression models were fit to estimate life expectancy (LE) based on American PA 
recommendations. Meta-analyses provided the pooled effect sizes for the role of 
PA on each transition and estimated LEs.
RESULTS: Controlling for baseline age, sex, education, and chronic conditions, 
analyses revealed that more PA is significantly associated with decreased risk 
of transitioning from nonimpaired to mildly impaired cognitive functioning and 
death, as well as substantially longer LE. Results also provided evidence for a 
protective effect of PA after onset of cognitive impairment (eg, decreased risk 
of transitioning from mild-to-severe cognitive impairment; increased likelihood 
of transitioning backward from severe-to-mild cognitive impairment), though 
between-study heterogeneity suggests a less robust association.
CONCLUSIONS: These results yield evidence for the importance of engaging in PA 
in older adulthood for cognitive health, and a rationale for motivating older 
adults to engage consistently in PA.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical efficacy of high-intensity focused 
ultrasound (HIFU) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
in the treatment of primary liver cancer (PLC) and its effect on the prognosis 
of patients.
METHODS: A total of 132 patients with PLC admitted to our hospital were selected 
for the study, among whom 68 patients received TACE combined with HIUF and were 
assigned to the observation group (OG), whereas the remaining 54 patients were 
treated with TACE alone and were assigned to the control group (CG). The factors 
influencing the patients' prognosis were also evaluated by multivariate 
analysis.
RESULTS: The total effective rate of the OG was 83.82%, which was significantly 
higher than that of 55.56% of the CG (P < .05). No significant difference was 
found in incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P > .05). After 
treatment, the increases of CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+, and NK cells in the OG were 
more significant than those in the CG (P < .05). However, the decrease of 
CD8+ cells was more significant in the OG than that in the CG (P < .05). The 
3-year survival rate of patients in the OG was 61.76%, which was significantly 
higher than that of 40.74% in the CG (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The application of TACE combined with HIFU is effective in treating 
PLC, which can prolong the life expectancy and improve the prognosis of patients 
with PLC without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions.

Health Center, Mianyang, China.

The aim of this study was to estimate whether kinematic alignment (KA) improves 
knee function or clinical outcomes compared with mechanical alignment (MA) in 
the short term after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We searched the literature 
for randomized controlled trials published before January 2020 from PubMed, 
EMBASE, Google, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and other databases. The 
observation markers included "The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
(WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index," "Knee Society Score (KSS)," "Oxford Knee Score 
(OKS)," "combined Knee Society Score (KSS)," "Knee injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS)," "European Quality of Life Measure-5 Domain-5-Level 
(EQ-5D-5L)," range of motion (ROM), lower limb alignment, ligament release, and 
complications. A total of 11 randomized controlled trial studies were included 
in the study. During the follow-up of 6-24 months, the KA-TKA group was superior 
to the MA-TKA group in terms of WOMAC scores, combined KSS, KSS, knee function 
scores, and knee range of flexion, but there was no significant difference in 
EQ-5D-5L, KOOS, KOOS (symptoms, pain, ADL, sports, and quality of life), 
complications, knee range of extension, hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, tibial 
component slope angle, lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA) or medial proximal 
tibial angle (MPTA) angle between the MA-TKA group and the MA-TKA group (P > 
0.05). Our meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of ligament release in the 
MA-TKA group was higher than that in the KA-TKA group. This meta-analysis shows 
that the KA-TKA group had better clinical outcomes and knee range of flexion 
than the MA-TKA group at short-term follow-up.

PURPOSE: The optimal schedule for palliative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 
in patients with bladder tumors with hematuria unfit for surgery remains 
undefined. This study aimed to assess the clinical hemostatic efficacy and 
safety of two EBRT hypofractionated schedules.
METHODS: From February 2008 to October 2017, 31 patients were referred to our 
department for palliative hemostatic bladder irradiation. EBRT consisted of two 
schedules: "continuous" treatment (CRT) was delivered following consecutive 3-10 
weekdays (3-6Gy/fraction (fr), to a total dose of 18-30Gy) (n=14); the 
"discontinuous" schedule (DRT) consisted of 23Gy in 4fr (6.5Gy/fr on days 1 and 
3, followed by 5Gy/fr on days 15 and 17; n=12). The primary endpoint was the 
rate of hemostatic control (HC) at the end of the radiation course. Other 
endpoints included mid-term HC, toxicities and overall survival. Comparative 
analyses were performed by exact Fisher test with a cut-off of 0.05 for 
statistical significance.
RESULTS: The rate of HC at the end of EBRT was 92% (n=24) with no differences 
between CRT and DRT (100% vs 86%; p=0.48). The median follow-up was 6 months, HC 
was achieved in 15/26 (58%) patients at the last follow-up, without meaningful 
differences between CRT and DRT (50% vs 67%; p=0.45). Three and two patients 
developed acute grade ≤2 diarrhea in CRT and DRT groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both hypofractionated "continuous" and 
"discontinuous" EBRT are well tolerated and represent acceptable schedules for 
patients with limited life expectancy. DRT schedule could be preferred for 
departments' organization to increase the slots for the treatment of other 
referred patients for radiotherapy.

review.

More than 150 cases of Fanconi syndrome (FS) or hypophosphatemia osteomalacia 
induced by low-dose adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) have been reported since 2002, when 
ADV was introduced for the long-term treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection. Because the life expectancy of HBV-infected individuals has 
increased, the adverse effects of long-term treatment with antiviral therapies 
are increasingly observed, and nephrotoxicity is one of the most severe adverse 
effects of ADV. Therefore, the number of cases may be far higher than reported. 
Moreover, ADV-induced FS is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed long after it first 
develops. ADV-induced FS may seriously decrease patient quality of life and lead 
to bone fractures and even disability. Although progress has been made in the 
identification of biomarkers and treatments, few systematic clinical guidelines 
or clinical reviews for FS induced by ADV have been reported. In this study, we 
highlighted the recent progress toward understanding of FS induced by ADV, 
described a clinical case, and summarized the primary characteristics and 
laboratory findings of this disease.

INTRODUCTION: Costa Rica, similar to many other Latin American countries is 
undergoing population aging at a fast pace. As a result of the epidemiological 
transition, the prevalence of diabetes has increased. This condition impacts not 
only individual lives, but also the healthcare system. The goal of this study is 
to examine the expected impact of diabetes, in terms of economic costs on the 
healthcare system and lives lost. We will also project how long it will take for 
the number of elderly individuals who are diabetic to double in Costa Rica.
METHODS: CRELES (Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study), a three-wave 
nationally representative longitudinal study, is the main source of data for 
this research (n = 2827). The projected impact of diabetes was estimated in 
three ways: length of time for the number of elderly individuals with diabetes 
to double; projected economic costs of diabetes-related hospitalizations and 
outpatient care; and years of life lost to diabetes at age 60. Data analyses and 
estimations used multiple regression models, longitudinal regression models, and 
Lee-Carter stochastic population projections.
RESULTS: Doubling time of the diabetic elderly population is projected to occur 
in 13 calendar years. This will cause increases in hospitalization and 
outpatient consultation costs. The impact of diabetes on life expectancy at age 
60 around the year 2035 is estimated to lead to a loss of about 7 months of 
life. The rapid pace at which the absolute number of elderly people with 
diabetes will double is projected to result in a negative economic impact on the 
healthcare system. Lives will also be lost due to diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Population aging will inevitably lead to an increasing number of 
elderly individuals, who are at greater risk for diabetes due to their lifelong 
exposure to risk factors. Actions to increase the quality of life of diabetic 
elderly are warranted. Decreasing the burden of diabetes on elderly populations 
and the Costa Rican healthcare system are necessary to impact the quantity and 
quality of life of incoming cohorts. Health promotion and prevention strategies 
that reduce diabetes risk factors are needed to improve the health of elderly 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorders, are more frequently affected by metabolic syndrome and 
cardiovascular (CV) diseases than the general population, with a significant 
reduction in life expectancy. Beyond metabolic syndrome, quantifying the risk of 
CV morbidity in the long-term may help clinicians to put in place preventive 
strategies. In this study, we assessed 10-year CV risk in patients with SMI and 
healthy individuals using an algorithm validated on the Italian general 
population.
METHODS: Patients aged 35-69 years diagnosed with SMI were consecutively 
recruited from psychiatric acute care units. Single CV risk factors were 
assessed, and 10-year CV risk calculated by means of the CUORE Project 10-year 
CV risk algorithm, based on the combination of the following risk factors: age, 
systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
diabetes, smoking habit, and hypertensive treatment. Patients' data were 
compared with those from the general population. The 10-year CV risk was 
log-transformed, and multivariable linear regression was used to estimate mean 
ratios, adjusting for age, and education.
RESULTS: Three hundred patients and 3,052 controls were included in the 
analysis. Among men, the 10-year CV risk score was very similar between patients 
with SMI and the general population (mean ratio [MR]: 1.02; 95%CI 0.77-1.37), 
whereas a 39% increase in 10-year CV risk was observed in women with SMI 
compared to the general population (MR: 1.39; 95%CI 1.16-1.66).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, women with SMI were consistently more at risk than 
the general population counterpart, even at younger age.

College of Medicine, Cheonan, Korea.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The incidence of stercoral perforation of the colon (SPC) is 
expected to rise, given the increased life expectancy and the aging population. 
On the other hand, the prognostic factors of mortality after surgery for SPC 
remain unclear. This study examined the prognostic factors of patients with SPC 
after surgery.
METHODS: The medical records of 145 patients who underwent surgery for colonic 
perforation between April 2010 and May 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. In 
145 patients, 22 patients who underwent SPC surgery were categorized into the 
following two groups according to in-hospital survival after surgery: alive 
(group A, n=15) and dead (group B, n=7).
RESULTS: In all enrolled patients, the mean age was 75.7±9.0 years, with a 
female predominance (female patients, n=19, 86.4%). Sixteen patients (72.7%) had 
chronic constipation with medications, and five patients (22.7%) were bedridden. 
The rate of preoperative bedridden status was significantly higher in group B 
than group A (6.7% vs. 57.1%; p=0.021). Univariate analysis revealed immobility, 
a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and lactate levels of more 
than 2.0 mmol/L to be factors associated with increased mortality rates in the 
postoperative period. Multivariate analysis revealed abnormal lactate levels to 
be the only factor related to mortality (hazard ratio 16.50, 95% CI 1.48-183.07, 
p=0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative abnormal serum lactate levels may be a risk factor for 
mortality after surgery in patients with stercoral perforation. Further research 
will be needed to identify the postoperative prognostic SPC factors.
