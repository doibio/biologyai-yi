severe concomitant diseases. The primary end-point was the local control rate, 
the secondary end-points including the overall survival rate, and adverse 
events. Results: Between December 2013 and March 2016, 22 patients were enrolled 
in this prospective study. All patients were re-irradiated with carbon-ion RT 
with radical intent. Five patients had rectal cancer, 4 had sarcoma, 4 had lung 
cancer, 3 had hepatic cell carcinoma, and 6 had other tumors. The median 
follow-up time was 26 months. Eight patients developed local recurrence, and the 
1- and 2-year local control rates were 71 and 60%, respectively. Eight patients 
died of their cancers and 2 died of other diseases. The 1- and 2-year overall 
survival rates were 76 and 67%, respectively. There were no grade 2 or higher 
acute adverse events and 4 patients (18%) developed grade 3 late adverse events. 
The group with the longer interval (>16 months) between the first RT and 
re-irradiation had significantly better outcomes than the shorter interval group 
(≤ 16 months). Conclusions: Re-irradiation, using carbon-ion RT with radical 
intent, had favorable local control and overall survival rates without severe 
toxicities for selected patients. Re-irradiation has the potential to improve 
clinical outcomes for isolated, local, recurrent tumors; further investigations 
are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy.

Non-traditional Oils Encapsulation as Novel Food Additive Enhanced Yogurt Safety 
Against Aflatoxins.

Noah Badr A, M El-Said M, M Elmessery T, Abdel-Razek AG.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hibiscus oil (HO) and black cumin oil (BCO) are 
interesting oils which give a source for photochemical. Yoghurt recognized for 
health benefits, but mycotoxin is a food problem. The aim was adjusting 
non-traditional capsulated oils for minimizing mycotoxins in dairy products 
(yoghurt) and biological systems.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oils fatty acid composition were evaluated. Micro and 
nano-emulsion designed to achieve food safety and shelf-life extension. 
Encapsulated emulsions evaluated by in vitro and in vivo models for several 
aflatoxins reduction through yogurt fortification model, for in vivo model 
reduction estimated as enhancement of rat's blood biochemical parameters. 
Concerning the in vitro model, changes of supplemented yoghurt properties were 
estimated.
RESULTS: Linoleic followed by oleic acid showed a high content in these oils 
representing omega fatty acids. Gamma fractions presented in considerable values 
(>50% of vitamin E). To evaluate encapsulated oils reduction on aflatoxins 
(AFs), it was estimated for in vitro and in vivo models. The in vitro reduction 
of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) recorded 31.6 and 34.9%, 
respectively in plain yogurt. However, yogurt fortification by oil-capsules 
upgraded the ratio for AFB1 (63.9%) and AFM1 (66.4%). The best reduction 
recorded using BCO fortification. For in vivo study, supplementation of rat's 
diet by BCO micro-capsule declared an enhancement of biochemical parameters 
against aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) effects. Fortified yogurt offered enhancement of 
viscosity and water holding capacity properties.
CONCLUSION: Encapsulated emulsions recorded high AFs reduction in fortified 
yogurt and experimental rat's model. Yogurt fortification enhanced its quality 
characteristics and shelf-life that give a recommendation for the application.

Diagnosis of sacroiliac dysfunction in horses includes manual motion palpation 
of the equine ilium and sacrum. Motion of the ilium and sacrum during manual 
force application to the equine pelvis has been measured previously in vitro. 
The aim of this study was to measure the amount and direction of motion in vivo, 
including comparison of bone-fixated and skin-mounted inertial sensors. Sensors 
were skin-mounted over tuber sacrale (TS) and third sacral spinous process of 
six Thoroughbred horses and later attached via Steinmann pins inserted into the 
same bony landmarks. Orientations of each TS and sacrum were recorded by one 
investigator during six trials of manual force applied to the pelvis, inducing 
cranial, caudal, and oblique rotations. Mean values were reported in Euler 
angles for the three orthogonal planes lateral bending, flexion-extension (FE), 
and axial rotation (AR). Differences between skin- and bone-fixated markers were 
determined with significance set at P < .05. The largest mean values recorded 
during rotations applied to the pelvises were for FE, (2.08° ± 0.35°) with 
bone-fixated sensors. AR gave the largest values recorded with skin mountings 
(1.70° ± 0.48°). There was a poor correlation between skin-mounted and 
bone-fixated markers with AR being the orthogonal plane in which results from 
skin mounting were closest to results from bone-fixated sensors Bony kinematics 
during external movement applied to the pelvis cannot be predicted from 
skin-mounted sensors, due to differences between skin- and bone-mounted sensors.

Does the rapid response of an antidepressant contribute to better 
cost-effectiveness? Comparison between mirtazapine and SSRIs for first-line 
treatment of depression in Japan.

AIM: Previous studies indicate that mirtazapine is unique in its quick 
responsiveness compared to other antidepressants. Although some other studies 
have evaluated its cost-effectiveness, they have not considered its early stage 
remission rate. The aim of this study was to address this research gap by using 
precise clinical data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirtazapine in 
Japan.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to reflect the week-by-week transition 
probabilities. The Markov cycle was set as 1 week. While our clinical parameters 
were obtained largely from existing meta-analyses, cost data were derived from 
government reports. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year estimated based 
on the probability sensitivity analyses. The ICERs were estimated at 2, 8, 26, 
and 52 weeks.
RESULTS: In severe depression, the ICERs ranged between JPY 872 153 and 
1 772 723. The probability of mirtazapine being cost-effective ranged from 0.75 
to 0.99 when the ICER threshold was JPY 5 000 000. In moderate depression, the 
ICERs ranged between JPY 2 356 499 and 4 770 145. The probability of mirtazapine 
being cost-effective ranged from 0.55 to 0.83 when the ICER threshold was JPY 
5 000 000.
CONCLUSION: When considering the early stage efficacy of mirtazapine, it 
appeared to be cost-effective compared to selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, especially for severe depression and in the early stage treatment in 
the Japanese setting. However, our study has some limitations. First, 
mirtazapine is compared with batched selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
rather than individual ones. Second, we did not consider antidepressant 
combination therapy as treatment options.

OBJECTIVE: Generators implanted for deep brain stimulation must be replaced 
after several years. If a Kinetra generator is replaced by the Activa-PC, an 
adaptor will be required to attach it to the original extension cables. On the 
basis of our clinical impression that the battery life of the Active-PC 
generator was shorter when an adaptor was used, we performed this retrospective 
study.
METHODS: We determined the battery lifetimes of deep brain stimulation 
generators that had been implanted in our department. The inclusion criterion 
was the initial implantation of a Kinetra generator that was later replaced by 
an Activa-PC with adaptor, which itself was subsequently also replaced. These 
patients were compared with an Activa-PC control group without an adaptor but 
identical with regard to number of battery exchanges, disease, and target.
RESULTS: There were 28 patients in the study group and 14 in the control group. 
Battery lifetime of the Activa-PC with adaptor (32.4 ± 7.7 months) was 
significantly shorter than that of the Kinetra (53.5 ± 15.7 months, 
P = 0.000006). The battery life of Activa-PC without an adaptor (35.3 ± 8.2 
months) did not differ significantly from that of the Activa-PC with an adaptor 
(P = 0.333).
CONCLUSIONS: The battery lifetime in a replacement Activa-PC is shorter than 
that in the original Kinetra generator. Adaptors have no significant effect on 
battery life. Patients should be informed that the battery in their new 
generator must be checked more frequently than before.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the public health benefits and economic value of 
live-attenuated yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine in Colombia.
METHODS: A decision tree model was used to assess the theoretical impact of 
routine YF vaccination of 1-year-olds (no "catch-up") during the interepidemic 
period from 1980 to 2002, avoiding capturing the impact of YF vaccine 
introduction in 2003. The vaccine was assumed to be 99% effective, to provide 
lifetime protection, and to cover 85% of the target population. Costs per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted were computed from payer and 
societal perspectives. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: During the interepidemic period, routine YF vaccination would have 
averted 2223 nonfatal cases of YF and 65 deaths, leading to an overall reduction 
of 1365 DALYs. The net cost of this vaccination would have been $25 964 813 
(payer's perspective) and $16 535 465 (societal perspective). Cost per DALY 
averted was $19 022 and $12 114 from payer and societal perspectives, 
respectively (all costs in 2015 US dollars). Vaccination was considered 
cost-effective from both perspectives (ie, between 1- and 3-fold the gross 
domestic product per capita, $7158) and remains so if price per dose was $2.75 
or less and $4.66 from payer and societal perspectives, respectively. 
Underreporting had the largest impact on the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine toddler YF vaccination in Colombia would have been 
considered cost-effective in the prevaccination era. This study provides 
insights on the value of vaccination in an upper middle-income country.

BACKGROUND: Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a rare autosomal recessive 
disorder characterized by early-onset nephrotic syndrome and microcephaly with 
brain anomalies. WDR73 pathogenic variants were described as the first genetic 
cause of GAMOS and, very recently, four novel causative genes, OSGEP, LAGE3, 
TP53RK, and TPRKB, have been identified.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the clinical and genetic characteristics of two 
unrelated infants with clinical suspicion of GAMOS who were born from 
consanguineous parents. Both patients showed a similar clinical presentation, 
with early-onset nephrotic syndrome, microcephaly, brain atrophy, developmental 
delay, axial hypotonia, and early fatality. We identified two novel likely 
disease-causing variants in the OSGEP gene. These two cases, in conjunction with 
the findings of a literature review, indicate that OSGEP pathogenic variants are 
associated with an earlier onset of nephrotic syndrome and shorter life 
expectancy than WDR73 pathogenic variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the spectrum of pathogenic variants in the 
OSGEP gene and, taken in conjunction with the results of the literature review, 
suggest that the OSGEP gene should be considered the main known monogenic cause 
of GAMOS. Early genetic diagnosis of GAMOS is of paramount importance for 
genetic counseling and family planning.

BACKGROUND: Social risk factors are important dimensions of health and are 
linked to access to care, quality of life, health outcomes and life expectancy. 
However, in the Electronic Health Record, data related to many social risk 
factors are primarily recorded in free-text clinical notes, rather than as more 
readily computable structured data, and hence cannot currently be easily 
incorporated into automated assessments of health. In this paper, we present 
Moonstone, a new, highly configurable rule-based clinical natural language 
processing system designed to automatically extract information that requires 
inferencing from clinical notes. Our initial use case for the tool is focused on 
the automatic extraction of social risk factor information - in this case, 
housing situation, living alone, and social support - from clinical notes. 
Nursing notes, social work notes, emergency room physician notes, primary care 
notes, hospital admission notes, and discharge summaries, all derived from the 
Veterans Health Administration, were used for algorithm development and 
evaluation.
RESULTS: An evaluation of Moonstone demonstrated that the system is highly 
accurate in extracting and classifying the three variables of interest (housing 
situation, living alone, and social support). The system achieved positive 
predictive value (i.e. precision) scores ranging from 0.66 (homeless/marginally 
housed) to 0.98 (lives at home/not homeless), accuracy scores ranging from 0.63 
(lives in facility) to 0.95 (lives alone), and sensitivity (i.e. recall) scores 
ranging from 0.75 (lives in facility) to 0.97 (lives alone).
CONCLUSIONS: The Moonstone system is - to the best of our knowledge - the first 
freely available, open source natural language processing system designed to 
extract social risk factors from clinical text with good (lives in facility) to 
excellent (lives alone) performance. Although developed with the social risk 
factor identification task in mind, Moonstone provides a powerful tool to 
address a range of clinical natural language processing tasks, especially those 
tasks that require nuanced linguistic processing in conjunction with inference 
capabilities.

OBJECTIVE: The APHINITY trial assessed the effectiveness and the safety of 
adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy (THP) compared to trastuzumab 
and chemotherapy (TH) in the adjuvant management of human epidermal growth 
factor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. We performed a study to project the 
potential cost-effectiveness of THP vs. TH.
STUDY DESIGN: Trial-based cost-utility modeling analysis.
METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation from a payer perspective using a 
Markov model with six health states: invasive disease-free survival, 
non-metastatic recurrence, remission, first-line metastatic, subsequent line 
metastatic, and death. We parameterized the model using data from both arms in 
APHINITY extrapolated to a patient's lifetime horizon. Estimates of health state 
utilities were based on EQ-5D trial data and the literature, and costs were 
estimated from government sources and the published literature. The primary 
outcomes of the model were life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty was 
addressed via univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For the intention-to-treat population, the model projected improved 
outcomes (by 0.50 LYs and 0.45 QALYs) and increased costs (by $74 420) for ICERs 
of $147 774/LY gained and $167 185/QALY gained for PHT vs. HT patients. In the 
node-positive patient population, the model projected improved outcomes (by 0.86 
LYs and 0.76 QALYs) and increased costs (by $66 647) for ICERs of $77 684/LY 
gained and $87 929/QALY gained. For the hormone-receptor-negative patient 
population, the model projected health gains, increased costs, and ICERs of $147 
022/LY gained and $166 518/QALY gained. The results were sensitive to changes in 
the model time horizon.
CONCLUSION: The addition of pertuzumab to the available regimens for HER2+ early 
breast cancer is likely to be cost-effective for patients in the U.S. at high 
risk of recurrence.

Eliciting Health State Utilities Using Paired-Gamble Methods: The Role of the 
Starting Point.

BACKGROUND: Paired-gamble methods have been proposed to avoid the "certainty 
effect" associated with standard gamble methods.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines the role of starting-point effects in 
paired-gamble methods. In particular, it examines how the utilities so derived 
vary as a function of the probabilities of the stimulus lottery.
METHODS: A sample of 455 members of the Spanish general population valued 9 
health states via face-to-face interviews. Subjects were randomly placed into 3 
subgroups, which differed in terms of the stimulus gamble's probability. 
Nonparametric tests and an interval regression model were used to test if 
utilities change when the probability distribution is modified.
RESULTS: Nonparametric tests showed that the probability of a health state being 
considered worse than death did not differ among subgroups. Nevertheless, 
changes in the stimulus gamble did produce significant differences in the 
distribution of utilities: the higher the probability of full health in the 
stimulus, the higher the utility elicited. Regression estimates support the 
existence of starting-point effects when the utilities are obtained under 
expected utility. According to the prospect theory, the conclusions depend on 
the reference point considered. When the reference points used are death or the 
health state evaluated, we observe differences among these groups. Nevertheless, 
when full health is used, these differences disappear.
CONCLUSION: This research suggests that paired-gamble methods may also be 
susceptible to starting-point effects. Yet the differences are small, and they 
disappear when the data are analyzed using prospect theory with full health as 
the reference point.

OBJECTIVES: Healthcare expenditures in the United States continue to grow; to 
control costs, there has been a shift away from volume-focused care to 
value-based care. The incorporation of patient perspectives in the development 
of value-based healthcare is critical, yet research addressing this issue is 
limited. This study explores awareness and understanding of patients with cancer 
about the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), as well as their perspectives 
regarding the use of the QALY to measure value in healthcare.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used survey methodology to explore patient 
awareness, understanding, and perspectives on the QALY. A total of 774 patients 
with cancer and survivors completed this survey in June and July of 2017. 
Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Results showed that there is limited awareness of the QALY among 
patients with cancer and survivors and minimal understanding of how the QALY is 
used. Only one quarter of respondents believed that the QALY was a good way to 
measure value in healthcare. Some participants (5%) stated that the QALY could 
be personally helpful to them in their own decision making, indicating the 
possible usefulness of the QALY as a decision aid in cancer care. Nevertheless, 
participants expressed concern about other decision makers using the QALY to 
allocate cancer care and resources and maintained a strong desire for autonomy 
over personal healthcare choices.
CONCLUSIONS: Although participants believed that the QALY could help them make 
more informed decisions, there was concern about how it would be used by payers, 
policymakers, and other decision makers in determining access to care. 
Implications for policy and research are discussed.

Russia and Ukraine.

Moldova.

Most studies dedicated to alcohol-related mortality in the former USSR countries 
explore the situation primarily in Russia and Belarus, while somewhat less so in 
Ukraine. In these countries, the consumption of spirits is one of the main 
contributors to a huge decline in adult health since the mid-60s, especially 
among males. Moldova, also an ex-Soviet country, is quite different in that 
their drinking habits are much closer to those of the Mediterranean drinking 
culture, although they are still like Russia and Ukraine in that their level of 
alcohol consumption is among the highest in the world while life expectancy at 
birth is one of the lowest among developed countries. This study provides a 
descriptive analysis of the changes in alcohol-related mortality trends and 
drinking patterns in Moldova as compared to Ukraine and Russia, both during the 
Soviet period and after Independence. We found that accidental poisoning by 
alcohol in Moldova is of minor importance in contrast to Russia and Ukraine, 
whereas very high liver cirrhosis mortality without a traditional sex gap is a 
peculiar feature of the Moldovan mortality pattern. Furthermore, the burden of 
liver cirrhosis accounts for much lower Moldovan female life expectancy compared 
to their Russian or Ukrainian counterparts. We attempt to explain this 
phenomenon by hypothesizing the existence of harmful drinking habits of homemade 
wine consumption in Moldova, which seems to affect males and females equally. In 
Moldova, the anti-alcohol policies must include the measures aimed at reducing 
the consumption of homemade wine.

While there has been considerable debate about extending the length of working 
life, relatively little is known about this issue. We use data from the Spanish 
Continuous Working Life Sample for 2004-2013 to calculate period working life 
tables, which in turn allows us to assess the impact of the financial crisis on 
working life expectancy in Spain. Before the recession hit, working life 
expectancy in Spain was around 38 years for males and 33 years for females. The 
recession had a tremendous impact on the Spanish labor market, but the effects 
differed considerably by gender and occupational category. Men working in 
skilled non-manual jobs were less affected, while men working in unskilled 
manual jobs lost close to 14 years of working life expectancy. Women were less 
affected than men. With working life expectancy decreasing, the average 
proportion of lifetime spent in unemployment and outside the labor market 
increased markedly, whereas the average number of years spent in retirement 
changed only a little. When we decompose losses in working life expectancy by 
age group, we find that economic fluctuations affect both older and younger 
workers. This result suggests that policies that focus on retirement ages only 
are incomplete. We also compare our findings to the results obtained by 
Sullivans method, which is based on prevalence rates rather than the 
incidence-based working life table approach. We find that the use of Sullivans 
approach does not accurately reflect the levels of and the trends in working 
life expectancy.

We offer a new approach for modeling past trends in the quantiles of the life 
table survivorship function. Trends in the quantiles are estimated, and the 
extent to which the observed patterns fit the unit root hypothesis or, 
alternatively, an innovative outlier model, are conducted. Then a factor model 
is applied to the detrended data, and it is used to construct quantile cycles. 
We enrich the ongoing discussion about human longevity extension by calculating 
specific improvements in the distribution of the survivorship function, across 
its full range, and not only at the central-age ranges. To illustrate our 
proposal, we use data for the UK from 1922 to 2013. We find that there is no 
sign in the data of any reduction in the pace of longevity extension during the 
last decades.

Do Japanese and Italian Women Live Longer than Women in Scandinavia?

Life expectancies at birth are routinely computed from period life tables. When 
mortality is falling, such period life expectancies will typically underestimate 
real life expectancies, that is, life expectancies for birth cohorts. Hence, it 
becomes problematic to compare period life expectancies between countries when 
they have different historical mortality developments. For instance, life 
expectancies for countries in which the longevity improved early (like Norway 
and Sweden) are difficult to compare with those in countries where it improved 
later (like Italy and Japan). To get a fair comparison between the countries, 
one should consider cohort data. Since cohort life expectancies can only be 
computed for cohorts that were born more than a hundred years ago, in this paper 
we suggest that for younger cohorts one may consider the expected number of 
years lost up to a given age. Contrary to the results based on period data, our 
cohort results then indicate that Italian women may expect to lose more years 
than women in Norway and Sweden, while there are no indications that Japanese 
women will lose fewer years than women in Scandinavia. The large differences 
seen for period data may just be an artefact due to the distortion that period 
life tables imply in times of changing mortality.

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cognitive impairment may occur. This 
could detrimentally influence communication between patient and health-care 
professionals and make clinical assessment difficult. Given the short life 
expectancy after diagnosis, it is crucial to accurately identify ALS patients 
early. Although suitable cognitive screening tools for patients with ALS are 
available, they have not been evaluated in a Norwegian population. 
Interpretation of scores for available tests and practical application of 
scoring is also not well established. The protocol described here involves two 
related studies that aim to improve the quality of ALS clinical testing 
instruments used in the Norwegian population. The first is a validation study 
that evaluates the psychometric properties of the ECAS-Norwegian. The second is 
a prospective cohort study that evaluates the ECAS-Norwegian as a tool to 
predict early changes in ability to work, drive a car and the need for advanced 
therapy. Study 1 is a multicenter study using international quality criteria. 
Patients with ALS, healthy control subjects, and control subjects with dementia 
will be included. Primary outcome is ECAS-Norwegian scores. In study 2, patients 
with ALS will be included. ECAS-Norwegian compared to Clinical Dementia Rating 
score and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores will be used as a prognostic tool 
for working, driving, and initiating advanced life-prolonging therapy. Before 
clinical implementation, the ECAS-Norwegian needs to be evaluated and validated. 
Successful validation and implementation of the ECAS-Norwegian may provide early 
identification of cognitive impairment in ALS, leading to more proactive, 
individualized treatment.

Bronchoscopy is the safest procedure for lung cancer diagnosis when an invasive 
evaluation is required after imaging procedures. However, its sensitivity is 
relatively low, especially for small and peripheral lesions. We assessed 
benefits and costs of introducing a bronchial gene-expression classifier (BGC) 
to improve the performance of bronchoscopy and the overall diagnostic process 
for early detection of lung cancer. We used discrete-event simulation to compare 
clinical and economic outcomes of two different strategies with the standard 
practice in former and current smokers with indeterminate nodules: (i) 
location-based strategy-integrated the BGC to the bronchoscopy indication; (ii) 
simplified strategy-extended use of bronchoscopy plus BGC also on small and 
peripheral lesions. Outcomes modeled were rate of invasive procedures, 
quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. Compared to the standard practice, the location-based strategy (i) 
reduced absolute rate of invasive procedures by 3.3% without increasing costs at 
the current BGC market price. It resulted in savings when the BGC price was less 
than $3,000. The simplified strategy (ii) reduced absolute rate of invasive 
procedures by 10% and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy, producing an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,109 per QALY. In patients with 
indeterminate nodules, both BGC strategies reduced unnecessary invasive 
procedures at high risk of adverse events. Moreover, compared to the standard 
practice, the simplified use of BGC for central and peripheral lesions resulted 
in larger QALYs gains at acceptable cost. The location-based is cost-saving if 
the price of classifier declines.

AIMS: Life expectancy in Marfan syndrome patients has improved thanks to the 
early detection of aortic dilation and prophylactic aortic root surgery. Current 
international clinical guidelines support the use of aortic root diameter as a 
predictor of complications. However, other imaging markers are needed to improve 
risk stratification. This study aim to ascertain whether proximal aorta 
longitudinal and circumferential strain and distensibility assessed by cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR) predict the aortic root dilation rate and aortic events 
in Marfan syndrome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen Marfan patients with no previous 
aortic dissection, cardiac/aortic surgery, or moderate/severe aortic 
regurgitation were prospectively included in a multicentre protocol of clinical 
and imaging follow-up. At baseline, CMR was performed and proximal aorta 
longitudinal strain and ascending aorta circumferential strain and 
distensibility were obtained. During follow-up (85.7 [75.0-93.2] months), the 
annual growth rate of aortic root diameter was 0.62 ± 0.65 mm/year. Fifteen 
patients underwent elective surgical aortic root replacement and four presented 
aortic dissection. Once corrected for baseline clinical and demographic 
characteristics and aortic root diameter, proximal aorta longitudinal strain, 
but not circumferential strain and distensibility, was an independent predictor 
of the aortic root diameter growth rate (P = 0.001, P = 0.823, and P = 0.997, 
respectively), z-score growth rate (P = 0.013, P = 0.672, and P = 0.680, 
respectively), and aortic events (P = 0.023, P = 0.096, and P = 0.237, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Proximal aorta longitudinal strain is independently related to the 
aortic root dilation rate and aortic events in addition to aortic root diameter, 
clinical risk factors, and demographic characteristics in Marfan syndrome 
patients.

IMPORTANCE: Although both short-course radiotherapy and long-course 
chemoradiotherapy have been practiced in parallel for more than 15 years, no 
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing these 2 approaches in patients with 
locally advanced rectal cancer has been published.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of short-course radiotherapy vs 
long-course chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally 
advanced rectal cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation used a 
cost-effectiveness model simulating 10-year outcomes for 1 million hypothetical 
patients aged 65 years with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with either 
short-course radiotherapy or long-course chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgery 
and chemotherapy. Utilities and probabilities from the literature and costs from 
the Healthcare Bluebook and Medicare fee schedules were used to determine 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. It was assumed that long-course 
chemoradiotherapy would result in higher rates of low anterior resection (LAR). 
To model preference-sensitive care, a 2-way sensitivity analysis was conducted 
in which the utilities of the no-evidence-of-disease (NED) states with LAR and 
abdominoperineal resection (APR) were simultaneously varied. The analysis was 
repeated for patients with distal rectal tumors. Analysis was conducted from 
January to October 2018.
EXPOSURES: Short-course radiotherapy and long-course chemoradiotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Short-course radiotherapy was the cost-effective strategy compared with 
long-course chemoradiotherapy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $133 495 
per quality-adjusted life-year). Two-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the 
cost-effective approach for a given patient depended on the utilities for the 
NED-LAR and NED-APR states. Assuming that a greater proportion of patients with 
locally advanced distal tumors undergoing long-course chemoradiotherapy (39%) 
would proceed to LAR compared with those treated with short-course radiotherapy 
(19%), long-course chemoradiotherapy was the cost-effective approach 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $61 123 per quality-adjusted life-year).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Short-course radiotherapy was the cost-effective 
strategy compared with long-course chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally 
advanced rectal cancer. The cost-effectiveness of short-course radiotherapy vs 
long-course chemoradiotherapy was sensitive to the utilities of the NED-LAR and 
NED-APR health states, highlighting the importance of care that is sensitive to 
patient preference. Long-course chemoradiotherapy was the cost-effective 
approach for patients with distal tumors.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the one of the most common inherited diseases. It 
affects around 10,000 people in the UK, and the median survival age is 47. 
Recent developments making use of longitudinal patient registry data are 
producing more detailed and relevant information about predicted life expectancy 
in CF based on current age and clinical measurements. The objective of this 
study was toconduct an online survey of adults with CF living in the UK using a 
web-based questionnaire to investigate: (i) if and how they access information 
on life expectancy; (ii) what they use it for; (iii) if they want more 
personalised information on life expectancy or the time until other milestones. 
The survey was advertised through the Cystic Fibrosis Trust using social media. 
There were 85 respondents, covering men (39%) and women (61%) aged 16-65. 75% 
had received information on life expectancy either from their CF care team (34%) 
or other sources (71%), the most common being the Cystic Fibrosis Trust website 
and research literature. Most people who received information found it to be 
beneficial and reported using it in a variety of ways, including to plan 
strategies for maintaining as best health as possible and to psychologically 
manage current health status. 82% of respondents were interested in more 
personalised information about their life expectancy, and participants also 
noted interest in other outcomes, including time to needing transplant or 
reaching a low level of lung function. Themes arising in text responses included 
the importance of good communication of information, the difficulty of relating 
general information to one's own circumstances, and a desire for increased 
information on factors that impact on survival in CF. As an outcome from this 
work, research is underway to establish how information on life expectancy can 
be presented to people with CF in an accessible way.
