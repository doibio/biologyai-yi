BACKGROUND: According to a small pilot study on palliative cancer patients at 
our ward, vitamin D supplementation had beneficial effects on pain (measured as 
opioid consumption), infections and quality of life (QoL) without having any 
significant side effects.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the 'Palliative-D' study is to test the 
hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation for 12 weeks reduces opioid 
consumption. The secondary objectives are to study if reduction of antibiotic 
consumption and fatigue as well as improvement in QoL assessments can be 
observed. Effect on the 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) levels in serum after 12 
weeks of treatment will be studied, as well as the change in opioid dose in 
relation to genetic polymorphism in genes involved in the effect and metabolism 
of vitamin D.
METHOD: A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial has been 
designed. The trial will include 254 adult palliative cancer patients with 
25-OHD levels <50 nmol/L and a life expectancy of more than 3 months recruited 
from two advanced palliative home care centres in Stockholm. Included patients 
will be randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with cholecalciferol (vitamin 
D3) 4000 IU/day or placebo. The study will start in November 2017 and will 
finish in December 2019. The study is approved by the Regional Ethical 
Committee, Dnr2017/405-31/1, by the Swedish Medical Products Agency, EudraCT: 
2017-000268-14, and is registered at Clinicaltrial.gov: NCT03038516. The study 
is financed with research grants from the Swedish Cancer Society and the 
Stockholm County Council.

The absence of an adequate reversal strategy to prevent and stop potential 
life-threatening bleeding complications is a major drawback to the clinical use 
of the direct oral inhibitors of blood coagulation factor Xa. Here we show that 
specific modifications of the substrate-binding aromatic S4 subpocket within the 
factor Xa active site disrupt high-affinity engagement of the direct factor Xa 
inhibitors. These modifications either entail amino-acid substitution of S4 
subsite residues Tyr99 and/or Phe174 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), or extension 
of the 99-loop that borders the S4 subsite. The latter modifications led to the 
engineering of a factor Xa variant that is able to support coagulation in human 
plasma spiked with (supra-)physiological concentrations of direct factor Xa 
inhibitors. As such, this factor Xa variant has the potential to be employed to 
bypass the direct factor Xa inhibitor-mediated anticoagulation in patients that 
require restoration of blood coagulation.A major drawback in the clinical use of 
the oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit factor Xa in order to prevent 
blood clot formation is the potential for life threatening bleeding events. Here 
the authors describe factor Xa variants that are refractory to inhibition by 
these anticoagulants and could serve as rescue agents in treated patients.

Caffeine is a widely consumed psychoactive substance, but little is known about 
the effects of caffeine stimulation on global gene expression changes in 
neurons. Here, we conducted gene expression profiling of human neuroepithelial 
stem cell-derived neurons, stimulated with normal consumption levels of caffeine 
(3 μM and 10 μM), over a period of 9 h. We found dosage-dependent activation of 
immediate early genes after 1 h. Neuronal projection development processes were 
up-regulated and negative regulation of axon extension processes were 
down-regulated at 3 h. In addition, genes involved in extracellular matrix 
organization, response for wound healing, and regulation of immune system 
processes were down-regulated by caffeine at 3 h. This study identified novel 
genes within the neuronal projection guidance pathways that respond to acute 
caffeine stimulation and suggests potential mechanisms for the effects of 
caffeine on neuronal cells.

PURPOSE: Complete fibula absence often presents with significant lower-limb 
deformity. Parental counselling regarding management is paramount in achieving 
the optimum functional outcome. Amputation offers a single surgical event with 
minimal complications. This study compares outcomes with an amputation protocol 
to those using an extension prosthesis.
METHOD: Thirty-two patients were identified. Nine patients (2 males, 7 females; 
median age at assessment of 23.5 years) used an extension prosthesis. 
Twenty-three patients (16  males, 7 females; median age at assessment of eight 
years) underwent 25 amputations during childhood. Mobility was assessed using 
SIGAM and K scores. Quality of life was assessed using the PedsQL inventory 
questionnaire; pain by a verbal severity score.
RESULTS: The 19 Syme and one Boyd amputation in 19 patients were performed early 
(mean age 15 months). Four Syme and one trans-tibial amputation in four patients 
took place in older children (mean age 6.6 years). Only two underwent tibial 
kyphus correction to aid prosthetic fitting. K scores were significantly higher 
(mean 4 vs 2) and pain scores lower in the amputation group allowing high impact 
activity compared with community ambulation with an extension prosthesis. The 
SIGAM and PedsQL scores were all better in the amputation group, but not 
significantly so.
CONCLUSION: Childhood amputation for severe limb length inequality and foot 
deformity in congenital fibula absence offers excellent short-term functional 
outcome with prosthetic support. The tibial kyphus does not need routine 
correction and facilitates prosthetic suspension. Accommodative extension 
prostheses offer reasonable long-term function but outcome scores are lower.

Fractures of the upper extremity of the femur are serious because of their 
morbidity and social and/or economic consequences. They have been the subject of 
several studies of world literature concerning their hospital treatment, 
evolution and prevention. The increase in the incidence of this pathology seems 
unavoidable due to population ageing and to the lengthening life expectancy; it 
is posing a real long-term public health problem whose importance will be 
further increased by the need to control health care costs. The results of this 
study show that the average age of onset of fracture of the proximal extremity 
of the femur is 68,13 ± 16.9 years, with a male predominance and a sex ratio of 
1.14. In our study pertrochanterian fractures represented 69.4% of cases. Direct 
medical costs of the hospital treatment of fractures of the upper extremity of 
the femur at the Hassan II University Hospital were £387 714,38 in 222 cases, 
with an average cost of £1757,4 , including costs for patient's stay in 
hospital, which represented the majority of expenses ( 77% of total costs). It 
is desirable to raise staff awareness of the costs of consumables in order to 
reduce treatment costs and to adopt cost-oriented behaviour. Length of stay 
should be limited to the maximum extent because it only allows to reduce staff 
and accommodation costs.

Les fractures de l'extrémité supérieure du fémur sont des fractures graves du 
fait de leur morbidité et de leurs conséquences sociales et/ou économiques. 
Elles font l'objet de plusieurs études à l'échelle mondiale concernant leurs 
prises en charge thérapeutique, leurs évolutions et leurs préventions. En raison 
du vieillissement de la population et de l'allongement de l'espérance de vie, 
l'augmentation de l'incidence de cette pathologie paraît inéluctable et posera à 
terme un véritable problème de santé publique dont l'importance sera encore 
majorée par la nécessité d'une maîtrise des dépenses de santé. Les résultats de 
ce travail montrent que l'âge moyen de survenue d'une fracture de l'extrémité 
proximale du fémur est de 68,13 ± 16,9 ans, et que la prédominance a été 
masculine avec un sex-ratio de 1,14. Les fractures per trochantériennes ont 
représenté 69,4% des cas. Le coût médical direct hospitalier des fractures de 
l'extrémité supérieure du fémur au CHU Hassan II est de 387 714,38 £ chez 222 
cas, avec un coût moyen de 1757,4 £, dont les frais liés au séjour ont 
représenté la majorité des dépenses avec 77% du coût total. Pour diminuer le 
coût de la prise en charge de cette pathologie, il est souhaitable de 
sensibiliser le personnel sur le coût des consommables à fin d'adapter le 
comportement le plus économique. Et aussi il faudrait limiter au maximum la 
durée de séjour car elle seule permet de réduire les dépenses liées au frais du 
personnel et l'hôtellerie.

IMPORTANCE: Long-term prognosis informs clinical and personal decisions for 
older adults with late-life disability. However, many clinicians worry that 
telling patients their prognosis may cause harm.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety of and reactions to prognosis communication in 
late-life disability.
DESIGN: Participants estimated their own life expectancy and were then presented 
their calculated life expectancy using a validated prognostic index. We used a 
semi-structured interview guide to ask for their reactions. Qualitative data 
were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Potential psychological and 
behavioral outcomes in response to receiving one's calculated prognosis were 
recorded and re-assessed 2-4 weeks later.
SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults age 70+ residing in the San Francisco 
Bay Area.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty five older adults with a median age of 80 requiring 
assistance with ≥1 Activity of Daily Living.
RESULTS: Self-estimates of life expectancy were similar to calculated results 
for 16 participants. 15 estimated their life expectancy to be longer than their 
calculated life expectancy by >2 years, while 4 shorter by >2 years. An 
overarching theme of, "fitting life expectancy into one's narrative" emerged 
from qualitative analysis. Discussing life expectancy led participants to 
express how they could alter their life expectancy (subtheme "locus of 
control"), how they saw their present health (subtheme "perceived health"), and 
their hopes and fears for the remaining years of their lives (subtheme "outlook 
on remaining years"). Feelings of anxiety and sadness in reaction to receiving 
calculated prognosis were rare.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: About half of the disabled older adults' 
self-estimates of prognosis were similar to calculated estimates. Evidence of 
sadness or anxiety was rare. These data suggest that in most cases, clinicians 
may offer to discuss prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: Cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in both the hereditary form 
of transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis and the sporadic late-age-onset transthyretin 
amyloidosis (ATTR wild-type (ATTRwt)). Clinically disease progression from time 
of diagnosis to death is usually quoted as 5- to 15-years. In prior studies, 
significant progression of cardiac parameters in patients with moderate to 
severe cardiomyopathy has been noted within a 12-month time span.
METHODS: The present study was designed to prospectively monitor changes in 
cardiac parameters, both structural and functional, in patients with ATTR 
cardiomyopathy while treated with a TTR specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO; 
IONIS-TTR℞) designed to lower blood levels of the amyloid fibril precursor 
protein. To date 22 patients have been admitted to the study, 15 have completed 
12 months on the drug and are the subject of this report.
RESULTS: Eight patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis and 7 patients with 
wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with moderate to severely advanced restrictive 
cardiomyopathy showed stabilization of disease as measured by left ventricular 
wall thickness, left ventricular mass (LVM), 6-min walk test (6MWT), and 
echocardiographic global systolic strain. IONIS-TTR℞ was well tolerated by all 
15 subjects and showed a good safety profile.
CONCLUSIONS: ASO treatment of patients with moderate to advanced ATTR 
cardiomyopathy shows indication of stabilization of disease progression and may 
therefore contribute to enhanced life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Since the release of the World Health Report in 2000, health 
system performance ranking studies have garnered significant health policy 
attention. However, this literature has produced variable results. The objective 
of this study was to synthesize the research and analyze the ranked performance 
of Canada's health system on the international stage.
METHOD: We conducted a scoping review exploring Canada's place in ranked health 
system performance among its peer Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development countries. Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage scoping review framework 
was adopted, yielding 48 academic and grey literature articles. A literature 
extraction tool was developed to gather information on themes that emerged from 
the literature.
SYNTHESIS: Although various methodologies were used to rank health system 
performance internationally, results generally suggested that Canada has been a 
middle-of-the-pack performer in overall health system performance for the last 
15 years. Canada's overall rankings were 7/191, 11/24, 10/11, 10/17, "Promising" 
and "B" grade across different studies. According to past literature, Canada 
performed well in areas of efficiency, productivity, attaining health system 
goals, years of life lived with disability and stroke mortality. By contrast, 
Canada performed poorly in areas related to disability-adjusted life expectancy, 
potential years of life lost, obesity in adults and children, diabetes, female 
lung cancer and infant mortality.
CONCLUSION: As countries introduce health system reforms aimed at improving the 
health of populations, international comparisons are useful to inform 
cross-country learning in health and social policy. While ranking systems do 
have shortcomings, they can serve to shine a spotlight on Canada's health system 
strengths and weaknesses to better inform the health policy agenda.

INTRODUCTION: Depuis le dépôt du Rapport sur la santé dans le monde, en 2000, 
les études sur la classification du rendement des systèmes de santé ont attiré 
l'attention politique. Cependant, cette littérature a produit des résultats 
variables. L'objectif de la présente étude est de synthétiser la recherche et 
d'analyser la classification du rendement du système de santé canadien par 
rapport à la scène internationale.
MÉTHODE: Nous avons mené un examen de la portée qui explore la place du Canada 
dans la classification du rendement des systèmes de santé parmi les pays de 
l'OCDE. Le cadre d'examen en 5 étapes d'Arksey et O'Malley a été utilisé, ce qui 
a permis de dégager 48 articles scientifiques et de la littérature grise. Un 
outil d'extraction de la littérature a été développé pour obtenir de 
l'information sur les thèmes qui ont émergé de la littérature.
SYNTHÈSE: Bien que plusieurs méthodologies aient été employées pour classifier 
le rendement international des systèmes de santé, les résultats suggèrent en 
général que le Canada se situe en milieu de peloton pour ce qui est du rendement 
général en santé, et ce, pour les 15 dernières années. Les classifications 
générales du Canada étaient 7/191, 11/24, 10/11, 10/17, « prometteur » et cote « 
B » selon les diverses études. La littérature antérieure indique que le 
rendement du Canada était bon dans les secteurs de l'efficience, de la 
productivité, de l'atteinte des objectifs du système de santé, des années de vie 
avec un handicap et de la mortalité due à un AVC. À l'opposé, le rendement du 
Canada est faible dans les secteurs liés à l'espérance de vie ajustée en 
fonction de l'incapacité, aux années potentielles de vie perdues, à l'obésité 
chez les adultes et les enfants, au diabète, au cancer du poumon chez les femmes 
et à la mortalité infantile.
CONCLUSION: Alors que les pays mettent en branle des réformes des systèmes de 
santé qui visent l'amélioration de la santé des populations, les comparaisons 
internationales sont utiles pour renseigner l'apprentissage entre pays sur la 
santé et sur les politiques sociales. Bien que la classification des systèmes 
présente certaines lacunes, elle peut servir à mettre en lumière les forces et 
faiblesses du système de santé canadien afin de mieux informer les politiques de 
santé.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and economic value of point-of-care CD4 
(POC-CD4) or viral load monitoring compared with current practices in 
Mozambique, a country representative of the diverse resource limitations 
encountered by HIV treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa.
DESIGN/METHODS: We use the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS 
Complications-International model to examine the clinical impact, cost (2014 
US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [$/year of life saved (YLS)] of 
ART monitoring strategies in Mozambique. We compare: monitoring for clinical 
disease progression [clinical ART monitoring strategy (CLIN)] vs. annual POC-CD4 
in rural settings without laboratory services and biannual laboratory CD4 
(LAB-CD4), biannual POC-CD4, and annual viral load in urban settings with 
laboratory services. We examine the impact of a range of values in sensitivity 
analyses, using Mozambique's 2014 per capita gross domestic product ($620) as a 
benchmark cost-effectiveness threshold.
RESULTS: In rural settings, annual POC-CD4 compared to CLIN improves life 
expectancy by 2.8 years, reduces time on failed ART by 0.6 years, and yields an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $480/YLS. In urban settings, biannual 
POC-CD4 is more expensive and less effective than viral load. Compared to 
biannual LAB-CD4, viral load improves life expectancy by 0.6 years, reduces time 
on failed ART by 1.0 year, and is cost-effective ($440/YLS).
CONCLUSION: In rural settings, annual POC-CD4 improves clinical outcomes and is 
cost-effective compared to CLIN. In urban settings, viral load has the greatest 
clinical benefit and is cost-effective compared to biannual POC-CD4 or LAB-CD4. 
Tailoring ART monitoring strategies to specific settings with different 
available resources can improve clinical outcomes while remaining economically 
efficient.

Are we ever too old?: Characteristics and outcome of octogenarians admitted to a 
medical intensive care unit.

The aging population increases the demand of intensive care unit (ICU) 
treatments. However, the availability of ICU beds is limited. Thus, ICU 
admission of octogenarians is considered controversial. The population above 80 
years is a very heterogeneous group though, and age alone might not be the best 
predictor. Aim of this study was to analyze resource consumption and outcome of 
octogenarians admitted to a medical ICU to identify reliable survival predictors 
in a senescent society.This retrospective observational study analyzes 930 
octogenarians and 5732 younger patients admitted to a medical ICU. Admission 
diagnosis, APACHE II and SAPS II scores, use of ICU resources, and mortality 
were recorded. Long-term mortality was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves and multivariate cox regression analysis.Patients ≥80 years old had 
higher SAPS II (43 vs 38, P < .001) and APACHE II (23 vs 21, P = .001) scores. 
Consumption of ICU resources by octogenarians was lower in terms of length of 
stay, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. Among 
octogenarians, ICU survivors got less mechanical ventilation or renal 
replacement therapy than nonsurvivors. Intra-ICU mortality in the very old was 
higher (19% vs 12%, P < .001) and long-term survival was lower (HR 1.76, 
P < .001). Multivariate cox regression analysis of octogenarians revealed that 
admission diagnosis of myocardial infarction (HR 1.713, P = .023), age (1.08, 
P = .002), and SAPS II score (HR 1.02, 95%, P = .01) were independent risk 
factors, whereas admission diagnoses monitoring post coronary intervention (HR 
.253, P = .002) and cardiac arrhythmia (HR .534, P = .032) had a substantially 
reduced mortality risk.Octogenarians show a higher intra-ICU and long-term 
mortality than younger patients. Still, they show a considerable life expectancy 
after ICU admission even though they get less invasive care than younger 
patients. Furthermore, some admission diagnoses like myocardial infarction, 
cardiac arrhythmia and monitoring post cardiac intervention are much stronger 
predictors for long-term survival than age or SAPS II score in the very old.

A nearly full-recovery from AVM hemorrhagic stroke 17 years after insult using a 
new integrated neurodevelopmental approach: A case report.

Terre Haute, IN, USA.

RATIONAL: With the prevalence of stroke increasing in the USA and the world 
along with increased survival and longevity due to medical advancements, it has 
become increasingly necessary to look at the chronic phase of stroke recovery. 
Previous paradigms of stroke treatment have proven ineffective when looking at 
10, 15, or 20 years of survival post insult.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient, being a young man just out of high school, was 
concerned with his overall morbidity. He was highly concerned with the quality 
of life he could expect as a stroke survivor with a life expectancy of 60 years 
or more.
DIAGNOSES: C was diagnosed with a hemorrhagic AVM stroke that impacted several 
regions of the brain, particularly the right occipital and temporal lobes as 
well as bilateral motor control. C experienced severe hpertonicity of the 
musculature and significant vertigo.
INTERVENTIONS: This study investigated a novel approach to chronic-phase stroke 
rehabilitation using traditional child motor-learning techniques, play, and 
proprioceptive-building activities in addition to current stroke rehabilitation 
techniques. During an initial six-month period, followed by a three-year period, 
the participant used motor-developmental learning activities as well as 
traditional strength, gait, and balance training. During the initial phase of 
treatment, clinically-significant improvements were recorded along with 
self-reported lifestyle enhancements. These gains continued throughout the 
three-and-a-half year process.
OUTCOMES: C regained the ability to free-walk in small bouts and went from the 
use of a walker to canes. He regained use of his hands and removed a large 
partion of his vertigo. Of specific interest was the participant's ability to 
progress from using a walker to driving, returning to school, and starting a 
family.
LESSONS: This study lays the groundwork for future studies into this type of 
therapeutic approach as well as highlighting the ability of chronic-phase stroke 
patients to recover well into the second decade post stroke. After the initial 
six month period, as gains were being observed, a more formal measurement 
process was begun for a second six-month period. Initial measurements of 
progress were taken every six weeks using the Fugl-Meyer test, the Berg Balance 
Test, the Barthel Index, and the Stroke Specific Quality Of Life scale. Results 
showed clinically significant improvements in all areas of recovery.

Establishing healthy habits in college is important for long-term health. 
Despite existing health promotion efforts, many college students fail to meet 
recommendations for behaviors such as healthy eating and exercise, which may be 
due to low perceived risk for health problems. The goals of this study were to 
examine: (1) the accuracy of life expectancy predictions, (2) potential 
individual differences in accuracy (i.e., gender and conscientiousness), and (3) 
potential change in accuracy after inducing awareness of current health 
behaviors. College students from a small northeastern university completed an 
electronic survey, including demographics, initial predictions of their life 
expectancy, and their recent health behaviors. At the end of the survey, 
participants were asked to predict their life expectancy a second time. Their 
health data were then submitted to a validated online algorithm to generate 
calculated life expectancy. Participants significantly overestimated their 
initial life expectancy, and neither gender nor conscientiousness was related to 
the accuracy of these predictions. Further, subjective life expectancy decreased 
from initial to final predictions. These findings suggest that life expectancy 
perceptions present a unique-and potentially modifiable-psychological process 
that could influence college students' self-care.

Home modification to reduce falls at a health district level: Modeling health 
gain, health inequalities and health costs.

Wellington, New Zealand.

BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that home safety assessment and modification 
(HSAM) is effective in reducing falls in older people. But there are various 
knowledge gaps, including around cost-effectiveness and also the impacts at a 
health district-level.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A previously established Markov macro-simulation model 
built for the whole New Zealand (NZ) population (Pega et al 2016, Injury 
Prevention) was enhanced and adapted to a health district level. This district 
was Counties Manukau District Health Board, which hosts 42,000 people aged 65+ 
years. A health system perspective was taken and a discount rate of 3% was used 
for both health gain and costs. Intervention effectiveness estimates came from a 
systematic review, and NZ-specific intervention costs were extracted from a 
randomized controlled trial. In the 65+ age-group in this health district, the 
HSAM program was estimated to achieve health gains of 2800 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 547 to 5280). The net health 
system cost was estimated at NZ$8.44 million (95% UI: $663 to $14.3 million). 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at NZ$5480 
suggesting HSAM is cost-effective (95%UI: cost saving to NZ$15,300 [equivalent 
to US$10,300]). Targeting HSAM only to people age 65+ or 75+ with previous 
injurious falls was estimated to be particularly cost-effective (ICERs: $700 and 
$832, respectively) with the latter intervention being cost-saving. There was no 
evidence for differential cost-effectiveness by sex or by ethnicity: Māori 
(Indigenous population) vs non-Māori.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study suggests that a HSAM program could produce 
considerable health gain and be cost-effective for older people at a health 
district level. Nevertheless, comparisons may be desirable with other falls 
prevention interventions such as group exercise programs, which also provide 
social contact and may prevent various chronic diseases.

Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) in vertebrates contains a N-terminal 
extension in front of the catalytic core. Proteolytic removal of the N-terminal 
93 amino acids gives rise to T2-TrpRS, which has potent anti-angiogenic activity 
mediated through its extracellular interaction with VE-cadherin. Zinc has been 
shown to have anti-angiogenic effects and can bind to human TrpRS. However, the 
connection between zinc and the anti-angiogenic function of TrpRS has not been 
explored. Here we report that zinc binding can induce structural relaxation in 
human TrpRS to facilitate the proteolytic generation of a T2-TrpRS-like 
fragment. The zinc-binding site is likely to be contained within T2-TrpRS, and 
the zinc-bound conformation of T2-TrpRS is mimicked by mutation H130R. We 
determined the crystal structure of H130R T2-TrpRS at 2.8 Å resolution, which 
reveals drastically different conformation from that of wild-type (WT) T2-TrpRS. 
The conformational change creates larger binding surfaces for VE-cadherin as 
suggested by molecular dynamic simulations. Surface plasmon resonance analysis 
indicates more than 50-fold increase in binding affinity of H130R T2-TrpRS for 
VE-cadherin, compared to WT T2-TrpRS. The enhanced interaction is also confirmed 
by a cell-based binding analysis. These results suggest that zinc plays an 
important role in activating TrpRS for angiogenesis regulation.

Environmental or social challenges can stimulate a cascade of coordinated 
physiological changes in stress response systems. Unfortunately, chronic 
activation of these adaptations under conditions such as low socioeconomic 
status (SES) can have negative consequences for long-term health. While there is 
substantial evidence tying low SES to increased disease risk and reduced life 
expectancy, the underlying biology remains poorly understood. Using pilot data 
on 120 older adults from the Health and Retirement Study (United States, 
2002-2010), we examined the associations between SES and gene expression levels 
in adulthood, with particular focus on a gene expression program known as the 
conserved transcriptional response to adversity. We also used a 
bioinformatics-based approach to assess the activity of specific gene regulation 
pathways involved in inflammation, antiviral responses, and stress-related 
neuroendocrine signaling. We found that low SES was related to increased 
expression of conserved transcriptional response to adversity genes and distinct 
patterns of proinflammatory, antiviral, and stress signaling (e.g., sympathetic 
nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) transcription factor 
activation.

OBJECTIVE: Although type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease and mortality, information on its association with mortality and life 
expectancy according to cardiovascular comorbidities is limited, especially in 
Asia. Thus, this study assessed mortality and reductions in life expectancy 
associated with cardiometabolic multimorbidity.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 569,831 participants older than 30 years from 
Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort were enrolled 
between 2002 and 2006 and followed for a median of 12.0 years. They were 
categorized into five mutually exclusive groups according to baseline disease 
status, as follows: none (reference group); diabetes only; diabetes and stroke; 
diabetes and myocardial infarction (MI); and diabetes, stroke, and MI. Mortality 
rates and hazard ratios (HRs), reductions of life expectancy, and age-specific 
contributions to life expectancy were calculated by constructing life tables.
RESULTS: The mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 6.85, 19.86, 67.17, 
66.34, and 115.52 in the reference, diabetes only; diabetes and stroke; diabetes 
and MI; and diabetes, stroke, and MI groups, respectively. The corresponding HRs 
for all-cause mortality were 1.70 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.66 to 1.75], 
3.66 (95% CI, 3.32 to 4.03), 3.56 (95% CI, 3.06 to 4.14), and 4.79 (95% CI, 3.05 
to 7.50) compared with the reference group. The estimated reductions in life 
expectancy were greater at younger ages and markedly increased with more 
cardiometabolic comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: Young Asians with type 2 diabetes, especially those with 
cardiovascular comorbidity, did not live as long than their nondiabetic 
equivalents. Thus, these individuals require special attention to prevent 
further reductions in life expectancy.

Cardio-oncology is a new and rapidly expanding field that merges cancer and 
cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is an omnipresent side effect of 
cancer therapy; in fact, it is the second leading cause of death in cancer 
survivors after recurrent cancer. It has been well documented that many cancer 
chemotherapeutic agents cause cardiovascular toxicity. Nonetheless, the 
underlying cause of cancer therapy-induced cardiovascular toxicity is largely 
unknown. In this review, we discuss the potential role of damage-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs) as an underlying contributor to cancer 
therapy-induced cardiovascular toxicity. With an increasing number of cancer 
patients, as well as extended life expectancy, understanding the mechanisms 
underlying cancer therapy-induced cardiovascular disease is of the utmost 
importance to ensure that cancer is the only disease burden that cancer 
survivors have to endure.

The fruit of Sageretia theezans is one of many underutilized edible fruits that 
grow along the southern seashores of East Asia. In this study, to evaluate the 
nutritional and nutraceutical values of S. theezans fruit, the composition of 
minerals, organic acids, and proximate and fatty acids, the total phenolic, 
total flavonoid, and total anthocyanin content, and the antioxidant and 
antidiabetic activities of S. theezans fruit were analyzed. The results indicate 
that S. theezans fruit could be classified as a potential potassium-, malic 
acid-, and linoleic/oleic acid-rich fruit. In addition, The ethyl acetate 
(EtOAc) fraction of the 70% ethanol (EtOH) crude extract exhibited strong 
antioxidant activities including free radical scavenging and reducing power 
activities compared with the same concentration of butylated hydroxytoluene. 
Furthermore, the EtOAc fraction showed significant inhibition of α-glucosidase 
activity. The analysis of the total phenolic and flavonoid content suggested 
that the remarkable antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of the EtOAc 
fraction are due to the presence of high levels of polyphenolic compounds.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. It 
usually has a comparatively benign course. If properly executed, radioiodine 
therapy can provide an effective treatment of even advanced, metastatic DTC. A 
major problem in determining the right RAI for a patient with metastatic disease 
is a comparative lack of evidence. There are no reports on randomized controlled 
trials in this patient group which can aid us in determining which way to treat 
which patient. Few non-randomized prospective observational studies have been 
performed. Most available evidence is based on retrospective analyses which, 
although often informative, still are hampered by the selection bias inherent to 
retrospective studies on a small, preselected sample of the total DTC 
population. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the 
relevant literature on the issues pertinent to the execution of RAI. Radioiodine 
therapy of metastatic DTC in patients can be an effective treatment modality 
which will contribute significantly to a patients' life expectancy. However, 
much is unclear in the management of this malignancy, including which activity 
to use, how to determine this activity (empiric vs. dosimetric approach) as well 
as the potential long-term complications. In pediatric patients, special 
considerations apply with regard to weight-adaptation of activities as well the 
risk of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with diffuse miliary metastases.
