there has been increasing evidence of the existence of a relationship between 
energy metabolism and neurodegeneration, with reports that type 2 diabetes 
mellitus increases the risk of AD. Evidence from preclinical and epidemiologic 
studies has associated dysmetabolism and dysmetabolic syndromes with the 
development of neurodegenerative changes. More recently, diabetes mellitus and 
energy dysmetabolism have been linked to the aetiopathogenesis of AD. Moreover, 
metabolic hormones, including ghrelin, leptin, insulin, and insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF)-1, have been reported to play key roles in the regulation of 
neuronal injury and loss in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. In this 
narrative review, we examine the current scientific evidence regarding the role 
of dysmetabolism (including diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome) in AD and 
how it impacts disease progression and the development of novel therapies in AD.

BACKGROUND: The immunopathogenesis of dengue virus (DENV) infection remains 
incompletely understood. To increase our understanding of inflammatory response 
in non-severe dengue, we assessed longitudinal changes in the inflammatory 
proteome in patients with an acute DENV infection.
METHODS: Using a multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA), we measured relative 
levels of 368 inflammatory markers in plasma samples from hospitalized patients 
with non-severe DENV infection in the acute (n = 43) and convalescence (n = 35) 
phase of the infection and samples of healthy controls (n = 10).
RESULTS: We identified 203 upregulated and 39 downregulated proteins in acute 
versus convalescent plasma samples. The upregulated proteins had a strong 
representation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible effector proteins, 
cytokines (e.g. IL-10, IL-33) and cytokine receptors, chemokines, pro-apoptotic 
proteins (e.g. granzymes) and endothelial markers. A number of differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs) have not been reported in previous studies. Functional 
network analysis highlighted a central role for IFNγ, IL-10, IL-33 and 
chemokines. We identified different novel associations between inflammatory 
proteins and circulating concentrations of the endothelial glycocalyx disruption 
surrogate marker syndecan-1. Conclusion: This unbiased proteome analysis 
provides a comprehensive insight in the inflammatory response in DENV infection 
and its association with glycocalyx disruption.

We modified and extended laminoplasty to the upper cervical spine on patients 
with canal stenosis associated with upper cervical spinal ossified lesions. 
However, whether the extended decompression range of laminoplasty can cause 
further effects on cervical stability is rarely studied at present. A 
retrospective study to analyze the relationship between the surgical levels and 
cervical sagittal parameters effects was performed in patients with cervical 
spondylosis myelopathy who had undergone posterior cervical expansive open-door 
laminoplasty with/without extending to C2. In total, 64 patients were divided 
into 2 groups according to the surgical levels. Radiologic outcomes of 
occipito-cervical angle (C0-2 Cobb angle), CL C27 Cobb angle, cervical sagittal 
vertical alignment, T1-Slope (T1S), T1S minus CL (T1S-CL), spino-cranial angle 
and center of the sella turcica-C7 SVA (St-SVA) were evaluated on lateral X-rays 
of the cervical spine at pre-operation, post-operation, and 2-year follow-up. 
The patient's health-related quality of life was obtained including neck 
disability index, Japanese orthopaedic association scores, and visual analog 
scale. Changes in sagittal parameters were observed in both groups after 
surgery. T1S, cervical sagittal vertical alignment, and T1S-CL significantly 
increased and CL decreased in 2 groups of patients postoperative. After a 2-year 
follow-up period, the C0-2 Cobb angle was found to increase compared to 
preoperative records. In addition, there were no significant differences in 
spino-cranial angle and st-SVA between preoperative and 2 years follow-up 
measurements. Health-related quality of life was improved in both groups and was 
not significantly different. Herein, the parameters indicated a tilting forward 
of the lower cervical spine and a more lordotic upper cervical spine to maintain 
a horizontal gaze in patients. However, C2 to 7 laminoplasty was performed to 
achieve satisfactory clinical results without significantly changing the spinal 
sagittal parameters.

BACKGROUND: Assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of infliximab, 
cyclosporine and tacrolimus for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: A literature search identified studies that investigated infliximab, 
cyclosporine or tacrolimus compared with placebo in UC patients. Short-term, 
long-term remission rates and response rates were employed to assess efficacy. 
Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were analyzed. A Markov model was 
constructed to simulate the progression in a cohort of patients with UC, with an 
over 10 years of time horizon, with a discount rate of 3%, and established 
threshold of €30,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) or ¥82442/QALY.
RESULTS: Results of network meta-analysis showed that the order was 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, infliximab and placebo from high rate to low with 
regard to short-term clinical response. The comparison between infliximab versus 
cyclosporine achieved an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
€184435/QALY and ¥531607/QALY, with a 0.34893 QALYs difference of efficacy, and 
an incremental cost of €64355 and ¥185494. Tacrolimus versus cyclosporine 
reached an ICER of €44236/QALY and ¥57494/QALY, with a difference of 0.40963 
QALYs in efficacy, and a raising cost to €18120 and ¥23551. The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis shows that cyclosporine would be cost-effective in the 
75.8% of the simulations, tacrolimus in the 24.2%, and infliximab for the 0%.
CONCLUSION: Infliximab, cyclosporine and tacrolimus as salvage therapies are 
efficacious. For long-term of clinical remission, the order of pharmacological 
agents was tacrolimus, infliximab and cyclosporine from high efficacy to low 
while no significant difference is seen. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the 
cyclosporine versus infliximab or tacrolimus is expected to be at best.

Fishes are highly perishable, mainly stored and transported under frozen 
condition; however, they are mainly preferred as fresh or in chilled form for 
consumption because frozen storage compromises the texture quality and other 
sensory attributes. Shelf-life enhancement of rohu and seer fish steaks was 
studied using combination of ajwain extract (various concentrations) and 
γ-irradiation (various doses) under chilled storage (4 °C). These were analyzed 
periodically by microbiological, sensory, color and biochemical analyses during 
storage. Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed thymol 
as major component. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis 
showed the presence of nine phenolic compounds including thymol in ajwain 
extract. The best result was achieved when samples were dipped in 10 % ajwain 
extract with 2 kGy gamma irradiation dose. An extended shelf-life of 5 and 
10 days in case of rohu and seer fish steaks were attained respectively using 
this combination. These results were confirmed by microbial, biochemical and 
sensory analyses. The present study thus promises potential application of the 
above protocol in fishery industry for good quality of fish and commercial 
benefits.

University, Nanchang (Dr. Li), China. Electronic address: zhenghongsci@163.com.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of different strategies, 
including the dienogest (DNG) and combined oral contraceptives (COC) therapy, 
for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence after surgery.
DESIGN: A decision tree model was created. The analysis was based on data from a 
healthcare provider in China. Model inputs were derived from published data. The 
end points included incremental cost effectiveness ratio, net monetary benefit 
(NMB), and incremental NMB associated with prevention of recurrence. The 
uncertainty was assessed through one way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 
The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 2022 checklist 
was used to assess quality of the reporting.
SETTING: China healthcare system.
PATIENTS: Individuals undergoing laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.
INTERVENTIONS: DNG vs COC.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that hormone 
supression via DNG resulted in 0.7493 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a 
cost of $1625.49 compared with COC, which resulted in 0.7346 QALYs at a cost of 
$343.61. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was $87 679.89 per additional 
QALY gained and the DNG treatment was associated with an incremental NMB of 
-$731.39. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that DNG is not 
cost-effective in most cases at a threshold consistent with World Health 
Organisation recommendations of $37 653/QALY.
CONCLUSION: The result of our present analysis suggests that the DNG might not 
be cost-effective for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence after surgery 
in China.

Various factors affect the prognosis of dialysis patients. Analysis of the drugs 
used and clinical and demographic characteristics of the patient at the time of 
dialysis initiation is a useful means of estimating prognosis. In this study, we 
investigated the drugs used by dialysis patients during the induction phase of 
dialysis and performed a detailed analysis of variables predictive of prognosis. 
Patients who underwent dialysis between June 1998 and January 2019 and died 
during this period were included in the study (n = 118). The induction phase of 
dialysis was defined as the first month after dialysis began. Dialysis duration 
was defined as the time between dialysis initiation and death. A univariate 
regression analysis was performed, with dialysis duration as the objective 
variable and the drugs used during the induction phase of dialysis, blood 
laboratory values, age at start of dialysis, sex, body height, body weight, 
medical history and cause of death as the explanatory variables. In addition, 
multiple logistic regression analysis with stepwise variable selection of 
significant factors was performed to determine the factors related to dialysis 
duration. Antihypertensives, hemoglobin (Hb), and age at start of dialysis were 
found to have significant effects on dialysis duration. It was posited that 
antihypertensives prolong dialysis duration, thereby improving life expectancy. 
The regression model developed allowed estimation of prognosis based on the 
drugs used during the induction phase of dialysis and patient characteristics. 
These findings may be used to improve drug adherence in dialysis patients and 
guide physicians in their treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact on diagnosis targets, cost, and 
cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B screening in Australia.
DESIGN: Markov model simulation of disease and care cascade progression for 
people with chronic hepatitis B in Australia.
SETTING: Three scenarios were compared: 1. no change to current hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) testing practice; 2. universal screening strategy, with the aim of 
achieving the WHO diagnosis target by 2030 (90% of people with chronic hepatitis 
B diagnosed), based on opportunistic (general practitioner-initiated) screening 
for HBsAg; 3. universal screening strategy, and also ensuring that 50% of people 
with chronic hepatitis B are receiving appropriate clinical management by 2030.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Projected care cascade for people with chronic hepatitis 
B, cumulative number of HBV-related deaths, intervention costs, and health 
utility (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] gained during 2020-2030). An 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold (v scenario 1) of $50 000 
per QALY gained was applied.
RESULTS: Compared with scenario 1, 80 HBV-related deaths (interquartile range 
[IQR], 41-127 deaths) were averted during 2020-2030 in scenario 2, 315 
HBV-related deaths (IQR, 211-454 deaths) in scenario 3. Scenario 2 cost 
$84 million (IQR, $41-106 million) more than scenario 1 during 2020-2030 (+8%), 
yielding an ICER of $104 921 (IQR, $49 587-107 952) per QALY gained. Scenario 3 
cost $263 million (IQR, $214-316 million) more than scenario 1 during 2020-2030 
(+24%), yielding an ICER of $47 341 (IQR, $32 643-58 200) per QALY gained. 
Scenario 3 remained cost-effective if the test positivity rate was higher than 
0.35% or the additional costs per person tested did not exceed $4.02.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening for hepatitis B will be cost-effective only if 
the cost of testing is kept low and people receive appropriate clinical 
management.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Global distribution of dominant liver cancer aetiologies has 
significantly changed over the past decades. This study analyzed the updated 
temporal trends of liver cancer aetiologies and sociodemographic status in 204 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease 2019 report was used for statistical 
analysis. In addition, we performed stratification analysis to five quintiles 
using sociodemographic index and 21 geographic regions.
RESULTS: The crude numbers of liver cancer disease-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
and deaths significantly increased during the study period (DALYs; 11,278,630 in 
1990 and 12,528,422 in 2019, deaths; 365,215 in 1990 and 484,577 in 2019). 
However, the Age-standardized DALY and mortality rates decreased. Hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) remains the leading cause of liver cancer DALYs and mortality, 
followed by hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol consumption, and non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH/NAFLD). Although 
Age-standardized DALY and mortality rates of liver cancer due to HBV and HCV 
have decreased, the rates due to alcohol consumption and NASH/NAFLD have 
increased. In 2019, the population of the East Asia region had the highest 
Age-standardized DALY and mortality rates, followed by high-income Asia-Pacific 
and Central Asia populations. Although East Asia and high-income Asia-Pacific 
regions showed a decrease during the study period, Age-standardized DALY rates 
increased in Central Asia. High-income North American and Australasian 
populations also showed a significant increase in Age-standardized DALY.
CONCLUSION: Liver cancer remains an ongoing global threat. The burden of liver 
cancer associated with alcohol consumption and NASH/NAFLD is markedly increasing 
and projected to continuously increase.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is one of the most severe complications in 
patients with advanced ovarian cancer, with an estimated incidence up to 50%. 
Its presence is related to poor prognosis and a life expectancy measured in 
weeks for inoperable cases. Symptoms are usually difficult to manage and often 
require hospitalization, which carries a high burden on patients, caregivers and 
the healthcare system. Management is complex and requires a multidisciplinary 
approach to improve clinical outcomes. Patients with inoperable MBO are treated 
medically with analgesics, antiemetics, steroids and antisecretory agents. 
Parenteral nutrition and gut decompression with nasogastric tube, venting 
gastrostomy or stenting may be used as supportive therapy. Treatment 
decision-making is challenging and often based on clinical expertise and local 
policies, with lack of high-quality evidence to optimally standardize 
management. The present review summarizes current literature on inoperable bowel 
obstruction in ovarian cancer, focusing on epidemiology, prognostic factors, 
clinical outcomes, medical management, multidisciplinary interventions and 
quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: C2 slope (C2S), a cervical parameter mathematically approximated as 
T1 slope minus cervical lordosis (T1S-CL), predicts functional improvement in 
cervical deformity patients. Nonetheless, C2S is a positional parameter based 
only on the horizontal axis. The current study aims to introduce novel odontoid 
parameters and establish their relationships with patient-reported 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHODS: Lateral plain radiographs of 32 adults who underwent multilevel 
posterior cervical fusion were analyzed. The odontoid parameters included 
odontoid incidence (OI), C2S, odontoid tilt (OT), and gravity line-C2 distance 
(GL-C2), while the cervical parameters were the Cobb angle at C0-1, C1-2, C0-2, 
C2-7, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (cSVA), T1 slope, and T1S-CL. The range of 
motion (ROM) of the occipito-atlantoaxial complex was measured in flexion and 
extension plain radiographs. Scores on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and 
visual analogue scale (VAS) for axial neck (VASn) and arm pain were measured.
RESULTS: Compared to asymptomatic subjects, patients had larger C2S, cSVA, and 
T1S-CL, and smaller OT. Preoperatively, OI was significantly correlated with the 
ROM of C1-2 (r = 0.37, p < 0.05) and C0-2 (r = 0.46, p < 0.01). OT and C2S had 
significant correlations with the C0-1, C1-2, and C0-2 angles, GL-C2, and 
T1S-CL. Postoperative NDI scores were significantly correlated with OI (r = 
-0.40, p < 0.05) and OT (ρ = -0.37, p < 0.05). VASn was significantly correlated 
with GL-C2 (r = -0.35, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The odontoid parameters were significantly correlated with 
established cervical parameters and HRQoL measures. OI is a constant parameter 
representing the individual's compensatory reservoir at the upper cervical 
spine.

BACKGROUND: Digital technologies were implemented to address the disruption of 
long-term care facility residents' socialization needs during the COVID-19 
pandemic. A literature review regarding this topic is needed to inform public 
policy, facility managers, family caregivers, and nurses and allied health 
professionals involved in mediating the use of digital devices for residents' 
social ties.
OBJECTIVE: Our study outlines key concepts, methodologies, results, issues, and 
gaps in articles published during pandemic-related visitation restrictions.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol, a scoping 
review was conducted by searching 3 database aggregator platforms (EBSCO, 
ProQuest, and PubMed) for studies published in peer-reviewed journals from early 
2020 to the end of June 2021, when the most stringent restrictions were in 
place. We included qualitative and quantitative studies, reviews, commentaries, 
viewpoints, and letters to the editors in French or English focusing on digital 
technologies aiming to support the social contact of residents in long-term care 
facilities during pandemic-related visitation restrictions.
RESULTS: Among 763 screened articles, 29 met our selection criteria. For each 
study, we characterized the (1) authors, title, and date of the publication; (2) 
country of the first author; (3) research fields; (4) article type; and (5) type 
of technology mentioned. The analysis distinguished 3 main themes emerging from 
the literature: (1) impact and expectations of remote social contact on the 
physical and mental health and well-being of the residents (n=12), (2) with whom 
or what the social contact took place (n=17), and (3) limitations and barriers 
to significant social contact related to digital technologies (n=14). The 
results first underlined the highly positive impact expected by the authors of 
the digital technologies on health and quality of life of residents of long-term 
care facilities. Second, they highlighted the plurality of ties to consider, 
since social contact takes place not only with family caregivers to maintain 
contact but also for other purposes (end-of-life videoconferences) and with 
other types of contact (eg, with staff and robots). Third, they exposed the 
limitations and barriers to significant contact using digital technologies and 
outlined the required conditions to enable them.
CONCLUSIONS: The review demonstrated the opportunities and risks outlined by the 
literature about the implementation of digital technologies to support remote 
social contact. It showed the plurality of ties to consider and revealed the 
need to evaluate the positive impact of remote contact from the residents' 
perspectives. Therefore, to go beyond the risk of digital solutionism, there is 
a need for studies considering the holistic impact on health regarding the 
implementation of digital technologies, including the meaning residents give to 
interpersonal exchanges and the organizational constraints.

OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive 
disease that, if left untreated, shortens the life expectancy of patients. 
Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as macitentan and bosentan, play an 
essential role in improving the patient's symptoms, quality of life, and life 
expectancy. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of macitentan compared 
with bosentan in treating PAH from the health system perspective in Iran.
METHODS: For evaluating the cost-effectiveness of macitentan, a Markov model 
consisting of 5 states, functional class (FC) I, FC II, FC III, FC IV, and 
death, was designed using the TreeAge software. The lifetime time horizon and a 
3-month cycle length were set. Patients entered the model from FC II or FC III 
states based on the initial probabilities. Costs were measured in US dollars 
(USD), and outcomes were measured in terms of quality quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was calculated. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed to 
determine the robustness of the model by examining the possible effects of 
uncertainties on the final result.
RESULTS: The costs of treatment with macitentan and bosentan in PAH in Iran were 
calculated at 19 429 and 17 246 USD, and the outcomes were 4.02 and 3.04 QALYs, 
respectively. Therefore, ICER was calculated at 2233.46 USD/QALY. One-way 
sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the model is robust; nevertheless, it is 
most sensitive to the price of macitentan and bosentan.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with macitentan was associated with both higher costs and 
QALYs than bosentan. Nevertheless, it is considered the cost-effective treatment 
strategy in Iran given that the calculated ICER falls below the willingness to 
pay threshold.

Main target in palliative care (PC) is burden care of patients and their 
families, with the aim to reduce suffering through the management of symptoms, 
rehabilitation, psychosocial issues, and spiritual well-being, using a 
multidisciplinary approach. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease which 
induces physical and psychosocial symptoms, with a significant impact on the 
quality of life. As a consequence, despite advances in research in 
disease-modifying drugs, MS remains a life-limiting disease with symptoms 
negatively impacting the lives of MS patients and their families. PC has been 
developed for end-of-life treatment in oncology, being little used in MS. 
Specific issues in MS, like pain due to spasticity, requires a different 
approach respect to cancer pain management. Moreover, it is difficult to 
anticipate life expectancy in people with severe MS, who often need palliative 
care for a long extended period. PC teams are trained to keep open full and 
competent lines of communication about symptoms and disease progression, 
advanced care planning, and end-of-life issues and wishes. Many studies 
investigated the effects of home-based PC in advanced MS, showing weak evidences 
about the efficacy of PC versus usual care in MS. However, current evidence does 
not support or refute the routine use of PC interventions for people with MS.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of gelatin matrix with 
human thrombin (GMHT) on blood loss and survival time in patients with 
metastatic spinal tumors treated with palliative decompression surgery with 
posterior spinal fusion.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 67 consecutive patients with metastatic 
spinal tumors who underwent palliative decompression surgery with posterior 
spinal fusion. We compared patients in whom GMHT was not used during surgery 
with those in whom GMHT was used. The following baseline characteristics were 
evaluated: age, height, weight, sex, metastatic tumor diagnosis, medical 
history, use of antiplatelet drug, use of anticoagulant drug, use of NSAIDs, 
smoking, preoperative PLT value, preoperative APTT, preoperative PT-INR, 
Karnofsky Performance Status score, Charlson comorbidities index score, the 
percentage of patients who received perioperative chemotherapy, main tumor 
level, Frankel category, revised Tokuhashi score, spinal instability neoplastic 
score (SINS), number of fusion segments, operation time, intraoperative blood 
loss, drainage blood loss, red blood cell transfusion, hemoglobin level, total 
protein (TP), albumin values, total blood loss (TBL), hidden blood loss, 
postoperative bed rest and postoperative survival time. Perioperative 
complications were assessed.
RESULTS: Age, height, weight, sex, metastatic tumor diagnosis, medical history, 
use of antiplatelet drug, use of anticoagulant drug, use of NSAIDs, smoking, 
preoperative PLT value, preoperative APTT, preoperative PT-INR, CCI score, main 
level of tumors, SINS score, preoperative Tokuhashi score and number of fusion 
segments did not differ significantly between the two groups. Operation time, 
intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage blood loss, and TBL were 
significantly decreased in the group with GMHT than in the group without GMHT. 
The total number of perioperative complications was significantly lesser in the 
group with GMHT than in the group without GMHT. The median postoperative 
survival time was significantly longer in the GMHT group than in the group 
without GMHT.
CONCLUSION: GMHT should be considered a valid option for the treatment of 
patients with metastatic spinal tumors with a short life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) cause substantial mortality and 
morbidity. The present study reported and analysed the burden of LRIs in the 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex, 
etiology, and socio-demographic index (SDI).
METHODS: The data used in this study were sourced from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study 2019. The annual incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) due to LRIs were presented as counts and age-standardised 
rates per 100,000 population, along with their 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). 
The average annual percent changes (AAPC) in the age-standardised incidence, 
death and DALYs rates were calculated using Joinpoint software and correlations 
(Pearson's correlation coefficient) between the AAPCs and SDIs were calculated 
using Stata software.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 34.1 million (95% UI 31.7-36.8) incident cases of 
LRIs in MENA, with an age-standardised rate of 6510.2 (95% UI 6063.6-6997.8) per 
100,000 population. The number of regional DALYs was 4.7 million (95% UI 
3.9-5.4), with an age-standardised rate of 888.5 (95% UI 761.1-1019.9) per 
100,000 population, which has decreased since 1990. Furthermore, Egypt [8150.8 
(95% UI 7535.8-8783.5)] and Afghanistan [61.9 (95% UI 52.1-72.6)] had the 
highest age-standardised incidence and death rates, respectively. In 2019, the 
regional incidence and DALY rates were highest in the 1-4 age group, in both 
females and males. In terms of deaths, pneumococcus and H. influenza type B were 
the most and least common types of LRIs, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the 
burden of LRIs generally decreased with increasing SDI. There were significant 
positive correlations between SDI and the AAPCs for the age-standardised 
incidence, death and DALY rates (p < 0.05). Over the 1990-2019 period, the 
regional incidence, deaths and DALYs attributable to LRIs decreased with AAPCs 
of - 1.19% (- 1.25 to - 1.13), - 2.47% (- 2.65 to - 2.28) and - 4.21% (- 4.43 to 
- 3.99), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The LRI-associated burden in the MENA region decreased between 1990 
and 2019. SDI had a significant positive correlation with the AAPC and 
pneumococcus was the most common underlying cause of LRIs. Afghanistan, Yemen 
and Egypt had the largest burdens in 2019. Further studies are needed to 
investigate the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and programs to 
control LRIs and their risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: A longer life expectancy increases the number of older adults who 
require long-term care. The presence of a caregiver at home prevents the 
placement of older adults in care facilities. Identifying the caregivers' 
viewpoints around the care clarifies key factors in providing quality care.This 
study aimed to assess barriers to home care from the perspective of Iranian 
informal caregivers of older adults.
DESIGN: This was a qualitative study with content analysis. Semistructured 
interviews were conducted via telephone in Persian with informal caregivers of 
older adults using open-ended questions.
SETTING: Social and health organisations in southern Tehran, Iran.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen informal caregivers were selected on purpose. 
Participants were eligible to participate in the study if they were 18 years or 
older, and had at least 1 month of care experience for a minimum of 6 hours per 
week.
RESULTS: Barriers to home care for older adults from informal caregivers' points 
of view were categorised into three domains: (1) Individual barriers include the 
physical, mental and social burden of care as well as personal characteristics 
of the caregiver; (2) interpersonal barriers include psychobehavioural 
characteristics of the older adult and misbehaviour of people around the 
caregiver and (3) care system barriers include inefficient 
institutional/organisational infrastructure, moral issues and inefficiency in 
public policy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed multiple individual, interpersonal and care system 
barriers to home care for older adults. Specific contextual challenges among 
Iranian caregivers, such as their attitudes and beliefs, as well as a lack of 
social and healthcare support for families, hindered the quality of care.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the burden of multiple sclerosis disease indicators in the 
Asia-Pacific countries, China and globally through the Global Burden of Disease 
2019 (GBD2019) Database, and to analyse the changes of multiple sclerosis 
disease burden in China from 1990 to 2019.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study based on the Global Burden of Disease.
SETTING: The relevant incidence, prevalence, death and disability-adjusted life 
year (DALY) rates and corresponding age-standardised rates (ASRs) and 
sociodemographic index (SDI) in China, globally and in Asia-Pacific countries 
were extracted from the GBD2019 Database to further study the age-standardised 
incidence, prevalence and mortality, and the relationship between DALY rate and 
SDI.
RESULTS: Various disease burden indicators of multiple sclerosis in China are at 
low level in the world, and the prevalence, incidence and DALY rates have slowly 
increased from 1990 to 2019. During this period, the age-standardised prevalence 
rate (ASPR) of multiple sclerosis in China showed an upward trend, while the 
age-standardised death rate (ASDR), age-standardised DALY rate (ASR-DALY) and 
age-standardised incidence rate all decreased to varying degrees, which were 
roughly consistent with the global amplitude changes, and all indicators are 
similar to most countries in the Asia-Pacific region. As the value of the SDI 
increases, the ASPR of multiple sclerosis was trending upward, and the ASDR was 
trending downward.
CONCLUSION: Compared with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, China is 
in a low state of disease burden indicators. However, as a developing country 
and the most populous country in the world, the total number of patients is not 
small, and as a rare disease, the treatment cost is relatively expensive, and 
the treatment cost of the complications caused by the disease is not low. The 
construction of the medical security system should be strengthened to reduce its 
burden on individuals, families and society.
