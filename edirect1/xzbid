on statin protocol recruitment. The parent study completed recruitment of 381 
patients. Site enrollment ranged from 1 to 109 participants, with an average of 
25 enrolled per site. Five major barriers included difficulty locating eligible 
patients, severity of illness, family and provider protectiveness, seeking 
patients in multiple settings, and lack of resources for recruitment activities. 
Five effective recruitment strategies included systematic screening of patient 
lists, thoughtful messaging to make research relevant, flexible protocols to 
accommodate patients' needs, support from clinical champions, and the additional 
resources of a trials cooperative group.
CONCLUSION: The recruitment experience from the multisite PCRC yields new 
insights into methods for effective recruitment to palliative care clinical 
trials. These results will inform training materials for the PCRC and may assist 
other investigators in the field.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the 
national burden of cerebrovascular diseases in the adult population of Spain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, descriptive population-based study. We 
calculated the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) metric using 
country-specific data from national statistics and epidemiological studies to 
obtain representative outcomes for the Spanish population. DALYs were divided 
into years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years of life 
lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were estimated for the year 2008 by applying 
demographic structure by sex and age-groups, cause-specific mortality, morbidity 
data and new disability weights proposed in the recent Global Burden of Disease 
study. In the base case, neither YLLs nor YLDs were discounted or age-weighted. 
Uncertainty around DALYs was tested using sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In Spain, cerebrovascular diseases generated 418,052 DALYs, comprising 
337,000 (80.6%) YLLs and 81,052 (19.4%) YLDs. This accounts for 1,113 DALYs per 
100,000 population (men: 1,197 and women: 1,033) and 3,912 per 100,000 in those 
over the age of 65 years (men: 4,427 and women: 2,033). Depending on the 
standard life table and choice of social values used for calculation, total 
DALYs varied by 15.3% and 59.9% below the main estimate.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimates provided here represent a comprehensive analysis of the 
burden of cerebrovascular diseases at a national level. Prevention and control 
programmes aimed at reducing the disease burden merit further priority in Spain.

Background. Increasing body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk 
of mortality; however, quantifying weight gain in men undergoing androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PC) remains unexplored. Methods. 
Between 1995 and 2001, 206 men were enrolled in a randomized trial evaluating 
the survival difference of adding 6 months of ADT to radiation therapy (RT). BMI 
measurements were available in 171 men comprising the study cohort. The primary 
endpoint was weight gain of ≥10 lbs by 6-month followup. Logistic regression 
analysis was performed to assess whether baseline BMI or treatment received was 
associated with this endpoint adjusting for known prognostic factors. Results. 
By the 6-month followup, 12 men gained ≥10 lbs, of which 10 (83%) received RT + 
ADT and, of these, 7 (70%) were obese at randomization. Men treated with RT as 
compared to RT + ADT were less likely to gain ≥10 lbs (adjusted odds ratio 
(AOR): 0.18 [95% CI: 0.04-0.89]; P = 0.04), whereas this risk increased with 
increasing BMI (AOR: 1.15 [95% CI: 1.01-1.31]; P = 0.04). Conclusions. 
Consideration should be given to avoid ADT in obese men with low- or 
favorable-intermediate risk PC where improved cancer control has not been 
observed, but shortened life expectancy from weight gain is expected.

We investigated the influence of lactic acid treatment of pheasant meat before 
vacuum-packaged storage of 3, 7, and 10 d at +6°C on microbiota and pH. Breast 
muscle samples were collected from carcasses of slaughtered as well as from 
hunted (shot) wild pheasants. Immersion of meat samples in 3% (wt/wt) lactic 
acid for 60 s effectuated a significant drop in pH of approximately 0.5 to 0.7 
units, which remained during the entire storage period. In parallel, total 
aerobic counts of such treated and stored samples were on an average 1.5 to 1.7 
log units lower than in non-acid-treated samples. Similar results were found for 
Enterobacteriaceae. A significant decrease in pH was measured at d 7 and 10 in 
the acid-treated samples in comparison with the untreated ones. In summary, the 
immersion of pheasant breast meat cuts in dilute lactic acid significantly 
reduced microbiota during vacuum-packed storage, even at slight temperature 
abuse conditions.

BACKGROUND: Microvascular and macrovascular abnormalities are frequently found 
on noninvasive tests performed in older adults. Their prognostic implications on 
disability and life expectancy have not been collectively assessed.
METHODS: This prospective study included 2,452 adults (mean age: 79.5 years) 
with available measures of microvascular (brain, retina, kidney) and 
macrovascular abnormalities (brain, carotid, coronary, peripheral artery) in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study. The burden of microvascular and macrovascular 
abnormalities was examined in relation to total, activity-of-daily-living 
disability-free, and severe disability-free life expectancies in the next 10 
years (1999-2009).
RESULTS: At 75 years, individuals with low burden of both abnormalities lived, 
on average, 8.71 years (95% confidence interval: 8.29, 9.12) of which 7.67 years 
(7.16, 8.17) were without disability. In comparison, individuals with high 
burden of both abnormalities had shortest total life expectancy (6.95 years 
[6.52, 7.37]; p < .001) and disability-free life expectancy (5.60 years [5.10, 
6.11]; p < .001). Although total life expectancy was similarly reduced for those 
with high burden of either type of abnormalities (microvascular: 7.96 years 
[7.50, 8.42] vs macrovascular: 8.25 years [7.80, 8.70]; p = .10), microvascular 
abnormalities seemed to have larger impact than macrovascular abnormalities on 
disability-free life expectancy (6.45 years [5.90, 6.99] vs 6.96 years [6.43, 
7.48]; p = .016). These results were consistent for severe disability-free life 
expectancy and in individuals without clinical cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering both microvascular and macrovascular abnormalities from 
multiple noninvasive tests may provide additional prognostic information on how 
older adults spend their remaining life. Optimal clinical use of this 
information remains to be determined.

Autophagy is a well-conserved catabolic process, involving the degradation of a 
cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery. Autophagy is 
typically induced by nutrient starvation and has a role in nutrient recycling, 
cellular differentiation, degradation and programmed cell death. Another common 
response in eukaryotes is the extension of lifespan through dietary restriction 
(DR). We studied a link between DR and autophagy in the filamentous fungus 
Podospora anserina, a multicellular model organism for ageing studies and 
mitochondrial deterioration. While both carbon and nitrogen restriction extends 
lifespan in P. anserina, the size of the effect varied with the amount and type 
of restricted nutrient. Natural genetic variation for the DR response exists. 
Whereas a switch to carbon restriction up to halfway through the lifetime 
resulted in extreme lifespan extension for wild-type P. anserina, all 
autophagy-deficient strains had a shorter time window in which ageing could be 
delayed by DR. Under nitrogen limitation, only PaAtg1 and PaAtg8 mediate the 
effect of lifespan extension; the other autophagy-deficient mutants PaPspA and 
PaUth1 had a similar response as wild-type. Our results thus show that the 
ageing process impinges on the DR response and that this at least in part 
involves the genetic regulation of autophagy.

[Life expectancy of patients with primary glaucoma, residents of a large 
industrial city of Siberia].

[Article in Russian]

Onishchenko AL, Kolbasko AV, Zhilina NM, Isakov IN, Vlasenko AE.

PURPOSE: To investigate life expectancy and the structure of causes of death in 
patients with primary glaucoma, residents of a large industrial city of Siberia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The database of the Novokuznetsk Public Health Department 
information analysis center on registration forms 025 (outpatients) and 066 
(inpatients) for 2004-2011 was analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 5424 primary glaucoma patients were registered during 
2004-2011, of whom 441 (8.1%) subsequently died. Age at death of patients with 
primary glaucoma was 69.0 +/- 7.2 years. The difference between age at death and 
at diagnosis of glaucoma was 2.6 +/- 1.8 years.
CONCLUSION: The correlation suggests that primary glaucoma is a predicting 
factor for vascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. The authors 
assume that topical administration of beta blockers without consulting a 
physician and/or a cardiologist may lead to ischemic stroke.

What's missing in missing data? Omissions in survey responses among parents of 
children with advanced cancer.

Rosenberg AR(1), Dussel V, Orellana L, Kang T, Geyer JR, Feudtner C, Wolfe J.

(1)1 Seattle Children's Hospital , Seattle, Washington.

BACKGROUND: Missing data is a common phenomenon with survey-based research; 
patterns of missing data may elucidate why participants decline to answer 
certain questions.
OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of missing data in the Pediatric Quality of Life 
and Evaluation of Symptoms Technology (PediQUEST) study, and highlight 
challenges in asking sensitive research questions.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, survey-based study embedded within a randomized 
controlled trial.
SETTING: Three large children's hospitals: Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer 
and Blood Disorders Center (DF/BCCDC); Children's Hospital of Philadelphia 
(CHOP); and Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH).
MEASUREMENTS: At the time of their child's enrollment, parents completed the 
Survey about Caring for Children with Cancer (SCCC), including demographics, 
perceptions of prognosis, treatment goals, quality of life, and psychological 
distress.
RESULTS: Eighty-six of 104 parents completed surveys (83% response). The 
proportion of missing data varied by question type. While 14 parents (16%) left 
demographic fields blank, over half (n=48; 56%) declined to answer at least one 
question about their child's prognosis, especially life expectancy. The presence 
of missing data was unrelated to the child's diagnosis, time from progression, 
time to death, or parent distress (p>0.3 for each). Written explanations in 
survey margins suggested that addressing a child's life expectancy is 
particularly challenging for parents.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parents of children with cancer commonly refrain from 
answering questions about their child's prognosis, however, they may be more 
likely to address general cure likelihood than explicit life expectancy. 
Understanding acceptability of sensitive questions in survey-based research will 
foster higher quality palliative care research.

We present a rare case of a child with a Wilm's tumor with an intravascular 
tumor-thrombus extending from the inferior vena cava to the right ventricle via 
the tricuspid valve. Rapid tumor progression resulted in life-threatening 
clinical deterioration. Radiologic and cardiac imaging demonstrated the extent 
of the intravascular extension of her tumor-thrombus. Emergency neo-adjuvant 
chemotherapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement, so that complete surgical 
excision was possible. Following multimodality therapy, the child is now in 
remission. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound 43:262-264, 2015.

Islet cell response to high fat programming in neonate, weanling and adolescent 
Wistar rats.

Cerf ME(1), Louw J.

Author information:
(1)South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa. 
marlon.cerf@mrc.ac.za.

CONTEXT: High fat programming, by exposure to a high saturated fat diet during 
fetal and/or lactational life induces metabolic derangements and alters islet 
cell architecture in neonate and weanling rats.
OBJECTIVE: The present study assessed metabolic changes and islet cell dynamics 
in response to high fat maintenance during specific developmental periods in 
adolescent rats, with some parameters also studied in neonate and weanling rats.
METHODS: The experimental groups comprised neonates, weanlings and adolescents 
maintained on a high fat diet during specific periods of fetal, lactational 
and/or postnatal life. Control neonates, weanlings and adolescents were 
maintained on a standard laboratory (control or low fat) diet. Fetal high fat 
programmed (i.e., maintained on a high fat diet exclusively during fetal life) 
neonates were insulin resistant.
RESULTS: Weanlings maintained on a high fat diet throughout fetal and 
lactational life had increased pancreas weights. Fetal high fat programmed 
adolescents presented a normal phenotype mimicking the control adolescents. 
Adolescents maintained on a postnatal high fat diet had increased body weights, 
hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and insulin resistance 
displaying beta cell hypertrophy and increased islet cell proliferation. 
Adolescents maintained on a fetal and postnatal high fat diet had increased body 
weights, hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: High fat programming induces various diabetogenic phenotypes which 
present at different life stages. The postnatal period from birth to adolescence 
represents an extension for high fat programming of metabolic disease.

New population and life expectancy estimates for the Indigenous population of 
Australia's Northern Territory, 1966-2011.

Wilson T(1).

Author information:
(1)Queensland Centre for Population Research, School of Geography, Planning and 
Environmental Management, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, 
Australia.

BACKGROUND: The Indigenous population of Australia suffers considerable 
disadvantage across a wide range of socio-economic indicators, and is therefore 
the focus of many policy initiatives attempting to 'close the gap' between 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Unfortunately, past population 
estimates have proved unreliable as denominators for these indicators. The aim 
of the paper is to contribute more robust estimates for the Northern Territory 
Indigenous population for the period 1966-2011, and hence estimate one of the 
most important of socio-economic indicators, life expectancy at birth.
METHOD: A consistent time series of population estimates from 1966 to 2011, 
based off the more reliable 2011 official population estimates, was created by a 
mix of reverse and forward cohort survival. Adjustments were made to ensure 
sensible sex ratios and consistency with recent birth registrations. Standard 
life table methods were employed to estimate life expectancy. Drawing on an 
approach from probabilistic forecasting, confidence intervals surrounding 
population numbers and life expectancies were estimated.
RESULTS: The Northern Territory Indigenous population in 1966 numbered between 
23,800 and 26,100, compared to between 66,100 and 73,200 in 2011. In 1966-71 
Indigenous life expectancy at birth lay between 49.1 and 56.9 years for males 
and between 49.7 and 57.9 years for females, whilst by 2006-11 it had increased 
to between 60.5 and 66.2 years for males and between 65.4 and 70.8 for females. 
Over the last 40 years the gap with all-Australian life expectancy has not 
narrowed, fluctuating at about 17 years for both males and females. Whilst 
considerable progress has been made in closing the gap in under-five mortality, 
at most other ages the mortality rate differential has increased.
CONCLUSIONS: A huge public health challenge remains. Efforts need to be 
redoubled to reduce the large gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous Australians.

Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of laryngeal examination after elective total 
thyroidectomy.

Lang BH(1), Wong CK, Tsang RK, Wong KP, Wong BY.

Author information:

Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China, blang@hku.hk.

BACKGROUND: Although routine laryngeal examination (RLE) after thyroidectomy may 
cost more than selective laryngeal examination (SLE), it permits earlier 
detection and treatment of vocal cord palsy (VCP) and so may be cost-saving in 
the longer term. We compared the 2-year cost-effectiveness between RLE and SLE 
with RLE performed at 2 weeks (SLE-2w), 1 month (SLE-1m), and 3 months (SLE-3m) 
after thyroidectomy in the institution's perspective.
METHODS: Our case definition was a hypothetical 50-year-old woman who underwent 
an elective total thyroidectomy for a benign multinodular goiter. A 
decision-analytic model was constructed to compare the estimated 
cost-effectiveness between RLE, SLE-2w, SLE-1m, and SLE-3m after a 2-year 
period. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated from the 
literature. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was set at 
US$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity and threshold analyses were 
used to examine model uncertainty.
RESULTS: RLE was not cost-effective because its incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio to SLE-2w, SLE-1m, and SLE-3m were US$302,755, US$227,883 and US$247,105, 
respectively. RLE was only cost-effective when the temporary VCP rate 
increased >42.7 % or when the cost of RLE equaled zero. Similarly, SLE-2w was 
only cost-effective to SLE-3m when dysphonia for temporary VCP at 3 months 
increased >39.13 %, dysphonia for permanent VCP at 3 months increased >50.29 %, 
or dysphonia without VCP at 3 months increased >42.69 %. However, none of these 
scenarios appeared clinically likely.
CONCLUSIONS: In the institution's perspective, RLE was not cost-effective 
against the other three SLE strategies. Regarding to the optimal timing of SLE, 
SLE-3m appears to be a reasonable and acceptable strategy because of its 
relative low overall cost.

BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations of nursing home residents with dementia may not be 
uncommon. However, evidence from epidemiological studies outside the United 
States and knowledge about the circumstances of hospitalizations are lacking.
AIM: To examine the proportion of nursing home residents with dementia 
hospitalized in the last month of life and factors associated with 
hospitalization.
DESIGN: The design is stratified cluster sampling survey. Nurses retrospectively 
registered demographic and dementia-related information about deceased residents 
with dementia. This included information about hospitalizations, persons 
involved in hospitalization decisions and type and content of information 
transferred when hospitalized.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents dying with dementia in Belgium 
(Flanders) in 2010.
RESULTS: In the final month of life, 19.5% of nursing home residents dying with 
dementia (N = 198) were hospitalized, including 4.6% admitted to an intensive 
care unit. For 12.2% of residents dying with dementia, a do-not-hospitalize 
advance directive was present, for 57.0%, a do-not-hospitalize general 
physician-order. Residents without a do-not-hospitalize general physician-order 
were more likely of being hospitalized (adjusted odds ratio: 3.4; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.3-8.7). None of the hospitalizations occurred at the request of the 
resident; 37% were at the request of relatives; curative or life-prolonging 
treatments were the most frequent reasons given. Information about the 
resident's nursing care or medical treatment was transferred in almost all 
hospitalizations, information about wishes and preferences for future care in 
19%.
CONCLUSION: Hospitalization in Belgian nursing home residents with dementia in 
the last month of life was common. Documentation of do-not-hospitalize 
physician-orders in the resident's medical files may prevent hospitalizations.

The predicted shortfall of primary care physicians and the millions of newly 
insured beginning in 2014 call for an increase in the number of advanced 
practice nurses (APRNs). Advanced practice nurses can significantly improve 
their clients' quality of life and increase their life expectancy through 
tobacco cessation education. The purpose of this study was to educate APRN 
students on smoking information and techniques to assist clients with quitting 
smoking in the primary care setting.

The edible mushroom Volvariella volvacea is an important crop in Southeast Asia 
and is predominantly harvested in the egg stage. One of the main factors that 
negatively affect its yield and value is the rapid transition from the egg to 
the elongation stage, which has a decreased commodity value and shelf life. To 
improve our understanding of the changes during stipe development and the 
transition from egg to elongation stage in particular, we analyzed gene 
transcription in stipe tissue of V. volvacea using 3'-tag based digital 
expression profiling. Stipe development turned out to be fairly complex with 
high numbers of expressed genes, and regulation of stage differences is mediated 
mainly by changes in expression levels of genes, rather than on/off modulation. 
Most explicit is the strong up-regulation of cell division from button to egg, 
and the very strong down-regulation hereof from egg to elongation, that 
continues in the maturation stage. Button and egg share cell division as means 
of growth, followed by a major developmental shift towards rapid stipe 
elongation based on cell extension as demonstrated by inactivation of cell 
division throughout elongation and maturation. Examination of regulatory genes 
up-regulated from egg to elongation identified three potential high upstream 
regulators for this switch. The new insights in stipe dynamics, together with a 
series of new target genes, will provide a sound base for further studies on the 
developmental mechanisms of mushroom stipes and the switch from egg to 
elongation in V. volvacea in particular.

Active surveillance and surgery in localized prostate cancer.

Korea - hsk823@chol.com.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer and 
also the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. Concerns about 
overdiagnosis and overtreatment of PCa have been growing, leading to more 
conservative approaches, especially in the treatment of low-risk disease. As PCa 
is a relatively slow-growing tumor, complications of unnecessary curative 
management in low-risk PCa can be prevented by active surveillance (AS). AS 
helps to improve quality of life after deferred treatment. Several AS criteria 
have been suggested for delayed treatment. Although upgrading and/or upstaging 
of cancer is a limitation of AS, many reports have shown low rates of 
cancer-specific mortality up to now. Radical prostatectomy (RP) has been 
considered as standard treatment for prostate cancer to provide good oncologic 
outcomes. The increasing use of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, 
including robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, has contributed to better 
functional outcomes. So far, long-term randomized studies have not conclusively 
proven the superiority of either AS or RP. Well-designed long-term randomized 
studies will be required to compare the benefits of AS and immediate RP. Here, 
we review recent reports on the current status of AS and RP, including delayed 
RP, and discuss their merits in the management of localized PCa.

A 73-year-old woman has been diagnosed with a mammographically detected grade 3, 
2.2-cm invasive ductal carcinoma that is sentinel lymph node negative, estrogen 
receptor positive (80%), progesterone receptor negative, and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 negative (0 by immunohistochemistry). A gene expression 
assay (Oncotype DX, Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) showed a recurrence score 
of 28. Except for well-controlled hypertension and some aches and pains in her 
hands and knees, she has no other major illnesses. Her medications include an 
antihypertensive, vitamin D, and calcium. She discontinued cigarette smoking 20 
years ago and has an occasional glass of wine. She describes her health as good, 
is fully functional, drives, has had no falls, and provides the majority of care 
for her sick husband. Her blood pressure is 146/88, her body mass index is 29.7, 
and her physical examination is normal. She is aware of the benefits and risks 
of adjuvant endocrine therapy and has been referred to discuss the role of 
chemotherapy.

AIM: Outcome of primary total arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the knee with 
valgus deformity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2007, 28 primary total knee replacements 
were performed for osteoarthritis of the knee with valgus deformity. 21 cases 
were women and 7 men with a mean age of 66.6 years (extremes 54-81). The 
clinical and radiological evaluations were done considering the knee range of 
motion, Knee Society Score (KSS) and femorotibial angle measured on the frontal 
standing long leg X-rays. Preoperatively, the knee valgus deformity angle was 6 
to 15 degrees in 14 cases, 15 to 25 degrees in 10 cases and over 25 degrees in 4 
cases.
RESULTS: After a mean follow-up time of 14 months (extremes 7-29), the knee 
range of motion improved from a mean of 71 degrees (extremes 52-87) 
preoperatively to a mean of 95 degrees (extremes 78-110) postoperatively. The 
KSS value improved from 21.3 points (extremes 1-33) preoperatively to 80.7 
points (extremes 70-92) postoperatively and the frontal femorotibial angle from 
a mean value of 21 degrees (extremes 11-39) of valgus before surgery, to a mean 
of 9 degrees (extremes 0-12) of valgus after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Long leg AP view X-ray examination in standing position is 
mandatory. The standard medial parapatellar approach is appropriate in this type 
of arthroplasty even if significant knee valgus deviations are present because 
it avoids the lateral approach complications. Postoperatively, one can get an 
aligned and stable knee if a judicious and progressive periarticular soft 
tissues balancing is achieved, in both flexion and extension position.

Surgery Department, "Sf. Pantelimon" Hospital, Bucharest.

INTRODUCTION: As liver cirrhosis has an increasing incidence in the general 
population and the life expectancy for these patients has increased, surgery 
procedures practiced for acute abdomen in such category of patients are more 
frequent.
AIM: To evaluate the predictive value of POSSUM score in cirrhotic patients 
undergoing abdominal surgery in emergency cases.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study based on 115 consecutive patients with 
liver cirrhosis hospitalized and operated in the first 24 hours from admission 
for acute abdomen. The patients' stratification was done by using Child Pugh 
score for liver cirrhosis. POSSUM score was calculated for each patient and 
postoperative outcomes were compared with prediction based on this score. 
Statistical data analysis was made by using the chi-square test and a p value of 
less than 0,05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: There were 33 patients in stage Child A of cirrhosis, 54 in stage Child 
B and 28 in stage Child C. For Child A group, the POSSUM score had a 
satisfactory prediction in terms of morbidity and mortality. In advanced stages 
of liver cirrhosis, Child B and C, mortality had high rate and the observed 
outcomes were outside the area of POSSUM score prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: POSSUM score offers a satisfactory prediction for morbidity and 
mortality in emergency abdominal surgery for patients in compensated stages of 
liver cirrhosis. In advanced stages of cirrhosis high levels of mortality cannot 
be predicted by using POSSUM score.

Economic evaluation of prostate cancer screening test as a national cancer 
screening program in South Korea.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is rapidly increasing in Korea and professional 
societies have requested adding prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing to the 
National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP), but this started a controversy in 
Korea and neutral evidence on this issue is required more than ever. The purpose 
of this study was to provide economic evidence to the decision makers of the 
NCSP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed on the adoption of 
PSA screening program among men aged 50-74-years in Korea from the healthcare 
system perspective. Several data sources were used for the cost-utility 
analysis, including general health screening data, the Korea Central Cancer 
Registry, national insurance claims data, and cause of mortality from the 
National Statistical Office. To solicit the utility index of prostate cancer, a 
face-to-face interview for typical men aged 40 to 69 was conducted using a 
Time-Trade Off method.
RESULTS: As a result, the increase of effectiveness was estimated to be very 
low, when adopting PSA screening, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was analyzed as about 94 million KRW. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
on the incidence rate, screening rate, cancer stage distribution, utility index, 
and treatment costs but the results were consistent with the base analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Under Korean circumstances with a relatively low incidence rate of 
prostate cancer, PSA screening is not cost-effective. Therefore, we conclude 
that adopting national prostate cancer screening would not be beneficial until 
further evidence is provided in the future.

BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia is a relatively common neurosurgical pathology 
with multiple management options. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is 
nonablative and is considered the gold standard. However, stereotaxic 
radiosurgery (SRS) and percutaneous stereotaxic rhizotomy (PSR) are 2 
noninvasive but ablative options that have rapidly gained support.
OBJECTIVE: To use Medicare claims data in conjunction with a literature review 
to assess the usage, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the 3 different 
invasive treatments for trigeminal neuralgia.
METHODS: All of the claims of trigeminal neuralgia treatment were extracted from 
the 2011 5% Inpatient and Outpatient Limited Data Set. Current Procedural 
Terminology, 4th Edition/International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision codes for the 3 different surgical treatment modalities were used to 
further classify these claims. Kaplan-Meier survival curves in key articles were 
used to calculate quality-adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness for each 
procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 1582 claims of trigeminal neuralgia were collected. 
Ninety-four (6%) patients underwent surgical intervention. Forty-eight (51.1%) 
surgical patients underwent MVD, 39 (41.5%) underwent SRS, and 7 (7.4%) 
underwent PSR. The average weighted costs for MVD, SRS, and PSR were $40 434.95, 
$38 062.27, and $3910.64, respectively. The quality-adjusted life years were 8.2 
for MVD, 4.9 for SRS, and 6.5 for PSR. The cost per quality-adjusted life year 
was calculated as $4931.1, $7767.8, and $601.64 for MVD, SRS, and PSR, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the most frequently used surgical management 
of trigeminal neuralgia is MVD, followed closely by SRS. PSR, despite being the 
most cost-effective, is by far the least utilized treatment modality.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the knowledge and beliefs of public policymakers on 
social inequalities in health and policies to reduce them in cities from 
different parts of Europe during 2010 and 2011.
DESIGN: Phenomenological qualitative study.
SETTING: 13 European cities.
PARTICIPANTS: 19 elected politicians and officers with a directive status from 
13 European cities.
MAIN OUTCOME: Policymaker's knowledge and beliefs.
RESULTS: Three emerging discourses were identified among the interviewees, 
depending on the city of the interviewee. Health inequalities were perceived by 
most policymakers as differences in life-expectancy between population with 
economic, social and geographical differences. Reducing health inequalities was 
a priority for the majority of cities which use surveys as sources of 
information to analyse these. Bureaucracy, funding and population beliefs were 
the main barriers.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the interviewed policymakers gave an account of 
interventions focusing on the immediate determinants and aimed at modifying 
lifestyles and behaviours in the more disadvantaged classes. More funding should 
be put towards academic research on effective universal policies, evaluation of 
their impact and training policymakers and officers on health inequalities in 
city governments.
