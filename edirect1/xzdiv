Publication of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) in 2003 established 
lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) as a viable treatment of select patients 
with moderate to severe emphysema, and the only intervention since the 
availability of ambulatory supplemental oxygen to improve survival. Despite 
these findings, surgical treatment has been underused in part because of concern 
for high morbidity and mortality. This article reviews recent literature 
generated since the original NETT publication, focusing on physiologic 
implications of LVRS, recent data regarding the safety and durability of LVRS, 
and patient selection and extension of NETT criteria to other patient 
populations.

Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) patient selection guidelines are based on 
the National Emphysema Treatment Trial. Because of increased mortality and poor 
improvement in functional outcomes, patients with non-upper lobe emphysema and 
low baseline exercise capacity are determined as poor candidates for LVRS. In 
well-selected patients with heterogeneous emphysema, LVRS has a durable 
long-term outcome at up to 5-years of follow-up. Five-year survival rates in 
patients range between 63% and 78%. LVRS seems a durable alternative for 
end-stage heterogeneous emphysema in patients not eligible for lung 
transplantation. Future studies will help identify eligible patients with 
homogeneous emphysema for LVRS.

Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders are becoming more 
prevalent as advances in technology and medicine increase living standards and 
life expectancy. Alzheimer's disease is thought to initiate development early in 
the patient's life and progresses continuously into old age. This process is 
characterized molecularly by the amyloid hypothesis, which asserts that 
self-aggregating amyloid peptides are core to the pathophysiology in Alzheimer's 
progression. Precise quantification of amyloid peptides in human bodily fluid 
samples (i.e. cerebrospinal fluid, blood) may inform diagnosis and prognosis, 
and has been studied using established biosensing technologies like liquid 
chromatography, mass spectrometry, and immunoassays. However, existing methods 
are challenged to provide single molecule, quantitative analysis of the 
disease-causing aggregation process. Ultra-sensitive nanopore biosensors can 
step in to fill this role as a dynamic mapping tool. The work in this paper 
establishes characteristic signals of β-amyloid 40 monomers, oligomers, and 
soluble aggregates, as well as a proof-of-concept foundation where a biological 
nanopore biosensor is used to monitor the extent of in vitro β-amyloid 40 
peptide aggregation at the single molecule level. This foundation allows for 
future work to expand in drug screening, diagnostics, and aggregation dynamic 
experiments.

The aim of this multicenter trial was to compare the effects of whole-body 
electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) and whole-body vibration (WBV) with conventional 
back-strengthening training (CT) on changes in mean back pain intensity (MPI) 
and trunk strength in patients suffering from chronic non-specific low back pain 
(CNLBP). Two-hundred and forty CNLBP patients (40-70 years; 62% female) were 
randomly assigned to three intervention arms (WB-EMS: n = 80 vs. WBV: n = 80 vs. 
CT: n = 80). All training intervention programs were performed for 12 weeks in 
their usual commercial training setting. Before and during the last 4 weeks of 
the intervention, MPI was recorded using a 4-week pain diary. Additionally, 
maximal isometric trunk extension and -flexion strength was assessed on the 
BackCheck® machine. A moderate but significant decrease of MPI was observed in 
all groups (WB-EMS: 29.7 ± 39.1% (SMD 0.50) vs. WBV: 30.3 ± 39.3% (SMD 0.57) vs. 
CT: 30.5 ± 39.6% (SMD 0.59); p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed for 
maximal isometric strength parameters with a significant increase in all groups 
(extension: WB-EMS: 17.1 ± 25.5% vs. WBV: 16.2 ± 23.6% vs. CT: 21.6 ± 27.5%; p < 
0.001; flexion: WB-EMS: 13.3 ± 25.6% vs. WBV: 13.9 ± 24.0% vs. CT: 13.9 ± 25.4%; 
p < 0.001). No significant interaction effects for MPI (p = 0.920) and strength 
parameters (extension: p = 0.436; flexion: p = 0.937) were observed. WB-EMS, 
WBV, and CT are comparably effective in improving MPI and trunk strength. 
However, training volume of WB-EMS was 43 or 62% lower, compared with CT and 
WBV.

Differentiate Between Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Who Require 
Intensive Care.

of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

OBJECTIVES: To determine how several existing crisis standards of care triage 
protocols would have distinguished between patients with coronavirus disease 
2019 requiring intensive care.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Single urban academic medical center.
PATIENTS: One-hundred twenty patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required 
intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The characteristics of each patient at the time 
of ICU triage were used to determine how patients would have been prioritized 
using four crisis standards of care protocols. The vast majority of patients in 
the cohort would have been in the highest priority group using a triage protocol 
focusing on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment alone. Prioritization based on 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 1-year life expectancy would have 
resulted in only slightly more differentiation between patients. Prioritization 
based on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and 5-year life expectancy would 
have added significant additional differentiation depending on how priority 
groups were defined.
CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable controversy regarding the use of criteria 
other than prognosis for short-term survival in initial allocation of critical 
care resources under crisis standards of care triage protocols. To the extent 
that initial triage protocols would not create sufficient differentiation 
between patients, effectively resulting in a first-come, first-served initial 
allocation of resources, it is important to focus on how resources would be 
reallocated in the event of ongoing scarcity.

Demographic changes in the Western world linked to the increase in the elderly 
population, life expectancy and above all cancer patients and chronically ill 
patients, often entrusted to home care or in healthcare residences, highlight an 
exponential increase in requests for diagnostic tests at home. Conventional 
radiographic examinations, such as thoracic, musculoskeletal and abdominal 
images are the most requested and are important first level diagnostic tests. To 
date and, in particular, in times of COVID-19 emergency, these patients need to 
be transferred to the hospital to perform radiological examinations which 
involve an increase in costs for the health system and an increased risk for the 
health of these patients, already often debilitated and immunocompromised. This 
article discussed the benefits of taking conventional chest x-rays directly at 
the patient's home.

Enabling Guidelines for the Adoption of eHealth Solutions: Scoping Review.

Støme LN(1), Wilhelmsen CR(1), Kværner KJ(1).

(1)Centre for Connected Care, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

BACKGROUND: Globally, public health care is under increasing pressure, an 
economic burden currently amplified by the COVID-19 outbreak. With the 
recognition that universal health coverage improves the health of a population 
and reduces health inequalities, universal health coverage has been acknowledged 
as a priority goal. To meet the global needs in a population with increased 
chronic illness and longer life expectancy, the health care system is in dire 
need of new, emerging technologies. eHealth solutions as a method of delivery 
may have an impact on quality of care and health care costs. As such, it is 
important to study methods previously used to avoid suboptimal implementation 
and promote general guidelines to further develop eHealth solutions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore and thematically categorize a selected 
representation of early phase studies on eHealth technologies, focusing on 
papers that are under development or undergoing testing. Further, we want to 
assess enablers and barriers in terms of usability, scaling, and data management 
of eHealth implementation. The aim of this study to explore early development 
phase and feasibility studies was an intentional effort to provide applicable 
guidelines for evaluation at different stages of implementation.
METHODS: A structured search was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane to 
identify and provide insight in current eHealth technology and methodology under 
development and gain insight in the future potential of eHealth technologies.
RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included in this review. The clinical 
studies were categorized thematically by illness comparing 4 technology types 
deemed relevant: apps/web-based technology, sensor technology, virtual reality, 
and television. All eHealth assessment and implementation studies were 
categorized by their focus point: usability, scaling, or data management. 
Studies assessing the effect of eHealth were divided into feasibility studies, 
qualitative studies, and heuristic assessments. Studies focusing on usability 
(16/27) mainly addressed user involvement and learning curve in the adoption of 
eHealth, while the majority of scaling studies (6/27) focused on strategic and 
organizational aspects of upscaling eHealth solutions. Studies focusing on data 
management (5/27) addressed data processing and data sensitivity in adoption and 
diffusion of eHealth. Efficient processing of data in a secure manner, as well 
as user involvement and feedback, both throughout small studies and during 
upscaling, were the important enablers considered for successful implementation 
of eHealth.
CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions have considerable potential to improve 
lifestyle changes and adherence to treatment recommendations. To promote 
efficient implementation and scaling, user involvement to promote 
user-friendliness, secure and adaptable data management, and strategical 
considerations needs to be addressed early in the development process. eHealth 
should be assessed during its development into health services. The wide 
variation in interventions and methodology makes comparison of the results 
challenging and calls for standardization of methods.

OBJECTIVE: To correlate atherosclerosis (Ath) and osteoarthritis (OA) in mummies 
from ancient Egypt.
MATERIALS: Whole-body CT examinations of 23 mummies from the Ägyptisches Museum 
und Papyrussammlung, Berlin, Germany, and 22 mummies from the Museo Egizio, 
Turin, Italy.
METHODS: Ath was assessed in five anatomical regions by means of preserved 
arterial calcifications. OA was assessed using the Kellgren and Lawrence (1957) 
classification.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed no correlation between Ath and total OA. 
A significant association was found for Ath and the upper limb group for OA 
grade >1 and for Ath and the lower limb group, consisting mainly of the hip and 
knee, for OA grade >2 OA.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of Ath and advanced OA of the hip and knee is 
comparable in prevalence to those reported in recent clinical studies, despite 
the low life expectancy and the different environment and lifestyle of the 
ancient Egyptians.
SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to correlate findings of Ath and OA in 
ancient Egypt statistically. The diseases of Ath and OA are common ailments with 
enormous and increasing impacts on public health.
LIMITATIONS: The large number of cardiovascular diseases was indicated only by 
arterial calcifications that resisted the post-mortem changes of the 
mummification process. Also, the assessed OA was on radiological OA.
SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Genomic studies of ancient Egyptian mummies 
may reveal genetic risk factors for Ath and OA that could be shared in ancient 
and modern populations.

We investigated whether adaptations of quadriceps muscle activity to fatiguing 
exercise differs between sexes. Fifteen healthy men (age, mean ± SD; 
22. ± 2.4 yr, body mass 70.5 ± 11.4 kg, height 1.72 ± 0.06 m) and 15 healthy 
women (age, mean ± SD; 21 ± 1.8 yr, body mass 60 ± 7.5 kg, height 
1.62 ± 0.07 m), all right leg dominant, participated in the study. Participants 
performed a submaximal isometric knee extension contraction at 50% of the 
maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) sustained until task failure before and 
after a fatiguing exercise. Surface electromyography (EMG) was simultaneously 
recorded from nine regions distributed over the medial, middle and lateral 
locations of the quadriceps muscles in a longitudinal direction corresponding to 
the vastus medialis, rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis muscle, 
respectively. A significant reduction in maximal force and time to task failure 
were observed after fatiguing exercise for both sexes (P < 0.001). However, 
women displayed greater myoelectric manifestations of fatigue specifically for 
the RF during the post-fatigue sustained contraction (P < 0.05). The RF is more 
susceptible to fatiguing exercise in women compared to men which may partly 
explain the higher risk of knee injuries among female athletes during 
competitive sports.

MALIGNANT DISEASE: 1: ESGE recommends placement of partially or fully covered 
self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) for palliation of malignant dysphagia over 
laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, and esophageal bypass.Strong 
recommendation, high quality evidence. 2 : ESGE recommends brachytherapy as a 
valid alternative, alone or in addition to stenting, in esophageal cancer 
patients with malignant dysphagia and expected longer life expectancy.Strong 
recommendation, high quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends esophageal SEMS 
placement for sealing malignant tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal fistulas. 
Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 4 : ESGE does not recommend SEMS 
placement as a bridge to surgery or before preoperative chemoradiotherapy 
because it is associated with a high incidence of adverse events. Other options 
such as feeding tube placement are preferable. Strong recommendation, low 
quality evidence.
BENIGN DISEASE: 5: ESGE recommends against the use of SEMSs as first-line 
therapy for the management of benign esophageal strictures because of the 
potential for adverse events, the availability of alternative therapies, and 
their cost. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 6: ESGE suggests 
consideration of temporary placement of self-expandable stents for refractory 
benign esophageal strictures. Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 7: 
ESGE suggests that fully covered SEMSs be preferred over partially covered SEMSs 
for the treatment of refractory benign esophageal strictures because of their 
very low risk of embedment and ease of removability. Weak recommendation, low 
quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends the stent-in-stent technique to remove 
partially covered SEMSs that are embedded in the esophageal wall. Strong 
recommendation, low quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends that temporary stent 
placement can be considered for the treatment of leaks, fistulas, and 
perforations. No specific type of stent can be recommended, and the duration of 
stenting should be individualized. Strong recommendation, low quality of 
evidence. 10 : ESGE recommends considering placement of a fully covered 
large-diameter SEMS for the treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding refractory 
to medical, endoscopic, and/or radiological therapy, or as initial therapy for 
patients with massive bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality 
evidence.

Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is a 
major obstacle to increased life expectancy. However, survival has not improved 
significantly with average cancer standard treatment strategies over the past 
few decades; survival rates have remained low, with tumor metastasis, adverse 
drug reactions, and drug resistance. Therefore, substitute therapies are 
essential to treat this dreadful disease. Recently, research has shown that 
natural compounds in plants, such as phytochemicals, are extensively exploited 
for their anticarcinogenic potential. Phytochemicals may show their anticancer 
activity different cancer cell markers may alter molecular pathways, which 
promote in cellular events such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, regulate 
antioxidant status, cell proliferation, migration, invasion and toxicity. 
Although their outstanding anticancer activity, however, their pharmacological 
budding is hindered by their low aqueous solubility, poor bioavailability, and 
poor penetration into cells, hepatic disposition, narrow therapeutic index, and 
rapid uptake by normal tissues. In this situation, nanotechnology has developed 
novel inventions to increase the potential use of phytochemicals in anticancer 
therapy. Nanoparticles can improve the solubility and stability of 
phytochemicals, specific tumor cell/tissue targeting, enhanced cellular uptake, 
reduction of phytochemicals. Therapeutic doses of phytochemicals for a long 
time. Additional benefits include better blood stability, multifunctional design 
of nanocarriers and improvement in countermeasures. This review summarizes the 
advances in the use of nanoparticles for the treatment of cancer, as well as 
various nano-drug deliveries of phytochemicals against cancer. In particular, we 
are introducing several applications of nanoparticles in combination with 
phyto-drug for the treatment of cancer.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex disease that affects not only sensory and 
motor pathways below the neurological level of injury (NLI) but also all the 
organs and systems situated below this NLI. This multisystem impairment implies 
comprehensive management in dedicated SCI specialized centers, by 
interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary teams, able to treat not only the 
neurological impairment, but also all the systems and organs affected. After a 
brief history of the Spinal Cord Medicine, the author describes how to determine 
the level and severity of a SCI based on the International Standards for 
Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury and the prognosis factors of 
recovery. This article provides also a review of the numerous SCI-related 
impairments (except for urinary, sexual problems and pain treated separately in 
this issue), their principles of management and related complications.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that affects the 
skin, musculoskeletal structures and other organs and systems compromising 
functionality, quality of life and reducing the life expectancy of patients. It 
is a complex disease that requires specialist and timely care and management. 
The alternatives for treating the manifestations of psoriatic arthritis have 
increased and the effect of the different agents on specific manifestations has 
been clarified in recent studies. Therefore, we should incorporate the available 
evidence to build a strategy for the treatment of these patients. The Mexican 
College of Rheumatology selected a committee to evaluate these different 
alternatives and make recommendations.
METHODS: The study group included 16 rheumatologists and 3 certified 
dermatologists, selected from different health institutions and regions of the 
country. An executive committee was formed to coordinate the meetings and a 
committee of experts selected the literature search criteria, prepared the 
research questions, rated the quality of the evidence, and produced the 
recommendations in the different disease domains based on the GRADE methodology.
RESULTS: 24 updated recommendations were generated for the treatment of patients 
with psoriatic arthritis. The recommendations establish the role of the drugs 
currently available in our country. The importance of adequate disease control 
is emphasized, individualizing the level of involvement of each patient in each 
of the six domains potentially affected by the disease. In addition, the 
sequence in the choice of treatments available for each domain is established, 
based on their efficacy, safety profile and accessibility.
CONCLUSIONS: With this consensus document, it will be possible to improve the 
care of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The recommendations were generated 
based on the best available information and in consideration of the Mexican 
health system.

BiTE ® (bispecific T-cell engager) molecules exert antitumor activity by binding 
one arm to CD3 on cytotoxic T-cells and the other arm to a tumor-associated 
antigen. We generated a fully mouse cross-reactive mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted 
BiTE molecule that is genetically fused to a Fc-domain for half-life extension, 
and evaluated biodistribution and tumor targeting of a zirconium-89 
(89Zr)-labeled MSLN HLE BiTE molecule in 4T1 breast cancer bearing syngeneic 
mice with positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution of 50 µg 89Zr-MLSN 
HLE BiTE was studied over time by PET imaging in BALB/c mice and revealed uptake 
in tumor and lymphoid tissues with an elimination half-life of 63.4 hours. 
Compared to a non-targeting 89Zr-control HLE BiTE, the 89Zr-MLSN HLE BiTE showed 
a 2-fold higher tumor uptake and higher uptake in lymphoid tissues. Uptake in 
the tumor colocalized with mesothelin expression, while uptake in the spleen 
colocalized with CD3 expression. Evaluation of the effect of protein doses on 
the biodistribution and tumor targeting of 89Zr-MSLN HLE BiTE revealed for all 
dose groups that uptake in the spleen was faster than in the tumor (day 1 vs day 
5). The lowest dose of 10 µg 89Zr-MSLN HLE BiTE had higher spleen uptake and 
faster blood clearance compared to higher doses of 50 µg and 200 µg. 89Zr-MSLN 
HLE BiTE tumor uptake was similar at all doses. Conclusion: The MSLN HLE BiTE 
showed specific tumor uptake and both arms contributed to the biodistribution 
profile. These findings support the potential for clinical translation of HLE 
BiTE molecules.

Hübner J.

The chances of therapeutic success are a recognized criterion in allocating 
scarce medical resources. The approach aims to maximize the number of individual 
lives saved. There is good reason also to consider the number of life years 
saved in each case.

[Remaining life expectancy as a criterion of triage? - Contra].

[Article in German]

Rehmann-Sutter C.

A common intuition says the death of a younger person is more tragic, since 
older people could already live through more "innings" of their life. The most 
important reason against using age as a criterion in triage is however the 
infinite value of the other: In a relationship of responsibility and care, which 
is the functional base of medicine also in situations of emergency, the life of 
each other has infinite value, and therefore cannot be weighed against each 
other.

College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu, P. R. China.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is a common cancer in China. This project 
investigated the disease burden of gastric cancer from 1990 to 2019 in China and 
globally.
METHODS: The global age-standardized rates (ASRs) were extracted from the Global 
Burden of Disease. Moreover, the estimated annual percentage changes (eAPCs) in 
the ASRs of incidence (ASIR), mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) were calculated to determine the trends by countries and 
regions.
RESULTS: In China, the ASIR declined from 37.56 to 30.64 per 100,000 and the 
ASMR declined from 37.73 to 21.72 per 100,000. The global ASIR decreased from 
22.44 to 15.59 and the ASMR declined from 20.48 to 11.88 per 100,000 persons 
from 1990 to 2019. The ASIR was the lowest in Malawi (3.28 per 100,000) and the 
highest in Mongolia (43.7 per 100,000), whereas the ASMR was the lowest in the 
United States of America (3.40 per 100,000) and the highest in Mongolia (40.04 
per 100,000) in 2019. The incidence of early-onset gastric cancer increased in 
China. The DALYs attributed to gastric cancer presented a slight decrease during 
the period. China had a higher mortality/incidence ratio (0.845) and 5-year 
prevalence (27.6/100,000) than most developed countries.
CONCLUSION: China presented a steady decline in the incidence and mortality 
rates for gastric cancer. The global ASIR, ASMR, and DALYs showed a slight rise 
decrease. Different patterns of gastric cancer rates and temporal trends have 
been identified in different geographical regions, indicating that specific 
strategies are needed to prevent the increase in some countries.

BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that high occupational physical activity increases 
mortality risk. However, it is unclear whether this association is causal or can 
be explained by a complex network of socioeconomic and behavioural factors. We 
aimed to examine the association between occupational physical activity and 
longevity, taking a complex network of confounding variables into account.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we linked data from Norwegian 
population-based health examination surveys, covering all parts of Norway with 
data from the National Population and Housing Censuses and the Norwegian Cause 
of Death Registry. 437 378 participants (aged 18-65 years; 48·7% men) 
self-reported occupational physical activity (mutually exclusive groups: 
sedentary, walking, walking and lifting, and heavy labour) and were followed up 
from study entry (between February, 1974, and November, 2002) to death or end of 
follow-up on Dec 31, 2018, whichever came first. We estimated differences in 
survival time (death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) 
between occupational physical activity categories using flexible parametric 
survival models adjusted for confounding factors.
FINDINGS: During a median of 28 years (IQR 25-31) from study entry to the end of 
follow-up, 74 203 (17·0%) of the participants died (all-cause mortality), of 
which 20 111 (27·1%) of the deaths were due to cardiovascular disease and 29 886 
(40·3%) were due to cancer. Crude modelling indicated shorter mean survival 
times among men in physically active occupations than in those with sedentary 
occupations. However, this finding was reversed following adjustment for 
confounding factors (birth cohort, education, income, ethnicity, prevalent 
cardiovascular disease, smoking, leisure-time physical activity, body-mass 
index), with estimates suggesting that men in occupations characterised by 
walking, walking and lifting, and heavy labour had life expectancies equivalent 
to 0·4 (95% CI -0·1 to 1·0), 0·8 (0·3 to 1·3), and 1·7 (1·2 to 2·3) years 
longer, respectively, than men in the sedentary referent category. Results for 
mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer showed a similar pattern. No 
clear differences in survival times were observed between occupational physical 
activity groups in women.
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that moderate to high occupational physical 
activity contributes to longevity in men. However, occupational physical 
activity does not seem to affect longevity in women. These results might inform 
future physical activity guidelines for public health.

AIM: To quantify the relation between apparent treatment resistant hypertension 
(aTRH) and the risk of recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE 
including stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death) and mortality in 
patients with stable vascular disease.
METHODS: 7455 hypertensive patients with symptomatic vascular disease were 
included from the ongoing UCC-SMART cohort between 1996 and 2019. aTRH was 
defined as an office blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg despite treatment with ≥3 
antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. Cox proportional hazard models were 
used to quantify the relation between aTRH and the risk of recurrent MACE and 
all-cause mortality. In addition, survival for patients with aTRH was assessed, 
taking competing risk of non-vascular mortality into account.
RESULTS: A total of 1557 MACE and 1882 deaths occurred during a median follow-up 
of 9.0 years (interquartile range 4.8-13.1 years). Compared to patients with 
non-aTRH, the 614 patients (8%) with aTRH were at increased risk of 
cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.03-1.56) and death from any cause 
(HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.07-1.45) but not recurrent MACE (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.95-1.34). 
At the age of 50 years, patients with aTRH after a first cardiovascular event on 
average had a 6.4 year shorter median life expectancy free of recurrent MACE 
than patients with non-aTRH.
CONCLUSION: In hypertensive patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, 
aTRH is related to a higher risk of vascular death and death from any cause. 
Moreover, patients with aTRH after a first cardiovascular event have a 6.4 year 
shorter median life expectancy free of recurrent cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Increasingly, cancer drugs are being approved based on surrogate 
measurements of efficacy. Clinically meaningful data, such as overall survival 
(OS) and quality of life, are often only presented in subsequent publications. 
We examined if the clinical benefit of cancer drugs, as measured by the European 
Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS), 
improves post-European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval as more data emerges.
METHODS: Cancer drug indications approved by the EMA from January 2006 to 
December 2016 were reviewed and trials cited for efficacy were identified. 
Primary and subsequent publications (up to December 2019) of scorable trials 
were included. Changes in benefit over time were measured using ESMO-MCBS 
thresholds for non-curative (≥4 for substantial, =3 for intermediate and ≤2 for 
low benefit) and curative intent (A or B for major benefit) scoring.
RESULTS: Fifty-five non-curative and two curative intent trials were included. 
At approval, 29.1% of non-curative trials were substantial, 45.5% intermediate 
and 25.5% low benefit. For curative intent trials, one displayed major benefit 
and one displayed no major benefit. We identified 82 subsequent publications for 
reassessment. A change in ESMO-MCBS classification was seen in 34.5% of 
non-curative trials (11 raised and 8 lowered). At 3-year reassessment, 36.4% of 
non-curative trials were substantial, 34.5% intermediate and 29.1% low benefit. 
Both curative trials showed no major benefit at reassessment.
CONCLUSION: As over a third of trials changed classification, in either 
direction, reassessing the ESMO-MCBS score of approved cancer drugs may help to 
inform patients and ensure ongoing relevance of regulatory and reimbursement 
decisions.
