and double-level L4-5 Fusion + L5-S1 Fusion model. The pure moment was applied 
to the specimen model to simulate physiological activities in daily life through 
a custom-built robot testing device with an optical tracking system. Results: 
For single-level lumbar fusion, compared to the traditional Fusion fixation, the 
Coflex dynamic fixation mainly restricted the extension of L4-L5, partially 
retained the range of motion (ROM) of the L4-L5 segment, and reduced the motion 
compensation of the upper adjacent segment. For the double-level lumbar 
fixation, the ROM of adjacent segments in the Coflex + Fusion was significantly 
decreased compared to the Fusion + Fusion fixation, but there was no significant 
difference. In addition, PT was the only sagittal parameter of the preoperative 
lumbar associated with the ROM under extension loading. The Coflex fixation had 
little effect on the original sagittal alignment of the lumbar spine. 
Conclusion: The Coflex was an effective lumbar surgical technique with a less 
altering kinematic motion of the lumbar both at the index segment and adjacent 
segments. However, when the Coflex was combined with the fusion fixation, this 
ability to protect adjacent segments remained elusive in slowing the accelerated 
degradation of adjacent segments.

BACKGROUND: The Harris-Galante (HG) prosthesis is a first-generation, cementless 
total hip arthroplasty (THA) prosthesis. Considering the recent increase in the 
demand for THA in young patients and their life expectancy, a study with a 
follow-up duration of longer than 20 years in a young population is needed. 
Therefore, we evaluated the long-term clinical and radiographic results after 
cementless THA using the HG prosthesis in patients younger than 50 years.
METHODS: A total of 61 THAs performed using the HG with a minimum follow-up of 
10 years were included. There were 38 men and 11 women with an average age of 46 
years and the mean follow-up duration was 22 years. Clinical evaluation included 
modified Harris Hip Score (HHS) and radiographic analysis consisted of cup 
inclination, anteversion angle, component stability, osteolysis, liner wear 
rate, wear-through, liner dissociation, and heterotopic ossification. 
Complications included recurrent dislocation, periprosthetic femoral fracture, 
and periprosthetic joint infection. Survivorship analysis included cup and stem 
revision for aseptic loosening, as well as any revision.
RESULTS: The HHS improved from 46.5 preoperatively to 81.8 postoperatively (p < 
0.001). The average linear wear rate was 0.36 mm/yr. A total of 34 hips (56%) 
were revised: stem revision in 10 (16.4%), cup revision in 9 (14.8%), exchange 
limited to bearing surface in 8 (13.1%), and revision of all components in 7 
(11.5%). Estimated survivorship at 34 years postoperatively was 90.9% for cup 
revision for aseptic loosening, 80.5% for stem revision for aseptic loosening, 
and 22.1% for any revision.
CONCLUSIONS: THA using the HG prosthesis showed satisfactory estimated 
survivorship of the acetabular and femoral components at 34 years 
postoperatively with good clinical outcomes. Bearing-related problems, such as 
osteolysis and liner dissociation, accounted for 56% of revision operations and 
were concerns in patients younger than 50 years.

BACKGROUND: Sacubitril-valsartan was recommended for heart failure (HF) and 
proven cost-effective in HF. Recently, sacubitril-valsartan has been recommended 
to treat hypertension by the Chinese expert consensus. The cost utility of 
sacubitril-valsartan for hypertension remains uninvestigated.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to 
investigate the real efficacy of sacubitril-valsartan on blood pressure, 
compared with angiotensin receptor blockers or placebo. A lifetime Markov model 
was developed to compare the cost utility of sacubitril-valsartan vs. valsartan. 
The primary outcome was the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), representing 
the ratio of incremental costs to the incremental utility. The 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was three times of per capita gross domestic 
product (GDP) in China in 2021. Sacubitril-valsartan was considered 
cost-effective if the ICUR obtained was lower than the WTP threshold, otherwise, 
sacubitril-valsartanis was not cost-effective.
RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs of 5,781 patients were included in the 
meta-analysis. For comparison of sacubitril-valsartan 400 mg/day vs. valsartan 
320 mg/day, a reduction in blood pressure (BP) of -5.97 (-6.38, -5.56) (p < 
0.01) was observed. Cost-utility analysis showed that for a 60-year-old patient 
with hypertension, if sacubitril-valsartan was prescribed as the 
antihypertensive agent, he had a life expectancy of 11.91 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) with costs of 65,066 CNY, and if valsartan was prescribed as 
the antihypertensive agent, the life expectancy would be 11.82 QALY with costs 
of 54,769 CNY; thus, an ICUR of 108,622 CNY/QALY was obtained, lower than the 
WTP threshold.
CONCLUSION: Compared with valsartan, sacubitril-valsartan is more effective in 
reducing blood pressure and may result in more quality-adjusted life-year, 
although with higher costs. Sacubitril-valsartan is cost-effective for 
hypertension in the current China setting under the willingness-to-pay threshold 
of 3 times of per capita GDP.

OBJECTIVE: To summarise and compare the key recommendations on prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer, and so highlight where more 
evidence is required to facilitate consistent recommendations.
METHODS: The Medline database and websites of 18 national screening 
organisations and professional associations were searched between January 2010 
and November 2020 to identify screening guidelines published in English, 
considering recent clinical trials.
RESULTS: Population-based PSA testing of asymptomatic men is not widely 
recommended. Guidelines emphasize shared patient-clinician decision making. For 
'average-risk' men choosing to be screened, the recommended age varies from 
50-55 to 70 years, alongside consideration of life expectancy (ranging from 7-15 
years). Screening intervals, when specified, are biennial (most common), annual, 
or determined from baseline PSA. The earliest age for screening high-risk men 
(frequently defined as of African descent or with a family history of prostate 
cancer) is 40 years, but recommendations often defer to clinical judgement.
CONCLUSIONS: Population screening of asymptomatic men is not widely recommended. 
Instead, balancing the potential harms and benefits of PSA testing is endorsed. 
Variation between guidelines stems from differing interpretations of key trials 
and could lead to clinician-dependent screening views. The development of 
clinical decision aids and international consensus on guidelines may help reduce 
national and international variation on how men are counselled.

After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), there are differences in 
the neuromuscular deficits observed in patients with bone-patellar tendon-bone 
(BPTB) and with hamstring tendon (HT) autografts. The differences in knee 
extensor and flexor strength are commonly reported, but analyses have largely 
focused on peak torque metrics despite the requirement to generate torque 
through range when returning to sport. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the angle-specific strength and strength asymmetry differences between BPTB and 
HT around the time of return to play after ACLR. A total of 357 male field sport 
athletes with either a BPTB (n = 297) or an HT (n = 60) autograft underwent 
concentric knee flexor and extensor isokinetic strength testing 9 months 
post-ACLR. Angle-specific torques were compared between grafts and limbs using 
1D Statistical Parametric Mapping and discrete-point variables. Inter-limb 
extensor torque asymmetry was greater in BTPB than HT at knee angles of >30° 
(p = 0.001, peak d = 5.53), with flexor torque asymmetry lower in BPTB than HT 
at flexion angles of >25° (p = 0.001, peak d = 2.68). Angle of maximum asymmetry 
and angle of operated limb peak torque differed in knee extension for BPTB 
(p < 0.001, d = 0.32) but not HT, whereas knee flexion angle of maximum 
asymmetry and operated limb peak torque differed in both BTPB (p < 0.001, 
d = 0.75) and HT (p < 0.001, d = 0.43). Graft type affected extensor torque at 
knee angles of 67°-85° and flexor torque at knee angles of 27°-85°. 
Angle-specific strength analysis may inform the rehabilitation process and 
improve rehabilitation and return-to-play decision making strategies in 
comparison with the use of peak torque values alone.

α-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) is a serine proteinase inhibitor that controls the 
activity of proteases like chymotrypsin, cathepsin G and mast cell chymase. 
Familial variants of ACT results in liver and lung diseases, but it is also 
reported to be associated with several other disease conditions. ACT is mainly 
synthesized in the liver using four coding exons, namely E1, E2, E3 and E4 
encoding a 423 amino acid protein that also includes a 23 amino acid signal 
peptide. It is found to be associated with amyloid plaques and is elevated 
during inflammatory response and modulates cytokine based signal transduction 
pathways, independent of its anti-protease activity. Therefore, the 
multispecificity of ACT and its non-inhibitory roles in diseased conditions 
warrants an assessment of possible existence of the other isoforms. 
Consequently, scanning of introns, 5' and 3' region of the ACT gene using 
computational tools like FGENESH and FEX did indicate the presence of coding 
regions. Using a combined approach of bioinformatics and molecular biology, we 
have found one novel exon located in the intronic region between exons E1 and 
E2, that splices with exon E2 and replaces N-terminal exon E1, generating an ACT 
isoform with a novel 151 base pair N-terminus. This isoform was found to lack 
the signal sequence and is smaller in size but its reactive centre loop remains 
intact. A truncated transcript was also confirmed with an extension of the E3 by 
a 12 nucleotide intronic region including a stop codon. Modelling studies show 
that due to removal of E4 this isoform lacks the RCL. Novel isoform ACT-N lacks 
E1 but has a conserved RCL. However, due to loss of strands of β-sheet A, it may 
also be inactive, but with ability to bind the target proteases. The novel 
truncated ACT-T isoform lacks the RCL and may have a non-inhibitory role. These 
hypothesis will need further work for functional validation.

The isotropic and anisotropic component Raman spectra and H NMR of 
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP)/carbon tetrachloride and NMP/methanol binary mixture 
at different volume fractions have been collected. The polarization Raman 
frequencies and frequency differences of CO stretching vibration for 
NMP/methanol mixture show unique concentration-dependence and abrupt jump 
feature. It is found that the H-bond between solute and solvent does not destroy 
the noncoincidence (NCE) phenomenon, but has a significant synergistic effect on 
the NCE. Two distinctive clusters constrained by H-bond and intermolecular 
interactions were easily determined by means of linear extension method from 
abrupt jump curve. The experimental phenomena can be well explained by 
aggregation-induced splitting theory with the proposed dimer structure and 
H-bond cluster model. Applying the same methodology the conformation of NMP in 
water has been determined successfully. The establishment of this method will 
play an important role in the determination of biomolecule aggregation behavior 
and supramolecular self-assembly structure.

Hydrological drought, a regular phenomenon that could heavily impact natural 
systems and human life, is aggravated by a water storage deficit. While Gravity 
Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite databased drought monitoring 
has been widely studied in East Africa (EA), drought recovery time and 
anthropogenic factors are still missing, which are prerequisite for drought 
management. Here, a water storage deficit index (WSDI) and modified WSDI are 
utilized for analyzing a holistic representation of drought. The results show 
that the drought events in recent times are well-identified and estimated using 
this approach over five lake basins in EA from 2002 to 2021. Although, the basin 
scale drought events are evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) 
from 2002 to 2021. The results showed a significant correlation between WSDI, 
MWSDI, and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in all 
lake basins except in the Tana basin. We show that the presence of anthropogenic 
forcing has increased the highest peak deficits of -2.57, -3.25, -19.05, -87.2, 
and -99 km3 over the Tana, Abaya-Chamo, Turkana, Victoria, and Tanganyika 
basins, respectively. The longest deficit period of 36 months and the highest 
severity value of -1140 were observed in the Turkana and Victoria basins. The 
average drought recovery time ranges from 2.4 to 11.2 months and from 1.4 to 
12.6 months as obtained by WSDI and MWSDI, respectively. Our findings highlight 
the importance of the calculated WSD approach to evaluating the hydrological 
drought characterization and estimate the drought condition at the basin scale.

CONTEXT: With aging, various problems in the reproductive system emerge, 
especially in females. However, our understanding of reproductive aging in 
livestock and humans is limited.
AIMS: We aimed to investigate reproductive changes between young and aged mice.
METHODS: Eight- to ten-week-old female mice were used as the young group, and 
10-month-old mice were studied as the aged group. Reproductive changes were 
investigated from physiological, histological, cytological, and epigenetic 
perspectives.
KEY RESULTS: The estrus cycle was shortened (P <0.0001), and the estradiol (E2) 
concentration was lower in aged mice (P <0.01), whereas the progesterone (P4) 
concentration did not differ between young and aged mice (P >0.05). The 
histological results revealed a lower number of antral follicles in the ovary 
and disordered epithelial tissue structures in the oviducts in aged mice. During 
oogenesis, the surrounded nucleolus (SN)-type oocytes in aged mice exhibited 
increased mitochondrial agglutination (P <0.05) and cellular apoptosis (P <0.01) 
as well as decreased H3K36 triple-methylation (P <0.001). Although many defects 
existed, the oocytes from aged mice could normally support cellular 
reprogramming after somatic cell nuclear transfer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the reduced levels of reproductive 
hormones in aged females lead to shorter estrus cycles and reduced follicular 
development, leading to abnormal oogenesis, particularly in SN-type immature 
oocytes.
IMPLICATIONS: These results provide new insight that enhance our understanding 
and improve the reproductive ability of aged females.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLHIV) are experiencing increased life 
expectancy mostly due to the success of anti-retroviral therapy. Consequently, 
they face the threat of chronic diseases attributed to ageing including 
hypertension. The risk of hypertension among PLHIV requires research attention 
particularly in South Africa where the prevalence of HIV is highest in Africa. 
We therefore examined the prevalence and factors associated with hypertension 
among older people living with HIV in South Africa.
METHODS: We analysed cross-sectional data on 514 older PLHIV. Data were 
extracted from the WHO SAGE Well-Being of Older People Study (WOPS) (2011-2013). 
The outcome variable was hypertension status. Data was analysed using STATA 
Version 14. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were performed. The 
results were presented in odds ratio with its corresponding confidence interval.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension among PLHIV was 50.1%. Compared to PLHIV 
aged 50-59, those aged 60-69 [OR = 2.2; CI = 1.30,3.84], 70-79 years [OR = 2.8; 
CI = 1.37,5.82], and 80 + [OR = 4.9; CI = 1.68,14.05] had higher risk of 
hypertension. Females were more likely [OR = 5.5; CI = 2.67,11.12] than males to 
have hypertension. Persons ever diagnosed with stroke were more likely 
[OR = 3.3; CI = 1.04,10.65] to have hypertension when compared to their 
counterparts who have never been diagnosed with stroke. Compared to PLHIV who 
had no clinic visits, those who visited the clinic three to six times [OR = 5.3; 
CI = 1.35,21.01], or more than six times [OR = 5.5; CI = 1.41,21.41] were more 
likely to have hypertension.
CONCLUSION: More than half of South African older PLHIV are hypertensive. The 
factors associated with hypertension among older PLHIV are age, sex, ever 
diagnosed with stroke and number of times visited the clinic. Integration of 
hypertension management and advocacy in HIV care is urgently needed in South 
Africa in order to accelerate reductions in the prevalence of hypertension among

BACKGROUND: It is known that kidney transplantation (KTx) decreases mortality 
rate and increases life expectancy about 10 years compared with dialysis, 
particularly in patients with diabetes. However, cardiovascular disease is still 
the most common cause of death after transplantation.
PURPOSE: The evaluation of the cardiovascular risk after successful KTx in 
diabetic and nondiabetic patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 344 patients after KTx (mean age 52.7 years, M -62.5%). The 
cohort was divided into 2 groups diabetes (+) and diabetes (-). Arterial 
stiffness parameters (brachial-ankle and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, 
pulse pressure, pulsatile stress was assessed by an automated oscillometric 
device. All body composition parameters were evaluated based on bioelectrical 
impedance analysis and laboratory parameters were obtained from medical files of 
the patients.
RESULTS: Arterial stiffness parameters were higher in the diabetes (+) compared 
with diabetes (-) group, significantly. Body mass index was significantly higher 
in the diabetes (+) group, as well as body fat mass and visceral fat area. In 
the diabetes (+) group compared with the diabetes (-) group, whole-body phase 
angle was lower (4.54 vs 4.90 P = .006). Visceral fat area and whole-body phase 
angle correlated significantly with arterial stiffness parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of arterial stiffness and phase angle is a useful 
method for identifying patients at high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we 
suggest that patients with diabetes after successful KTx due to the baseline 
high cardiolovascular risk, should be regularly assessed to monitor changes in 
blood vessels, body composition and undergo dietary intervention.

Patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase can now 
have a life expectancy comparable to that of the general population thanks to 
the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies. Although most patients 
with CML require lifelong TKI therapy, it is possible for some patients to 
achieve treatment-free remission. These spectacular results have been made 
possible by the development of superior treatment modalities as well as 
clinicians' efforts in strictly adhering to clinical guidelines such as the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Leukemia Network 
(ELN). CML treatment recommendations reported in these guidelines are the result 
of years of selecting and incorporating the most reliable evidence. In this 
review, we provide a synopsis of the differences and similarities that exist 
between the NCCN and ELN guidelines.

Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by 
the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Among them, the kinesin-4 family is a unique motor 
that inhibits microtubule dynamics. Although mutations of kinesin-4 cause 
several diseases, its molecular mechanism is unclear because of the difficulty 
of visualizing the high-resolution structure of kinesin-4 working at the 
microtubule plus-end. Here, we report that KLP-12, a C. elegans kinesin-4 
ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, is essential for proper length control of C. 
elegans axons, and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in 
vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin, 
which represents the high-resolution structural snapshot of the inhibition state 
of microtubule-end dynamics, revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin. 
Comparison with the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, which represent 
the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends, respectively, showed the 
curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 is in between them. Taken together, 
KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the 
microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics.

Plain Language Summary: From meter-long structures that allow nerve cells to 
stretch across a body to miniscule ‘hairs’ required for lung cells to clear 
mucus, many life processes rely on cells sporting projections which have the 
right size for their role. Networks of hollow filaments known as microtubules 
shape these structures and ensure that they have the appropriate dimensions. 
Controlling the length of microtubules is therefore essential for organisms, yet 
how this process takes place is still not fully elucidated. Previous research 
has shown that microtubules continue to grow when their end is straight but stop 
when it is curved. A family of molecular motors known as kinesin-4 participate 
in this process, but the exact mechanisms at play remain unclear. To 
investigate, Tuguchi, Nakano, Imasaki et al. focused on the KLP-12 protein, a 
kinesin-4 equivalent which helps to controls the length of microtubules in the 
tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They performed genetic manipulations and 
imaged the interactions between KLP-12 and the growing end of a microtubule 
using X-ray crystallography. This revealed that KLP-12 controls the length of 
neurons by inhibiting microtubule growth. It does so by modulating the curvature 
of the growing end of the filament to suppress its extension. A ‘snapshot’ of 
KLP-12 binding to a microtubule at the resolution of the atom revealed exactly 
how the protein helps to bend the end of the filament to prevent it from growing 
further. These results will help to understand how nerve cells are shaped. This 
may also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms for various 
neurodegenerative disorders caused by problems with the human equivalents of 
KLP-12, potentially leading to new therapies.

There is a recognized need to better understand changes in the epidemiology of 
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) over time in Asia. Using the Taiwan 
National Health Insurance claim records this population-based study examined 
changes in the prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates in patients with 
psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis in Taiwan over 12 years. Patients with ≥1 
diagnosis code for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, recorded either by 
dermatologists or rheumatologists, were identified. Annual age- and 
sex-standardized prevalence and incidence rates were calculated using the Taiwan 
general population as reference. To investigate mortality, each patient in the 
incident cohort was matched to 10 comparators from the general population by sex 
and age (at diagnosis). The risk of mortality between study cohorts and 
comparators was analysed by Cox proportional hazard regression. The prevalence 
of psoriasis (0.18-0.86%) and psoriatic arthritis (0.01-0.08%) increased 
steadily between 2006 and 2017. The incidence rates, however, remained stable 
(psoriasis: 62-65 per 100,000 person-years; psoriatic arthritis: 6-5 per 100,000 
person-years). The risk of all-cause mortality for patients with psoriasis 
(hazard ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.19) was higher than the 
general population, despite a decreasing trend over time in the all-cause 
mortality rates for both groups. The steady increase in the prevalence of 
psoriasis despite stable incidence rates suggests that improvements in life 
expectancy may be the key determinant of this increase.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that can cause 
adverse effects if not managed effectively. The prevalence of T2DM will continue 
to rise every year, and data from the International Diabetes Federation show 
that the number of patients diagnosed with T2DM in Indonesia is predicted to 
increase from 10.3 million in 2017 to 16.7 million in 2045. Managing T2DM 
properly is a challenge for the patients because they need to implement 
lifestyle changes that involve the self-monitoring of blood glucose, consuming 
prescribed medication properly, maintaining a healthy diet, getting sufficient 
physical training, keeping a healthy sleeping pattern, managing stress properly, 
and consulting medical professionals regularly. The worldwide intervention for 
T2DM focuses on self-management education. The varied results in studies about 
interventions show that no particular intervention method can be regarded as the 
most effective. In Indonesia, there are limited studies on educational 
interventions to improve the quality of life and health of patients with T2DM.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the experiences and needs of patients with 
T2DM in Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to develop effective 
self-management education.
METHODS: The study will use the phenomenology method with purposive sampling to 
collect data. The inclusion criteria are patients in the Chronic Disease 
Self-Management Program at the Sleman Regency Public Health Center who are aged 
≥18 years, diagnosed with T2DM for more than a year, with hemoglobin A1c levels 
≤7.5% and >7.5%, capable of communicating verbally and literate in the 
Indonesian language, not deaf, and willing to participate. The data collection 
is based on the Social Cognitive Theory, which involves selecting assessment 
targets and analyzing personal factors, environment, and behavior that determine 
the knowledge, attitude, and adherence of persons with T2DM. Researchers will 
collect the data through in-depth, face-to-face interviews to learn about 
knowledge, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, outcome experience, worry, illness 
belief, treatment belief, diet, physical activity, medicine intake, treatment 
pattern, support system, as well as ethnic and cultural influences. The results 
will be taken from unstructured and open-ended questions written in Indonesian 
according to the interview guidelines. The data analysis process will go through 
several stages: reading the data thoroughly; coding; sorting the categories; 
creating the themes; making general descriptions; and presenting the data in 
charts, narratives, and recorded quotations from the interviews.
RESULTS: This study received a grant in May 2021 and gained permission from the 
Medical and Health Research Ethics Committee of Universitas Gadjah Mada, 
Indonesia, on July 1, 2021. Data collection started on August 12, 2021, and the 
results are expected to be published in 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will be used to design an educational 
intervention model to improve the knowledge, attitude, and adherence of patients 
with T2DM.

Background: Current guidelines recommend against placement of implantable 
cardioverter defibrillators in patients with a life expectancy less than one 
year. These patients may benefit from early palliative care services; however, 
identifying this population is challenging. Objective: Determine whether a 
validated prognostic tool, based on patient factors and health care utilization 
from electronic medical records, accurately predicts one-year mortality at the 
time of implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement. Design: We used the 
United States (U.S.) Veterans Administration's "Care Assessment Needs" one-Year 
Mortality Score to identify patients at high risk of mortality (score ≥95) 
before their procedure. Data were extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse. 
Logistic regression was used to assess the odds of mortality at different score 
levels. Setting/Subjects: Patients undergoing a new implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator procedure between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2017 in the 
U.S. Veterans Administration. Results: Of 3194 patients with a new implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator placed, 657 (21.8%) had a score ≥95. The mortality 
rate among these patients was 151/657 (22.9%) compared with 281/3194 (8.8%) for 
all patients undergoing a new implantable cardioverter defibrillator procedure. 
Patients with a score ≥95 had 14.0 (95% confidence interval 8.0-24.4) higher 
odds of death within one year of the procedure compared with those with a score 
≤60. Conclusions: The "Care Assessment Needs" Score is a valid predictor of 
one-year mortality following implantable cardioverter defibrillator procedures. 
Integrating its use into the management of Veterans Administration (VA) patients 
considering implantable cardioverter defibrillators may improve shared decision 
making and engagement with palliative care.

BACKGROUND: Childhood epilepsy is a serious and common neurological condition 
and can have life-long consequences and its impact can pervade all aspects of 
family life. Whilst the medical management of seizures is important, much of the 
day-to-day home management of epilepsy is invisible to people external to the 
family, including health care professionals, and parents'/caregivers' fears and 
concerns can go unacknowledged and unaddressed by health care professionals.
OBJECTIVE: This objective of this review was to examine parents'/caregivers' 
fears and concerns regarding their child's epilepsy, the impact of these fears 
and concerns on family life, the social and emotional well-being of 
parents/caregivers and any factors which mitigate these fears and concerns.
DESIGN: Scoping review using a modified version of Arksey and O'Malley's 
framework.
DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies were identified using key search terms in Scopus, 
Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo databases in March 2021 with hand checking of 
reference lists. Search terms were developed using population 
(parents/caregivers of children aged ≤ 18 years with epilepsy, families); 
concept (parents'/caregivers' fears, concerns, anxiety about their child's 
epilepsy); and context (any setting). A further search was run in April 2022. 
Other inclusion criteria: English language empirical studies, 2010-2021.
STUDY APPRAISAL METHODS: A minimum of two reviewers independently screened 
articles and undertook data extraction and decisions were consensually made. 
Methodological quality appraisal was undertaken using the Mixed Methods 
Appraisal Tool v2018. A data extraction table was created to chart all studies. 
The conduct and reporting of this study followed the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance for Systematic 
reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) (S1 Table). 
There is no published copy of the review protocol.
MAIN FINDINGS: The search identified a total of 4077 papers (after duplicates 
were removed) of which 110 were assessed for eligibility. Twenty-four papers 
published between 2010-2021 were included in the review and each paper was 
treated as a separate study. The review findings indicate that 
parents'/caregivers' fears and concerns stem from more than their child's 
seizures and relate to many wider aspects of family life. These fears and 
concerns had far-reaching influences on their parenting/caregiving, and on the 
lifestyle and activities of their child and their family. What was less evident 
was what parents/caregivers wanted in terms of support or how they thought 
health professionals could acknowledge and/or allay their fears and concerns. 
The discussion is framed within the compassion-focused therapy model as a basis 
for generating new thinking about the impact of these fears and concerns and the 
need for a new agenda for clinical consultations in childhood epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The review concludes with a proposal that a more compassionate 
agenda underpins the dialogue between parents/caregivers and clinicians to 
encompass and mitigate the wider emotional, psychosocial, and societal threats 
that impact on the parent/caregivers of children with epilepsy.
