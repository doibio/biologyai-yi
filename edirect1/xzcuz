PURPOSE: Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
coinfection has become a major health problem across the globe. The increased 
life expectancy of HIV-1 patients due to antiretroviral therapy has led to the 
emergence of liver disease as a major mortality factor among them. The purpose 
of the study was to examine the baseline characteristics of HBV in 
treatment-naïve HBV/HIV coinfection from southern India compared to monoinfected 
individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was cross sectional in design, and samples were 
examined from 80 HIV-1, 70 HBV and 35 HBV/HIV-coinfected individuals using 
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, real-time polymerase chain reaction 
and flow cytometry assays.
RESULTS: There was a significant increase in HBV DNA (P = 0.0001), higher 
hepatitis B e antigen percentage difference (P = 0.027) and lower CD4 counts (P 
= 0.01) among the HBV/HIV-coinfected individuals, but no difference in the HIV-1 
viral load compared to HIV-1-monoinfected individuals. Also, the aspartate 
aminotransferase levels, prothrombin time and the international normalised ratio 
were significantly high among coinfected individuals.
CONCLUSION: These findings conclude that HIV-1 coinfection can have serious 
implications on the outcome of HBV-related liver disease. To the contrary, HBV 
infection had no consequence on the progression of HIV-1 disease but distinctly 
lowered CD4+ T-cells.

AIMS: Although risk scores to predict type 2 diabetes exist, cost-effectiveness 
of risk thresholds to target prevention interventions are unknown. We applied 
cost-effectiveness analysis to identify optimal thresholds of predicted risk to 
target a low-cost community-based intervention in the USA.
METHODS: We used a validated Markov-based type 2 diabetes simulation model to 
evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of diabetes 
risk. Population characteristics for the model were obtained from NHANES 
2001-2004 and incidence rates and performance of two noninvasive diabetes risk 
scores (German diabetes risk score, GDRS, and ARIC 2009 score) were determined 
in the ARIC and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for increasing risk score 
thresholds. Two scenarios were assumed: 1-stage (risk score only) and 2-stage 
(risk score plus fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test (threshold 100 mg/dl) in the 
high-risk group).
RESULTS: In ARIC and CHS combined, the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve for the GDRS and the ARIC 2009 score were 0.691 
(0.677-0.704) and 0.720 (0.707-0.732), respectively. The optimal threshold of 
predicted diabetes risk (ICER < $50,000/QALY gained in case of intervention in 
those above the threshold) was 7% for the GDRS and 9% for the ARIC 2009 score. 
In the 2-stage scenario, ICERs for all cutoffs ≥ 5% were below $50,000/QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Intervening in those with ≥ 7% diabetes risk based on the GDRS 
or ≥ 9% on the ARIC 2009 score would be cost-effective. A risk score 
threshold ≥ 5% together with elevated FPG would also allow targeting 
interventions cost-effectively.

Why the book "More than Medicine: the Broken Promise of American Health" is 
important to the future of behavioral medicine, health psychology, and public 
health.

Wilson DK(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA.

In his book, "More than Medicine: The Broken Promise of American Health," Robert 
Kaplan brings together extensive data to make the case that healthcare 
priorities in the USA need to place greater emphasis on behavioral, social and 
environmental determinants of health. Kaplan argues that the effect sizes for 
health outcomes resulting from environmental exposures, stress, and 
socioeconomic status are all much larger than are many traditional biological 
risk factors. There are discrepancies between estimates of how much the National 
Institutes of Health spends on behavioral and social sciences research, but an 
independent evaluation suggests it is <5% of the entire budget. Addressing this 
neglect requires advocacy and bringing together of like-minded organizations to 
promote more funding for behavioral interventions, health promotion and public 
health policies to address important contextual factors such as poverty, lack of 
education, and poor environmental conditions. Importantly, Kaplan argues that 
several metrics to integrate life expectancy and quality of life have been 
proposed and allow healthcare providers to prioritize the value of health over 
the volume of healthcare delivered. Although standards exist, there are still a 
limited number of studies on the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of 
behavioral and public health interventions.

BACKGROUND: MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a new 
minimally invasive treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with limited 
effectiveness data. It is unknown if the cost savings associated with shorter 
hospitalization could offset the high equipment cost of MRgLITT. We examined the 
cost-utility of MRgLITT versus surgery for TLE from healthcare payer 
perspective, and the value of additional research to inform policy decision on 
MRgLITT.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to evaluate quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MRgLITT 
versus surgery in TLE, assuming life-time horizon and 1.5% discount rate. Model 
inputs were derived from the literature. We conducted threshold and sensitivity 
analyses to examine parameter uncertainties, and expected value of partial 
perfect information analyses to evaluate the expected monetary benefit of 
eliminating uncertainty on probabilities associated with MRgLITT.
RESULTS: MRgLITT yielded 0.08 more QALYs and cost $7,821 higher than surgery, 
with ICER of $94,350/QALY. Influential parameters that could change model 
outcomes include probabilities of becoming seizure-free from disabling seizures 
state and returning to disabling seizures from seizure-free state 5 years after 
surgery and MRgLITT, cost of MRgLITT disposable equipment, and utilities of 
disabling seizures and seizure-free states of surgery and MRgLITT. The 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed surgery was preferred in more than 
50% of iterations. The expected monetary benefit of eliminating uncertainty for 
probabilities associated with MRgLITT was higher than for utilities associated 
with MRgLITT.
CONCLUSIONS: MRgLITT resulted in more QALYs gained and higher costs compared to 
surgery in the base-case. The model was sensitive to variations in the cost of 
MRgLITT disposable equipment. There is value in conducting more research to 
reduce uncertainty on the probabilities and utilities of MRgLITT, but priority 
should be given to research focusing on improving the precision of estimates on 
effectiveness of MRgLITT.

Background. OnabotulinumtoxinA injections improve upper-limb spasticity after 
stroke, but their effect on arm function remains uncertain. Objective. To 
determine whether a single treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA injections combined 
with upper-limb physiotherapy improves grasp release compared with physiotherapy 
alone after stroke. Methods. A total of 28 patients, at least 1 month 
poststroke, were randomized to receive either onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo 
injections to the affected upper limb followed by standardized upper-limb 
physiotherapy (10 sessions over 4 weeks). The primary outcome was time to 
release grasp during a functionally relevant standardized task. Secondary 
outcomes included measures of wrist and finger spasticity and strength using a 
customized servomotor, clinical assessments of stiffness (modified Ashworth 
Scale), arm function (Action Research Arm Test [ARAT], Nine Hole Peg Test), arm 
use (Arm Measure of Activity), Goal Attainment Scale, and quality of life 
(EQ5D). Results. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in 
grasp release time 5 weeks post injection (placebo median = 3.0 s, treatment 
median = 2.0 s; t(24) = 1.20; P = .24; treatment effect = -0.44, 95% CI = -1.19 
to 0.31). None of the secondary measures passed significance after correcting 
for multiple comparisons. Both groups achieved their treatment goals (placebo = 
65%; treatment = 71%), and made improvements on the ARAT (placebo +3, treatment 
+5) and in active wrist extension (placebo +9°, treatment +11°). Conclusions. In 
this group of stroke patients with mild to moderate spastic hemiparesis, a 
single treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA did not augment the improvements seen 
in grasp release time after a standardized upper-limb physiotherapy program.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The pilot study deals with the current situation in 
proximal femoral fractures in culturally diverse regions, namely in Afghanistan 
(AFG) and in the Czech Republic (CZ). The study aimed to find out whether there 
are any differences in proximal femoral fractures in dependence on the selected 
criteria between the two culturally diverse areas. The study used the data of 
patients who underwent surgery for proximal femoral fracture at the Department 
of Orthopaedics of the 1 s t Medical Faculty of the Charles University and the 
Military University Hospital and at the Military Base Hospital Kabul. MATERIAL 
AND METHODS The study included patients aged 21 years or older who sustained a 
proximal femoral fracture in the period from October 2013 to February 2014. For 
the period concerned, the evaluation comprised 44 patients with a proximal 
femoral fracture from the Military Base Hospital Kabul, of whom 25 women and 19 
men, and a total of 71 patients with a proximal femoral fracture from the 
Department of Orthopaedics of the 1st Medical Faculty of the Charles University 
and the Military University Hospital, of whom 43 women and 28 men. Based on the 
medical documentation, the following evaluation parameters were selected: age, 
sex, type of fracture. The data was processed using descriptive statistics, 
one-way and multifactorial analysis (ANOVA) and the POST-HOC test (Fisher LSD 
test, confidence interval = 95%) RESULTS The mean age of all the patients who 
suffered a fracture of proximal femur in AFG (58 years) was considerably lower 
(p < 0.001) than in patients in CZ (81 years). Similarly, a significant 
difference (p <0.001) was identified in the age of men and women treated for a 
proximal femoral fracture in both the countries. In AFG there was a 
statistically significant difference (p = 0.002) between the age of men and 
women, where women sustaining fractures were younger (54 years) compared to men 
(63 years). In CZ no significant age difference was reported (83 years vs 78 
years). In AFG, the observed fractures occurred generally in their 6th and 7th 
decade, whereas in CZ only in their 9th decade. The incidence of proximal 
femoral fractures in Afghan women is the highest in their 5th and 6th decade. 
Pertrochanteric fractures and intracapsular fractures prevailed in both 
countries. The lowest age in both types of the fracture was reported in Afghan 
women (52 years in femoral neck fracture, p <0.001, 54 years in trochanteric 
fracture, p = 0.039). DISCUSSION Significant differences between the patients in 
AFG and CZ concern several factors. Afghanistan is a country with the lowest 
average life expectancy. In the Afghan population a major Vitamin D deficiency 
was confirmed. This is related to the conservative dress code, especially in 
women, when the Vitamin D synthesis is suppressed. That can cause the occurrence 
of osteoporosis in women at a considerably younger age than in the population in 
the Czech Republic, which is subsequently accompanied by an increased incidence 
of proximal femoral fractures. Similar results, however, were also obtained in 
men. One of the risk factors of osteoporosis development is also low physical 
activity throughout the lifetime. This risk factor is significant primarily in 
female population in the Muslim world. Afghanistan also faces serious 
malnutrition. All of that is reflected in low life expectancy in the given 
country, incidence of osteoporosis and injuries in this region. There is 
reasonable evidence that the mortality in a causal relationship with proximal 
femoral fracture is substantially higher in this region than in Western Europe. 
CONCLUSIONS The results of the pilot study showed that there are significant 
differences in age and frequency of fractures in dependence on sex and country. 
The obtained results can be considered valuable since there are virtually no 
scientific or professional studies on osteoporosis and fractures in the given 
area that would help physicians get ready for significant differences. These 
results may become a source of valuable information not only for medical 
practitioners coming to Afghanistan to help as volunteers in the framework of 
developmental assistance from all over the world, but also for physicians from 
Europe, with respect to the wave of migrants coming from this area. Key words: 
proximal femur, fracture, gender, age, Afghanistan, Czech Republic.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: an increased value of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) is now universally considered a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
factor. LDL-C is included in the vast majority of worldwide cardiovascular risk 
prediction algorithms, as well as in the guidelines for cardiovascular risk 
prevention. We aimed to provide an overview of the worldwide adverse healthcare 
impact of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on the epidemiologic burden of LDL-C >1.3 mmol/L were 
retrieved from Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) registry. The current burden 
is 94.92 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), with an exponential 
increase occurred during the past 25 years. 4.32 million deaths can be 
attributed to LDL cholesterol values > 1.3 mmol/L. DALYs and deaths due to LDL-C 
have significantly increased in all countries except those with high 
socio-demographic index.
CONCLUSION: More effective structural healthcare policies shall be planned at a 
worldwide scale for contrasting the epidemics of LDL-C attributable heath loss.

BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer 
screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of 
personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family 
history to uniform screening.
METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 
40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were 
categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We 
varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening 
scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) 
compared the cost-effectiveness of both.
RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform 
screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 
74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario 
consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk 
who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these 
scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was 
not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with 
determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was 
cost-effective when these costs were less than ∼$48.
CONCLUSIONS: Uniform colorectal cancer screening currently appears more 
cost-effective than personalized screening based on polygenic risk and family 
history. However, cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on the cost of 
determining risk.
IMPACT: Personalized screening could become increasingly viable as costs for 
determining risk decrease.

OBJECTIVES: Recent studies with lung MRI (MRI) have shown high sensitivity (Sn) 
and specificity (Sp) for lung nodule detection and characterization relative to 
low-dose CT (LDCT). Using this background data, we sought to compare the 
potential screening performance of MRI vs. LDCT using a Markov model of lung 
cancer screening.
METHODS: We created a Markov cohort model of lung cancer screening which 
incorporated lung cancer incidence, progression, and mortality based on gender, 
age, and smoking burden. Sensitivity (Sn) and Sp for LDCT were taken from the 
MISCAN Lung Microsimulation and Sn/Sp for MRI was estimated from a published 
substudy of the German Lung Cancer Screening and Intervention Trial. Screening, 
work-up, and treatment costs were estimated from published data. Screening with 
MRI and LDCT was simulated for a cohort of male and female smokers (2 packs per 
day; 36 pack/years of smoking history) starting at age 60. We calculated the 
screening performance and cost-effectiveness of MRI screening and performed a 
sensitivity analysis on MRI Sn/Sp and cost.
RESULTS: There was no difference in life expectancy between MRI and LDCT 
screening (males 13.28 vs. 13.29 life-years; females 14.22 vs. 14.22 
life-years). MRI had a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio of $258,169 in men and 
$403,888 in women driven by fewer false-positive screens. On sensitivity 
analysis, MRI remained cost effective at screening costs < $396 dollars and Sp > 
81%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this Markov model of lung cancer screening, MRI has a 
near-equivalent life expectancy benefit and has superior cost-effectiveness 
relative to LDCT.
KEY POINTS: • In this Markov model of lung cancer screening, there is no 
difference in mortality between yearly screening with MRI and low-dose CT. • 
Compared to low-dose CT, screening with MRI led to a reduction in false-positive 
studies from 26 to 2.8% in men and 26 to 2.6% in women. • Due to similar 
life-expectancy and reduced false-positive rate, we found a favorable 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $258,169 in men and $403,888 in women of MRI 
relative to low-dose CT.

PURPOSE: Comorbidity assessment is essential in the triage of care for men with 
prostate cancer (PC). The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version 
of the revised Charlson index (RCI) in PC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 731 PC patients diagnosed from 1993 to 2008 were referred 
to our Radiation Oncology Department. The RCI classified patients into four 
categories RCI 0, RCI 1-2, RCI 3-4, and RCI 5 and higher. The Kaplan-Meier 
method and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used. We also analyzed the 
median age of patients who remained alive at the last control and those who died 
due to non-prostate cancer comorbidities.
RESULTS: 636 patients were included median age: 70 years (44-85). The mean 
follow-up was 153.62 months, (6-288 months). Distribution of the D'Amico risk 
classification was 21%, 38.2%, and 40.8% for low, intermediate, and high risk, 
respectively. The RCI distribution categories were: 303 (46.7%) RCI 0, 102 (16%) 
RCI 1-2, 131 (20.6%) RCI 3-4, and 100 (15.7%) RCI 5 and higher. The probability 
of non-cause-specific mortality at 5 and 10 years was 2. 4% and 11.25% RCI 0, 3 
and 14.1% RCI 1-2, 5.7% and 22.1% RCI 3-4, and 47% and 92% (RCI 5 and higher). 
The median age in the last control in patients alive or who had died by non-PC 
causes was 82.81 years (55.27-102).
DISCUSSION: The RCI may be used to aid medical decision making in older Spanish 
men with PC, especially in those with a high RCI 5 and higher.

The relationship between differential mortality rates and differences in life 
expectancy is well understood, but how changing differential rates translate 
into changing differences in life expectancy has not been fully explained. To 
elucidate the mechanism involved, this study extends existing decomposition 
methods. The extended method decomposes change in the sex gap in life expectancy 
at birth into three components capturing the effects of the sex difference in 
mortality improvement (ρ-effect), life table deaths density by age (f-effect), 
and remaining life expectancy by age (e-effect). These three effects oppose and 
augment each other, depending on relative change in sex-differential mortality 
rates. The new method is applied to period data for 35 countries and cohort data 
for 25 countries. The results demonstrate how the mechanism, involving the three 
effects, operates to determine change in the sex difference in life expectancy. 
We observe the pivotal importance of the f-effect, which is predominantly 
negative because of lower female mortality, in favoring narrowing rather than 
widening of the sex gap, in shifting the overall effect to younger ages, and in 
exaggerating fluctuations due to crisis mortality. The new decomposition 
provides a more detailed basis for substantive analyses examining change in 
differences in life expectancy.

Background: The life expectancy for HIV-infected individuals has improved 
dramatically because of improvements in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Today, a 
simplified two-drug regimen enhances adherence and treatment satisfaction by 
reducing adverse effects. Therefore, we need more evidence to show the benefits 
and risks of simplified ART regimens from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
We compared the efficacy and safety of raltegravir-based simplified dual therapy 
(DT) and of traditional triple therapy (TT) for people living with HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA). Methods: We carried out a systematic review of RCTs. After using a 
combination of the key words "HIV," "raltegravir," and "protease inhibitor" to 
search the English-language electronic databases from January 1, 2004, to 
September 11, 2019, we pooled data across eligible studies and estimated the 
summary effect sizes with Review Manager (version 5.3). Results: We included 
eight RCTs involving 4420 PLWHA: 2187 (49.5%) received raltegravir-based 
simplified DT, and 2144 (48.5%) received traditional TT. The proportion of viral 
suppression was 79% at 48 weeks and 74% at 96 weeks in the simplified regimen, 
and the proportion of viral suppression was 78% at 48 weeks and 71% at 96 weeks 
in the traditional TT group. Furthermore, the proportion of viral suppression in 
the simplified DT group was greater than that in the TT group at 24 weeks (risk 
ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.21; p = 0.01). The CD4 cell counts in 
the simplified DT group were significantly higher at 48 weeks and 96 weeks than 
those in the group that received the traditional TT. Regarding adverse events 
and mortality rates, the DT and TT groups were similar. However, there was 
better adherence in the DT group than in the TT group. Conclusion: We found that 
the simplified regimen was noninferior to TT regimen in regard to viral 
suppression. Furthermore, the simplified DT regimen had a better CD4 cell count 
and lower adverse events than the TT regimen.

INTRODUCTION: A major barrier to improving childhood cancer survival is the 
perception that paediatric oncology services are too costly for low-income and 
middle-income country (LMIC) health systems. We conducted a systematic review to 
synthesise existing evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of treating 
childhood cancers in LMICs.
METHODS: We searched multiple databases from their inception to March 2019. All 
studies reporting costs or cost-effectiveness of treating any childhood cancer 
in an LMIC were included. We appraised included articles using the Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Where 
possible, we extracted or calculated the cost per disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) averted using reported survival and country-specific life expectancy. 
Cost/DALY averted was compared with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as 
per WHO-Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective guidelines to determine 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Of 2802 studies identified, 30 met inclusion criteria. Studies 
represented 22 countries and nine different malignancies. The most commonly 
studied cancers were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=10), Burkitt lymphoma 
(n=4) and Wilms tumour (n=3). The median CHEERS checklist score was 18 of 24. 
Many studies omitted key cost inputs. Notably, only 11 studies included 
healthcare worker salaries. Cost/DALY averted was extracted or calculated for 12 
studies and ranged from US$22 to US$4475, although the lower-end costs were 
primarily from studies that omitted key cost components. In all 12, cost/DALY 
averted through treatment was substantially less than country per capita GDP, 
and therefore considered very cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Many included studies did not account for key cost inputs, thus 
underestimating true treatment costs. Costs/DALY averted were nonetheless 
substantially lower than per capita GDP, suggesting that even if all relevant 
inputs are included, LMIC childhood cancer treatment is consistently very 
cost-effective. While additional rigorous economic evaluations are required, our 
results can inform the development of LMIC national childhood cancer strategies.

Pre-auricular sinus usually presents in front of the auricle without any 
diagnostic dilemma. But confusion arises when it presents with post-auricular 
swelling, abscess or discharging sinus. Here we describe series of pre-auricular 
sinus with post-auricular extension, a "variant type" of pre-auricular sinus and 
their management. A prospective study was done in the department of ENT in a 
tertiary care hospital of West Bengal from April 2015 to March 2018. After 
control of infection and proper pre-operative investigations patients, sinus was 
excised using bi-directional approach. The sinus tract along with a thin rim of 
conchal cartilage and pre and post-auricular cuff of skin was excised in toto. 
Among 76 cases of pre-auricular sinus, seven had "variant type". There were five 
males and two females in the variant group. Five patients were in the first 
decade of life and two patients were in the second decade of life. Four patients 
presented with post-auricular scar, two patients presented with post-auricular 
discharging sinus and one patient presented with post-auricular abscess. Wound 
healing was perfectly normal in all patients. None had recurrence till 1 year 
follow up. Pre-auricular sinus may present as "variant type" with post-auricular 
abscess or discharging sinus. So when a patient presents with post-auricular 
abscess or discharging sinus, pre-auricular region and pinna should be examined 
carefully. This helps to avoid unnecessary investigations and interventions 
which only complicate future management of these patients.

BACKGROUND: The hip joint is the largest joint after the knee, which gives 
stability to the whole human structure. The hip joint consists of a femoral head 
which articulates with the acetabulum. Due to age and wear between the joints, 
these joints need to be replaced with implants which can function just as a 
natural joint. Since the early 19th century, the hip joint arthroplasty has 
evolved, and many advances have been taken in the field which improved the whole 
procedure. Currently, there is a wide variety of implants available varying in 
the length of stem, shapes, and sizes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this analytical study of femur, circular, oval, ellipse 
and trapezoidal-shaped stem designs are considered in the present study. The 
human femur is modeled using Mimics. CATIA V-6 is used to model the implant 
models. Static structural analysis is carried out using ANSYS R-19 to evaluate 
the best implant design.
RESULTS: All the four hip implants exhibited the von Mises stresses, lesser than 
its yielded strength. However, circular and trapezoidal-shaped stems have less 
von Mises stress compared to ellipse and oval.
CONCLUSION: This study shows the behavior of different implant designs when 
their cross-sections are varied. Further, these implants can be considered for 
dynamic analysis considering different gait cycles. By optimizing the implant 
design, life expectancy of the implant can be improved, which will avoid the 
revision of the hip implant in active adult patients.

BACKGROUND: Second primary tumors (SPTs) are a common cause of reduced life 
expectancy in patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC). This phenomenon 
forms an area to be addressed during posttreatment follow-up.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature following PRISMA 
guidelines, from 1979 to 2019, to investigate incidence of SPTs, synchronous, 
and metachronous, in HNC population.
RESULTS: Our review includes data of 456 130 patients from 61 articles. With a 
minimum follow-up of 22 months, mean incidence of SPTs was 13.2% (95% CI: 
11.56-14.84): 5.3% (95% CI: 4.24-6.36) for synchronous SPTs and 9.4% (95% CI: 
7.9-10.9) for metachronous SPTs. The most frequent site for SPTs was head and 
neck area, followed by the lungs and esophagus.
CONCLUSION: Although with wide variations between studies, the rate of SPTs in 
HNC patients is high. Given the impact in the prognosis, we must develop 
strategies for the early diagnosis of SPTs.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) continues to be the most common life-limiting 
chronic pulmonary disease in adolescents and young adults. Treatment of CF 
demands a high treatment time investment to slow the progression of lung 
function decline, the most important contributor to morbidity and mortality. 
Adherence is challenging in CF due to the high treatment burden and the lack of 
immediate health consequences in case of nonadherence. Lung function decline is 
particularly pronounced in the transition phase between 12 and 24 years of age. 
The improvement of self-management and self-responsibility and independence from 
parents and desire for normalcy are conflicting aspects for many adolescents 
with CF, which influence adherence to the time-consuming pulmonary therapy. 
Mobile health (mHealth) care apps could help to support self-management and 
independence and thereby reconcile seemingly conflicting goals to improve 
adherence, quality of life, and ultimately CF life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) assess user behavior and satisfaction among 
adolescents and young adults with CF over an observation period of three months 
using an mHealth app; (2) identify areas of improvement for this mHealth app; 
and (3) compare overall and disease-specific satisfaction, lung function, and 
anthropometry before and after using the mHealth app.
METHODS: A total of 27 adolescents and young adults with CF (age range 12-24 
years, mean age 16 years, SD 3 years; 14 females, 11 males) used a free mHealth 
app for three months of whom 25 provided questionnaire data for analysis at the 
end of the study. Data collection was carried out using questionnaires on usage 
characteristics and life satisfaction, and standardized assessment of lung 
function and anthropometry.
RESULTS: The use of the reminder function for medication declined from 70% 
(15/21) of the participants at week 4 to 65% (13/20) at week 8 of the 
observation period. At the end of the study, only 17% (4/23) of the participants 
wanted to continue using the app. Nevertheless, 56% (14/25) of participants saw 
the mobile app as a support for everyday life. Potential improvements targeting 
hedonistic qualities were identified to improve mHealth app adherence. 
Comparisons of satisfaction with different life aspects hinted at improvements 
or stabilization for the subitem respiration and the subitem lack of handicap by 
CF, suggesting that app use might stabilize certain CF-specific aspects of the 
weighted satisfaction with life. Lung function and anthropometry were not 
affected consistently.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients did not want to continue using the app after 
the study period. Only a few CF-specific aspects of weighted life satisfaction 
were possibly stabilized by the mHealth app; clinical parameters were not 
affected. Adaptation of the functions to adolescent-specific needs could improve 
the long-term use and thus positively affect the disease course.

BACKGROUND: To examine the impact of combined lifestyle factors on premature 
mortality and life expectancy in Chinese adults.
METHODS: A total of 44,052 Chinese adults aged 45-74 years free of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and diabetes were followed from 
recruitment (1993-1998) to the end of 2016 in the Singapore Chinese Health 
Study. A composite score (0-5 scale) was calculated based on five baseline 
healthy lifestyle factors including healthy diet, nonsmoking status, light to 
moderate alcohol drinking, being physically active and optimal body mass index. 
Mortality cases were identified through linkage with the nationwide death 
registry.
