antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids (OCSs) in the previous year.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised (1 : 1) to receive either low-dose 
theophylline or placebo for 1 year. The dose of theophylline (200 mg once or 
twice a day) was determined by ideal body weight and smoking status.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: The number of participant-reported exacerbations in the 1-year 
treatment period that were treated with antibiotics and/or OCSs.
RESULTS: A total of 1578 people were randomised (60% from primary care): 791 to 
theophylline and 787 to placebo. There were 11 post-randomisation exclusions. 
Trial medication was prescribed to 1567 participants: 788 in the theophylline 
arm and 779 in the placebo arm. Participants in the trial arms were well 
balanced in terms of characteristics. The mean age was 68.4 [standard deviation 
(SD) 8.4] years, 54% were male, 32% smoked and mean FEV1 was 51.7% (SD 20.0%) 
predicted. Primary outcome data were available for 98% of participants: 772 in 
the theophylline arm and 764 in the placebo arm. There were 1489 person-years of 
follow-up data. The mean number of exacerbations was 2.24 (SD 1.99) for 
participants allocated to theophylline and 2.23 (SD 1.97) for participants 
allocated to placebo [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.99, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.08]. Low-dose theophylline had no significant effects on 
lung function (i.e. FEV1), incidence of pneumonia, mortality, breathlessness or 
measures of quality of life or disease impact. Hospital admissions due to COPD 
exacerbation were less frequent with low-dose theophylline (adjusted IRR 0.72, 
95% CI 0.55 to 0.94). However, 39 of the 51 excess hospital admissions in the 
placebo group were accounted for by 10 participants having three or more 
exacerbations. There were no differences in the reporting of theophylline side 
effects between the theophylline and placebo arms.
LIMITATIONS: A higher than expected percentage of participants (26%) ceased 
trial medication; this was balanced between the theophylline and placebo arms 
and mitigated by over-recruitment (n = 154 additional participants were 
recruited) and the high rate of follow-up. The limitation of not using 
documented exacerbations is addressed by evidence that patient recall is highly 
reliable and the results of a small within-trial validation study.
CONCLUSION: For people with COPD at high risk of exacerbation, the addition of 
low-dose oral theophylline to a drug regimen that includes ICSs confers no 
overall clinical or health economic benefit. This result was evident from the 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.
FUTURE WORK: To promote consideration of the findings of this trial in national 
and international COPD guidelines.

Plain Language Summary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a 
long-term lung disease that cannot be cured. The main symptom is shortness of 
breath on exertion. In the UK, about 1.2 million people have COPD. It is a major 
cause of death and costs the NHS > £1B a year. Sudden ‘flare-ups’ of symptoms 
often need emergency treatment, shorten life expectancy and reduce people’s 
ability to get on with their lives. Theophylline is a drug that has been around 
for decades. In the past, it was used in high doses to treat COPD by opening up 
airways. However, its benefits were limited and it often caused unpleasant side 
effects. High-dose theophylline has been replaced by drugs administered by 
inhalers, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Recent work in the laboratory 
and in animal models suggests that, at low dose, theophylline could make ICSs 
work better in COPD with none of the side effects of high-dose theophylline. The 
Theophylline With Inhaled CorticoSteroid (TWICS) trial tested whether or not 
adding low-dose theophylline reduces flare-ups in people with COPD taking ICSs. 
A total of 1578 people with COPD from 121 centres all over the UK took part. 
Participants were randomly divided into two groups: one group took low-dose 
theophylline and the other took dummy placebo pills. Participants were asked to 
attend visits at 6 and 12 months. A total of 791 participants were prescribed 
low-dose theophylline and 787 were prescribed dummy placebo pills. Although not 
everyone took the tablets for a whole year, it was possible to count the number 
of flare-ups in 98% of those taking part. In total, there were 3430 flare-ups. 
On average, the people taking low-dose theophylline had 2.24 flare-ups and the 
people taking placebo had 2.23 flare-ups. Overall, the trial showed that, for 
people with COPD, taking low-dose theophylline on top of steroid inhalers makes 
no real difference.

national strength and conditioning association. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 
2019-2052, 2019-Aging, even in the absence of chronic disease, is associated 
with a variety of biological changes that can contribute to decreases in 
skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. Such losses decrease physiologic 
resilience and increase vulnerability to catastrophic events. As such, 
strategies for both prevention and treatment are necessary for the health and 
well-being of older adults. The purpose of this Position Statement is to provide 
an overview of the current and relevant literature and provide evidence-based 
recommendations for resistance training for older adults. As presented in this 
Position Statement, current research has demonstrated that countering muscle 
disuse through resistance training is a powerful intervention to combat the loss 
of muscle strength and muscle mass, physiological vulnerability, and their 
debilitating consequences on physical functioning, mobility, independence, 
chronic disease management, psychological well-being, quality of life, and 
healthy life expectancy. This Position Statement provides evidence to support 
recommendations for successful resistance training in older adults related to 4 
parts: (a) program design variables, (b) physiological adaptations, (c) 
functional benefits, and (d) considerations for frailty, sarcopenia, and other 
chronic conditions. The goal of this Position Statement is to a) help foster a 
more unified and holistic approach to resistance training for older adults, b) 
promote the health and functional benefits of resistance training for older 
adults, and c) prevent or minimize fears and other barriers to implementation of 
resistance training programs for older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatic hemangioendothelioma is a rare benign tumor in children, 
which frequently occurs in the first year of life. The clinical presentation is 
variable and the diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, and laboratory and 
imaging studies. The objective was to describe a case of multifocal hepa tic 
hemangioendothelioma.
CLINICAL REPORT: 3-month-old girl who presented hepatomegaly without elements of 
hepatic or heart failure. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan were used to diagnose 
hepatic hemangioendothelioma, which was confirmed by CT abdominal angiography. 
The patient received glucocorticoid treatment at high doses for a prolonged 
period. A year and a half after treatment, there was evidence of tumor 
remission. She had side effects from the established treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients with isolated hepatomegaly, it should be 
considered a probable tumor patho logy, considering the clinic and imaging 
studies. Possible complications and treatments risks must always be assessed. In 
this case, the tumor extension and its probable complications justified the use 
of prolonged corticosteroid therapy at high doses despite its adverse effects.

Bipolar disorders (BDs) are prevalent mental health illnesses that affect about 
1-5% of the total population, have a chronic course and are associated with a 
markedly elevated premature mortality. One of the contributors for the decreased 
life expectancy in BD is suicide. Accordingly, the rate of suicide among BD 
patients is approximately 10-30 times higher than the corresponding rate in the 
general population. Extant research found that up to 20% of (mostly untreated) 
BD subjects end their life by suicide, and 20-60% of them attempt suicide at 
least one in their lifetime. In our paper we briefly recapitulate the current 
knowledge on the epidemiological aspects of suicide in BD as well as factors 
associated with suicidal risk in BD. Furthermore, we also discuss concisely the 
possible means of suicide prevention in BD.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is commonly used to kill rodents. However, a large body of 
research has now established that CO2 is aversive to them. A multidisciplinary 
symposium organized by the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office 
discussed the drawbacks and alternatives to CO2 in euthanasia protocols for 
laboratory animals. Dialogue was facilitated by brainstorming sessions in small 
groups and a "World Café". A conclusion from this process was that alternatives 
to CO2 were urgently required, including a program of research and extension to 
meet the needs for humane killing of these animals. The next step will involve 
gathering a group of international experts to formulate, draft, and publish a 
research strategy on alternatives to CO2.

BACKGROUND: Biomedical interventions such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are highly effective for prevention of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, China has not released national 
PrEP guidelines, and HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is 
unchanged despite substantial scale-up of ART. We evaluated reductions in HIV 
transmission that may be achieved through early initiation of ART plus partners' 
PrEP.
METHODS: Six intervention scenarios were evaluated in terms of their impact on 
HIV transmission and their cost-effectiveness for 36 months post-infection. 
Three scenarios were based on observed data: non-ART, standard-ART, and 
early-ART. Another three scenarios were based on observed and hypothetical data: 
non-ART plus partners' PrEP, standard-ART plus partners' PrEP, and early-ART 
plus partners' PrEP. The number of onward transmissions was calculated according 
to viral load and self-reported sexual behaviors, and calibrated by the 
prevalence and incidence of HIV among Chinese MSM. Cost-effectiveness outcomes 
were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-utility ratio (CUR).
RESULTS: The estimated number of onward transmissions by every 100 HIV-positive 
cases 36 months post-infection was 41.83 (95% credible interval: 30.75-57.69) in 
the non-ART scenario, 7.95 (5.85-10.95) in the early-ART scenario, and 0.79 
(0.58-1.09) in the early-ART plus partners' PrEP scenario. Compared with 
non-ART, the early-ART and early-ART plus partners' PrEP scenarios were 
associated with an 81.0 and 98.1% reduction in HIV transmission, and had a CUR 
of $12,864/QALY and $16,817/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated delivery of early ART and sexual partners' PrEP could 
nearly eliminate HIV transmission and reduce costs during the first 36 months of 
HIV infection. Our results suggest a feasible and cost-effective strategy for 
reversing the HIV epidemic among MSM in China.

BACKGROUND: Health state utility (HSU) is a core component of QALYs and 
cost-effectiveness analysis, although HSU is rarely estimated among a 
representative sample of patients. We explored the feasibility of assessing HSU 
in head and neck cancer from the French National Hospital Discharge database.
METHODS: An exhaustive sample of 53,258 incident adult patients with a first 
diagnosis of head and neck cancer was identified in 2010-2012. We used a 
cross-sectional approach to define five health states over two periods: three 
"cancer stages at initial treatment" (early, locally advanced or metastatic 
stage); a "relapse state" and otherwise a "relapse-free state" in the follow-up 
of patients initially treated at early or locally advanced stage. In patients 
admitted in post-acute care, a two-parameter graded response model (Item 
Response Theory) was estimated from all 144,012 records of six Activities of 
Daily Living (ADLs) and the latent health state scale underlying ADLs was 
calibrated with the French EQ-5D-3 L social value set. Following linear 
interpolation between all assessments of the patient, daily estimates of utility 
in post-acute care were averaged by health state, patient and month of 
follow-up. Finally, HSU was estimated by health state and month of follow-up for 
the whole patient population after controlling for survivorship and selection in 
post-acute care.
RESULTS: Head and neck cancer was generally associated with poor HSU estimates 
in a real-life setting. As compared to "distant metastasis at initial 
treatment", mean HSU was higher in other health states, although numerical 
differences were small (0.45 versus around 0.54). It was primarily explained by 
the negative effects on HSU of an older age (38.4% aged ≥70 years in "early 
stage at initial treatment") and comorbidities (> 50% in other health states). 
HSU estimates significantly improved over time in the "relapse-free state" (from 
8 to 12 months of follow-up).
CONCLUSIONS: HSU estimates in head and neck cancer were primarily driven by age 
at diagnosis, comorbidities, and time to assessment of cancer survivors. This 
feasibility study highlights the potential of estimating HSU within and across 
severe conditions in a systematic way at the national level.

Aging is a complex process, with genetic and environmental influences, that 
unfolds over time. The rate at which skin aging proceeds is predictable, 
although many persons appear older or younger than their chronologic age. This 
is especially evident in rare genetic disorders such as Hutchinson-Gilford 
progeria syndrome in which persons suffer from a premature aged appearance and 
in neotenic complex syndrome in which children appear to be "frozen in time," 
remaining physically and cognitively similar to an infant or toddler despite 
increasing age. Ideally, it would be desirable to slow down the aging process 
with the hope of looking younger longer and improving good health and longevity. 
Evidence that this is possible comes from data showing increases in average 
human life expectancy over the past century and recognition of the photoaging 
effects of sun exposure, with the development of protective strategies, 
including the routine use of clothing, hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen while 
avoiding the sun during its peak hours of 10 am to 4 pm. Other strategies for 
maintaining younger-looking skin include the adoption of a healthy lifestyle and 
use of antiaging skin preparations. Stem cell therapy may also play a role in 
aging therapy. Current research is clarifying the genetic basis of skin 
youthfulness and may help to direct future therapies to target key biologic 
pathways of aging.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most commonly diagnosed type of skin cancer. 
BCCs are especially prevalent in the elderly population, given their association 
with cumulative sun exposure and other risk factors. In this contribution, we 
outline geriatric concepts related to the care of older adults with BCCs. We 
describe how a patient's life expectancy can be estimated and combined with 
tumor characteristics to determine lag time to benefit, a concept to better 
understand whether patients will experience the efficacy of a treatment within 
their life span. We also review the possibility of current BCC overdiagnosis and 
summarize the effectiveness, benefits, and risks of common treatments for BCCs, 
noting that all treatment modalities have special considerations when 
administered to older adults. In particular, nonsurgical treatments might be 
preferable for older adults with a limited life expectancy. Ultimately, we argue 
that the decision of whether and how to treat a BCC should be the result of 
shared decision-making between the provider and the patient and take into 
account not only tumor characteristics, but also patient values and preferences.

Hypophysitis is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease, characterized 
by an elevated risk of complications, such as occurrence of acute central 
hypoadrenalism, persistent hypopituitarism, or extension of the inflammatory 
process to the neighboring neurological structures. In recent years, a large 
number of patients have been described as being affected by hypophysitis, due to 
the increased administration of immuno-chemotherapies. At the present time, the 
heterogeneous nature of hypophysitis diagnostic criteria and of the treatment 
protocols makes the management of affected patients difficult. We review the 
current data and evidence on primary and secondary hypophysitis, in order to 
suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol that should be focused on a 
multidisciplinary approach, for reaching a prompt diagnosis and an appropriate 
and safe treatment.

The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is characterized by a more than 
tenfold higher life expectancy compared to another rodent species of the same 
size, namely, the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus). We used mass spectrometric 
metabolomics to analyze circulating plasma metabolites in both species at 
different ages. Interspecies differences were much more pronounced than 
age-associated alterations in the metabolome. Such interspecies divergences 
affected multiple metabolic pathways involving amino, bile and fatty acids as 
well as monosaccharides and nucleotides. The most intriguing metabolites were 
those that had previously been linked to pro-health and antiaging effects in 
mice and that were significantly increased in the long-lived rodent compared to 
its short-lived counterpart. This pattern applies to α-tocopherol (also known as 
vitamin E) and polyamines (in particular cadaverine, N8-acetylspermidine and 
N1,N8-diacetylspermidine), all of which were more abundant in naked mole-rats 
than in mice. Moreover, the age-associated decline in spermidine and 
N1-acetylspermidine levels observed in mice did not occur, or is even reversed 
(in the case of N1-acetylspermidine) in naked mole-rats. In short, the present 
metabolomics analysis provides a series of testable hypotheses to explain the 
exceptional longevity of naked mole-rats.

Age Takes Hold of Us by Surprise: Conceptualizing Vulnerabilities in Aging as 
the Timing of Adverse Events.

Vanhoutte B(1).

Liverpool, UK.

OBJECTIVES: Aging in the public eye can be distilled to a limited number of 
adverse events, such as loss of health, partnership and wealth. While these 
events are a constitutive part of "normal aging," they do not occur uniformly at 
the same time point in the life course. This study investigates to what extent 
bereavement, functional health loss, and onset of poverty are adequate markers 
of aging, and illustrates inequalities in their timing according to cohort, 
gender, class, education, and ethnicity.
METHODS: The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), collected over seven 
waves (2002-2016) (n = 7,890) is examined in an event history framework. Cox 
proportional hazard models are used with the Andersen Gill extension in case of 
multiple failures per respondent.
RESULTS: Persistent associations of lower occupational class, lower education, 
and having a black or minority ethnic background are found with increased 
hazards of functional health loss and wealth loss. Earlier born cohorts have 
lower hazards for functional health loss, wealth loss, and bereavement. Women 
have higher hazards for bereavement, and lower hazards for wealth loss.
DISCUSSION: The timing of adverse events is a crucial gateway through which 
existing social inequalities are transferred into unequal aging pathways.

Striacosta albicosta (Smith) is a key pest of maize and dry beans in North 
America. It has expanded its distribution from the western Great Plains of the 
United States to the Great Lakes region in the United States and Canada. There 
has been limited research on the baseline biological aspects of this insect 
under controlled conditions. The objective of this study was to detail the 
biological parameters of S. albicosta feeding on an artificial diet under 
laboratory conditions. Overall survival from neonate to adult at 26.6 ± 1°C was 
36.72% and the total developmental time was approximately 110 d. Survival of the 
egg, larval, prepupal, and pupal stages were 75.71, 98.50, 51.78, and 95.10%, 
respectively. Average duration of the egg, larval, prepupal, and pupal stages 
was 4.64, 28.20, 41.50, and 25.91 d, respectively. During the larval stage, 
92.50% of larvae developed through seven instars and the remaining through six 
instars. Larvae that developed through six and seven instars exhibited a mean 
growth ratio of 1.60 and 1.47, respectively; however, there was no difference in 
pupal weight. Eggs laid by field-mated moths showed a fertility of 75.71%, 
compared with 4.18% from laboratory-reared moths. These data suggest that S. 
albicosta develop primarily through seven instars and the most vulnerable 
developmental stage is the prepupa. Laboratory conditions strongly affected 
fertility success. Information presented here greatly expands our understanding 
of S. albicosta biology, which can be used to improve the efficiency of 
laboratory bioassays and management techniques for this critical crop pest.

PURPOSE: To describe prescribing of medicines in primary care in the last year 
of life in patients with dementia.
METHOD: A retrospective cohort analysis in UK primary care using routinely 
collected data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Number of 
medications and potentially inappropriate medication prescribed one year prior 
to, and including death, was ascertained.
RESULTS: Dementia patients (n = 6923) aged 86.6 ± 7.3 years (mean ± SD) were 
prescribed 4.8 ± 4.0 drugs 1 year prior to death, increasing to 5.6 ± 4.0 
2 months prior, before falling to 4.9 ± 4.1 at death. One year prior to death, 
50% of patients were prescribed a potentially inappropriate medication, falling 
to 41% at death. Cardiovascular medications were the most common, with decreases 
in drug count only occurring in the last month prior to death. Prescriptions for 
gastrointestinal and central nervous system medication increased throughout the 
year, particularly laxatives/analgaesics, antidepressants and 
hypnotic/antipsychotics. Women (vs. men) and patients with Alzheimer's (vs. 
vascular dementia) were prescribed 4.7% (95% CI 2.3%-7%) and 14.6% (11.7-17.3%) 
fewer medications, respectively. Prescribing decreased with age and increased 
with additional comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Dementia patients are prescribed high levels of medication, many 
potentially inappropriate, during their last year of life, with reductions 
occurring relatively late. Improvements to medication optimisation guidelines 
are needed to inform decision-making around deprescribing of long-term 
medications in patients with limited life-expectancy.

Down syndrome (DS) is a multisystem disorder affecting 1 in 800 births 
worldwide. Advancing technology, medical treatment, and social intervention have 
dramatically increased life expectancy, yet there are many etiologies of this 
disorder that are in need of further research. The advent of the ability to 
capture extracellular vesicles (EVs) in blood from specific cell types allows 
for the investigation of novel intracellular processes. Exosomes are one type of 
EVs that have demonstrated great potential in uncovering new biomarkers of 
neurodegeneration and disease, and also that appear to be intricately involved 
in the transsynaptic spread of pathogenic factors underlying Alzheimer's disease 
and other neurological diseases. Exosomes are nanosized vesicles, generated in 
endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and secreted by most cells in the body. 
Since exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication and 
genetic exchange, they have emerged as a major research focus and have revealed 
novel biological sequelae involved in conditions afflicting the DS population. 
This review summarizes current knowledge on exosome biology in individuals with 
DS, both early in life and in aging individuals. Collectively these studies have 
demonstrated that complex multicellular processes underlying DS etiologies may 
include abnormal formation and secretion of extracellular vesicles such as 
exosomes.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: In this study, we compared two research consent techniques: a 
standardized video plus usual consent and usual consent alone.
METHODS: Individuals who completed 24-month outcomes (completers) in the 
Operations and Pelvic Muscle Training in the Management of Apical Support Loss 
study were invited to participate in an extended, longitudinal follow-up study 
(extended Operations and Pelvic Muscle Training in the Management of Apical 
Support Loss). Potential participants who were (1) able to provide consent and 
(2) not in long-term care facilities were randomized 1:1 to a standardized video 
detailing the importance of long-term follow-up studies of pelvic floor 
disorders followed by the usual institutional consent process versus the usual 
consent process alone. Randomization, stratified by site, used randomly permuted 
blocks. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who enrolled in 
the extended study and completed data collection events 5 years after surgery. 
Secondary outcomes included the proportion enrolled in the extended study, 
completion of follow-up at each study year, completion of data collection 
points, completion of in-person visits, and completion of quality of life calls. 
Motivation and barriers to enrollment (study-level and personal-level) and 
satisfaction with the study consent process were measured by questionnaire prior 
to recruitment into extended Operations and Pelvic Muscle Training in the 
Management of Apical Support Loss. Groups were compared using an 
intention-to-treat principle, using unadjusted Student's t-test (continuous) and 
chi-square or Fisher's exact (categorical) test. A sample size of 340 
(170/group) was estimated to detect a 15% difference in enrollment and study 
completion between groups with p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Of the 327 Operations and Pelvic Muscle Training in the Management of 
Apical Support Loss completers, 305 were randomized to the consent process study 
(153 video vs 152 no video). Groups were similar in demographics, surgical 
treatment, and outcomes. The overall rate of extended study enrollment was high, 
without significant differences between groups (video 92.8% vs no video 94.1%, 
p = 0.65). There were no significant differences in the primary outcome (video 
79.1% vs no video 75.7%, p = 0.47) or in any secondary outcomes. Being "very 
satisfied" overall with study information (97.7% vs 88.5%, p = 0.01); "strong 
agreement" for feeling informed about the study (81.3% vs 70.8%, p = 0.06), 
understanding the study purpose (83.6% vs 71.0%, p = 0.02), nature and extent 
(82.8% vs 70.2%, p = 0.02), and potential societal benefits (82.8% vs 67.9%, 
p = 0.01); and research coordinator/study nurse relationship being "very 
important" (72.7% vs 63.4%, p = 0.03) were better in the video compared to the 
no video consent group.
CONCLUSION: The extended study had high enrollment; most participants completed 
most study tasks during the 3-year observational extension, regardless of the 
use of video to augment research consent. The video was associated with a higher 
proportion of participants reporting improved study understanding and 
relationship with study personnel.

Background: The number of patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation 
(PMV) or maintenance dialysis (MD) is increasing worldwide. Identification of 
those with a short life expectancy is useful for early referral of palliative 
care. Objective: To determine the survival rate, life expectancy, and major 
prognostic factors in patients under both PMV and MD. Design: We extracted a 
1:3.4 random sample of patients treated with mechanical ventilation (MV) from 
the National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database of Taiwan from 2003 to 
2007. Subjects who had undergone MD and received MV for longer than 21 days were 
enrolled. Setting/Subjects: There were 1035 patients who received both PMV and 
MD. Measurements: The survival rates and life expectancy were estimated. A 
multivariate proportional hazards model was constructed to validate the effects 
of different prognostic factors, including age, gender, hospital size, and major 
comorbidities. Results: The median length of survival of patients under both PMV 
and MD was 54 days. The three-month, six-month, and one-year survival rates were 
40.8%, 24.1%, and 12.6%, respectively. The life expectancies of those older than 
70 years were five months; those comorbid with cancer and septicemia were 112 
and 90 days, respectively. After adjustments for covariates, we found following 
prognostic factors were statistically significant: gangrene, peritonitis, liver 
cirrhosis, cancer, septicemia, hydrocephalus, having device complications, and 
shock. Conclusions: More than 85% of patients receiving both PMV and MD died 
within one year. Communication and early referral for palliative care would be 
indicated for those comorbid with significant prognostic factors.

There is a need for formal cost-effectiveness evidence to better model the 
real-world payer decision context in which general economic models are currently 
being used, specifically regarding clinical genomics health services (for 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests). We reviewed literature focused on 
cost-effectiveness studies after completion of the Human Genome Project within 
the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry and found that only 33% of 
eligible studies were conducted from the U.S. payer perspective. Additional 
interpretation challenges include economic models that do not account for true 
payer-negotiated costs, limits in internal expertise for quality-adjusted 
life-year inferences, and limited internal policies to use CEA research in 
decision making. This Viewpoints article highlights numerous opportunities to 
increase the translational effect of economic modeling work. Specifically, 
geographically relevant cost and outcomes data should be considered for 
integration within best practices for economic evaluations of NGS tests. Such 
data integration may provide more informed decision making regarding the 
allocation of constrained resources for health care services and technology.
