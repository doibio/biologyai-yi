that it was ≤£30,000. With the 'complete case data' the probabilities were 80% 
and 90% respectively.
CONCLUSION: This pragmatic randomised trial involving one of the oldest 
populations subjected to a cost-utility analysis, suggests that use of oral 
nutritional supplements in care homes are cost-effective relative to dietary 
advice.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of quadripolar versus bipolar cardiac resynchronization defibrillator therapy 
systems.
BACKGROUND: Quadripolar left ventricular (LV) leads for cardiac 
resynchronization therapy reduce phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and are 
associated with reduced mortality compared with bipolar leads.
METHODS: A total of 606 patients received implants at 3 UK centers (319 Q, 287 
B), between 2009 and 2014; mean follow-up was 879 days. Rehospitalization 
episodes were costed at National Health Service national tariff rates, and EQ-5D 
utility values were applied to heart failure admissions, acute coronary syndrome 
events, and mortality data, which were used to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-year differences over 5 years.
RESULTS: Groups were matched with regard to age and sex. Patients with 
quadripolar implants had a lower rate of hospitalization than those with bipolar 
implants (42.6% vs. 55.4%; p = 0.002). This was primarily driven by fewer 
hospital readmissions for heart failure (51 [16%] vs. 75 [26.1%], respectively, 
for quadripolar vs. bipolar implants; p = 0.003) and generator replacements (9 
[2.8%] vs. 19 [6.6%], respectively; p = 0.03). Hospitalization for suspected 
acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, device explantation, and lead revisions 
were similar. This lower health-care utilization cost translated into a 
cumulative 5-year cost saving for patients with quadripolar systems where the 
acquisition cost was <£932 (US $1,398) compared with bipolar systems. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results mirrored the deterministic 
calculations. For the average additional price of £1,200 (US $1,800) over a 
bipolar system, the incremental cost-effective ratio was £3,692 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained (US $5,538), far below the usual 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 (US $30,000).
CONCLUSIONS: In a UK health-care 5-year time horizon, the additional purchase 
price of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization defibrillator therapy systems is 
largely offset by lower subsequent event costs up to 5 years after implantation, 
which makes this technology highly cost-effective compared with bipolar systems.

INTRODUCTION: Case control studies suggest an inverse association between 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and Crohn's disease (CD). It is possible this 
could be accounted for by confounders such as antibiotic therapy. Analyzing the 
geographic distribution of H. pylori and the links with the incidence and 
prevalence of CD would be an alternative approach to circumvent these 
confounders.
METHODS: The literature was searched for studies published between 1990 and 2016 
that reported incidence or prevalence data for CD in random population samples 
in developed countries (GDP per capita >20,000 USD/year). Corresponding 
prevalence studies for H. pylori in these same regions were then sought matched 
to the same time period (±6 years). The association between the incidence and 
prevalence of CD and H. pylori prevalence rates were assessed before and after 
adjusting for GDP and life expectancy.
RESULTS: A total of 19 CD prevalence and 22 CD incidence studies from 10 
European countries, Japan, USA, and Australia with date-matched H. pylori 
prevalence data were identified. The mean H. pylori prevalence rate was 43.4% 
(range 15.5-85%), and the mean rates for incidence and prevalence for CD were 
6.9 and 91.0/100,000 respectively. The incidence (r = -0.469, p < 0.03) and 
prevalence (r = -0.527, p = 0.02) of CD was inversely and significantly 
associated with prevalence of H. pylori infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a significant inverse association between 
geographic distribution of H. pylori and CD. Thus, it is highly unlikely that 
the findings of previous case control studies were simply due to confounding 
factors such as concomitant antibiotic use in CD patients.

We examine several methodological considerations when eliciting probabilistic 
expectations in a developing country context using the Longitudinal Ageing Study 
in India (LASI). We conclude that although, on average, individuals are able to 
understand the concept of probability, responses are sensitive to framing 
effects and to own versus hypothetical-person effects. We find that overall, 
people are pessimistic about their survival probabilities compared with 
state-specific life tables and that socioeconomic status does influence beliefs 
about own survival expectations as found in previous literature in other 
countries. Higher levels of education and income have a positive association 
with survival expectations, and these associations persist even when 
conditioning on self-reported health. The results remain robust to several 
alternative specifications. We then compare the survival measures with objective 
measures of health. We find that activities of daily life, height, and low 
hemoglobin levels covary with subjective expectations in expected directions.

Mixed modes of reproduction, combining sexual processes with thelytokous 
parthenogenesis, occur in all major clades of social insects. In several species 
of termites, queens maximize their genetic input into nondispersing replacement 
queens through parthenogenesis, while maintaining genetically diverse sterile 
offspring and dispersing reproductives via sexual reproduction. This so-called 
asexual queen succession (AQS) has multiple independent origins and its presumed 
advantages are diverse as well, ranging from multiplication of colony 
reproductive potential to extension of its lifespan beyond that of the 
foundress. However, how AQS shapes colony life cycles under natural conditions 
remains poorly known. The neotropical termite Silvestritermes minutus inhabits 
small but conspicuous nests, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the 
impact of AQS on life history. We report on its breeding system, life cycle and 
sex allocation using social structure census in 137 nests and genotyping of 12 
colonies at 12 microsatellite loci. We show that colonies are established by an 
outbred pair of primary reproductives. In less than 2 years, the foundress is 
replaced by multiple neotenic queens, arising mostly through automixis with 
central fusion. Sterile castes, male and most (93%) female dispersers are 
produced sexually. Colony reproduction is usually restricted to a single 
dispersal of alates with unbiased sex ratio, taking place after 3 years. We 
conclude that S. minutus benefits from AQS to maximize colony growth rate and 
alate production within a very short life cycle rather than to extend colony 
lifespan. This highlights the versatile role of AQS in different cases of its 
polyphyletic origin.

In an effort to improve health service delivery and achieve better health 
outcomes, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for improved efficiency 
of health care systems to better use the available funding. This study aims to 
examine the efficiency of national health systems using longitudinal 
country-level data. Data on health spending per capita, infant mortality rate 
(IMR), under 5 mortality rate (U5MR), and life expectancy (LE) were collected 
from or imputed for 173 countries from 2004 through 2011. Data envelopment 
analyses were used to evaluate the efficiency and regression models were 
constructed to examine the determinants of efficiency. The average efficiency of 
the national health system, when examined yearly, was 78.9%, indicating a 
potential saving of 21.1% of health spending per capita to achieve the same 
level of health status for children and the entire population, if all countries 
performed as well as their peers. Additionally, the efficiency of the national 
health system varied widely among countries. On average, Africa had the lowest 
efficiency of 67%, while West Pacific countries had the highest efficiency of 
86%. National economic status, HIV/AIDS prevalence, health financing mechanisms 
and governance were found to be statistically associated with the efficiency of 
national health systems. Taking health financing as an example, a 1% point 
increase of social security expenses as a percentage of total health expenditure 
correlated to a 1.9% increase in national health system efficiency. The study 
underscores the need to enhance efficiency of national health systems to meet 
population health needs, and highlights the importance of health financing and 
governance in improving the efficiency of health systems, to ultimately improve 
health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart 
disease (CHD) and stroke are expected to increase in Latin America. Moderate and 
regular alcohol consumption confers cardiovascular protection, while binge 
drinking increases risk. We estimated the effects of alcohol use on the number 
of annual CHD and stroke deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 
Argentina.
METHODS: Alcohol use data were obtained from a nationally representative survey 
(EnPreCosp 2011), and etiological effect sizes from meta-analyses of 
epidemiological studies. Cause-specific mortality rates were from the vital 
registration system.
RESULTS: There were 291,475 deaths in 2010 including 24,893 deaths from CHD and 
15,717 from stroke. 62.7% of men and 38.7% of women reported drinking alcohol in 
the past year. All heavy drinkers (i.e. women who drank >20g/day and men who 
drank >40g/day of alcohol) met the definition of binge drinking and therefore 
did not benefit from cardioprotective effects. Alcohol drinking prevented 1,424 
CHD deaths per year but caused 935 deaths from stroke (121 ischemic and 814 
hemorrhagic), leading to 448 CVD deaths prevented (58.3% in men). Alcohol use 
was estimated to save 85,772 DALYs from CHD, but was responsible for 52,171 lost 
from stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: In Argentina, the cardioprotective effect of regular and moderate 
alcohol drinking is slightly larger than the harmful impact of binge drinking on 
CVD. However, considering global deleterious effects of alcohol in public 
health, policies to reduce binge drinking should be enforced, especially for 
young people. Studies are still needed to elucidate effects on cardiovascular 
health.

2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is widely dispersed endocrine 
disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic ecosystem. Due to its devastating 
effect on marine organisms and insufficient database on toxicology, we 
investigated the adverse effects of BDE-47 on life parameters and antioxidant 
defense system following the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the 
monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus. In B. koreanus, the reduction in life 
cycle, fecundity, and population growth were observed in response to BDE-47. 
50μg/L BDE-47 significantly reduced (P<0.05) life expectancy and net 
reproductive rate. In response to 10-50μg/L BDE-47 exposure, the oxidative 
stress was elicited via the generation of ROS, while the antioxidant related 
enzymes (e.g. glutathione S-transferase [GST] and glutathione reductase [GR]) 
have demonstrated significant activity levels (P<0.05) to further alleviate the 
oxidative stress in a concentration dependent manner. Furthermore, transcript 
profiles of antioxidant function (GST-A, -O, and -S1-S8)-related genes have 
shown the significant increase over 24h in response to BDE-47 (0, 10, 25, and 
50μg/L). As for MAPK signaling pathway analysis, up-regulation of their 
activities was observed at 25μg/L BDE-47 but their activities have reduced at 
adult NOEC concentration of 50μg/L. This study provides a better understanding 
of the effects of BDE-47 on life parameters, molecular defense system, and 
activation of MAPK signaling pathway against generated oxidants in the rotifer.

BACKGROUND: Research has shown that the distance to the nearest immunization 
location can ultimately prevent someone from getting immunized. With the 
introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine throughout the world, a major 
question is whether the target populations can readily access immunization.
METHODS: In anticipation of HPV vaccine introduction in Mozambique, a country 
with a 2015 population of 25,727,911, our team developed Strategic Integrated 
Geo-temporal Mapping Application) to determine the potential economic impact of 
HPV immunization. We quantified how many people in the target population are 
reachable by the 1377 existing immunization locations, how many cannot access 
these locations, and the potential costs and disease burden averted by 
immunization.
RESULTS: If the entire 2015 cohort of 10-year-old girls goes without HPV 
immunization, approximately 125 (111-139) new cases of HPV 16,18-related 
cervical cancer are expected in the future. If each health center covers a 
catchment area with a 5-km radius (ie, if people travel up to 5 km to obtain 
vaccines), then 40% of the target population could be reached to prevent 50 
(44-55) cases, 178 (159-198) disability-adjusted life years, and US $202,854 (US 
$140,758-323,693) in health care costs and lost productivity. At higher 
catchment area radii, additional increases in catchment area radius raise 
population coverage with diminishing returns.
CONCLUSIONS: Much of the population in Mozambique is unable to reach any 
existing immunization location, thereby reducing the potential impact of HPV 
vaccine. The geospatial information system analysis can assist in planning 
vaccine introduction strategies to maximize access and help the population reap 
the maximum benefits from an immunization program.

of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the lifetime risk of human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) diagnosis among US men who have sex with men (MSM), trends in risk 
and how risk varies between populations.
METHODS: We used census and HIV surveillance data to construct life tables to 
estimate the cumulative risk of HIV diagnosis among cohorts of MSM born 1940 to 
1994 in King County, Washington (KC) and Mississippi (MS).
RESULTS: The cumulative risk of HIV diagnosis progressed in 3 phases. In phase 
1, risk increased among MSM in successive cohorts born 1940 to 1964. Among men 
born 1955 to 1965 (the peak risk cohort), by age 55 years, 45% of white KC MSM, 
65% of black KC MSM, 22% of white MS MSM, and 51% of black MS MSM had been 
diagnosed with HIV. In phase 2, men born 1965 to 1984, risk of diagnosis among 
KC MSM declined almost 60% relative to the peak risk cohort. A similar pattern 
of decline occurred in white MS MSM, with a somewhat smaller decline observed in 
black MS MSM. In phase 3, men born 1985 to 1994, the pattern of risk diverged. 
Among white KC MSM, black KC MSM, and white MS MSM, HIV risk increased slightly 
compared with men born 1975 to 1984, with 6%, 14%, and 2% diagnosed by age 27 
years, respectively. Among black MS MSM born 1985 to 1994, HIV risk rose 
dramatically, with 35% HIV diagnosed by age 27 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime risk of HIV diagnosis has substantially declined among 
MSM in KC and among white MSM in MS, but is rising dramatically among black MSM 
in MS.

Personalized medicine is a set of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic 
approaches in which medical interventions are carried out based on individual 
patient characteristics. As life expectancy increases in developed and 
developing countries, the incidence of diseases such as cancer goes up among 
people in the community. Cancer is a disease that the response to treatment 
varies from one person to another and also it is costly for individuals, 
families, and society. Among thyroid cancers, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) 
is the most aggressive, lethal and unresponsive form of the disease. 
Unfortunately, current drugs are not targetable, and therefore they have 
restricted role in ATC treatment. Consequently, mortality of this cancer, 
despite advances in the field of diagnosis and treatment, is one of the most 
important challenges in medicine. Cellular, molecular and genetic evidences play 
an important role in finding more effective diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches. Review of these evidences confirms the application of personalized 
medicine in cancer treatment including ATC. A growing body of evidence has 
elucidated that cellular and molecular mechanisms of cancer would pave the way 
for defining new biomarkers for targeted therapy, taking into account individual 
differences. It should be noted that this approach requires further progress in 
the fields of basic sciences, pharmacogenetics and drug design. An overview of 
the most important aspects in individualized anaplastic thyroid cancer treatment 
will be discussed in this review.

Relief of knee flexion contracture and gait improvement following adaptive 
training for an assist device in a transtibial amputee: A case study.

Kim SB, Ko CY, Son J, Kang S, Ryu J, Mun M.

BACKGROUND: Management of a knee contracture is important for regaining gait 
ability in transtibial amputees. However, there has been little study of 
prosthesis training for enhancing mobility and improving range of motion in 
cases of restricted knee extension.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of adaptive training for an 
assist device (ATAD) for a transtibial amputee with a knee flexion contracture 
(KFC). A male transtibial amputee with KFC performed 4 months of ATAD with a 
multidisciplinary team. During the ATAD, the passive range of motion (PROM) in 
the knee, amputee mobility predictor (AMP) assessment, center of pressure (COP) 
on a force plate-equipped treadmill, gait features determined by 
three-dimensional motion analysis, and Short-Form 36 Item Health Survey (SF-36) 
scores were evaluated.
RESULTS: Following ATAD, PROM showed immediate improvement (135.6 ± 2.4° at 
baseline, 142.5 ± 1.7° at Step 1, 152.1 ± 1.8° at Step 2, 165.8 ± 1.9° at Step 
3, and 166.0 ± 1.4° at Step 4); this was followed by an enhanced COP. Gradually, 
gait features also improved. Additionally, the AMP score (5 at baseline to 29 at 
Step 4) and K-level (K0 at baseline to K3 at Step 4) increased after ATAD. Along 
with these improvements, the SF-36 score also improved.
CONCLUSIONS: ATAD could be beneficial for transtibial amputees by relieving knee 
contractures and improving gait.

This work aims to evaluate the impact of the chemical composition of 
groundwater/drinking water on the health of inhabitants of the Slovak Republic. 
Primary data consists of 20,339 chemical analyses of groundwater (34 chemical 
elements and compounds) and data on the health of the Slovak population 
expressed in the form of health indicators (HI). Fourteen HIs were evaluated 
including life expectancy, potential years of lost life, relative/standardized 
mortality for cardiovascular and oncological diseases, and diseases of the 
gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. The chemical and health data were 
expressed as the mean values for each of the 2883 Slovak municipalities. 
Artificial neural network (ANN) was the method used for environmental and health 
data analysis. The most significant relationship between HI and chemical 
composition of groundwater was documented as Ca + Mg (mmol·L-1), Ca and Mg. The 
following limit values were set for these most significant groundwater chemical 
parameters: Ca + Mg 2.9-6.1 mmol·L-1, Ca 78-155 mg·L-1 and Mg 28-54 mg·L-1. At 
these concentration ranges, the health of the Slovak population is the most 
favorable and the life expectancy is the highest. These limit values are about 
twice as high in comparison to the current Slovak valid guideline values for 
drinking water.

Whooping cough is a vaccine-preventable infectious diseases caused by Bordetella 
pertussis/parapertussis. Despite of routine immunization programs in the world, 
pertussis still remains endemic. Recently unvaccinated or partially immunized 
infants have infected with this pathogen and also increase of incidence was 
observed in adolescents and adults. The source of pertussis in newborns are 
attributed to household, especially due to the family members. Theaim of this 
study was to determine B.pertussis IgG antibody positivity by ELISA method in 
adults. Eighty-four of the total study population (39.6%) were anti-pertussis 
IgG positive, 128 (60.4%) were negative. The samples included in the study (n= 
212) were divided into three groups according to ages: 19-35 years (Group 1, n= 
61), 36-50 years (Group 2, n= 58), 51-65 years (Group 3, n= 93). Anti-pertussis 
IgG antibody positivity was 26.2% (n= 22) in Group 1, 26.2% (n= 22) in Group 2 
and 47.6% (n= 40) in Group 3. According to the anti-pertussis IgG positivity 
results, no significant difference was observed between genders. The results 
were obtained as absorbance values by ELISA test, then transformed into 
semi-quantitative values as NovaTec Test Unit (NTU). NTU positive values were 
between 11.01-39.4. Ninety four percent of NTU values were in the range of 11.01 
to 28.01 and 6% were between 28.01 to 39.4. It was observed that seropositivity 
rates peaked at ages of 27, 55 and 65. The highest NTU values were observed in 
the age of 32 in females and in the age of 24 in males. Relatively, low 
seropositivity values (NT= 15-20) were observed in both females and males to the 
age of 45 in Group 2. However a slight increase was observed in females after 
the age of 45. An increase (NTU ≥ 20) was determined in the age of 49 in males. 
The seropositivity rates were generally low (NT ≤ 20) in females in Group 3, but 
the highest values (NTU ≥ 30) were observed in 55 and 65 years of age in males 
in this group. The highest seropositivity (NTI ≥ 30) were in 55 and 65 years of 
age (NTI ≥ 30) in males and 27 years of age (NTU ≥ 30) in females while in 36-50 
age range, it was relatively low (NTI ≤ 20). Routine pertussis vaccination 
program is not yet implemented for adults in our country. However, the causes 
more clearly demonstrate the need for adult pertussis vaccination since adults 
may be incompletely vaccinated or not vaccinated in the childhood, current 
vaccinations are not available in the childhood of adults, adults become more 
susceptible to infections as the age increases, life expectancy increases and 
the likelihood of encountering infections, and childhood vaccination antibodies 
diminish over time. According to the results of this study, a single dose of 
pertussis vaccine is recommended to implement for adults in our country.

BACKGROUND: Prior calculations of the burden of disease from environmental lead 
exposure in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not included estimates 
of the burden from lead-contaminated sites because of a lack of exposure data, 
resulting in an underestimation of a serious public health problem.
OBJECTIVE: We used publicly available statistics and detailed site assessment 
data to model the number of informal used lead-acid battery (ULAB) recyclers and 
the resulting exposures in 90 LMICs. We estimated blood lead levels (BLLs) using 
the US Environment Protection Agency's Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic 
Model for Lead in Children and Adult Lead Model. Finally, we used data and 
algorithms generated by the World Health Organization to calculate the number of 
attributable disability adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: We estimated that there are 10,599 to 29,241 informal ULAB processing 
sites where human health is at risk in the 90 countries we reviewed. We further 
estimated that 6 to 16.8 million people are exposed at these sites and calculate 
a geometric mean BLL for exposed children (0-4 years of age) of 31.15 μg/dL and 
a geometric mean BLL for adults of 21.2 μg/dL. We calculated that these 
exposures resulted in 127,248 to 1,612,476 DALYs in 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: Informal ULAB processing is currently causing widespread lead 
poisoning in LMICs. There is an urgent need to identify and mitigate exposures 
at existing sites and to develop appropriate policy responses to minimize the 
creation of new sites.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in women and the 
third most common cancer among men, and its incidence is increasing in Asia. 
Awareness about the status of this cancer incidence and mortality is necessary 
for a better plan.
OBJECTIVES: The present study was done with the aim to investigate the incidence 
and mortality of colorectal cancer and its relationship with the Human 
Development Index (HDI) in Asia in 2012.
METHODS: This study was an ecological study, which was conducted based on the 
GLOBOCAN project of the World Health Organization for Asian countries. We 
assessed the correlation between standardized incidence rates (SIR) and 
standardized mortality rates (SMR) of colorectal cancer with HDI and its 
components using SPSS software, version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
RESULTS: A total of 592,563 incidences of and 325,752 deaths from colorectal 
cancer were recorded in Asian countries in 2012. The 5 countries with the 
highest SIR were Republic of Korea (45 per 100,000), Israel (35.9 per 100,000), 
Singapore (33.7 per 100,000), Japan (32.2 per 100,000), and Jordan (25.6 per 
100,000). The 5 countries with the highest SMR for colorectal cancer were Jordan 
(15.5 per 100,000), Kazakhstan (12.8 per 100,000), Democratic Republic of Korea 
(12 per 100,000), Brunei (12 per 100,000), and Japan (11.9 per 100,000). 
Correlation between HDI and SIR was 0.709 overall (P ≤ .001)- 0.667 in men (P ≤ 
.001) and 0.759 in women (P ≤ .001). Also, correlation between HDI and SMR 
overall was 0.517 (P ≤ .001)- 0.447 in men (P = .002) and 0.593 in women (P ≤ 
.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer incidence and mortality are higher in countries with more 
development. A positive and statistically significant correlation was found 
between standardized incidence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer and the 
Human Development Index and its components.

A novel chitosan-based coating solution was prepared by combining glycerol 
monolaurate (GML) for shelf life extension of refrigerated grass carp fillets. 
The control and coated fillets were analyzed periodically for physicochemical 
(pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) 
value, K value, and shear force), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC), 
psychrophilic bacteria counts (PTC), Pseudomonads and H2S-producing bacteria) 
and sensorial characteristics. The results showed that chitosan-GML coated 
samples presented better quality preservation effects than chitosan coating 
alone. In addition, 2% chitosan enriched with 0.3% GML showed the significant 
(P<0.05) effectiveness in inhibiting microbial growth, nucleotide breakdown, the 
formation of alkaline components and texture deterioration, and maintaining 
sensory acceptability among the groups. These findings confirmed that chitosan 
coating enriched with GML was a promising method to extend the shelf life of 
refrigerated fillets.

OBJECTIVES: Our study examined how life years spent in multimorbidity changed 
over a period of 10 years (2005-2014) and whether morbidity expansion or 
compression has taken place. There is a little evidence on whether life years 
gained due to increasing life expectancy are spent in good health, or if they 
are accompanied by morbidity expansion.
METHODS: The analyses are based on German administrative claims data. 
Multimorbidity was defined as a combination of at least six chronic conditions 
and polypharmacy. After having estimated age-standardized prevalence, time 
trends for life years with and without multimorbidity, and the proportion of 
life years spent in multimorbidity (morbidity ratio) were estimated.
RESULTS: Prevalence proportions of multimorbidity rose continuously. Increasing 
life expectancies were accompanied by increasing life years with multimorbidity, 
decreasing multimorbidity-free life years, and by an increasing morbidity ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: The lifespan spent in multimorbidity was increasing over time. Our 
findings indicate a growing burden of multimorbidity and an increasing 
proportion of life years with multiple chronic conditions. It can be concluded 
that an expansion of morbidity in absolute and in relative terms has occurred. 
The findings stress the importance of prevention, healthy lifestyles, and 
improved medical care strategies meeting the specific requirements of patients 
with multimorbidity.

Abnormal liver enzymes (LE) are common in patients infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) even in the absence of viral hepatitis or alcohol 
abuse. With availability of antiretroviral combination therapy, life expectancy 
has improved dramatically and as a consequence the spectrum of liver disease is 
changing. Increased reports on the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in HIV coinfected 
patients raise questions around prevalence, clinical manifestations, and 
clinical outcome of these liver diseases in HIV coinfection. Moreover, the 
potential impact of combination antiretroviral therapy as well as direct HIV 
effects on the emergence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease needs to be 
explored. This review summarizes the recent literature on NAFLD and NASH in HIV.

The objective was to determine the relationships between early-life parameters 
[including average daily gain (ADG), body weight (BW), milk replacer intake, 
starter intake, and birth season] and the first-lactation performance of 
Holstein cows. We collected data from birth years 2004 to 2012 for 2,880 
Holstein animals. Calves were received from 3 commercial dairy farms and 
enrolled in 37 different calf research trials at the University of Minnesota 
Southern Research and Outreach Center from 3 to 195 d. Upon trial completion, 
calves were returned to their respective farms. Milk replacer options included 
varying protein levels and amounts fed, but in the majority of studies, calves 
were fed a milk replacer containing 20% crude protein and 20% fat at 0.57 
kg/calf daily. Most calves (93%) were weaned at 6 wk. Milk replacer dry matter 
intake, starter intake, ADG, and BW at 6 wk were 21.5 ± 2.2 kg, 17.3 ± 7.3 kg, 
0.53 ± 0.13 kg/d, and 62.4 ± 6.8 kg, respectively. Average age at first calving 
and first-lactation 305-d milk yield were 715 ± 46.5 d and 10,959 ± 1,527 kg, 
respectively. We conducted separate mixed-model analyses using the REML 
model-fitting protocol of JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine the 
effect of early-life BW or ADG, milk replacer and starter intake, and birth 
season on first-lactation 305-d milk, fat, and true protein yield. Greater BW 
and ADG at 6 wk resulted in increased first-lactation milk and milk component 
yields. Intake of calf starter at 8 wk had a significant positive relationship 
with first-lactation 305-d yield of milk and milk components. Milk replacer 
intake, which varied very little in this data set, had no effect on 
first-lactation 305-d yield of milk and milk components. Calves born in the fall 
and winter had greater starter intake, BW, and ADG at 8 wk. However, calves born 
in the summer had a higher 305-d milk yield during their first lactation than 
those born in the fall and winter. Improvements were modest, and variation was 
high, suggesting that additional factors not accounted for in these analyses 
affected first-lactation performance.

Recent studies indicate that the immune system adaptation during pregnancy could 
play a significant role in the pathophysiology of perinatal depression. The aim 
of this study was to investigate if inflammation markers in a late pregnancy 
plasma sample can predict the presence of depressive symptoms at eight weeks 
postpartum. Blood samples from 291 pregnant women (median and IQR for days to 
delivery, 13 and 7-23days respectively) comprising 63 individuals with 
postpartum depressive symptoms, as assessed by the Edinburgh postnatal 
depression scale (EPDS≥12) and/or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview (M.I.N.I.) and 228 controls were analyzed with an inflammation protein 
panel using multiplex proximity extension assay technology, comprising of 92 
inflammation-associated markers. A summary inflammation variable was also 
calculated. Logistic regression, LASSO and Elastic net analyses were 
implemented. Forty markers were lower in late pregnancy among women with 
depressive symptoms postpartum. The difference remained statistically 
significant for STAM-BP (or otherwise AMSH), AXIN-1, ADA, ST1A1 and IL-10, after 
Bonferroni correction. The summary inflammation variable was ranked as the 
second best variable, following personal history of depression, in predicting 
depressive symptoms postpartum. The protein-level findings for STAM-BP and ST1A1 
were validated in relation to methylation status of loci in the respective genes 
in a different population, using openly available data. This explorative 
approach revealed differences in late pregnancy levels of inflammation markers 
between women presenting with depressive symptoms postpartum and controls, 
previously not described in the literature. Despite the fact that the results do 
not support the use of a single inflammation marker in late pregnancy for 
assessing risk of postpartum depression, the use of STAM-BP or the novel notion 
of a summary inflammation variable developed in this work might be used in 
combination with other biological markers in the future.
