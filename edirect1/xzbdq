evidente tras una cirugía restrictiva que tras una malabsortiva. Los cambios 
metabólicos son mayores después de una cirugía malabsortiva o mixta que tras una 
cirugía puramente restrictiva, y esto se ha atribuido a una mayor pérdida de 
peso. Estudios que comparan los dos tipos de cirugía indican que, para la mismo 
índice de pérdida de peso, la disminución de colesterol es mayor con las 
primeras técnicas que con las últimas, y esta diferencia se debe principalmente 
a una mayor reducción de la absorción intestinal del colesterol. En la elección 
de la cirugía para un paciente concreto, entre otros aspectos, la cirugía de 
malabsorción parece estar más indicada en sujetos con hiperlipemia, 
especialmente con altos niveles de colesterol.

An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to control Campylobacter 
in the New Zealand poultry supply examined a series of interventions. 
Effectiveness was evaluated in terms of reduced health burden measured by 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Costs of implementation were estimated 
from the value of cost elements, determined by discussions with industry. 
Benefits were estimated by changing the inputs to a poultry food chain 
quantitative risk model. Proportional reductions in the number of predicted 
Campylobacter infections were converted into reductions in the burden of disease 
measured in DALYs. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for each 
intervention, as cost per DALY reduction and the ratios compared. The results 
suggest that the most cost-effective interventions (lowest ratios) are at the 
primary processing stage. Potential phage-based controls in broiler houses were 
also highly cost-effective. This study is limited by the ability to quantify 
costs of implementation and assumptions required to estimate health benefits, 
but it supports the implementation of interventions at the primary processing 
stage as providing the greatest quantum of benefit and lowest cost-effectiveness 
ratios.

The effect of healing touch on the pain and mobility of persons with 
osteoarthritis: a feasibility study.

The aims of this pilot study were to investigate the effects of Healing Touch 
(HT) on the pain level, joint function, mobility, and depression in persons with 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint(s). A randomized controlled trial using a 
repeated measures design was used. Cognitively intact persons (institutionalized 
and community) with a diagnosis of OA of the knee joint(s) received either HT 
sessions three times per week for 6 weeks (n = 12) or weekly friendly visits 
(FV) (n = 7). The HT sessions were delivered by a team of two nurses certified 
as HT practitioners and the FV was conducted by a nurse. All subjects continued 
to receive their standard care including the methods they had been using to 
relieve their joint pain. The two groups were similar regarding demographic 
variables, number of knees affected, co-morbidities, pain medications used and 
outcome variables at baseline. Two pain outcome measures (intensity and life 
interference) produced significant interaction effects. Two joint outcome 
measures (extension and extensor lag) also produced significant interaction 
effects. Furthermore, the HT group demonstrated significant improvements in 9 of 
the 12 outcome variables (75%) while no significant improvements occurred in the 
FV group. The HT group exhibited sustained effects (3 weeks post treatments) in 
three outcome variables. The reduction in joint pain and improvement in joint 
function suggest that biofield therapies could be effective non-pharmacological 
adjuncts to treatment of OA.

BACKGROUND: Although physiotherapists have long advocated workplace health, 
school teachers have not traditionally been a focus of study by these 
professionals. However, classroom teaching contributes to a range of 
occupational health issues related to general health as well as ergonomics that 
can be prevented or addressed by physiotherapists.
OBJECTIVES: To undertake a pilot study to explore the potential effects of a 
physiotherapy-directed occupational health programme individualised for school 
teachers, develop study methodology and gather preliminary data to establish a 
'proof of concept' to inform future studies.
DESIGN: Cluster randomised pilot study using a convenience sample.
SETTING: Eight Austrian regional secondary schools.
PARTICIPANTS: Schools and their teachers were recruited and allocated to an 
intervention group (IG, n=26 teachers) or a control group (CG, n=43 teachers). 
Teachers were eligible to participate if they reported no health issues that 
compromised their classroom responsibilities.
INTERVENTIONS: The IG participated in an individualised physiotherapy-directed 
occupational health programme (six 30-minute sessions) related to ergonomics and 
stress management conducted over a 5-month semester. The CG had a 
pseudo-intervention of one oral education session.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included scores from the physical and 
mental components and health transition item of the Short-Form-36 Health Survey 
questionnaire (SF-36), and emotional well-being and resistance to stress items 
from the work-related behaviour and experience patterns questionnaire. Data were 
collected before and after one semester.
RESULTS: The primary outcome measure, the SF-36 physical component score, showed 
a reduction in the CG and no change in the IG, meaning that the CG deteriorated 
over the study semester while the IG did not show any change.
CONCLUSIONS: A physiotherapy-directed occupational health programme may prevent 
deterioration of physical health of school teachers in one semester (proof of 
concept). This pilot study provided valuable information to inform the design of 
replication and extension studies related to this work.

Do modern total knee replacements offer better value for money? A health 
economic analysis.

PURPOSE: Cost effectiveness is an increasingly important factor in today's 
healthcare environment, and selection of arthroplasty implant is not exempt from 
such concerns. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are the typical tool for this 
type of evaluation. Using this methodology, joint arthroplasty has been shown to 
be cost effective; however, studies directly comparing differing prostheses are 
lacking.
METHODS: Data was gathered in a single-centre prospective double-blind 
randomised controlled trial comparing the outcome of modern and traditional knee 
implants, using the Short Form 6 dimensional (SF-6D) score and quality adjusted 
life year (QALY) methodology.
RESULTS: There was significant improvement in the SF-6D score for both groups at 
one year (p < 0.0001). The calculated overall life expectancy for the study 
cohort was 15.1 years, resulting in an overall QALY gain of 2.144 (95% CI 
1.752-2.507). The modern implant group demonstrated a small improvement in SF-6D 
score compared to the traditional design at one year (0.141 versus 0.143, p = 
0.94). This difference resulted in the modern implant costing £298 less per QALY 
at one year.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that modern implant technology does not 
influence the cost-effectiveness of TKA using the SF-6D and QALY methodology. 
This type of analysis however assesses health status, and is not sensitive to 
joint specific function. Evolutionary design changes in implant technology are 
thus unlikely to influence QALY analysis following joint replacement, which has 
important implications for implant procurement.

Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin for relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2023 Jul 5;7:CD006910.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women and it is 
usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. The majority of ovarian tumours are 
epithelial in origin. Women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) often 
have a reduced performance status with a limited life expectancy, therefore 
maintaining quality of life with effective symptom control is the main purpose 
of treatment. Drug treatment of relapsed disease is directed by the 
platinum-free interval: relapsed platinum-sensitive disease is usually 
re-treated with platinum-based therapy and platinum-resistant disease challenged 
with non-platinum drugs. However, the side-effects of chemotherapy agents may be 
severe and optimal treatment regimens are unclear. Pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin (PLD), which contains a cytotoxic drug called doxorubicin 
hydrochloride is one of several treatment modalities that may be considered for 
single-agent treatment of relapsed EOC, or used in combination with other drugs.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of PLD in women with relapsed 
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group (CGCG) 
trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1990 to February 2013. We also 
searched online registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings 
and reference lists of included studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated PLD in 
women diagnosed with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently abstracted data 
to a pre-designed data collection form and assessed the risk of bias according 
to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. 
Where possible, we pooled collected data in meta-analyses using RevMan 5.2 
software.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 RCTs that evaluated PLD alone or in combination 
with other drugs. Four RCTs contributed no data to the meta-analyses. Two 
studies compared PLD plus carboplatin (carbo) to paclitaxel (PAC)/carbo in women 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC. Overall survival (OS) was similar for 
these treatments, however progression-free survival (PFS) was longer with 
PLD/carbo (1164 participants; hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.74 to 0.97; I² = 7%; P value 0.01). PLD/carbo was associated with 
significantly more anaemia and thrombocytopenia than PAC/carbo, whereas 
PAC/carbo was associated with significantly more alopecia, neuropathies, 
hypersensitivity reactions and arthralgias/myalgias. PLD/carbo was 
well-tolerated and women receiving this treatment were significantly less likely 
to discontinue treatment than those receiving PAC/carbo (two studies, 1150 
participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.57; I² = 0%; P < 
0.00001).Five studies compared other agents to PLD alone. None of these agents 
were associated with significantly better survival or severe adverse-event 
profiles than PLD. Topotecan and gemcitabine were associated with significantly 
more haematological severe adverse events than PLD, and patupilone was 
associated with significantly more severe neuropathies and diarrhoea. Severe 
hand-foot syndrome (HFS) occurred consistently more frequently with PLD than the 
other drugs.Three studies compared PLD combination treatment to PLD alone. Two 
combinations resulted in a significantly longer PFS compared with PLD alone: 
trabectedin (TBD)/PLD (one study, 672 women; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96; P 
value 0.02) and vintafolide (EC145)/PLD (one study, 149 women; HR 0.63, 95% CI 
0.41 to 0.97; P value 0.04). TBD/PLD appeared to benefit the partially 
platinum-sensitive subgroup only. Further studies are likely to have an 
important impact on our confidence in these estimates. TBD/PLD was associated 
with significantly more haematological and gastrointestinal severe adverse 
events than PLD alone, whereas EC145/PLD appeared to be well-tolerated.For 
platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, the median PFS and OS for single-agent PLD 
across seven included studies was 15 weeks and 54 weeks, respectively. Severe 
HFS occurred significantly more frequently in women receiving a 50 mg/m² dose of 
PLD than those receiving less than 50 mg/m² (17% versus 2%, respectively; P 
value 0.01).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In platinum-sensitive relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer, 
PLD/carbo is more effective than PAC/carbo and is better tolerated; PLD/carbo 
should therefore be considered as first-line treatment in women with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC. PLD alone is a useful agent for 
platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, however it remains unclear how it compares with 
other single agents for this subgroup and in what order these agents should be 
used. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of PLD in combination 
with other agents in platinum-resistant relapsed EOC.

short-lived sibling species D. koepferae.

Two sibling Drosophila species dramatically divergent in longevity, Drosophila 
buzzatii and D. koepferae, were examined for possible effects of both 
developmental culture medium and dietary composition (DC) on longevity. 
Longevity was greatly increased in the longer lived D. buzzatii when flies were 
reared and fed on a rich-in-nutrient and cactus-based culture (R-CBC) as 
compared to longevity in a poor nutrient culture (PNC). In D. buzzatii, life 
span was further increased by exposing flies to short periods of a 
poor-in-nutrient and cactus-based culture (P-CBC). In contrast, variation in the 
here used nutrient composition did not change life span in the shorter lived D. 
koepferae, as longevity in this species did not differ among R-CBC, P-CBC and 
PNC cultures. Hormesis is a plausible explanation for the beneficial biological 
effects against aging arising from brief exposure to a lowed calorie food source 
in D. buzzatii. This study shows that genetic variation between closely related 
species is substantial for dietary effects on longevity.

Prophylaxis for latent tuberculosis infection prior to anti–tumor necrosis 
factor therapy in low-risk elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a 
decision analysis.

Hazlewood GS, Naimark D, Gardam M, Bykerk V, Bombardier C.

Comment in
    Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken). 2013 Nov;65(11):1719-21.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if low-risk elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) who screen positive for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to 
anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy should be given isoniazid (INH).
METHODS: A Markov model was developed. The base case was a patient age 65 years 
with RA starting anti-TNF therapy with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) 
finding of 5–9 mm, who was born in a country with low TB prevalence and had no 
other TB risk factors. The decision was 9 months of INH or not. The primary 
outcome was quality-adjusted life expectancy. Multiple sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: No prophylaxis was favored, with a gain of 1.1 quality-adjusted life 
days, but the decision was sensitive to several variables. Prophylaxis was 
favored for patients ages <61 years, if the relative risk (RR) of TB 
reactivation with RA alone was >2.5, if the RR with anti-TNF therapy was >5.8, 
or if the utility associated with INH therapy was >0.98. Prophylaxis was also 
preferred for patients with a TST result >10 mm and for patients from higher 
risk countries. If 6 months of INH or 4 months of rifampin were used, 
prophylaxis was preferred, providing that therapy reduced the risk of TB 
reactivation by >47% and >27%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Withholding prophylaxis prior to anti-TNF therapy may be reasonable 
for low-risk elderly RA patients with a TST finding of 5–9 mm, although the 
decision is sensitive to patient preferences. For patients age <61 years from a 
higher risk country, or with a TST finding >10 mm, prophylaxis is preferred.

Evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy 
from China's Huai River policy.

Chen Y(1), Ebenstein A, Greenstone M, Li H.

Author information:
(1)Applied Economics Department, Guanghua School of Management, Peking 
University, Beijing 100871, China.

Comment in
    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Aug 6;110(32):12861-2.

This paper's findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly 
increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 
million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of 
life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China's 
Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal 
for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. 
Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, 
we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m(3) [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. Further, the 
results indicate that life expectancies are about 5.5 y (95% CI: 0.8, 10.2) 
lower in the north owing to an increased incidence of cardiorespiratory 
mortality. More generally, the analysis suggests that long-term exposure to an 
additional 100 μg/m(3) of TSPs is associated with a reduction in life expectancy 
at birth of about 3.0 y (95% CI: 0.4, 5.6).

The impact of Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II) on health-related 
quality of life.

Raluy-Callado M, Chen WH, Whiteman DA, Fang J, Wiklund I.

BACKGROUND: Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II)) is a rare 
metabolic disease that can severely compromise health, well-being and life 
expectancy. Little evidence has been published on the impact of MPS II on 
health-related quality of life (HRQL). The objective of this study was to 
describe this impact using the Hunter Syndrome-Functional Outcomes for Clinical 
Understanding Scale (HS-FOCUS) questionnaire and a range of standard validated 
questionnaires previously used in paediatric populations.
METHODS: Clinical and demographic characteristics collected in a clinical trial 
and responses to four HRQL questionnaires completed both by patients and parents 
prior to enzyme replacement treatment were used. The association between 
questionnaire scores and clinical function parameters were tested using Spearman 
rank-order correlations. Results were compared to scores in other paediatric 
populations with chronic conditions obtained through a targeted literature 
search of published studies.
RESULTS: Overall, 96 male patients with MPS II and their parents were enrolled 
in the trial. All parents completed the questionnaires and 53 patients above 
12 years old also completed the self-reported versions. Parents' and patients' 
responses were analysed separately and results were very similar. Dysfunction 
according to the HS-FOCUS and the CHAQ was most pronounced in the physical 
function domains. Very low scores were reported in the Self Esteem and Family 
Cohesion domains in the CHQ and HUI3 disutility values indicated a moderate 
impact. Scores reported by patients and their parents were consistently lower 
than scores in the other paediatric populations identified (except the 
parent-reported Behaviour score); and considerably lower than normative values.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the impact on HRQL in patients with MPS II and 
provides a broader context by comparing it with that of other chronic paediatric 
diseases. Physical function and the ability to perform day-to-day activities 
were the most affected areas and a considerable impact on the psychological 
aspects of patients' HRQL was also found, with a higher level of impairment 
across most dimensions (particularly Pain and Self Esteem) than that of other 
paediatric populations. Such humanistic data provide increasingly important 
support for establishing priorities for health care spending, and as a component 
of health economic analysis.

Value of information: interim analysis of a randomized, controlled trial of 
goal-directed hemodynamic treatment for aged patients.

BACKGROUND: A randomized, controlled trial, intended to include 460 patients, is 
currently studying peroperative goal-directed hemodynamic treatment (GDHT) of 
aged hip-fracture patients. Interim efficacy analysis performed on the first 100 
patients was statistically uncertain; thus, the trial is continuing in 
accordance with the trial protocol. This raised the present investigation's main 
question: Is it reasonable to continue to fund the trial to decrease 
uncertainty? To answer this question, a previously developed probabilistic 
cost-effectiveness model was used. That model depicts (1) a choice between 
routine fluid treatment and GDHT, given uncertainty of current evidence and (2) 
the monetary value of further data collection to decrease uncertainty. This 
monetary value, that is, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), could 
be used to compare future research costs. Thus, the primary aim of the present 
investigation was to analyze EVPI of an ongoing trial with interim efficacy 
observed.
METHODS: A previously developed probabilistic decision analytic 
cost-effectiveness model was employed to compare the routine fluid treatment to 
GDHT. Results from the interim analysis, published trials, the meta-analysis, 
and the registry data were used as model inputs. EVPI was predicted using (1) 
combined uncertainty of model inputs; (2) threshold value of society's 
willingness to pay for one, quality-adjusted life-year; and (3) estimated number 
of future patients exposed to choice between GDHT and routine fluid treatment 
during the expected lifetime of GDHT.
RESULTS: If a decision to use GDHT were based on cost-effectiveness, then the 
decision would have a substantial degree of uncertainty. Assuming a 5-year 
lifetime of GDHT in clinical practice, the number of patients who would be 
subject to future decisions was 30,400. EVPI per patient would be €204 at a 
€20,000 threshold value of society's willingness to pay for one quality-adjusted 
life-year. Given a future population of 30,400 individuals, total EVPI would be 
€6.19 million.
CONCLUSIONS: If future trial costs are below EVPI, further data collection is 
potentially cost-effective. When applying a cost-effectiveness model, statements 
such as 'further research is needed' are replaced with 'further research is 
cost-effective and 'further funding of a trial is justified'.

Cost-effectiveness of MRI for breast cancer screening in BRCA1/2 mutation 
carriers.

BACKGROUND: Women with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at high risk of 
developing breast cancer and, in British Columbia, Canada, are offered screening 
with both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography to facilitate early 
detection. MRI is more sensitive than mammography but is more costly and 
produces more false positive results. The purpose of this study was to calculate 
the cost-effectiveness of MRI screening for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation 
carriers in a Canadian setting.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model of annual MRI and mammography screening 
for BRCA1/2 carriers, using local data and published values. We calculated 
cost-effectiveness as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY), and 
conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of annual mammography 
plus MRI screening, compared to annual mammography alone, was $50,900/QALY. 
After incorporating parameter uncertainty, MRI screening is expected to be a 
cost-effective option 86% of the time at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY, 
and 53% of the time at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY. The model is highly 
sensitive to the cost of MRI; as the cost is increased from $200 to $700 per 
scan, the ICER ranges from $37,100/QALY to $133,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of using MRI and mammography in combination 
to screen for breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is finely balanced. The 
sensitivity of the results to the cost of the MRI screen itself warrants 
consideration: in jurisdictions with higher MRI costs, screening may not be a 
cost-effective use of resources, but improving the efficiency of MRI screening 
will also improve cost-effectiveness.

    Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2013 Jul;6(4):376-8.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) seems to improve the 
survival and quality of life of patients with aortic stenosis ineligible for 
surgical aortic valve replacement.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a decision analytic Markov model to estimate 
lifetime costs and benefits in a hypothetical cohort of patients with severe, 
symptomatic aortic stenosis who were ineligible for surgical aortic valve 
replacement. The model compared transfemoral TAVR with medical management and 
was calibrated to the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial. 
TAVR increased life expectancy from 2.08 to 2.93 years and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy from 1.19 to 1.93 years. TAVR also reduced subsequent 
hospitalizations by 1.40 but increased complications, particularly stroke (from 
1% to 11% lifetime risk), and also increased lifetime costs from $83,600 to 
$169,100. The incremental cost-effectiveness of TAVR was $116,500 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained ($99,900 per life-year gained). Results were 
robust to reasonable changes in individual variables but were sensitive to the 
level of annual healthcare costs caused by noncardiac diseases and to the 
projected life expectancy of medically treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR seems to be an effective but somewhat expensive alternative to 
medical management among patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis ineligible 
for surgery. TAVR is more cost-effective for patients with a lower burden of 
noncardiac disease.

Life-extending ovariectomy in grasshoppers increases somatic storage, but 
dietary restriction with an equivalent feeding rate does not.

Reduced diet or reduced reproduction each extends lifespan in many animals. It 
is often thought that reduced reproduction and reduced diet may act through the 
same mechanisms. In grasshoppers, ovariectomy extends lifespan and reduces 
feeding to a level similar to that used for life extension by dietary 
restriction, further suggesting mechanistic overlap. Here, we measure the 
feeding rate of ovariectomized grasshoppers and, by manipulating feeding levels, 
create a sham-operated & dietary restricted group with matched daily feeding. 
Both groups show ~25% increased survivorship near the median age of mortality 
for fully fed and reproductive controls. Ovariectomy results in a doubling of 
fat body mass and hemolymph volume in comparison to both a feeding-matched 
dietary restriction group and a sham-operated & fully fed control, which do not 
differ from each other. Total anti-oxidant activity in the hemolymph and the 
skeletal muscle was unchanged upon ovariectomy or dietary restriction, so it 
does not appear to be a major factor in lifespan extension. Next, we measured 
mitochondrial counts using qPCR to determine mitochondrial cytochrome-b 
concentrations relative to nuclear (genomic) beta-actin. Mitochondrial counts in 
the ovariectomized group were lower than sham-operated and fully fed controls 
but not than the dietary restriction group. Last, in the fat body, transcript 
levels of hexamerin-90 (a hemolymph storage protein) were affected by neither 
ovariectomy nor dietary restriction. Hence, ovariectomy resulted in large 
magnitude increases in organismal storage. The matched-fed dietary restricted 
group differed from the ovariectomized group only in organismal storage, and not 
in any of the cellular parameters measured here. This study suggests that 
longevity via ovariectomy has distinct physiological mechanisms from longevity 
via dietary restriction in grasshoppers that are independent of daily feeding 
rate, particularly for protein and fat storage.

BACKGROUND: hospital falls place a substantial burden on healthcare systems. 
There has been limited research into the use of hospital flooring as an 
intervention against fall-related injuries.
OBJECTIVE: to assess the cost-effectiveness of shock-absorbing flooring compared 
with standard hospital flooring in hospital wards for older people.
DESIGN: a cost-utility analysis was undertaken drawing upon data collected in a 
pilot cluster randomised controlled trial and the wider literature.
SETTING: the trial included eight hospital sites across England. Four sites 
installed shock-absorbing flooring in one bay, and four maintained their 
standard flooring.
MEASUREMENTS: falls and resulting injuries and treatment were reported by 
hospital staff. Data on destination of discharge were collected. Patients were 
followed up at 3 months and further resource use data were collected. 
Health-related quality of life was assessed, allowing quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) to be estimated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the 
shock-absorbing flooring was assessed compared with the standard hospital 
flooring.
RESULTS: in the base case, the shock-absorbing flooring was cost saving, but 
generated QALY losses due to an increase in the faller rate reported in the 
intervention arm. Scenario analysis showed that if the shock-absorbing flooring 
does not increase the faller rate it is likely to represent a dominant economic 
strategy-generating cost savings and QALY gains.
CONCLUSION: the shock-absorbing flooring intervention has the potential to be 
cost-effective but further research is required on whether the intervention 
flooring results in a higher faller rate than standard flooring.

Cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive versus open esophagectomy for 
esophageal cancer.

BACKGROUND: A recent randomized trial comparing minimally invasive (MIE) and 
open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer reported improved short-term outcomes. 
However, MIE has increased operative costs, and it is unclear whether the 
short-term benefits of MIE outweigh the increased operative costs. Therefore, 
the objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of MIE 
compared to open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model was developed to estimate the expected costs 
and outcomes after MIE and open esophagectomy from a health care system 
perspective with a time horizon of 1 year. Costs were represented in 2012 
Canadian dollars, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessed parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: MIE was estimated to cost $1641 (95% confidence interval 1565, 1718) 
less than open esophagectomy, with an incremental gain of 0.022 QALYs (95% 
confidence interval 0.021, 0.023). MIE was therefore dominant over open 
esophagectomy. On deterministic sensitivity analyses, the results were most 
sensitive to variations in length of stay. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated the robustness of the base case result, with 66, 77, and 82% 
probabilities of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $0/QALY, 
$50,000/QALY, and $100,000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: MIE is cost-effective compared to open esophagectomy in patients 
with resectable esophageal cancer.

BACKGROUND: To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) tolerability and efficacy 
of intra-arterial chemotherapy with irinotecan in patients with liver metastases 
of colorectal carcinoma (CRC).
METHODS: Superselective intra-arterial irinotecan was applied on days 1, 14, 28 
and 42. The initial dose was 140 mg/m² with escalation in the subsequent patient 
group to 160 mg/m². The final protocol toxicity evaluation was 260 mg/m². 
Patients required histologically proven disease and adequate bone marrow, liver 
and renal function, no extrahepatic metastasis and a life expectancy >12 weeks. 
results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled (median age 65, range 49-78 years). 
On dose level VI (240 mg/m²), 1 case of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 
(granulocytopenia) was observed, leading to an enlarged cohort of 6 patients. As 
no additional DLT was detected on this level, an escalation to level VII was 
performed. On the dose level of 260 mg/m², irinotecan DLTs were observed, 
resulting in the termination of escalation and the declaration of dose level VI 
as MTD. Imaging follow-up with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) criteria revealed a complete response in 1 patient, stable disease in 
31 patients, and progressed disease in 1 patient. The median time to progression 
was 4.7 months, the median overall survival 15.6 months.
CONCLUSION: The method of intra-arterial chemotherapy with irinotecan is well 
tolerated and shows promising local response rates in liver metastases of CRC.

AIMS: To assess the impact on healthcare resource utilization, costs, and 
quality of life over 15 years from 5 years of statin use in men without a 
history of myocardial infarction in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention 
Study (WOSCOPS).
METHODS: Six thousand five hundred and ninety-five participants aged 45-54 years 
were randomized to 5 years treatment with pravastatin (40 mg) or placebo. 
Linkage to routinely collected health records extended follow-up for secondary 
healthcare resource utilization to 15 years. The following new results are 
reported: cause-specific first and recurrent cardiovascular hospital admissions 
including myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, coronary 
revascularization and angiography; non-cardiovascular hospitalization; days in 
hospital; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); costs of pravastatin treatment, 
treatment safety monitoring, and hospital admissions.
RESULTS: Five years treatment of 1000 patients with pravastatin (40 mg/day) 
saved the NHS £710 000 (P < 0.001), including the cost of pravastatin and lipid 
and safety monitoring, and gained 136 QALYs (P = 0.017) over the 15-year period. 
Benefits per 1000 subjects, attributable to prevention of cardiovascular events, 
included 163 fewer admissions and a saving of 1836 days in hospital, with fewer 
admissions for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and coronary 
revascularization. There was no excess in non-cardiovascular admissions or costs 
(or in admissions associated with diabetes or its complications) and no evidence 
of heterogeneity of effect over sub-groups defined by baseline cardiovascular 
risk.
CONCLUSION: Five years' primary prevention treatment of middle-aged men with a 
statin significantly reduces healthcare resource utilization, is cost saving, 
and increases QALYs. Treatment of even younger, lower risk individuals is likely 
to be cost-effective.

Decomposition of number of life years lost according to causes of death.

Andersen PK(1).

Author information:

PB2099, DK-1014 Copenhagen K, Denmark.

We study the competing risks model and show that the cause j cumulative 
incidence function integrated from 0 to τ has a natural interpretation as the 
expected number of life years lost due to cause j before time τ. This is 
analogous to the τ-restricted mean lifetime, which is the survival function 
integrated from 0 to τ. It is discussed how the number of years lost may be 
related to subject-specific explanatory variables in a regression model based on 
pseudo-observations, and the method is exemplified using data from a bone marrow 
transplantation study. Finally, inclusion of standard mortality rates is 
discussed.

elderly patients.

AIM: To determine whether an active intervention is beneficial for the survival 
of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: The survival of 740 patients who received various treatments for HCC 
between 1983 and 2011 was compared among different age groups using Cox 
regression analysis. Therapeutic options were principally selected according to 
the clinical practice guidelines for HCC from the Japanese Society of 
Hepatology. The treatment most likely to achieve regional control capability was 
chosen, as far as possible, in the following order: resection, radiofrequency 
ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization, transarterial oily chemoembolization, hepatic arterial 
infusion chemotherapy, systemic chemotherapy including molecular targeting, or 
best supportive care. Each treatment was used alone, or in combination, with a 
clinical goal of striking the best balance between functional hepatic reserve 
and the volume of the targeted area, irrespective of their age. The percent 
survival to life expectancy was calculated based on a Japanese national 
population survey.
RESULTS: The median ages of the subjects during each 5-year period from 1986 
were 61, 64, 67, 68 and 71 years and increased significantly with time (P < 
0.0001). The Child-Pugh score was comparable among younger (59 years of age or 
younger), middle-aged (60-79 years of age), and older (80 years of age or older) 
groups (P = 0.34), whereas the tumor-node-metastasis stage tended to be more 
advanced in the younger group (P = 0.060). Advanced disease was significantly 
more frequent in the younger group compared with the middle-aged group (P = 
0.010), whereas there was no difference between the middle-aged and elderly 
groups (P = 0.75). The median survival times were 2593, 2011, 1643, 1278 and 
1195 d for 49 years of age or younger, 50-59 years of age, 60-69 years of age, 
70-79 years of age, or 80 years of age or older age groups, respectively, 
whereas the median percent survival to life expectancy were 13.9%, 21.9%, 24.7%, 
25.7% and 37.6% for each group, respectively. The impact of age on actual 
survival time was significant (P = 0.020) with a hazard ratio of 1.021, 
suggesting that a 10-year-older patient has a 1.23-fold higher risk for death, 
and the overall survival was the worst in the oldest group. On the other hand, 
when the survival benefit was evaluated on the basis of percent survival to life 
expectancy, age was again found to be a significant explanatory factor (P = 
0.022); however, the oldest group showed the best survival among the five 
different age groups. The youngest group revealed the worst outcomes in this 
analysis, and the hazard ratio of the oldest against the youngest was 0.35 for 
death. The survival trends did not differ substantially between the survival 
time and percent survival to life expectancy, when survival was compared overall 
or among various therapeutic interventions.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a therapeutic approach for HCC should not 
be restricted due to patient age.

In the current issue of Population Health Metrics, two reports paint a bleak 
picture of American public health. Both physical inactivity and obesity remain 
highly prevalent; yet, it is not clear that increased physical activity will 
reduce the burden of obesity. There continue to be widespread disparities in 
life expectancy across United States counties. These reports appear against a 
backdrop of debate regarding how we should allocate our scarce resources for 
improving health: should we focus more on improving access to high-quality 
medical care, or should we instead focus on more and better public health 
interventions? While optimal solutions remain obscure, a look at prior successes 
suggests that ultimately they will come from the conduct and implementation of 
rigorous science, and in particular event-driven trials.

Left behind: widening disparities for males and females in US county life 
expectancy, 1985-2010.

BACKGROUND: The United States spends more than any other country on health care. 
The poor relative performance of the US compared to other high-income countries 
has attracted attention and raised questions about the performance of the US 
health system. An important dimension to poor national performance is the large 
disparities in life expectancy.
METHODS: We applied a mixed effects Poisson statistical model and Gaussian 
Process Regression to estimate age-specific mortality rates for US counties from 
1985 to 2010. We generated uncertainty distributions for life expectancy at each 
age using standard simulation methods.
RESULTS: Female life expectancy in the United States increased from 78.0 years 
in 1985 to 80.9 years in 2010, while male life expectancy increased from 71.0 
years in 1985 to 76.3 years in 2010. The gap between female and male life 
expectancy in the United States was 7.0 years in 1985, narrowing to 4.6 years in 
2010. For males at the county level, the highest life expectancy steadily 
increased from 75.5 in 1985 to 81.7 in 2010, while the lowest life expectancy 
remained under 65. For females at the county level, the highest life expectancy 
increased from 81.1 to 85.0, and the lowest life expectancy remained around 73. 
For male life expectancy at the county level, there have been three phases in 
the evolution of inequality: a period of rising inequality from 1985 to 1993, a 
period of stable inequality from 1993 to 2002, and rising inequality from 2002 
to 2010. For females, in contrast, inequality has steadily increased during the 
25-year period. Compared to only 154 counties where male life expectancy 
remained stagnant or declined, 1,405 out of 3,143 counties (45%) have seen no 
significant change or a significant decline in female life expectancy from 1985 
to 2010. In all time periods, the lowest county-level life expectancies are seen 
in the South, the Mississippi basin, West Virginia, Kentucky, and selected 
counties with large Native American populations.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the number of counties where female life 
expectancy at birth is declining in the most recent period is welcome news. 
However, the widening disparities between counties and the slow rate of increase 
compared to other countries should be viewed as a call for action. An increased 
focus on factors affecting health outcomes, morbidity, and mortality such as 
socioeconomic factors, difficulty of access to and poor quality of health care, 
and behavioral, environmental, and metabolic risk factors is urgently required.
