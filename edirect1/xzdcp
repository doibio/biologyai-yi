BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of treating displaced, intra-articular distal radial 
fractures with volar locking plate fixation compared with augmented external 
fixation.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside a randomized, clinical 
trial comparing 2 surgical interventions for intra-articular distal radial 
fractures. One hundred and sixty-six patients were allocated to either volar 
locking plate fixation (84 patients) or external fixation (82 patients) and were 
followed for 2 years. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions and was used to calculate patients' quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Resource use was identified prospectively at the patient 
level at all follow-up intervals. Costs were estimated with use of both a 
health-care perspective and a societal perspective. Results were expressed in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and uncertainty was assessed with use of 
bootstrapping methods.
RESULTS: The average QALY value was equivalent between the groups (1.70463 for 
the volar locking plate group and 1.70726 for the external fixation group, 
yielding a nonsignificant difference of -0.00263 QALY). Health-care costs were 
equal between the groups, with a nonsignificant difference of &OV0556;52 (p = 
0.8) in favor of external fixation. However, the external fixation group had a 
higher loss of productivity due to absence from work (5.5 weeks in the volar 
locking plate group compared with 9.2 weeks for the external fixation group; p = 
0.02). Consequently, the societal costs were higher for the external fixation 
group compared with the volar locking plate group (&OV0556;18,037 compared with 
&OV0556;12,567, representing a difference of &OV0556;5,470; p = 0.04) in favor 
of the volar locking plate group. Uncertainty analyses showed that there is 
indifference regarding which method to recommend from a health-care perspective, 
with volar locking plate treatment and external fixation having a 47% and 53% 
likelihood of being cost-effective, respectively. From the societal perspective, 
volar locking plate treatment had a 90% likelihood of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: External fixation was less cost-effective than volar locking plate 
treatment for distal radial fractures from a societal perspective, primarily 
because patients managed with external fixation had a longer absence from work.

Obesity is a growing health problem in both children and adults, impairing 
physical and mental state and impacting health care system costs in both 
developed and developing countries. It is well-known that individuals with 
excessive weight gain frequently develop obesity-related complications, which 
are mainly known as Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular 
disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and many other risk factors proven to be 
associated with chronic inflammation, causing disability and reduced life 
expectancy. This review aims to present and discuss complications related to 
inflammation in pediatric obesity, the critical role of nutrition and diet in 
obesity-comorbidity prevention and treatment, and the impact of lifestyle. 
Appropriate early dietary intervention for the management of pediatric 
overweight and obesity is recommended for overall healthy growth and prevention 
of comorbidities in adulthood.

BACKGROUND: Extensile lateral approach had been recognized as the gold standard 
technique for displaced intra-articular calcaneus fractures (DIACFs) while sinus 
tarsi approach had been increasingly valued by surgeons and comparative clinical 
outcome was shown in both techniques. Appropriate decisions could be made by the 
clinicians with the help of cost-utility analysis (CUA) about optimal healthcare 
for type II/III calcaneus fracture.
METHOD: A single-center, retrospective study was conducted in which basic 
characteristics, clinical outcomes, and health care costs of 109 patients had 
been obtained and analyzed. Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
scores, validated by EuroQol five-dimensional-three levels (EQ-5D-3L), were used 
to enumerate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was 
determined by the incremental cost per QALY.
RESULTS: One hundred nine patients were enrolled in our study including 62 in 
the ELA group and 47 in the STA group. There were no significant differences 
between these two groups in mean total cost, laboratory, and radiographic 
evaluation expense, surgery, anesthesia, and antibiotic expense. The expense of 
internal fixation materials ($3289.0 ± 543.9) versus ($2630.6 ± 763.7) and 
analgesia ($145.8 ± 85.6) versus ($102.9 ± 62.7) in ELA group were significantly 
higher than in the STA group (P < .001, P = .008, respectively). Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS) scores showed significant difference at postoperative 3 and 5 days 
(P < .001). American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot 
scores and the Bohlers' and Gissane angle showed no significant differences 
between the two groups before and after the operation. The cost-effectiveness 
ratios of ELA and STA were $8766.8 ± 2835.2/QALY and $7914.9 ± 1822.0/QALY 
respectively, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) of ELA over STA 
was $32110.00/QALY, but both showed no significant difference.
CONCLUSION: Both ELA and STA techniques are effective operative procedures for 
the patients with calcaneus fracture. Moreover, STA seems to be more reasonable 
for its merits including less postoperative pain, and less expense of analgesia 
as well as internal fixation materials.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people living with HIV is markedly increasing 
with the introduction of effective antiretroviral medications. However, these 
patients face an increased risk of developing multi-morbidities-especially with 
advanced age. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of and risk 
factors associated with the occurrence of chronic comorbidities among patients 
diagnosed with HIV infection.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on the medical records of 
patients with HIV diagnoses from 2000 to 2018. Data were collected on age, sex, 
date of diagnosis, associated co-morbidities, antiretroviral medications (ART) 
and status at time of data collection (alive or deceased). Only adult patients 
18 years or above were studied.
RESULTS: A total of 130 confirmed HIV cases were included. Patient ages ranged 
from 23 to 86 years old (mean±SD 50.1±12.6). Almost half of the patients (48.5%) 
had at least one associated comorbidity. The most common chronic comorbidity was 
diabetes mellitus (15.4%), followed by dyslipidemia (10.8%), hypertension 
(10.8%) and lymphoma (10.0%). Comorbidity proportions increased with advanced 
patient age (p=0.047). Three or more comorbidities were reported in 40.7% of 
patients aged 60 years old or above. Using logistic regression analysis, only 
patients aged 50 years old or above were more likely to have at least one 
comorbidity (OR=7.59, 95%CI=2.25, 25.61).
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of chronic comorbidities among people diagnosed with HIV 
is high, especially among older age individuals, with an increasing number of 
comorbidities per patient. Proper counseling for HIV patients is highly 
recommended-not only for prevention of other infectious diseases (e.g., 
vaccination) but also for lifestyle modification and self-management for those 
with chronic conditions.

OBJECTIVES: Endovascular therapy (EVT) significantly improves clinical outcomes 
in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), while the time of EVT initiation 
after stroke onset influences both patient clinical outcomes and healthcare 
costs. This study determined the impact of EVT treatment delay on cost 
effectiveness of EVT in the Singapore healthcare setting.
DESIGN: A short-term decision tree and long-term Markov health state transition 
model was constructed. For each time window of symptom onset to EVT, the 
probability of receiving EVT or non-EVT treatment was varied, thereby varying 
clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores), short-term costs and long-term 
modelled (lifetime) costs; all of which were used in calculating an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of EVT vs non-EVT treatment. Clinical outcomes and cost 
data were derived from clinical trials, literature, expert opinion, electronic 
medical records and community-based surveys from Singapore. Deterministic 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the 
uncertainty of the model. The willingness to pay for per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) was set to Singapore $50 000 (US$36 500).
SETTING: Singapore healthcare perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: The model included patients with AIS in Singapore.
INTERVENTIONS: EVT performed within 6 hours of stroke onset.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The model estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMB) for EVT versus non-EVT treatment, varied 
by time from symptom onset to time of treatment.
RESULTS: EVT performed between 61 min and 120 min after the stroke onset was 
most cost-effective time window to perform EVT in the Singapore population, with 
an ICER of Singapore $7197 per QALY (US$5254) for performing EVT at 61-120 min 
versus 121-180 min. The resulting incremental NMB associated with receipt of EVT 
at the earlier time point is Singapore $39 827 (US$29 074) per patient at the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of Singapore $50 000. Each hour delay in EVT 
resulted in an average loss of 0.54 QALYs and 195.35 healthy days, with an 
average net monetary loss of Singapore $26 255 (US$19 166).
CONCLUSIONS: From the Singapore healthcare perspective, although EVT is more 
expensive than alternative treatments in the short term, the lifetime ICER is 
below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Thus, healthcare policies and procedures 
should aim to improve efficiency of pre-hospital and in-hospital workflow 
processes to reduce the onset-to-puncture duration.

As the population of western countries is aging, the number of patients 
diagnosed with cancer is growing. Therefore older people, more susceptible to 
develop pancreatic malignancy, will likely represent the prototype of a 
pancreatic cancer patient in the near future. Diagnostic modalities utilised for 
younger patients are also applicable for older individuals. There is 
accumulative evidence that biological age is not an independent factor 
predicting poor outcome in elderly patients with resectable disease undergoing 
surgery, however increased postoperative morbidity and mortality within the 
elderly group has also been reported. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be offered in 
all patients with good performance status regardless of their age. Palliative 
measures for unresectable tumours including relief from biliary and duodenal 
obstruction as well as chemotherapy should be considered in non-frail patients 
with reasonable life expectancy. Palliative chemotherapy options are FOLFIRINOX 
or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for patients with good performance status (0-1) 
and gemcitabine alone for patients with performance status 2-3. The cornerstone 
for improving the outcomes of the elderly age group is careful patient selection 
and perioperative optimization of those who have indication for surgery. 
Patients and their carers should be involved in the decision making process with 
emphasis on the expected functional recovery after the proposed treatment 
modality. The presence of geriatricians in the multidisciplinary team meetings 
is crucial in order to identify the optimal treatment pathway for elderly 
patients. Geriatric input regarding peri-habilitation pathways to improve 
surgical outcomes, to decrease mortality and to expedite patients' functional 
recovery is highly recommended.

BACKGROUND: The most important outcome for patients undergoing trabeculectomy is 
to maintain the quality of life in their remaining years. This study quantifies 
end of life vision in terms of visual acuity (VA) and visual field status.
METHODS: A prospective service evaluation of patients undergoing trabeculectomy 
(from 2000 to 2012) who died prior to the study evaluation point (November 
2018). Demographic data including socioeconomic status were collected and change 
in clinical measurement for the cohort between time of surgery and death was 
measured.
RESULTS: 160 of 659 patients had died (24.3%), 4 were excluded due to 
insufficient data, leaving 156 patients (196 eyes) for evaluation. 
Male-to-female ratio was 3:2, 86% of patients were Caucasian. Mean age at 
surgery on first eye was 76.5 years (SD 9.0). Life expectancy 
post-trabeculectomy was 7.5 years (0.1-17.2). Mean change in VA was logarithm of 
the mean angle of resolution (LogMAR) 0.32 (SD 0.59) and visual field mean 
deviation progressed at a median of -0.44 dB/year (from -5.98 to 3.9) for eyes 
with at least a year of follow-up. Severe vision loss (loss of ≥10 letters on 
LogMAR) occurred in 78 eyes (40%) of which 18 (9%) were due to glaucoma, 69 
patients (44%) required glaucoma drops at end of life.
CONCLUSION: Trabeculectomy is successful in slowing or preventing further 
glaucoma progression and thus maintaining visual function in the majority of 
eyes for the remainder of life. For those with severe vision loss at the end of 
life, only one in four was due to further progression of their glaucoma.

BACKGROUND Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a life-threatening infection of 
the renal parenchyma. The purpose of this report is to present a case of EPN 
with distinctive imaging. CASE REPORT An 87-year-old man with a history of type 
2 diabetes mellitus presented to the ER with fever and shivering, hypotension, 
and anuria, which is a clinical presentation of septic shock. He had recently 
been hospitalized at another hospital due to myocardial infarction and ischemic 
stroke, where a temporary urinary catheter was placed. Upon physical 
examination, he had right lateral abdominal pain with extension to the right 
renal region. Laboratory studies showed leucocytosis (WBC: 24 320/μl with 94.4% 
polymorphonuclear), elevated C-reactive protein 340 mg/l (NV <3.45), and acute 
renal failure (urea 155mg/dl NV <50 mg/dl, creatinine 4.4 mg/dl NV <1.2 mg/dl). 
A plain X-ray showed air was present peripheral to the right kidney, while the 
abdominal CT revealed air inside the right kidney and bilateral nephrolithiasis. 
The patient was initially put on aggressive hydration, vasoconstrictors, and 
hydrocortisone to treat the septic shock, and an advanced antibiotic treatment 
(meropenem) was initiated immediately. Blood culture grew Escherichia coli. 
After 3 days of treatment, he showed significant improvement in diuresis and 
renal function (urea 90 mg/dl, creatinine 1.0 mg/dl), with a concomitant 
decrease in inflammatory markers (CRP 36.7 mg/l). The antibiotic treatment was 
tapered to cefuroxime and metronidazole. The patient's condition improved, and 
he was discharged with per os antibiotic treatment. Subsequently, surgical 
assessment for the nephrolithiasis was suggested. CONCLUSIONS Emphysematous 
pyelonephritis, although rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis 
of fever in a diabetic patient with renal pain.

INTRODUCTION: Considering the relevance of the quality of life (QoL) and the 
consequences of the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to the social 
distancing, this systematic review aimed to summarize effects of the COVID-19 in 
the QoL of the studied populations.
AREAS COVERED: Four databases, the methodological quality and the risk of bias 
in selected publications were investigated. Seven thousand and fifty-one 
individuals from Italy, Saudi Arabia, China, and Vietnam. Online system and 
printed questionnaires were used to assess the QoL, as patients affected by 
primary antibody deﬁciencies, residents, people from endemic and no endemic 
regions, and individuals with COVID-19. Different types of questionnaires are 
utilized to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The methodological 
quality of three papers was good with low risk of bias and a decrease in the 
QoL.
EXPERT OPINION: The QoL of studies populations where COVID-19 was reported, 
worsened. Nevertheless, considering some indicators (infant mortality, average 
income, life expectancy, health coverage, and average schooling years), the 
standard of life and subsequently the quality of life among the presented 
countries (China, Vietnam, Italy, and Saudi Arabia) are different. Therefore, 
the simple comparison of these populations and the conclusions from this 
comparison must be done carefully.

OBJECTIVES: Economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions, which aim to 
prevent diabetes/cardiovascular disease (CVD), have not included dementia. 
Lifestyle interventions decrease dementia risk and extend life expectancy, 
leading to competing effects on health care costs. We aim to demonstrate the 
feasibility of including dementia in a public health cost-effectiveness analysis 
and quantify the overall impacts accounting for these competing effects.
METHODS: The School for Public Health Research (SPHR) diabetes prevention model 
describes individuals' risk of type 2 diabetes, microvascular outcomes, CVD, 
congestive heart failure, cancer, osteoarthritis, depression, and mortality in 
England. In version 3.1, we adapted the model to include dementia using 
published data from primary care databases, health surveys, and trials of 
dementia to describe dementia incidence, diagnosis, and disease progression. We 
estimate the impact of dementia on lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained of the National Health Service diabetes prevention program 
(NHS DPP) from an NHS/personal social services perspective with 3 scenarios: 1) 
no dementia, 2) dementia only, and 3) reduced dementia risk. Subgroup, 
parameter, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The lifetime cost savings of the NHS DPP per patient were £145 in the 
no-dementia scenario, £121 in the dementia-only scenario, and £167 in the 
reduced dementia risk scenario. The QALY gains increased by 0.0006 in dementia 
only and 0.0134 in reduced dementia risk. Dementia did not alter the 
recommendation that the NHS/DPP is cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Including dementia into a model of lifestyle interventions was 
feasible but did not change policy recommendations or modify health economic 
outcomes. The impact on health economic outcomes was largest where a direct 
impact on dementia incidence was assumed, particularly in elderly populations.

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the third most common and deadly hematological 
malignancy, which is characterized by a progressive monoclonal proliferation 
within the bone marrow. MM is cytogenetically heterogeneous with numerous 
genetic and epigenetic alterations, which lead to a wide spectrum of signaling 
pathways and cell cycle checkpoint aberrations. MM symptoms can be attributed to 
CRAB features (hyperCalcemia, Renal failure, Anemia, and Bone lesion), which 
profoundly affect both the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and the life 
expectancy of patients. Despite all enhancement and improvement in therapeutic 
strategies, MM is almost incurable, and patients suffering from this disease 
eventually relapse. Curcumin is an active and non-toxic phenolic compound, 
isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. It has been widely studied and has 
a confirmed broad range of therapeutic properties, especially anti-cancer 
activity, and others, including anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, 
antioxidant and anti-mutation activities. Curcumin induces apoptosis in 
cancerous cells and prevents Multidrug Resistance (MDR). Growing evidence 
concerning the therapeutic properties of curcumin caused a pharmacological 
impact on MM. It is confirmed that curcumin interferes with various signaling 
pathways and cell cycle checkpoints, and with oncogenes. In this paper, we 
summarized the anti- MM effects of curcumin.

Treatment expectations seem to affect bowel health when using acupuncture during 
radiotherapy for cancer: Secondary outcomes from a clinical randomized 
sham-controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if frequent stools ("diarrhoea"), infrequent stools 
("constipation"), capacity in daily activities and Quality of Life (QoL) 
differed between patients treated with verum or sham acupuncture, and if 
patients with more positive treatment expectations differed regarding frequent 
stools and infrequent stools from patients with less positive treatment 
expectations.
METHODS: In this randomized sham controlled trial, 200 patients received verum 
traditional penetrating acupuncture or sham acupuncture using a telescopic 
non-penetrating sham-needle 2-3 times a week during abdominal-pelvic 
radiotherapy (12 needling sessions during median 5 radiotherapy weeks). The 
patients registered stool frequency once a week, and registered capacity in 
daily activities and QoL at the start and end of radiotherapy, and at a 
one-month follow-up.
RESULTS: In the verum acupuncture group, 29 of 96 answering patients (30 %) 
experienced frequent stools and 7 (7 %) experienced infrequent stools at least 
one week of radiotherapy. In the sham acupuncture group, 21 of 97 (22 %) 
experienced frequent stools (p = 0.175) and 10 (10 %) experienced infrequent 
stools (p = 0.613). Patients with low treatment expectancy were more likely than 
other patients to experience frequent stools (60 % versus 26 %, p = 0.014) but 
not to experience infrequent stools (25 % versus 12 %, p = 0.334).
CONCLUSION: Penetrating acupuncture was not effective for frequent stools or for 
infrequent stools and did not improve capacity in daily activities or QoL in 
patients undergoing pelvic-abdominal irradiation for cancer more than 
non-penetrating acupuncture. Since patients with low acupuncture treatment 
expectations were more likely to experience frequent stools compared to other 
patients, non-specific treatment effects warrant further studies.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of olaparib monotherapy 
in the first-line maintenance setting vs. surveillance in women with newly 
diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation from a US third-party 
payer perspective.
METHODS: A three-state (progression free, progressed disease, and death) 
partitioned survival model over a 50-year lifetime horizon was developed. 
Piecewise models were applied to data from the phase III trial SOLO1 to 
extrapolate survival outcomes. Health state utilities and adverse event 
disutilities were obtained from literature and SOLO1. Treatment costs, adverse 
event costs, and medical costs associated with health states were obtained from 
publicly available databases, SOLO1, and real-world data. Time on treatment was 
estimated using the data from SOLO1. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) and life year (LY) gained were estimated. One-way deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, olaparib was associated with an additional 
3.63 LYs and 2.93 QALYs, and an incremental total cost of $152,545 vs. 
surveillance. Incremental cost per LY gained and per QALY gained for olaparib 
were $42,032 and $51,986, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios remained below $100,000 across a range of inputs and scenarios. In the 
PSA, the probability of olaparib being cost-effective at a $100,000 per QALY 
threshold was 99%.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to surveillance, olaparib increases both the LYs and QALYs 
of women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and with a germline or 
somatic BRCA mutation. Olaparib offers a cost-effective maintenance option for 
these women from a US third-party payer perspective.

Are countries at a low level of socio-economic development catching up with 
developed countries over time or rather falling further behind? Existing work on 
the subject is not conclusive, partially due to methodological differences. The 
aim of the paper is to carry out a broader analysis with longer time series and 
a more diverse set of indicators. The study divides countries of the world into 
21 developed "benchmark" countries and 156 developing countries. The distance 
between the benchmark and developing countries is measured using the "time lags" 
method, applied here to nine indicators covering topics such as the economy, 
health, education and the environment. The study further utilizes a 
probabilistic approach to extrapolate missing historical data for developing 
countries, so that the analysis can cover a full century starting in 1920 and 
ending with short-term projections to year 2020. The study finds that a majority 
of developing countries, and the population-weighted developing world as a 
whole, has reduced its lag in most indicators between 1920 and 2020. Progress 
was unevenly distributed, with East Asian and European countries converging the 
most with the benchmark, while most African countries have diverged along with 
some American ones. Catch-up in education attainment and life expectancy has 
been more successful than in infant survival rate, GDP per capita or technology 
adoption. The findings are put in context of United Nations' Sustainable 
Development Goals, showing how the time lag method could improve setting targets 
for some of the goals. Further, time lags are used to analyze the current 
demographic, economic and political situation of developing countries, 
identifying opportunities and risks for future catch-up with developed 
countries.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence on long-term effectiveness and cost effectiveness of 
treatment sequences for multiple myeloma (MM) is sparse. We used published data 
and country-specific data to assess the cost effectiveness of four-line 
treatment sequences for elderly transplant-ineligible patients with MM in 
Serbia.
METHOD: We developed a Markov cohort model to compare long-term effectiveness 
and cost effectiveness of five sequential MM treatment alternatives from the 
perspective of the national healthcare provider. Effectiveness parameters on 
progression, mortality and adverse events were extracted from published clinical 
trials. Costs were based on price lists of the National Health Insurance Fund. 
We compared life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
among alternative courses of action. The model was analyzed over a lifelong time 
horizon applying a 3% annual discount rate for effectiveness outcomes and costs. 
Robustness of the model was tested in multiple deterministic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The sequences were defined by the frontline treatment: MPT 
(melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide), MPV (melphalanprednisone-bortezomib), CTD 
(cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone), VCD 
(bortezomib-cyclophosphamidedexamethasone) and BP (bendamustine-prednisone). MPV 
sequence resulted in the highest remaining life expectancy (4.76 life years). 
Cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in three non-dominated strategies: MPT, 
VCD, and MPV sequences, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 
35,300 per life-year gained (LYG) for VCD and EUR 47,200/LYG for MPV relative to 
MPT.
CONCLUSION: MPV sequence was the most effective in terms of life expectancy for 
elderly transplant-ineligible MM patients in Serbia. Bortezomib-based strategies 
would be recommended for the frontline treatment of patients with MM in Serbia 
if the willingness-to-pay threshold is around EUR 35,000-60,000/LYG.

Publisher: UVOD: O dolgoročni uspešnosti in stroškovni učinkovitosti zaporedij 
zdravljenja multiplega mieloma (MM) ni veliko dokazov. Na podlagi objavljenih 
podatkov in podatkov za posamezne države smo ocenili stroškovno učinkovitost 
štirih zaporedij zdravljenja starejših bolnikov z MM, ki niso primerni za 
presaditev, v Srbiji.
METODA: Za primerjanje dolgoročne uspešnosti in stroškovne učinkovitosti petih 
alternativ zaporednega zdravljenja MM z vidika nacionalnega izvajalca 
zdravstvenega varstva smo razvili kohortni model Markova. Parametre uspešnosti 
glede napredovanja, umrljivosti in neželenih dogodkov smo pridobili iz 
objavljenih kliničnih preskušanj. Stroški temeljijo na cenikih nacionalnega 
sklada za zdravstveno zavarovanje. Med različnimi ukrepi smo primerjali 
pričakovano življenjsko dobo, stroške in mejno razmerje stroškovne 
učinkovitosti. Model smo analizirali v vseživljenjskem časovnem okviru, pri 
čemer smo za rezultate uspešnosti in stroške uporabili 3-odstotno letno 
diskontno stopnjo. Robustnost modela smo preizkusili z več determinističnimi 
analizami občutljivosti.
REZULTATI: Zaporedja so bila opredeljena z zdravljenjem v prvi liniji: MPT 
(melfalan-prednizon-talidomid), MPV (melfalanprednizon-bortezomib), CTD 
(ciklofosfamid-talidomid-deksametazon), VCD 
(bortezomib-ciklofosfamid-deksametazon) in BP (bendamustin-prednizon). Pri 
zaporedju MPV je bila pričakovana preostala življenjska doba najdaljša (4,76 
leta življenja). Pri analizi stroškovne učinkovitosti so bile ugotovljene tri 
neprevladujoče strategije: zaporedja MPT, VCD in MPV z mejnim razmerjem 
stroškovne učinkovitosti 35.300 EUR na pridobljeno leto življenja (LYG) za VCD 
in 47.200 EUR/LYG za MPV glede na MPT.
SKLEP: Zaporedje MPV je bilo najuspešnejše v smislu pričakovane življenjske dobe 
starejših bolnikov z MM, ki niso primerni za presaditev, v Srbiji. Strategije, 
ki temeljijo na bortezomibu, bi bile priporočljive za zdravljenje bolnikov z MM 
v prvi liniji v Srbiji, če je prag pripravljenosti na plačilo približno 
35.000–60.000 EUR/LYG.

Therapy for hemophilia has evolved in the last 40 years from plasma-based 
concentrates to recombinant proteins and, more recently, to non-factor 
therapeutics. Along this same timeline, research in adeno-associated viral (AAV) 
based gene therapy vectors has provided the framework for early phase clinical 
trials initially for hemophilia B (HB) and now for hemophilia A. Successive 
lessons learned from early HB trials have paved the way for current advanced 
phase trials. Nevertheless, questions linger regarding 1) the optimal balance of 
vector dose to transgene expression, 2) amount and durability of transgene 
expression required, and 3) long-term safety. Some trials have demonstrated 
unique findings not seen previously regarding transient elevation of liver 
enzymes, immunogenicity of the vector capsid, and loss of transgene expression. 
This review will provide an update on the clinical AAV gene therapy trials in 
hemophilia and address the questions above. A thoughtful and rationally 
approached expansion of gene therapy to the clinics would certainly be a welcome 
addition to the arsenal of options for hemophilia therapy. Further, the global 
impact of gene therapy could be vastly improved by expanding eligibility to 
different patient populations and to developing nations. With the advances made 
to date, it is possible to envision a shift from the early goal of simply 
increasing life expectancy to a significant improvement in quality of life by 
reduction in spontaneous bleeding episodes and disease complications.

Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) has a poor prognosis and is increasing in 
incidence. Although surgery, chemotherapy and other treatment modalities have 
improved, surgery remains the only potential curative treatment and is 
appropriate for only those few patients who present with localized, resectable 
disease. However, for the majority of patients, unresectable disease is evident 
at diagnosis and about 95% of patients die within 10 years, despite the majority 
receiving chemotherapy. Long-term survival is significantly greater for patients 
with resected BTC compared to those with unresectable disease. In unresected 
disease, life expectancy is limited, with first-line gemcitabine/cisplatin 
(GEM/CIS) accepted as standard of care. Currently no standard second-line 
regimen which provides significant improvement of clinical outcomes exists for 
those who present with refractory disease or who relapse after first-line 
treatment. Of particular importance is establishing the impact of best 
supportive care (BSC) as a benchmark for survival outcomes to which the impact 
of treatment modalities can be compared. Survival outcome often differs 
significantly for patients with different prognostic factor profiles even when 
receiving the same therapy so that it can be difficult to predict which patient 
subgroup might benefit most from which therapy. Therefore, the influence of 
prognostic factors on survival under different therapies as well as under BSC 
needs to be further assessed in order to arrive at truly evidence-based, best 
therapeutic decisions for individual patients. Encouraging new research into the 
genomic landscape of BTC may help to further subdivide the BTC population into 
molecular-genetic clusters likely to be sensitive to different targeted therapy 
approaches leading to further improvements in survival. Consequently, an unmet 
need exists not only to develop new and more effective therapies for this 
devastating disease, but also to integrate original research findings into a 
more complex, dynamic, individualized therapeutic decision model to aid 
clinicians in making evidence-based, best therapeutic decisions for individual 
patients.

Allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment of 
malignant and non-malignant hematological diseases. However, it is associated 
with several complications, such as graft-versus-host disease, and also various 
complications involving different organ systems. Late-onset non-infectious lung 
complication is one of them. This pathology may also affect the different 
anatomical regions in the lung as parenchymas, bronchi, or vessels and may 
manifest with different clinical presentations. Lung transplantation can be an 
effective treatment in patients with pulmonary complications after allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation and also in patients who do not respond to treatment 
adequately and with a limited life expectancy. Herein, we report two rare cases 
who underwent lung transplantation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
