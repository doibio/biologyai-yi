BACKGROUND: Tumour mutational burden (TMB) has been retrospectively correlated 
with response to immune checkpoint blockade. We prospectively explored the 
association of high tissue TMB (tTMB-high) with outcomes in ten 
tumour-type-specific cohorts from the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 study, which assessed 
the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab in patients with selected, 
previously treated, advanced solid tumours.
METHODS: In the multi-cohort, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 
study, patients were enrolled from 81 academic facilities and community-based 
institutions across 21 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. 
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a histologically or 
cytologically confirmed advanced (ie, unresectable or metastatic, or both) 
incurable solid tumour (eligible tumour types were anal, biliary, cervical, 
endometrial, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small-cell lung, thyroid, 
and vulvar), progression on or intolerance to one or more lines of standard 
therapy, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST; version 1.1) assessed by independent central radiological review, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy 
of at least 3 months, adequate organ function, and a tumour sample for biomarker 
analysis. Participants were given pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 
weeks for up to 35 cycles. Tissue TMB (tTMB) was assessed in formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tumour samples using the FoundationOne CDx assay (Foundation 
Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA). The prespecified definition of tTMB-high status 
was at least 10 mutations per megabase. The primary endpoint was the proportion 
of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) as per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (version 1.1) by independent 
central review. This prespecified analysis assessed the association between 
antitumour activity and tTMB in treated patients with evaluable tTMB data. 
Efficacy was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of 
pembrolizumab, had evaluable tTMB data, and were enrolled at least 26 weeks 
before data cutoff (June 27, 2019), and safety was assessed in all participants 
who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and had tTMB-high status. 
KEYNOTE-158 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02628067, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2016, and June 25, 2019, 1073 patients were enrolled. 
1066 participants were treated as of data cutoff (June 27, 2019), of whom 805 
(76%) were evaluable for TMB, and 105 (13%) of 805 had tTMB-high status and were 
assessed for safety. 1050 (98%) of 1066 patients enrolled by at least 26 weeks 
before data cutoff, of whom 790 (75%) were evaluable for TMB and included in 
efficacy analyses. 102 (13%) of these 790 patients had tTMB-high status (≥10 
mutations per megabase), and 688 (87%) patients had non-tTMB-high status (<10 
mutations per megabase). Median study follow-up was 37·1 months (IQR 35·0-38·3). 
Objective responses were observed in 30 (29%; 95% CI 21-39) of 102 patients in 
the tTMB-high group and 43 (6%; 5-8) of 688 in the non-tTMB-high group. 11 (10%) 
of 105 patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. 16 (15%) 
participants had a grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event, of which colitis 
was the only such adverse event that occurred in more than one patient (n=2). 
One patient had fatal pneumonia that was assessed by the investigator to be 
treatment related.
INTERPRETATION: tTMB-high status identifies a subgroup of patients who could 
have a robust tumour response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. tTMB could be a 
novel and useful predictive biomarker for response to pembrolizumab monotherapy 
in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic advanced solid 
tumours.

Drug discoveries can, when used appropriately, save lives. Since 1970, cancer 
death rates among people aged under 65 have halved in countries such as the USA 
and the UK. Despite pharmaceutical market imperfections and fears about the 
prices of new treatments, further progress should be possible during the 2020s. 
Anticancer medicine outlays account for 0.1-0.2% of the gross domestic product 
(GDP) of developed countries. Total cancer service spending typically stands at 
∼0.8% of GDP. The affordability of these sums is a political calculation. 
Improvements in the efficiency of drug development and global access to 
effective therapies are desirable. However, from a public interest perspective, 
these goals should not be pursued in ways that understate the value of better 
treatment outcomes and threaten the funding available for ongoing innovation.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the HIV population accounts for a large 
proportion of morbidity and mortality and, with the increased life expectancy, 
the burden of CVD is expected to rise. Inflammation, immune dysfunction, side 
effects of HIV medications, high prevalence of other risk factors are the likely 
pathogenic mechanisms for accelerated atherosclerosis. We aimed to evaluate the 
diagnostic yield of a cardiovascular multimodality diagnostic work-up in a 
contemporary cohort of HIV-infected patients. From November 2017 to October 
2019, HIV infected patients were screened in a cardiovascular diagnostic work-up 
program including clinical history, physical examination, arterial blood 
pressure measurement, 12-lead ECG, and Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE). 
Advanced non-invasive cardiovascular imaging tests, like Coronary Computed 
Tomography Angiography (CCTA), stress-echocardiography, Cardiac Magnetic 
Resonance (CMR), were performed in patients with suspicion of chronic coronary 
syndrome (CCS) or non-ischemic heart disease (NIHD). 117 HIV-infected 
consecutive patients underwent this cardiovascular diagnostic work-up and were 
included in our study. Fifty-two patients (45%) had evidence of CVD. Of them, 22 
presented Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), whereas 47 cases showed NIHD. In 17 
cases both conditions were present. Among patients with CAD, 8 showed critical 
coronary stenosis; among them, 5 were treated with percutaneous coronary 
intervention, 2 with Aorto-Coronary By-Pass Grafting (CABG), and one with 
medical therapy. Hypertension and diabetes were significantly associated with 
the development of CVD (respectively p<0.001 and p< 0.05), while current smoking 
(p<0.02) and hypertension (p<0.007) were positively associated to CAD. A 
comprehensive cardiovascular diagnostic work-up including advanced multimodality 
diagnostic imaging modalities led to early detection of CVD in nearly half of an 
HIV population with immediate interventions required in 6.8% of them, and 
aggressive prevention treatment started in the remaining HIV patients.

AIM: The aim was to explore the subjective health expectations (sHE) of patients 
with Crohn's disease (CD) for both the near future and the elderly.
METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was performed in four gastroenterology centres 
in Hungary. Consecutive outpatients with CD with age ≥ 18 were recruited. 
Socio-demographic and disease characteristics were recorded and the Crohn's 
Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Perianal Disease Activity Index, Patients' Global 
Assessment (PGA) and current pain visual analogue scale (VAS) were assessed. 
Subjective life expectancy (sLE) was explored and compared to statistical life 
expectancy. Current health and sHE for 1 year ahead and for ages 60/70/80/90 
were assessed using the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-3L.
RESULTS: In all, 206 patients (54.9% men) with a mean age of 34.7 (SD 
10.5 years) and disease duration of 10.5 (SD 6.3) years were studied. The CDAI 
score was 110.5 (SD 77.0) and 66% were treated by biologic drugs. Mean current 
EQ-5D-3L score was 0.80 (SD 0.17) and patients expected a 0.05 (SD 0.15) 
improvement within a year (P < 0.05). For ages 60/70/80/90, a mean EQ-5D-3L 
score of 0.59, 0.38, 0.10 and -0.12 respectively was provisioned. Age, current 
health status, sLE, PGA and pain VAS showed significant correlation with both 
1-year and older age sHE (P < 0.05). Long-term sHE and sLE were negatively 
affected by the presence of extraintestinal manifestations but not by previous 
CD-related surgery.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CD expect severe deterioration in health in later 
life. Given that unrealistic sHE may affect patients' current quality of life 
and health behaviour, we encourage physicians to explore and consider CD 
patients' sHE in clinical care.

BACKGROUND: occupational injuries in Italy are registered primarily by the 
Italian National Institute for insurance against accidents at work (Inail); its 
statistics show the number of events by consequence type (temporary, permanent, 
fatal). Data prior to 2001 include fatalities only if benefits were paid to 
survivors entitled to compensation, typically spouse and/or children.
OBJECTIVES: to estimate the number of fatal injuries occurred to workers without 
survivors entitled to compensation, not considered in INAIL statistics for the 
period 1951-2000; to evaluate years lived with disability (YLD) years of life 
lost (YLL), disability-adjusted life years (DALY) caused by all occupational 
injuries occurred in Italy, period 1951-2016.
DESIGN: evaluation of the stability of the ratio among fatal accidents with and 
without survivors, along the period of observation (2001-2017); retrospective 
application of such ratio to data related to the period 1951-2000; linkage of 
individual injury data to Global Burden of Disease injury categories and 
calculation of corresponding YLLs, YLDs, DALYs; calculation of mean values by 
main type of consequences (temporary, permanent, fatal); application of above 
means to Italian data 1951-2017.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: occupational injuries compensated by Inail in Italy, 
1951-2017.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: number of injuries, YLDs, YLLs, DALYs.
RESULTS: fatal occupational injuries, not considered in official statistics for 
the period 1951-2000, are estimated to be 26,218 cases, corresponding to 1.4 
millions of YLLs. In the same period, total occupational injuries (with 
temporary, permanent or fatal consequences) correspond to 11.5 millions of 
DALYs, fatal component corresponded to 5.1 millions of YLLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimated total number of fatal occupational injuries in 1951-2000 
is 28% higher than official Inail data. Considering YLLs, such increase rises up 
to 37%. Such difference reflects younger mean age and consequent longer life 
expectancy of workers without survivors. Considering DALYs, the increase is 14%. 
Throughout the period 1951-2017, a progressive reduction of the burden of injury 
is observed. At the same time a qualitative change is observed, with reduction 
from 55% to 30% of YLL/DALY ratio.

BACKGROUND: changing of life expectancy at birth (LE) over time is an important 
indicator of welfare and healthcare infrastructure of a Country.
OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the impact of age and cause-specific mortality on the 
change in LE in the Tuscany Region (Central Italy).
DESIGN: the decomposition of LE gain was realized with Pollard's method, using 
Epidat software.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: mortality data relative to residents that died during 
the period 1987-2015 were provided by the Tuscan Regional Mortality Registry. 
The analyzed causes of death were cardiovascular (CVS), respiratory (RESP), 
infective (INF) diseases and cancer (TUM).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: changing of LE expressed in years in relation to cause 
and age-specific mortality.
RESULTS: the overall LE gain was 6.5 years for males and 4.3 years for females, 
the major gain was observed in the age groups 65-89 years (for females 75-89 
years) and <1 year. The highest gain (2.6 years) was attributable to the 
reduction of mortality for CVS, followed by TUM (males: 1.42 vs females: 0.83) 
and RESP (males: 0.4 vs females: 0.1). The causes responsible for the loss of LE 
were INF (females: -0.16 vs males: -0.07) and lung cancer in females (-0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: the prompt treatment of acute CVS events and prevention (both 
primary and secondary) are responsible for the gain in LE. The reduction of 
mortality for TUM can be attributed to the evolution of diagnostic-therapeutic 
possibilities, but also to the implementation of the cancer screening 
programmes. Lung cancer was responsible for the loss of LE in Tuscan females; 
the targeted anti-smoke campaigns should, therefore, be intensified. The INF 
comported the loss of LE; explainable by diffusion of multi-drug resistant 
bacteria. The programmes of Hospital Infection Control and Antimicrobial 
Stewardship should be potentiated to contain the phenomenon.

BACKGROUND: A national endoscopic screening program for gastric cancer was 
rolled out in Japan in 2015. We used a microsimulation model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of current screening guidelines and alternative screening 
strategies in Japan.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model that simulated a virtual 
population corresponding to the Japanese population in risk factor profile and 
life expectancy. We evaluated 15 endoscopic screening scenarios with various 
starting ages, stopping ages, and screening intervals. The primary outcomes were 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. Cost-effective screening strategies were determined using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to explore model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Using the threshold of $50,000 per QALY, a triennial screening program 
for individuals aged 50 to 75 years was the cost-effective strategy, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45,665. Compared with no endoscopic 
screening, this strategy is predicted to prevent 63% of gastric cancer mortality 
and confer 27.2 QALYs gained per 1000 individuals over a lifetime period. 
Current screening guidelines were not on the cost-effectiveness efficient 
frontier. The results were robust on one-way sensitivity analyses and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study suggests that the endoscopic screening program 
in Japan would be cost-effective when implemented between age 50 and 75 years, 
with the screening repeated every 3 years. These findings underscore the need 
for further evaluation of the current gastric cancer screening recommendations.

OBJECTIVES: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a well-approved method for the 
treatment of end-stage osteoarthritis (OA). Due to rising life expectancy, 
elderly patients burdened with multimorbidity are subjected to THA. Some of 
these patients present significant depletion of physiological reserves, which is 
described as the frailty syndrome. This study aims to assess the influence of 
frailty on the THA outcomes in OA patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center observational study was conducted to 
investigate the effect of frailty measured by the modified frailty index-5 
(mFI-5) and modified frailty index-11 (mFI-11) on the long-term post-THA 
outcomes. The analysis included 597 initially screened patients subjected to 
unilateral, primary THA due to hip OA. The outcomes were assessed during a 
follow-up visit 3 years after THA. The primary outcome measures were 
patient-reported (the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index - WOMAC) and physician-reported scales (the Harris Hip Score - HHS). The 
secondary outcome measures were the length of hospital stay (LOS), pain 
complaints, complications, and satisfaction. A correlation analysis was 
performed (Spearman's R).
RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-five patients met the eligibility criteria, 
including 57.26% women (n = 209) and 42.74% men (n = 156). The mean age was 
65.11 ±12.12 years. Patients with high values of mFI-5 (r = 0.19; p < 0.05) and 
mFI-11 (r = 0.22; p < 0.01) achieved less satisfactory functional outcomes after 
THA (WOMAC). After age adjustment, mFI-11 (r = 0.17; p < 0.05) was a better 
predictor of functional outcome (WOMAC) than mFI-5 was (r = 0.15; p = 0.07). The 
mFI-5 (r = 0.25; p < 0.001) and mFI-11 (r = 0.29; p < 0.001) correlated with 
longer LOS.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified frailty index-5 (mFI-5) and modified frailty index-11 
(mFI-11) are useful tools to identify patients subjected to THA at a high risk 
of poor functioning after the procedure. They can be used in preoperative 
counseling before obtaining informed consent to support surgical 
decision-making. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the 
impact of the mFI on long-term postoperative functional results in OA treated 
with THA.

Li EW, Yeung D, Fuller S.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are 
now predominantly managed in an outpatient setting, with infrequent need for 
hospital-based therapy. New targeted oral treatments have transformed survival 
outcomes. An increasing number of patients now have a life expectancy 
approaching that of the general population. Suboptimal drug adherence is common 
and a key reason for therapy failure and poor clinical outcomes. The 
pharmacokinetics of new oral targeted drugs are significantly impacted by 
drug–drug interactions and an altered gastric pH. Long-term use of some of the 
new oral drugs is associated with complications, including cardiovascular events 
and infections, which can be fatal if not recognised.

AIM: Life expectancy and incidence of cancer among older adults are increasing. 
The aim of this study was to assess whether routinely used nursing screening 
tools can predict surgical outcomes in older adults with colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Data of patients who underwent elective colorectal cancer surgery at 
Rabin Medical Center during the years 2014-2016 were collected retrospectively. 
Patients were divided into study group (age 80-89 y), and control group (age 
60-69 y) for comparing surgical outcomes and six-month mortality. In the study 
group, screening tool scores were evaluated as potential predictors of surgical 
outcomes. These included Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), Admission 
Norton Scale Scores (ANSS), Morse Fall Scale (MFS), and Charlson Co-morbidity 
Index (CCI).
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 77 patients, and the control group 
consisted of 129 patients. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were similar in 
both groups. Nursing screening tools did not predict immediate postoperative 
outcomes in the study group. MUST and CCI were predictors for six-month 
mortality. CCI score was 9.43±2.44 in those who died within six months from 
surgery compared to 7.07 ±1.61 in those who were alive after six months 
(p<0.05). Post-operative complications were not associated with increased 30-day 
mortality. Advanced grade complications were associated with an increased 
six-month mortality (RR=1.37, 95% CI 0.95-1.98, p=0.013).
CONCLUSION: Different screening tools for high-risk older adults who are 
candidates for surgery have been developed, with the caveat of necessitating 
skilled physicians and resources such as time. Routinely used nursing screening 
tools may be helpful in better patient selection and informed decision making. 
These tools, specifically MUST and CCI who were found to predict six-month 
survival, can be used to additionally identify high-risk patients by the nursing 
staff and promote further evaluation. This can be a valuable tool in 
multidisciplinary and patient-centered care.

Brain metastases are significant causes of morbidity or mortality for patients 
with metastatic cancer. With the application of novel systematic therapy and 
improvement of overall survival, the prevalence of brain metastases is 
increasing. The paradigm of treatment for brain metastases evolved rapidly 
during the last 30 years due to the development of technology and emergence of 
novel therapy. Brain metastases used to be regarded as the terminal stage of 
cancer and left life expectancy to only 1 month. The application of whole brain 
radiotherapy for patients with brain metastases increased the life expectancy to 
4-6 months in the 1980s. Following studies established surgical resection 
followed by the application of whole brain radiotherapy the standard treatment 
for patients with single metastasis and good systematic performance. With the 
development of stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole 
brain radiotherapy provides an alternative modality with superior neurocognitive 
protection at the cost of overall survival. In addition, stereotactic 
radiosurgery combined with whole brain radiotherapy may offer a promising 
modality for patients with numerous multiple brain metastases who are not 
eligible for surgical resection. With the advancing understanding of molecular 
pathway and biological behavior of oncogenesis and tumor metastasis, novel 
targeted therapy including tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy are 
applied to brain metastases. Clinical trials had revealed the efficacy of 
targeted therapy. Furthermore, the combination of targeted therapy and 
radiotherapy or chemotherapy is the highlight of current investigation. 
Advancement in this area may further change the treatment paradigm and offer 
better modality for patients who are not suitable for surgical resection or 
radiosurgery.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is an essential mechanism governing normal development in 
humans. Although most DNAm patterns in blood cells are established in utero, the 
genes associated with immune function undergo postnatal DNAm modifications, and 
the characterization of this subset of genes is incomplete. Accordingly, we used 
available longitudinal DNAm datasets from a large birth cohort in the U.S. to 
further identify postnatal DNAm variation in peripheral leukocytes from 105 
children (n = 105) between birth and the first two years of life, as determined 
by postnatal changes in β values (with the percentage of methylation ranging 
from 0 to 1.0 at individual CpG sites). Our study is an extension of a previous 
analysis performed by our group and identified that: (1) as previously 
described, DNAm patterns at most CpG sites were established before birth and 
only a small group of genes underwent DNAm modifications postnatally, (2) this 
subset includes multiple immune genes critical for lymphocyte development, and 
(3) several members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor and cytokine 
superfamilies with essential roles in immune cell activation, survival, and 
lymphoid tissue development were among those with a larger postnatal variation. 
This study describes the precise epigenetic DNA methylation marks in important 
immune genes that change postnatally and raises relevant questions about the 
role of DNAm during postnatal immune development in early childhood.

BACKGROUND: Statin medications reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD). China's new central government medicine procurement policy 
lowered statin prices by five-fold or more, which may impact the 
cost-effectiveness of statin therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of China's 2019 centralized medicine 
procurement policy on the cost-effectiveness of statins treatment for primary 
ASCVD prevention.
METHODS: A microsimulation decision tree analytic model was built using 
individual participant data from ASCVD-free adults aged 35-64 years (n = 21,265) 
in the China Multi-provincial Cohort Study. ASCVD incidence, costs (2019 Int$), 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year period from health-care 
sector and societal perspectives were estimated. Effect and cost-effectiveness 
of low-dose statins (equivalent potency regimens of simvastatin 20 mg/day, 
atorvastatin 10 mg/day, or rosuvastatin 5 mg/day) and moderate-dose (double low 
dose) statins therapy were simulated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of statin treatment was compared with no treatment by category of 10-year 
ASCVD risk. New lower prices of statins were from the centralized procurement 
policy bid-winning announcement file. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses quantified model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Low-dose statins interventions reduced 10-year ASCVD incidence by 4.1%, 
9.7%, and 15.5% among people with low, moderate, and high risk comparing to no 
treatment. Lowering statin prices to the 2019 central government procurement 
policy level could lower the ICER of low-dose statins treatment for high-risk 
people from Int$ 141,000 to Int$ 51,300 per QALY gained from health-care sector 
perspective. Moderate-dose statin treatment lowered the ICER compared with the 
low-dose statins treatment in each ASCVD risk category (Int$ 43,100 vs. Int$ 
51,300 per QALY gained from the health-care sector perspective for high risk 
people). Cost-effectiveness improved progressively with increased baseline ASCVD 
risk.
CONCLUSION: Implementing low central government prices will substantially 
improve the cost-effectiveness of statins for primary ASCVD prevention in 
35-64-year-old Chinese adults.

Various assistive devices like exoskeletons have been developed to aid the 
growing number of disabled people. Recent studies have started to explore using 
soft rather than rigid components to create lightweight and unobtrusive systems 
that can be more easily adopted by the general population. However, there is a 
tradeoff between compliance and power in these systems. We investigated the 
physiological benefits of using an inconspicuous, soft and passive assistive 
device which would avoid bulkiness, heaviness and user discomfort. We chose to 
assist the sit-to-stand (STS) maneuver because it is a common activity of daily 
living (ADL). STS is also recognized as one of the most challenging ADLs due to 
the high knee torque required, and the primary limiting factor is known to be 
knee extensor strength. Thus, the objective of this research was to develop and 
evaluate an unobtrusive knee assist wear called X-tights that could aid knee 
extension during STS using only soft and passive components. This was 
accomplished by routing elastic bands across the lower extremity. Thirty-one 
healthy participants performed STS tests with and without the X-tights, while 
metabolic cost and muscle activity were recorded. Metabolic power significantly 
decreased, by 3.2 ± 1.5% (P = 0.04), when utilizing the X-tights during the STS, 
while there was no statistically significant differences in muscle activity. The 
present work introduces a new soft and passive assist wear that can be worn 
inconspicuously under normal clothing, and we demonstrate promising results for 
the future development and integration of soft assistive technology for daily 
life.

Over the recent years, Atractomorpha sinensis I. Bolivar, has emerged as an 
important agricultural pest in China. However, the biological characteristics of 
A. sinensis remain largely unknown, which can hinder the prediction of its 
population dynamics. Thus, understanding the impact of temperature on the 
developmental period of A. sinensis is crucial to predict its population 
dynamics. The biological characteristics of A. sinensis were systematically 
observed at five different temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, and 32°C) using the 
age-stage, two-sex life table method. The results demonstrated that the 
developmental period, preadult time, adult longevity, adult preoviposition 
period, and total preoviposition period were significantly reduced when the 
temperature was elevated from 16 to 32°C. The developmental threshold 
temperatures of egg, nymph, preoviposition period, female adult, male adult, and 
generation were 9.14, 10.44, 12.53, 10.97, 12.47, and 10.58°C, respectively, 
with the corresponding effective accumulated temperatures of 452.31, 575.99, 
169.58, 528.13, 340.81, and 1447.95 degree-days. With an increase in 
temperature, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (λ) 
were increased, while the mean generation time (T) was shortened. The optimal 
values of net reproductive rate (R0= 73.00 offspring) and fecundity (244.55 
eggs) were determined at 24°C. Similarly, the population trend index (I) of A. 
sinensis was found to be highest at 24°C. Our findings indicate that A. sinensis 
has the greatest rate of population growth at 24°C, which can provide a 
scientific basis for predicting the in-field population dynamics of A. sinensis.

The purpose of this investigation was, firstly, to quantify the test-retest 
reliability of strength measures in adolescent distance runners; and secondly, 
to explore the relationships between inter-limb strength asymmetry and 
performance and running economy (RE) in a similar cohort of young runners. For 
the reliability study, twelve (n = 6 female) post-pubertal adolescent distance 
runners performed an isometric quarter-squat on a dual force plate and 
unilateral isometric hip extension and hip abduction tests on two occasions. For 
the correlation study, participants (n = 31) performed the strength tests plus a 
submaximal incremental running assessment and a maximal running test. Running 
economy was expressed as the average energy cost of running for all speeds below 
lactate turnpoint and was scaled for body mass using a previously calculated 
power exponent. Allometrically scaled peak force during the quarter-squat and 
peak torque in the hip strength tasks showed acceptable levels of 
reproducibility (typical error ≤6.3%). Relationships between strength asymmetry 
and performance and RE were low or negligible (r < 0.47, p > 0.05), except for 
hip abduction strength asymmetry and RE in the female participants (r = 0.85, p 
< 0.001, n = 16). Practitioners should consider inter-limb hip abduction 
strength asymmetry on an individual level, and attempting to reduce this 
asymmetry in females may positively impact RE.

Healthspan science aims to add healthy, functional years to human life. Many 
different methods of improving healthspan have been investigated, chiefly 
focusing on just one aspect of an organism's health such as survival. Studies in 
Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated that a reversal to a long-abandoned 
ancestral diet results in improved functional health, particularly at later 
ages. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical studies have demonstrated that botanical 
extracts have potent antiaging properties, capable of extending the mean 
lifespan of D. melanogaster by up to 25%, without a decrease in early fecundity. 
In this study, we combine these two different approaches to healthspan extension 
to examine whether a combination of such treatments results in a synergistic or 
antagonistic effect on Drosophila healthspan. One botanical extract, derived 
from Rhodiola rosea, mimicked the effects of the ancestral apple diet with 
better performance at later ages compared with the control. Another extract, 
derived from Rosa damascena, decreased age-specific survivorship when combined 
with the apple diet providing support for the "Poisoned Chalice" hypothesis that 
combinations of various supplements or diets can elicit adverse physiological 
responses. More experiments in model organisms should be completed researching 
the effects of combining healthspan-extending substances in various diet 
backgrounds.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that there may be a sex-specific 
biological risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with autosomal 
dominant AD due to a mutation (E280A) in Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) are genetically 
determined to develop early-onset dementia and thus, have few age-related risk 
factors for AD that are known to vary by sex (i.e., cardiovascular disease, 
menopause, life expectancy).
OBJECTIVE: Investigate sex differences in markers of cognition and 
neurodegeneration in autosomal dominant AD.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 19 cognitively-unimpaired PSEN1 
mutation carriers (age range 20-44; 11 females), 11 symptomatic carriers (age 
range 42-56; 8 females), and 23 matched non-carriers family members (age range 
20-50; 13 females). We examined hippocampal volume ratio, CERAD Total Score, and 
CERAD Word List (i.e., Learning, Delayed Recall, and Recognition). Mann-Whitney 
U tests, Spearman correlations and regression models were conducted.
RESULTS: There were no differential associations between age, CERAD Total Score, 
CERAD Word List-Learning, Delayed Recall, Recognition, and hippocampal volume 
ratio in male and female carriers and non-carriers. Cognitively-unimpaired 
female carriers showed better CERAD Total scores and CERAD Word List-Learning 
than cognitively-unimpaired male carriers, despite having similar hippocampal 
volume ratios. The interaction of sex and hippocampal volume ratio did not 
predict cognitive performance across groups.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest that cognitively-unimpaired female 
carriers showed a verbal memory reserve, and as disease progresses, female 
carriers did not exhibit a cognitive susceptibility to AD-related 
neurodegeneration. Future studies with larger samples of autosomal dominant AD 
are warranted to further understand sex differences in AD-related clinical and 
pathological markers.

BACKGROUND: SMA1 natural history is characterized by early development of 
chronic respiratory failure. Respiratory interventions in type 1 SMA infants are 
subject to great practice variability. Nusinersen, has been recently approved in 
Argentina. The advent of novel treatments has highlighted the need for natural 
history studies reporting disease progression in type 1 SMA.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the progression, respiratory interventions and survival 
based on the type of respiratory support in type 1SMA patients, in a third level 
pediatric hospital in Argentina.
METHODS: Cohort of SMA1 patients followed at the Interdisciplinary Program for 
the Study and Care of Neuromuscular Patients (IPNM). Patient survival was 
analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was performed to 
compare the survival curve for three respiratory intervention groups.
RESULTS: 59 patients. Mean age of symptom onset was 2.19 (±1.4) months, age at 
diagnosis was 3.9 (±2.1) months. Patients developed respiratory failure at 5.82 
months (±2.32) and 13.8 months (±5.6) in Type 1B and Type 1C, respectively
