selecting only appropriate proteins for biotinylation. Selective, potent 
inhibition of these three BPLs was demonstrated despite sequence and structural 
homology. This highlights the potential for targeting BPL for novel, selective 
antifungal therapies against B. cinerea, Z. tritici and other fungal species.

Low Impact Developments (LIDs) employ a series of vegetative techniques to 
retain rainfall close to the site of origin. Although LIDs offer sustainable 
runoff management, these infrastructures can be considered a risk to public 
health due to the presence of pathogens in the runoff and human exposure to 
contaminated water held in and transported by LIDs. The objective of this study 
is to examine the disease burden of Gastrointestinal illness (GI) from exposure 
to LIDs at the residential, neighbourhood, and municipal levels. The authors 
conducted a meta-analysis of literature on three water features: (1) harvested 
rainwater obtained from LIDs, (2) surface water, and (3) floodwater. A set of 32 
studies were systematically selected to collect values of risks of infection and 
expressed as the disease burden, i.e. disability adjusted life years (DALYs). 
The results showed that the percentage of GI illness exceeding the health 
guidelines were high for harvested rainwater, i.e. 22% of annual disease burden 
exceeded the WHO guidelines (0.001 DALYs/1000 persons), and 2% exceeded the US 
EPA guidelines (5.75 DALYs/1000 bathers). Among the six exposures for harvested 
rainwater, exposure to spray irrigation, exceeded US EPA guidelines whereas; 
five exposures, i.e. flushing, hosing, daily shower, spray irrigation, and 
children playing, surpassed the WHO guidelines. Considering LID treatment, the 
values of annual disease burden from all the selected barriers were below US EPA 
guidelines however, these values exceeded the WHO guidelines for three barriers 
i.e. water plaza, grass swale, and open storage ponds. These findings provide a 
broader perspective of the disease burden associated with LIDs and emphasise to 
consider the type of exposures and required treatment barriers for developing 
LID infrastructures in urban areas.

Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is a key α-kinase that negatively 
regulates the extension step of protein synthesis, which consumes most of the 
energy and amino acids required for protein synthesis. Studies have found that 
eEF2K protein is related to the breast cancer. However, existing inhibitor 
effect has not achieved the desired effect in cancer therapy. Proteolysis target 
chimeric (PROTAC) technology is uses proteasome to degrade target protein to 
achieve the purpose of inhibiting tumour cell growth. Here, we reported that the 
use of PROTAC strategy in combining with star eEF2K inhibitor A484954 and its 
potential derivatives. Consequently, candidate compound 11l was found to degrade 
eEF2K and induce apoptosis in human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, 
these findings demonstrate that our eEF2K-targeting PROTAC small molecule would 
be a potential new strategy for future breast cancer therapy.

OBJECTIVES: The global patterns of cancer incidences and mortality rates are 
slowly shifting towards low- and middle-income countries. Through our article, 
we highlight the societal cost associated with premature mortality and morbidity 
of cancer in Nepal. The monetary loss is indicative of the severity of the issue 
and it serves to motivate the policymakers realize the urgency in devising 
appropriate cancer control strategies.
STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a cross-sectional study using the GLOBOCAN 
2012 data.
METHODS: Using the human capital approach, we measure the number of years of 
life lost (YLL) and the number of years of productive life lost (YPLL) due to 
cancer in Nepal.
RESULTS: We found that following diagnosis, a Nepali patient with cancer is 
likely to lose out on 19.64 years of their life; the average number of YLL is 
higher for females (22.2 years vs 16.8 years in males). After adjusting for 
labor force participation rate and predicted growth rate of the economy, we 
found that cancer led to a total productivity loss of $149 million (males) and 
$121 million (females) in 2012. The burden of the top five cancers accounted for 
almost half of the total productivity loss in both the genders. Cervical and 
lung cancer incur the maximum cost to society, respectively, for females and 
males.
CONCLUSIONS: The article highlighted the severity of the cancer issue and 
emphasized the urgency needed in devising cancer control policies in Nepal.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a chronic autosomal recessive disease caused by defects 
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Cystic 
Fibrosis affects multiple organs but progressive remodeling of the airways, 
mucus accumulation, and chronic inflammation in the lung, result in lung disease 
as the major cause of morbidity and mortality. While advances in management of 
CF symptoms have increased the life expectancy of this devastating disease, and 
there is tremendous excitement about the potential of new agents targeting the 
CFTR molecule itself, there is still no curative treatment. With the recent 
advances in the identification of endogenous airway progenitor cells and in 
directed differentiation of pluripotent cell sources, cell-based therapeutic 
approaches for CF have become a plausible treatment method with the potential to 
ultimately cure the disease. In this review, we highlight the current state of 
cell therapy in the CF field focusing on the relevant autologous and allogeneic 
cell populations under investigation and the challenges associated with their 
use. In addition, we present advances in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell 
approaches and emerging new genetic engineering methods, which have the capacity 
to overcome the current limitations hindering cell therapy approaches.

BACKGROUND: Despite a long average lifespan, increased life expectancy does not 
guarantee higher quality of life.
METHODS: To contribute in understanding some determinants of healthy life 
expectancies in older Japanese individuals in a snowy winter region, we 
investigated the indicators of health. Local residents (n = 124) in the city of 
Iwamizawa volunteered for health examinations from January 2016 to March 2016. 
We recorded activity via daily steps for 2-week periods. In addition, we 
measured body composition, grip strength, and assessed nutritional status.
RESULTS: Analysis of body composition and daily activity indicated that women 
who walked more than 4000 steps had lower fat mass and increased muscle mass. 
Men with >3.0 metabolic equivalents (METs) when walking had lower body fat.
CONCLUSION: For healthy older Japanese individuals in this snowy winter region, 
walking >4000 steps daily for women and exercise of >3.0 METs for men may 
indicate health-promoting activities.

Perceiving personality through the grapevine: A network approach to reputations.

Costello CK(1), Srivastava S(1).

Author information:

Reputations are critical in human social life: they allow people to share and 
act on information about one another, even when they have never met. Reputations 
can be conceptualized as information about a target person that is stored in 
networks of perceivers and transmitted through either direct interaction or 
hearsay. We present a novel paradigm that integrates the network approach with 
interpersonal perception research. We apply that paradigm to study the 
consensus, accuracy, positivity bias, and consequences of personality trait 
information in hearsay-based reputations. In 2 preregistered studies (N = 260 
and 369), we created naturalistic micronetworks in the lab in which participants 
interacted and got to know one another, then later described each other to naïve 
third parties. Across studies, we use the extended Social Accuracy Model 
(Wessels, Zimmermann, Biesanz, & Leising, 2020) and an extension of the 
domain-wise correlational approach (Kenny, 1994). Hearsay-based reputations are 
about as positively biased as direct reputations. They showed strong consensus 
(agreement) with direct reputations and modest accuracy, suggesting that they 
can consolidate around an inaccurate representation. Perceivers' extraversion 
was associated with more biased hearsay reputations. Experimentally manipulating 
the context of the hearsay exchange had no detectable impact on hearsay 
consensus or accuracy. Hearsay reputations were consequential, affecting the 
extent to which perceivers thought targets would be good leaders or friends. 
These results provide initial insights into reputation networks and suggest 
several important future directions for the network approach to reputations. We 
also present open materials and data analysis software for others to extend the 
reputations-as-networks approach. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all

BACKGROUND: Access to oxytocin for prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in 
resource-poor settings is limited by the requirement for a consistent cold chain 
and for a skilled attendant to administer the injection. To overcome these 
barriers, heat-stable, non-injectable formulations of oxytocin are under 
development, including oxytocin for inhalation. This study modelled the 
cost-effectiveness of an inhaled oxytocin product (IHO) in Bangladesh and 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of IHO for the prevention of PPH compared to the standard of 
care in Bangladesh and Ethiopia. In Bangladesh, introduction of IHO was modelled 
in all public facilities and home deliveries with or without a skilled 
attendant. In Ethiopia, IHO was modelled in all public facilities and home 
deliveries with health extension workers. Costs (costs of introduction, PPH 
prevention and PPH treatment) and effects (PPH cases averted, deaths averted) 
were modelled over a 12-month program. Life years gained were modelled over a 
lifetime horizon (discounted at 3%). Cost of maintaining the cold chain or 
effects of compromised oxytocin quality (in the absence of a cold chain) were 
not modelled.
RESULTS: In Bangladesh, IHO was estimated to avert 18,644 cases of PPH, 76 
maternal deaths and 1954 maternal life years lost. This also yielded a 
cost-saving, with the majority of gains occurring among home deliveries where 
IHO would replace misoprostol. In Ethiopia, IHO averted 3111 PPH cases, 30 
maternal deaths and 767 maternal life years lost. The full IHO introduction 
program bears an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of between 2 and 3 
times the per-capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ($1880 USD per maternal life 
year lost) and thus is unlikely to be considered cost-effective in Ethiopia. 
However, the ICER of routine IHO administration considering recurring cost alone 
falls under 25% of per-capita GDP ($175 USD per maternal life-year saved).
CONCLUSIONS: IHO has the potential to expand access to uterotonics and reduce 
PPH-associated morbidity and mortality in high burden settings. This can 
facilitate reduced spending on PPH management, making the product highly 
cost-effective in settings where coverage of institutional delivery is lagging.

OBJECTIVE: Identify the most recent utility value estimates for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) via systematic literature review (SLR) and explore trends in 
utility elicitation methods in the last 6 years.
METHODS: This SLR was updated on January 25, 2018, and identified studies 
reporting utilities for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, angina, peripheral 
artery disease (PAD), and any-cause revascularization by searching Embase, 
PubMed, Health Technology Assessment Database, and grey literature.
RESULTS: A total of 375 studies reported CVD utilities (pre-2013 vs post-2013: 
MI, 38 vs 32; stroke, 86 vs 113; stable angina, 8 vs 9; undefined/unstable 
angina, 23 vs 8; PAD, 29 vs 13; revascularization, 54 vs 40). Median average 
utilities for MI, stroke, and revascularization increased over time (pre-2013 vs 
post-2013: MI, 0.71 vs 0.79; stroke, 0.63 vs 0.64; revascularization, 0.76 vs 
0.81); angina and PAD showed a decrease in median values over time (stable 
angina, 0.83 vs 0.72; undefined/unstable angina, 0.70 vs 0.69; PAD, 0.76 vs 
0.71). The proportion of utility estimates from trials increased across health 
states (pre-2013 vs post-2013: 22.5% vs 37.2%), as did the proportion of trials 
using the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D; pre-2013 vs post-2013: 
73.8% vs 91.4%). Use of methods such as the standard gamble, time trade-off, and 
Health Utilities Index has declined.
CONCLUSIONS: Health state utilities for cardiovascular health states have 
changed in the last 6 years, likely due to changes in the types of studies 
conducted, the patient populations evaluated, and possibly changing utility 
elicitation methods. The EQ-5D has been used more frequently.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy leads to higher hospitalisation 
rates in elderly patients. The aim of this work is to study the characteristics 
of the population over 90 years of age that are admitted due to acute kidney 
injury (AKI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted that included all 
patients admitted to hospital with AKI in the years 2013 and 2014. 
Epidemiological characteristics, comorbidity, medication and baseline analytical 
data were collected, and a comparison was made between patients with age over 90 
years-old and the others.
RESULTS: A total of 1733 patients were included, of whom 264 (15%) were over 90 
years-old. A significantly higher proportion of these patients were women. The 
most frequent cause of AKI in patients older than 90 years was functional (81%) 
(p < 0.001 compared to other age groups). The main cause of hospital admission 
was infection. In the group of over 90 years of age, a higher prevalence was 
found for arterial hypertension (p = 0.005), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.014), 
congestive heart failure (p = 0.006), and cognitive impairment (p < 0.0001). The 
baseline glomerular filtration rate by CKD-EPI was lower in the group of 
patients older than 90 years (p < 0.0001). Patients under 90 years admitted to 
hospital due to AKI, had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), 
dyslipidaemia (p < 0.001), history of neoplasia (p < 0.001), and a higher 
Barthel index (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonagenarians admitted due to AKI have functional aetiology as the 
most common factor. These patients have a higher prevalence of hypertension, 
heart failure, chronic kidney disease, low functional status, and more cognitive 
impairment.

PURPOSE: The functional use of the upper extremities in daily living activities 
has become important in the later ages with the increasing life expectancy of 
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study aimed to assess 
manual ability and upper limb performance of nonambulatory children with DMD, 
and to determine their relationship with factors that might affect ability and 
performance.
METHODS: Manual ability was determined via the ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire and 
upper limb performance was assessed with the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) 
test. Possible related factors such as functional level, steroid usage, upper 
limb range of motion (ROM), thumb opposition, upper limb muscular strength, and 
grip strength were evaluated. Correlations of related factors with manual 
ability and upper limb performance were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age of 23 nonambulatory DMD children was 13.04±1.39 years. 
Moderate impairments were determined according to the ABILHAND-Kids and PUL, 
with scores of 26.30±10.74 and 46.22±15.02, respectively. The functional level, 
steroid usage, duration of wheelchair use, upper extremity ROM, and global upper 
limb muscle strength of children were weak-to-strongly correlated with at least 
one score of ABILHAND-Kids and PUL (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Children with DMD may already have severe proximal and mid-level 
upper extremity involvement, even reflected in distal functions, at the time 
when they progress to the nonambulatory stage. Besides muscular strength, many 
related factors should be taken into account for therapists to assess and treat 
upper limb performance at later stages of DMD.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality globally. With advances in early diagnosis and treatment of CVD and 
increasing life expectancy, more people are surviving initial CVD events. 
However, models for stratifying disease severity risk in patients with 
established CVD for effective secondary prevention strategies are inadequate. 
Multivariable prognostic models to stratify CVD risk may allow personalised 
treatment interventions. This review aims to systematically review the existing 
multivariable prognostic models for the recurrence of CVD or major adverse 
cardiovascular events in adults with established CVD diagnosis.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Bibliographic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO 
and Web of Science) will be searched, from database inception to April 2020, 
using terms relating to the clinical area and prognosis. A hand search of the 
reference lists of included studies will also be done to identify additional 
published studies. No restrictions on language of publications will be applied. 
Eligible studies present multivariable models (derived or validated) of adults 
(aged 16 years and over) with an established diagnosis of CVD, reporting at 
least one of the components of the primary outcome of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (defined as either coronary heart disease, stroke, 
peripheral artery disease, heart failure or CVD-related mortality). Reviewing 
will be done by two reviewers independently using the pre-defined criteria. Data 
will be extracted for included full-text articles. Risk of bias will be assessed 
using the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). 
Prognostic models will be summarised narratively. If a model is tested in 
multiple validation studies, the predictive performance will be summarised using 
a random-effects meta-analysis model to account for any between-study 
heterogeneity.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required. The results of this 
study will be submitted to relevant conferences for presentation and a 
peer-reviewed journal for publication.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical pictures, laboratory tests and imaging of 
patients with lung involvement, either from severe COVID-19 or macrophage 
activation syndrome (MAS), in order to assess how similar these two diseases 
are.
METHODS: The present work has been designed as a cross-sectional single-centre 
study to compare characteristics of patients with lung involvement either from 
MAS or severe COVID-19. Chest CT scans were assessed by using an artificial 
intelligence (AI)-based software.
RESULTS: Ten patients with MAS and 47 patients with severe COVID-19 with lung 
involvement were assessed. Although all patients showed fever and dyspnoea, 
patients with MAS were characterised by thrombocytopaenia, whereas patients with 
severe COVID-19 were characterised by lymphopaenia and neutrophilia. Higher 
values of H-score characterised patients with MAS when compared with severe 
COVID-19. AI-reconstructed images of chest CT scan showed that apical, basal, 
peripheral and bilateral distributions of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), as well 
as apical consolidations, were more represented in severe COVID-19 than in MAS. 
C reactive protein directly correlated with GGOs extension in both diseases. 
Furthermore, lymphopaenia inversely correlated with GGOs extension in severe 
COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data could suggest laboratory and radiological differences 
between MAS and severe COVID-19, paving the way for further hypotheses to be 
investigated in future confirmatory studies.

The protein composition and structure of assembling 60S ribosomal subunits 
undergo numerous changes as pre-ribosomes transition from the nucleolus to the 
nucleoplasm. This includes stable anchoring of the Rpf2 subcomplex containing 5S 
rRNA, rpL5, rpL11, Rpf2 and Rrs1, which initially docks onto the flexible domain 
V of rRNA at earlier stages of assembly. In this work, we tested the function of 
the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpf2 during these anchoring steps, by truncating 
this extension and assaying effects on middle stages of subunit maturation. The 
rpf2Δ255-344 mutation affects proper folding of rRNA helices H68-70 during 
anchoring of the Rpf2 subcomplex. In addition, several assembly factors (AFs) 
are absent from pre-ribosomes or in altered conformations. Consequently, major 
remodeling events fail to occur: rotation of the 5S RNP, maturation of the 
peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel 
(NPET), and export of assembling subunits to the cytoplasm.

Descriptive epidemiology of incidence and mortality of primary liver cancer in 
185 countries: evidence from GLOBOCAN 2018.

University, Delhi, India.

PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the burden of primary liver cancer in 185 
countries in 2018.
METHODS: The estimates of incidence, mortality and prevalence of primary liver 
cancer were procured from GLOBOCAN 2018. The development status of a country was 
measured using the human development index-a composite indicator of income per 
capita, education and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Globally, primary liver cancer resulted in an estimated 781 631 deaths 
at age-standardized mortality rate of 8.5/100 000, and 841 080 cases were 
estimated to be diagnosed in 2018. Males accounted for 596 574 cases and 548 375 
deaths, which is more than twice the burden of primary liver cancer in females 
(cases: 244 506; deaths: 233 456). The global age-standardized incidence rate 
was 9.3/100 000 in 2018, varying from Morocco (1.1/100 000) to Mongolia 
(93.7/100 000). There were remarkable variations in terms of age-standardized 
mortality rate, too, which ranged from 1/100 000 in Nepal to 75.4/100 000 in 
Mongolia. East Asia was the top region contributing 55.6% of global cases and 
54.7% of global deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Since majority of the primary liver cancer burden pertains to 
hepatocellular carcinoma and screening approaches are yet to be fully proven, 
the policy focus must be on prevention approaches through the hepatitis-B 
vaccine, early detection of hepatitis-C infection, reduced alcohol consumption, 
obesity control, reduced aflatoxin exposure and containment of other modifiable 
risk factors.

PURPOSE: To identify age-related changes and the relationship between upper and 
lower cervical sagittal alignment and the range of motion (ROM).
METHODS: A total of 600 asymptomatic volunteers were enrolled. There were 50 
males and 50 females in each decade of life between the third and the eighth. 
The O-C2 angle and the C2-7 angle were measured using the neutral radiographs of 
the cervical spine. ROM was assessed by measuring the difference in alignment in 
the neutral, flexion, and extension positions.
RESULTS: The mean O-C2 angle in the neutral position was 14.0° lordotic. The 
mean ROM of the O-C2 angle was 23.1°. The mean C2-7 angle in the neutral 
position was 14.3° lordotic. The mean ROM of the C2-7 angle was 56.0°. The O-C2 
angle was 16.1° in the third decade and gradually decreased to 11.4° in the 
eighth decade. There were no significant age-related changes in the ROM of the 
O-C2 angle. The C2-7 angle was 7.2° in the third decade and gradually increased 
to 20.8° in the eighth decade, and the ROM gradually decreased with increasing 
age. Significant negative correlation was observed between O-C2 angle and C2-7 
angle.
CONCLUSION: The O-C2 angle gradually decreased and the C2-7 angle increased with 
age. The ROM of the O-C2 angle did not change, but the ROM of the C2-7 angle 
decreased with age. The upper and lower cervical spine showed different 
age-related changes.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy causes higher prevalence of chronic 
diseases and greater frailty among older persons. Osteoarthritis and hip 
fracture are the leading causes of disability among the older persons in high 
income countries. Recent studies showed that patients undergoing hip fracture 
surgery have an increased risk of mortality and developing complications. The 
aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of in-hospital mortality events, 
complications, and 30-hospital readmissions among patients undergoing hip 
fracture surgery (HFS) and elective hip replacement (EHR).
METHODS: The study considered all hospital admissions for HFS and EHR performed 
from 2006 to 2015 in Abruzzo region, Italy. Data were collected from hospital 
discharge records. To compare outcomes between HFS and EHR, a propensity score 
matching procedure was performed. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for 
primary and secondary outcomes were computed using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 32,248 patients were selected: 23,075 underwent HFS and 9173 
underwent EHR. After matching, 18,078 patients were included in the analyses 
(9039 patients who underwent HFS and 9039 patients who underwent HER). In the 
matched population, HFS patients showed an increased risk of in-hospital 
mortality (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.58-2.61) and 30-day hospital readmission (OR 1.97; 
95% CI 1.85-2.09). A sensitivity analysis performed on patients younger than 
65 years of age confirmed these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of Italian patients, hip fracture surgery was 
associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission 
when compared to elective hip replacement.

PURPOSE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a series (total of 3 injections) 
of intra-articular platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections in comparison to that 
of hyaluronic acid (HA) viscosupplementation for the treatment of symptomatic 
knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS: Outcome data regarding the use of PRP or HA injections for the 
treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis were determined from the 
highest-quality data (Level I) available in the literature until 2015. Health 
utility values were then derived from these high-quality data. Costs were 
determined by examining typical charges for patients undergoing a series of 
either PRP or HA injections for the treatment of this condition at a large 
private orthopaedic practice. These health utility values and costs were used to 
create an expected-value decision analysis model.
RESULTS: The results of the model revealed that the cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) of a series of PRP injections was $8,635.23/QALY and that of a 
series of HA injections was $5,331.75/QALY. A series of PRP injections was 
associated with a higher initial cost than a series of HA injections 
(difference, $1,433.67); however, PRP was also more effective (higher utility 
value) than HA by 0.11 QALYs (0.69 vs 0.58, P = .0062) at 1 year. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the use of PRP injections as opposed to 
HA was $12,628.15/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a series of either PRP ($8,635.23/QALY) or HA 
($5,331.75/QALY) injections for the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis 
would be considered cost-effective (cost per QALY < $50,000), PRP injections 
were not more cost-effective than HA injections. However, PRP was significantly 
more effective at 1 year, and being associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $12,628.15/QALY when compared with HA, a series of 
PRP injections should be considered a reasonable and acceptable alternative to 
HA injections for the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis of Level I studies.

Environmental pollution in the era of sustained economic development is an 
inevitable occurrence. However, the rising levels of pollutant emissions hamper 
air quality, hence, affecting health outcomes. Previous studies have assessed 
the case-by-case effect of ambient air pollution on mortality and morbidity, 
however, the impact on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and welfare cost 
have not been investigated entirely. Here, we conduct an empirical analysis of 
the 28-Year trend to analyze the nexus between ambient particulate matter and 
ozone, mortality, DALYs, and welfare cost across 195 countries and territories 
by employing novel dynamic panel estimation methods. We find that none of the 
195 countries and territories studied between 1990 and 2017 meet WHO guideline 
for air quality, thus, mitigating ambient air pollution is at risk. However, 
Spain with an annual average of PM2.5 not exceeding 15.12 μg/m3 is closer to WHO 
guideline of 10 μg/m3/annum. Among the countries (China, the US, Russia, India, 
Germany and Japan) with the highest welfare cost of premature death associated 
with the exposure to outdoor PM2.5 and ozone, China is the most vulnerable to 
economic burden - spending US$1.58 trillion (constant 2010) in 2017. This study 
demonstrates that ambient air pollution has a significant impact on economic 
development (welfare cost) and health outcomes (mortality, premature deaths, and 
DALYs).

The pandemic of acute respiratory illness caused by the novel betacoronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2, officially designated COVID-19, has attained the proportions of a 
global health crisis. Though all nations of the world have been affected by this 
disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, 
severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social 
and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but 
these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting 
that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to 
intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior 
intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may 
moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This 
hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of 
SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the 
variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical 
distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic 
infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological 
testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international 
health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by 
which this hypothesis may be tested. If the proposal put forth in this paper can 
be confirmed either wholly or in part, it would have significant implications in 
terms of strategies aimed at minimizing the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical 
setting.

Fruits are sources of bioactive compounds that are responsible for several 
biological activities. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the chemical 
composition of the pulp of the Brazilian Savanna fruit Dipteryx alata; evaluate 
its toxic effects, influence on the life expectancy of the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans, and its antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo; and 
describe the mechanisms involved. The chemical compounds identified include 
phenols, terpenes, fatty acid derivatives, vitamins, and a carboxylic acid. The 
in vitro antioxidant activity was demonstrated by radical scavenging methods. In 
vivo, the D. alata fruit pulp was not toxic and promoted resistance to oxidative 
stress in nematodes exposed to a chemical oxidizing agent. Furthermore, it 
promoted an increased life expectancy in wild-type nematodes and increased the 
expression of superoxide dismutase and the nuclear translocation of DAF-16. 
These results suggest that the beneficial effects identified are related to 
these two genes, which are involved in the regulation of metabolic activities, 
the control of oxidative stress, and the lifespan of C. elegans. These 
beneficial effects, which may be related to its chemical constituents, 
demonstrate its potential use as a functional and/or nutraceutical food.
