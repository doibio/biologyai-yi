Aims: Non-adherence is associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients 
with asthma. While cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is increasingly used to 
inform value assessment of the interventions, most do not take into account 
adherence in the analyses. This study aims to: (1) Understand the extent of 
studies considering adherence as part of the economic analyses, and (2) 
summarize the methods of incorporating adherence in the economic models. 
Materials and methods: A literature search was performed from the inception to 
February 2018 using four databases: PubMed, EMBASE, NHS EED, and the Tufts CEA 
registry. Decision model-based CEA of asthma were identified. Outcomes of 
interest were the number of studies incorporating adherence in the economic 
models, and the incorporating methods. All data were extracted using a 
standardized data collection form. Results: From 1,587 articles, 23 studies were 
decision model-based CEA of asthma, of which four CEA (17.4%) incorporated 
adherence in the analyses. Only the method of incorporating adherence by 
adjusting treatment effectiveness according to adherence levels was demonstrated 
in this review. Two approaches were used to derive the associations between 
adherence and effectiveness. The first approach was to apply a mathematical 
formula, developed by an expert panel, and the second was to extrapolate the 
associations from previous published studies. The adherence-adjusted 
effectiveness was then incorporated in the economic models. Conclusions: A very 
low number of CEA of asthma incorporated adherence in the analyses. All the CEA 
adjusted treatment effectiveness according to adherence levels, applied to the 
economic models.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-utility of two trabecular micro-bypass stents 
(TBS) implantation vs standard of care (SOC) in patients with mild-to-moderate 
open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in the Canadian healthcare setting.
METHODS: The deterioration in visual field (VF) defect over a 15-year time 
horizon was tracked using a Markov model with Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson stages of 
glaucoma (mild, moderate, advanced, severe/blind) and death as health states. 
Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials were conducted to estimate the 
pooled reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and medication use due to TBS and 
SOC. The rate of decline in VF loss was adjusted by the extent of IOP reduction 
to estimate transition probabilities. Healthcare resource utilization, unit 
costs (2017 CAD), and progression-related utility scores were obtained by 
literature review, and medication costs with wastage were obtained from IMS 
Brogan PharmaStat. The impact of parameter and methodological uncertainty on 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was examined using probabilistic 
and 1-way sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed an additional reduction of 1.13 
medications/patient and an additional decrease in IOP of -1.10 mmHg at 36 months 
favoring TBS. TBS strongly dominated medication alone, due to higher improvement 
in quality-of-life (0.068 QALYs), fewer blind eyes (-0.0031), and a decrease in 
total healthcare costs of C$2,908.3 per patient over the time horizon (C$9,394.1 
TBS vs C$12,302.4 medication alone). Sensitivity analyses showed that results 
were robust to the uncertainties in model inputs and assumptions. 
Time-to-dominance was 44 months (3.7 years).
CONCLUSIONS: The TBS procedure was cost-effective over SOC in a 15-year time 
horizon, with quality-of-life gains.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dapagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor available 
in China, where the disease burden of diabetes and its complications is very 
heavy. Because a new diabetes treatment strategy for diabetes should consider 
its cost-effectiveness, compared with an existing treatment, this study aimed to 
examine the cost-effectiveness between dapagliflozin and metformin treatment in 
China.
METHODS: The Cardiff Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to estimate cost 
effectiveness and macro- and micro-vascular outcomes of dapagliflozin vs 
metformin. The CDM effectiveness inputs were derived from indirect comparative 
efficacy data from meta-analysis of 71 studies comparing monotherapy and add-on 
therapy of dapagliflozin vs metformin: dapagliflozin or metformin monotherapy, 
add-on therapy with other oral hypoglycemic agents, and add-on therapy with 
insulin. Direct medication costs and medical costs on treating diabetes were 
calculated based on published and local sources. A discount rate of 3% was 
applied to both costs and health effects. Univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess uncertainties.
RESULTS: The total healthcare costs accumulated over the lifetime on 
dapagliflozin treatment arm was 8,626 Chinese yuan higher than the metformin 
treatment arm for an individual patient, and the quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained with dapagliflozin treatment was 0.8 more than metformin 
treatment. Therefore, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 10,729 yuan 
per QALY gained for dapagliflozin treatment arm vs metformin treatment arm. The 
cost-effectiveness results were robust to various sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin treatment was more cost-effective compared with 
metformin treatment for Chinese type 2 diabetes patients. However, the findings 
of favorable cost-effectiveness results for dapagliflozin are largely driven by 
the effects of favorable weight profile on clinical, utility, and costs in the 
Cardiff model.

In this report, we present a method for the construction of a soluble lead flow 
battery (SLFB) with an extended cycle life. By supplying an adequate amount of 
sodium acetate (NaOAc) to the electrolyte, a cycle life extension of over 50% is 
demonstrated for SLFBs via long-term galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments. 
A higher quality of the PbO2 electrodeposit at the positive electrode is 
quantitatively validated for NaOAc-added electrolyte by throwing index (TI) 
measurements. Images acquired by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also exhibit 
more integrated PbO2 surface morphology when the SLFB is operated with the 
NaOAc-added electrolyte. This work indicates that electrolyte modification can 
be a plausible route to economically enable SLFBs for large-scale energy 
storage.

This study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution and redistribution of 
lumbar erector spinae (ES) activity during a lumbar extension endurance task in 
pain-free participants and how this is modified in people with low back pain 
(LBP). High density surface electromyography (HDEMG) was recorded using 13 × 5 
electrode grids placed over the lumbar ES in 13 LBP and 13 control participants 
while completing an Ito test to task failure. The root mean square of the HDEMG 
signals was computed, a topographical map of the EMG amplitude generated and the 
centre of the activity (centroid) determined throughout the task. The centroid 
of the EMG amplitude map was systematically more cranial (F = 6.09, P = 0.022) 
for the LBP participants compared with the control subjects. Regression analysis 
showed that the extent of redistribution of ES activity was associated with 
longer endurance. These results show that LBP participants utilised a different 
motor strategy to perform the endurance task, characterised by greater 
activation of more cranial regions of the ES and less redistribution of ES 
activity throughout the task. This study provides new insight into the 
functional activation of the lumbar ES and how it is modified when people have 
pain.

phosphate binders, sevelamer and Lanthanum, in end-stage renal disease patients 
with hyperphosphatemia.

Nicosia, Nicosia , Cyprus.

INTRODUCTION: End-stage renal disease is associated with significant comorbidity 
and mortality. Among its implications, hyperphosphatemia constitutes a 
consistent and independent risk factor. The use of benchmark treatment, low-cost 
calcium-based binders declined due to a potential calcification effect on 
coronary arteries.
AREAS COVERED: Given the increasing prevalence of end-stage renal disease and 
the high cost of hyperphosphatemia's new primary modality, the non-calcium based 
phosphate binders, we set-off to systematically assess the economic evaluations 
of non-calcium containing phosphate binders, sevelamer and lanthanum. The study 
was performed based on a systematic review of the economic evaluations of 
sevelamer and lanthanum. The cost-effectiveness profile of the two 
non-calcium-containing Phosphate Binders compared to calcium-based phosphate 
binders depends on several factors such as future dialysis costs, utility 
values, age, survival, and phosphorus levels.
EXPERT OPINION: The comparison between the two agents is rather inconclusive; 
nevertheless, current review suggests that non-calcium-based phosphate binders 
may yield a positive cost-effectiveness ratio in patients with inadequate 
phosphorus management and patient with longer life-expectancy. It is crucial 
that the literature is endowed with more data, specifically on survival, future 
dialysis costs, and calcification.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases. 
Mobile health interventions such as smartphone apps can potentially provide a 
convenient low-cost addition to other obesity reduction strategies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the impacts on quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained and health system costs over the remainder of the life 
span of the New Zealand population (N=4.4 million) for a smartphone app 
promotion intervention in 1 calendar year (2011) using currently available apps 
for weight loss.
METHODS: The intervention was a national mass media promotion of selected 
smartphone apps for weight loss compared with no dedicated promotion. A 
multistate life table model including 14 body mass index-related diseases was 
used to estimate QALYs gained and health systems costs. A lifetime horizon, 3% 
discount rate, and health system perspective were used. The proportion of the 
target population receiving the intervention (1.36%) was calculated using the 
best evidence for the proportion who have access to smartphones, are likely to 
see the mass media campaign promoting the app, are likely to download a weight 
loss app, and are likely to continue using this app.
RESULTS: In the base-case model, the smartphone app promotion intervention 
generated 29 QALYs (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 14-52) and cost the health 
system US $1.6 million (95% UI: 1.1-2.0 million) with the standard download 
rate. Under plausible assumptions, QALYs increased to 59 (95% UI: 27-107) and 
costs decreased to US $1.2 million (95% UI: 0.5-1.8) when standard download 
rates were doubled. Costs per QALY gained were US $53,600 for the standard 
download rate and US $20,100 when download rates were doubled. On the basis of a 
threshold of US $30,000 per QALY, this intervention was cost-effective for Māori 
when the standard download rates were increased by 50% and also for the total 
population when download rates were doubled.
CONCLUSIONS: In this modeling study, the mass media promotion of a smartphone 
app for weight loss produced relatively small health gains on a population level 
and was of borderline cost-effectiveness for the total population. Nevertheless, 
the scope for this type of intervention may expand with increasing smartphone 
use, more easy-to-use and effective apps becoming available, and with 
recommendations to use such apps being integrated into dietary counseling by 
health workers.

ß-thalassemia is caused by ß-globin gene mutations resulting in reduced (β+) or 
absent (β0) hemoglobin production. Patient life expectancy has recently 
increased, but the need for chronic transfusions in transfusion-dependent 
thalassemia (TDT) and iron chelation impairs quality of life1. Allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation represents the curative treatment, 
with thalassemia-free survival exceeding 80%. However, it is available to a 
minority of patients and is associated with morbidity, rejection and 
graft-versus-host disease2. Gene therapy with autologous HSCs modified to 
express ß-globin represents a potential therapeutic option. We treated three 
adults and six children with ß0 or severe ß+ mutations in a phase 1/2 trial ( 
NCT02453477 ) with an intrabone administration of HSCs transduced with the 
lentiviral vector GLOBE. Rapid hematopoietic recovery with polyclonal 
multilineage engraftment of vector-marked cells was achieved, with a median of 
37.5% (range 12.6-76.4%) in hematopoietic progenitors and a vector copy number 
per cell (VCN) of 0.58 (range 0.10-1.97) in erythroid precursors at 1 year, in 
absence of clonal dominance. Transfusion requirement was reduced in the adults. 
Three out of four evaluable pediatric participants discontinued transfusions 
after gene therapy and were transfusion independent at the last follow-up. 
Younger age and persistence of higher VCN in the repopulating hematopoietic 
cells are associated with better outcome.

Proteome represents the set of proteins being produced by an organism at a given 
time. Comparative proteomic profiling of a healthy and diseased state is likely 
to reflect the dynamics of a disease process. Proteomic techniques are widely 
used to discover novel biomarkers and decipher mechanisms of HIV-1 pathogenesis. 
Proteomics is thus emerging as an indispensable tool of monitoring a disease 
process and intense interactions between HIV-1 and host. Nef is known to 
regulate various functions in the host to establish the state of infection. This 
review gives an overview of all proteomic studies done on HIV infection and HIV 
associated disorders including recent developments in Nef-host proteomic 
profiling. Here, we propose an emphasis on Nef based proteomic studies. We also 
discuss the future prospects and the technical and biological challenges 
involved in proteomic studies. Future studies with Nef related proteomic 
investigation are likely to identify more targets for diagnosis and therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To review systematically the published literature regarding the 
impact of treatment for OSA on monetized health economic outcomes.
METHODS: Customized structured searches were performed in PubMed, Embase 
(Embase.com), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley) 
databases. Reference lists of eligible studies were also analyzed. Titles and 
abstracts were examined, and articles were identified for full-text review. 
Studies that met inclusion criteria were evaluated in detail, and study 
characteristics were extracted using a standardized template. Quantitative 
characteristics of the studies were summarized, and a qualitative synthesis was 
performed.
RESULTS: Literature searches identified 2,017 nonredundant abstracts, and 196 
full-text articles were selected for review. Seventeen studies met inclusion 
criteria and were included in the final synthesis. Seven studies included formal 
cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses. Ten studies employed cohort 
designs, and four studies employed randomized controlled trial or 
quasi-experimental designs. Positive airway pressure was the most common 
treatment modality, but oral appliances and surgical approaches were also 
included. The most common health economic outcomes were health-care use (HCU) 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Follow-ups ranged from 6 weeks to 5 
years. Overall, 15 of 18 comparisons found that treatment of OSA resulted in a 
positive economic impact. Treatment adherence and OSA severity were positively 
associated with cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Although study methodologies varied widely, evidence consistently 
suggested that treatment of OSA was associated with favorable economic outcomes, 
including QALYs, within accepted ranges of cost-effectiveness, reduced HCU, and 
reduced monetized costs.

Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are 
growing problems, as average life expectancy is increasing globally. Drug 
discovery for neurological disease remains a major challenge. Poor understanding 
of disease pathophysiology and incomplete representation of human disease in 
animal models hinder therapeutic drug development. Recent advances with induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have enabled modeling of human diseases with 
patient-derived neural cells. Utilizing iPSC-derived neurons advances compound 
screening and evaluation of drug efficacy. These cells have the genetic 
backgrounds of patients that more precisely model disease-specific 
pathophysiology and phenotypes. Neural cells derived from iPSCs can be produced 
in a large quantity. Therefore, application of iPSC-derived human neurons is a

Arsenic is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring metalloid that poses a significant 
risk for human cancer and non-cancer diseases. It is now evident that arsenic 
contamination in food, especially rice and grains, presents a significant 
exposure to hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. However, the disease 
risk from chronic exposure to the low amounts of arsenic found in food remains 
to be established. Thus, this research estimates the global burdens of disease 
expressed as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for lung, skin and bladder 
cancers, as well as coronary heart disease (CHD) attributable to inorganic 
arsenic in food. To determine foodborne inorganic arsenic exposures worldwide, 
we used the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of food consumption in 17 
country clusters, in conjunction with the reported measurements of total and 
inorganic arsenic in different foods. We estimated cancer potency factors for 
arsenic related bladder and lung cancers, and from US Environmental Protection 
Agency risk estimates for skin cancer to calculate the cancer incidence in males 
and females within each of the WHO member states. Summary relative risk 
estimates and population attributable fractions were developed to estimate the 
YLD, YLL, and DALYs for arsenic-induced CHD. The findings indicate that, 
globally, each year the combined DALYs for all cancers attributable to inorganic 
arsenic in food are approximately 1.4 million with variation in global 
distribution based on population and food consumption patterns. The global 
burden of CHD attributable to foodborne inorganic arsenic also varied with WHO 
region and may contribute as much as 49 million DALYs. However, in contrast to 
cancer burden, there is a threshold effect for arsenic-associated CHD with no 
increased risk of heart disease at the expected lower bound of arsenic 
consumption in food. These estimates indicate that foodborne arsenic exposure 
causes a significant yet avoidable global burden of human disease.

INTRODUCTION: Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (f-ILD) comprises a group of 
diseases with lung scarring and reduced life expectancy. The short time from 
diagnosis to death affects the patients' bereaved spouses, who risk developing 
prolonged grief. In Denmark palliative care is most often offered to cancer 
patients.
AIM: We aimed to investigate the experience of spouses of f-ILD patients during 
the final stages of illness and up to the first year after the patient's death 
to investigate if palliative care could ease the transition and prevent PGD.
METHODS: Our study had a qualitative design triangulating in-depth interviews, 
field notes, participant diaries and the prolonged grief questionnaire PG-13. We 
included 20 spouses and applied thematic analysis. Initial coding was performed 
deductively according to the chronological stages of before, during and after 
the death of the patient. We subsequently coded inductively within the stages.
RESULTS: During the final days the spouses experienced emotional ambivalence 
shifting between hope, acceptance and despair. Factors affecting the spouses 
during the final hours were the timing, location, and process of death. After 
the patient's death the spouses experienced feelings of grief and optimism as 
they moved toward a new life on their own.
CONCLUSIONS: Some of the factors affecting the spouses and potentially causing 
prolonged grief might be alleviated by offering palliative/supportive care and 
advance care planning to f-ILD patients and their family.

BACKGROUND: The completeness of REarranged during Transfection (RET) testing in 
patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) was recently reported as 60%. 
However, the completeness on a population level is unknown. Similarly, it is 
unknown if the first Danish guidelines from 2002, recommending RET testing in 
all MTC patients, improved completeness in Denmark. We conducted a nationwide 
retrospective cohort study aiming to evaluate the completeness of RET testing in 
the Danish MTC cohort. Additionally, we aimed to assess the completeness before 
and after publication of the first Danish guidelines and characterize MTC 
patients who had not been tested.
METHODS: The study included 200 patients identified from the nationwide Danish 
MTC cohort 1997-2013. To identify RET tested MTC patients before December 31, 
2014, the MTC cohort was cross-checked with the nationwide Danish RET cohort 
1994-2014. To characterize MTC patients who had not been RET tested, we reviewed 
their medical records and compared them with MTC patients who had been tested.
RESULTS: Completeness of RET testing in the overall MTC cohort was 87% (95% CI: 
0.81-0.91; 173/200). In the adjusted MTC cohort, after excluding patients 
diagnosed with hereditary MTC by screening, completeness was 83% (95% CI: 
0.76-0.88; 131/158). Completeness was 88% (95% CI: 0.75-0.95; 42/48) and 81% 
(95% CI: 0.72-0.88) (89/110) before and after publication of the first Danish 
guidelines, respectively. Patients not RET tested had a higher median age at 
diagnosis compared to those RET tested. Median time to death was shorter in 
those not tested relative to those tested.
CONCLUSION: The completeness of RET testing in MTC patients in Denmark seems to 
be higher than reported in other cohorts. No improvement in completeness was 
detected after publication of the first Danish guidelines. In addition, data 
indicate that advanced age and low life expectancy at MTC diagnosis may serve as 
prognostic indicators to identify patients having a higher likelihood of missing 
the compulsory RET test.

PURPOSE: To compare oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes of patients 
with radiation-recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) after external beam radiation 
therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy (BT) treated with salvage high-intensity focused 
ultrasound (S-HIFU) or salvage radical prostatectomy (S-RP).
METHODS: This retrospective study compared 52 patients with radiation-recurrent 
PCa after EBRT or BT treated with S-HIFU (n = 27) or S-RP (n = 25) between 1998 
and 2016. We estimated overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), 
and metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 5 years. Incontinence after local salvage 
therapy (LST) was scored according to the number of pads used per day. 
Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.
RESULTS: Both groups were similar for pre-LST tumor features, however, no S-HIFU 
patients received BT and S-RP patients were younger and healthier. Median 
follow-up was 45 months for S-HIFU and 43 months for S-RP. No significant 
differences were found in estimated 5-year OS (80.9% vs. 61.9%, p = 0.24), 
5-year CSS (84.0% vs. 74.0%, p = 0.36), and 5-year MFS (60.3% vs. 55.2%, 
p = 0.55) for S-HIFU vs. S-RP, respectively. We observed a significant 
difference in pad-dependent status at 12 months (22.2% vs. 56.0%, p = 0.01) and 
in the number of Clavien ≥ III complications [9 (7/27 patients) vs. 16 (12/25 
patients), p = 0.027] in favor of S-HIFU vs. S-RP, respectively.
CONCLUSION: S-HIFU and S-RP could both be considered valuable LST options for 
patients with radiation-recurrent nonmetastatic PCa with sufficient life 
expectancy. S-RP is associated with more pad-dependent patients at 12 months.

BACKGROUND: Inhaled mannitol (Bronchitol®) is licensed in Australia as a safe 
and efficacious addition to best supportive care in patients with cystic 
fibrosis.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
inhaled mannitol (in addition to best supportive care) in the Australian setting 
from the perspective of a government-funded national healthcare system.
METHODS: A probabilistic patient-level simulation Markov model estimated 
life-time costs and outcomes of mannitol when added to best supportive care, 
compared with best supportive care alone in patients aged 6 years and older. We 
estimated treatment-related inputs (initial change in percentage of predicted 
forced expiratory volume, relative reduction in severe pulmonary exacerbations, 
and treatment discontinuations) from two phase III trials. Longer term natural 
history rates of predicted forced expiratory volume decline over time and severe 
pulmonary exacerbation rates for best supportive care were taken from Australian 
CF registries. The utility value for the cystic fibrosis health state was as 
measured in the trials using the Health Utility Index, whereas the impact of 
pulmonary exacerbations and lung transplantation on utility was ascertained from 
the published literature. The underlying cost of managing cystic fibrosis, and 
the cost associated with pulmonary exacerbations and transplantations was taken 
from published Australian sources.
RESULTS: The addition of inhaled mannitol to best supportive care resulted in a 
discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year of AU$39,165. The result was 
robust with 77% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis samples below a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$45,000/quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSION: Benchmarked against an implicit Australian willingness-to-pay 
threshold for life-threatening diseases, our model suggests inhaled mannitol 
provides a cost-effective addition to best supportive care in patients with 
cystic fibrosis, irrespective of concomitant dornase alfa use.

OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors 
associated with the surgical treatment of epiploic foramen entrapment (EFE).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study at a single referral hospital.
ANIMALS: Horses (n = 142) undergoing surgery (n = 145) for EFE.
METHODS: Preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data of surgeries on 
horses that underwent exploratory laparotomy for EFE were obtained. The 
postoperative outcome was assessed by follow-up telephone calls with the 
owners/caregivers. Factors associated with postoperative reflux (POR), 
relaparotomy, hospital discharge, colic after hospital discharge, and survival 
after discharge were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 145 surgeries were performed on 142 horses (recurrence rate, 
3%). Warmblood horses represented 85% of the horses that underwent surgery. 
Windsucking/crib-biting was confirmed in 60% of these surgery cases. 
Left-to-right entrapment was diagnosed in all horses. Ileal involvement was 
recorded in 74% of the cases. Uncontrollable intraoperative hemorrhage was 
encountered in 6% of the surgeries. One hundred seven (74%) horses recovered 
from surgery, and 65% of those survived to discharge. The rate of survival to 
discharge of all surgeries was 48%. The median survival of the cases that were 
discharged exceeded 3193 days. Horses requiring intestinal resection were 
predisposed to POR, and those undergoing jejunoileostomy were more prone to POR 
than those undergoing jejunojejunostomy. Horses with POR were less likely to be 
discharged than those without POR, and those that underwent resection had 
shorter life expectancy after hospital discharge than those that did not undergo 
resection.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of EFE was associated with high morbidity and 
mortality, with recurrence in at least 3% of surviving horses.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Owners of horses with EFE should be informed of the 
guarded prognosis associated with current surgical treatment.

Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective strategy for rapid gene 
function analysis. It is well established that the NAC transcription factor and 
salicylic acid (SA) signal pathway play essential roles in response to biotic 
stresses. However, simultaneous silencing of two target genes using VIGS in 
plants has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this report, we performed VIGS to 
silence simultaneously the SA-binding protein 2 (NbSABP2) and NbNAC1 in 
Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of 
simultaneous silencing of two genes. We first cloned the full-length NbNAC1 
gene, and the characterization of NbNAC1 was also analysed. Overlap extension 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the combination of NbSABP2 
and NbNAC1 was successfully amplified. Bacteria liquid PCR confirmed that the 
combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully inserted into the tobacco 
rattle virus vector. The results showed that the leaves from the NbSABP2 and 
NbNAC1 gene-silenced plants collapsed slightly, with browning at the base of 
petiole or veina. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression 
of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 were significantly reduced in 12 days post silenced plants 
after tobacco rattle virus infiltration compared with the control plants. 
Overall, our results suggest that VIGS can be used to silence simultaneously two 
target genes.

Objective: To analyze the burden of disease (BOD) on diabetes attributable to 
high BMI in China from 1990 to 2016. Methods: Data based on population of the 
2016 Global Burden of Disease Study for China were used to analyze the 
attributable fractions (PAF) of BOD for diabetes attributable to high BMI. 
Measurements for attributable BOD of diabetes included disability adjusted life 
years (DALY), years of lost life (YLL), years living with disability (YLD), 
death number and mortality rate. The average world population from 2010 to 2035 
was used as a reference. Results: In 2016, death number of diabetes attributable 
to high BMI was 40 310, which was significantly higher than that in 1990 (15 
008). Age-standardized death rate of diabetes attributable to high BMI increased 
from 2.01/100 000 in 1990 to 2.60/100 000 in 2016, which showed a more 
significant increasing trend in both males and people aged 15-49 years. DALYs of 
diabetes attributable to high BMI increased from 1.09 million person years to 
3.30 million person years. YLL and YLD also showed increasing trends. The 
highest increasing rate of YLD was in people aged 15-49 years. High BMI was 
responsible for 26.01% of the diabetes deaths in 2016 in China, an increase of 
39.39% compared with that in 1990 (18.66%). Most provinces in China experienced 
a sharp increase of DALY of diabetes attributable to high BMI from 1990 to 2016. 
Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Macao SAR, Sichuan and Qinghai had the most 
significant increase tendency in terms of DALY rate during this period. 
Conclusions: There was a rapid increase of the deaths and mortality rate of 
diabetes attributable to high BMI, causing a heavy disease burden, in China from 
1990 to 2016. The BOD varied in both different age and gender groups. More 
attention should be paid to males and people aged 15-49 years in the prevention 
and control programs of diabetes.

Publisher: 目的： 分析1990－2016年中国高BMI导致的糖尿病疾病负担。 方法： 
应用2016年全球疾病负担研究结果，分析1990－2016年中国各省份与高BMI具有病因学联系糖尿病的死亡资料以及疾病负担[包括伤残损失寿命年（YLD）、过早死亡损失寿命年(YLL)、伤残调整寿命年(DALY)]，以2010－2035年世界平均人口结构为标准，对死亡率进行标化，比较1990和2016年中国高BMI导致糖尿病死亡的变化情况。 
结果： 2016年归因于高BMI的糖尿病死亡数为40 310例，较1990年的15 
008例有大幅攀升。归因于高BMI的糖尿病标化死亡率从1990年的2.01/10万增至2016年的2.60/10万。高BMI导致的男性糖尿病患者标化死亡率的增长高于女性，15~49岁组糖尿病患者归因于高BMI的标化死亡率增幅最大。同期高BMI导致的糖尿病DALY从108.91万人年增长至330.02万人年，YLL和YLD也呈现增长趋势。15~49岁人群高BMI导致的糖尿病YLD的增长速度最快。2016年高BMI导致糖尿病死亡数占糖尿病总死亡数的26.01%，较1990年的18.66%增长了39.39%。与1990年相比，2016年中国几乎所有省份高BMI造成的糖尿病DALY均呈大幅增长，内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、浙江省、澳门地区、四川省和青海省DALY率的增长最为明显。 
结论： 
20余年间中国高BMI导致的糖尿病死亡病例显著增加，高BMI造成的糖尿病死亡率增幅显著。不同省份高BMI导致的糖尿病疾病负担差异很大。不同年龄段、不同性别归因于高BMI的糖尿病疾病负担的变化情况不同。作为糖尿病防治相对空白的人群，男性和15~49岁糖尿病患者的健康需求应给予足够的重视和卫生资源分配的倾斜。.

Objective: To analyze the disease burden of animal injury in China between 1990 
and 2016. Methods: Data obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2016 were 
used to analyze the age and gender specific disease burden of animal injury in 
China, using the incidence and disability adjusted of life years (DALYs) rate. 
Relative and annual changes were evaluated. Results: In 2016, the 
age-standardized incidence and DALYs rate of animal injury in China showed as 
245.05 per 100 000 people and 12.73 per 100 000. The age-standardized incidence 
of non-venomous animal injury was significantly higher than that of venomous 
animal injury, but the differences in age-standardized incidence and DALYs rate 
between venomous animal injury and non-venomous animal injury were not 
significant. Between 1990 and 2016, there was a significantly decreasing trend 
in the age-standardized incidence and DALYs rate of animal injury, and obvious 
decline could be seen in the incidence of non-venomous animal injury, compared 
with venomous animal injury. The incidence and DALYs rate of animal injury 
declined in both males and females and in different age groups. The obvious 
decline of incidence and DALYs rate could be found in children aged 5-14 years 
and aged <5 years. Conclusions: Between 1990 and 2016, there was a significant
