OBJECTIVES: Extending healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average 
number of years that a person can expect to live in "full health" by taking into 
account years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury, is a 
common topic worldwide. This study aims to clarify the relationships between the 
Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and life expectancy (LE) and HALE globally using 
publicly available international data.
SETTING: Analyses were conducted on 130 countries with populations of 1 million 
or more for which all data were available. Individual countries were scored from 
0 to 9 to indicate adherence to the Mediterranean diet according to the MDS 
scoring method. The supply of vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, 
fish, and olive oil per 1,000 kcal per country was calculated based on the Food 
and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database, with a score of 1 
for above the median and 0 for below. The same method was used to calculate 
scores of presumed detrimental components (meat and dairy), with consumption 
below the median given a value of 1, and consumption above the median given a 
value of 0. For ethanol, a score of 1 was given for 10g to 50 g of consumption. 
We investigated the cross-sectional associations between the MDS and LE and HALE 
at birth in 2009, and the longitudinal associations between the MDS in 2009 and 
LE and HALE between 2009 and 2019, controlling for covariates at baseline using 
linear mixed models.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, the MDS was significantly positively 
associated with LE (β=0.906 [95% confidence interval, 0.065-1.747], p=0.037) and 
HALE (β=0.875 [0.207-1.544], p=0.011) after controlling for all covariates. The 
longitudinal analysis also revealed significantly positive associations between 
the MDS and LE (0.621 [0.063-1.178], p=0.030) and HALE (0.694 [0.227-1.161], 
p=0.004) after controlling for all covariates.
CONCLUSION: The present study, based on an analysis using 10 years of 
international data, showed that countries with a higher MDS showed a positive 
association with HALE.

BACKGROUND: Population aging-the inevitable increase in the percentage of older 
adults-is occurring all around the world as the fertility rate declines and life 
expectancy rises. This study examined the relationship between socioeconomic 
status (SES), mental health, and the need for long-term services and support 
(LTSS) among Korean older adults. It also aimed to provide evidence-based 
information for South Korea's long-term support services and programs.
METHODS: This study used the data on older adults aged over 60 years from the 
2018 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA). Ultimately, 5,527 older adults 
were included in the database (42.6% men, 57.4% women). To clarify the 
association between SES, mental health, and the need for LTSS among older Korean 
men and women, chi-squared test, t-test, and structural equation modeling (SEM) 
were performed.
RESULTS: The SEM analysis showed that a significant, negative association was 
observed between SES and the need for LTSS among these older adults-the higher 
SES groups would generally have less need for LTSS. Mental health had a strong, 
negative impact on the need for LTSS-better mental health status of the older 
individuals would indicate a lower need for LTSS, and the effect was stronger 
among older men. Meanwhile, the positive relationship between SES and mental 
health was verified-the higher the SES of these older adults the better their 
mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender- and social class-sensitive impacts of mental health on the 
need for LTSS were observed in this study. These findings could provide an 
evidence-based reference for interventions targeting different genders and 
social classes in Korea's long-term care system, such as the enhancement of 
social welfare and mental health status of the older adults.

Objectives: Burden of Disease frameworks facilitate estimation of the health 
impact of diseases to be translated into a single measure, such as the 
Disability-Adjusted-Life-Year (DALY). Methods: DALYs were calculated as the sum 
of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) directly 
associated with COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) from 01 March 2020, to 
28 February 2021. Life expectancy is based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
Study life tables for 2019. Results: There were 220,273 confirmed cases with a 
total of 4,500 deaths as a direct result of COVID-19. DALYs were estimated to be 
51,622.8 (95% Uncertainty Intervals [UI] 50,721.7, 52,435.8). Overall, YLL 
contributed to 98.5% of the DALYs. Of total symptomatic cases, 6.5% required 
hospitalisation and of those hospitalised 10.8% required intensive care unit 
treatment. COVID-19 was likely to be the second highest cause of death over our 
study's duration. Conclusion: Estimating the burden of a disease at national 
level is useful for comparing its impact with other diseases in the population 
and across populations. This work sets out to standardise a COVID-19 BoD 
methodology framework for the RoI and comparable nations in the EU.

The prevalence of viral infections, cancer, and diabetes is increasing at an 
alarming rate around the world, and these diseases are now considered to be the 
most serious risks to human well-being in the modern period. There is a 
widespread practice in Asian countries of using papaya leaves (C. papaya L.) as 
herbal medicine, either alone or in combination with prescribed medications, to 
treat a variety of ailments. The importance of conducting the necessary 
descriptive studies in order to determine the safety of papaya leaf consumption 
is also emphasized in the context of their application in the healthcare sector. 
Electronic databases such as Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed were used to 
gather information on papaya leaves, their therapeutic potential, and clinical 
evidence-based studies. The literature was gathered from publications on papaya 
leaves, their therapeutic potential, and clinical evidence-based studies. The 
antidengue, anticancer, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory 
effects of papaya leaves discussed in this article are supported by evidence 
from preclinical, in vivo, in vitro, and clinical trial studies, as well as from 
other sources. Leaves have been investigated for their mechanism of action as 
well as their potential to be used in the development of novel herbal products 
for the health business. According to the reports gathered, only a small number 
of research demonstrated that leaf extract at high concentrations was hazardous 
to certain organs. The collective literature reviewed in this review provides 
insights into the use of papaya leaves as a cure for epidemic diseases, 
highlighting the phytochemical composition and pharmacological attributes of 
papaya leaves, as well as the results of various preclinical and clinical 
studies that have been conducted so far on the subject. The review clearly 
demonstrates the successful medical evidence for the use of papaya leaf extracts 
in the healthcare system as a supplemental herbal medication in a variety of 
clinical settings.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing life expectancy has led to a higher incidence of cancer 
in the elderly, thus making them vulnerable and worsening their health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) and their need for support.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the HRQoL and social support in 
elderly Greek lung and gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 104 elderly cancer 
patients, who were receiving chemotherapy in the outpatient department and 
inpatient ward of a General Hospital in Athens. The data were collected using 
purposive sampling between December 2019 and May 2020, and included demographic 
and clinical characteristics, the HRQoL questionnaire, Short Form 36 (SF36), and 
the Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ-2000).
RESULTS: The participants' median age was 72 years; the majority were male 
(62.5%) and had lung cancer (57.7%). The SF36 data revealed a relatively 
moderate (42.7-62.61) HRQoL in most subscales. The "Pain" subscale recorded the 
highest score (75.0), and the "social function" subscale the lowest (42.79). The 
PQR-2000 indicated a satisfactory level of social support (81.65), with values 
ranging between 48 and 105; married patients with higher education scored more 
highly (p < .05). Patients aged 65-75 years reported better HRQoL and greater 
social support than older patients. In addition, patients with their own family 
and a relatively high income reported better HRQoL and social support compared 
to single individuals, with low income, who were cared for by their children. 
Positive and statistically significant (p < .05) correlations were found between 
the SF36 subscales of role functioning/physical, vitality, general health, 
emotional well-being and the PRQ-2000.
CONCLUSION: The HRQoL and social support of elderly cancer patients positively 
affect the course of their health. Healthcare systems and social services should 
address the multiplying needs of these patients with targeted interventions to 
support their well-being.

Background: Early detection and precise prognostic evaluation of clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are crucial for patient life expectancy. Ion 
channel-related genes (ICRGs) are of great diagnostic and prognostic value as 
components that maintain the normal structure of the kidney. Therefore, we 
systematically explored the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value of 
ICRGs in ccRCC using the multi-database. Methods: RNA transcriptome profiles and 
clinical data of ccRCC patients were extracted and integrated from public 
databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas, ICGC, GEO, and E-MTAB databases. 
Ion channel-related genes were obtained from the literature collection. The 
diagnostic signature was performed using the LASSO and SVM-REF analyses. 
Meanwhile, the prognostic signature was conducted using the LASSO analyses. 
Molecular subtyping was performed using the ConsensusClusterPlus and the 
corresponding therapeutic targets were evaluated using the pRRophetic package. 
In addition, a prognostic nomogram was constructed based on the results of cox 
regression analyses. Results: We successfully constructed diagnostic signatures 
for five ICRGs and prognostic signatures for 10 ICRGs with AUC values greater 
than 0.7, showing good predictive performance. Based on the median risk score, 
we found that high-risk patients had a significantly worse prognosis. We also 
divided ccRCC patients into two clusters according to prognostic ICRGs, and 
there was a significant survival outcome between the two clusters and different 
sensitivity to diverse clinical therapeutic strategies. Meanwhile, we 
constructed a nomogram based on clinical molecules and signatures, and its 
predictive efficacy was better than the signature or the present 
tumor-node-metastasis staging system. Conclusion: In this study, we established 
useful signatures for early detection, prognosis evaluation, and individualized 
treatment for ccRCC. Moreover, KCNJ16 deserves to be explored comprehensively in 
the future.

In recent decades, life expectancy has been increasing significantly. In this 
scenario, health interventions are necessary to improve prognosis and quality of 
life of elderly with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease. 
However, the number of elderly patients included in clinical trials is low, thus 
current clinical practice guidelines do not include specific recommendations. 
This document aims to review prevention recommendations focused in patients ≥ 75 
years with high or very high cardiovascular risk, regarding objectives, medical 
treatment options and also including physical exercise and their inclusion in 
cardiac rehabilitation programs. Also, we will show why geriatric syndromes such 
as frailty, dependence, cognitive impairment, and nutritional status, as well as 
comorbidities, ought to be considered in this population regarding their 
important prognostic impact.

in 2020 in Sweden: four times more years of life lost per suicide than per 
COVID-19 death.

BACKGROUND: The burden of disease from the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is large; however, suicide affects the 
population year after year. From a public health perspective, it is important to 
not neglect contributors to the total burden of disease. The aim of this paper 
is to compare years of life lost (YLL) to suicide with those lost to coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: A nationwide cohort study in 2020, in Sweden. YLL was measured as the 
sex- and age-specific remaining life expectancy at the time of the person's 
death based on the death risks that pertained to the Swedish population in 2019. 
YLL to suicide was compared to YLL to COVID-19 and presented by sex and age 
groups. Suicide deaths in 2020 were estimated as the annual average of suicides 
in 2015-2019.
RESULTS: Annual average of suicide was 1,565, whereof 1,076 (68.8%) men and 489 
(31.2%) women. In 2020, 10,650 persons died of COVID-19, whereof 5,681 (53.3%) 
men and 4,969 (46.7%) women. Estimated total YLL to suicide and COVID-19 in 2020 
was 53,237 and 90,116, respectively. The COVID-19 YLL to suicide YLL ratio in 
2020 was 1.69 (90,116/53,237). Men accounted for 67.1% of suicide YLL and of 
56.4% of COVID-19 YLL. Those 44 years or younger accounted for 60.3% of suicide 
YLL and 3.9% of COVID-19 YLL. Those 75 years and older accounted for 2.9% of 
suicide YLL and 60.9% of COVID-19 YLL. On average, each suicide generates 34 YLL 
(53,237/1,565), and each COVID-19 death generates 8.5 YLL (90,116/10,650).
CONCLUSIONS: YLL to suicide affects Sweden year after year, foremost 
attributable to the younger age groups, whereas YLL to COVID-19 is foremost 
attributable to the elderly. On average, each suicide generates four times more 
YLL than a COVID-19 death. Enormous efforts and resources have been put on 
tackling the pandemic, and without these, the burden would probably have been 
much larger. However, from a public health perspective, it is important to not 
neglect other contributors to the total burden of disease where national efforts 
also may have an impact.

BACKGROUND: Although increasing evidence supports a vital role for assembly 
factor for spindle microtubules (ASPM) and trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) 
in the tumorigenesis of some cancers, no systematic pancancer analyses of ASPM 
and TROAP have been performed. Thus, we aimed to investigate the potential 
functions of ASPM and TROAP across 31 cancer types.
METHODS: Based on datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein 
Atlas (HPA), Gene-Cloud of Biotechnology Information (GCBI) and Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO), we employed an array of bioinformatics methods to explore the 
potential oncogenic roles of ASPM and TROAP.
RESULTS: ASPM and TROAP, which were highly expressed in most cancers and 
presented a strict positive correlation, led to a decreased life expectancy 
among cancer patients. ASPM and TROAP both regulated cell replication in the 
S&G2 phase of the cell cycle. Through a protein-protein interaction network 
(PPI) analysis of ASPM and TROAP, we found that cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) 
was regulated by TROAP and functioned upstream of ASPM. Thus, TROAP can regulate 
the role of ASPM in cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: The ASPM and TROAP have a significant positive correlation and 
similar expression profiles, and promote tumor malignancy and development in the 
S&G2 phase of the cell cycle. Since ASPM is one of the downstream targets of 
TROAP, TROAP and especially ASPM may be potential tumor makers and promising 
targets for therapeutic strategy.

There is growing concern over the rising share of the US economy devoted to 
health care spending. Fueled in part by demographic transitions, unchecked 
increases in entitlement spending will necessitate some combination of 
substantial tax increases, elimination of other public spending, or 
unsustainable public debt. This massive increase in health spending might be 
warranted if each dollar devoted to the health care sector yielded real health 
benefits, but this does not seem to be the case. Although we have seen 
remarkable gains in life expectancy and functioning over the past several 
decades, there is substantial variation in the health benefits associated with 
different types of spending. Some treatments, such as aspirin, beta blockers, 
and flu shots, produce a large health benefit per dollar spent. Other more 
expensive treatments, such as stents for cardiovascular disease, are high value 
for some patients but poor value for others. Finally, a large and expanding set 
of treatments, such as proton-beam therapy or robotic surgery, contributes to 
rapid increases in spending despite questionable health benefits. Moving 
resources toward more productive uses requires encouraging providers to deliver 
and patients to consume high-value care, a daunting task in the current 
political landscape. But widespread inefficiency also offers hope: Given the 
current distribution of resources in the US health care system, there is 
tremendous potential to improve the productivity of health care spending and the 
fiscal health of the United States.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and incurable neurodegenerative 
disorder of integrative areas of the brain, characterized by cognitive decline 
and disability resulting in negative impacts on the family of the patients and 
the health care services worldwide. AD involves oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation and accelerated apoptosis, accompanied by deposition of 
amyloid-β peptide plaques and tau protein-based neurofibrillary tangles in the 
central nervous system. Among the multiple factors that contribute to the onset 
and evolution of this disease, aging stands out. That is why the prevalence of 
this disease has increased due to the constant increase in life expectancy. In 
the hope of finding new, more effective methods to slow the progression of this 
disease, over the last two decades, researchers have promoted "omics"-based 
approaches that include the gut microbiota and their reciprocal interactions 
with different targets in the body. This scientific advance has also led to a 
better understanding of brain compartments and the mechanisms that affect the 
integrity of the blood-brain barrier. This review aims to discuss recent 
advances related to the gut-brain-microbiota axis in AD. Furthermore, 
considering that AD involves psychiatric symptoms, this review also focuses on 
the psychiatric factors that interact with this axis (an issue that has not yet 
been sufficiently addressed in the literature).

Design and control of intelligent bionic artificial hand based on image 
recognition.

Shi P, Fang K, Yu H.

BACKGROUND: At present, the popular control method for intelligent bionic 
prosthetic hands is EMG control. However, the control accuracy of this method is 
low. It is a trend to integrate computer vision into the prosthetic hand.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to design an intelligent prosthetic hand 
based on image recognition, improve the control accuracy and the quality of life 
of the disabled.
METHODS: Convolutional neural network is used to recognize the object to be 
grasped, and the recognition result is used as a trigger signal to control our 
intelligent prosthetic hand. We have designed a four-bar linkage mechanism and a 
side swing mechanism in the structure, which can not only achieve the flexion 
and extension of fingers but also realize the adduction and abduction of the 
four fingers and the lateral swing of the thumb.
RESULTS: Through the method of image recognition, the new intelligent bionic 
hand can achieve five kinds of Human action. Including grasp, side pinch, 
three-finger pinch, two-finger pinch, and pinch between fingers.
CONCLUSIONS: The experiment result proves that the precision of image 
recognition control is very excellent, the intelligent prosthetic hand can be 
completed the corresponding task.

Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, is the most prevalent disease in 
dairy cattle that has a potential impact on profitability and animal welfare. 
Specifically designed multi-omics studies can be used to prioritize candidate 
genes and identify biomarkers and the molecular mechanisms underlying mastitis 
in dairy cattle. Hence, the present study aimed to explore the genetic basis of 
bovine mastitis by integrating microarray and RNA-Seq data containing healthy 
and mastitic samples in comparative transcriptome analysis with the results of 
published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a literature mining 
approach. The integration of different information sources resulted in the 
identification of 33 common and relevant genes associated with bovine mastitis. 
Among these, seven genes-CXCR1, HCK, IL1RN, MMP9, S100A9, GRO1, and SOCS3-were 
identified as the hub genes (highly connected genes) for mastitis susceptibility 
and resistance, and were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
and gene regulatory network construction. Gene ontology annotation and 
enrichment analysis revealed 23, 7, and 4 GO terms related to mastitis in the 
biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories, 
respectively. Moreover, the main metabolic-signalling pathways responsible for 
the regulation of immune or inflammatory responses were significantly enriched 
in cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, the IL-17 signaling pathway, viral 
protein interaction with cytokines and cytokine receptors, and the chemokine 
signaling pathway. Consequently, the identification of these genes, pathways, 
and their respective functions could contribute to a better understanding of the 
genetics and mechanisms regulating mastitis and can be considered a starting 
point for future studies on bovine mastitis.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness, burden of disease and 
budget impact of inclisiran added to standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy in 
the real-world secondary cardiovascular prevention population in Switzerland.
METHODS: An open-cohort Markov model captured event risks by sex, age and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol based on epidemiological and real-world 
data. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with add-on inclisiran was 
based on trial results and translated to meta-analysis-based relative risks of 
cardiovascular events. Unit costs for 2018 were based on publicly available 
sources, adopting a Swiss healthcare system perspective. Price assumptions of 
Swiss francs (CHF) 500 and CHF 3,000 per dose of inclisiran were evaluated, 
combined with uptake assumptions for burden of disease and budget impact. The 
assessment of cost-effectiveness used a discount rate of 3% per year. We 
performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and extensive 
scenario analyses.
RESULTS: Patients treated with inclisiran gained a 0.291 qualityadjusted 
life-year at an incremental cost per QALY gained of CHF 21,107/228,040 
(life-long time horizon, discount rate 3%) under the lower/higher price. 
Inclisiran prevented 1025 cardiovascular deaths, 3425 acute coronary syndrome 
episodes, and 1961 strokes in 48,823 patients ever treated during 10 years; the 
5-year budget impact was CHF 49.3/573.4 million under the lower/higher price. 
Estimates were sensitive to calibration targets and treatment eligibility; 
burden of disease/budget impact results also to uptake. Limitations included 
uncertainties about model assumptions and the size and characteristics of the 
population modelled.
CONCLUSIONS: Inclisiran may be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of CHF 
30,000 if priced at CHF 500; a threshold upwards of CHF 250,000 will be required 
if priced at CHF 3000. Inclisiran could enable important reductions in 
cardiovascular burden particularly under broader eligibility with a budget 
impact range from moderate to high depending on price.

The increase life expectancy led to an expected increase in skin cancer 
incidence in older patients. Their treatment can require a complex 
decision-making process. Limited data are available on characteristics, 
management and outcome of skin tumours in nonagenarian and centenarian patients. 
The aim of our study was to describe epidemiology, clinical-pathological 
features and treatment strategies of skin cancers in a cohort of patients aged 
≧95 years. A total of 116 patients ≧95 years of age presented for the evaluation 
of 225 skin lesions (mean of 1.94 lesions per patient). The mean age was 
97.4 years, 57.8% were women. Most patients had an ECOG score of 3 (49.3%) or 4 
(32%). Lesions were mainly located on the head and neck area (74.2%), upper 
(7.1%) and lower (6,2%) limbs. The majority of patients presented with 
non-melanoma skin cancers (183/225; 81.3%), 25/225 (11.1%) had actinic 
keratosis, 5 (2.2%) melanoma and 2 (0.9%) atypical fibroxanthoma. Forty-eight 
lesions (21.3%) were treated with surgery, 58 (25.8%) with radiotherapy. The 
management of 73 lesion (32.4%) was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumour 
board meeting. One patient died for the progression of a squamous cell 
carcinoma; 74 patients died for causes unrelated to skin tumours, 36 are still 
alive after a mean follow-up of 27.27 months. This cohort study confirms that 
age is not per se a contraindication for treatment of skin cancers in elderly 
patients. Our results support the importance of a patient-centred care approach 
that should take into consideration patient's preferences, comorbidities, 
compliance and possible adverse events.

Promotion de la santé en psychiatrie et santé mentale : l’exemple du syndrome 
métabolique et des pratiques infirmières.

[Article in French]

Sonethavy M, Morvillers JM.

Introduction : Life expectancy in psychiatric patients is reduced by 15 to 20 
years due to the presence of comorbidities and the lifestyle of these patients. 
Metabolic syndrome, also a side effect of antipsychotic drugs, is an aggravating 
factor of this phenomenon, which is why health promotion is essential. The 
objective of this study is to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices 
of psychiatric nurses with regard to metabolic syndrome, using N. Pender's 
health promotion model as a framework.Methodology : A multicenter descriptive 
study using a « knowledge, attitude, practice » survey was conducted in 16 
psychiatric departments in the Ile-de-France region. 70 nurses were interviewed 
via online questionnaires.Results : The results show partial knowledge. A gap 
exists between attitudes and nursing practices. The nurses' actions mainly 
involve counseling. The type of nursing knowledge is discussed, as well as the 
need for reflection on the nurse-patient relationship. Nursing interventions 
need to be further developed to better manage metabolic syndrome.Conclusion : 
Training is needed to carry out preventive measures and promote health more 
effectively.

OBJECTIVES: Whether decreased tongue strength is associated with poor clinical 
outcomes is unclear. This systematic review investigated the effect of decreased 
tongue strength on the clinical outcomes of adults requiring medical treatment.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Systematic reviews, randomized control trials, 
intervention studies, and longitudinal observational studies involving patients 
with decreased tongue strength requiring medical treatment were included.
METHODS: Articles published between January 2000 and June 2021 were retrieved 
from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ichushi-web (in Japanese), Web of Science, 
ClinicalTrials.gov, UMIN, the Cochrane Library, and Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment 
Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. The study protocol was pre-registered in XXX.
RESULTS: After screening 3040 articles and excluding duplicates, 74 articles 
were retrieved; after full-text evaluation of the 74 articles, seven articles 
(with 787 patients) were found to meet the inclusion criteria. The cut-off 
values for determining decreased tongue strength ranged from 13.8 to 21.6 kPa. 
Patients with decreased tongue strength had poorer recovery of their swallowing 
function, higher incidence of pneumonia, and poorer life expectancy than those 
with high tongue strength. However, tongue strength in older patients with 
decreased tongue strength increased when they performed physical exercise 
interventions and followed strict nutritional management plans.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased tongue strength was related to poor clinical outcomes in 
in- and outpatients. Oral frailty in older patients should be given increased 
attention in hospitals, and further research is needed to improve the clinical 
outcomes for older people with reduced tongue strength.
