OBJECT: Neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) represents a significant health 
problem with potentially devastating consequences. The most common form of NBPP 
involves the upper trunk roots. Currently, primary surgical repair is performed 
if clinical improvement is lacking. There has been increasing interest in 
"early" surgical repair of NBPPs, occurring within 3-6 months of life. However, 
early treatment recommendations ignore spontaneous recovery in cases of Erb's 
palsy. This study was undertaken to evaluate the optimal timing of surgical 
repair in this group with respect to quality of life.
METHODS: The authors formulated a decision analytical model to compare 4 
treatment strategies (no repair or repair at 3, 6, or 12 months of life) for 
infants with persistent NBPPs. The model derives data from a critical review of 
published studies and projects health-related quality of life and 
quality-adjusted life years over a lifetime.
RESULTS: When evaluating the quality of life of infants with NBPP, improved 
outcomes are seen with delayed surgical repair at 12 months, compared with no 
repair or repair at early and intermediate time points, at 3 and 6 months, 
respectively. ANOVA showed that the differences among the 4 groups are highly 
significant (F = 8369; p < 0.0001). Pairwise post hoc comparisons revealed that 
there are highly significant differences between each pair of strategies (p < 
0.0001). Meta-regression showed no evidence of improved outcomes with more 
recent treatment dates, compared with older ones, for either nonsurgical or for 
surgical treatment (p = 0.767 and p = 0.865, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: These data support a delayed approach of primary surgical 
reconstruction to optimize quality of life. Early surgery for NBPPs may be an 
overly aggressive strategy for infants who would otherwise demonstrate 
spontaneous recovery of function by 12 months. A randomized, controlled trial 
would be necessary to fully elucidate the natural history of NBPP and determine 
the optimal time point for surgical intervention.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation effects on spinal cord compression in 
Hurler.

Hurler syndrome type 1 (MPS-1) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder due 
to the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase which is necessary for the 
degradation of dermatan and heparan sulfate. It is characterized by deposit of 
glycosaminoglycans in tissues, progressive multisystem dysfunction, and early 
death. HSCT for children with MPS-I is effective, resulting in increased life 
expectancy and improvement of clinical parameters. The spinal MRI performed on a 
female 10 yr old undergoing HSCT at the age of 18 months and receiving ERT 
revealed a considerable decrease in soft tissue around the tip of odontoid 
causing a significant reduction in spinal cord compression. In light of this 
result, we suppose that combined ERT and HSCT are successful in Hurler I 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Many deaths from cancer are caused by metastatic burden. Prognosis 
and survival rates vary, but survival beyond 5 years of patients with untreated 
metastatic disease in the liver is rare. Treatment for liver metastases has 
largely been surgical resection, but this is feasible in only approximately 
20-30% of people. Non-surgical alternatives to treat some liver metastases can 
include various forms of ablative therapies and other targeted treatments.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 
different ablative and minimally invasive therapies for treating liver 
metastases.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane 
Library were searched from 1990 to September 2011. Experts were consulted and 
bibliographies checked.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of the literature were undertaken to appraise 
the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ablative therapies and 
minimally invasive therapies used for people with liver metastases. Studies were 
any prospective study with sample size greater than 100 participants. A 
probabilistic model was developed for the economic evaluation of the 
technologies where data permitted.
RESULTS: The evidence assessing the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of ablative and other minimally invasive therapies was 
limited. Nine studies of ablative therapies were included in the review; each 
had methodological shortcomings and few had a comparator group. One randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) of microwave ablation versus surgical resection was 
identified and showed no improvement in outcomes compared with resection. In two 
prospective case series studies that investigated the use of laser ablation, 
mean survival ranged from 41 to 58 months. One cohort study compared 
radiofrequency ablation with surgical resection and five case series studies 
also investigated the use of radiofrequency ablation. Across these studies the 
median survival ranged from 44 to 52 months. Seven studies of minimally invasive 
therapies were included in the review. Two RCTs compared chemoembolisation with 
chemotherapy only. Overall survival was not compared between groups and 
methodological shortcomings mean that conclusions are difficult to make. Two 
case series studies of laser ablation following chemoembolisation were also 
included; however, these provide little evidence of the use of these 
technologies in combination. Three RCTs of radioembolisation were included. 
Significant improvements in tumour response and time to disease progression were 
demonstrated; however, benefits in terms of survival were equivocal. An 
exploratory survival model was developed using data from the review of clinical 
effectiveness. The model includes separate analyses of microwave ablation 
compared with surgery and radiofrequency ablation compared with surgery and one 
of radioembolisation in conjunction with hepatic artery chemotherapy compared 
with hepatic artery chemotherapy alone. Microwave ablation was associated with 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £3664 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained, with microwave ablation being associated with reduced 
cost but also with poorer outcome than surgery. Radiofrequency ablation compared 
with surgical resection for solitary metastases < 3 cm was associated with an 
ICER of -£266,767 per QALY gained, indicating that radiofrequency ablation 
dominates surgical resection. Radiofrequency ablation compared with surgical 
resection for solitary metastases ≥ 3 cm resulted in poorer outcomes at lower 
costs and a resultant ICER of £2538 per QALY gained. Radioembolisation plus 
hepatic artery chemotherapy compared with hepatic artery chemotherapy was 
associated with an ICER of £37,303 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: There is currently limited high-quality research evidence upon 
which to base any firm decisions regarding ablative therapies for liver 
metastases. Further trials should compare ablative therapies with surgery, in 
particular. A RCT would provide the most appropriate design for undertaking any 
further evaluation and should include a full economic evaluation, but the group 
to be randomised needs careful selection.

The Mediterranean flour moth (Anagasta kuehniella) is a pest insect that attacks 
stored foods. The difficulty in controlling this kind of pest promotes the 
development of alternatives for pest control, among them the use of proteins 
with insecticide effect. In this work, we evaluated the role of a trypsin 
inhibitor purified from Entada acaciifolia seeds (EATI) on the A. kuehniella 
development. Different concentrations of inhibitor were added to a diet to 
determine its effects on insect performance. At 0.4%, the EATI decreases the 
larval weight and survival rates by 54.6% and 15%, respectively; in addition to 
the extension of the life cycle of insect. The biochemical analysis showed that 
the inhibitor is refractory to the digestion by midgut proteases, and led to a 
reduction of 32% in general proteolytic activity. A detailed analysis of the 
enzymatic activity revealed a decrease of 50% in trypsin activity as the 
chymotrypsin activity increased by 12%; possibly to compensate the commitment of 
the digestive process. The trypsins from the EATI-fed group stayed sensitive to 
the inhibition by EATI, and based on kinetic assays no new trypsin enzymes were 
produced as adaptation attempt. The insecticides effects observed for the EATI 
against this pest encourage a more in depth study of its possible long-term use 
as a biotechnological tool.

Two recent studies identify how sex-specific pheromonal factors in flies and 
worms alter lifespan through metabolic pathways that are shared with mammals. 
Sex differences in human lifespans imply nonautonomous effects modulated by 
sex-specific gene-environment interactions that could still include pheromonal 
mechanisms.

Tobacco dependence is the most common substance use disorder in adults with 
mental illness. The prevalence rates for tobacco dependence are two to four 
times higher in these patients than in the general population. Smoking has a 
strong, negative influence on the life expectancy and quality of life of mental 
health patients, and remains the leading preventable cause of death in this 
group. Despite these statistics, in some countries smokers with mental illness 
are disadvantaged in receiving intervention and support for their tobacco 
dependence, which is often overlooked or even tolerated. This statement from the 
European Psychiatric Association (EPA) systematically reviews the current 
evidence on tobacco dependence and withdrawal in patients with mental illness 
and their treatment. It provides seven recommendations for the core components 
of diagnostics and treatment in this patient group. These recommendations 
concern: (1) the recording process, (2) the timing of the intervention, (3) 
counselling specificities, (4) proposed treatments, (5) frequency of contact 
after stopping, (6) follow-up visits and (7) relapse prevention. They aim to 
help clinicians improve the care, health and well-being of patients suffering 
from mental illness.

OBJECTIVES: The epidemiology and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) 
has changed significantly, with lower prevalence, increased longevity of 
patients, increased use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and improved 
outcome. The clinical and health economic effectiveness of one-time screening of 
65-year-old men was assessed within this context.
METHODS: One-time ultrasound screening of 65-year-old men (invited) versus no 
screening (control) was analysed in a Markov model. Data on the natural course 
of AAA (risk of repair and rupture) was based on randomised controlled trials. 
Screening detected AAA prevalence (1.7%), surgical management (50% EVAR), repair 
outcome, costs, and long-term survival were based on contemporary 
population-based data. Incremental cost-efficiency ratios (ICER), absolute and 
relative risk reduction for death from AAA (ARR, RRR), numbers needed to screen 
(NNS), and life-years gained were calculated. Annual discounting was 3.5%.
RESULTS: In base case at 13-years follow-up the ICER was €14,706 per incremental 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); ARR was 15.1 per 10,000 invited, NNS was 530, 
and QALYs gained were 56.5 per 10,000 invited. RRR was 42% (from 0.36% in 
control to 0.21% in invited). In a lifetime analysis the ICER of screening 
decreased to €7,570/QALY. The parameters with highest impact on the 
cost-efficiency of screening in the sensitivity analysis were the prevalence of 
AAA (threshold value <0.5%) and degree of incidental detection in the control 
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: In the face of recent changes in the management and epidemiology of 
AAA, screening men for AAA remains cost-effective and delivers significant 
clinical impact.

INTRODUCTION: New multidetector row computed tomography (CT) has made the 
imaging of younger children more feasible and extending CT indications to a wide 
range of pediatric respiratory diseases in the last few years. However, CT is a 
source of radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the main 
indications and the contribution of chest CT in pediatric pulmonology as well as 
induced radiation.
METHODS: This was an observational, prospective study. Children whose chest CTs 
were analyzed during multidisciplinary meetings (radiologist, pulmonary 
pediatrician) were included from November 2009 to April 2010. We collected 
demographic data, CT results, contribution of CT to diagnosis and management, 
and radiation doses (dose-length product [DLP] and effective dose). Radiation 
doses were compared according to the CT scans (Lille University Hospital with 
128-slice dual-source CT or Lille University Hospital single-source 64-slice CT, 
or CT performed outside the university hospital).
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients were included. The mean age was 6.4 
years old. The main indications were analysis of bronchial disease (44%), 
infectious disease (16%), interstitial disease (14%), or a malformation (9%). 
The aim of CT was diagnosis (61%) or follow-up of previous lung diseases (39%). 
Diagnosis chest-CT directly contributed to diagnosis in 48% of cases and to 
treatment in 24%. Follow-up CT contributed to diagnosis in 38% and treatment in 
19% of cases. DLP and effective doses were significantly lower for CT performed 
in the university hospital, especially with the 128-slice CT compared to the 
others (P<0.001). The effective doses were: 128-slice CT, 0.61 mSv ± 0.32; 
64-slice CT, 1.24 mSv ± 0.97; outside university hospital, 2.56 mSv ± 1.98.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the role played by chest CT in children, which 
contributes to diagnosis and management of lung diseases. The main concern of CT 
application, especially in children, is the radiation burden. Children are more 
susceptible to the effects of radiation than adults and have a longer life 
expectancy to develop complications. Both radiologists and pediatricians should 
be aware of a potential risk and have to conjugate their efforts in reducing 
this risk. The wide range of radiation doses in this study for the same CT 
procedures underlines the extensive efforts still needed to limit radiation 
exposure in children.

The TOR kinase pathway is central in modulating aging in a variety of animal 
models. The target of rapamycin (TOR) integrates a complex network of signals 
from growth conditions, nutrient availability, energy status, and physiological 
stresses and matches an organism's growth rate to the resource environment. 
Important remaining problems are the identification of the pathways that 
interact with TOR and their characterization as additive or synergistic. One of 
the most versatile stress sensors in metazoans is the Jun-N-terminal kinase 
(JNK) signaling pathway. JNK is an evolutionarily conserved stress-activated 
protein kinase that is induced by a range of stressors, including UV 
irradiation, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, heat, and bacterial antigens. 
JNK is thought to interact with the TOR pathway, but its effects on TOR are 
poorly understood. We used the rotifer Brachionus manjavacas as a model animal 
to probe the regulation of TOR and JNK pathways and explore their interaction. 
The effect of various chemical inhibitors was examined in life table and 
stressor challenge experiments. A survey of 12 inhibitors revealed two, 
rapamycin and JNK inhibitor, that significantly extended lifespan of B. 
manjavacas. At 1 μM concentration, exposure to rapamycin or JNK inhibitor 
extended mean rotifer lifespan by 35% and maximum lifespan by 37%. Exposure to 
both rapamycin and JNK inhibitor simultaneously extended mean rotifer lifespan 
by 65% more than either alone. Exposure to a combination of rapamycin and JNK 
inhibitors conveyed greater protection to starvation, UV and osmotic stress than 
either inhibitor alone. RNAi knockdown of TOR and JNK gene expression was 
investigated for its ability to extend rotifer lifespan. RNAi knockdown of the 
TOR gene resulted in 29% extension of the mean lifespan compared to control and 
knockdown of the JNK gene resulted in 51% mean lifespan extension. In addition 
to the lifespan, we quantified mitochondria activity using the fluorescent 
marker MitoTracker and lysosome activity using LysoTracker. Treatment of 
rotifers with JNK inhibitor enhanced mitochondria activity nearly 3-fold, 
whereas rapamycin treatment had no significant effect. Treatment of rotifers 
with rapamycin or JNK inhibitor reduced lysosome activity in 1, 3 and 8 day old 
animals, but treatment with both inhibitors did not produce any additive effect. 
We conclude that inhibition of TOR and JNK pathways significantly extends the 
lifespan of B. manjavacas. These pathways interact so that inhibition of both 
simultaneously acts additively to extend rotifer lifespan more than the 
inhibition of either alone.

It is important to consider the value for money offered by existing elderly 
influenza vaccination programs, particularly as doubts persist about the 
magnitude of the effectiveness of such programs. An informative approach to 
explore the value of vaccination is to consider what vaccine efficacy would be 
required for a program to be considered cost-effective. To estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of the current elderly (65+ years) influenza vaccination 
program in Australia, we modelled how the hypothetical removal of vaccination 
would increase current disease burden estimates depending on alternative vaccine 
efficacy assumptions. The base-case results of the analysis found that the 
existing elderly vaccination program is likely to be cost-effective (under 
A$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained) if the vaccine efficacy is above 
∼30%. This study offers reassurance that the influenza vaccination of elderly 
Australians is likely to offer value for money.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a supported employment (SE) 
intervention that had been previously found effective in veterans with spinal 
cord injuries (SCIs).
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis, using cost and quality-of-life data 
gathered in a trial of SE for veterans with SCI.
SETTING: SCI centers in the Veterans Health Administration.
PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=157) who completed a study of SE in 6 SCI centers. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention of SE (n=81) or treatment as 
usual (n=76).
INTERVENTION: A vocational rehabilitation program of SE for veterans with SCI.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and quality-adjusted life years, which were 
estimated from the Veterans Rand 36-Item Health Survey, extrapolated to Veterans

RESULTS: Average cost for the SE intervention was $1821. In 1 year of follow-up, 
estimated total costs, including health care utilization and travel expenses, 
and average quality-adjusted life years were not significantly different between 
groups, suggesting the Spinal Cord Injury Vocational Integration Program 
intervention was not cost-effective compared with usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: An intensive program of SE for veterans with SCI, which is more 
effective in achieving competitive employment, is not cost-effective after 1 
year of follow-up. Longer follow-up and a larger study sample will be necessary 
to determine whether SE yields benefits and is cost-effective in the long run 
for a population with SCI.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate costs and outcomes of 
subsequent trials of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) compared with 
elective repeat cesarean deliveries (ERCD).
STUDY DESIGN: To compare TOLAC and ERCD, maternal and neonatal decision analytic 
models were built for each hypothetic subsequent delivery. We assumed that only 
women without previa would undergo TOLAC for their second delivery, that women 
with successful TOLAC would desire future TOLAC, and that women who chose ERCD 
would undergo subsequent ERCD. Main outcome measures were maternal and neonatal 
mortality and morbidity rates, direct costs, and quality-adjusted life years. 
Values were derived from the literature. One-way and Monte-Carlo sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: TOLAC was less costly and more effective for most models. A progression 
of decreasing incremental cost and increasing incremental effectiveness of TOLAC 
was found for maternal outcomes with increasing numbers of subsequent 
deliveries. This progression was also displayed among neonatal outcomes and was 
most prominent when neonatal and maternal outcomes were combined, with an 
incremental cost and effectiveness of -$4700.00 and .073, respectively, for the 
sixth delivery. Net-benefit analysis showed an increase in the benefit of TOLAC 
with successive deliveries for all outcomes. The maternal model of the second 
delivery was sensitive to cost of delivery and emergent cesarean delivery. 
Successive maternal models became more robust, with the models of the 
third-sixth deliveries sensitive only to cost of delivery. Neonatal models were 
not sensitive to any variables.
CONCLUSION: Although nearly equally effective relative to ERCD for the second 
delivery, TOLAC becomes less costly and more effective with subsequent 
deliveries.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the target populations and drug efficacy, 
toxicity, cost, and initiation age thresholds under which a pharmacologic 
regimen for knee osteoarthritis (OA) prevention could be cost-effective.
DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated 
state-transition simulation model of knee OA, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of using disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) as prophylaxis for the disease. We 
assessed four cohorts at varying risk for developing OA: (1) no risk factors, 
(2) obese, (3) history of knee injury, and (4) high-risk (obese with history of 
knee injury). The base case DMOAD was initiated at age 50 with 40% efficacy in 
the first year, 5% failure per subsequent year, 0.22% major toxicity, and annual 
cost of $1,000. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Key parameters were 
varied in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For the high-risk cohort, base case prophylaxis increased 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.04 and lifetime costs by $4,600, and 
produced an ICER of $118,000 per QALY gained. ICERs >$150,000/QALY were observed 
when comparing the base case DMOAD to the standard of care in the knee injury 
only cohort; for the obese only and no risk factors cohorts, the base case DMOAD 
was less cost-effective than the standard of care. Regimens priced at $3,000 per 
year and higher demonstrated ICERs above cost-effectiveness thresholds 
consistent with current US standards.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of DMOADs for OA prevention for persons at 
high risk for incident OA may be comparable to other accepted preventive 
therapies.

    Epidemiology. 2014 Mar;25(2):191-3.

BACKGROUND: Social differences in mortality have increased in high-income 
countries, but the causes of these changes remain unclear. We quantify the 
contribution of alcohol and smoking to trends in income differences in life 
expectancy from 1988 through 2007 in Finland.
METHODS: An 11% sample from the population registration data of Finns 25 years 
and older was linked with an 80% oversample of death records. 
Alcohol-attributable mortality was based on underlying and contributory causes 
of death on individual death certificates and smoking-attributable mortality on 
an indirect method that used lung cancer mortality as an indicator for the 
impact of smoking on mortality.
RESULTS: Alcohol- and smoking-attributable deaths reduced life expectancy by 
about 4.5 years among men. Alcohol-attributable mortality increased and 
smoking-attributable mortality decreased over the period 1988-2007, leaving the 
joint contribution stable. Among women, the contribution of these risk factors 
to life expectancy over the same period increased from 0.7 to 1.2 years. In 
2003-2007, life expectancy differentials between the lowest and highest income 
quintile were 11.4 years (men) and 6.3 years (women). In the absence of alcohol 
and smoking, these differences would have been 60% less for men and 36% less for 
women. Life expectancy differentials increased rapidly over the study period; 
without alcohol and smoking, the increase would have been 69% less among men and 
85% less among women.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and smoking have a major influence on income differences in 
mortality and, with the exception of smoking among men, their contribution is 
increasing. Without alcohol and smoking, there would have been little change in 
life expectancy differentials.

Cellular regulation of extension and retraction of pseudopod-like blebs produced 
by nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF).

Recently we described a new phenomenon of anodotropic pseudopod-like blebbing in 
U937 cells exposed to nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF). In Ca(2+)-free 
buffer such exposure initiates formation of pseudopod-like blebs (PLBs), 
protrusive cylindrical cell extensions that are distinct from apoptotic and 
necrotic blebs. PLBs nucleate predominantly on anode-facing cell pole and extend 
toward anode during nsPEF exposure. Bleb extension depends on actin 
polymerization and availability of actin monomers. Inhibition of intracellular 
Ca(2+), cell contractility, and RhoA produced no effect on PLB initiation. 
Meanwhile, inhibition of WASP by wiskostatin causes dose-dependent suppression 
of PLB growth. Soon after the end of nsPEF exposure PLBs lose directionality of 
growth and then retract. Microtubule toxins nocodazole and paclitaxel did not 
show immediate effect on PLBs; however, nocodazole increased mobility of 
intracellular components during PLB extension and retraction. Retraction of PLBs 
is produced by myosin activation and the corresponding increase in PLB cortex 
contractility. Inhibition of myosin by blebbistatin reduces retraction while 
inhibition of RhoA-ROCK pathway by Y-27632 completely prevents retraction. 
Contraction of PLBs can produce cell translocation resembling active cell 
movement. Overall, the formation, properties, and life cycle of PLBs share 
common features with protrusions associated with ameboid cell migration. PLB 
life cycle may be controlled through activation of WASP by its upstream 
effectors such as Cdc42 and PIP2, and main ROCK activator-RhoA. Parallels 
between pseudopod-like blebbing and motility blebbing may provide new insights 
into their underlying mechanisms.

Sciences, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, asma3494@hotmail.com.

The government of Maldives considers that the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable level of health is a basic right of every citizen. Thus it lays 
emphasis on the accessibility and affordability of health care services. In 
order to achieve these objectives, it is very important to expand curative 
services as well as preventive services in the country. The major hurdles faced 
by the country are result of the inherent structural problem faced by the county 
which leads to sever diseconomies of scale in the provision of healthcare 
services. Community and individual involvement and self-reliance are very 
important to achieve Health for All by the Year 200 AD. Community participation 
is one of the domains of community capacity building in a small island country. 
It is one of the mechanisms to empower people to take part in community 
development. In this paper, the nature, the dimensions of community 
participation, and its role and scope in implementation of different components 
of primary health care have been described. The health services in public and 
curative care have been briefed. Some of the achievements in health sector have 
also been briefly presented.

Preoperative findings, pathological stage PSA recurrence in men with prostate 
cancer incidentally detected at radical cystectomy: our experience in 242 cases.

PURPOSE: Preoperative findings, pathological stage PSA recurrence in patients 
with prostate cancer incidentally detected (iPCa) at radical cystectomy (RCP) 
were prospectively evaluated.
METHODS: From July 2000 to July 2013, 242 men 71 years old (median) underwent 
RCP; preoperatively, all patients underwent digital rectal examination (DRE), 
total and free/total PSA. The bladder was totally examined; moreover, the 
prostate gland was step-sectioned at 4-mm intervals. The incidence of iPCa that 
fulfilled criteria for clinically significant iPCa was recorded: tumor volume 
≥0.5 mL, Gleason grade ≥4, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, 
lymph node metastasis or positive surgical margins. In the presence of iPCa, the 
patients underwent PSA evaluation during the follow-up and recurrence was 
defined as two subsequent rises >0.2 ng/mL.
RESULTS: Among the 50 (20.6%) out of 242 patients submitted to RCP, an iPCa was 
found and 18 (36%) of them met criteria for insignificant iPCa; moreover, 30% of 
the patients had apex involvement. Median total PSA and PSA F/T values were not 
significantly different in the presence versus the absence of iPCa (2.6 vs 2.7 
ng/mL and 26 vs 27%; p > 0.05) and between significant versus insignificant iPCa 
(p > 0.05). None of the patients during the follow-up (median 58 months; range 
6-102 months) had PSA recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: PSA and PSA F/T values are provided for poor accuracy in 
distinguishing preoperatively significant from insignificant iPCa; however, the 
life expectancy of the patients is dramatically influenced by bladder cancer pTN 
(in our series, none developed PSA failure). In younger men in whom a 
prostate-sparing cystectomy could be proposed, an accurate preoperative 
evaluation should be mandatory to rule out significant iPCa at the risk of apex 
involvement (in our series equal to 30% of the cases).

BACKGROUND: Syphilis in pregnancy imposes a significant global health and 
economic burden. More than half of cases result in serious adverse events, 
including infant mortality and infection. The annual global burden from 
mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis is estimated at 3.6 million 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and $309 million in medical costs. 
Syphilis screening and treatment is simple, effective, and affordable, yet, 
worldwide, most pregnant women do not receive these services. We assessed 
cost-effectiveness of scaling-up syphilis screening and treatment in existing 
antenatal care (ANC) programs in various programmatic, epidemiologic, and 
economic contexts.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We modeled the cost, health impact, and cost-effectiveness 
of expanded syphilis screening and treatment in ANC, compared to current 
services, for 1,000,000 pregnancies per year over four years. We defined eight 
generic country scenarios by systematically varying three factors: current 
maternal syphilis testing and treatment coverage, syphilis prevalence in 
pregnant women, and the cost of healthcare. We calculated program and net costs, 
DALYs averted, and net costs per DALY averted over four years in each scenario. 
Program costs are estimated at $4,142,287 - $8,235,796 per million pregnant 
women (2010 USD). Net costs, adjusted for averted medical care and current 
services, range from net savings of $12,261,250 to net costs of $1,736,807. The 
program averts an estimated 5,754 - 93,484 DALYs, yielding net savings in four 
scenarios, and a cost per DALY averted of $24 - $111 in the four scenarios with 
net costs. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating MTCT of syphilis through expanded screening and 
treatment in ANC is likely to be highly cost-effective by WHO-defined thresholds 
in a wide range of settings. Countries with high prevalence, low current service 
coverage, and high healthcare cost would benefit most. Future analyses can be 
tailored to countries using local epidemiologic and programmatic data.

Post-mating, sexual interactions of opposite sexes differ considerably in 
different organisms. Post-mating interactions such as re-mating behavior and 
male harassment can affect the fitness of both sexes. Echinothrips americanus is 
a new insect pest in Mainland China, and little is known about its post-mating 
interactions. In this study, we observed re-mating frequency and male harassment 
frequency and their effects on fitness parameters and offspring sex ratios of E. 
americanus females. Furthermore, we tested the impact of mating and post-mating 
interactions on fitness parameters of males. Our results revealed that the 
re-mating frequency in female adults was extremely low during a 30-day period. 
However, post-mating interactions between females and males, consisting mainly 
of male harassment and female resistance, did occur and significantly reduced 
female longevity and fecundity. Interestingly, increased access to males did not 
affect the ratio of female offspring. For males, mating dramatically reduced 
their longevity. However, post-mating interactions with females had no effects 
on the longevity of mated males. These results enrich our basic knowledge about 
female and male mating and post-mating behaviors in this species and provide 
important information about factors that may influence population regulation of 
this important pest species.

Modern cardiac rhythm management systems have become increasingly complex. The 
decision on which specific system to implant in a given patient often rests with 
the implanting physician. We conducted a multiple-choice survey to assess the 
opinions and preferences of cardiologists and electrophysiologists who implant 
and follow cardiac rhythm management systems. Reliability and battery longevity 
were viewed as the most important characteristics in device selection. Patient 
characteristics which most affected device choice were pacing indication and 
life expectancy. Remote technology was used in 47% of pacemaker patients, 64% of
