ventricular LS strain as well as effective diastolic period slightly decreased, 
whereas atrial strain and inter-chamber relationships remained unchanged after 
running a 246-km-ultra-marathon race. These changes may be attributed to 
concomitant pre- and afterload alterations following UEE.

INTRODUCTION: Quantifying the years of life gained associated with 
light-intensity physical activity may be important for risk communication in 
public health. Because no studies have examined the role of light-intensity 
physical activity in life expectancy, this study aims to quantify the years of 
life gained from light-intensity physical activity in a population-based U.S.
METHODS: This study used data from 6,636 participants in the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2006). Analyses were conducted in 2020. 
Light-intensity physical activity was categorized into low, medium, and high on 
the basis of tertiles, and survival models were applied to estimate the years of 
life gained from each light-intensity physical activity group. Analyses were 
repeated in participants with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity above or 
below the median.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 11 years and at 55,520 person-years, 994 
deaths were recorded. At age 20 years, participants with low, medium, and high 
light-intensity physical activity had a predicted life expectancy of 53.92 (95% 
CI=46.66, 61.18), 58.16 (95% CI=52.10, 65.22), and 58.44 (95% CI=51.29, 65.60) 
years, suggesting significant years of life gained from medium and high levels 
of light-intensity physical activity of 2.89 (95% CI=0.90, 4.12) and 3.07 (95% 
CI=0.84, 5.30) years. The corresponding years of life gained at age 45 years and 
65 years were 2.51 (95% CI=0.40, 5.47) and 1.52 (95% CI=0.54, 2.50) years for 
the medium light-intensity physical activity group and 2.66 (95% CI=0.80, 4.52) 
and 1.62 (95% CI=0.49, 52.75) years for the high light-intensity physical 
activity group. This association was significant in participants with 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity below the median but not for those with 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity above the median.
CONCLUSIONS: Light-intensity physical activity may extend life expectancy. Given 
the low prevalence of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in populations, 
physical activity promotion efforts may capitalize on emerging evidence on 
light-intensity physical activity, particularly among the most inactive groups.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the trajectories of work ability over 
16 years preceding the individual pensionable age and to examine the association 
with retirement timing.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 2612 public sector employees from the 
Finnish Retirement and Aging study and the Finnish Public Sector study. 
Participants were grouped into 'no-extension' (retired at the individual 
pensionable date or worked no longer than 6 months after that date) and 
'extension' (worked more than 6 months after individual pensionable age). 
Trajectories of self-reported work ability score (0-10) in maximum of eight 
measurement points over 16 years preceding retirement were examined using the 
group-based latent trajectory analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to 
analyse the association between trajectory groups and extended employment.
RESULTS: Four stable ('Stable excellent', 7%; 'Stable high', 62%; 'Stable 
medium', 24%; 'Low', 4%) and one decreasing ('Declining', 3%) work ability 
trajectories were identified. After taking into account gender, age, 
occupational status, marital status and self-rated health, 'Stable excellent' 
trajectory was associated with a higher likelihood of extended employment 
compared with the 'Low' (risk ratio (RR) 2.38, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.68) and to the 
'Declining' (RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.32 to 6.01) trajectories. There was no difference 
in retirement timing between 'Declining', 'Low' and 'Stable medium' 
trajectories.
CONCLUSION: Work ability remained relatively stable among majority of the 
participants over 16 years of follow-up. Stable excellent work ability from 
mid-life to late career was associated with higher likelihood of extending 
employment beyond individual pensionable age than those with low or declining 
work ability.

Populations in the high-income countries of Western Europe are aging due to 
increased life expectancy. As the prevalence of diabetes and obesity has 
increased, so has the burden of kidney failure. To determine the global capacity 
for kidney replacement therapy and conservative kidney management, the 
International Society of Nephrology conducted multinational, cross-sectional 
surveys and published the findings in the International Society of Nephrology 
Global Kidney Health Atlas. In the second iteration of the International Society 
of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas, we aimed to describe the availability, 
accessibility, quality, and affordability of kidney failure care in Western 
Europe. Among the 29 countries in Western Europe, 21 (72.4%) responded, 
representing 99% of the region's population. The burden of kidney failure 
prevalence varied widely, ranging from 760 per million population (pmp) in 
Iceland to 1612 pmp in Portugal. Coverage of kidney replacement therapy from 
public funding was nearly universal, with the exceptions of Germany and 
Liechtenstein where part of the costs was covered by mandatory insurance. 
Fourteen (67%) of 21 countries charged no fees at the point of care delivery, 
but in 5 countries (24%), patients do pay some out-of-pocket costs. Long-term 
dialysis services (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were available in 
all countries in the region, and kidney transplantation services were available 
in 19 (90%) countries. The incidence of kidney transplantation varied widely 
between countries from 12 pmp in Luxembourg to 70.45 pmp in Spain. Conservative 
kidney care was available in 18 (90%) of 21 countries. The median number of 
nephrologists was 22.9 pmp (range: 9.47-55.75 pmp). These data highlight the 
uniform capacity of Western Europe to provide kidney failure care, but also the 
scope for improvement in disease prevention and management, as exemplified by 
the variability in disease burden and transplantation rates.

OBJECTIVES: This study was to clarify changes in physical function and quality 
of life (QOL) for postoperative, and to examine the influence of the amount of 
physical activity on these variables.
METHODS: This study included 29 patients who underwent gastrointestinal cancer 
surgery. The QOL measurement was used to the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for preoperative and 2nd 
and 4th postoperative weeks. Physical function measured knee extension strength, 
4 m walk time, 5 times sit-to-stand test, and 6-minute walk for preoperative and 
1st and 2nd postoperative weeks. The amount of physical activity score was based 
on METs-hours, which is estimated from cumulative physical activity. As basic 
characteristics were investigated cancer stage, comorbidities and complications, 
and operative. Statistical analysis was repeated measures analysis of variance 
was performed to observe postoperative changes in physical function and QOL. 
Furthermore, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to the parameters of 
physical function and QOL affected by the physical activity score were 
investigated.
RESULTS: Physical function decreased postoperatively and generally improved 2nd 
postoperative week. Though scores on the QOL functional scales improved, some 
items did not improve sufficiently. Multiple regression analysis showed that 
physical activity score had an effect on constipation and emotion functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in symptom scales is not sufficient in a short period 
of time, and they need to be followed up by increasing the amount of physical 
activity and promoting instantaneous exercise.

We recently encountered concern about the safety of bariatric surgery for a 
patient with cystinuria. Bariatric surgery procedures include those that cause 
malabsorption, like the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, and restrictive 
operations, such as the sleeve gastrectomy. These procedures produce beneficial 
effects on health and life expectancy, though whether kidney stones are 
prevented, as well as promoted, is not established. Although the importance of 
body weight to metabolic stone activity in patients with cystinuria is not 
established, the patient's physicians were concerned about whether any bariatric 
surgery procedure would affect her ability to drink sufficient quantities of 
water in order to reduce stone activity. Here we report the experience of a 
genetically defined patient with cystinuria who underwent a gastric sleeve 
procedure. In the months after the procedure, she lost 45 kg, though with time 
she regained 23 kg of that loss. She was able to maintain a urine volume of 
4.0 L per day and has had no stone recurrence.

This study steps through four key principles, four open problems and future 
perspectives of Chinese materia medica(CMM) ecological agriculture by presenting 
the historical development, existing theories and practice outcomes. Then, it 
focuses on refining the main principles of CMM ecological agriculture:(1)the 
principles of ecological niche associated with yield and comprehensive 
income;(2)principles of biological diversity associated with the integrated 
control of diseases, pests and weeds;(3)principles of adversity effects 
associated with the quality improvement of CMM;(4)principles of structural 
stability associated with the sustainable development of CMM ecological 
agriculture. On this basis, four burning issues of CMM ecological agriculture 
were obtained,(1)ecological planting mode and supporting technologies need to be 
perfect;(2)multi-integrated industrial coupling remains to strengthen;(3) 
quality assurance system of CMM ecological agriculture and high-quality and 
favorable price model remains to be formed;(4)awareness of the demonstration and 
extension of CMM ecological agriculture needs to be desired. Finally, 
suggestions for the sustainable development of CMM ecological agriculture are 
put forward:(1)strengthen the national planning and layout, develop CMM 
ecological agriculture accor-ding to local conditions;(2)pay equal attention to 
inheritance and innovation, and strengthen the theory and practical technology 
research of CMM ecological agriculture;(3)strengthen industrial coupling and 
realize the transformation of CMM ecological agriculture from a production-based 
to a multi-in-one compound model;(4)intensify standards and brands, building a 
quality assurance system for CMM ecological products;(5) publicize the 
demonstration and popularization of CMM ecological agriculture. In summary, the 
development of CMM ecological agriculture possessed a firmer theory and practice 
foundation, although there is still much room for improvement. A better field of 
Chinese medicine agricultural development with immense economic and social 
benefits will not a question of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot; by 
accurately grasp the way forward.

Late diagnosis of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia: long-term consequences 
during adulthood.

SUMMARY: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive 
disorders related to enzyme deficiencies in the adrenal steroidogenesis pathway 
leading to impaired corticosteroid biosynthesis. Depending on the extension of 
enzyme defect, there may be variable severities of CAH - classic and 
non-classic. We report the case of a 37-year-old male patient with a previously 
unknown diagnosis of classic CAH referred to Endocrinology evaluation due to 
class III obesity and insulin resistance. A high diagnostic suspicion was raised 
at the first Endocrinology consultation after careful past medical history 
analysis especially related to the presence of bilateral adrenal myelolipomas 
and primary infertility. A genetic test confirmed the presence of a variant of 
the CYP21A2 in homozygous with an enzymatic activity of 0-1%, corresponding to a 
classic and severe CAH form. Our case represents an unusually late definitive 
diagnose of classic CAH since the definition was established only during 
adulthood in the fourth decade of life. The missing diagnosis of classic 21 
hydroxylase deficiency during infancy led to important morbidity, with a high 
impact on patients' quality of life.
LEARNING POINTS: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of 
autosomal recessive enzyme disorders responsible for an impaired cortical 
adrenal hormonal synthesis. CAH may be divided into two major forms: classic and 
non-classic CAH. If untreated, CAH may be fatal or may be responsible for 
important multi-organ long-term consequences that can be undervalued during 
adulthood. Adrenal myelolipomas are associated with chronic exposure to high 
ACTH levels and continuous androgen hyperstimulation typically found in 
undertreated CAH patients. Testicular adrenal rest tumours (TART) and primary 
infertility can be the first manifestation of the disease during adulthood.

IMPORTANCE: Adults with dementia may experience poorer quality of chronic 
disease management because of the difficulty in reporting symptoms and engaging 
in shared decision-making associated with cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the quality of chronic disease management received by 
adults with and without dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this cross-sectional study, nationally 
representative data from noninstitutionalized patients 65 years or older were 
obtained from the 2002-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The control group 
comprised adults of similarly limited life expectancy without dementia comprised 
. Data analysis was performed in June 2020.
EXPOSURES: Dementia diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality of chronic disease management based on 14 
individual quality indicators. The association between dementia status and the 
quality of chronic disease management (3 composite categories: preventive care, 
diabetes care, and medication treatment) was examined using multivariable linear 
regression models. Survey weights, sampling strata, and primary sampling unit 
variables were used to produce national estimates adjusted for nonresponse.
RESULTS: This study included 2506 adults (mean [SD] age, 81.4 [4.7] years; 1259 
[49.3%] female; 1243 [50.7%] male), of whom 1335 (53.3%) had a diagnosis of 
dementia and 1171 (46.7%) did not have a diagnosis of dementia. After adjusting 
for potential confounders, adults with dementia received lower-quality 
preventive care compared with adults of similar life expectancy without dementia 
(adjusted absolute difference [aAD], -6.1 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, -9.7 
to -2.5 pp; P = .001). We found no evidence that the quality of care differed in 
diabetes care (aAD, 1.7 pp; 95% CI, -4.5 to 7.9 pp; P = .59) and medication 
treatment (aAD, 1.0 pp; 95% CI, -5.0 to 7.0 pp; P = .75).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the quality of chronic 
disease management for adults with dementia was not substantially different from 
that for those without dementia despite potential barriers. Future studies are 
warranted to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of these 
findings for preventive care.

Multivalent Albumin-Neonatal Fc Receptor Interactions Mediate a Prominent 
Extension of the Serum Half-Life of a Therapeutic Protein.

Technology (GIST), Gwangju 61005, Republic of Korea.

Human serum albumin (HSA) has been used to extend the serum half-life of 
therapeutic proteins owing to its exceptionally long serum half-life via the 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling mechanism. In most cases, only 
one HSA molecule was conjugated to a therapeutic protein, leading to a limited 
extension of the serum half-life. In this study, we hypothesized that 
conjugation of multiple HSA molecules to a therapeutic protein significantly 
further extends the serum half-life via multivalent HSA-FcRn interactions. We 
chose urate oxidase (Uox), a tetrameric therapeutic protein used for the 
treatment of gout, as a model. In previous studies, only one HSA molecule was 
site-specifically conjugated to one Uox because of poor conjugation yield of the 
relatively slow bio-orthogonal chemistry, strain-promoted azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition (SPAAC). To increase the number of HSA molecules conjugated to one 
Uox, we employed the faster bio-orthogonal chemistry, inverse electron demand 
Diels-Alder reaction (IEDDA). We site-specifically introduced the phenylalanine 
analog with a fast-reacting tetrazine group (frTet) into position 174 of each 
subunit of Uox. We then achieved site-specific HSA conjugation to each subunit 
of Uox via IEDDA, generating Uox conjugated to four HSA molecules (Uox-HSA4), 
with a small portion of Uox conjugated to three HSA molecules (Uox-HSA3). We 
characterized Uox-HSA4 as well as Uox variants conjugated to one or two HSA 
molecules prepared via SPAAC (Uox-HSA1 or Uox-HSA2). The enzyme activity of all 
three Uox-HSA conjugates was comparable to that of unmodified Uox. We found out 
that an increase in HSA molecules conjugated to Uox (multiple albumin-conjugated 
therapeutic protein) enhanced FcRn binding and consequently prolonged the serum 
half-life in vivo. In particular, the conjugation of four HSA molecules to Uox 
led to a prominent extension of the serum half-life (over 21 h), which is about 
16-fold longer than that of Uox-WT.

OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses of introducing varicella 
and/or herpes zoster vaccination in the Swedish national vaccination programme.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analyses based on epidemiological results from a 
specifically developed transmission model.
SETTING: National vaccination programme in Sweden, over an 85- or 20-year time 
horizon depending on the vaccination strategy.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of people aged 12 months and 65-years at 
baseline.
INTERVENTIONS: Four alternative vaccination strategies; 1, not to vaccinate; 2, 
varicella vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at age 12 
months and a second dose at age 18 months; 3, herpes zoster vaccination with one 
dose of the live attenuated vaccine at 65 years of age; and 4, both vaccine 
against varicella and herpes zoster with the before-mentioned strategies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accumulated cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
for each strategy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: It would be cost-effective to vaccinate against varicella (dominant), 
but not to vaccinate against herpes zoster (ICER of EUR 200,000), assuming a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of EUR 50,000 per QALY. The incremental analysis 
between varicella vaccination only and the combined programme results in a cost 
per gained QALY of almost EUR 1.6 million.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study are central components for 
policy-relevant decision-making, and suggest that it was cost-effective to 
introduce varicella vaccination in Sweden, whereas herpes zoster vaccination 
with the live attenuated vaccine for the elderly was not cost-effective-the 
health effects of the latter vaccination cannot be considered reasonable in 
relation to its costs. Future observational and surveillance studies are needed 
to make reasonable predictions on how boosting affects the herpes zoster 
incidence in the population, and thus the cost-effectiveness of a vaccination 
programme against varicella. Also, the link between herpes zoster and sequelae 
need to be studied in more detail to include it suitably in health economic 
evaluations.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the most common diseases in the elderly 
population, and its incidence has rapidly increased with the prolongation of 
life expectancy. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for various 
cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, and damage to vascular 
function plays an initial role in its pathogenesis. This review presents the 
latest knowledge on the mechanisms of vascular injury caused by 
hyperhomocysteinemia, including oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, 
protein N-homocysteinization, and epigenetic modification, and discusses the 
therapeutic targets of natural polyphenols. Studies have shown that natural 
polyphenols in plants can reduce homocysteine levels and regulate DNA 
methylation by acting on oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum 
stress-related signaling pathways, thus improving hyperhomocysteinemia-induced 
vascular injury. Natural polyphenols obtained via daily diet are safer and have 
more practical significance in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases 
than traditional drugs.

BACKGROUND: An endpoint that has received some attention in recent 
cardiovascular trials is 'days alive and out of hospital' (DAOH). Percent DAOH 
is a natural extension of DAOH that adjusts for differences in length of 
follow-up. This endpoint measure incorporates mortality and morbidity together 
in a way that has the potential to give more insight regarding treatment effects 
compared to conventional time-to-event endpoints. Other advantages of this 
measure include the relative ease of collection and interpretation. However, 
research on how to analyze this measure is still limited.
METHODS: We propose using the one-inflated beta model to analyze percent DAOH. 
This model is appropriate for highly left-skewed data with a large proportion of 
boundary values. Data from the Prospective Comparison of ARNI [Angiotensin 
Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor] with ACEI [Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme 
Inhibitor] to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart 
Failure Trial (PARADIGM-HF) and Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of 
Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) trials are used to illustrate this 
method.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in percent DAOH were observed for 
PARADIGM-HF and CHARM in favor of treatment. In PARADIGM-HF, treatment with 
sacubitril plus valsartan increased DAOH on average by 11 days (95% CI: 1.4-20.9 
days) and increased percent DAOH by 1.64% at a fixed follow-up length of 1,000 
days (95% CI: 0.61%- 2.67%). For the CHARM overall program, the candesartan 
group has 1.79% more DAOH (95% CI: 0.91%- 2.68%).
CONCLUSION: DAOH, and especially percent DAOH, can enhance our understanding of 
treatment effects in future cardiovascular trials, and the one-inflated beta 
model is an appropriate choice for its analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analytic review was to quantitatively 
examine the effects of myofascial release technique (MFR) on pain intensity, 
back disability, lumbar range of motion, and quality of life in patients with 
low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: Potential articles were retrieved using five electronic databases (Web 
of Science, PubMed, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and 
Wanfang). The search period was from inception to January 27, 2021. Two 
researchers independently completed record retrieval and selection, data 
extraction, and methodological quality assessment. Randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) assessing the effect of MFR on pain intensity, back disability, lumbar 
range of motion, and quality of life in LBP patients were included. Pooled 
effect sizes were calculated using random effects models and 95 % confidence 
interval (95 % CI).
RESULTS: Data from eight RCTs (386 patients with back pain) meeting the 
inclusion criteria were extracted for meta-analysis with methodological quality 
assessment scores ranging from 6 to 10. Compared to the control intervention, 
MFR induced significant decrease in back disability (SMD = -0.35, 95 % 
confidence interval [CI] = -0.68, -0.02, P = 0.04, I² = 46 %, n = 284). MFR 
induced non-significant decrease in the pain intensity (SMD = -0.12, 95 % 
confidence interval[CI] = -0.35, 0.11, P = 0.32, I² = 0%, n = 294), 
non-significant improvement in quality of life (SMD = -0.09, 95 % confidence 
interval [CI] = -0.46, 0.28, P = 0.62, I² = 0%, n = 114), and non-significant 
improvement in lumbar range of motion (Flexion SMD = 0.57,95 % confidence 
interval [CI] = -0.09, 1.24, P = 0.09, I² = 54 %, n = 80) (Extension SMD = 0.68, 
95 % confidence interval[CI] = -0.72, 2.08, P = 0.34, I² = 89 %, n = 80) (Right 
flexion SMD = 0.05, 95 % confidence interval[CI] = -0.90, 0.99, P = 0.92, I² = 
78 %, n = 80) (Left flexion SMD = 0.14, 95 % confidence interval[CI] = -0.59, 
0.88, P = 0.70, I² = 64 %, n = 80).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that MFR can improve the effect of physical 
therapy alone and exercise therapy alone, and that MFR can be an effective 
adjuvant therapy. Meta-analysis showed that MFR has a significant effect on 
reducing back disability in patients with low back pain, but no significant 
effect on reducing pain intensity, improving quality of life, and improving 
lumbar range of motion.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In India, COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) have 
consistently been very high in states like Punjab and Maharashtra and very low 
in Kerala and Assam. To investigate the discrepancy in state-wise CFRs, datasets 
on various factors related to demography, socio-economy, public health, and 
healthcare capacity have been collected to study their association with CFR.
METHODS: State-wise COVID-19 data was collected till April 22, 2021. The latest 
data on the various factors have been collected from reliable sources. Pearson 
correlation, two-tailed P test, Spearman rank correlation, and Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN) structures have been used to assess the association between 
various factors and CFR.
RESULTS: Life expectancies, prevalence of overweight, COVID-19 test positive 
rates, and H1N1 fatality rates show a significant positive association with CFR. 
Human Development Index, per capita GDP, public affairs index, health 
expenditure per capita, availability of govt. doctors & hospital beds, 
prevalence of certain diseases, and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension 
show insignificant association with CFR. Sex ratio, health expenditure as a 
percent of GSDP, and availability of govt. hospitals show a significant negative 
correlation with CFR.
CONCLUSION: The study indicates that older people, males of younger age groups, 
and overweight people are at more fatality risk from COVID-19. Certain diseases 
and common comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension do not seem to have any 
significant effect on CFR. States with better COVID-19 testing rates, health 
expenditure, and healthcare capacity seem to perform better with regard to 
COVID-19 fatality rates.

University, İstanbul, Turkey

BACKGROUND/AIM: We aimed to present the clinical results of patients with 
medullary carcinoma under follow-up in our center and to determine parameters 
affecting remission and lymph node metastases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of the medical 
records of 27 patients with MTC who were followed up between 2004 and 2020.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 47.7 ± 14 years. The mean follow-up was 
7.29 ± 4.9 years. Metastatic neck lymphadenopathy was detected in eight (29.6%) 
patients; none had distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. The median tumor 
diameter was 1.50 (range: 0.4–6) cm. The median postoperative calcitonin level 
was 3.3 (range, 0.5–871) ng/L. Relapse occurred in 2 (range, 1–14) years after 
the first surgery in three (11.1%) patients. In the last visit, 7 (25.9%) 
patients had a structural incomplete response, and three (11.1%) patients had a 
biochemical incomplete response. Seventeen (59.3%) patients were in remission, 
no patients died of MTC or any other cause. Elevated postoperative calcitonin 
level was a significant prognostic parameter for remission (p = 0.12) and lymph 
node metastasis (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated postoperative calcitonin level and perithyroid soft tissue 
invasion were significant prognostic parameters for remission and lymph node 
metastasis. Postoperative calcitonin level and calcitonin doubling time should 
be considered for prognostic and survival risk assessments.

BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation can improve function in many people with chronic 
health conditions. It is important to consider priority conditions requiring 
rehabilitation, so it can be realistically positioned and costed in national 
health financing systems like South Africa (SA)'s proposed National Health 
Insurance (NHI). This paper describes temporal trends of top-ranked conditions 
on years lived with disability (YLDs) rates in SA, for which physical 
rehabilitation can ameliorate associated disability.
METHODS: This study is a systematic synthesis of publicly available Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates. The top 11 conditions contributing most 
to YLDs and for which evidence-based rehabilitation interventions exist were 
identified. Age-standardized rates per 100,000 and YLDs counts were extracted 
from 1990 to 2017. Significance of changes in temporal trends was determined 
using Mann-Kendall trend tests. Best-fit rates of yearly changes were calculated 
per condition, using GBD estimates (2012-2017), and extrapolated (by imposing 
the best-fit regression line onto results for each subsequent predicted year) as 
forecasts (2018-2022).
RESULTS: Trends for YLDs counts per condition year (1990-2017) and forecasted 
values (2018-2022) showed an overall steady increase for all conditions, except 
HIV and respiratory conditions. YLDs counts almost doubled from 1990 to 2017, 
with a 17% predicted increase from 2017 to 2022. The proportionate contribution 
to YLDs counts reduced over time for all conditions, except HIV. Although 
age-standardized YLDs rates appear relatively stable over the analyzed periods 
for all conditions (except HIV, respiratory conditions and type 2 diabetes), 
trend changes in YLDs rates over 28 years were significant for all conditions, 
except neonatal (p = 0.855), hearing loss (p = 0.100) and musculoskeletal 
conditions (p = 0.300). Significant trend decreases were apparent for 4/9 
conditions, implying that another 5/9 conditions showed trend increases over 
28 years. Predicted all-age prevalence in 2022 suggests relatively large 
increases for cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and burns, while 
relative decreases are predicted for fractures and dislocations, stroke, and 
musculoskeletal conditions.
CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation needs in SA are potentially massive and unmet, 
highlighting the need for innovative and context-specific rehabilitation that 
considers current local needs and projected changes. These findings should be 
considered when designing the NHI and other schemes in SA to ensure human and 
financial resources are deployed efficiently.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify and describe the distribution and trends of burden of 
nutritional deficiencies among children under 5 years old in China from 1990 to 
2015.
METHODS: Subnational data of China on children under 5 years old in 33 provinces 
and autonomous regions, which including 31 mainland regions, Hong Kong and Macao 
Special Administrative Regions, were extracted from the result of Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2015(GBD 2015). Based on the method of descriptive 
epidemiology, we analyzed the prevalence, mortality as well as disability 
adjusted life year(DALY) rate of nutritional deficiencies among children under 5 
years old by sex, time and locations in China, as well as its temporal trend 
since 1990.
RESULTS: In 2015, the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies among children 
under 5 years old was 17. 26%, and the DALY rate was 776. 26 person-years per 
100000. Compared to 1990, the DALY rate of nutritional deficiencies declined by 
71. 42%. The DALY rate of nutritional deficiencies decreased in the past 25 
years in Eastern, Central and Western China. Meanwhile, the gap in disease 
burden between boys and girls declined. Among diseases caused by nutritional 
deficiencies, burden of protein-energy malnutrition and iron deficiency anemia 
among children under 5 years old were relatively higher. Compared to 1990, the 
DALY rate of iron deficiency anemia among children under 5 years old declined by 
15. 68%, which was lower than other nutritional deficiencies among children in 
2015.
CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2015, the disease burden caused by nutritional 
deficiencies among Chinese children under 5 years old showed downtrend. There 
were still differences of disease burden distributions between regions and 
common nutritional deficiencies.

INTRODUCTION: The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals include the objective of 
reducing premature mortality from major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by 
one-third by 2030. Accomplishing this objective has demographic implications 
with relevance for countries' health systems and costs. However, evidence on the 
system-wide implications of NCD targets is limited.
METHODS: We developed a cohort-component model to estimate demographic change 
based on user-defined disease-specific mortality trajectories. The model 
accounts for ageing over 101 annual age cohorts, disaggregated by sex and 
projects changes in the size and structure of the population. We applied this 
model to the context of Bangladesh, using the model to simulate demographic 
outlooks for Bangladesh for 2015-2030 using three mortality scenarios. The 
'status quo' scenario entails that the disease-specific mortality profile 
observed in 2015 applies throughout 2015-2030. The 'trend' scenario adopts 
age-specific, sex-specific and disease-specific mortality rate trajectories 
projected by WHO for the region. The 'target' scenario entails a one-third 
reduction in the mortality rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and 
chronic respiratory diseases between age 30 and 70 by 2030.
RESULTS: The status quo, trend and target scenarios projected 178.9, 179.7 and 
180.2 million population in 2030, respectively. The cumulative number of deaths 
during 2015-2030 was estimated at 17.4, 16.2 and 15.6 million for each scenario, 
respectively. During 2015-2030, the target scenario would avert a cumulative 
1.73 million and 584 000 all-cause deaths compared with the status quo and trend 
scenarios, respectively. Male life expectancy was estimated to increase from 
71.10 to 73.47 years in the trend scenario and to 74.38 years in the target 
scenario; female life expectancy was estimated to increase from 73.68 to 75.34 
years and 76.39 years in the trend and target scenarios, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The model describes the demographic implications of NCD prevention 
and control targets, estimating the potential increase in life expectancy 
associated with achieving key NCD reduction targets. The results can be used to 
inform future health system needs and to support planning for increased 
healthcare coverage in countries.
