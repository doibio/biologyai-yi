dollars, of $24 056. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested intensive BP 
treatment would be cost-effective compared with standard treatment 86.7% of the 
time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $$60 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The result of this study showed that intensive BP treatment appears 
to be a cost-effective choice for patients with a high risk of CVD in Saudi 
Arabia when compared with standard treatment.

INTRODUCTION: With Zika vaccine candidates under development and women of 
childbearing age being the primary target population, now is the time to map the 
vaccine (e.g., efficacy and duration of protection) and vaccination (e.g., cost) 
characteristic thresholds at which vaccination becomes cost effective, highly 
cost effective, and cost saving.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed (to represent 2019 circumstances, US$ and 
INT$, Region of the Americas) to simulate a woman of childbearing age and the 
potential risk and clinical course of a Zika infection.
RESULTS: Compared with no vaccination, vaccination was cost effective 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: US$1,254-$82,900/disability-adjusted life 
years averted) when the risk of infection was ≥0.05%-0.08% (varying with country 
income), vaccine efficacy was ≥25%, and vaccination cost was US$1-$7,500 
(INT$5-$10,000 depending on country income level). Vaccination was dominant 
(i.e., saved costs and provided beneficial health effects) when the infection 
risk was ≥0.1% for a vaccine efficacy ≥75% and when the infection risk was ≥0.5% 
for a vaccine efficacy ≥25%, for scenarios where vaccination conferred a 1-year 
duration of protection and cost ≤$200. In some cases, the vaccine was cost 
effective when the risk was as low as 0.015%, the cost was as high as $7,500 
(INT$10,000), the efficacy was as low as 25%, and the duration of protection was 
1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: The thresholds at which vaccination becomes cost effective and cost 
saving can provide targets for Zika vaccine development and implementation.

BACKGROUND: Aging of the population and prolonged life expectancy have 
significantly increased the number of elderly patients undergoing hepatectomy 
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, potential benefits, especially 
long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy for elderly patients with HCC remain 
unclear.
METHOD: Patients treated with curative-intent hepatectomy for HCC in 8 Chinese 
hospitals were enrolled. Patients were divided into the elderly (≥70 years old) 
and younger (<70 years old) groups. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific 
survival (CSS), and time-to-recurrence (TTR) were compared. Risk factors of CSS 
and TTR were evaluated by univariable and multivariable competing-risk 
regression analyses.
RESULTS: Of 2134 patients, 259 (12.1%) and 1875 (87.9%) were elderly and younger 
aged, respectively. Postoperative 30-day and 90-day mortality was comparable 
among elderly and younger patients. Compared with younger patients, the elderly 
had a worse 5-year OS (49.4% vs. 55.3%, P = 0.032), yet a better 5-year CCS 
(74.5% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.005) and a lower 5-year TTR (33.7% vs. 44.9%, 
P < 0.001), respectively. Multivariable analyses identified that elder age was 
independently associated with more favorable CSS (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.58-0.90, 
P = 0.011) and TTR (0.69, 0.53-0.88, P < 0.001) but was not associated with OS 
(P = 0.136).
CONCLUSIONS: Age by itself is not a contraindication to surgery, and selected 
elderly patients with HCC can benefit from hepatectomy. Compared with younger 
patients, elderly patients have noninferior oncologic outcomes following 
hepatectomy for HCC.

INTRODUCTION: Mortality rates in many high-income countries have changed from 
their long-term trends since around 2011. This paper sets out a protocol for 
testing the extent to which economic austerity can explain the variance in 
recent mortality trends across high-income countries.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an ecological natural experiment study, which will 
use regression adjustment to account for differences in exposure, outcomes and 
confounding. All high-income countries with available data will be included in 
the sample. The timing of any changes in the trends for four measures of 
austerity (the Alesina-Ardagna Fiscal Index, real per capita government 
expenditure, public social spending and the cyclically adjusted primary balance) 
will be identified and the cumulative difference in exposure to these measures 
thereafter will be calculated. These will be regressed against the difference in 
the mean annual change in life expectancy, mortality rates and lifespan 
variation compared with the previous trends, with an initial lag of 2 years 
after the identified change point in the exposure measure. The role of 
underemployment and individual incomes as outcomes in their own right and as 
mediating any relationship between austerity and mortality will also be 
considered. Sensitivity analyses varying the lag period to 0 and 5 years, and 
adjusting for recession, will be undertaken.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All of the data used for this study are publicly 
available, aggregated datasets with no individuals identifiable. There is, 
therefore, no requirement for ethical committee approval for the study. The 
study will be lodged within the National Health Service research governance 
system. All results of the study will be published following sharing with 
partner agencies. No new datasets will be created as part of this work for 
deposition or curation.

PURPOSE: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is characterized by the expansion of clonal 
mast cells that infiltrate various organ systems. The extent of organ 
infiltration and subsequent organ damage distinguishes between indolent SM (ISM) 
defined by a nearly normal life expectancy and advanced SM (AdvSM) defined by 
poor prognosis. In ISM, measurement of the bone mineral density (BMD) frequently 
reveals osteoporosis. In contrast, the clinical implication of an increased BMD 
and osteosclerosis remains unclear.
METHODS: BMD was evaluated in 61 patients with mastocytosis (ISM, n = 29, 48%; 
AdvSM, n = 32, 52%). We correlated the prevalence of osteoporosis, increased BMD 
and osteosclerosis with clinical parameters, disease variant and prognosis.
RESULTS: Osteoporosis was detected in 11/29 (38%) patients with ISM but only in 
2/32 (6%) patients with AdvSM (p = 0.004). An increased BMD was detected in 1/29 
(3%) patients with ISM and 24/32 (75%) patients with AdvSM (p < 0.001) while 
osteosclerosis was only detected in AdvSM patients (16/32, 50%). AdvSM patients 
with increased BMD had higher levels of bone marrow mast cell infiltration, 
higher serum tryptase and alkaline phosphatase levels compared to ISM as well as 
higher number of high-molecular risk mutations (p < 0.05). In addition, we found 
that the prognosis of AdvSM patients with increased BMD is inferior compared to 
those without increased BMD (median overall survival 3.6 years versus not 
reached, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis is a common feature in ISM but not in AdvSM. An 
increased BMD is frequently present in AdvSM but not in ISM and is associated 
with more advanced disease and inferior outcome.

Information theory is a branch of mathematics that overlaps with communications, 
biology, and medical engineering. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty in the set 
of information. In this study, for each gene and its exons sets, the entropy was 
calculated in orders one to four. Based on the relative entropy of genes and 
exons, Kullback-Leibler divergence was calculated. After obtaining the 
Kullback-Leibler distance for genes and exons sets, the results were entered as 
input into 7 clustering algorithms: single, complete, average, weighted, 
centroid, median, and K-means. To aggregate the results of clustering, the 
AdaBoost algorithm was used. Finally, the results of the AdaBoost algorithm were 
investigated by GeneMANIA prediction server to explore the results from gene 
annotation point of view. All calculations were performed using the MATLAB 
Engineering Software (2015). Following our findings on investigating the results 
of genes metabolic pathways based on the gene annotations, it was revealed that 
our proposed clustering method yielded correct, logical, and fast results. This 
method at the same that had not had the disadvantages of aligning allowed the 
genes with actual length and content to be considered and also did not require 
high memory for large-length sequences. We believe that the performance of the 
proposed method could be used with other competitive gene clustering methods to 
group biologically relevant set of genes. Also, the proposed method can be seen 
as a predictive method for those genes bearing up weak genomic annotations.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is a progressive neurocognitive clinical syndrome that 
is caused by a decrease in cerebral blood flow and damage to the neurovascular 
unit. Given increasing life expectancy, VaD is emerging as one of the leading 
health problems in society. Despite the high global prevalence of cognitive 
impairment associated with VaD, diagnosis and treatment still remain limited 
because of the complexity of mechanisms of neuronal loss. Therefore, advances in 
our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved is crucial for 
the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we highlight the 
pathophysiology, current pharmacology-based primary and secondary prevention 
strategies and emerging treatment options for VaD.

BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases (collectively referred to 
as cirrhosis in this paper) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
globally, although the burden and underlying causes differ across locations and 
demographic groups. We report on results from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 on the burden of cirrhosis and its 
trends since 1990, by cause, sex, and age, for 195 countries and territories.
METHODS: We used data from vital registrations, vital registration samples, and 
verbal autopsies to estimate mortality. We modelled prevalence of total, 
compensated, and decompensated cirrhosis on the basis of hospital and claims 
data. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years 
of life lost due to premature death and years lived with disability. Estimates 
are presented as numbers and age-standardised or age-specific rates per 100 000 
population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). All estimates are presented 
for five causes of cirrhosis: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver 
disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other causes. We compared 
mortality, prevalence, and DALY estimates with those expected according to the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a proxy for the development status of regions 
and countries.
FINDINGS: In 2017, cirrhosis caused more than 1·32 million (95% UI 1·27-1·45) 
deaths (440 000 [416 000-518 000; 33·3%] in females and 883 000 
[838 000-967 000; 66·7%] in males) globally, compared with less than 899 000 
(829 000-948 000) deaths in 1990. Deaths due to cirrhosis constituted 2·4% 
(2·3-2·6) of total deaths globally in 2017 compared with 1·9% (1·8-2·0) in 1990. 
Despite an increase in the number of deaths, the age-standardised death rate 
decreased from 21·0 (19·2-22·3) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 16·5 
(15·8-18·1) per 100 000 population in 2017. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest 
age-standardised death rate among GBD super-regions for all years of the study 
period (32·2 [25·8-38·6] deaths per 100 000 population in 2017), and the 
high-income super-region had the lowest (10·1 [9·8-10·5] deaths per 100 000 
population in 2017). The age-standardised death rate decreased or remained 
constant from 1990 to 2017 in all GBD regions except eastern Europe and central 
Asia, where the age-standardised death rate increased, primarily due to 
increases in alcohol-related liver disease prevalence. At the national level, 
the age-standardised death rate of cirrhosis was lowest in Singapore in 2017 
(3·7 [3·3-4·0] per 100 000 in 2017) and highest in Egypt in all years since 1990 
(103·3 [64·4-133·4] per 100 000 in 2017). There were 10·6 million (10·3-10·9) 
prevalent cases of decompensated cirrhosis and 112 million (107-119) prevalent 
cases of compensated cirrhosis globally in 2017. There was a significant 
increase in age-standardised prevalence rate of decompensated cirrhosis between 
1990 and 2017. Cirrhosis caused by NASH had a steady age-standardised death rate 
throughout the study period, whereas the other four causes showed declines in 
age-standardised death rate. The age-standardised prevalence of compensated and 
decompensated cirrhosis due to NASH increased more than for any other cause of 
cirrhosis (by 33·2% for compensated cirrhosis and 54·8% for decompensated 
cirrhosis) over the study period. From 1990 to 2017, the number of prevalent 
cases more than doubled for compensated cirrhosis due to NASH and more than 
tripled for decompensated cirrhosis due to NASH. In 2017, age-standardised death 
and DALY rates were lower among countries and territories with higher SDI.
INTERPRETATION: Cirrhosis imposes a substantial health burden on many countries 
and this burden has increased at the global level since 1990, partly due to 
population growth and ageing. Although the age-standardised death and DALY rates 
of cirrhosis decreased from 1990 to 2017, numbers of deaths and DALYs and the 
proportion of all global deaths due to cirrhosis increased. Despite the 
availability of effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of 
hepatitis B and C, they were still the main causes of cirrhosis burden 
worldwide, particularly in low-income countries. The impact of hepatitis B and C 
is expected to be attenuated and overtaken by that of NASH in the near future. 
Cost-effective interventions are required to continue the prevention and 
treatment of viral hepatitis, and to achieve early diagnosis and prevention of 
cirrhosis due to alcohol-related liver disease and NASH.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases remain a problem of the modern medical 
community. Mortality from cardiovascular disease is at the forefront in the 
structure of the causes of mortality, so active support for the prevention and 
treatment of this group of diseases is the most effective measure as it will 
affect the continuation of life expectancy. The aim: To analyze features and 
patterns of cardiovascular disease in the Carpathian region.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The features of the course and treatment of acute coronary 
syndrome in the period 2014-2018 in the Ivano-Frankivsk region are analyzed. 
Clinicalanamnestic, geographical, demographic, the effectiveness of patient 
care, statistical and acute coronary syndrome registry data were studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventive activities, both primary and secondary, with the 
promotion of knowledge on the preservation and strengthening of health, are a 
guarantee of positive progress in overcoming cardiovascular diseases. Creation 
of rehabilitation centers with a multidisciplinary approach, along with medical 
and physical interventions of psychological support and training, will 
contribute to the improvement and prevention of complications of cardiovascular 
disease. The cooperation of cardiological communities between the regions has a 
social and medical significance, namely the training of specialists, the 
exchange of experience, scientific projects with the medical community of Opole 
Voivodship is one of the directions of increasing the efficiency of treatment of 
cardiological patients.

BACKGROUND: The holistic management of tuberculosis (TB) patients can improve 
life expectancy and lost organ function.
REHABILITATION: Chronic sequelae are very common among patients who survive TB, 
which can lead to a further decline in lung function. There is still no guidance 
for 'cured' patients with impaired lung function who need pulmonary 
rehabilitation. Additional tests for evaluation should be given after the end of 
treatment, as recent studies have shown the good effect of pulmonary 
rehabilitation for TB patients.
OPTIMIZED NUTRITIONAL CARE: Malnutrition is very common among TB patients and is 
related to malabsorption. The latter can cause lower drug exposure, which may 
result in treatment failure, increasing the risk of death, and can lead to 
acquired drug resistance. Malnutrition should be assessed according to the 
Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria and the diagnosis 
should lead to an individualized treatment plan, including sufficient proteins 
and preferably in combination with adequate training.
PROTECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES: Under normal circumstances, most immune cells use a 
glucose-based mechanism to generate energy. Therefore the patient's nutritional 
status is a key factor in shaping immune responses. Disease-related malnutrition 
leads to proteolysis and lipolysis. In the end, the identification of 
individuals who will benefit from immune-modulatory strategies may lead to 
clinically relevant markers.

OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve disease is the most frequent indication for heart valve 
replacement with the highest prevalence in elderly. Tissue-engineered heart 
valves (TEHV) are foreseen to have important advantages over currently used 
bioprosthetic heart valve substitutes, most importantly reducing valve 
degeneration with subsequent reduction of re-intervention. We performed early 
Health Technology Assessment of hypothetical TEHV in elderly patients 
(≥ 70 years) requiring surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) to assess the potential of TEHV and to inform future 
development decisions.
METHODS: Using a patient-level simulation model, the potential 
cost-effectiveness of TEHV compared with bioprostheses was predicted from a 
societal perspective. Anticipated, but currently hypothetical improvements in 
performance of TEHV, divided in durability, thrombogenicity, and infection 
resistance, were explored in scenario analyses to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gain, cost reduction, headroom, and budget impact.
RESULTS: Durability of TEHV had the highest impact on QALY gain and costs, 
followed by infection resistance. Improved TEHV performance (- 50% prosthetic 
valve-related events) resulted in lifetime QALY gains of 0.131 and 0.043, 
lifetime cost reductions of €639 and €368, translating to headrooms of €3255 and 
€2498 per hypothetical TEHV compared to SAVR and TAVI, respectively. National 
savings in the first decade after implementation varied between €2.8 and €11.2 
million (SAVR) and €3.2-€12.8 million (TAVI) for TEHV substitution rates of 
25-100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively short life expectancy of elderly patients 
undergoing SAVR/TAVI, hypothetical TEHV are predicted to be cost-effective 
compared to bioprostheses, commercially viable and result in national cost 
savings when biomedical engineers succeed in realising improved durability 
and/or infection resistance of TEHV.

PURPOSE: To explore the selection, use, and reporting of theories, models, and 
frameworks (TMFs) in implementation studies that promoted healthy eating in 
center-based childcare.
DATA SOURCE: We searched 11 databases for articles published between January 
1990 and October 2018. We also conducted a hand search of studies and consulted 
subject matter experts.
STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: We included studies in center-based 
settings for preschoolers that addressed the development, delivery, or 
evaluation of interventions or implementation strategies related to healthy 
eating and related subjects and that explicitly used TMF. Exclusion criteria 
include not peer reviewed or abstracts and not in English, French, German, and 
Korean.
DATA EXTRACTION: The first author extracted the data using extraction forms. A 
second reviewer verified data extraction.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Direct content analysis and narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: We identified 8222 references. We retained 38 studies. Study designs 
included quasi-experimental, randomized controlled trials, surveys, case 
studies, and others. The criteria used most often for selecting TMFs were 
description of a change process (n = 12; 23%) or process guidance (n = 8; 15%). 
Theories, models, and frameworks used targeted different socioecological levels 
and purposes. The application of TMF constructs (e.g., factors, steps, outcomes) 
was reported 69% (n = 34) of times.
CONCLUSION: Reliance on TMFs focused on individual-level, poor TMF selection, 
and application and reporting for the development of implementation strategies 
could limit TMF utility.

For lifetime protection against diphtheria and tetanus, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) recommends six doses of diphtheria and tetanus containing 
vaccines. Td (reduced diphtheria toxoid, ≥2-5 IU) vaccines are currently 
licensed for ages 7 years and older, but use of Td vaccine for ages 4 years and 
older would have advantages for immunization programs in many low- and 
middle-income countries. For this reason, WHO convened an expert consultation to 
review the currently available evidence for the use of Td vaccine from 4 to 
7 years of age which concluded: (1) no relevant biological difference in immune 
response in the relevant age group compared with children over 7 years of age; 
(2) adequate seroprotection in several studies with Td vaccine in the 4-7 age 
group and many studies using combination vaccines; (3) durable and protective 
response of at least 9-11 years duration in several longitudinal and modelling 
studies, (4) less reactogenicity compared with use of full-dose diphtheria 
vaccine, potentially improving the vaccination experience; and (5) adequate 
control of diphtheria in several countries using Td-containing combination 
vaccines in 4-7 year old children. On this basis, the experts concluded that 
from a programmatic perspective, Td vaccine given in ages 4-7 years, as a second 
booster dose in a six-dose series, would provide adequate protection against 
diphtheria and tetanus and recommended steps to include this change in age 
extension listed in the package insert.

Polypharmacy is a well-described problem in the geriatric population. It is a 
relatively new problem for people living with HIV (PLWH), as this group now has 
a life expectancy approaching that of the general population. Defining 
polypharmacy for PLWH is difficult, since the most common traditional definition 
of at least five medications would encompass a large percentage of PLWH who are 
on antiretrovirals (ARVs) and medications for other medical comorbidities. Even 
when excluding ARVs, the prevalence of polypharmacy in PLWH is higher than the 
general population, and not just in resource-rich countries. Using a more 
nuanced approach with "appropriate" or "safer" polypharmacy allows for a better 
framework for discussing how to mitigate the associated risks. Some of the 
consequences of polypharmacy include adverse effects of medications including 
the risk of geriatric syndromes, drug-drug interactions, decreased adherence, 
and over- and undertreatment of medical comorbidities. Interventions to combat 
polypharmacy include decreasing pill burden-specifically with fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) tablets- and medication reconciliation/deprescription using 
established criteria. The goal of these interventions is to decrease drug 
interactions and improve quality of life and outcomes. Some special populations 
of interest within the community of PLWH include those with chronic pain, 
substance abuse, or requiring end of life care. A final look into the future of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) shows the promise of possible two-drug regimens, 
which can help reduce the above risks of polypharmacy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, ~50% are undiagnosed in England and 
linkage-to-care is poor. This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of an 
intervention (HepCATT) to improve case-finding and referral to HCV treatment 
compared with standard-of-care pathways in drug treatment centres in England.
DESIGN: HCV transmission and disease progression model with cost-effectiveness 
analysis using a health-care perspective. Primary outcome and cost data from the 
HepCATT study parameterized the intervention, suggesting that HepCATT increased 
HCV testing in drug treatment centres 2.5-fold and engagement onto the HCV 
treatment pathway 10-fold. A model was used to estimate the decrease in HCV 
infections and HCV-related deaths from 2016, with costs and health benefits 
(quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) tracked over 50 years. Univariable and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were undertaken.
SETTING: England-specific epidemic with 40% prevalence of chronic HCV among 
PWID.
PARTICIPANTS: PWID attending drug treatment centres.
INTERVENTION: Nurse facilitator in drug treatment centres to improve the HCV 
care pathway from HCV case-finding to referral and linkage to specialist care. 
Comparator was the standard-of-care HCV care pathway.
MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per 
QALY gained through improved case-finding.
FINDINGS: Over 50 years per 1000 PWID, the HepCATT intervention could prevent 75 
(95% central interval 37-129) deaths and 1330 (827-2040) or 51% (30-67%) of all 
new infections. The mean ICER was £7986 per QALY gained, with all PSA 
simulations being cost-effective at a £20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold. Univariable sensitivity analyses suggest the intervention would 
become cost-saving if the cost of HCV treatment reduces to £3900. If scaled up 
to all PWID in England, the intervention would cost £8.8 million and decrease 
incidence by 56% (33-70%) by 2030.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing hepatitis C virus infection case-finding and treatment 
referral in drug treatment centres could be a highly cost-effective strategy for 
decreasing hepatitis C virus incidence among people who inject drugs.

Introduction: Over the last few years, in the development of neonatology, the 
limits to which it is possible to sustain the lives of premature babies have 
been extended, and thus the proportion of survivors with chronic morbidities has 
increased. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) 
and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), all of which deeply influence the quality 
of life, life expectancy and social integration, are the most significant 
morbidities among premature newborns. Aim: Description of psychomotor 
development of low birth weight (<2500 g) premature infants at the age of 2 
years, in relation to the most common chronic morbidities. Method: Psychomotor 
development (Brunet-Lézine scale, 1980) of low-birth-weight preterm infants at 
the age of 2 years (n = 200) was measured and the neonatal final reports were 
analysed retrospectively. Results: After age correction, birth weight positively 
correlated with the developmental quotient (DQ), while the length of stay in 
hospital correlated negatively. Grades I/II of neonatal IVH were not significant 
predictors of lower DQ, while the opposite was true for grades III/IV. We 
identified a similar relationship with the stages of ROP. According to the 
result of the homogeneity test, we can consider the independent effects of 
significant diseases. We also observed that the more diagnoses the premature 
baby received, the more they are at risk of later developmental delay at the age 
of 2 years. Conclusions: We recommend the early childhood interventions of the 
most vulnerable children of ≤1500 g birth weight with severe ROP and IVH - to 
reduce deficiencies in capabilities and prevent future mental and motor 
difficulties. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(5): 183-192.

Publisher: Absztrakt: Bevezetés: A neonatológia fejlődésével a koraszülöttek 
életben tarthatóságának határai kitolódtak, így nőtt az utóbetegségekkel túlélők 
aránya. A koraszülöttek későbbi életminőségét, életkilátásait és szociális 
integrációját leginkább befolyásoló kórképek a retinopathia prematurorum (ROP), 
az intraventricularis haemorrhagia (IVH) és a bronchopulmonalis dysplasia (BPD). 
Célkitűzés: A 2500 gramm alatti születési súlyú (LBW) kisgyermekek kétéves kori 
pszichomotoros fejlődésének leírása a leggyakoribb utóbetegségek (ROP, IVH, BPD) 
tekintetében. Módszer: Vizsgálati mintánkat 200 LBW-kisgyermek alkotta kétéves 
korban. A pszichomotoros készségeket a Brunet–Lézine-féle fejlődési skálával 
mértük fel, valamint az újszülöttkori zárójelentéseket elemeztük retrospektív 
módon. Eredmények: A születési súly az életkori korrekciót követően is pozitívan 
korrelált a kétéves kori fejlődési kvócienssel (FQ), míg a kórházi tartózkodás 
hossza negatívan. Az utóbetegségek közül az I/II. stádiumú újszülöttkori IVH 
nem, a III/IV. stádiumú azonban szignifikáns előrejelzőnek bizonyult az 
alacsonyabb FQ tekintetében. Hasonló összefüggést találtunk a ROP stádiumaival 
is, az enyhe fokú nem, a III/IV-es azonban szignifikánsan befolyásolta a kétéves 
kori pszichomotoros fejlettségi szintet. A BPD-nek nem találtuk jelentős 
összefüggését az FQ-val. A szignifikánsnak talált kórképek homogenitásvizsgálata 
azt mutatta, hogy egymástól független hatásokról beszélhetünk. Alátámasztottuk 
továbbá azon összefüggést, miszerint egy koraszülött minél több betegségben 
szenved, annál veszélyeztetettebb a későbbi fejlődési elmaradás tekintetében. 
Következtetés: Ajánljuk az 1500 gramm alatti születési súlyú gyermekek körében a 
fejlődésük szempontjából leginkább veszélyeztetettek – mint az újszülöttkori 
súlyos ROP-on és IVH-n átesettek – minél korábbi életszakaszban történő korai 
fejlesztését az esetleges képességdeficitek csökkentése érdekében és fejlődésük 
utánkövetését, így megelőzve későbbi mentális, motoros nehézségeket. Orv Hetil.

Mortality in type 1 diabetes, although showing a declining trend, is 
significantly higher than standard mortality. The case study focuses on a woman 
who lived for 91 years; she was insulin-dependent for 86 years and has been 
treated by a single physician - the author - for over 55 years. She was 
diagnosed with diabetes in 1932 at the age of five. Her diabetes was first 
treated with rapid-acting insulin three times daily, then from 1940 with 
rapid-acting and protamine zinc insulin once daily, while later on pork, then 
human crystalline zinc insulin was used, followed by a mixture of rapid-acting 
and NPH insulin for the last 16 years. The reason behind the above treatment 
regimen was that the patient obsessively insisted on a once daily insulin dose 
and the duration was shown to be 24 hours for each insulin. The continuous 
overdose of a single insulin for decades has resulted in hypoglycemic episodes 
almost daily, with consequent high fluctuations in blood glucose levels. She 
performed urine glucose tests using a polarimeter from the mid-1930s to the 
sixties, then used test strips until the early eighties, and later switched to 
blood glucose self-testing. Her HbA1c levels have been around 7% (53 mmol/mol) 
for the last 25 years. She did not develop retinopathy or nephropathy, only 
severe neuropathy caused complaints during the last years of her life. In 
addition, her vision continued to deteriorate due to age-related dry macular 
degeneration. She is a Joslin 75-year medalist. For the last two months of her 
life, she gave permission for degludec + glulisine insulin intensive treatment. 
Her death was caused by myocardial infarction. Although minimizing blood glucose 
fluctuations and sustaining good metabolic control significantly improve the 
life expectancy of people with diabetes, in our case neither has existed for 
well over half a century. Therefore, no explanation was found for the extremely 
long duration of diabetes and longevity. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(5): 193-197.

Publisher: Absztrakt: Az 1-es típusú diabetes mortalitása, bár csökkenő 
tendenciát mutatva, jelentősen meghaladja a standard mortalitást. Ez egyúttal a 
diabetesszel megélt életévek rövidülésével jár együtt. Az esetismertetés tárgya 
egy 86 éves diabetestartammal a 91. életévét megélő nőbeteg, akit több mint 55 
éven keresztül egyetlen orvos – a szerző – kezelt/gondozott. Az 1932-ben, ötéves 
korában fellépett diabetest először naponta háromszor adagolt gyors hatású 
inzulinnal, majd 1940-től kezdve naponta egyszer alkalmazott gyors hatású és 
cink-protamin inzulinnal, később sertés, majd humán kristályos cinkinzulinnal, 
majd az utolsó 16 évben gyors hatású NPH-inzulin keverékével kezelték. Ennek oka 
az volt, hogy a beteg rögeszmésen ragaszkodott a napi egyszeri inzulinadáshoz, 
és hogy esetében mindegyik inzulin hatástartama 24 órásnak bizonyult. Az 
évtizedeken át folyamatosan túladagolt egyszeri inzulinadás következménye a 
szinte naponta, főként az éjjeli órákban fellépő hypoglykaemia lett, 
következményes nagyfokú vércukor-ingadozásokkal. Az 1930-as évek közepétől a 
hatvanas évekig polarimetriás, majd száraz kémiás módszerrel 
vizeletcukor-önellenőrzést végzett a nyolcvanas évek elejéig, majd áttért a 
vércukor-önellenőrzésre. Az ötvenes években két sikertelen terhessége volt, 
2010–11-ben egymás után jobb, majd bal oldali combnyaktörést szenvedett, majd 
mindkét szemén megműtötték a cataractáját. Az utolsó 25 évben HbA1c-szintje 7% 
körül mozgott. Sem retinopathia, sem nephropathia nem fejlődött ki nála, csupán 
súlyos neuropathia okozott panaszokat az utolsó években. Emellett időskori 
száraz maculadegeneratiója miatt látása folyamatosan romlott. Elnyerte a ’Joslin 
75’ medált is. Élete utolsó két hónapjában engedte, hogy degludek + glulizin 
inzulinnal intenzíven kezeljék. Halálát myocardialis infarctus okozta. Bár a 
vércukor-ingadozások minimalizálása és a tartósan jó anyagcsere-vezetés 
jelentősen javítja a diabetesesek életkilátásait, esetünkben jó fél évszázadon 
keresztül egyik sem állt fenn. Ezért az extrém hosszú diabetestartamra nem 
találtunk magyarázatot. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(5): 193–197.

Primary liver cancer is difficult to diagnose accurately at death, due to 
metastases from nearby organs and to concomitant diseases, such as chronic 
hepatitis and cirrhosis. Trends in diagnostic accuracy could affect radiation 
risk estimates for incident liver cancer by altering background rates or by 
impacting risk modification by sex and age. We quantified the potential impact 
of death-certificate inaccuracies on radiation risk estimates for liver cancer 
in the Life Span Study of atomic bomb survivors. True-positive and 
false-negative rates were obtained from a previous study that compared 
death-certificate causes of death with those based on pathological review, from 
1958 to 1987. We assumed various scenarios for misclassification rates after 
1987. We obtained estimated true positives and estimated false negatives by 
stratified sampling from binomial distributions with probabilities given by the 
true-positive and false-negative rates, respectively. Poisson regression methods 
were applied to highly stratified person-year tables of corrected case counts
