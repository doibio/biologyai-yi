PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness within the United States health care 
system of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair versus reverse total shoulder 
arthroplasty in patients with symptomatic large and massive rotator cuff tears 
without cuff-tear arthropathy.
METHODS: An expected-value decision analysis was constructed comparing the costs 
and outcomes of patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and reverse 
total shoulder arthroplasty for large and massive rotator cuff tears (and 
excluding cases of cuff-tear arthropathy). Comprehensive literature search 
provided input data to extrapolate costs and health utility states for these 
outcomes. The primary outcome assessed was that of incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty versus 
rotator cuff repair.
RESULTS: For the base case, both arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and reverse 
total shoulder were superior to nonoperative care, with an ICER of 
$15,500/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $37,400/QALY, respectively. 
Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was dominant over primary reverse total 
shoulder arthroplasty, with lower costs and slightly improved clinical outcomes. 
Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was the preferred strategy as long as the 
lifetime progression rate from retear to end-stage cuff-tear arthropathy was 
less than 89%. However, when the model was modified to account for worse 
outcomes when reverse shoulder arthroplasty was performed after a failed 
attempted rotator cuff repair, primary reverse total shoulder had superior 
outcomes with an ICER of $90,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair-despite high rates of tendon 
retearing-for patients with large and massive rotator cuff tears may be a more 
cost-effective initial treatment strategy when compared with primary reverse 
total shoulder arthroplasty and when assuming no detrimental impact of previous 
surgery on outcomes after arthroplasty. Clinical judgment should still be 
prioritized when formulating treatment plans for these patients. LEVEL OF 
EVIDENCE: Level II, economic decision analysis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies report correlation of ankle brachial index 
(ABI) values and mortality. However, no studies exist on the predictive value of 
anatomical distribution of atherosclerotic lesions and the extent of 
atherosclerosis at defined arterial segments on life expectancy. The aim of the 
present study was to evaluate the significance of both extent and localisation 
of atherosclerotic lesions to mid-term patient survival.
METHODS: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images of 887 consecutive 
patients admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery at Turku University 
Hospital (Turku, Finland) were retrospectively analysed. Each angiography was 
classified according to the TASC II classification for aorto-iliac and 
femoro-popliteal segments, and a similar four-grade index was created for crural 
arteries. Patients were followed until 36-months post DSA.
RESULTS: During 36-month follow-up 295 (33%) deaths occurred. Death during 
follow-up was strongly associated with extensive crural disease, but not with 
extensive proximal disease (Crural Index III-IV, p = 0.044 and < 0.001, 
respectively). In a Cox regression analysis incorporating baseline variables, 
Crural Index IV and most severe atherosclerosis on crural vessels were the 
strongest predictors of poor prognosis (HR 2.20 95% CI 1.3-3.7, p = 0.003 and HR 
2.45 95% CI 1.5-4.0, p < 0.001 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The extent of crural atherosclerosis is independently associated 
with poor mid term life expectancy. Therefore, a classification of the extent of 
crural atherosclerosis could serve as an indicator of mortality among PAD 
patients and aid in clinical decision making.

Human life expectancy has been steadily increasing at a rapid rate, but this 
increasing life span also brings about increases in diseases, dementia, and 
disability. A global burden of disease 2010 study revealed that hip and knee 
osteoarthritis ranked the 11th highest in terms of years lived with disability. 
Wear and tear can greatly influence the quality of life during ageing. In 
particular, wear and tear of the articular cartilage have adverse effects on 
joints and result in osteoarthritis. The articular cartilage uses longevity of 
type II collagen as the foundation around which turnover of proteoglycans and 
the homeostatic activity of chondrocytes play central roles thereby maintaining 
the function of articular cartilage in the ageing. The longevity of type II 
collagen involves a complex interaction of the scaffolding needs of the 
cartilage and its biochemical, structural and mechanical characteristics. The 
covalent cross-linking of heterotypic polymers of collagens type II, type IX and 
type XI hold together cartilage, allowing it to withstand ageing stresses. 
Discerning the biological clues in the armamentarium for preserving cartilage 
appears to be collagen cross-linking. Therapeutic methods to crosslink in 
in-vivo are non-existent. However intra-articular injections of polyphenols in 
vivo stabilize the cartilage and make it resistant to degradation, opening a new 
therapeutic possibility for prevention and intervention of cartilage degradation 
in osteoarthritis of aging.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 12-month 
rehabilitation with low loading program on chronic respiratory disease. 
[Subjects and Methods] Twelve patients with chronic respiratory disease 
participated in this study, in which the effect of long-term rehabilitation for 
12 months was assessed. Nine patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
two had asthma, and one had interstitial pneumonia. In all patients, symptoms, 
lower-extremity strength, walking distance, activities of daily living, and 
quality of life were investigated to examine the effect of respiratory 
rehabilitation. [Results] After 12 months, the isometric knee extension strength 
and weight-bearing index both showed a significant increase. [Conclusion] The 
findings of this study suggested that improvement in lower-limb muscle strength 
can be achieved through long-term intervention, and indicated the validity of 
repetitive standing and walking exercises.

The aim of the current study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of 
whole-body fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in detecting carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) with 
bone metastases. We evaluated 87 patients who were referred to FDG-PET/CT 
imaging and reported to have skeletal lesions with suspicion of malignancy. The 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, 
and accuracy were calculated. The median survival rate was measured to evaluate 
the prognostic value of the FDG-PET/CT findings. In the search for a primary, 
FDG-PET/CT findings correctly diagnosed lesions as the site of the primary true 
positive (TP) in 64 (73%) cases, 4 (5%) findings diagnosed no site of a primary, 
and none were subsequently proven to be true negative (TN); 14 (16%) diagnoses 
were false positive (FP) and 5 (6%) diagnoses were false negative (FN). Life 
expectancy was between 2 months and 25 months. Whole-body FDG-PET/CT imaging may 
be a useful method in assessing the bone lesions with suspicion of bone 
metastases.

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a multifactorial and disabling disorder 
with complex etiology and pathogenesis. Goals of therapy in CRPS should be pain 
relief, functional restoration, and psychological stabilization, but early 
interventions are needed in order to achieve these objectives. Several drugs 
have been used to reduce pain and to improve functional status in CRPS, despite 
the lack of scientific evidence supporting their use in this scenario. They 
include anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, anesthetics, anticonvulsants, 
antidepressants, oral muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, calcitonin, 
bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers and topical agents. NSAIDs showed no 
value in treating CRPS. Glucocorticoids are the only anti-inflammatory drugs for 
which there is direct clinical trial evidence in early stage of CRPS. Opioids 
are a reasonable second or third-line treatment option, but tolerance and long 
term toxicity are unresolved issues. The use of anticonvulsants and tricyclic 
antidepressants has not been well investigated for pain management in CRPS. 
During the last years, bisphosphonates have been the mostly studied 
pharmacologic agents in CRPS treatment and there are good evidence to support 
their use in this condition. Recently, the efficacy of intravenous (IV) 
administration of neridronate has been reported in a randomized controlled 
trial. Significant improvements in VAS score and other indices of pain and 
quality of life in patients who received four 100 mg IV doses of neridronate 
versus placebo were reported. These findings were confirmed in the 
open-extension phase of the study, when patients formerly enrolled in the 
placebo group received neridronate at the same dosage, and these results were 
maintained at 1 year follow-up. The current literature concerning sympathetic 
blocks and sympathectomy techniques lacks evidence of efficacy. Low evidence was 
recorded for a free radical scavenger, dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) cream (50%). 
The same level of efficacy was noted for vitamin C (500 mg per day for 50 days) 
in prevention of CRPS in patients affected by wrist fracture. In conclusion, the 
best available therapeutic approach to CRPS is multimodal and is based on the 
use of several classes of drugs, associated to early physiotherapy. Neridronate 
at appropriate doses is associated with clinically relevant and persistent 
benefits in CRPS patients.

Refined Spruce Resin to Treat Chronic Wounds: Rebirth of an Old Folkloristic 
Therapy.

Significance: The treatment of chronic wounds results in an enormous drain on 
healthcare resources in terms of workload, costs, frustration, and impaired 
quality of life, and it presents a clinical challenge for physicians worldwide. 
Effective local treatment of a chronic wound has an important role, particularly 
in patients who are-because of their poor general condition, diminished life 
expectancy, or unacceptable operative risk-outside of surgical treatment. Recent 
Advances: Since 2002, our multidisciplinary research group has investigated the 
properties of Norway spruce (Picea abies) resin in wound healing and its 
therapeutic applications in wound care. Resin is a complex mixture of resin 
acids (e.g., abietic, neoabietic, dehydroabietic, pimaric, isopimaric, 
levopimaric, sandrakopimaric, and palustric acids) and lignans (e.g., pino-, 
larici-, matairesinol, and p-hydroxycinnamic acid) having substantial 
antimicrobial, wound-healing, and skin regeneration enhancing properties. 
Critical Issues: The cornerstone in successful wound care is an efficient causal 
treatment of the underlying co-morbidities, for example, diabetes, malnutrition, 
vascular- or certain systemic diseases. However, definitive diagnosis and 
specific therapy of a chronic wound is often difficult, because the etiology is 
practically always multi-factorial, and in the chronic phase, confounding 
factors such as infections invariably impede wound healing. Future Directions: 
To study the exact molecular mechanism of actions by which resin promotes 
cellular regeneration and epithelialization during the wound-healing process. To 
investigate potential antimicrobial properties of resin against the most ominous 
multidrug-resistant beta-lactamase (including carbapenemases and 
metallo-β-lactamases) producing bacteria, and to individualize those 
pharmacologically active compounds which are responsible for the antimicrobial 
activity of resin.

INTRODUCTION: Pomegranate is considered "A pharmacy unto itself". Hydrolysable 
tannins called punicalagins which have free scavenging properties are the most 
abundant polyphenols found in pomegranate-containing mouthwash.
AIM: To evaluate antimicrobial effect of pomegranate- containing mouthwash on 
oral biofilm-forming bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouthwashes used were divided into three groups- 
Group A: Chlorhexidine mouthwash (Hexidine); Group B: Herbal Mouthwash (Hiora) 
and Group C: Pomegranate-containing Mouthwash (Life-extension). Each mouthwash 
was diluted to five different concentrations. Reference strains of Streptococcus 
mutans (S.mutans) (ATCC 25175), Streptococcus salivarius (S.salivarius) (ATCC 
7073), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) (NCTC 9710) were selected 
as being colonizers in dental biofilm formation. On each culture plate, five 
wells of 5mm were prepared and mouthwashes with different concentrations were 
added, followed by incubation in a CO2 jar for 24 hours at 37°C. Inhibition zone 
diameters were measured using a digital caliper.
RESULTS: Chlorhexidine (0.12%) presented a zone of inhibition between 38.46% to 
96.15% for all the three organisms, while Hiora presented zone of inhibition 
ranging from 33.33% to 69.23% but was resistant at <10 ml of dilution. 
Pomegranate mouthwash presented a zone of inhibition ranging from 38.48 to 
57.69%, but was resistant at <10ml for S.mutans, and <25ml for A.a and 
S.salivarius. ANOVA test was done to compare the dilution of mouthwashes for a 
particular organism and Tukey's multiple comparison tests were done to find the 
exact difference. A significant difference was seen between all the three groups 
at 50ml and 75 ml of dilution. At 75 ml concentration, a statistical difference 
was found between Groups B & C and Groups A & B; and at 50 ml between Groups 
A&C.
CONCLUSION: All the three types of mouthwash exhibit anti-microbial activity 
against biofilm forming organisms but at varying concentrations. Although 
Chlorhexidine still continues to be the gold standard, pomegranate-containing or 
herbal mouthwashes can be easily substituted for long term use, avoiding the 
side effects of chlorhexidine.

Branching determines the final shape of plants, which influences adaptation, 
survival and the visual quality of many species. It is an intricate process that 
includes bud outgrowth and shoot extension, and these in turn respond to 
environmental cues and light conditions. Light is a powerful environmental 
factor that impacts multiple processes throughout plant life. The molecular 
basis of the perception and transduction of the light signal within buds is 
poorly understood and undoubtedly requires to be further unravelled. This review 
is based on current knowledge on bud outgrowth-related mechanisms and 
light-mediated regulation of many physiological processes. It provides an 
extensive, though not exhaustive, overview of the findings related to this 
field. In parallel, it points to issues to be addressed in the near future.

Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion for Adjacent Segment Disease: Clinical 
Outcomes and Cost Utility of Surgical Intervention.

University School of Medicine‡Department of Neurosurgery, Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center, Nashville, TN.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
OBJECTIVE: Determine clinical outcomes and cost utility of anterior cervical 
discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of adjacent segment disease 
(ASD).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The incidence of symptomatic ASD after ACDF has been 
estimated to occur in up to 26% of patients. Commonly, these patients will 
undergo an additional ACDF procedure. However, there are currently no studies 
available that adequately describe the clinical outcomes or cost utility of 
performing ACDF for ASD.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 40 patients undergoing ACDF for ASD was 
performed. Baseline and 2-year neck and arm pain (NRS-NP, NRS-AP), neck 
disability index (NDI), physical and mental quality of life (SF-12 PCS & MCS), 
and Zung depression score (ZDS) were assessed. Two-year total neck-related 
medical resource utilization, amount of missed work, and health-state values 
were determined. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from EQ-5D 
assessments with US valuation. Comprehensive costs (indirect, direct, and total 
cost) and the value (cost-per-QALY gained) of performing ACDF for ASD were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Performing ACDF to treat ASD resulted in significant improvements 
(P<0.05) in NRS-NP, NRS-AP, NDI, SF-12 PCS, and ZDS outcome measures. 
Patient-reported health states also significantly improved, with a mean 
cumulative 2-year gain of 0.54 QALYs. The mean 2-year cost of surgery was 
$32,616 (direct cost: $25,391; indirect cost: $7225). ACDF for the treatment of 
ASD was associated with a mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $60,526.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing ACDF for ASD resulted in significant improvements in 
patient pain, disability, and quality of life. Further, the mean 2-year 
cost-per-QALY was determined to be $60,526, which suggests surgical intervention 
to be cost effective. This study is the first to provide evidence that 
performing an ACDF for ASD is both clinically and cost effective.

Early or late pubertal onset affects up to 5% of adolescents and is associated 
with adverse health and psychosocial outcomes. Self-limited delayed puberty (DP) 
segregates predominantly in an autosomal dominant pattern, but the underlying 
genetic background is unknown. Using exome and candidate gene sequencing, we 
have identified rare mutations in IGSF10 in 6 unrelated families, which resulted 
in intracellular retention with failure in the secretion of mutant proteins. 
IGSF10 mRNA was strongly expressed in embryonic nasal mesenchyme, during 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal migration to the hypothalamus. 
IGSF10 knockdown caused a reduced migration of immature GnRH neurons in vitro, 
and perturbed migration and extension of GnRH neurons in a gnrh3:EGFP zebrafish 
model. Additionally, loss-of-function mutations in IGSF10 were identified in 
hypothalamic amenorrhea patients. Our evidence strongly suggests that mutations 
in IGSF10 cause DP in humans, and points to a common genetic basis for 
conditions of functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). While dysregulation 
of GnRH neuronal migration is known to cause permanent HH, this is the first 
time that this has been demonstrated as a causal mechanism in DP‡.

OBJECTIVES: To examine gender and regional differences in health expectancies 
based on the measure of mobility.
METHODS: Health expectancies by gender and region were computed by Sullivan's 
method from the fourth Thai National Health Examination Survey (2009). A total 
of 9,210 older persons aged 60 years and older were included. Mobility 
limitation was defined as self-reporting of ability to perform only with 
assistances/aids at least one of: walking at least 400 metres; or going up or 
down a flight of 10 stairs. Severe limitation was defined as complete inability 
to do at least one of these two functions, even with assistances or aids.
RESULTS: At age 60, females compared to males, spent significantly fewer years 
without mobility limitation (male-female = 3.2 years) and more years with any 
limitation (female-male = 6.7 years) and with severe limitation (female-male = 
3.2 years). For both genders, years lived with severe limitation were remarkably 
constant across age. Significant regional inequalities in years lived without 
and with limitation were evident, with a consistent pattern by gender in years 
free of mobility limitation (Central ranked the best and the North East ranked 
the worst). Finally, both males and females in the South had the longest life 
expectancy and the most years of life with severe mobility limitation.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies inequalities in years without and with 
mobility limitations with important policy implication.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two distinct 
diseases that share a condition of chronic inflammation of the airways and 
bronchial obstruction. In clinical settings, it is not rare to come across 
patients who present with clinical and functional features of both diseases, 
posing a diagnostic dilemma. The overlap condition has been termed asthma-COPD 
overlap syndrome (ACOS), and mainly occurs in individuals with long-standing 
asthma, especially if they are also current or former smokers. Patients with 
ACOS have poorer health-related quality of life and a higher exacerbation rate 
than subjects with asthma or COPD alone. Whether ACOS is a distinct nosological 
entity with genetic variants or rather a condition of concomitant diseases that 
overlap is still a matter of debate. However, there is no doubt that extended 
life expectancy has increased the prevalence of asthma and COPD in older ages, 
and thus the probability that overlap conditions occur in clinical settings. In 
addition, age-associated changes of the lung create the basis for the two 
entities to converge on the same subject. ACOS patients may benefit from a 
stepwise treatment similar to that of asthma and COPD; however, the proposed 
therapeutic algorithms are only speculative and extrapolated from studies that 
are not representative of the ACOS population. Inhaled corticosteroids are the 
mainstay of therapy, and always in conjunction with long-acting bronchodilators. 
The potential heterogeneity of the overlap syndrome in terms of inflammatory 
features (T helper-1 vs. T helper-2 pathways) may be responsible for the 
different responses to treatments. The interaction between respiratory drugs and 
concomitant diseases should be carefully evaluated. Similarly, the effect of 
non-respiratory drugs, such as aspirin, statins, and β-blockers, on lung 
function needs to be properly assessed.

satisfaction, self-rated health, and subjective life expectancy in survey 
instruments.

PURPOSE: This study examines the effect of question context created by order in 
questionnaires on three subjective well-being measures: life satisfaction, 
self-rated health, and subjective life expectancy.
METHODS: We conducted two Web survey experiments. The first experiment (n = 648) 
altered the order of life satisfaction and self-rated health: (1) life 
satisfaction asked immediately after self-rated health; (2) self-rated health 
immediately after life satisfaction; and (3) two items placed apart. We examined 
their correlation coefficient by experimental condition and further examined its 
interaction with objective health. The second experiment (n = 479) asked life 
expectancy before and after parental mortality questions. Responses to life 
expectancy were compared by order using ANOVA, and we examined interaction with 
parental mortality status using ANCOVA. Additionally, response time and probes 
were examined.
RESULTS: Correlation coefficients between self-rated health and life 
satisfaction differed significantly by order: 0.313 (life satisfaction first), 
0.508 (apart), and 0.643 (self-rated health first). Differences were larger 
among respondents with chronic conditions. Response times were the shortest when 
self-rated health was asked first. When life expectancy asked after parental 
mortality questions, respondents reported considering parents more for answering 
life expectancy; and respondents with deceased parents reported significantly 
lower expectancy, but not those whose parents were alive.
CONCLUSION: Question context effects exist. Findings suggest placing life 
satisfaction and self-rated health apart to avoid artificial attenuation or 
inflation in their association. Asking about parental mortality prior to life 
expectancy appears advantageous as this leads respondents to consider parental 
longevity more, an important factor for true longevity.

PURPOSE: While partial meniscectomy results in a compromised tibiofemoral joint, 
little is known regarding tibiofemoral joint loading during running in 
individuals who are post-partial meniscectomy. It was hypothesized that 
individuals post-partial meniscectomy would run with a greater hip support 
moment, yielding reduced peak knee extension moments and reduced tibiofemoral 
joint contact forces.
METHODS: 3-D Treadmill running mechanics were evaluated in 23 athletic 
individuals post-partial meniscectomy (37.5 ± 19.0 months post-partial 
meniscectomy) and 23 matched controls. Bilateral hip, knee and ankle 
contributions to the total support moment and the peak knee extension moment 
were calculated. A musculoskeletal model estimated peak and impulse tibiofemoral 
joint contact forces. Knee function was quantified with the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
RESULTS: During running, the partial meniscectomy group had a greater hip 
support moment (p = 0.002) and a reduced knee support moment (p < 0.001) 
relative to the total support moment. This movement pattern was associated with 
a 14.5 % reduction (p = 0.019) in the peak knee extension moment. Despite these 
differences, there were no significant group differences in peak or impulse 
tibiofemoral joint contact forces. Lower KOOS Quality of Life scores were 
associated with greater hip support moment (p = 0.004, r = -0.58), reduced knee 
support moment (p = 0.006, r = 0.55) and reduced peak knee extension moment 
(p = 0.01, r = 0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Disordered running mechanics are present long term post-partial 
meniscectomy. A coordination strategy that shifts a proportion of the total 
support moment away from the knee to the hip reduces the peak knee extension 
moment, but does not equate to reduced tibiofemoral joint contact forces during 
running in individuals post-partial meniscectomy.

PURPOSE: To model the financial and survival impact of early HIV infection 
detection versus late and compare results between the UK and Polish setting 
among the newly detected patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Microsoft Excel decision model (SUNRISE) was designed to 
generate a set of outcomes for a defined population. Survival was modelled on 
the COHERE study extrapolated to a 5-year horizon as a constant hazard. Hazard 
rates were specific to age, sex and whether detection was early or late. The 
primary outcomes for each year up to 5 years were: annual costs, numbers of 
infected cases, hospital admissions and surviving cases. Total population was 
observed in UK and Poland. ISPOR Budget Impact Model - Principles of Good 
Practice were utilised in SUNRISE development.
RESULTS: The projected cumulative cost-savings over 5 years in Poland and UK 
were 5,823,479 PLN (£1,109,234) and £21,608,562 respectfully. When including the 
value of life-years saved projected cumulative cost-savings in Poland and UK 
amounted to 8,374,018 PLN (£1,595,051) and £29,834,679 respectively. Savings 
were insensitive to transmission rates, but were sensitive in direct proportion 
to the percentage shift from late to early detection. In UK, savings were in 
higher proportion to Poland, due to much higher overall cost of HIV treatment 
(whether early or late HIV detected patient).
CONCLUSION: Estimated cost savings that could be translated into identification 
of appropriate programmes (providing wider coverage of HIV testing, awareness 
building) that would lead towards higher proportion of early HIV detected 
patients are very sensitive to the cost of HIV test and overall HIV treatment 
cost.

Is there an alternative to quality-adjusted life years for supporting healthcare 
decision making?

INTRODUCTION: Over the years, a number of criticisms have been raised about the 
robustness of the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) indicator and its use in 
cost-utility analyses; however, costs/QALY are still nowadays recommended as 
reference case by several Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies from some 
Commonwealth countries, such as the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) in the UK, claiming that no alternatives exist to allocate 
health care resources.
AREAS COVERED: This review presents a selection of robust alternative 
methodologies that could be used to support HTA decisions more accurately and 
more fairly than using the QALYs, including for determining the level of patient 
access and reimbursement coverage to healthcare interventions. Expert 
commentary: Because of the scientific complexity of the situations raised by 
existing and innovative health technologies and interventions, there is 
currently no single alternative paradigm to propose at this time, but a spectrum 
of additional analytical techniques which could handle various outcomes 
including costs and health consequences, and which are not based on a simple 
multiplicative formula.

Reduced mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling extends lifespan in 
yeast, nematodes, fruit flies and mice, highlighting a physiological pathway 
that could modulate aging in evolutionarily divergent organisms. This signalling 
system is also hypothesized to play a central role in lifespan extension via 
dietary restriction. By collating data from 48 available published studies 
examining lifespan with reduced mTOR signalling, we show that reduced mTOR 
signalling provides similar increases in median lifespan across species, with 
genetic mTOR manipulations consistently providing greater life extension than 
pharmacological treatment with rapamycin. In contrast to the consistency in 
changes in median lifespan, however, the demographic causes for life extension 
are highly species specific. Reduced mTOR signalling extends lifespan in 
nematodes by strongly reducing the degree to which mortality rates increase with 
age (aging rate). By contrast, life extension in mice and yeast occurs largely 
by pushing back the onset of aging, but not altering the shape of the mortality 
curve once aging starts. Importantly, in mice, the altered pattern of mortality 
induced by reduced mTOR signalling is different to that induced by dietary 
restriction, which reduces the rate of aging. Effects of mTOR signalling were 
also sex dependent, but only within mice, and not within flies, thus again 
species specific. An alleviation of age-associated mortality is not a shared 
feature of reduced mTOR signalling across model organisms and does not replicate 
the established age-related survival benefits of dietary restriction.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease 
associated with increasing disability, reduced quality of life and substantial 
costs (as a result of both intervention acquisition and hospitalisation). The 
objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
seven biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) compared with 
each other and conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs). The 
decision problem was divided into those patients who were cDMARD naive and those 
who were cDMARD experienced; whether a patient had severe or moderate to severe 
disease; and whether or not an individual could tolerate methotrexate (MTX).
DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE from 1948 to July 
2013; EMBASE from 1980 to July 2013; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
from 1996 to May 2013; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1898 
to May 2013; Health Technology Assessment Database from 1995 to May 2013; 
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects from 1995 to May 2013; Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from 1982 to April 2013; and 
TOXLINE from 1840 to July 2013. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they 
evaluated the impact of a bDMARD used within licensed indications on an outcome 
of interest compared against an appropriate comparator in one of the stated 
population subgroups within a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Outcomes of 
interest included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores and European 
League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. Interrogation of Early Rheumatoid 
Arthritis Study (ERAS) data was undertaken to assess the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on cDMARDs.
METHODS: Network meta-analyses (NMAs) were undertaken for patients who were 
cDMARD naive and for those who were cDMARD experienced. These were undertaken 
separately for EULAR and ACR data. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to 
explore the impact of including RCTs with a small proportion of bDMARD 
experienced patients and where MTX exposure was deemed insufficient. A 
mathematical model was constructed to simulate the experiences of hypothetical 
patients. The model was based on EULAR response as this is commonly used in 
clinical practice in England. Observational databases, published literature and 
NMA results were used to populate the model. The outcome measure was cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Sixty RCTs met the review inclusion criteria for clinical 
effectiveness, 38 of these trials provided ACR and/or EULAR response data for 
the NMA. Fourteen additional trials contributed data to sensitivity analyses. 
There was uncertainty in the relative effectiveness of the interventions. It was 
not clear whether or not formal ranking of interventions would result in 
clinically meaningful differences. Results from the analysis of ERAS data 
indicated that historical assumptions regarding HAQ progression had been 
pessimistic. The typical incremental cost per QALY of bDMARDs compared with 
cDMARDs alone for those with severe RA is > £40,000. This increases for those 
who cannot tolerate MTX (£50,000) and is > £60,000 per QALY when bDMARDs were 
used prior to cDMARDs. Values for individuals with moderate to severe RA were 
higher than those with severe RA. Results produced using EULAR and ACR data were 
similar. The key parameter that affected the results is the assumed HAQ 
progression while on cDMARDs. When historic assumptions were used typical 
incremental cost per QALY values fell to £38,000 for those with severe disease 
who could tolerate MTX.
CONCLUSIONS: bDMARDs appear to have cost per QALY values greater than the 
thresholds stated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for 
interventions to be cost-effective. Future research priorities include: the 
evaluation of the long-term HAQ trajectory while on cDMARDs; the relationship 
between HAQ direct medical costs; and whether or not bDMARDs could be stopped 
once a patient has achieved a stated target (e.g. remission).
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42012003386.
