were conducted to estimate risks of vascular, cancer, and non-vascular 
non-cancer mortality. Remaining life expectancy at age of diabetes diagnosis was 
estimated using the Chiang II method.
RESULTS: A total of 15,848 individuals (1,132 PPDM, 3,396 T1DM, and 11,320 T2DM) 
were included. The risks of vascular mortality and non-vascular non-cancer 
mortality did not differ significantly between PPDM and T2DM or T1DM. PPDM was 
associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer mortality compared with 
T2DM (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.63) or T1DM 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.13). The risk of 
cancer mortality associated with PPDM (versus T2DM) was significantly higher in 
women than in men (p for interaction = 0.003). This sex difference in cancer 
mortality risk was also significant in the comparison between PPDM and T1DM (p 
for interaction = 0.006). Adults of both sexes with PPDM had the lowest 
remaining life expectancy (in comparison with T2DM or T1DM) up to 64 years of 
age.
CONCLUSIONS: People with PPDM have a higher risk of cancer mortality compared 
with those with T2DM or T1DM. This is especially pronounced in women. Young and 
middle-aged adults with PPDM have a lower life expectancy compared with their 
counterparts with T2DM or T1DM.

PURPOSE: According to estimations of the World Health Organization, depressive 
disorders, and cardiovascular disease will be the leading causes for global 
burden of disease in 2030. The aim of the present study was to estimate the 
value a representative sample of the German population places on 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for depressive disorders compared to heart 
disease.
METHODS: A representative sample of N = 967 of the German general public was 
randomly presented with one of two hypothetical health-loss scenarios: One 
version of the questionnaire presented respondents with health loss due to 
depression, while the other version dealt with health loss due to experiencing a 
heart disease. Respondents were asked to indicate their willingness to pay (WTP) 
for four hypothetical health-gain scenarios with different treatment options.
RESULTS: In the depression questionnaire median WTP values ranged from 1000 to 
1500 EUR; in the heart disease questionnaire from 1000 to 2000 EUR. Results of 
the Mann-Whitney U-Test and Median Test indicate higher WTP values for heart 
disease compared to depressive disorders when QALY gains were minor and 
stretched over a long period of time, and when treatment with bypass operation 
(rather than treatment with ECT) was offered. Zero WTP was significantly higher 
in all scenarios of the depression questionnaire in comparison to the hearth 
disease questionnaire.
CONCLUSION: Results indicate that respondents valued the necessity of paying for 
treatment higher when presented with heart disease compared to depression.

OBJECTIVES: Cost utility analyses compare the costs and health outcome of 
interventions, with a denominator of quality-adjusted life year, a generic 
health utility measure combining both quality and quantity of life. Cost utility 
analyses are difficult to compare when methods are not standardized. It is 
unclear how cost utility analyses are measured/reported in critical care and 
what methodologic challenges cost utility analyses pose in this setting. This 
may lead to differences precluding cost utility analyses comparisons. Therefore, 
we performed a systematic review of cost utility analyses conducted in critical 
care. Our objectives were to understand: 1) methodologic characteristics, 2) how 
health-related quality-of-life was measured/reported, and 3) what costs were 
reported/measured.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched for cost utility analyses in critical 
care in MEDLINE, Embase, American College of Physicians Journal Club, CENTRAL, 
Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews' selected subset of archived versions of UK 
National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Database of Abstracts of 
Reviews of Effects, and American Economic Association electronic databases from 
inception to April 30, 2020.
SETTING: Adult ICUs.
PATIENTS: Adult critically ill patients.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 8,926 citations, 80 cost utility analyse 
studies were eligible. The time horizon most commonly reported was lifetime 
(59%). For health utility reporting, health-related quality-of-life was 
infrequently measured (29% reported), with only 5% of studies reporting baseline 
health-related quality-of-life. Indirect utility measures (generic, 
preference-based health utility measurement tools) were reported in 85% of 
studies (majority Euro-quality-of-life-5 Domains, 52%). Methods of estimating 
health-related quality-of-life were seldom used when the patient was 
incapacitated: imputation (19%), assigning fixed utilities for incapacitation 
(19%), and surrogates reporting on behalf of incapacitated patients (5%). For 
cost utility reporting transparency, separate incremental costs and 
quality-adjusted life years were both reported in only 76% of studies. 
Disaggregated quality-adjusted life years (reporting separate health utility and 
life years) were described in only 34% of studies.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified deficiencies which warrant recommendations 
(standardized measurement/reporting of resource use/unit costs/health-related 
quality-of-life/methodological preferences) for improved design, conduct, and 
reporting of future cost utility analyses in critical care.

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant, 
hereditary polyposis syndrome defined by gastrointestinal hamartomas and 
mucocutaneous pigmentations, caused by a germline mutation in the serine/ 
threonine kinase 11 or liver kinase B1 (STK11/LKB1) genes. Hamartomatous polyps 
located throughout the gastrointestinal tract can be complicated by bleeding and 
small bowel intussusception, potentially leading to the need for emergency 
surgery. Individuals suffering from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome have an increased 
lifetime risk of various forms of cancer (gastrointestinal, pancreatic, lung, 
breast, uterine, ovarian and testicular). Surveillance should lead to the 
prevention of complications and thus a reduction in mortality and morbidity of 
patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: A combined approach based on wireless capsule endoscopy, 
magnetic resonance enterography and device-assisted enteroscopy is effective in 
reduction of the polyp burden and thus decreasing the risk of bleeding and 
intussusception. Current guidelines for screening and surveillance are mostly 
based on expert opinion rather than evidence.
SUMMARY: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an emerging disease that significantly 
affects the quality of life enjoyed by patients. Despite of all the progress in 
improved early diagnostics, options for advanced endoscopic therapy and 
elaborate surveillance, acute and chronic complications decrease the life 
expectancy of patients suffering from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

Over the past 20 years, demographic changes and a longer life expectancy of 
cancer patients has significantly increased the prevalence of this patient group 
in the intensive care unit (ICU). A fundamental finding is that acute organ 
dysfunction, rather than the underlying malignancy, determines the prognosis of 
ICU patients. While hematologic patients often suffer from a more severe disease 
course, patients with solid tumors do not present an increased hospital 
mortality compared to the normal population. As with other indications, the 
decision to transfer a cancer patient to an ICU should be made as soon as 
possible. While early transfer is associated with reduced hospital mortality, 
the presence of multiorgan failure on ICU admission is associated with increased 
mortality. Overall, the intensive care and hospital survival of critically ill 
hematologic or oncologic patients has improved over the last two decades and is 
now as high as 50 to 60%. After surviving an intensive care stay, one fifth of 
all patients have a good long-term prognosis. Thus, the former paradigm of 
general rejection of cancer patients for ICU care is no longer justified. For 
optimal care of cancer patients requiring intensive care, close cooperation 
between hematologists/oncologists and intensive care physicians is essential.

Publisher: Mit dem demographischen Wandel und einer verlängerten Lebenserwartung 
von Krebspatienten ist auch die Prävalenz dieser Patientengruppe auf der 
Intensivstation deutlich gestiegen. Dabei bestimmt vor allem das Auftreten 
akuter Organdysfunktionen und weniger die maligne Grunderkrankung die Prognose. 
Patienten mit soliden Tumoren weisen im Vergleich zur Normalbevölkerung keine 
erhöhte Krankenhausmortalität auf. Hämatologische Patienten hingegen erleiden 
häufig einen schwereren Krankheitsverlauf. Die Entscheidung für eine 
Intensivtherapie sollte möglichst zeitnah getroffen werden, da die frühzeitige 
Intensivverlegung mit einer reduzierten Krankenhausmortalität einhergeht. Das 
Vorliegen eines Multiorganversagens bei Aufnahme auf die Intensivstation ist 
demgegenüber mit einer erhöhten Mortalität vergesellschaftet. Grundsätzlich hat 
sich das Intensiv- und Krankenhausüberleben von kritisch kranken hämatologischen 
oder onkologischen Patienten in den letzten zwei Dekaden stetig verbessert und 
liegt aktuell bei etwa 50-60 %. Einem Fünftel aller Patienten bietet sich nach 
überlebtem Intensivaufenthalt eine gute Langzeitprognose. Unter diesen 
Voraussetzungen ist das ehemals bestehende Paradigma der generellen Ablehnung 
von Krebspatienten für die intensivmedizinische Versorgung heute nicht mehr zu 
vertreten. Damit die Versorgung intensivpflichtiger Krebspatienten optimal 
gelingt, ist eine enge Kooperation von Hämatologen/Onkologen und 
Intensivmedizinern notwendig.

BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common upper-extremity nerve 
compression syndrome. Over 500,000 carpal tunnel release (CTR) procedures are 
performed in the U.S. yearly. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic 
CTR (ECTR) versus open CTR (OCTR) using data from published meta-analyses 
comparing outcomes for ECTR and OCTR.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of OCTR 
versus ECTR for patients undergoing unilateral CTR in an office setting under 
local anesthesia and in an operating-room (OR) setting under monitored 
anesthesia care. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We modeled societal 
(modeled with a 50-year-old patient) and Medicare payer (modeled with a 
65-year-old patient) perspectives, adopting a lifetime time horizon. We 
performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs).
RESULTS: ECTR resulted in 0.00141 additional QALY compared with OCTR. From a 
societal perspective, assuming 8.21 fewer days of work missed after ECTR than 
after OCTR, ECTR cost less across all procedure settings. The results are 
sensitive to the number of days of work missed following surgery. From a payer 
perspective, ECTR in the OR (ECTROR) cost $1,872 more than OCTR in the office 
(OCTRoffice), for an ICER of approximately $1,332,000/QALY. The ECTROR cost $654 
more than the OCTROR, for an ICER of $464,000/QALY. The ECTRoffice cost $107 
more than the OCTRoffice, for an ICER of $76,000/QALY. From a payer perspective, 
for a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, OCTRoffice was preferred 
over ECTROR in 77% of the PSA iterations. From a societal perspective, ECTROR 
was preferred over OCTRoffice in 61% of the PSA iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, ECTR is associated with lower costs as 
a result of an earlier return to work and leads to higher QALYs. Additional 
research on return to work is needed to confirm these findings on the basis of 
contemporary return-to-work practices. From a payer perspective, ECTR is more 
expensive and is cost-effective only if performed in an office setting under 
local anesthesia.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Bilateral congenital dacryocystocoele with 
intranasal extension is very rare and may lead to mild to severe respiratory 
distress, depending on the degree of obstruction, in an otherwise healthy 
newborn. If severe, an urgent surgical intervention may be life saving. Our aim 
is to alert paediatric surgeons to this rare condition. Early detection and 
early treatment with a minimally invasive surgical procedure may be life saving 
and prevent severe sequelae due to respiratory distress.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a healthy newborn girl who was admitted to 
neonatal intensive care with progressive respiratory distress. After a full 
work-up, she was diagnosed with bilateral dacryocystocoele with intranasal 
extension and complete obstruction of the anterior nasal cavity. Emergency 
bilateral endoscopic marsupialization of the cysts with probing of the 
nasolacrimal duct was performed. The girl recovered without sequelae.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: In congenital dacryocystocoele, coexistent obstruction of 
the valve of Rosenmüller and the valve of Hasner is observed. Subsequent 
intranasal protrusion with obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity may occur. 
The incidence is unknown, but if bilateral, it is very rare. In most cases, a 
dacryocystocoele is uncomplicated and may be treated conservatively. However, if 
intranasal protrusion occurs, and especially if the involvement is bilateral, it 
is a surgical emergency.
CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis with subsequent minimally invasive surgical 
treatment of bilateral congenital dacryocystocoele with intranasal protrusion 
may prevent serious complications due to respiratory distress.

Background and Summary: Thanks to increasing cure rates to currently >80%, 
children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) survive their cancer much more 
frequently today than decades ago. Due to their long life expectancy, CAYA 
cancer survivors are at a particular risk of long-term sequelae from the cancer 
itself or the therapy applied; this requires specific follow-up, and 
preventative or even therapeutic interventions. Thus, compared to the normal 
population, morbidity and mortality may be significantly increased. In 2 of 3 
survivors, the cancer and the respective treatment can lead to late effects, 
even after 30 years, which require specific therapy; in about one-third of these 
cases, these effects are classed as severe. Applying structured follow-up could 
identify these late effects at an early stage and initiate immediate treatment. 
In 2018, a working group dealing with long-term survival after cancer detected 
<40 years of age was founded within the framework of the National Cancer Plan of 
the German Federal Ministry of Health.

[Management of Cystic Lesions of the Pancreas].

[Article in German]

Anz D, Seidensticker M, Mayerle J.

Cystic pancreatic lesions are a frequent incidental finding on ultrasound or 
cross sectional imaging. The incidence of pancreatic lesions experience a steady 
climb in recent years due to an increased number of cross sectional imaging and 
an increasing life expectancy. The clinical challenge is to identify individuals 
bearing lesions with potentially malignant or pre-malignant features. Indeed, by 
far most cystic pancreatic lesions are not associated with an increased risk for 
the development of cancer. Taking into account the increasing incidence rates of 
cystic pancreatic lesions a rational and economic use of diagnostics is 
warranted. This review provides an overview on the different types of cystic 
lesions, the appropriate use of diagnostics and a clinical management algorithm 
balancing intervention and surveillance.

Telomerase is regarded as a crucial biomarker for the early diagnosis of 
malignant tumors and a valuable therapeutic target. In this work, a 
telomerase-triggered amplification strategy was designed on the basis of a 
catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) for bridging a signal probe of platinum 
nanoparticles (Pt NPs) anchored on three-dimensional (3D) epoxy-functionalized 
macroporous carbon (Pt/MPC-COOH) in an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor. 
Pt/MPC-COOH nanomaterials with interconnected macroporous structure not only 
immobilized hairpin DNA probe 2 (H2) via an amide reaction (Pt/MPC-COOH-H2), but 
they also generated an obvious electrochemical signal in response to 
acetaminophen (AP) oxidation. After the introduction of telomerase, telomerase 
primer (TP) was extended to a telomerase extension product (TEP) with several 
hexamer repeats (TTAGGG)n to initiate the CHA cycle, leading to signal 
amplification. Subsequently, with the TEP-triggered CHA cycle amplification 
strategy, a large amount of Pt/MPC-COOH-H2 was introduced on the electrode 
surface for the construction of the electrochemical platform, which realized the 
sensitive detection of telomerase activity from 102 to107 cells mL-1 with a 
limit of detection (LOD) of 9.02 cells mL-1. This strategy provides a sensitive 
method for the detection of biomolecules that could be useful for bioanalysis 
and early clinical diagnoses of diseases.

Republic.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening in high-risk population increases the 
proportion of patients diagnosed at a resectable stage.
AIMS: To optimize the selection criteria and quality indicators for lung cancer 
screening by low-dose CT (LDCT) in the Czech population of high-risk 
individuals. To compare the influence of screening on the stage of lung cancer 
at the time of the diagnosis with the stage distribution in an unscreened 
population. To estimate the impact on life-years lost according to the 
stage-specific cancer survival and stage distribution in the screened 
population. To calculate the cost-effectiveness of the screening program.
METHODS: Based on the evidence from large national trials - the National Lung 
Screening Trial in the USA (NLST), the NELSON study, the recent recommendations 
of the Fleischner society, the American College of Radiology, and I-ELCAP action 
group, we developed a protocol for a single-arm prospective study in the Czech 
Republic for the screening of high-risk asymptomatic individuals. The study 
commenced in August 2020.
RESULTS: The inclusion criteria are: age 55 to 74 years; smoking: ≥30 
pack-years; smoker or ex-smoker <15 years; performance status (0-1). The 
screening timepoints are at baseline and 1 year. The LDCT acquisition has a 
target CTDIvol ≤0.5mGy and effective dose ≤0.2mSv for a standard-size patient. 
The interpretation of findings is primarily based on nodule volumetry, volume 
doubling time (and related risk of malignancy). The management includes 
follow-up LDCT, contrast enhanced CT, PET/CT, tissue sampling. The primary 
outcome is the number of cancers detected at a resectable stage, secondary 
outcomes include the average cost per diagnosis of lung cancer, the number, 
cost, complications of secondary examinations, and the number of potentially 
important secondary findings.
CONCLUSIONS: A study protocol for early detection of lung cancer in Czech 
high-risk asymptomatic individuals (ELEGANCE) study using LDCT has been 
described.

When Scarcity Meets Disparity: "Resources Allocation and COVID-19 Patients with 
Diabetes".

Appel JM(1).

The COVID-19 pandemic raised distinct challenges in the field of scarce resource 
allocation, a long-standing area of inquiry in the field of bioethics. 
Policymakers and states developed crisis guidelines for ventilator triage that 
incorporated such factors as immediate prognosis, long-term life expectancy, and 
current stage of life. Often these depend upon existing risk factors for severe 
illness, including diabetes. However, these algorithms generally failed to 
account for the underlying structural biases, including systematic racism and 
economic disparity, that rendered some patients more vulnerable to these 
conditions. This paper discusses this unique ethical challenge in resource 
allocation through the lens of care for patients with severe COVID-19 and 
diabetes.

Dexmedetomidine for hyperactive delirium at the end of life: An open-label 
single arm pilot study with dose escalation in adult patients admitted to an 
inpatient palliative care unit.

BACKGROUND: Terminal delirium, specifically the hyperactive delirium subtype at 
the end of life, is common in palliative care patients. Standard care often 
involves sedation to alleviate distress. The alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist 
dexmedetomidine may have promise in terminal delirium, due to its properties of 
decreasing delirium and permitting rousable sedation.
AIM: This study aimed to describe the effect of dexmedetomidine on delirium and 
sedation, when delivered via continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) in patients 
with terminal delirium.
DESIGN: The trial was prospectively registered in the ANZCTR database 
(ACTRN12618000658213) and conducted in accordance with CONSORT (pilot study 
extension). Twenty-two adult patients were treated with a CSCI of 
dexmedetomidine with a two-tier dose schedule, low and high dose. Delirium 
severity was measured by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS, target 
<13), and sedation by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, Palliative Version 
(RASS-PAL, target -1 to -3).
RESULTS: All patients had a response to dexmedetomidine as measured by decrease 
in MDAS after initiation; 59% required escalation to high dose to maintain 
control of delirium. All responses to high dose were sustained. RASS-PAL scores 
showed significant variability, however mean scores remained within target range 
on both doses, and the majority of patients were rousable. Fifty percent of 
patients treated crossed over to standard care; no patients who crossed over 
were experiencing moderate-severe delirium. Predominant reason for crossover was 
family request for deeper sedation.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine shows potential for the management of terminal 
delirium with improved interactivity. Further research is needed to determine 
efficacy compared to current standard care.

Background: The opioid epidemic continues to generate a significant mental and 
physical health burden on patients, and claims the life of almost 150 Americans 
daily. Making matters worse, an increase in relapses and/or opioid-related 
deaths has been reported in more than 40 U.S. states since the start of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is one of the single most expensive 
disorders in the United States, generating average medical costs of $60B from 
just 2 million Americans diagnosed with the disorder. In commercial use since 
2019, reSET-O is a non-drug, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) that 
delivers evidence-based neurobehavioral treatment for OUD and helps overcome the 
barriers associated with access to care, stigma, and social distancing. Although 
shown to be cost effective and efficacious in clinical trials and real-world 
evidence studies, respectively, information on its value for money from a health 
utilities and cost per quality-adjusted life-year is needed to inform policy 
discussions.Objectives: To evaluate the impact of reSET-O on health utilities 
and assess its overall cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained vs. 
treatment-as-usual (TAU).Methods: Decision analytic model comparing reSET-O plus 
TAU to TAU alone (i.e. buprenorphine, face-to-face counseling, and contingency 
management) over 12 weeks. Clinical effectiveness data (abstinence and health 
utility) were obtained from a clinical trial, and resource utilization and cost 
data were adapted from a recent claims data analysis to reflect less frequent 
face-to-face counseling with the therapeutic.Results: The addition of reSET-O to 
TAU decreases total health care costs by -$131 and resulted in post-treatment 
utility values within population norms, with a corresponding gain of 0.003 
QALYs. reSET-O when used adjunctively to TAU was economically dominant (less 
costly, more effective) vs. TAU alone.Conclusion: reSET-O is an 
economically-dominant adjunctive treatment for OUD and is associated with an 
overall reduction in total incremental cost vs TAU.

Objectives: To determine whether olaparib maintenance therapy, used with and 
without restriction by BRCA1/2 mutation status, is cost-effective at the 
population level for platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer in 
Singapore.Methods: A partitioned survival model compared three management 
strategies: 1) treat all patients with olaparib; 2) test for germline BRCA1/2 
mutation, followed by targeted olaparib use in mutation carriers only; 3) 
observe all patients. Mature overall survival (OS) data from Study 19 and a 
15-year time horizon were used and direct medical costs were applied. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties.Results: Treating 
all patients with olaparib was the most costly and effective strategy, followed 
by targeted olaparib use, and observation of all patients. Base-case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for all-olaparib and targeted use strategies 
were SGD133,394 (USD100,926) and SGD115,736 (USD87,566) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained, respectively, compared to observation. ICERs were most 
sensitive to the cost of olaparib, time horizon and discount rate for outcomes. 
When these parameters were varied, ICERs remained above SGD92,000 
(USD69,607)/QALY.Conclusions: At the current price, olaparib is not 
cost-effective when used with or without restriction by BRCA1/2 mutation status 
in Singapore, despite taking into account potential OS improvement over a long 
time horizon.

BACKGROUND: Patients with systemic lupus erythematous have a significantly 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is not fully explained by 
traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Despite increasing life 
expectancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematous, mortality due to 
cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death in these patients, has not 
changed. Children with lupus suffer from more aggressive disease compared to 
their adult counterparts, and there is a growing concern for their increased 
risk of cardiovascular disease as they age. BODY: There is an unmet need for 
therapies to address the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in 
childhood-onset lupus. Colchicine has many anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular 
protective properties, including inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 activity, key 
proinflammatory cytokines that are predictive of future adverse cardiovascular 
events. In the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT), colchicine was 
recently found to have significant benefit with minimal risk in adults with 
previous myocardial infarction for prevention of secondary vascular disease. 
While adult studies are promising, no studies have been conducted in pediatric 
patients to investigate colchicine's potential for cardiovascular protection in 
children and adolescents with lupus.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating colchicine's potential role for 
cardiovascular protection are needed in pediatric patients with systemic lupus 
erythematous.

Over the last decades, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important molecules 
associated with the regulation of gene expression in humans and other organisms, 
expanding the strategies available to diagnose and handle several diseases. This 
paper presents a systematic review of literature of miRNAs related to cancer 
development and explores the main techniques used to quantify these molecules 
and their limitations as screening strategy. The bibliographic research was 
conducted using the online databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, 
and Science Direct searching the terms "microRNA detection", "miRNA detection", 
"miRNA and prostate cancer", "miRNA and cervical cancer", "miRNA and cervix 
cancer", "miRNA and breast cancer", and "miRNA and early cancer diagnosis". 
Along the systematic review over 26,000 published papers were reported, and 252 
papers were returned after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which 
were considered during this review. The aim of this study is to identify 
potential miRNAs related to cancer development that may be useful for early 
cancer diagnosis, notably in the breast, prostate, and cervical cancers. In 
addition, we suggest a preliminary top 20 miRNA panel according to their 
relevance during the respective cancer development. Considering the progressive 
number of new cancer cases every year worldwide, the development of new 
diagnostic tools is critical to refine the accuracy of screening tests, 
improving the life expectancy and allowing a better prognosis for the affected 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Achieving negative status of distal ureteral margin at the time of 
radical cystectomy (RC), and its therapeutic benefit, remains controversial. The 
aim of this review was to evaluate frequency, reliability and impact of positive 
distal ureteral margin after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer on upper 
tract recurrence, cancer specific and overall survival, and to identify best 
candidates for intraoperative frozen section analyses.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systemic review was performed following the PRISMA 
guideline. PubMed/Medline (with following terms; bladder cancer or cystectomy 
and frozen section or ureteral margin), and Cochrane Library were searched up to 
April 2020, to identify all papers evaluating distal ureteral margin and 
discussing clinical interest. Previous reviews and single case reports were 
excluded.
RESULTS: In total, thirty-two relevant studies were identified. Mean rate of 
positive ureteral frozen section after RC was close to 10% [1.1-25.4%]. Frozen 
section (FS) achieved a very good specificity [83-100%] and reserved sensibility 
[45-100%]. In many cases, an initial positive margin on FS can be converted to 
negative. Positive FS and/or PS (permanent section) were associated with upper 
urinary tract recurrence (UUTR). Conversion from positive FS to negative PS was 
associated with low UUTR frequency and better cancer survival in large 
retrospective studies. The relevant prognostic factor associated with positive 
FS and/or PS was CIS within the bladder.
CONCLUSION: FS should be recommended for patients with CIS within the bladder. 
Achieving negative FS/PS might be associated with lower rates of UUTR and better 
survival, for patients with higher life expectancy. Prospective randomized 
controlled studies need to be performed to provide definitive recommendations in 
this area.

Dabie bandavirus (severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV]) 
induces an immunopathogenic disease with a high fatality rate; however, the 
mechanisms underlying its clinical manifestations are largely unknown. In this 
study, we applied targeted proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics to examine 
the differential immune landscape in SFTS patient blood. Serum immunoprofiling 
identified low-risk and high-risk clusters of SFTS patients based on 
inflammatory cytokine levels, which corresponded to disease severity. 
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of SFTS patient peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) at different infection stages showed pronounced expansion of B 
cells with alterations in B-cell subsets in fatal cases. Furthermore, plasma 
cells in which the interferon (IFN) pathway is downregulated were identified as 
the primary reservoir of SFTSV replication. This study identified not only the 
molecular signatures of serum inflammatory cytokines and B-cell lineage 
populations in SFTSV-induced fatalities but also plasma cells as the viral 
reservoir. Thus, this suggests that altered B-cell function is linked to 
lethality in SFTSV infections.IMPORTANCE SFTSV is an emerging virus discovered 
in China in 2009; it has since spread to other countries in East Asia. Although 
the fatality rates of SFTSV infection range from 5.3% to as high as 27%, the 
mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations are largely unknown. In this 
study, we demonstrated that SFTSV infection in fatal cases caused an excessive 
inflammatory response through high induction of proinflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines and the aberrant inactivation of adaptive immune responses. 
Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of SFTS 
patient PBMCs revealed that SFTSV targets the B-cell lineage population, 
especially plasma cells, as the potential viral reservoir in patients for whom 
the infection is fatal. Thus, SFTSV infection may inhibit high-affinity antibody 
maturation and secretion of plasma B cells, suppressing neutralizing antibody 
production and thereby allowing significant virus replication and subsequent 
fatality.
