Eighty-seven individuals reporting a childhood heart problem were identified 
from the PSID and were used to generate the synthetic cohort simulated in the 
model. Life expectancy, disability-free, quality-adjusted, and discounted 
quality-adjusted life years were an average 4.6, 6.7, 5.3, and 1.4 years lower 
than in healthy adults. Lung disease, cancer, and severe mental distress were 
more common compared to healthy individuals. The CHD cohort earned $237,800 less 
in lifetime earnings and incurred higher average total medical spend by $66,600 
compared to healthy individuals. Compared to healthy adults, the total burden of 
CHD is over $500K per adult. Despite being among the healthiest adults with CHD, 
there are significant decrements in life expectancy, employment, and lifetime 
earnings, with concomitant increases in medical spend.

Musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) are the leading cause of disability and facing 
them demands updated reports on their burden for efficient policymaking. We 
showed Iran had the highest female-to-male ratio and highest increase in the 
burden of musculoskeletal diseases, in the past three decades, worldwide. We 
further confirmed the role of population aging as the main cause.
PURPOSE: MSDs comprise most of the top causes of years lived with disability 
(YLDs) worldwide and are rapidly increasing in lower- and middle-income 
countries. Here, we present disability and mortality due to MSDs in Iran at the 
national level from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We used Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Study data and standard 
methodology and presented the burden of MSDs in rates of years of life lost 
(YLLs), YLDs, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) during 1990-2017, for 
population aged ≥ 5 years old. We further explored attributable risk factors and 
decomposed the changing trend in DALYs to assess underlying causes.
RESULTS: In Iran, MSDs were responsible for 1.82 million (95%uncertainty 
interval [UI] 1.3-2.4) DALYs, in 2017. During the past 28 years, with 1.75% 
annualized percentage change (APC), Iran had the highest percentage increase in 
the all-ages MSD DALYs rate worldwide, while the age-standardized DALYs APC was 
negligible. Low back pain was the greatest contributor to DALYs and caused 4.5% 
of total DALYs. The female population is experiencing considerably higher burden 
of MSDs, with 115% and 48% higher all-ages YLLs and YLDs rates per 100,000, 
respectively (YLLs 28.7; YLDs 2629.1), than males (YLLs 13.2; YLDs 1766.1). 
However, due to wide UIs, difference was not significant. Only 17.6% of MSD YLDs 
are attributable to assessed risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Despite that MSDs are rising as an important cause of disability in 
Iran, these conditions are not sufficiently addressed in health policies. There 
is urgent need for cross-sectoral engagement, especially addressing the MSDs in 
females.

PURPOSE: As patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly 
integrated into clinical practice, there is a need to translate collected data 
into valuable information to guide and improve the quality and value of patient 
care. The purpose of this study was to investigate health-related 
quality-of-life (QoL) trajectories in the 5 years following total knee 
replacement (TKR) and the patient characteristics associated with these 
trajectories. The feasibility of translating QoL trajectories into valuable 
information for guiding patient-centered care was also explored.
METHODS: Data on patients who underwent TKR between 2006 and 2011 from a 
single-institution registry were extracted including patient-reported QoL 
(captured using the Short Form Survey (SF-12) instrument) up to 5 years 
post-surgery. QoL trajectories were modelled using latent class growth analysis. 
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated to illustrate longer term 
health benefit. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to 
examine the association between trajectory groups and baseline patient 
characteristics.
RESULTS: After exclusions, 1553 patients out of 1892 were included in the 
analysis. Six unique QoL trajectories were identified; with differing levels at 
baseline and improvement patterns post-surgery. Only 18.4% of patients were 
identified to be in the most positive QoL trajectory (low baseline, large 
sustainable improvement after surgery) associated with the greatest gain in 
QALY. These patients were likely to be younger, have no co-morbidities and 
report greater pain at pre-surgery than most in other QoL trajectories.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the importance of underlying heterogeneity 
in QoL trajectories, resulting in variable QALY gains. There is scope in 
translating routinely collected PROMs to improve shared decision-making allowing 
for more patient engagement. However, further research is required to identify 
suitable approaches of its implementation into practice to guide clinical care 
and maximize patient outcomes.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a highly prevalent autosomal recessive disorder that is 
caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene 
(7q31.2), which encodes the CFTR chloride-anion channel that is expressed in 
several tissues. Life expectancy has increased significantly over the past few 
decades due to therapeutic advances and early diagnosis through neonatal 
screening. However, new complications have been identified, including CF-related 
diabetes (CFRD). The earliest detectable glycemic abnormality is postprandial 
hyperglycemia that progresses into fasting hyperglycemia. CFRD is associated 
with a decline in lung function, impairments in weight gain and growth, pubertal 
development, and increased morbidity and mortality. Annual screening with oral 
glucose tolerance test is recommended beginning at the age of 10, and screenings 
are recommended for any age group during the first 48 h of hospital admission. 
Fasting plasma glucose levels ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or 2-h postprandial plasma 
glucose levels ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) that persist for more than 48 h are 
diagnostic criteria for CFRD. Under stable health condition, the diagnosis is 
made when laboratory abnormalities in accordance with the American Diabetes 
Association criteria are detected for the first time; however, levels of HbA1c 
<6.5% do not rule out the diagnosis. Treatment for CFRD includes insulin 
replacement and a hypercaloric and hyperproteic diet that does not restrict 
carbohydrates, fats or salt, and diabetes self-management education. The most 
important CFRD complications are nutritional and pulmonary disease 
deterioration, though the microvascular complications of diabetes have already 
been described.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a major chronic condition with ever-increasing health 
and economic burden. This study aimed to measure the impact of diabetes on total 
life expectancy (TLE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) at ages 70 and 80 and to 
assess how educational level, obesity, and comorbidity affected the 
expectancies.
METHODS: The study involved 9849 population-representative women born between 
1921 and 1926 from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). 
Self-rated health was obtained from the ALSWH surveys. Diabetes diagnosis was 
ascertained using survey and health care administrative data. Total life 
expectancy and HLE were estimated for women with and without diabetes using 
multistate modeling.
RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of poor health (adjusted 
risk ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.49-1.79). Diabetes was also 
associated with a reduction of 0.9 years in HLE and 2.6 years in TLE at age 70 
and 0.4 years in HLE and 1.3 years in TLE at age 80. If a woman had low 
education, obesity, and more than 2 comorbidities in addition to diabetes, these 
reductions increased to 3.0 years in TLE and 7.9 years in HLE at age 70 and 1.5 
years in TLE and 3.8 years in HLE at age 80.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes substantially reduced older women's quantity and quality 
of life, with further reductions for those with lower education, obesity, and 
comorbidities. These findings underscore the importance of optimally managing 
diabetes by maintaining a healthy weight and delaying the onset of 
comorbidities, to promote healthy aging for older women with diabetes.

Reproductive stage is very sensitive to various forms of environmental stresses 
such as drought stress. The proteomic analysis of anther during pollen 
development in response to drought stress was performed using a label-free 
quantitative shotgun proteomic technique to define the underlying molecular 
principles in two contrasting wheat genotypes Shiraz (susceptible) and D-10 
(tolerant). Drought stress resulted in around two-fold decline in seed setting 
capacity and pollen viability in the Shiraz genotype compared to D-10. A Partial 
Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) of proteomic data revealed the 
abundance of 131 differentially abundant proteins significantly contributing in 
separation of drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes under normal and stress 
conditions. Proteins involved in cellular respiration, carbohydrate metabolism, 
RNA metabolism, and vesicle trafficking showed completely different responses in 
two genotypes. These proteins may maintain hexose pool and energy level and 
control regulation of transcription and transport. Furthermore, different 
members of functional groups such as protein biosynthesis and degradation, 
chromatin organization, and cytoskeleton dynamics were differentially abundant 
in response to stress in both genotypes which suggest their function in both 
genotypes to maintain minimum pollen viability/ fertility under drought stress. 
In conclusion, our findings revealed various metabolic and regulatory pathways 
underlying survival strategies required for pollen fertility and viability. 
SIGNIFICANCE: Drought caused by global climate change decreases cereal grain 
productivity worldwide. Yield losses due to water stress have been reported for 
major small grain cereal including wheat. Our findings highlighted the 
importance of key proteins in wheat adaptation to drought stress at reproductive 
stage. The obtained data showed that differentially abundant proteins in drought 
tolerant wheat genotype was remarkably associated with cellular respiration, 
carbohydrate metabolism, RNA metabolism, and vesicle trafficking. These results 
revealed fundamental data to elucidate the complexity of pollen fertility and 
viability under drought stress condition in wheat.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of a brain tumor may increase life expectancy. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accompanied by several segmentation algorithms 
is preferred as a reliable method for assessment. The availability of 
high-dimensional medical image data during diagnosis places a heavy 
computational burden and a suitable pre-processing step is required for lower- 
dimensional representation. The storage requirement and complexity of image data 
are also a concern. To address this concern, the random projection technique 
(RPT) is widely used as a multivariate approach for data reduction.
AIM: This study mainly focuses on T1-weighted MRI image clustering for brain 
tumor segmentation with dimension reduction by using the conventional principal 
component analysis (PCA) and RPT.
METHODS: Two clustering algorithms, K-means and fuzzy c-means (FCM) were used 
for brain tumor detection. The primary study objective was to present a 
comparison of the two clustering methods between MRI images subjected to PCA and 
RPT. In addition to the original dimension of 512 × 512, three other image 
sizes, 256 × 256, 128 × 128, and 64 × 64, were used to determine the effect of 
the methods.
RESULTS: In terms of average reconstruction, Euclidean distance, and 
segmentation distance errors, the RPT produced better results than the PCA 
method for all the clustered images from clustering techniques.
CONCLUSION: According to the values of performance metrics, RPT supported fuzzy 
c-means in achieving the best clustering performance and provided significant 
results for each new size of the MRI images.

BACKGROUND: Cumulative mortality rate and cumulative mortality risk are two 
commonly used indicators to measure the impact and severity of diseases. 
However, they are calculated during a defined life span and assume the subject 
does not die from other causes. This study aims to use a new indicator, lifetime 
death probability (LDP), to estimate the lifetime death probabilities for the 
top five leading causes of death in China and explore the regional differences 
and trends over time.
METHODS: LDPs were calculated using a probability additive formula and abridged 
life tables.
RESULTS: In 2014, LDPs for heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignancy, 
respiratory disease, and injury and poisoning were 24.4, 23.7, 19.2, 15.5, and 
5.3%, respectively. The LDPs for heart disease and malignancy increased by 7.3 
and 0.5%, respectively, compared to those from 2004 to 2005. In contrast, the 
LDPs for cerebrovascular and respiratory disease decreased by 1.0 and 3.9%, 
respectively, compared to those in 2004-2005. Across the eastern, central and 
western regions, malignancy had the highest LDP in the eastern region, 
cerebrovascular and heart diseases in the central region, and respiratory 
diseases, and injury and poisoning in the western region.
CONCLUSIONS: LDP is an effective indicator for comparing health outcomes and can 
be applied for future disease surveillance. Heart disease and malignancy were 
the two most common causes of death in China, but with regional differences. 
There is a need to implement targeted measures to prevent chronic diseases in 
different regions.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost utility of regorafenib and 
trifluridine/tipiracil (T/T) compared with that of best supportive care (BSC) in 
the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated 
with, or not considered candidates for, available therapies, including 
fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapies; 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents; and anti-epidermal growth factor 
receptor agents, in Japan.
METHODS: Efficacy data, utility values, and costs were extracted from published 
studies. The cost and effectiveness of regorafenib and of T/T were compared with 
those of BSC and examined between the 2 agents over a 5-year time horizon using 
a partitioned survival analysis. The health outcomes were life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The costs were year-2018 revisions 
to the drug prices and medical fees. The uncertainty and robustness of the model 
were verified by 1-way sensitivity analysis, probability sensitivity analysis, 
and scenario analysis compared with different clinical studies. A 2% per-annum 
discount was applied to expenses and QALYs. The willingness-to-pay threshold 
used was 5 million Japanese yen (JPY).
FINDINGS: Regorafenib and T/T had incremental costs of 11,898,982 JPY (107,781 
US dollars [USD]) and 5,000,141 JPY (45,291 USD), incremental effects of 0.249 
QALYs (0.280 LYs) and 0.344 QALYs (0.421 LYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of 47,773,791 JPY (432,734 USD) and 14,550,577 JPY 
(131,799 USD) per QALY, respectively. Results of sensitivity analyses all 
exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of 15 million JPY. In the comparison 
of the 2 agents, T/T was a dominant alternative over regorafenib.
IMPLICATIONS: As a third-line or later treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
in Japan, T/T is cost-effective compared with BSC, whereas regorafenib is not. 
It is necessary to adjust the price of regorafenib based on the results of this 
analysis, with the improvement of clinical parameters such as survival time and 
adverse events.

Grape pomace is a high quality biodegradable residue of the winery industry. It 
is comprised of grape seed, skin and stalks, and is blessed with substantial 
quantities of phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins with high antioxidant 
potential. Currently, there is huge emphasis on the isolation of bioactive 
molecules of grape pomace using green technologies such as microwave, 
ultrasound, supercritical fluids, high voltage discharge, enzymatic methods and 
other hybrid techniques. The major applications of these bioactives are 
contemplatedas nutraceuticals and extension in shelf-life of perishable 
foodstuffs. Alternatively, the crude form of grape pomace residues can be used 
for the production of energy, biofertilizers, biochar, biopolymers, composites, 
feed for ruminants and also, mushroom cultivation through microbial processing. 
This review discusses value-addition to grape pomace through biotechnological 
interventions and green processing, providing state-of-art knowledge on current 
scenario and opportunities for sustainability.

BACKGROUND: Rapid deceleration against a seat belt during a motor vehicle 
collision (MVC) may result in an abdominal seat belt sign (ASBS), which is 
associated with a higher risk of hollow viscus injury (HVI). After a negative 
abdominal CT scan, management of patients with ASBS is variable, but recent 
evidence suggests emergency department (ED) discharge may be safe. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that discharge from the ED is cost-effective compared with 23-h 
observation or hospital admission for patients with ASBS and a negative CT.
METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed for an evaluable patient with ASBS 
and negative CT scan using TreeAge software. ED discharge was compared with 23-h 
observation and admission. Analysis was from a health care-based third-party 
payer perspective. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were based on 3-y 
expected outcomes. Probability and costs were estimated from published 
literature and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.
RESULTS: In our base case, ED discharge was the most cost-effective strategy, 
yielding a cost of $706 with 2.86 QALYs. The average costs of 23-h observation 
and hospital admission were $2600 and $8,827, respectively, with 2.87 QALYs 
gained each. The strategy of ED observation becomes cost-effective when the rate 
of HVI after ED discharge exceeds 2.3%. In a Monte Carlo simulation, ED 
discharge was the optimal strategy in 91% of 1000 trials of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: ED discharge is a cost-effective strategy for evaluable patients 
with ASBS and a negative abdominal CT and remains so when the risk of HVI after 
ED discharge is higher than currently assumed.

OBJECTIVE: Radium-223 (223Ra) has been approved for treatment in patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostatic cancer (mCRPC) and bone metastasis. 
This α-emitting radionuclide has a beneficial effect on pain and is also capable 
to increase overall survival (OS). Several studies evaluated the prognostic 
value of different biomarkers at baseline, such as serum values, imaging 
parameters or pain. To date, however, clinicians lack a validated and simple 
system to assess which patients will most likely benefit from 223Ra treatment. 
The 3-variable prognostic score (3-PS), proposed in a single-center study in 
2017 classifies patients in five prognostic groups with a specific OS. This 
study aims to validate the 3-PS in a larger multicenter population.
METHODS: Four hundred and thirty mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra from six 
different centers were analyzed. The 3-PS score consists of the collection of 
baseline hemoglobin, prostatic specific antigen and Eastern cooperative oncology 
group performance status and was initially applied to the whole population 
(total group). The score was then validated on the 338 patient's subgroup (clean 
group) obtained by subtracting the 92 patients enrolled for the original study 
of the 3-PS score. This purified group served as further validation evidence.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that the 3-PS score was valid on the total 
group as well as in the clean group as the AUC estimated (0.74) falls within the 
CI of the AUC calculated on the validation sample (95% CI 0.66-0.82).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the validity of the 3-PS score for mCRPC 
patients. This score is simple, noninvasive and affordable and can be easily 
used to select patients that will most probably complete 223Ra treatment. In 
addition, this tool provides an exact estimate of life expectancy in terms of 
OS.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess nurses' knowledge, perceived 
self-efficacy, and intended behaviors relative to integrating the social 
determinants of health (SDoH) into clinical practice.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was completed with 768 nurses 
working in three hospitals within a large regional healthcare system located in 
the Midwest. Data were collected using an adapted 71-item SDoH Survey, which 
measured nurses' confidence in and frequency of discussing the SDoH with 
patients, general knowledge of the SDoH, familiarity with patients' social and 
economic conditions, and awareness of their institution's health equity 
strategic plan to achieve health equity. The institution's health equity 
strategic plan reflects the organization's commitment to improving the health of 
individuals and neighborhoods by addressing the SDoH known to influence health 
status and life expectancy. Finally, participants were asked to describe 
barriers to incorporating the SDoH into practice along with completing five 
demographic items. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the findings.
FINDINGS: Of the 768 respondents, 63% had a baccalaureate degree in nursing and 
33.1% reported more than 20 years in nursing. Fifty percent of respondents 
reported feeling more knowledgeable or confident in their ability to discuss 
access to care issues with patients compared to the other SDoH. Identified 
barriers to discussing the SDoH included insufficient time to address identified 
needs and unfamiliarity with internal and external resources. Respondents 
stressed the need for interdisciplinary education and collaboration along with 
more information on the role of social workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are more confident in discussing certain determinants of 
health and could benefit from more skill development in discussing SDoH issues 
and stronger collaborative partnerships to address identified needs.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings from the study have implications for supporting the 
educational and resource needs of front-line nurses employed in hospitals and 
health systems seeking to address broader societal issues influencing the health 
status and outcomes of patients and communities.

Active malignancy is an absolute contraindication to kidney transplantation. As 
for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a Philadelphia chromosome-positive 
myeloproliferative neoplasm, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has 
transformed CML from a lethal into a manageable chronic disease with a 
close-to-normal life expectancy. To date it is unknown whether kidney 
transplantation can be safely performed in patients with pre-existing CML. We 
describe the clinical course of a 57-year-old male patient with chronic kidney 
disease caused by reflux nephropathy. This patient had undergone first kidney 
transplantation 20 years earlier and had again been on chronic hemodialysis for 
6 years when CML was diagnosed. First-line therapy with 400 mg imatinib daily 
was well tolerated and induced an optimal cytogenetic and molecular response 
3 months after initiation. One and a half years after CML diagnosis, a second 
kidney transplantation from a deceased donor was performed. Immunosuppression 
included basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. 
Currently, 2 years posttransplant, renal allograft function is stable (serum 
creatinine 1.09 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate 75 mL/min per 
1.73 m2 ), and CML remains in deep molecular remission with imatinib. 
Imatinib-treated CML in deep molecular remission could be regarded as inactive 
malignancy and may therefore not be viewed as an absolute contraindication to 
kidney transplantation.

INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of 
stroke, morbidity and overall mortality. So far, oral anticoagulation (OAC) is 
the standard of care for stroke prevention, either with vitamin K antagonists or 
with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The left atrial appendage (LAA) 
can be eliminated by epicardial or endocardial exclusion. Left atrial appendage 
closure (LAAC) represents a mechanical thromboprophylaxis - which has also been 
termed mechanical vaccination - against stroke, bleeding and death.
AREAS COVERED: Studies show that LAAC provides stroke prevention comparable to 
(N)OAC. Additionally, a notable reduction of bleeding events and its associated 
mortality is achieved by LAAC. With accruing experience and advances in patient 
selection, procedural planning, implantation techniques and devices, 
contemporary LAAC registries report high rates of success and low rates of 
complications.
EXPERT OPINION: The decision to provide the most appropriate stroke prevention 
for patients with AF (OAC, NOAC or LAAC) needs to be individualized to patients' 
thromboembolic and bleeding risk and life expectancy. This review on LAAC 
provides an update on contemporary devices and techniques, as well as 
recommendations for patient selection and management.

Improvements to Healthspan Through Environmental Enrichment and Lifestyle 
Interventions: Where Are We Now?

Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental paradigm that is used to 
explore how a complex, stimulating environment can impact overall health. In 
laboratory animal experiments, EE housing conditions typically include 
larger-than-standard cages, abundant bedding, running wheels, mazes, toys, and 
shelters which are rearranged regularly to further increase stimulation. EE has 
been shown to improve multiple aspects of health, including but not limited to 
metabolism, learning and cognition, anxiety and depression, and 
immunocompetence. Recent advances in lifespan have led some researchers to 
consider aging as a risk factor for disease. As such, there is a pressing need 
to understand the processes by which healthspan can be increased. The natural 
and predictable changes during aging can be reversed or decreased through EE and 
its underlying mechanisms. Here, we review the use of EE in laboratory animals 
to understand mechanisms involved in aging, and comment on relative areas of 
strength and weakness in the current literature. We additionally address current 
efforts toward applying EE-like lifestyle interventions to human health to 
extend healthspan. Although increasing lifespan is a clear goal of medical 
research, improving the quality of this added time also deserves significant 
attention. Despite hurdles in translating experimental results toward clinical 
application, we argue there is great potential in using features of EE toward 
improving human healthy life expectancy or healthspan, especially in the context 
of increased global longevity.

Mini Review: Opposing Pathologies in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease: Does the 
PI3K/Akt Pathway Provide Clues?

Sciences, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.

This minireview is a brief overview examining the roles of insulin-like growth 
factors (IGFs) and the PI3K/Akt pathway in two apparently unconnected diseases: 
Alzheimer's dementia and cancer. For both, increased age is a major risk factor, 
and, in accord with the global rise in average life expectancy, their prevalence 
is also increasing. Cancer, however, involves excessive cell proliferation and 
metastasis, whereas Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves cell death and tissue 
destruction. The apparent "inverse" nature of these disease states is examined 
here, but also some important commonalities in terms of the PI3K/Akt pathway, 
glucose utilization and cell deregulation/death. The focus here is on four key 
molecules associated with this pathway; notably, the insulin receptor substrate 
1 (IRS-1), cellular tumor antigen p53 (p53), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 
NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 
(LRP1), all previously identified as potential therapeutic targets for both 
diseases. The insulin-resistant state, commonly reported in AD brain, results in 
neuronal glucose deprivation, due to a dampening down of the PI3K/Akt pathway, 
including overactivity of the mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) complex, 
hyperphosphorylation of p53 and neuronal death. This contrasts with cancer, 
where there is overstimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the suppression of 
mTORC1 and p53, enabling abundant energy and unrestrained cell proliferation. 
Although these disease states appear to be diametrically opposed, the same key 
molecules are controlling pathology and, with differential targeting of 
therapeutics, may yet provide a beneficial outcome for both.

As the global population ages, the number of geriatric patients requiring 
surgery for colon cancer would inevitably increase. Radical oncological surgery 
in the elderly colorectal cancer patient has been recognized to be associated 
with a higher rate of postoperative complications and mortality compared to the 
young. While less aggressive management options may be reasonable in patients 
with limited life expectancy and significant comorbidities, many elderly 
patients have preserved function despite their chronological age. The advances 
in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) now provide a feasible means of achieving 
safe oncological treatment for these geriatric patients. This review focuses on 
the evidence behind MIS in the geriatric patient with colon cancer.

One of the major impacts following a neck of femur fracture is pain. Most 
patients (nearly all) undergo an operation. This usually includes the frailest 
terminal patients and deemed a palliative procedure to reduce ongoing pain. The 
operation comes with risks and can reduce life expectancy in these patients and 
result in prolonged hospital admission, delirium, and postoperative 
complications. This case highlights a novel approach to managing the frailest 
end-of-life patients that does not require them to undergo a conventional 
operation. The case resulted in a quick discharge from hospital and for the 
patient and family to maximise the time out of hospital, with a reduced 
analgesic burden and a peaceful passing away. We feel that this could be an 
alternative, more humane option for such patients.
