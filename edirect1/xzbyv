CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to recent research from other European countries, 
limitation of treatment with expected or intended shortening of life is 
frequently performed amongst the investigated sample. The role of clinical and 
non-medical aspects possibly relevant for physicians' decision about withholding 
or withdrawal of treatment with possible or intended shortening of life and 
reasons for non-involvement of patients should be explored in more detail by 
means of mixed method and interdisciplinary empirical-ethical analysis.

BACKGROUND: Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients with moderate or 
great defect complexity are at risk for premature death. Although early 
engagement in advance care planning (ACP) is recommended, previous research 
suggests that it seldom occurs.
METHODS: This study investigated ACHD patient preferences for ACP and factors 
that impact preferences. ACHD patients completed an ACP preferences 
questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a measure of 
attachment styles.
RESULTS: Of 152 ACHD patients (median age 33years, 50% female), 13% reported 
previous ACP discussions with providers and 21% had completed advance 
directives. On a 0-10 scale, the median rating for the importance of discussing 
ACP with providers was 7; 18years was identified as the most appropriate age to 
initiate this dialogue. Higher ratings for the importance of discussing ACP with 
providers was observed in patients who were female (p=0.03), had lower disease 
complexity (p=0.03), and had elevated anxiety symptoms (p=0.001); elevated 
anxiety remained significant in a multivariable model. Interest in receiving 
information about life expectancy (61% overall) was greater among patients with 
lower disease complexity (p=0.04) and a history of ≥2 cardiac surgeries 
(p=0.01); disease complexity remained significant in a multivariable model.
CONCLUSIONS: As a group, ACHD patients value the opportunity for ACP discussions 
and prefer earlier communication. Although some clinicians might avoid ACP 
discussions in patients who are generally more anxious or have less complex CHD, 
such avoidance does not appear to be warranted.

OBJECTIVES: This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 
hydrophilic coated to uncoated catheters for patients performing urinary 
intermittent catheterisation. A national budget impact analysis is also included 
to evaluate the impact of intermittent catheterisation for management of bladder 
dysfunctions over a period of 5 years.
DESIGN: A Markov model (lifetime horizon, 1 year cycle length) was developed to 
project health outcomes (life years and quality-adjusted life years) and 
economic consequences related to patients using hydrophilic coated or uncoated 
catheters. The model was populated with catheter-related clinical efficacy data 
retrieved from randomised controlled trials and quality-of-life data (utility 
weights) from the literature. Cost data (EUR, 2015) were estimated on the basis 
of healthcare resource consumption derived from an e-survey addressed to key 
opinion leaders in the field.
SETTING: Italian Healthcare Service perspective.
POPULATION: Patients with spinal cord injury performing intermittent urinary 
catheterisation in the home setting.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios 
(ICER and ICUR) of hydrophilic coated versus uncoated catheters and associated 
healthcare budget impact.
RESULTS: The base-case ICER and ICUR associated with hydrophilic coated 
catheters were €20 761 and €24 405, respectively. This implies that hydrophilic 
coated catheters are likely to be cost-effective in comparison to uncoated ones, 
as proposed Italian threshold values range between €25 000 and €66 400. 
Considering a market share at year 5 of 89% hydrophilic catheters and 11% 
uncoated catheters, the additional cost for Italy is approximately €12 million 
in the next 5 years (current market share scenario for year 0: 80% hydrophilic 
catheters and 20% uncoated catheters).
CONCLUSIONS: Considered over a lifetime, hydrophilic coated catheters are 
potentially a cost-effective choice in comparison to uncoated ones. These 
findings can assist policymakers in evaluating intermittent catheterisation in 
patients with spinal cord injury.

IMPORTANCE: Elevated systolic blood (SBP) pressure is a leading global health 
risk. Quantifying the levels of SBP is important to guide prevention policies 
and interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg 
and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher and the burden of different causes of death and 
disability by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015.
DESIGN: A comparative risk assessment of health loss related to SBP. Estimated 
distribution of SBP was based on 844 studies from 154 countries (published 
1980-2015) of 8.69 million participants. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression was used to generate estimates of mean SBP and adjusted variance for 
each age, sex, country, and year. Diseases with sufficient evidence for a causal 
relationship with high SBP (eg, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and 
hemorrhagic stroke) were included in the primary analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean SBP level, cause-specific deaths, and health 
burden related to SBP (≥110-115 mm Hg and also ≥140 mm Hg) by age, sex, country, 
and year.
RESULTS: Between 1990-2015, the rate of SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg 
increased from 73 119 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 67 949-78 241) to 81 373 
(95% UI, 76 814-85 770) per 100 000, and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased 
from 17 307 (95% UI, 17 117-17 492) to 20 526 (95% UI, 20 283-20 746) per 
100 000. The estimated annual death rate per 100 000 associated with SBP of at 
least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 135.6 (95% UI, 122.4-148.1) to 145.2 (95% 
UI 130.3-159.9) and the rate for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 97.9 
(95% UI, 87.5-108.1) to 106.3 (95% UI, 94.6-118.1). For loss of DALYs associated 
with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 
95.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 87.0-104.9 million) to 143.0 
million (95% UI, 130.2-157.0 million) [corrected], and for SBP of 140 mm Hg or 
higher, the loss increased from 5.2 million (95% UI, 4.6-5.7 million) to 7.8 
million (95% UI, 7.0-8.7 million). The largest numbers of SBP-related deaths 
were caused by ischemic heart disease (4.9 million [95% UI, 4.0-5.7 million]; 
54.5%), hemorrhagic stroke (2.0 million [95% UI, 1.6-2.3 million]; 58.3%), and 
ischemic stroke (1.5 million [95% UI, 1.2-1.8 million]; 50.0%). In 2015, China, 
India, Russia, Indonesia, and the United States accounted for more than half of 
the global DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In international surveys, although there is 
uncertainty in some estimates, the rate of elevated SBP (≥110-115 and ≥140 mm 
Hg) increased substantially between 1990 and 2015, and DALYs and deaths 
associated with elevated SBP also increased. Projections based on this sample 
suggest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP of at least 110 to 
115 mm Hg and 874 million adults had SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher.

AIM: To estimate real-world cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and value-based 
price range of evolocumab for a US-context, high-risk, secondary-prevention 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Burden of CVD was assessed using the UK-based Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in order to capture complete CV burden 
including CV mortality. Patients on standard of care (SOC; high-intensity 
statins) in CPRD were selected based on eligibility criteria of FOURIER, a phase 
3 CV outcomes trial of evolocumab, and categorized into four cohorts: high-risk 
prevalent atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) cohort (n = 1448), acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS) (n = 602), ischemic stroke (IS) (n = 151), and heart failure (HF) 
(n = 291) incident cohorts. The value-based price range for evolocumab was 
assessed using a previously published economic model. The model incorporated 
CPRD CV event rates and considered CV event reduction rate ratios per 1 mmol/L 
reduction in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) from a meta-analysis of 
statin trials by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC), i.e. 
CTTC relationship.
RESULTS: Multiple-event rates of composite CV events (ACS, IS, or coronary 
revascularization) per 100 patient-years were 12.3 for the high-risk prevalent 
ASCVD cohort, and 25.7, 13.3, and 23.3, respectively, for incident ACS, IS, and 
HF cohorts. Approximately one-half (42%) of the high-risk ASCVD patients with a 
new CV event during follow-up had a subsequent CV event. Combining these 
real-world event rates and the CTTC relationship in the economic model, the 
value-based price range (credible interval) under a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $150,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained for evolocumab was $11,990 
($9,341-$14,833) to $16,856 ($12,903-$20,678) in ASCVD patients with baseline 
LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL and ≥100 mg/dL, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Real-world CVD burden is substantial. Using the observed CVD burden 
in CPRD and the CTTC relationship, the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that, 
accounting for uncertainties, the expected value-based price for evolocumab is 
higher than its current annual cost, as long as the payer discount off list 
price is greater than 20%.

Quantification of the sources and composition of particulate matter by 
field-deployable mass spectrometry: implications for air quality and public 
health.

Hayes PL(1).

Author information:

Airborne particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) negatively 
impacts air quality in cities throughout the world where it has been linked to 
increased cardiac and respiratory morbidity and mortality. For this reason PM2.5 
standards have been established by many countries and the World Health 
Organization. However, these guidelines are regularly exceeded in North America, 
Europe and East Asia. While PM2.5 is often reported as a single atmospheric 
species, it is actually a mixture of organic and inorganic compounds. The 
organic fraction, termed organic aerosol (OA), contributes approximately 20-70% 
of the PM2.5 mass globally, and OA itself is a complex mixture of thousands of 
compounds. Characterizing the chemical properties of OA represents a major 
analytical challenge that has motivated the development of a range of new 
instruments. The focus of this perspective is the use of field-deployable mass 
spectrometers and in particular the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) for 
chemically characterizing submicron particles. Field measurements of the 
composition of PM2.5 are directly relevant to evaluating its health impact 
because reductions in life expectancy due to PM2.5 vary according to 
composition. In addition, AMS measurements are especially useful for 
characterizing OA. The sources of OA are not well understood as evidenced by the 
performance of many air quality models, including those run by government 
agencies, which lack accurate and well constrained parameterizations for 
simulating secondary OA concentrations in urban regions. Given that OA is an 
important component of the total PM2.5 mass, this uncertainty makes accurate 
evaluation of the impact of PM2.5 on public health difficult, especially when 
evaluating future mitigation strategies. The development of the AMS has been a 
critical step towards addressing this public health challenge in that it 
provides quantitative data regarding particulate matter and OA concentration and 
composition that can be used to constrain uncertainties in air quality models.

There is an exponential increase in dementia in old age at a global level 
because of increasing life expectancy. The prevalence of neurodegenerative 
diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) will continue to rise 
steadily, and is expected to reach 42 million cases worldwide in 2020. Despite 
the advancement of medication, the management of these diseases remains largely 
ineffective. Therefore, it is vital to explore novel nature-based nutraceuticals 
to mitigate AD and other age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Mushrooms and 
their extracts appear to hold many health benefits, including immune-modulating 
effects. A number of edible mushrooms have been shown to contain rare and exotic 
compounds that exhibit positive effects on brain cells both in vitro and in 
vivo. In this review, we summarize the scientific information on edible and 
culinary mushrooms with regard to their antidementia/AD active compounds and/or 
pharmacological test results. The bioactive components in these mushrooms and 
the underlying mechanism of their activities are discussed. In short, these 
mushrooms may be regarded as functional foods for the mitigation of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

We describe cases of collyriclosis in apodiform and passeriform birds in 
Portugal, Switzerland, and Germany. We extend the host range of Collyriculm faba 
to include apodiform birds ( Apus apus , Apus melba , and Apus pallidus ) and 
the passerine Sitta europaea (Eurasian Nuthatch). Infections varied in severity 
from an incidental finding to severe debilitation and death. The infection route 
remains unclear with the apparent absence from Germany, Portugal, and 
Switzerland of the first intermediate host of C. faba, the aquatic gastropod 
Bythinella austriaca, implying that other organisms might be involved in the 
parasite's life cycle. Furthermore, the detection of C. faba cysts in very young 
passerine birds may indicate an infection during the nestling stage and a rapid 
development of parasite-containing subcutaneous cysts. This series of cases 
highlights an increased geographic range into Portugal and the potential 
debilitating nature of a parasite of migratory birds in Europe. However, given 
the rarity of cases, collyriclosis does not seem to present an important threat 
to migratory species preservation.

BACKGROUND: The epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low and middle 
income countries (LMICs) is widely recognised as the next major challenge to 
global health. However, in many LMICs, infectious diseases are still prevalent 
resulting in a "double burden" of disease. With increased life expectancy and 
longevity with HIV, older adults may particularly be at risk of this double 
burden. Here we describe the relative contributions of infections and NCDs to 
hospital admissions and mortality, according to age, in Malawi's largest 
hospital.
METHODS: Primary diagnosis on discharge/death, mortality rates, and HIV status 
were recorded prospectively on consecutive adult medical in-patients over 2 
years using an electronic medical records system. Diagnoses were classified as 
infections or NCDs and analysed according to age and gender.
FINDINGS: 10,191 records were analysed. Overall, infectious diseases, 
particularly those associated with HIV, were the leading cause of admission. 
However, in adults ≥55 years, NCDs were the commonest diagnoses. In adults <55 
years 71% of deaths were due to infections whereas in adults ≥55 years 56% of 
deaths were due to NCDs.
INTERPRETATION: Infectious diseases are still the leading cause of adult 
admission to a central hospital in Malawi but in adults aged ≥55 years NCDs are 
the most frequent diagnoses. HIV was an underlying factor in the majority of 
adults with infections and was also present in 53% of those with NCDs. These 
findings highlight the need for further health sector shifts to address the 
double burden of infectious and NCDs, particularly in the ageing population.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy is accompanied by a growing number 
of elderly subjects affected by chronic comorbidities, a health issue which also 
implies important socioeconomic consequences. Shifting from hospital or 
community dwelling care towards a home personalized healthcare paradigm would 
promote active aging with a better quality of life, along with a reduction in 
healthcare-related costs.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the SMARTA project was to develop and test an innovative 
personal health system integrating standard sensors as well as innovative 
wearable and environmental sensors to allow home telemonitoring of vital 
parameters and detection of anomalies in daily activities, thus supporting 
active aging through remote healthcare.
METHODS: A first phase of the project consisted in the definition of the health 
and environmental parameters to be monitored (electrocardiography and 
actigraphy, blood pressure and oxygen saturation, weight, ear temperature, 
glycemia, home interaction monitoring - water tap, refrigerator, and 
dishwasher), the feedbacks for the clinicians, and the reminders for the 
patients. It was followed by a technical feasibility analysis leading to an 
iterative process of prototype development, sensor integration, and testing. 
Once the prototype had reached an advanced stage of development, a group of 32 
volunteers - including 15 healthy adult subjects, 13 elderly people with cardiac 
diseases, and 4 clinical operators - was recruited to test the system in a real 
home setting, in order to evaluate both technical reliability and user 
perception of the system in terms of effectiveness, usability, acceptance, and 
attractiveness.
RESULTS: The testing in a real home setting showed a good perception of the 
SMARTA system and its functionalities both by the patients and by the 
clinicians, who appreciated the user interface and the clinical governance 
system. The moderate system reliability of 65-70% evidenced some technical 
issues, mainly related to sensor integration, while the patient's user interface 
showed excellent reliability (100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Both elderly people and clinical operators considered the SMARTA 
system a promising and attractive tool for improving patients' healthcare while 
reducing related costs and preserving quality of life. However, the moderate 
reliability of the system should prompt further technical developments in terms 
of sensor integration and usability of the clinical operator's user interface.

BACKGROUND: The progression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) within host 
includes typical stages and the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is shown to be 
effective in slowing down this progression. There are great challenges in 
describing the entire HIV disease progression and evaluating comprehensive 
effects of ART on life expectancy for HIV infected individuals on ART.
METHODS: We develop a novel summative treatment benefit index (TBI), based on an 
HIV viral dynamics model and linking the infection and viral production rates to 
the Weibull function. This index summarizes the integrated effect of ART on the 
life expectancy (LE) of a patient, and more importantly, can be reconstructed 
from the individual clinic data.
RESULTS: The proposed model, faithfully mimicking the entire HIV disease 
progression, enables us to predict life expectancy and trace back the timing of 
infection. We fit the model to the longitudinal data in a cohort study in China 
to reconstruct the treatment benefit index, and we describe the dependence of 
individual life expectancy on key ART treatment specifics including the timing 
of ART initiation, timing of emergence of drug resistant virus variants and ART 
adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that combining model predictions with monitored CD4 counts 
and viral loads can provide critical information about the disease progression, 
to assist the design of ART regimen for maximizing the treatment benefits.

This study aimed to estimate the disease burden of hepatitis E in a rural region 
in China. A total of 489 hepatitis E cases were reported according to a 
community-based survey in an active hepatitis surveillance system between 2008 
and 2015, the questionnaire and record-review methods were constructed to 
evaluate the economic and health burden of hepatitis E virus infections from 
societal perspectives. All costs were converted to US$ in 2015. The 
age-standardized cumulative incidence rate was 107·9/100 000, and the median 
age-standardized annual incidence rate was 16·5/100 000. The median direct, 
indirect, and intangible cost were $1046·0, $49·1, and $77·3/patient, 
respectively, and the median economic burden per patient was $1836·5, which 
accounted for 51·2% of per capita disposable income. Moreover, the median 
quality-adjusted life year and visual analogue scale score were 0·7 and 
70·0/case, respectively. Both economic burden and health burden of inpatients 
was more serious than that of outpatients (P < 0·001). Disease burden of 
hepatitis E is heavy on patients, their families, and society. More studies on 
the disease burden of hepatitis E are necessary to increase social awareness of 
the disease and confirm reasonable disease-control measures.

Malignant tumor has become the top cause of deaths before the average life 
expectancy in Chinese population. From the variations in the morbidity rate and 
mortality rate of malignant tumor in the mainland of China between 2000 and 
2011, the primary prevention targeting the risk factors/etiological agents 
significantly reduced the morbidity rates of gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, 
and primary liver cancer, therefore reduced the mortality rates of these 
cancers. However, the contribution of clinical treatments to the mortality 
reduction was not obviously improved during this period. Importantly, it is 
necessary to conduct research to identify precancerous lesions and early tumors 
which are prone to progress to aggressive diseases for the active secondary 
prevention to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Multi-center, prospective 
randomized controlled clinical trials and prognosis evaluation independently 
carried out by third parts are needed to evaluate the longterm effectiveness of 
some clinical treatment efficiency for cancers with different histological 
types. On the basis of a series of population-based studies in China, the 
prevention and clinical treatments for malignant tumor need innovations on 
technology, management, and even concept; the mechanisms of "forward placement 
of strategic pass" for the prevention and control of malignant tumor should be 
established and improved to reduce the increasing disease burden due to 
malignant tumor in China.

恶性肿瘤是我国人口在平均寿命之前死亡的最主要原因。从2000-2011年中国大陆地区恶性肿瘤年龄调整发病率和死亡率的变化规律来看，针对危险因素／病因进行一级预防可以显著降低胃癌、食管癌和原发性肝癌的发病率，进而降低其死亡率，但在这12年中临床治疗对降低恶性肿瘤整体死亡率方面的贡献却没有明显提升。探索何种早期肿瘤能够快速进展为晚期肿瘤，并针对这些肿瘤的癌前病变和早期肿瘤开展积极、特异性二级预防是避免过度诊断和过度治疗的关键。需要多中心前瞻性随机对照临床试验和第三方独立随访研究来评价某些临床治疗方法对各种恶性肿瘤的长期疗效。恶性肿瘤防治实践需要在中国人群研究基础上进行技术、管理和观念的系列创新，建立并完善肿瘤防控的"关口前移"运行机制，以缓解和降低我国不断增长的疾病负担。.

OBJECTIVE: It is difficult to decide whether to treat unruptured intracranial 
aneurysm(UIA)in elderly patients aged ≥80 years because they have potentially 
shorter life expectancy and risks related to treatment. Here, we report the 
results of the treatment of patients aged ≥80 years.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in patients who underwent surgical 
or endovascular treatment between April 2012 and December 2015 at our 
institution.
RESULTS: Between April 2012 and December 2015 we treated 130 UIA patients who 
presented with 145 aneurysms and 12 patients who presented with 14 aneurysms, 
who were aged ≥80 years. One patient was male and the others were female. Their 
mean age was 81.9 years(range: 80-88 years). The aneurysms included ICA 
aneurysms(n=6), ACA aneurysms(n=1), MCA aneurysms(n=4), and BA aneurysms(n=3). 
The maximum sizes of the aneurysms were ≤5mm(n=3), 5-10mm(n=8), and ≥10mm(n=3). 
The reasons for treatment were as follows: symptomatic aneurysms(n=2), strong 
desire of the patient to treat their aneurysms(n=4), high risk of rupture 
because of the morphology of the aneurysm(n=4), concomitant presentation with a 
ruptured aneurysm(n=1), and recurrence after coil embolization(n=1). In the 
endovascular treatment we used dual anti-platelet drugs in all cases and a stent 
device in 3 cases. In all cases, we used general anesthesia. There were no 
complications during the operations or ischemic or hemorrhagic events after 
surgery. We identified subcutaneous hematoma at the puncture site in 2 cases. 
The modified Rankin Scale(mRS)score of no patient worsened compared to their 
preoperative mRS score. The average length of hospital stay was 31 days. In 
comparison with patients aged ≤79 years, there was no significant worsening of 
the mRS score. In patients aged ≥80 years, the length of their hospital stay was 
longer than that of younger patients.
CONCLUSION: While caution is warranted when treating UIA patients aged ≥80 
years, our findings for the treatment of aged patients were noteworthy. This 
treatment is meritorious if the indications are well considered and an 
experienced physician performs the operation. However, there are problems 
associated with using anti-platelet drugs in elderly patients.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an orexigenic peptide that plays an essential role in 
caloric restriction (CR)-mediated lifespan extension. However, the mechanisms 
underlying the NPY-mediated effects in CR are poorly defined. Here, we report 
that NPY deficiency in male mice during CR increases mortality in association 
with lipodystrophy. NPY-/- mice displayed a rapid decrease in body weight and 
fat mass, as well as increased lipolysis during CR. These alterations in fat 
regulation were inhibited by the lipolysis inhibitor, acipimox, a treatment 
associated with reduced mortality. The lipolytic/thermogenic signaling, 
β3-adrenergic receptor/hormone sensitive lipase, was markedly activated in white 
adipose tissue of NPY-/- mice compared with that of NPY+/+ mice, and 
thermogenesis was controlled by NPY under negative energy balance. These results 
demonstrate the critical role of NPY in the regulation of lipid metabolic 
homeostasis and survival via control of lipolysis and thermogenesis in a state 
of negative energy balance.

PURPOSE: To set a baseline measurement of the number of hand flexion-extension 
cycles and analyse the degree of motion in young healthy individuals, measured 
by leap motion controller (LMC), besides describing gender and dominant hand 
differences.
METHODS: Fifty healthy participants were asked to fully grip-and-release their 
dominant hand as rapidly as possible for a maximum of 3 min or until subjects 
fatigued, while wearing a non-metal wrist splint. Participants also performed a 
15-s grip-and-release test. An assessor blindly counted the frequency of 
grip-and-release cycles and magnitude of motion from the LMC data.
RESULTS: The mean number of the 15-s G-R cycles recorded by LMC was: 47.7 ± 6.5 
(test 1, LMC); and 50.2 ± 6.5 (test 2, LMC). In the 3-min test, the total number 
of hand flexion-extension cycles and the degree of motion decreased as the 
person fatigued. However, the decline in frequency preceded that of motion's 
magnitude. The mean frequency of cycles per 10-s interval decreased from 35.4 to 
26.6 over the 3 min. Participants reached fatigue from 59.38 s; 43 participants 
were able to complete the 3-min test.
CONCLUSIONS: Normative values of the frequency of cycles and extent of motion 
for young healthy individuals, aged 18-35 years, are provided. Future work is 
needed to establish values in a wider age range and in a clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: Continuation of antidepressant medication (ADM) after remission is 
widely used to prevent depressive relapse/recurrence. Little is known about 
predictors of ADM use in terms of adherence, dosage, and successful tapering. 
The current study aimed to explore beliefs about the causes of depression and 
recovery (i.e., causal beliefs) and to examine whether they predict ADM use.
METHODS: The data were drawn from a controlled trial and an extension of this 
trial with additional experience sampling. In total, 289 remitted patients with 
recurrent depression (ADM ≥ 6 months) were randomly assigned to Preventive 
Cognitive Therapy (PCT) with ADM tapering, PCT with maintenance ADM, or 
maintenance ADM alone. Adherence, ADM dosage, and causal beliefs regarding the 
first and last depressive episodes were explored via questionnaires.
RESULTS: Most patients mentioned stressful life events as cause of depression, 
although more patients tended to endorse external causes for the first episode 
and internal causes for the last episode. ADM was most often mentioned as 
helpful during recovery from both episodes. Over half of all patients were 
adherent and under half of the patients in the tapering condition were able to 
complete the taper. Causal beliefs did not predict ADM use.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that causal beliefs play little role in the use 
of maintenance ADM. More information is needed on factors contributing to 
successful tapering. The results must be interpreted with caution as this is not 
a naturalistic study and the results might be biased toward a more favorable 
view regarding ADM.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the nutraceutical potential of 
choline as an added value to its well-known brain nutrient role. Several 
toxicity, antitoxicity, genotoxicity, antigenotoxicity, and longevity endpoints 
were checked in the somatic mutation and recombination test in in vivo 
Drosophila animal model. Cytotoxicity in human leukemia-60 cell line (HL-60) 
promyelocytic and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, proapoptotic DNA fragmentation, 
comet assay, methylation status, and macroautophagy (MA) activity were tested in 
in vitro assays. Choline is not only safe but it is also able to protect against 
the DNA damage caused by an oxidative genotoxin. Moreover, it improves the life 
extension in the animal model. The in vitro results show that it is able to 
exhibit genetic damage against leukemia HL-60 cells. Single-strand breaks in DNA 
are observed at the molecular level in treatments with choline, although only a 
significant hypermethylation on the long interspersed elements-1 and a 
hypomethylation on the satellite-alpha DNA repetitive DNA sequences of HL-60 
cells at the lowest concentration (0.447 mM) were observed. Besides, choline 
decreased MA at the lower assayed concentration and the MA response to 
topoisomerase inhibitor (etoposide) is maintained in the presence of treatment 
with 0.22 mM choline. Taking into account the hopeful results obtained in the in 
vivo and in vitro assays, choline could be proposed as a substance with an 
important nutraceutical value for different purposes.

INTRODUCTION: haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a 
deficiency in one of the blood coagulation factors. For people affected by 
severe haemophilia, the deficiency can cause spontaneous internal bleeding. Most 
young people with severe haemophilia in the UK follow a preventative treatment 
regimen (prophylaxis) consisting of several intravenous injections of factor 
concentrate each week. There is good evidence that prophylaxis reduces bleeds 
whilst also improving quality of life. However, levels of adherence among young 
people with haemophilia reported in the existing literature vary widely and are 
predominately based on estimations made by healthcare professionals and parents. 
Additionally, drivers of (non)adherence among young people specifically have not 
been evidenced.
AIM: to assess self-reported adherence among young people with haemophilia, 
provide evidence of psychosocial predictors of adherence, and to establish the 
associations between non-adherence and number of bleeds and hospital visits.
METHODS: 91 participants were recruited during outpatient appointments in 13 
haemophilia centres across England and Wales, and invited to complete a 
questionnaire assessing self-reported adherence (VERITAS-Pro), 
Haemophilia-related pain and impact of pain, Illness Perceptions, Beliefs about 
Medications, Self-efficacy, Outcome expectations, Positive and Negative Affect, 
and Social support. Number of hospital visits and bleeds during the previous six 
months were collected from medical files.
RESULTS: Of 78 participants with complete data, just 18% had scores indicating 
non-adherence. Psychosocial predictors differed between intentional (skipping) 
and un-intentional (forgetting) non-adherence. Overall, however, better 
adherence was reported where participants perceived the need for prophylaxis was 
greater than their concern over taking it as well as having a positive 
expectancy of its effectiveness, good social support and a stronger emotional
