BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The feeling of mental well-being plays a role in mental 
and physical health, increased life expectancy, and sense of comfort and 
well-being in human beings. Moreover, quality of life along with economic and 
social indicators is the greatest desire and most important goal of human life. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of employment and 
economic status with the feeling of mental well-being in the elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive-analytical study, 200 elderly people 
living in Northern Iran, in 2018 were recruited to the study through available 
sampling method. The data collected using the Subjective Well-Being 
Questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive (mean, standard deviation, and 
frequency) and inferential statistical tests (Pearson correlation coefficient 
and linear regression). The significance level was considered at P<0.050.
RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of the age of the research units was 
69.00±8.22 years. The results showed that the mean of psychological well-being 
was higher than that of other dimensions (80.00±11.80), and emotional well-being 
had the lowest mean (37.00±6.36). The Pearson correlation coefficient test did 
not show a significant relationship between employment and feeling of mental 
well-being (P=0.550), but a positive and significant correlation was observed 
between economic status and feeling of mental well-being (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Due to the correlation between economic status and the feeling of 
mental well-being of elderly people, it is essential to consider the necessary 
solutions in this regard.

BACKGROUND: Healthy and predictable physiologic homeostasis is paramount in 
animal models for biomedical research. Proper macronutrient intake is an 
essential and controllable environmental factor for maintaining animal health 
and promoting experimental reproducibility.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Evaluate reductions in dietary macronutrient composition 
on body weight metrics, composition, and gut microbiome in Danio rerio.
METHODS: D. rerio were fed reference diets deficient in either protein or lipid 
content for 14 weeks.
RESULTS: Diets of reduced-protein or reduced-fat resulted in lower weight gain 
than the standard reference diet in male and female D. rerio. Females fed the 
reduced-protein diet had increased total body lipid, suggesting increased 
adiposity compared with females fed the standard reference diet. In contrast, 
females fed the reduced-fat diet had decreased total body lipid compared with 
females fed the standard reference diet. The microbial community in male and 
female D. rerio fed the standard reference diet displayed high abundances of 
Aeromonas, Rhodobacteraceae, and Vibrio. In contrast, Vibrio spp. were dominant 
in male and female D. rerio fed a reduced-protein diet, whereas Pseudomonas 
displayed heightened abundance when fed the reduced-fat diet. Predicted 
functional metagenomics of microbial communities (PICRUSt2) revealed a 3- to 
4-fold increase in the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) functional 
category of steroid hormone biosynthesis in both male and female D. rerio fed a 
reduced-protein diet. In contrast, an upregulation of secondary bile acid 
biosynthesis and synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies was concomitant with 
a downregulation in steroid hormone biosynthesis in females fed a reduced-fat 
diet.
CONCLUSIONS: These study outcomes provide insight into future investigations to 
understand nutrient requirements to optimize growth, reproductive, and health 
demographics to microbial populations and metabolism in the D. rerio gut 
ecosystem. These evaluations are critical in understanding the maintenance of 
steady-state physiologic and metabolic homeostasis in D. rerio. Curr Dev Nutr

INTRODUCTION: Ovarian aging has steadily grown to be a significant health issue 
for women as a result of the increase in average life expectancy and the 
postponement of reproductive age. One of the important pathological foundations 
of ovarian aging is formed by mitochondrial dysfunction, which causes decreases 
in follicle quantity and oocyte quality. In recent years, brown adipose tissue 
(BAT) transplantation has been proven as an effective treatment for 
aging-related diseases, such as ovarian aging. However, BAT transplantation is 
an invasive operation with long-term risks. Therefore, we need to find an 
alternative strategy.
METHODS: We injected BAT-derived exosomes into eight-month-old C57BL/6 female 
mice. The fertility was detected by the estrous cycle and mating test. The 
changes of ovary and oocyte were measured by ovarian volume, organ coefficient, 
follicle counting, and oocyte maturation rate. ROS level, mitochondrial membrane 
potential and ATP level were measured to analyze the mitochondrial function of 
oocytes. The changes in metabolism were explored by cold stimulation test, body 
weight and blood sugar. The possible molecular mechanism was further 
investigated by RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: In terms of fertility, the estrous cycle of aging mice after 
BAT-derived exosome intervention was more regular, and the number of progenies 
and litters was increased. At the tissue level, the ovaries in the BAT-exosome 
group were larger, and the number of primordial follicles, secondary follicles, 
antral follicles and total follicles increased. At the cellular level, 
BAT-derived exosomes improved the maturation of oocytes in vivo and in vitro, 
increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels of oocytes, and 
decreased ROS levels. Besides, BAT-derived exosomes ameliorated the metabolism 
and viability of aging mice. Furthermore, mRNA sequencing showed that BAT 
exosomes altered the expression levels of genes related to metabolism and the 
quality of oocytes.
CONCLUSION: BAT-derived exosomes enhanced mitochondrial function, promoted 
follicle survival, improved fertility, and extended ovarian lifespan in aging 
mice.

Most events that limit life expectancy after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (allo-HSCT) occur within the first 2 years; however, treatment 
outcomes in long-term survivors who survive for at least 2 years post-HSCT 
without relapse are yet to be elucidated. To explore the life expectancy trends 
and late complications and to assess the main mortality-related factors, we 
investigated the characteristics of patients who received allo-HSCT for 
haematological malignancies from 2007 to 2019 in our centre and survived in 
remission for 2 years. A cohort of 831 patients was enrolled; of these, 508 
received grafts from haploidentical-related donors (61.1%). The estimated 
overall survival rate at 10 years was 91.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
89.8-93.5), which was affected by prior grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.98; 95% CI, 1.47-6.03; p = 0.002) and 
severe chronic GVHD (HR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.93-6.71; p < 0.001). The probability of 
late relapse and non-relapse mortality at 10 years was 8.7% (95% CI, 6.9-10.8) 
and 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5-5.1) respectively. The top cause of late mortality was 
relapsed (49.0%). Projected long-term survival in 2-year disease-free survivors 
following allo-HSCT was excellent. Strategies should be implemented to minimise 
the late death-specific hazards in recipients.

BACKGROUND: Several chronic diseases accelerate cognitive decline; however, it 
is still unknown how different patterns of multimorbidity influence individuals' 
trajectories across the cognitive continuum.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the impact of multimorbidity and of specific 
multimorbidity patterns on the transitions across cognitive stages (normal 
cognition, cognitive impairment, no dementia [CIND], dementia) and death.
METHODS: We included 3122 dementia-free individuals from the Swedish National 
study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen. Using fuzzy c-means cluster analysis, 
multimorbid participants were classified into mutually exclusive groups 
characterized by commonly coexisting chronic diseases. Participants were 
followed up to 18 years to detect incident CIND, dementia, or death. Transition 
hazard ratios (HRs), life expectancies, and time spent in different cognitive 
stages were estimated using multistate Markov models.
RESULTS: At baseline, five multimorbidity patterns were identified: 
neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, sensory impairment/cancer, 
respiratory/metabolic/musculoskeletal, and unspecific. Compared to the 
unspecific pattern, the neuropsychiatric and sensory impairment/cancer ones 
showed reduced hazards of reverting from CIND to normal cognition (HR 0.53, 95% 
CI 0.33-0.85 and HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39-0.91). Participants in the cardiovascular 
pattern exhibited an increased hazard of progression from CIND to dementia (HR 
1.70, 95% CI 1.15-2.52) and for all transitions to death. Subjects with the 
neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular patterns showed reduced life expectancy at 
age 75, with an anticipation of CIND (up to 1.6 and 2.2 years, respectively) and 
dementia onset (up to 1.8 and 3.3 years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity patterns differentially steer individual 
trajectories across the cognitive continuum of older adults and may be used as a 
risk stratification tool.

BACKGROUND: Management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is complex, 
balancing the risk of rupture and risk of treatment. Therefore, prediction 
scores have been developed to support clinicians in the management of UIAs. We 
analyzed the discrepancies between interdisciplinary cerebrovascular board 
decision-making factors and the results of the prediction scores in our cohort 
of patients who received microsurgical treatment of UIAs.
METHODS: Clinical, radiological, and demographical data of 221 patients 
presenting with 276 microsurgically treated aneurysms were collected, from 
January 2013 to June 2020. UIATS, PHASES, and ELAPSS were calculated for each 
treated aneurysm, resulting in subgroups favoring treatment or conservative 
management for each score. Cerebrovascular board decision-factors were collected 
and analyzed.
RESULTS: UIATS, PHASES, and ELAPSS recommended conservative management in 87 
(31.5%) respectively in 110 (39.9%) and in 81 (29.3%) aneurysms. The 
cerebrovascular board decision-factors leading to treatment in these aneurysms 
(recommended to manage conservatively in the three scores) were: high life 
expectancy/young age (50.0%), angioanatomical factors (25.0%), multiplicity of 
aneurysms (16.7%). Analysis of cerebrovascular board decision-making factors in 
the "conservative management" subgroup of the UIATS showed that angioanatomical 
factors (P=0.001) led more frequently to surgery. PHASES and ELAPSS subgroups 
"conservative management" were more frequently treated due to clinical risk 
factors (P=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed more aneurysms were treated based on 
"real-world" decision-making than recommended by the scores. This is because 
these scores are models trying to reproduce reality, which is yet not fully 
understood. Aneurysms, which were recommended to manage conservatively, were 
treated mainly because of angioanatomy, high life expectancy, clinical risk 
factors, and patient's treatment wish. The UIATS is suboptimal regarding 
assessment of angioanatomy, the PHASES regarding clinical risk factors, 
complexity, and high life expectancy, and the ELAPSS regarding clinical risk 
factors and multiplicity of aneurysms. These findings support the need to 
optimize prediction models of UIAs.

With increasing evidence of global warming, the pressure is building to limit 
greenhouse gas emission from many human activities including dairy production 
systems. In this context, the present study was conducted to estimate the carbon 
footprint (CF) of cattle milk produced in the Hisar district of Haryana, India. 
The data about feeding practices, crops grown, manure management systems, etc. 
was collected through personal interviews with cattle-rearing rural male farmers 
chosen through multistep random sampling. The life cycle assessment (LCA) 
methodology was adopted to estimate carbon footprint, with the system boundary 
being "Cradle to farm gate." The latest methodologies prescribed by the IPCC 
were used to estimate GHG emissions using the tier-2 approach. The current study 
has presented a detailed and recent GHG inventory from smallholder cattle farms 
at the village level. On the basis of the inventory analysis, a simplified life 
cycle-based analysis is used in order to quantify the carbon footprint of fat- 
and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). The carbon footprint of cattle milk was 
estimated at 2.13 kg CO2-eq/kilogram FPCM. Enteric fermentation was the most 
potent contributor to GHG, contributing around 35.5% of the total emissions, 
followed by manure management (13.8%) and soil management (8.2%). Further 
studies to accurately estimate carbon footprint are advocated besides suggesting 
ways to reduce GHG emissions and using efficient production technologies.

The therapeutic potential of curcumin for many diseases are intensively 
investigated. However, real-world observational data documenting health and 
longevity effects associated with dietary curcumin in turmeric from consuming 
curry in food is lacking. A prospective cohort study of 4551 adults aged 
55 + assessed curry consumption (never or < once/year, ≥ once/year 
to < once/month, ≥ once/month to < once/week, ≥ once/week to < daily, ≥ once 
daily), prevalent health conditions, blood biomarker indexes of atherogenicity, 
insulin resistance, and inflammation at baseline, and mean (SD) 11.6 (3.8) year 
follow up of all-cause, CVS and cancer mortality. There were linear positive 
associations of increasing curry consumption with waist circumference, fasting 
blood glucose, TyG, AIP, CRI-1, CRI-2, central obesity and diabetes prevalence, 
and inverse association with eGFR. There were non-linear associations with 
FEV1/height2 and COPD prevalence, GDS score and depression, MMSE score and 
cognitive impairment, comorbidity count, serum albumin and haemoglobin, being 
most favourable with moderate consumption. The levels of NLR, PLR and SII 
indices of systemic and immune inflammation decreased linearly with curry 
consumption. Total mortality HR adjusted for baseline co-variables, decreased 
across curry consumption, 0.68 (95%CI 0.56-0.82), 0.54 (95%CI 0.43-0.69), 0.70 
(0.52-0.93), and 0.62 (0.41-0.95), being lowest in the middle categories. Among 
participants with cardio-metabolic and vascular diseases (CMVD), at least 
occasional curry consumption was associated with decreased mortality risk by 
39%, and increased life expectancy by 1.0 years. Among those without CMVD, the 
associated life expectancy increase was 1.9 years. Moderate curry consumption 
may confer meaningful longevity benefits.

IMPORTANCE: While knowing the goals of care (GOCs) for children receiving 
pediatric palliative care (PPC) are crucial for guiding the care they receive, 
how parents prioritize these goals and how their priorities may change over time 
is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To determine parental prioritization of GOCs and patterns of change 
over time for parents of children receiving palliative care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Pediatric Palliative Care Research 
Network's Shared Data and Research cohort study with data collected at 0, 2, 6, 
12, 18, and 24 months in hospital, outpatient, or home settings from April 10, 
2017, to February 15, 2022, at 7 PPC programs based at children's hospitals 
across the US. Participants included parents of patients, birth to 30 years of 
age, who received PPC services.
EXPOSURES: Analyses were adjusted for demographic characteristics, number of 
complex chronic conditions, and time enrolled in PPC.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Parents' importance scores, as measured using a discrete choice 
experiment, of 5 preselected GOCs: seeking quality of life (QOL), health, 
comfort, disease modification, or life extension. Importance scores for the 5 
GOCs summed to 100.
RESULTS: A total of 680 parents of 603 patients reported on GOCs. Median patient 
age was 4.4 (IQR, 0.8-13.2) years and 320 patients were male (53.1%). At 
baseline, parents scored QOL as the most important goal (mean score, 31.5 [SD, 
8.4]), followed by health (26.3 [SD, 7.5]), comfort (22.4 [SD, 11.7]), disease 
modification (10.9 [SD, 9.2]), and life extension (8.9 [SD, 9.9]). Importantly, 
parents varied substantially in their baseline scores for each goal (IQRs more 
than 9.4), but across patients in different complex chronic conditions 
categories, the mean scores varied only slightly (means differ 8.7 or less). For 
each additional study month since PPC initiation, QOL was scored higher by 0.06 
(95% CI, 0.04-0.08) and comfort scored higher by 0.3 (95% CI, 0-0.06), while the 
importance score for life extension decreased by 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04-0.09) and 
disease modification by 0.02 (95% CI, 0-0.04); health scores did not 
significantly differ from PPC initiation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parents of children receiving PPC placed the highest 
value on QOL, but with considerable individual-level variation and substantial 
change over time. These findings emphasize the importance of reassessing GOCs 
with parents to guide appropriate clinical intervention.

Aim      To analyze the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in 40- 
and 65-year-old patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).Material and methods  
Analysis was performed by Markov modeling from the perspective of the healthcare 
system. The evaluation was based on Russian epidemiological data taking into 
account results of international studies. The analyzed schedule of vaccination 
included one dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed 
by 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) after one year and vaccination with 
only one dose of PCV13. The time horizon of the study was 5 years. Costs and 
life expectancy were discounted at 3.5% per year.Results The cost-effectiveness 
of vaccination for both 65-year-old and 40-year-old CHF patients is very high: 
the incremental cost of one additional QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year) for 
PCV13+PPSV23 vaccination is 113.24 thousand rubles, while vaccination with PCV13 
entails a reduction in costs by 556.50 rubles per one vaccinated patient. For 
vaccination of 40-year-old CHF patients with PCV13+PPSV23, the incremental costs 
per 1 QALY will be 519.72 thousand rubles, while for vaccination with PCV13 it 
will be 99.33 thousand rubles.Conclusion      Pneumococcal vaccination of CHF 
patients reduces the associated morbidity and mortality and is highly cost 
effective.

The study aimed to evaluate the effect of nasoalveolar molding (NAM) therapy 
through reverse engineering, or its absence, to obtain symmetry of the face and 
maxillary arch. Twenty-six babies with unilateral cleft lip and palate received 
treatment with NAM, and 12 babies with unilateral cleft lip and palate without 
presurgical orthopedics (control group). Patients were molded and photographed 
in 2-stages: the first month of life (T1/pre) and after the use of NAM/before 
the cheiloplasty (T2/post). In the digital models, the analyses performed were 
arch perimeter, arch length, and labial frenulum angle. The photographs allowed 
us to analyze nasal width, mouth width, columella angle, and nostril area. The 
results demonstrated that there was an increase in arch perimeter and arch 
length in control and NAM groups in the T2 period in comparison to T1. Labial 
frenulum angle was reduced in the NAM group compared to the NAM-T1 and 
control-T2 periods. Treatment with NAM yielded a reduction in nasal width in the 
period of T2 compared with T1. Columella angle was enhanced after NAM use in T2 
and, was different from control group. The nostril area was reduced in the NAM 
group in T2 compared with control group. Nasoalveolar molding therapy reduced 
the labial frenulum angle, contributing to a reduction in the extension of the 
cleft. The NAM protocol improved facial symmetry, mainly through nasal effects, 
whereas the absence of orthopedic therapy yielded a commitment to the face and 
maxillary arch symmetry.

Flowers have a species-specific fertile period during which pollination and 
fertilization have to occur to initiate seed and fruit development. Unpollinated 
flowers remain receptive for mere hours in some species, and up to several weeks 
in others before flower senescence terminates fertility. As such, floral 
longevity is a key trait subject to both natural selection and plant breeding. 
Within the flower, the life span of the ovule containing the female gametophyte 
is decisive for fertilization and the initiation of seed development. Here, we 
show that unfertilized ovules in Arabidopsis thaliana undergo a senescence 
program that generates morphological and molecular hallmarks of canonical 
programmed cell death processes in the sporophytically derived ovule 
integuments. Transcriptome profiling of isolated aging ovules revealed 
substantial transcriptomic reprogramming during ovule senescence, and identified 
up-regulated transcription factors as candidate regulators of these processes. 
Combined mutation of three most-up-regulated NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) 
transcription factors, NAP/ANAC029, SHYG/ANAC047, and ORE1/ANAC092, caused a 
substantial delay in ovule senescence and an extension of fertility in 
Arabidopsis ovules. These results suggest that timing of ovule senescence and 
duration of gametophyte receptivity are subject to genetic regulation controlled 
by the maternal sporophyte.

The oocyte is considered to be the largest cell in mammalian species. Women 
hoping to become pregnant face a ticking biological clock. This is becoming 
increasingly challenging as an increase in life expectancy is accompanied by the 
tendency to conceive at older ages. With advancing maternal age, the fertilized 
egg will exhibit lower quality and developmental competence, which contributes 
to increased chances of miscarriage due to several causes such as aneuploidy, 
oxidative stress, epigenetics, or metabolic disorders. In particular, 
heterochromatin in oocytes and with it, the DNA methylation landscape undergoes 
changes. Further, obesity is a well-known and ever-increasing global problem as 
it is associated with several metabolic disorders. More importantly, both 
obesity and aging negatively affect female reproduction. However, among women, 
there is immense variability in age-related decline of oocytes' quantity, 
developmental competence, or quality. Herein, the relevance of obesity and 
DNA-methylation will be discussed as these aspects have a tremendous effect on 
female fertility, and it is a topic of continuous and widespread interest that 
has yet to be fully addressed for the mammalian oocyte.

BACKGROUND: When treating older women with breast cancer, life expectancy is an 
important consideration. ASCO recommends calculating 10-year mortality 
probabilities to inform treatment decisions. One useful tool is the Schonberg 
index, which predicts risk-based all-cause 10-year mortality. We investigated 
the use of this index in women aged ≥65 years with breast cancer in the Women's 
Health Initiative (WHI).
METHODS: We calculated 10-year mortality risk scores for 2,549 WHI participants 
with breast cancer ("cases") and 2,549 age-matched breast cancer-free 
participants ("controls") using Schonberg index risk scoring. Risk scores were 
grouped into quintiles for comparisons. Risk-stratified observed mortality rates 
and 95% confidence intervals were compared across cases and controls. Observed 
10-year mortality rates in cases and controls were also compared with Schonberg 
index-based predicted 10-year mortality rates.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, cases were more often white (P=.005), had 
higher income and education levels (P<.001 for both), more often lived with 
their husband/partner (P<.001), scored higher on subjective health/happiness 
(P<.001), and needed less assistance in activities of daily living (P<.001). 
Participants with breast cancer had similar risk-stratified 10-year mortality 
rates compared with controls (34% vs 33%, respectively). Stratified results 
showed that cases had slightly higher mortality rates than controls in the 
lowest risk quintile and lower mortality rates in the 2 highest risk quintiles. 
Observed mortality rates in cases and controls were similar to Schonberg 
index-predicted mortality, with model c-indexes of 0.71 and 0.76, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Among women aged ≥65 years with incident breast cancer, the 
Schonberg index-based risk-stratified 10-year mortality rates were similar to 
those in women without breast cancer, demonstrating a similar performance of the 
index among both populations. Along with other health measures, prognostic 
indexes can help predict survival among older women with breast cancer and 
support geriatric oncology guidelines that promote using life expectancy 
calculation tools for shared decision-making.

Comment in
    Neurology. 2023 Aug 8;101(6):241-242.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive guidelines for the diagnosis, 
prognosis, and treatment of disorders of consciousness (DoC) in pediatric 
patients have not yet been released. We aimed to summarize available evidence 
for DoC with >14 days duration to support the future development of guidelines 
for children, adolescents and young adults aged 6 months-18 years.
METHODS: This scoping review was reported based on Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. A 
systematic search identified records from 4 databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
Library, and Web of Science. Abstracts received 3 blind reviews. Corresponding 
full-text articles rated as "in-scope" and reporting data not published in any 
other retained article (i.e., no double reporting) were identified and assigned 
to 5 thematic evaluating teams. Full-text articles were reviewed using a 
double-blind standardized form. Level of evidence was graded, and summative 
statements were generated.
RESULTS: On November 9, 2022, 2,167 documents had been identified; 132 articles 
were retained, of which 33 (25%) were published over the past 5 years. Overall, 
2,161 individuals met the inclusion criteria; female patients were 527 of 1,554 
(33.9%) cases included, whose sex was identifiable. Of 132 articles, 57 (43.2%) 
were single case reports and only 5 (3.8%) clinical trials; the level of 
evidence was prevalently low (80/132; 60.6%). Most studies included 
neurobehavioral measures (84/127; 66.1%) and neuroimaging (81/127; 63.8%); 59 
(46.5%) were mainly related to diagnosis, 56 (44.1%) to prognosis, and 44 
(34.6%) to treatment. Most frequently used neurobehavioral tools included the 
Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, Coma/Near-Coma Scale, Level of Cognitive 
Functioning Assessment Scale, and Post-Acute Level of Consciousness scale. EEG, 
event-related potentials, structural CT, and MRI were the most frequently used 
instrumental techniques. In 29/53 (54.7%) cases, DoC improvement was observed, 
which was associated with treatment with amantadine.
DISCUSSION: The literature on pediatric DoCs is mainly observational, and 
clinical details are either inconsistently presented or absent. Conclusions 
drawn from many studies convey insubstantial evidence and have limited validity 
and low potential for translation in clinical practice. Despite these 
limitations, our work summarizes the extant literature and constitutes a base 
for future guidelines related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of 
pediatric DoC.

Aegilops tauschii, as a donor of D genome to the bread wheat with a valuable 
source of resistance to different biotic and abiotic stresses, is used to 
improve the quality of wheat cultivars. Every genotype has a specific genetic 
content, the investigation of which can lead to the identification of useful 
genes such as stress tolerance genes, including drought. Therefore, 23 genotypes 
of Ae. tauschii were selected to evaluate their morphological and physiological 
traits under greenhouse conditions. Among them, a superior tolerant genotype 
(KC-2226) was chosen for transcriptomic analysis. Our result showed that 5007 
and 3489 genes were deferentially up- and downregulated, respectively. 
Upregulated genes were involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, 
and amino acid biosynthesis whereas downregulated genes were often engaged in 
DNA synthesis, replication, repair and topological changes. The result of 
protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that AT1G76550 (1.46), 
AT1G20950 (1.42), IAR4 (1.19), and PYD2 (1.16) among upregulated genes and THY-1 
(44), PCNA1 (41) and TOPII (22) among down-regulated genes had the highest 
interactions with other genes. In conclusion, Ae. tauschii employs elevated 
transcription of specific genes involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis and 
gluconeogenesis and amino acid biosynthesis pathways rather than genes active in 
DNA synthesis and repair to provide the energy needed for the plant to survive 
under stress conditions.

PURPOSE: The spatiotemporal trend of the burden of injury due to occupational 
accidents in Iran, 2011-2018 were assessed at the national and subnational 
levels.
METHODS: The burden of occupational injury was estimated using three datasets of 
occupational injury data, the employed population, and duration and disability 
weight of injuries.
RESULTS: The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), deaths, DALY rate, and 
death rate (per 100,000 workers) of occupational injury in Iran drastically 
decreased from 169,523, 2,280, 827, and 11 in 2011 to 86,235, 1,151, 362, and 5 
in 2018, respectively. The DALY rates of occupational injury were significantly 
different by gender and age in a manner that the DALY rate of men was much 
higher than that of women and the DALY rates by age group in 2018 ranged from 98 
for 50 y and over to 901 for 15-19 y. The shares of injury outcomes in the total 
DALYs in 2018 were as follows: 63.6% for fatal injuries, 17.4% for fracture, 
7.9% for open wound, 7.3% for amputation, and 3.8% for other injuries. Over 83% 
of the DALYs was observed in three economic activity groups of construction, 
manufacturing, and community, social, and personal service activities. The three 
provinces with the highest DALY rates in 2018 were Markazi, West Azarbaijan, and 
East Azarbaijan, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Despite the decreasing temporal trend, the burden of occupational 
injury in Iran in 2018 was high. The high-risk groups and hot spot provinces 
should be taken into more consideration for further reduction of the injury 
burden.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life-year instruments help comparison among 
programs by capturing their effects in terms of utility. Generic instruments are 
applicable to everyone, and for this reason, they are known to lack sensitivity 
when measuring gains in some domains. Specific instruments tend to fill this gap 
but, in domains like cancer, existing instruments are either 
nonpreferences-based or based on the general population's preferences.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study describes the development of a new value set 
for a well-known and highly used generic instrument, the Second Version of the 
Short Form 6-Dimension, to better consider the preferences of patients with 
cancer. In this aim, a hybrid approach combining the time trade-off and the 
discrete choice experiment was used. The population of interest was the Quebec 
population, Canada, with breast or colorectal cancer. Their preferences were 
elicited in 2 periods: before (T1) and 8 days after the beginning of a 
chemotherapy procedure (T2).
RESULTS: A total of 2808 observations for the time trade-off and 2520 
observations for the discrete choice experiment were used. The parsimonious 
model encompassing the 2 periods was the preferred model. The new value set 
allows a greater utility range than the EQ-5D-5L and the Second Version of the 
Short Form 6-Dimension reference value sets and helps in better considering 
patients experiencing severe health situations. A good correlation between these 
2 instruments and other specific cancer instruments (ie, European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, QLU-C10D, 
and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) was observed. Significative 
differences in utility values were also noted within periods and types of 
cancer.
