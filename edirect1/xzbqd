progress still escapes many patients, and the details that separate patients 
from ultimate cure. In this article, we review our current understanding of CML 
in 2015, present recommendations for optimal management, and discuss the 
unanswered questions and what could be done to answer them in the near future.

OBJECTIVE: We investigate the use of the Functional Capacity Index (FCI) as a 
tool for establishing vehicle safety priorities by comparing the life year 
burden of injuries to the burden of fatality in frontal and side automotive 
crashes. We demonstrate FCI's utility by investigating in detail the resulting 
disabling injuries and their life year costs.
METHODS: We selected occupants in the 2000-2013 NASS-CDS database involved in 
frontal and side crashes, merged their injuries with FCI, and then used the 
merged data to estimate each occupant's overall functional loss. Lifetime 
functional loss was assessed by combining this measure of impairment with the 
occupants' expected future life spans, estimated from the Social Security 
Administration's Actuarial Life Table.
RESULTS: Frontal crashes produce a large number of disabling injuries, 
particularly to the lower extremities. In our population, these crashes are 
estimated to account for approximately 400,000 life years lost to disability in 
comparison with 500,000 life years lost to fatality. Victims of side crashes 
experienced a higher rate of fatality but a significantly lower rate of 
disabling injury (0.3 vs. 1.0%), resulting in approximately 370,000 life years 
lost to fatality versus 50,000 life years lost to disability.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disabling injuries to car crash survivors should be 
considered when setting vehicle safety design priorities. In frontal crashes 
this burden in life years is similar to the burden attributable to fatality.

OBJECTIVE: To define risk thresholds for cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing 
salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) for ovarian cancer (OC) prevention in 
low/intermediate risk postmenopausal women.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model compares lifetime costs-&-effects of offering 
'RRSO' with 'no RRSO' to postmenopausal women ≥50years for different lifetime 
OC-risk thresholds: 2%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 8% and 10%. Well established data from the 
literature are used to estimate total costs, effects in terms of 
Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years(QALYs), cancer incidence, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) and impact. Costs are reported at 2012 prices; 
costs/outcomes discounted at 3.5%. Deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA) evaluate model uncertainty.
RESULTS: RRSO does not save QALYs and is not cost-effective at the 2% general 
population lifetime OC-risk. At 4% OC-risk RRSO saves QALYs but is not 
cost-effective. At risk thresholds ≥5%, RRSO saves more life-years and QALYs and 
is highly cost-effective. The ICERs for OC-risk levels 5%, 6%, 8% and 10% are 
£15,247, £9958, £4584, and £1864 respectively. The gain in life-years from RRSO 
equates to 29.2, 40.1, 62.1 and 80.3days at risk thresholds of 5%, 6%, 8% and 
10% respectively. The results are not sensitive to treatment costs of 
RRSO/OC/cardiovascular events but are sensitive to utility-scores for RRSO. On 
PSA, 67%, 80%, 84%, 91% and 94% of simulations at risk thresholds of 4%, 5%, 6%, 
8% and 10% respectively are cost-effective for RRSO.
CONCLUSION: RRSO is highly cost-effective in postmenopausal women aged >50 with 
≥5% lifetime OC-risk and increases life-expectancy by ≥29.2days. The results 
could have significant clinical implications given the improvements in risk 
prediction and falling costs of genotyping.

OBJECTIVES: Perceptions of future time are of key interest to aging research 
because of their implications for subjective well-being. Interestingly, 
perceptions about future time are only moderately associated with age when 
looking at the second half of life, pointing to a vast heterogeneity in future 
time perceptions among older adults. We examine associations between future time 
perceptions, age, and subjective well-being across two studies, including 
moderations by individual resources.
METHOD: Using data from the Berlin Aging Study (N = 516; Mage = 85 years), we 
link one operationalization (subjective nearness to death) and age to subjective 
well-being. Using Health and Retirement Study data (N = 2,596; Mage = 77 years), 
we examine associations of another future time perception indicator (subjective 
future life expectancy) and age with subjective well-being.
RESULTS: Consistent across studies, perceptions of limited time left were 
associated with poorer subjective well-being (lower life satisfaction and 
positive affect; more negative affect and depressive symptoms). Importantly, 
individual resources moderated future time perception-subjective well-being 
associations with those of better health exhibiting reduced future time 
perception-subjective well-being associations.
DISCUSSION: We discuss our findings in the context of the Model of Strength and 
Vulnerability Integration.

BACKGROUND: Advanced urothelial cancer (AUCa) is associated with poor long-term 
survival. Two major concerns are related to nonexposure to cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy and poor outcome after relapse. Our purpose was to record patterns 
of practice in AUCa in Greece, focusing on first-line treatment and management 
of relapsed disease.
METHODS: Patients with AUCa treated from 2011 to 2013 were included in the 
analysis. Fitness for cisplatin was assessed by recently established criteria.
RESULTS: Of 327 patients treated with first-line chemotherapy, 179 (55%) did not 
receive cisplatin. Criteria for unfitness for cisplatin were: Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≥ 2, 21%; creatinine 
clearance ≤ 60 mL/min, 55%; hearing impairment, 8%; neuropathy, 1%; and cardiac 
failure, 5%. Forty-six patients (27%) did not fulfill any criterion for 
unfitness for cisplatin. The main reasons for these deviations were 
comorbidities (28%) and advanced age (32%). Seventy-four (68%) of 109 patients 
who experienced a relapse received second-line chemotherapy. The most frequent 
reason for not offering second-line chemotherapy was poor PS or limited life 
expectancy (66%).
CONCLUSION: In line with international data, approximately 50% of Greek patients 
with AUCa do not receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy, although 27% of them were 
suitable for such treatment. In addition, about one third of patients with 
relapse did not receive second-line chemotherapy because of poor PS or short 
life expectancy. Enforcing criteria for fitness for cisplatin and earlier 
diagnosis of relapse represent 2 targets for improvement in current treatment 
practice for AUCa.

In Hainan Province, China, great achievements in elimination of falciparum 
malaria have been made since 2010. There have been no locally acquired 
falciparum malaria cases since that time. The cost-effectiveness of elimination 
of falciparum malaria has been analyzed in Hainan Province. There were 4,422 
falciparum malaria cases reported from 2002 to 2012, more cases occurred in 
males than in females. From 2002 to 2012, a total of 98.5 disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) were reported because of falciparum malaria. Populations in 
the age ranges of 15-25 and 30-44 years had higher incidences and DALYs than 
other age groups. From 2002 to 2012, malaria-related costs for salaries of 
staff, funds from the provincial government, national government, and the GFATM 
were US$3.02, US$2.24, US$1.44, and US$5.08 million, respectively. An estimated 
9,504 falciparum malaria cases were averted during the period 2003-2012. The 
estimated cost per falciparum malaria case averted was US$116.5. The falciparum 
malaria elimination program in Hainan was highly effective and successful. 
However, funding for maintenance is still needed because of imported cases.

PURPOSE: To determine how prognostic conversations influence perceptions of life 
expectancy (LE), distress, and the patient-physician relationship among patients 
with advanced cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study of 590 patients 
with metastatic solid malignancies with progressive disease after ≥ one line of 
palliative chemotherapy, undergoing follow-up to death. At baseline, patients 
were asked whether their oncologist had disclosed an estimate of prognosis. 
Patients also estimated their own LE and completed assessments of the 
patient-physician relationship, distress, advance directives, and end-of-life 
care preferences.
RESULTS: Among this cohort of 590 patients with advanced cancer (median 
survival, 5.4 months), 71% wanted to be told their LE, but only 17.6% recalled a 
prognostic disclosure by their physician. Among the 299 (51%) of 590 patients 
willing to estimate their LE, those who recalled prognostic disclosure offered 
more realistic estimates as compared with patients who did not (median, 12 
months; interquartile range, 6 to 36 months v 48 months; interquartile range, 12 
to 180 months; P < .001), and their estimates were less likely to differ from 
their actual survival by > 2 (30.2% v 49.2%; odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.14 
to 0.82) or 5 years (9.5% v 35.5%; OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.47). In adjusted 
analyses, recall of prognostic disclosure was associated with a 17.2-month 
decrease (95% CI, 6.2 to 28.2 months) in patients' LE self-estimates. Longer LE 
self-estimates were associated with lower likelihood of do-not-resuscitate order 
(adjusted OR, 0.439; 95% CI, 0.296 to 0.630 per 12-month increase in estimate) 
and preference for life-prolonging over comfort-oriented care (adjusted OR, 
1.493; 95% CI, 1.091 to 1.939). Prognostic disclosure was not associated with 
worse patient-physician relationship ratings, sadness, or anxiety in adjusted 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Prognostic disclosures are associated with more realistic patient 
expectations of LE, without decrements to their emotional well-being or the 
patient-physician relationship.

Willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year for life-saving treatments in 
Thailand.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) value for life-saving treatments and to determine factors affecting 
the WTP per QALY value.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey with multistage sampling and face-to-face 
interviews.
SETTING: General population in the southern part of Thailand.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 600 individuals were included in the study. Only 554 
(92.3%) responses were usable for data analyses.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Participants were asked for the maximum amount of WTP value for 
life-saving treatments by an open-ended question. EQ-5D-3L and visual analogue 
scale (VAS) were used to estimate additional QALY.
RESULTS: The amount of WTP values varied from 0 to 720,000 Baht/year 
(approximately 32 Baht=US$1). The averages of additional QALY obtained from VAS 
and EQ-5D-3L were only slightly different (0.872 and 0.853, respectively). The 
averages of WTP per QALY obtained from VAS and EQ-5D-3L were 244,720 and 243,120 
Baht/QALY, respectively. As compared to male participants, female participants 
were more likely to pay less for an additional QALY (p=0.007). In addition, 
participants with higher household incomes tended to have higher WTP per QALY 
values (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study added another WTP per QALY value specifically for 
life-saving treatments, which would complement the current cost-effectiveness 
threshold used in Thailand and optimise patient access to innovative treatments 
or technologies.

Water at Biological Phase Boundaries: Its Role in Interfacial Activation of 
Enzymes and Metabolic Pathways.

Drive, Madison, WI, 53706, USA. sdamodar@facstaff.wisc.edu.

Many life-sustaining activities in living cells occur at the membrane-water 
interface. The pertinent questions that we need to ask are, what are the 
evolutionary reasons in biology for choosing the membrane-water interface as the 
site for performing and/or controlling crucial biological reactions, and what is 
the key physical principle that is very singular to the membrane-water interface 
that biology exploits for regulating metabolic processes in cells? In this 
chapter, a hypothesis is developed, which espouses that cells control activities 
of membrane-bound enzymes through manipulation of the thermodynamic activity of 
water in the lipid-water interfacial region. The hypothesis is based on the fact 
that the surface pressure of a lipid monolayer is a direct measure of the 
thermodynamic activity of water at the lipid-water interface. Accordingly, the 
surface pressure-dependent activation or inactivation of interfacial enzymes is 
directly related to changes in the thermodynamic activity of interfacial water. 
Extension of this argument suggests that cells may manipulate conformations (and 
activities) of membrane-bound enzymes by manipulating the (re)activity of 
interfacial water at various locations in the membrane by localized compression 
or expansion of the interface. In this respect, cells may use the membrane-bound 
hormone receptors, lipid phase transition, and local variations in membrane 
lipid composition as effectors of local compression and/or expansion of 
membrane, and thereby local water activity. Several experimental data in the 
literature will be reexamined in the light of this hypothesis.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brief interventions promoting physical activity 
are cost-effective in primary care or community settings.
DESIGN: Systematic review of economic evaluations.
METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 
EconLit, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, the Cochrane library, National Health Service 
Economic Evaluation Database and the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry up to 
20 August 2014. Web of Knowledge was used for cross-reference search. We 
included studies investigating the cost-effectiveness of brief interventions, as 
defined by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, promoting physical 
activity in primary care or the community. Methodological quality was assessed 
using Drummond's checklist for economic evaluations. Data were extracted from 
individual studies fulfilling selection criteria using a standardised pro forma. 
Comparisons of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were made between 
studies.
RESULTS: Of 1840 identified publications, 13 studies fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria describing 14 brief interventions. Studies varied widely in the methods 
used, such as the perspective of economic analysis, intervention effects and 
outcome measures. The incremental cost of moving an inactive person to an active 
state, estimated for eight studies, ranged from £96 to £986. The cost-utility 
was estimated in nine studies compared with usual care and varied from £57 to 
£14 002 per quality-adjusted life year; dominant to £6500 per 
disability-adjusted life year; and £15 873 per life years gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief interventions promoting physical activity in primary care and 
the community are likely to be inexpensive compared with usual care. Given the 
commonly accepted thresholds, they appear to be cost-effective on the whole, 
although there is notable variation between studies.

BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials have shown the 9-valent human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to be highly effective against types 31/33/45/52/58 
compared with the 4-valent. Evidence on the added health and economic benefit of 
the 9-valent is required for policy decisions. We compare population-level 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 9- and 4-valent HPV vaccination in the 
United States.
METHODS: We used a multitype individual-based transmission-dynamic model of HPV 
infection and disease (anogenital warts and cervical, anogenital, and 
oropharyngeal cancers), 3% discount rate, and societal perspective. The model 
was calibrated to sexual behavior and epidemiologic data from the United States. 
In our base-case, we assumed 95% vaccine-type efficacy, lifelong protection, and 
a cost/dose of $145 and $158 for the 4- and 9-valent vaccine, respectively. 
Predictions are presented using the mean (80% uncertainty interval [UI] = 
10(th)-90(th) percentiles) of simulations.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, the 4-valent gender-neutral vaccination 
program is estimated to cost $5500 (80% UI = 2400-9400) and $7300 (80% UI = 
4300-11 000)/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with and without 
cross-protection, respectively. Switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral program 
is estimated to be cost-saving irrespective of cross-protection assumptions. 
Finally, the incremental cost/QALY gained of switching to a 9-valent 
gender-neutral program (vs 9-valent girls/4-valent boys) is estimated to be $140 
200 (80% UI = 4200->1 million) and $31 100 (80% UI = 2100->1 million) with and 
without cross-protection, respectively. Results are robust to assumptions about 
HPV natural history, screening methods, duration of protection, and healthcare 
costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral HPV vaccination program is 
likely to be cost-saving if the additional cost/dose of the 9-valent is less 
than $13. Giving females the 9-valent vaccine provides the majority of benefits 
of a gender-neutral strategy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the fourth leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths in the United States, and is projected to be second by 
2025. It has the worst survival rate among all major cancers. Two pressing needs 
for extending life expectancy of affected individuals are the development of new 
approaches to identify improved therapeutics, addressed herein, and the 
identification of early markers. PDA advances through a complex series of 
intercellular and physiological interactions that drive cancer progression in 
response to organ stress, organ failure, malnutrition, and infiltrating immune 
and stromal cells. Candidate drugs identified in organ culture or cell-based 
screens must be validated in preclinical models such as KIC 
(p48(Cre);LSL-Kras(G12D);Cdkn2a(f/f)) mice, a genetically engineered model of 
PDA in which large aggressive tumors develop by 4 weeks of age. We report a 
rapid, systematic and robust in vivo screen for effective drug combinations to 
treat Kras-dependent PDA. Kras mutations occur early in tumor progression in 
over 90% of human PDA cases. Protein kinase and G-protein coupled receptor 
(GPCR) signaling activates Kras. Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) 
proteins are coincidence detectors that can be induced by multiple inputs to 
feedback-regulate GPCR signaling. We crossed Rgs16::GFP bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice with KIC mice and show that the Rgs16::GFP 
transgene is a Kras(G12D)-dependent marker of all stages of PDA, and increases 
proportionally to tumor burden in KIC mice. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of 
cultured primary PDA cells reveals characteristics of embryonic progenitors of 
pancreatic ducts and endocrine cells, and extraordinarily high expression of the 
receptor tyrosine kinase Axl, an emerging cancer drug target. In 
proof-of-principle drug screens, we find that weanling KIC mice with PDA treated 
for 2 weeks with gemcitabine (with or without Abraxane) plus inhibitors of Axl 
signaling (warfarin and BGB324) have fewer tumor initiation sites and reduced 
tumor size compared with the standard-of-care treatment. Rgs16::GFP is therefore 
an in vivo reporter of PDA progression and sensitivity to new chemotherapeutic 
drug regimens such as Axl-targeted agents. This screening strategy can 
potentially be applied to identify improved therapeutics for other cancers.

Treatment of hepatitis C virus, the most common chronic viral infection in the 
United States, has historically suffered from challenges including serious side 
effects, low efficacy, and ongoing transmission and reinfection. Recent 
innovations have produced breakthrough therapies that are effective in more than 
90 percent of patients. These treatments could dramatically reduce the virus's 
prevalence but are costly. To quantify the benefit of these treatments to 
society, including the value of reduced transmission, we estimated the effects 
of several hepatitis C treatment strategies on cost and population health. 
Treating patients at all disease stages could generate $610-$1,221 billion in 
additional quality-adjusted life-years, plus an additional $139 billion in saved 
medical expenditures over fifty years, and minimize the disease burden, but 
up-front treatment costs would exceed $150 billion. An intermediate 
scenario--treating 5 percent of the infected population annually, regardless of 
patients' disease stages--would also return substantial benefits and would be 
much more affordable under current financing schemes.

The existence of important socioeconomic disparities in health and mortality is 
a well-established fact. Many pathways have been adduced to explain inequality 
in life spans. In this article we examine one factor that has been somewhat 
neglected: People with different levels of education get sorted into jobs with 
different degrees of exposure to workplace attributes that contribute to poor 
health. We used General Social Survey data to estimate differential exposures to 
workplace conditions, results from a meta-analysis that estimated the effect of 
workplace conditions on mortality, and a model that permitted us to estimate the 
overall effects of workplace practices on health. We conclude that 10-38 percent 
of the difference in life expectancy across demographic groups can be explained 
by the different job conditions their members experience.

AIM: The purpose of the present study was to correlate early hand function 
assessment during the first years of life with neuroimaging findings and the 
different patterns of cortico-motor reorganization in children with unilateral 
cerebral palsy (UCP).
METHODS: We conducted a long prospective observational study, in which 17 
children with UCP (8 left-sided hemiplegia; Manual Ability Classification System 
level 1-3) were first assessed at a mean age of 24 months (range 18-28), and 
followed up by means of the Besta Scale, a new standardized protocol assessing 
both unimanual and bimanual hand function. They also underwent Melbourne 
Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL) and single-pulse 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) at a mean age of 10 years 5 months 
(range 9 y 1 m-12 y 8 m). Brain MRIs of all the 17 children were independently 
assessed and scored by two blinded observers, according to a defined protocol. 
Possible correlations between hand function at first assessment, neuroimaging 
and TMS data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Early hand function impairment significantly correlated with the 
extension of brain damage (ρ = -0.531, p = 0.028), number of involved areas 
(ρ = -0.608, p = 0.010), presence of radiological signs of cortico-spinal 
degeneration (ρ = -0.628, p = 0.007), and basal ganglia involvement (ρ = -0.485, 
p = 0.049). Additionally, higher hand function scores (i.e. better hand 
function) at first assessment significantly correlated with contralateral 
cortico-spinal projections, while lower scores significantly correlated with 
either mixed or ipsilateral cortico-spinal projections to the affected hand 
(χ(2)(2) = 11.418, p = 0.003; post-hoc tests: contralateral TMS group versus 
ipsilateral: Z = -2.943, p = 0.002 and contralateral TMS group versus mixed: 
Z = -2.775, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study correlating hand function 
assessment in the first years of life, and its evolution over time, with 
neuroimaging and cortico-spinal projection patterns in children with UCP. These 
findings could contribute to an improved prediction of prognosis and a better 
delineation of therapeutic interventions in young children with UCP.

BACKGROUND: In recent decades demographic changes (low fertility rates, 
increased life expectancy…) in most OECD countries, have brought profound 
changes in the population pyramid, with several effects in the welfare of 
society. One of them is the increase in the number of people with disabilities, 
since age is a determining factor in the emergence of this dependency.
OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This paper studies the probability to enter and transit in 
and from a disability state, as well as its associated mortality, by attending 
to the distinction between the initial disability level and the process that 
leads on from it, and by addressing whether and how education, age and income 
affect this transition.
METHODS: Applying a Markov model and a survival analysis to new Spanish 
administrative data set (Muestra Continua de Vida Laboral (MCVL)) we estimate 
the probability that a person changes the state of disability and the duration 
of her progression in each case.
RESULTS: We find that people with an initial state of disability have a higher 
propensity to change status and take less time to transit amongst different 
stages than those who have no disability. Men do so more frequently than women 
and income have negative effects on the transition.
CONCLUSIONS: These results may help to incorporate into welfare programs some 
protection mechanisms for delaying transitions and target the most fragile 
population groups.

Many methods have been reported and used to include recycling in life cycle 
assessments (LCAs). This paper evaluates six widely used methods: three 
substitution methods (i.e. substitution based on equal quality, a correction 
factor, and alternative material), allocation based on the number of recycling 
loops, the recycled-content method, and the equal-share method. These six 
methods were first compared, with an assumed hypothetical 100% recycling rate, 
for an aluminium can and a disposable polystyrene (PS) cup. The substitution and 
recycled-content method were next applied with actual rates for recycling, 
incineration and landfilling for both product systems in selected countries. The 
six methods differ in their approaches to credit recycling. The three 
substitution methods stimulate the recyclability of the product and assign 
credits for the obtained recycled material. The choice to either apply a 
correction factor, or to account for alternative substituted material has a 
considerable influence on the LCA results, and is debatable. Nevertheless, we 
prefer incorporating quality reduction of the recycled material by either a 
correction factor or an alternative substituted material over simply ignoring 
quality loss. The allocation-on-number-of-recycling-loops method focusses on the 
life expectancy of material itself, rather than on a specific separate product. 
The recycled-content method stimulates the use of recycled material, i.e. 
credits the use of recycled material in products and ignores the recyclability 
of the products. The equal-share method is a compromise between the substitution 
methods and the recycled-content method. The results for the aluminium can 
follow the underlying philosophies of the methods. The results for the PS cup 
are additionally influenced by the correction factor or credits for the 
alternative material accounting for the drop in PS quality, the waste treatment 
management (recycling rate, incineration rate, landfilling rate), and the source 
of avoided electricity in case of waste incineration. The results for the PS 
cup, which are less dominated by production of virgin material than aluminium 
can, furthermore depend on the environmental impact categories. This stresses 
the importance to consider other impact categories besides the most commonly 
used global warming impact. The multitude of available methods complicates the 
choice of an appropriate method for the LCA practitioner. New guidelines keep 
appearing and industries also suggest their own preferred method. Unambiguous 
ISO guidelines, particularly related to sensitivity analysis, would be a great 
step forward in making more robust LCAs.

BACKGROUND: Hypercalcaemia is a potentially fatal paraneoplastic complication of 
malignancy. It primarily manifests during the advanced phase of cancer, with the 
life expectancy of patients ranging from weeks to months. The mainstay of 
treatment is with bisphosphonates, but these are not frequently used in a 
palliative population due to potential conflict with goals of care.
GOAL: The goals of this study was to determine the reversibility of 
hypercalcaemia amongst patients whose underlying malignancy is not being treated 
and assess whether correction results in improvement in symptoms attributable to 
hypercalcaemia, while identifying risk factors that can predict responsiveness.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 63 patients aged >18 years 
who were admitted to the St Joseph's Palliative Care Unit, Australia between 
2007 and 2013, having evidence of malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia which was 
treated with bisphosphonates. We assessed the response to bisphosphonates based 
on improvement of symptoms attributable to hypercalcaemia, as well as a 
reduction in serum calcium. We used the Kaplan-Meier survival method and 
parametric survival analysis to estimate the effect of the independent variables 
on time till death.
RESULTS: Thirty-six of sixty three patients achieved normocalcaemia following 
treatment with an intravenous bisphosphonate. Complete response was influenced 
by the number of instances of hypercalcaemia in the past and patient factors, 
such as age and albumin levels. We found that a reduction in calcium level was 
associated with a significantly prolonged survival, as well as symptomatic 
improvement, irrespective of whether normocalcaemia was achieved.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that bisphosphonates can be recommended as a 
palliative measure for selected patients to improve symptoms and prolong 
survival.

Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a regulatory peptide with potent pharmacological 
effects. In rodents, NPS is expressed in a few pontine cell clusters. Its 
receptor (NPSR1) is, however, widely distributed in the brain. The anxiolytic 
and arousal-promoting effects of NPS make the NPS-NPSR1 system an interesting 
potential drug target in mood-related disorders. However, so far possible 
disease-related mechanisms involving NPS have only been studied in rodents. To 
validate the relevance of these animal studies for i.a. drug development, we 
have explored the distribution of NPS-expressing neurons in the human pons using 
in situ hybridization and stereological methods and we compared the distribution 
of NPS mRNA expressing neurons in the human and rat brain. The calculation 
revealed a total number of 22,317 ± 2411 NPS mRNA-positive neurons in human, 
bilaterally. The majority of cells (84%) were located in the parabrachial area 
in human: in the extension of the medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, in the 
Kölliker-Fuse nucleus and around the adjacent lateral lemniscus. In human, in 
sharp contrast to the rodents, only very few NPS-positive cells (5%) were found 
close to the locus coeruleus. In addition, we identified a smaller cell cluster 
(11% of all NPS cells) in the pontine central gray matter both in human and rat, 
which has not been described previously even in rodents. We also examined the 
distribution of NPSR1 mRNA-expressing neurons in the human pons. These cells 
were mainly located in the rostral laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, the cuneiform 
nucleus, the microcellular tegmental nucleus region and in the periaqueductal 
gray. Our results show that both NPS and NPSR1 in the human pons are 
preferentially localized in regions of importance for integration of visceral 
autonomic information and emotional behavior. The reported interspecies 
differences must, however, be considered when looking for targets for new 
pharmacotherapeutical interventions.

[Treatment of acute coronary syndrome in older adults and high-risk 
patients."When the going gets tough…"].

[Article in Italian]

Bassanelli G, Morici N, De Luca L, De Servi S, Savonitto S.

The increasing life expectancy in older adults and the better survival of 
patients with multiple pathologies require the capability to treat complex 
clinical conditions with an increased risk of iatrogenic complications. 
Nevertheless, recent improvements in the pharmacological and interventional 
treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have promoted a shift from 
therapeutic nihilism to a more active management of complex ACS cases. Despite 
the paucity of specific randomized clinical trials, observational studies seem 
to show benefit of an early invasive treatment in these patients. This approach 
requires close cooperation of clinical intensivists, interventional 
cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons either in a specialized heart center 
or in a network of hospitals.
