performed on sinus rhythm (SR) restoration, survival, QoL and 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: In a multicentre, Phase III, pragmatic, double-blinded, parallel-armed 
randomized controlled trial, 352 cardiac surgery patients with >3 months of 
documented AF were randomized to surgery with or without adjunct maze or similar 
AF ablation between 2009 and 2014. Primary outcomes were SR restoration at 
1 year and quality-adjusted life years at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included 
SR at 2 years, overall and stroke-free survival, medication, QoL, 
cost-effectiveness and safety.
RESULTS: More ablation patients were in SR at 1 year [odds ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.20-3.54; P = 0.009]. At 2 years, the OR increased to 
3.24 (95% CI 1.76-5.96). Quality-adjusted life years were similar at 2 years 
(ablation - control -0.025, P = 0.6319). Significantly fewer ablation patients 
were anticoagulated from 6 months postoperatively. Stroke rates were 5.7% 
(ablation) and 9.1% (control) (P = 0.3083). There was no significant difference 
in stroke-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99, 95% CI 0.64-1.53; P = 0.949] 
nor in serious adverse events, operative or overall survival, cardioversion, 
pacemaker implantation, New York Heart Association, EQ-5D-3L and SF-36. The mean 
additional ablation cost per patient was £3533 (95% CI £1321-£5746). 
Cost-effectiveness was not demonstrated at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct AF surgery is safe and increases SR restoration and costs 
but not survival or QoL up to 2 years. A continued follow-up will provide 
information on these outcomes in the longer term.

Methods for the economic evaluation of changes to the organisation and delivery 
of health services: principal challenges and recommendations.

Economics,The University of Manchester,Manchester,UK.

There is a requirement for economic evaluation of health technologies seeking 
public funding across Europe. Changes to the organisation and delivery of health 
services, including changes to health policy, are not covered by such 
appraisals. These changes also have consequences for National Health Service 
(NHS) funds, yet undergo no mandatory cost-effectiveness assessment. The focus 
on health technologies may have occurred because larger-scale service changes 
pose more complex challenges to evaluators. This paper discusses the principal 
challenges faced when performing economic evaluations of changes to the 
organisation and delivery of health services and provides recommendations for 
overcoming them. The five principal challenges identified are as follows: 
undertaking ex-ante evaluation; evaluating impacts in terms of quality-adjusted 
life years; assessing costs and opportunity costs; accounting for spillover 
effects; and generalisability. Of these challenges, methods for estimating the 
impact on costs and quality-adjusted life years are those most in need of 
development. Methods are available for ex-ante evaluation, assessing opportunity 
costs and examining generalisability. However, these are rarely applied in 
practice. The general principles of assessing the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions should be applied to all NHS spending, not just that involving 
health technologies. Advancements in this area have the potential to improve the 
allocation of scarce NHS resources.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for thalassemia 
major (TM), which inflicts a significant 1-time cost. Hence, it is important to 
explore the cost effectiveness of HSCT versus lifelong regular 
transfusion-chelation (TC) therapy. This study was undertaken to estimate 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with the 
intervention group HSCT, and the comparator group TC, in TM patients. A 
combination of decision tree and Markov model was used for analysis. A hospital 
database, supplemented with a review of published literature, was used to derive 
input parameters for the model. A lifetime study horizon was used and future 
costs and consequences were discounted at 3%. Results are presented using 
societal perspective. Incremental cost per QALY gained with use of HSCT as 
compared with TC was 64,096 (US$986) in case of matched related donor (MRD) and 
1,67,657 (US$2579) in case of a matched unrelated donor transplantation. The 
probability of MRD transplant to be cost effective at the willingness to pay 
threshold of Indian per capita gross domestic product is 94%. HSCT is a 
long-term value for money intervention that is highly cost effective and its 
long-term clinical and economic benefits outweigh those of TC.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogeneous, debilitating 
condition with highly relevant impact on functional capacity, quality of life, 
and life-expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide long-term data on the Portuguese PH 
population, by characterising the clinical presentation, evolution, and outcomes 
of PH patients in a specialised referral centre.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of 101 patients with pre-capillary 
PH (pcPH) referenced to an expert tertiary care referral centre in northern 
Portugal from 2002 to 2013. Diagnosis was confirmed by right heart 
catheterisation (RHC). PH classification followed consensus criteria from the 
5th World Symposium in Nice, 2013.
RESULTS: The most frequent causes of pcPH were Group 1 PH - pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) (54.4%) and Group 4 PH - Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary 
hypertension (CTEPH) (25.7%); importantly, 17.8% of patients presented PH 
associated with multiple aetiologies. Targeted therapy was used in 91.1% of 
patients (48.5% combination therapy). 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was estimated 
at 86.6%, 76.7%, and 64.1%, respectively. Survival was significantly better for 
those ≤40 years old (10.5 vs. 6.4 years; P=0.003) and for women with I/HPAH (9.3 
vs. 4.5 years; P=0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides long-term, real-world data for the management 
of PAH and CTEPH in Portugal and demonstrates the importance of dedicated 
electronic medical records and well defined clinical management protocols for 
better patient outcomes. Patients presented mostly with intermediate or high 
risk of mortality, which suggests delayed diagnosis and highlights the need to 
increase awareness among clinicians.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is a lack of studies describing the epidemiology of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients aged 75 years and older (elderly). Current 
guidelines recommend against routine screening colonoscopies in this population. 
We sought to describe the epidemiology of CRC in the elderly, utilizing a large, 
population-based database as this may impact screening guidelines in this 
population.
METHODS: Utilizing a commercial database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH), we 
identified a cohort of patients with a first-ever diagnosis of CRC between 2012 
and 2017 based on the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms. We 
calculated the rate of first-ever CRC occurrence in the elderly, described age, 
race, and gender-based rates of new CRC diagnoses, and identified associated 
conditions for new CRC in the elderly.
RESULTS: The rate of first-ever CRC in the elderly (aged 75 and above) was 
102.6/100,000 persons. The rate of new CRC was higher in males than females and 
in African Americans than Caucasians and Asians. There was a higher prevalence 
of right than left colon cancer. The rate of new CRC was higher in elderly with 
certain comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: The rate of new CRC diagnosis in the elderly was substantially 
greater compared to the overall population. Screening would be justified 
especially if a patient's life expectancy warrants it particularly if the 
patient has specific associated conditions that increase the risk for CRC.

BACKGROUND: Low-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary 
substantially across different national guidelines. To define thresholds 
associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, 
we studied individual-participant data from 599 912 current drinkers without 
previous cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: We did a combined analysis of individual-participant data from three 
large-scale data sources in 19 high-income countries (the Emerging Risk Factors 
Collaboration, EPIC-CVD, and the UK Biobank). We characterised dose-response 
associations and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) per 100 g per week of alcohol 
(12·5 units per week) across 83 prospective studies, adjusting at least for 
study or centre, age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. To be eligible for the 
analysis, participants had to have information recorded about their alcohol 
consumption amount and status (ie, non-drinker vs current drinker), plus age, 
sex, history of diabetes and smoking status, at least 1 year of follow-up after 
baseline, and no baseline history of cardiovascular disease. The main analyses 
focused on current drinkers, whose baseline alcohol consumption was categorised 
into eight predefined groups according to the amount in grams consumed per week. 
We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, total 
cardiovascular disease, and several cardiovascular disease subtypes. We 
corrected HRs for estimated long-term variability in alcohol consumption using 
152 640 serial alcohol assessments obtained some years apart (median interval 
5·6 years [5th-95th percentile 1·04-13·5]) from 71 011 participants from 37 
studies.
FINDINGS: In the 599 912 current drinkers included in the analysis, we recorded 
40 310 deaths and 39 018 incident cardiovascular disease events during 5·4 
million person-years of follow-up. For all-cause mortality, we recorded a 
positive and curvilinear association with the level of alcohol consumption, with 
the minimum mortality risk around or below 100 g per week. Alcohol consumption 
was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR per 100 g per 
week higher consumption 1·14, 95% CI, 1·10-1·17), coronary disease excluding 
myocardial infarction (1·06, 1·00-1·11), heart failure (1·09, 1·03-1·15), fatal 
hypertensive disease (1·24, 1·15-1·33); and fatal aortic aneurysm (1·15, 
1·03-1·28). By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was log-linearly 
associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0·94, 0·91-0·97). In 
comparison to those who reported drinking >0-≤100 g per week, those who reported 
drinking >100-≤200 g per week, >200-≤350 g per week, or >350 g per week had 
lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1-2 years, or 
4-5 years, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries, the 
threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g/week. For 
cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no 
clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being 
associated with lower disease risk. These data support limits for alcohol 
consumption that are lower than those recommended in most current guidelines.

[Living longer than expected: admitted to a hospice with an underestimated life 
expectancy].

In the Netherlands, patients who have a life expectancy of less than three 
months may be admitted to a hospice. In a small number of patients, however, 
their life expectancy is underestimated. It is assumed that patients are 
delighted to have this extra time. We present the cases of three patients 
admitted to a large Dutch hospice: two females aged 82 and 83 years, and a 
49-year-old man -who ended up living (significantly) longer than expected. Their 
cases make clear that patients in this situation may suffer from psychological, 
psychosocial, and existential distress. We argue that it is important that 
patients and their relatives are informed about their life expectancy, but that 
uncertainty in the estimation of said expectancy should be emphasized.

Social determinants of health are nonmedical factors that can affect a person's 
overall health and health outcomes. Where a person is born and the social 
conditions they are born into can affect their risk factors for premature death 
and their life expectancy. In this position paper, the American College of 
Physicians acknowledges the role of social determinants in health, examines the 
complexities associated with them, and offers recommendations on better 
integration of social determinants into the health care system while 
highlighting the need to address systemic issues hindering health equity.

BACKGROUND: There are numerous computational tools for taxonomic or functional 
analysis of microbiome samples, optimized to run on hundreds of millions of 
short, high quality sequencing reads. Programs such as MEGAN allow the user to 
interactively navigate these large datasets. Long read sequencing technologies 
continue to improve and produce increasing numbers of longer reads (of varying 
lengths in the range of 10k-1M bps, say), but of low quality. There is an 
increasing interest in using long reads in microbiome sequencing, and there is a 
need to adapt short read tools to long read datasets.
METHODS: We describe a new LCA-based algorithm for taxonomic binning, and an 
interval-tree based algorithm for functional binning, that are explicitly 
designed for long reads and assembled contigs. We provide a new interactive tool 
for investigating the alignment of long reads against reference sequences. For 
taxonomic and functional binning, we propose to use LAST to compare long reads 
against the NCBI-nr protein reference database so as to obtain frame-shift aware 
alignments, and then to process the results using our new methods.
RESULTS: All presented methods are implemented in the open source edition of 
MEGAN, and we refer to this new extension as MEGAN-LR (MEGAN long read). We 
evaluate the LAST+MEGAN-LR approach in a simulation study, and on a number of 
mock community datasets consisting of Nanopore reads, PacBio reads and assembled 
PacBio reads. We also illustrate the practical application on a Nanopore dataset 
that we sequenced from an anammox bio-rector community.
REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Nicola Segata together with Moreno 
Zolfo, Pete James Lockhart and Serghei Mangul.
CONCLUSION: This work extends the applicability of the widely-used metagenomic 
analysis software MEGAN to long reads. Our study suggests that the presented 
LAST+MEGAN-LR pipeline is sufficiently fast and accurate.

A retrospective study was performed to determine the efficacy of a tethering 
procedure developed to achieve a more rigid fixation and more reliable outcome 
in patients with refractory dislocation of the temporomandibular joint. The 
cases of eight patients with dementia and systemic diseases who underwent this 
technique were reviewed. In these eight patients, the condyles of 13 joints were 
ligated using wire between screws placed in the eminence and condylar head. 
Additional screw-wire ligations were applied to reinforce the restraint of 
movement in five of the 13 joints with suspected uncontrolled dislocation. The 
procedure was performed successfully, and the patients were followed-up for an 
average of 25months. In one patient, dislocation recurred 1year postoperatively 
due to wire breakage. The five joints in which a double set of screw-wire 
tethering was applied showed no recurrence or wire disturbance. This technique 
may, therefore, have short-term efficacy in cases that are refractory to 
standard procedures, although the material used for ligation should be 
investigated further. This approach can contribute to the quality of life of 
patients, particularly those with a short life-expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) 
in hospitalized children and adolescents has been increasing year-on-year. 
Paediatric CDAD places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. 
Probiotics are live organisms thought to improve the microbial balance of the 
host, counteract disturbances in intestinal flora, and reduce the risk of 
colonization by pathogenic bacteria.
AIM: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the economy of 
probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in children and adolescents receiving 
antibiotics.
METHODS: A decision tree model combining clinical effectiveness, utility and 
cost data was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the 
robustness of the model outcomes.
FINDING: The 'oral probiotics' strategy and 'no probiotics' strategy offered 
patients 0.05876 and 0.056 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of 
$16,668.70 and $20,355.28, respectively. The oral probiotics strategy exhibited 
higher QALY and lower cost, and represents the cost-saving strategy. The results 
were robust for sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the medical system, oral probiotics as a 
preventive strategy for CDAD in hospitalized children and adolescents receiving 
a therapeutic course of antibiotics reduced the risk of CDAD and represents a 
cost-saving strategy.

Cell adhesive biomaterials have been used for various cells in culture, 
especially for primary cultures of neurons. Here we examined laminin-111 and its 
active peptides conjugated to chitosan matrices (ChtMs) for primary culture of 
rat cortical neurons. Laminin-111 on poly-d-lysine substrate promoted neuronal 
cell attachment and differentiation. The biological activity of six active 
laminin-111-derived peptides was examined using a peptide-ChtM construct. When 
the syndecan-binding peptides, AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT, mouse laminin α1 chain 
2719-2730) and C16 (KAFDITYVRLKF, laminin γ1 chain 139-150), were conjugated to 
chitosan, AG73-ChtM and C16-ChtM showed potent neuronal cell attachment activity 
and promoted axon extension by primary cultured rat cortical neurons. However, 
the remaining peptides, including integrin-binding peptides, did not show 
activity when conjugated to ChtM. AG73-ChtM and C16-ChtM also supported neuron 
survival for at least 4 weeks in serum-free medium without a glia feeder layer. 
These data suggest that AG73-ChtM and C16-ChtM are useful for primary cultures 
of central nervous system neurons and have a potential for use as functional 
biomaterials for tissue engineering in the central nervous system.

OBJECTIVE: Quality improvement (QI) interventions can improve glycemic control, 
but little is known about their value. We systematically reviewed economic 
evaluations of QI interventions for glycemic control among adults with type 1 or 
type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used English-language studies from high-income 
countries that evaluated organizational changes and reported program and 
utilization-related costs, chosen from PubMed, EconLit, Centre for Reviews and 
Dissemination, New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Report, and 
WorldCat (January 2004 to August 2016). We extracted data regarding 
intervention, study design, change in HbA1c, time horizon, perspective, 
incremental net cost (studies lasting ≤3 years), incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) (studies lasting ≥20 years), and study quality. Weighted 
least-squares regression analysis was used to estimate mean changes in HbA1c and 
incremental net cost.
RESULTS: Of 3,646 records, 46 unique studies were eligible. Across 19 randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), HbA1c declined by 0.26% (95% CI 0.17-0.35) or 3 
mmol/mol (2 to 4) relative to usual care. In 8 RCTs lasting ≤3 years, 
incremental net costs were $116 (95% CI -$612 to $843) per patient annually. 
Long-term ICERs were $100,000-$115,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in 3 
RCTs, $50,000-$99,999/QALY in 1 RCT, $0-$49,999/QALY in 4 RCTs, and dominant in 
1 RCT. Results were more favorable in non-RCTs. Our limitations include the fact 
that the studies had diverse designs and involved moderate risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverse multifaceted QI interventions that lower HbA1c appear to be 
a fair-to-good value relative to usual care, depending on society's willingness 
to pay for improvements in health.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy in the 
treatment of patients with non-specific neck pain and low back pain.
DESIGN: Systematic review of economic evaluations.
DATA SOURCES: The search was performed in 5 clinical and 3 economic electronic 
databases.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included economic evaluations 
performed alongside randomised controlled trials. Differences in costs and 
effects were pooled in a meta-analysis, if possible, and incremental 
cost-utility ratios (ICUR) were descriptively analysed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. On average, exercise therapy was 
associated with lower costs and larger effects for quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) in comparison with usual care for subacute and chronic low back pain from 
a healthcare perspective (based on ICUR). Exercise therapy had similar costs and 
effect for QALY in comparison with other interventions for neck pain from a 
societal perspective, and subacute and chronic low back pain from a healthcare 
perspective. There was limited or inconsistent evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy compared with usual care for neck pain 
and acute low back pain, other interventions for acute low back pain and 
different types of exercise therapy for neck pain and low back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise therapy seems to be cost-effective compared with usual 
care for subacute and chronic low back pain. Exercise therapy was not (more) 
cost-effective compared with other interventions for neck pain and low back 
pain. The cost-utility estimates are rather uncertain, indicating that more 
economic evaluations are needed.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to explore the different sleep 
disorders associated with MSA, their mechanisms, and their treatments.
RECENT FINDINGS: Stridor is a red flag for the diagnosis of MSA. Recent findings 
show that its presence in early stage of the disease is associated with a 
reduction in life expectancy. Its management should be fast and adapted. Its 
treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or tracheostomy is 
efficacious. Sleep disorders in MSA are frequent and severe combining insomnia, 
daytime sleepiness, restless legs syndrome (RLS), REM sleep behavior disorder 
(RBD), and sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Sleep recordings confirm these 
disorders. Mechanisms involved in these disorders are complex associating (a) 
lesions of the pathways regulating sleep and wake or mood but also controlling 
movement, (b) iatrogenic effects of the treatments, and (3) consequences of the 
motor or dysautonomic symptoms. RBD prevalence is very high at the beginning of 
the motor symptoms but then seems to disappear.

Electronic address: cohnx001@umn.edu.

Clinical research aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease has focused on the 
effect of interventions to reduce risk factors on the incidence of future morbid 
events. Disease progression, which likely serves as a necessary prerequisite for 
morbid events, has not served as a target for therapy. The Rasmussen Center at 
the University of Minnesota has, for the past 18 years, been performing a 
noninvasive cardiovascular evaluation in individuals with no history of 
cardiovascular disease. The studies, performed in 1 hour in one room, provide a 
comprehensive noninvasive assessment of the severity of functional and 
structural abnormalities in the small arteries, the large arteries and the left 
ventricle, the target organs for most cardiovascular morbid events. Preliminary 
follow-up data have revealed a striking relationship between the Disease Score, 
which represents the sum of the abnormal tests, and the risk of future morbid 
events. In order to develop strategies to prolong cardiovascular disease-free 
life expectancy, studies in early stages of disease aimed at slowing disease 
progression should be encouraged.

Diabetes and cancer are worldwide chronic diseases with a major impact on the 
quality and expectancy of life. Metabolic abnormalities observed during the 
onset and progression of diabetes may have a critical role on the initiation and 
progression of carcinogenesis. To date, there are no conclusive data on the 
mechanisms underlying the relationship between diabetes and any type of human 
cancer. However, recent evidence suggests that both hyperglycemia and 
hyperinsulinemia in diabetes could elicit cell damage responses, such as 
glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and oxidative stress, which participate in the cell 
transformation process raising the risk of cancer development. In addition, 
clinical trials have revealed that several anti-diabetes therapies may 
potentially affect the risk of cancer though largely undefined mechanisms. In 
this review, we highlight epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of 
diabetes, which may influence cancer initiation and progression.
