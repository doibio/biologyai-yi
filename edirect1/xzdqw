anteflexion, and external rotation of the shoulder, and flexion and extension of 
the elbow. The EQ-US, and pronation and supination showed superior results for 
the operative group until six weeks follow-up. Malalignment occurred only in the 
nonoperative group (N = 14; 9.7%). In 19 patients with implant-related 
complications (N = 26; 10.6%) the implant was exchanged or removed. Nonunion 
occurred more often in the nonoperative group (26.3% versus 10.10% in the 
operative group; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Primary osteosynthesis of a humeral shaft fracture (AO type 12A and 
12B) in adults is safe and superior to nonoperative treatment, and should 
therefore be the treatment of choice. It is associated with a more than twofold 
reduced risk of nonunion, earlier functional recovery and a better range of 
motion of the shoulder and elbow joint than nonoperative treatment. Even after 
including the implant-related complications, the overall rate of complications 
as well as secondary surgical interventions was highest in the nonoperative 
group.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent, disabling 
disease requiring chronic management that is associated with an enormous 
individual and societal burden. This systematic review provides a global 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of pharmacological therapy for the management of 
OA.
METHODS: Following Center for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance, a 
literature search strategy was undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane 
Library, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, and National Health 
Service Economic Evaluation database (NHS EED) to identify original articles 
containing cost-effectiveness evaluation of OA pharmacological treatment 
published before 4 November 2021. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent 
reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist 
for economic evaluations. The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) 
instrument was used to assess the reporting quality of included articles.
RESULTS: Database searches identified 43 cost-effectiveness analysis studies 
(CEAs) on pharmacological management of OA that were conducted in 18 countries 
and four continents, with one study containing multiple continents. A total of 
four classes of drugs were assessed, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, symptomatic slow-acting drugs for 
osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs), and intra-articular (IA) injections. The 
methodological approaches of these studies showed substantial heterogeneity. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) were (in 2021 US dollars) US$44.40 to US$307,013.56 for NSAIDS, 
US$11,984.84 to US$128,028.74 for opioids, US$10,930.17 to US$27,799.73 for 
SYSADOAs, and US$258.36 to US$58,447.97 for IA injections in different 
continents. The key drivers of cost effectiveness included medical resources, 
productivity, relative risks, and selected comparators.
CONCLUSION: This review showed substantial heterogeneity among studies, ranging 
from a finding of dominance to very high ICERs, but most studies found 
interventions to be cost effective based on specific ICER thresholds. Important 
challenges in the analysis were related to the standardization and 
methodological quality of studies, as well as the presentation of results.

Insects change their stimulus-response through the perception of associating 
these stimuli with important survival events such as rewards, threats, and 
mates. Insects develop strong associations and relate them to their experiences 
through several behavioral procedures. Among the insects, Apis species, Apis 
mellifera ligustica are known for their outstanding ability to learn with 
tremendous economic importance. Apis mellifera ligustica has a strong cognitive 
ability and promising model species for investigating the neurobiological basis 
of remarkable olfactory learning abilities. Here we evaluated the olfactory 
learning ability of A. mellifera by using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) 
protocol. The brains of the learner and failed-learner bees were examined for 
comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to explain the difference in the 
learning capacity. In this study, we used an appetitive olfactory learning 
paradigm in the same age of A. mellifera bees to examine the differential gene 
expression in the brain of the learner and failed-learner. Bees that respond in 
2nd and 3rd trials or only responded to 3rd trials were defined as learned bees, 
failed-learner individuals were those bees that did not respond in all learning 
trials The results indicate that the learning ability of learner bees was 
significantly higher than failed-learner bees for 12 days. We obtained 
approximately 46.7 and 46.4 million clean reads from the learner bees 
failed-learner bees, respectively. Gene expression profile between learners' 
bees and failed-learners bees identified 74 differentially expressed genes, 57 
genes up-regulated in the brains of learners and 17 genes were down-regulated in 
the brains of the bees that fail to learn. The qRT-PCR validated the differently 
expressed genes. Transcriptome analyses revealed that specific genes in learner 
and failed-learner bees either down-regulated or up-regulated play a crucial 
role in brain development and learning behavior. Our finding suggests that 
down-regulated genes of the brain involved in the integumentary system, storage 
proteins, brain development, sensory processing, and neurodegenerative disorder 
may result in reduced olfactory discrimination and olfactory sensitivity in 
failed-learner bees. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of 
the olfactory learning behavior and gene expression information, which opens the 
door for understanding of the molecular mechanism of olfactory learning behavior 
in honeybees.

Indicators based a fixed "old" age threshold have been widely used for assessing 
socioeconomic disparities in mortality at older ages. Interpretation of 
long-term trends and determinants of these indicators is challenging because 
mortality above a fixed age that in the past would have reflected old age deaths 
is today mixing premature and old-age mortality. We propose the modal (i.e., 
most frequent) age at death, M, an indicator increasingly recognized in aging 
research, but which has been infrequently used for monitoring mortality 
disparities at older ages. We use mortality and population exposure data by 
occupational class over the 1971-2017 period from Finnish register data. The 
modal age and life expectancy indicators are estimated from mortality rates 
smoothed with penalized B-splines. Over the 1971-2017 period, occupational class 
disparities in life expectancy at 65 and 75 widened while disparities in M 
remained relatively stable. The proportion of the group surviving to the modal 
age was constant across time and occupational class. In contrast, the proportion 
surviving to age 65 and 75 has roughly doubled since 1971 and showed strong 
occupational class differences. Increasing socioeconomic disparities in 
mortality based on fixed old age thresholds may be a feature of changing 
selection dynamics in a context of overall declining mortality. Unlike life 
expectancy at a selected fixed old age, M compares individuals with similar 
survival chances over time and across occupational classes. This property makes 
trends and differentials in M easier to interpret in countries where old-age 
survival has improved significantly.

Many animals detect other individuals effortlessly. In Drosophila, previous 
studies have examined sensory processing during social interactions using simple 
blobs as visual stimulation; however, whether and how flies extract higher-order 
features from conspecifics to guide behavior remains elusive. Arguing that this 
should be reflected in sensorimotor relations, we developed unbiased machine 
learning tools for natural behavior quantification and applied these tools, 
which may prove broadly useful, to study interacting pairs. By transforming 
motor patterns with female-centered reference frames, we established circling, 
where heading and traveling directions intersect, as a unique pattern of social 
interaction during courtship. We found circling to be highly visual, with males 
exhibiting view-tuned motor patterns. Interestingly, males select specific wing 
and leg actions based on the positions and motions of the females' heads and 
tails. Using system identification, we derived visuomotor transformation 
functions indicating history-dependent action selection, with distance 
predicting action initiation and angular position predicting wing choices and 
locomotion directions. Integration of vision with somatosensation further boosts 
these sensorimotor relations. Essentially comprised of orchestrated wing and leg 
maneuvers that are more variable in the light, circling induces mutually 
synchronized conspecific responses stronger than wing extension alone. Finally, 
we found that actions depend on integrating spatiotemporally structured features 
with goals. Altogether, we identified a series of sensorimotor relations during 
circling, implying that during courtship, flies detect complex spatiotemporally 
structured features of conspecifics, laying the foundation for a mechanistic 
understanding of conspecific recognition in Drosophila.

RATIONALE: Aortic aneurysm (AA) is a serious condition that largely increases 
the risk of aortic dissection and sudden death. Exploring the global burden of 
disease and changes in risk factors for AA is essential for public health policy 
development.
OBJECTIVE: To project the death burden from AA and its attributable risk factors 
in the following decade based on the epidemiological data over the past 
30 years.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the death burden of AA and trends of four risk 
factors from 1990-2019 using the updated 2019 Global Burden of Disease study 
database by Joinpoint regression analysis. Furthermore, we project the 
AA-related death burden for the next decade using the Bayesian age-period-cohort 
model. This study discovered that the global burden of death attributable to AA 
began to increase after decreasing for two decades. This upward trend will 
continue in the subsequent decade (average annual percent change: 0.318%, 95% 
CI: 0.288 to 0.348). Meanwhile, the disease burdens in all economic regions 
except high-middle socio-demographic index (SDI) regions will continuously 
increase in the next decade, with the fastest acceleration in the low-middle SDI 
region (average annual percent change: 1.183%, 95% CI: 1.166 to 1.200). Notably, 
high systolic blood pressure will surpass the contribution of smoking to become 
the most important risk factor for mortality due to AA.
CONCLUSION: This study discovered a rebounding trend in the aortic 
aneurysm-related death burden globally. High systolic blood pressure will be the 
top risk factor attributed to death from AA. Therefore, it should be considered 
as the first-degree risk factor in the guidance of AA management and criteria 
for population-based screening programs.Key messagesThe death burden of aortic 
aneurysms is beginning to rebound globally, and the trend will continue for the 
next decade.High systolic blood pressure will replace smoking as the most 
important risk factor associated with aortic aneurysm death.

BACKGROUND: The impacts on mortality of both the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and the 
interventions to manage it differ between countries. The Rapid Mortality 
Surveillance System set up by the South African Medical Research Council based 
on data from the National Population Register (NPR) provides a means of tracking 
this impact on mortality in South Africa.
OBJECTIVES: To report on the change in key metrics of mortality (numbers of 
deaths, life expectancy at birth, life expectancy at age 60, and infant, 
under-5, older child and adolescent, young adult, and adult mortality) over the 
period 2015 - 2020. The key features of the impact are contrasted with those 
measured in other countries.
METHODS: The numbers of registered deaths by age and sex recorded on the NPR 
were increased to account for both registered deaths that are not captured by 
the NPR and an estimate of deaths not reported. The estimated numbers of deaths 
together with estimates of the numbers in the population in the middle of each 
of the years were used to produce life tables and calculate various indicators.
RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2020, the number of deaths increased by nearly 53 000 
(65% female), and life expectancy at birth fell by 1 year for females and by 
only 2.5 months for males. Life expectancy at age 60 decreased by 1.6 years for 
females and 1.2 years for males. Infant mortality, under-5 mortality and 
mortality of children aged 5 - 14 decreased by 22%, 20% and 10%, respectively, 
while that for older children and adolescents decreased by 11% for males and 5% 
for females. Premature adult mortality, the probability of a 15-year-old dying 
before age 60, increased by 2% for males and 9% for females.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and the interventions to manage it had differential 
impacts on mortality by age and sex. The impact of the epidemic on life 
expectancy in 2020 differs from that in most other, mainly developed, countries, 
both in the limited decline and also in the greater impact on females. These 
empirical estimates of life expectancy and mortality rates are not reflected by 
estimates from agencies, either because agency estimates have yet to be updated 
for the impact of the epidemic or because they have not allowed for the impact 
correctly. Trends in weekly excess deaths suggest that the drop in life 
expectancy in 2021 will be greater than that in 2020.

The wide transmission and host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the rapid 
accumulation of mutations, posing significant challenges to the effectiveness of 
vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Although several neutralizing antibodies 
were authorized for emergency clinical use, convalescent patients derived 
natural antibodies are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation. Here, we 
describe the screen of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) 
targeted nanobodies (Nbs) from a synthetic library and the design of a 
biparatopic Nb, named Nb1-Nb2, with tight affinity and super-wide neutralization 
breadth against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Deep-mutational 
scanning experiments identify the potential binding epitopes of the Nbs on the 
RBD and demonstrate that biparatopic Nb1-Nb2 has a strong escape-resistant 
feature against more than 60 tested RBD amino acid substitutions. Using 
pseudovirion-based and trans-complementation SARS-CoV-2 tools, we determine that 
the Nb1-Nb2 broadly neutralizes multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants at sub-nanomolar 
levels, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta 
(B.1.617.2), Lambda (C.37), Kappa (B.1.617.1), and Mu (B.1.621). Furthermore, a 
heavy-chain antibody is constructed by fusing the human IgG1 Fc to Nb1-Nb2 
(designated as Nb1-Nb2-Fc) to improve its neutralization potency, yield, 
stability, and potential half-life extension. For the new Omicron variant 
(B.1.1.529) that harbors unprecedented multiple RBD mutations, Nb1-Nb2-Fc keeps 
a firm affinity (KD < 1.0 × 10-12 M) and strong neutralizing activity 
(IC50 = 1.46 nM for authentic Omicron virus). Together, we developed a 
tetravalent biparatopic human heavy-chain antibody with ultrapotent and 
broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity which highlights the potential 
clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Transforaminal full endoscopic lateral recess decompression (TE-LRD) 
can decompress lateral recess stenosis transforaminally under the endoscopy 
procedure. However, the biomechanical effects of the TE-LRD compared to the 
conventional decompression techniques are not reported. The purpose of this 
study is to compare the biomechanical effects of TE-LRD with conventional 
decompression techniques using finite element method.
METHODS: Three finite element models of lumbar functional spinal unit (FSU) of 
the L4-L5 levels were created: 1) normal disc 2) moderate grade disc 
degeneration 3) severe grade disc degeneration. For each of these three models, 
the following decompression techniques were simulated, 1) 50% TE-LRD, 2) 100% 
TE-LRD, 3) Unilateral laminectomy, 4) Bilateral laminectomy. The lower endplate 
of the fifth lumbar vertebra was fixed and 10Nm of moment in flexion/extension, 
left/right bending and axial rotation was applied to the upper endplate of the 
fourth lumbar vertebra, under a follower load of 400N. The range of motion, 
intervertebral disc stress, and facet joint stress were compared.
RESULTS: 50% TE-LRD was found to be the most stable decompression technique in 
all intervertebral disc models. Though the increase in the range of motion of 
100% TE-LRD was higher than other decompression techniques in the normal disc 
model, it was not significantly different from 50% TE-LRD or unilateral 
laminectomy techniques in the degenerated disc models. The increase in the 
intervertebral disc stress was lowest for the 50% TE-LRD surgery in all 
intervertebral disc models. The increase in the facet stresses for 50% TE-LRD 
was lower than in the conventional decompression techniques for all 
intervertebral disc models.
CONCLUSIONS: 50% TE-LRD was the decompression surgical technique with the least 
effect on spinal instability. 100% TE-LRD showed to be effective for cases with 
degenerative discs. 50% TE-LRD may decrease the risk of postoperative 
intervertebral disc and facet joint degeneration.

BACKGROUND: Patients with previously irradiated metastatic epidural spinal cord 
compression (MESCC) who are not surgical candidates are at high risk of 
neurologic deterioration due to disease in the setting of limited treatment 
options. We seek to establish the feasibility of using salvage spine 
stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) allowing for spinal cord dose constraint 
relaxation as the primary management of MESCC in inoperable patients monitoring 
for radiation related toxicity and radiographic local control (LC).
METHODS: Inoperable patients with previously irradiated MESCC were enrolled on 
this prospective Phase 1 single institution protocol. Single fraction SSRS was 
delivered to a prescription dose of 18 Gy. Spinal cord constraint relaxation was 
performed incrementally from an initial allowable Dmax cohort of 8 Gy to 14 Gy 
in the final planned cohort. Patients were monitored every 3 months with 
follow-up visits and MRI scans.
RESULTS: The trial was closed early due to slow accrual. From 2011 to 2014, 11 
patients were enrolled of which 9 patients received SSRS. Five patients were in 
the 8 Gy cord Dmax cohort and 4 in the 10 Gy cord Dmax cohort.The median overall 
survival (OS) was 11.9 months (95% CI 7.1, 22 months). Of the 9 patients treated 
with SSRS, 1 died prior to post-SSRS evaluation. Of the remaining 8 patients, 5 
experienced a local failure. Three of the five were treated with surgery while 
two received systemic therapy. Two of the five failures ultimately resulted in 
loss of neurologic function. The median LC was 9.1 months (95%CI 4.8, 20.1 
months). With a median clinical follow-up of 6.8 months, there were no cases of 
RM.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited life expectancy in this high-risk cohort of 
patients, strategies to optimize LC are necessary to prevent neurologic 
deterioration. Larger prospective trials exploring optimal dose/fractionation 
and cord constraints are required.

Contact prelithiation is strongly considered for compensating the initial 
capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries, exhibiting great potential for ultralong 
cycle life of working batteries and the application of large-scale 
energy-storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source 
for contact prelithiation is low (<65%). Herein the fundamental mechanism of 
contact prelithiation is described from the perspective of the Li source/anode 
interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and a clear illustration of 
the pathogeny for capacity attenuation is successfully delivered. Specifically, 
creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact 
prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current 
density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron 
channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the 
contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, 
rendering a Li utilization of 91.0%, and the dead Li yield is significantly 
reduced in a working battery.

INTRODUCTION: We estimate societal value of a disease-modifying Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) treatment that reduces progression by 30% in early stages.
METHODS: Using the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes 
Research value flower as framework, we estimate gross societal value, that is, 
not including treatment cost, from avoided medical and social care costs, 
productivity and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gains for patients and 
caregivers, adjusting for severity of disease, value of financial insurance, and 
value of insurance for currently unafflicted adults with a Markov model.
RESULTS: Predicted societal value from 2021 until 2041 is $2.62 trillion for the 
overall afflicted US population and $986 billion for the 2021 prevalent cohort 
or $134,418 per person, with valuation of patients' QALY gains (63%) and avoided 
nursing-home costs (20%) as largest components. Delays in access because of 
health system capacity constraints could reduce realized value between 52% and 
69%. The value of insurance for the unafflicted is $4.52 trillion or $18,399 on 
average per person.
DISCUSSION: With a total of $5.5 trillion, the projected gross societal value of 
a hypothetical AD treatment is substantial, which may help to put the cost of 
treatment into perspective.

Seed quality plays an important role in the agricultural and animal husbandry 
production, the effective utilization of genetic resources, the conservation of 
biodiversity and the restoration and reconstruction of plant communities. Seed 
aging is a common physiological phenomenon during storage. It is a natural 
irreversible process that occurs and develops along with the extension of seed 
storage time. It is not only related to the growth, yield and quality of seed 
and seedling establishment, but also has an important effect on the 
conservation, utilization and development of plant germplasm resources. The 
physiological mechanisms of seed aging are complex and diverse. Most studies 
focus on conventional physiological characterization, while systematic and 
comprehensive in-depth studies are lacking. Here we review the recent advances 
in understanding the physiology of seed aging process, including the methods of 
seed aging, the effect of aging on seed germination, and the physiological and 
molecular mechanisms of seed aging. The change of multiple physiological 
parameters, including seed vigor, electrical conductivity, malondialdehyde 
content and storage material in the seed, antioxidant enzyme activity and 
mitochondrial structure, were summarized. Moreover, insights into the mechanism 
of seed aging from the aspects of transcriptome, proteome and aging related gene 
function were summarized. This study may facilitate the research of seed biology 
and the conservation and utilization of germplasm resources.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health problem. While it is 
high among pregnant women in Ethiopia, the cases are under-reported, and the 
true extent of the issue is uncertain. The study is intended to determine the 
prevalence and determinants of IPV among pregnant women seeking antenatal care 
(ANC). A comparative cross-sectional survey was conducted in healthcare 
facilities, Northern Ethiopia, in 2019. A sample of 324 pregnant women visiting 
ANC service was selected by systematic sampling. Binary logistic regression was 
conducted to identify significant determinants. The prevalence of IPV during 
pregnancy was 36.3%. Lack of formal schooling, rural life, husband's additional 
sexual partners, lack of shared decisions, and partners' alcohol intake were 
identified as a predictor of IPV. It is important to consider raising awareness, 
enhancing women's decision-making abilities, and educating women. Furthermore, 
partner involvement should be addressed to minimize violence against women in 
the community.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Intimate 
partner abuse (IPV) is a global public health problem as well as a significant 
violation of human rights, and Ethiopia has the world's highest rates of 
physical and sexual IPV. The immediate effect of IPV during pregnancy (sexually 
transmitted infections (STI), intrauterine growth retardations (IUGR), preterm 
labour, miscarriage, abortion, antepartum haemorrhage, perinatal death) was 
known.What do the results of this study add? Even though the outcome of IPV 
among pregnant women was recognised, the underlying factors of the violence were 
not well understood. As a result, this research will contribute to our 
understanding of the determinants of IPV among pregnant women.What are the 
implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? In 
this research, we revealed that the majority of the determinants of IPV among 
pregnant women were linked to their husband's behaviour, and that women's 
decision-making capacity and educational level were also root causes of the 
violence. Therefore, Women empowerment and partner participation during 
antenatal care would offer outstanding feedback to reduce partner violence. 
Aside from that, more research in family health would provide in-depth knowledge 
about the root cause of the violence.

In recent years, multisensory integration of visual and olfactory stimuli has 
extensively been explored resulting in the identification of responsible brain 
areas. As the experimental designs of previous research often include 
alternating presentations of unimodal and bimodal stimuli, the conditions cannot 
be regarded as completely independent. This could lead to effects of an expected 
but surprisingly missing sensory modality. In our experiment, we used a common 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study design with alternating 
strong unimodal and bimodal olfactory-visual food stimuli, in addition to a 
slight overhang of the bimodal stimuli in an effort to examine the effects of 
removing a visual or olfactory congruent stimulus for older people 
(41-83 years). Our results suggest that the processing of olfactory and visual 
stimuli stays intact over a wide age-range and that the utilization of strong 
stimuli does not lead to superadditive multisensory integration in accordance 
with the principle of inverse effectiveness. However, our results demonstrate 
that the removal of a stimulus modality leads to an activation of additional 
brain areas. For example, when the visual stimulus modality is missing, the 
right posterior superior temporal gyrus shows higher activation, whereas the 
removal of the olfactory stimulus modality leads to higher activation in the 
amygdala/hippocampus and the postcentral gyrus. These brain areas are related to 
attention, memory, and the search of the missing stimulus. Consequently, careful 
attention must be paid to the design of a valid, multimodal sensory experiment 
while also controlling for cognitive expectancy effects that might confound 
multimodal results.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable disease characterized by 
muscle atrophy leading to complete paralysis. Once diagnosed, the average life 
expectancy is three to five years. In this context, palliative and end-of-life 
care are essential, as well as the development of cognitive and/or psychological 
therapies to improve the quality of life of patients. In this context, we 
conducted a review of the pertinent literature about psychological and cognitive 
interventions in end-of-life support for ALS patients. We identified 504 
references out of which only four studies met our inclusion criteria. Two 
studies focused on dignity therapy, one study on the delay between the diagnosis 
and the start of psychological care in a specialized centre, and one case-report 
on psychological therapy combined with a computer-assisted communication system. 
The results of these studies, although very limited, suggest that psychological 
interventions may improve the management and quality of life of end-of-life ALS 
patients. Further studies should investigate the impact of psychological support 
adapted to ALS, using, for example, computer-assisted communication allowing to 
implement these interventions in a larger number of patients and over the long 
term.

Publisher: La sclérose latérale amyotrophique (SLA) est une maladie 
neurogénérative qui se caractérise notamment par une amyotrophie progressive 
évoluant jusqu’à la paralysie complète du patient dont l’espérance de vie est, 
en moyenne, de trois à cinq ans. Les soins palliatifs et le développement de 
thérapies pour améliorer la qualité de vie des patients sont essentiels. Dans ce 
cadre, nous avons réalisé une revue de la littérature portant sur les 
interventions psychologiques et cognitives dans la prise en charge des patients 
atteins de SLA en fin de vie. Nous avons identifié 504 références dont quatre 
rapportant des études qui répondaient aux critères d’inclusion. Deux études 
portaient sur la thérapie de la dignité, une sur la rapidité d’une prise en 
charge psychologique dans un centre spécialisé et un rapport de cas concernait 
une prise en charge psychologique combinée à un système de communication 
assistée par ordinateur. Les résultats de ces quatre études, bien que limités, 
suggèrent que les interventions psychologiques pourraient améliorer la qualité 
de vie des patients en fin de vie. De nouvelles recherches devraient être menées 
pour investiguer l’impact d’une prise en charge psychologique adaptée à la SLA 
en utilisant, par exemple, une communication assistée afin d’implémenter ces 
interventions sur un plus grand nombre de patients et sur le long terme.

The extension of life span driven by 40% caloric restriction (CR) in rodents 
causes trade-offs in growth, reproduction, and immune defense that make it 
difficult to identify therapeutically relevant CR-mimetic targets. We report 
that about 14% CR for 2 years in healthy humans improved thymopoiesis and was 
correlated with mobilization of intrathymic ectopic lipid. CR-induced 
transcriptional reprogramming in adipose tissue implicated pathways regulating 
mitochondrial bioenergetics, anti-inflammatory responses, and longevity. 
Expression of the gene Pla2g7 encoding platelet activating factor acetyl 
hydrolase (PLA2G7) is inhibited in humans undergoing CR. Deletion of Pla2g7 in 
mice showed decreased thymic lipoatrophy, protection against age-related 
inflammation, lowered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and improved metabolic 
health. Therefore, the reduction of PLA2G7 may mediate the immunometabolic 
effects of CR and could potentially be harnessed to lower inflammation and 
extend the health span.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections are the most frequent health problem in 
childhood leading to morbidity and socioeconomic burden. Studying symptoms of 
respiratory infections in home based settings requires dedicated prospective 
cohort studies using diaries. However, no information is available on which 
birth cohort studies using symptom diary data. A review of birth cohort studies 
with available symptom diary data, follow-up data, and bio samples is needed to 
support research collaborations and create potential synergies.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of birth cohort studies using diaries for 
the collection of respiratory symptoms. The scoping review was conducted in 
accordance with the PRISMA Extension. We searched the electronic databases 
PubMed, Embase, Web of science and CINAHL (last search November 2020) resulting 
in 5872 records (based on title and abstract screening) eligible for further 
screening.
RESULTS: We examined 735 records as full text articles and finally included 57 
according to predefined inclusion criteria. We identified 22 birth cohort 
studies that collect(ed) data on respiratory symptoms using a symptom diary 
starting at birth. Numbers of participants ranged from 129 to 8677. Eight 
studies collected symptom diary information only for the first year of life, 
nine for the first two years or less and six between three and six years. Most 
of the cohorts collected biosamples (n = 18) and information on environmental 
exposures (n = 19).
CONCLUSION: Information on respiratory symptoms with daily resolution was 
collected in several birth cohorts, often including related biosamples, and 
these data and samples can be used to study full spectrum of infections, 
particularly including those which did not require medical treatment.
