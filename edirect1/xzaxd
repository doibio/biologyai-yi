Engineering, Beer-Sheva, Israel.

OBJECTIVE: Firstly, to compare healthcare systems' efficiency (HSE) using two 
models: one incorporating mostly inputs that are considered to be within the 
discretionary control of the healthcare system (i.e., physicians' density, 
inpatient bed density, and health expenditure), and another, including mostly 
inputs beyond healthcare systems' control (i.e., GDP, fruit and vegetables 
consumption, and health expenditure). Secondly, analyze whether institutional 
arrangements, population behavior, and socioeconomic or environmental 
determinants are associated with HSE.
DESIGN: Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was utilized to calculate OECD 
countries' HSE. Life expectancy and infant survival rate were considered as 
outputs in both models. Healthcare systems' rankings according to the 
super-efficiency and the cross-efficiency ranking methods were used to analyze 
determinants associated with efficiency.
RESULTS: (1) Healthcare systems in nine countries with large and stable 
economies were defined as efficient in model I, but were found to be inefficient 
in model II; (2) Gatekeeping and the presence of multiple insurers were 
associated with a lower efficiency; and (3) The association between 
socioeconomic and environmental indicators was found to be ambiguous.
CONCLUSIONS: Countries striving to improve their HSE should aim to impact 
population behavior and welfare rather than only ensure adequate medical care. 
In addition, they may consider avoiding specific institutional arrangements, 
namely gatekeeping and the presence of multiple insurers. Finally, the ambiguous 
association found between socioeconomic and environmental indicators, and a 
country's HSE necessitates caution when interpreting different ranking 
techniques in a cross-country efficiency evaluation and needs further 
exploration.

Many therapeutic proteins possessing a small size are rapidly cleared from 
circulation. Half-life extension strategies have therefore become increasingly 
important to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
protein therapeutics. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of the half-life 
extension properties of various bacterial immunoglobulin-binding domains (IgBDs) 
derived from Staphylococcus protein A (SpA), Streptococcus protein G (SpG), and 
Finegoldia (formerly Peptostreptococcus) protein L (PpL). These domains, 
composed of 50-60 amino acid residues, were fused to the C terminus of a 
single-chain Fv and a bispecific single-chain diabody, respectively. All fusion 
proteins were produced in mammalian cells and retained their antigen-binding 
properties. The half-lives of the antibody molecules were prolonged to varying 
extents for the different IgBDs. The strongest effects in mice were observed for 
domain C3 of SpG (SpG(C3)) followed by domains B and D of SpA, suggesting that 
SpG(C3) is particularly useful to extend the plasma half-life of small proteins.

BACKGROUND: The best strategies to screen postmenopausal women for osteoporosis 
are not clear.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies.
DESIGN: Individual-level state-transition cost-effectiveness model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women aged 55 years or older.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Payer.
INTERVENTION: Screening strategies composed of alternative tests (central 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA], calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography 
[QUS], and the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation [SCORE] tool) 
initiation ages, treatment thresholds, and rescreening intervals. Oral 
bisphosphonate treatment was assumed, with a base-case adherence rate of 50% and 
a 5-year on/off treatment pattern.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2010 U.S. dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: At all evaluated ages, screening was superior to 
not screening. In general, quality-adjusted life-days gained with screening 
tended to increase with age. At all initiation ages, the best strategy with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than $50,000 per QALY was 
DXA screening with a T-score threshold of -2.5 or less for treatment and with 
follow-up screening every 5 years. Across screening initiation ages, the best 
strategy with an ICER less than $50,000 per QALY was initiation of screening at 
age 55 years by using DXA -2.5 with rescreening every 5 years. The best strategy 
with an ICER less than $100,000 per QALY was initiation of screening at age 55 
years by using DXA with a T-score threshold of -2.0 or less for treatment and 
then rescreening every 10 years. No other strategy that involved treatment of 
women with osteopenia had an ICER less than $100,000 per QALY. Many other 
strategies, including strategies with SCORE or QUS prescreening, were also 
cost-effective, and in general the differences in effectiveness and costs 
between evaluated strategies was small.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Probabilistic sensitivity analysis did not 
reveal a consistently superior strategy.
LIMITATIONS: Data were primarily from white women. Screening initiation at ages 
younger than 55 years were not examined. Only osteoporotic fractures of the hip, 
vertebrae, and wrist were modeled.
CONCLUSION: Many strategies for postmenopausal osteoporosis screening are 
effective and cost-effective, including strategies involving screening 
initiation at age 55 years. No strategy substantially outperforms another.

388-1, Ssangmun, Dobong, Seoul 132-703, Korea.

The monetary value of the man-mSv for operators of Korean nuclear power plants 
(NPPs) was calculated using a radiation aversion factor based on a survey of NPP 
workers. Initially, the life expectancy in the population is 79.4 y, the average 
age of cancer occurrence is 60 y, the average annual wage for an electric worker 
is 56 000 $ y(-1) and the nominal risk coefficient induced by radiation is 
4.2E(-5) mSv were used to evaluate the basic monetary value (α(base)) resulting 
in 45.6 $ mSv(-1). To investigate the degree of radiation aversion, the subject 
of the investigation was selected as the working radiation workers in 10 NPPs in 
Korea (Kori 1-2, Yeonggwang 1-3, Ulchin 1-3 and Wolseong 1-2). In August 2010, 
with the cooperation of KHNP and partner companies, a total of 2500 survey 
questionnaires to 10 NPPs (or 250 surveys to each NPP) were distributed to 
currently employed radiation workers. From these, 2157 responses were obtained 
between August and October 2010. The assessed radiation aversion factor and the 
monetary value of the man-mSv from the calculated radiation aversion factor were 
1.26 and ∼50 $ in the 0-1 mSv range, 1.38 and ∼200 $ in the 1-5 mSv range, 1.52 
and ∼1000 $ in the 5-10 mSv range, 1.65 and ∼4000 $ in the 10-20 mSv range and 
1.74 and ∼8500 $ >20 mSv.

University, Beijing, China.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the cost and cost-effectiveness of 
methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan 
province, China. The cost-effectiveness analysis used process data 
retrospectively collected from the MMT clinics in Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan 
Province, from July 2005 to December 2007, a 30-month period available at the 
time of the study. Alternative estimates of the number of HIV infections 
prevented were calculated using incidence rate from cohort studies and 
retrospective studies. Program costs were collected retrospectively following 
standard methods using an ingredients methodology. The cost for each participant 
treated in MMT clinics was about $9.1-16.7 per month and the intervention 
averted 8.4-87.2 HIV infections with a cost-effectiveness of US$ 2509.3-4609.3 
per HIV infection averted. This research demonstrates that MMT is a 
cost-effective intervention for reducing HIV transmission among injecting drug 
users, but the coverage of MMT intervention should be matched with the designed 
volume of MMT clinics to make the best use of resources.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how calibration uncertainty 
affects the overall uncertainty of a mathematical model and to evaluate 
potential drivers of calibration uncertainty.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model of the natural history of human papillomavirus 
(HPV) infection and cervical disease was developed to assess the cost 
effectiveness of a hypothetical HPV vaccine. Published data on cervical cancer 
incidence and mortality and prevalence of pre-cursor lesions were used as 
endpoints to calibrate the age- and HPV-type-specific transition probabilities 
between health states using the Nelder-Mead simplex method of calibration. A 
conventional probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to assess 
uncertainty in vaccine efficacy, cost and utility estimates. To quantify the 
uncertainty around calibrated transition probabilities, a second PSA 
(calibration PSA) was performed using 25 distinct combinations of objective 
functions and starting simplexes.
RESULTS: The initial calibration produced an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $US 4300 per QALY for vaccination compared with no vaccination, 
and the conventional PSA gave a 95% credible interval of dominant to $US 9800 
around this estimate (2005 values). The 95% credible interval for the ICERs in 
the calibration PSA ranged from $US 1000 to $US 37,700.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a conventional PSA, the calibration PSA results 
reveal a greater level of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results. Sensitivity 
analyses around model calibration should be performed to account for uncertainty 
arising from the calibration process.

AIMS: To estimate remaining life expectancy (RLE), quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE), causes of death and lifetime cumulative incidence of 
microvascular/macrovascular complications of diabetes for youths diagnosed with 
Type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: A Markov-like computer model simulated the life course for a 
hypothetical cohort of adolescents/young adults in the USA, aged 15-24 years, 
newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes following either conventional or intensive 
treatment based on the UK Prospective Diabetes Study. Outcomes included RLE, 
discounted QALE in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cumulative incidence of 
microvascular/macrovascular complications and causes of death.
RESULTS: Compared with a mean RLE of 58.6 years for a 20-year-old in the USA 
without diabetes, conventional treatment produced an average RLE of 43.09 years 
and 22.44 discounted QALYs. Intensive treatment afforded an incremental 0.98 
years and 0.44 discounted QALYs. Intensive treatment led to lower lifetime 
cumulative incidence of all microvascular complications and lower mortality from 
microvascular complications (e.g. end-stage renal disease (ESRD) death 19.4% vs. 
25.2%). Approximately 5% with both treatments had ESRD within 25 years. Lifetime 
cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) increased with longer RLE 
and greater severity of CHD risk factors. Incorporating disutility (loss in 
health-related quality of life) of intensive treatment resulted in net loss of 
QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents/young adults with Type 2 diabetes lose approximately 15 
years from average RLE and may experience severe, chronic complications of Type 
2 diabetes by their 40s. The net clinical benefit of intensive treatment may be 
sensitive to preferences for treatment. A comprehensive management plan that 
includes early and aggressive control of cardiovascular risk factors is likely 
needed to reduce lifetime risk of CHD.

Mortality estimates for many populations are derived using model life tables, 
which describe typical age patterns of human mortality. We propose a new system 
of model life tables as a means of improving the quality and transparency of 
such estimates. A flexible two-dimensional model was fitted to a collection of 
life tables from the Human Mortality Database. The model can be used to estimate 
full life tables given one or two pieces of information: child mortality only, 
or child and adult mortality. Using life tables from a variety of sources, we 
have compared the performance of new and old methods. The new model outperforms 
the Coale-Demeny and UN model life tables. Estimation errors are similar to 
those produced by the modified Brass logit procedure. The proposed model is 
better suited to the practical needs of mortality estimation, since both input 
parameters are continuous yet the second one is optional.

Development and experimental identification of a biomechanical model of the 
trunk for functional electrical stimulation control in paraplegia.

Objectives.  Theoretic modeling and experimental studies suggest that functional 
electrical stimulation (FES) can improve trunk balance in spinal cord injured 
subjects. This can have a positive impact on daily life, increasing the volume 
of bimanual workspace, improving sitting posture, and wheelchair propulsion. A 
closed loop controller for the stimulation is desirable, as it can potentially 
decrease muscle fatigue and offer better rejection to disturbances. This paper 
proposes a biomechanical model of the human trunk, and a procedure for its 
identification, to be used for the future development of FES controllers. The 
advantage over previous models resides in the simplicity of the solution 
proposed, which makes it possible to identify the model just before a 
stimulation session (taking into account the variability of the muscle response 
to the FES). Materials and Methods.  The structure of the model is based on 
previous research on FES and muscle physiology. Some details could not be 
inferred from previous studies, and were determined from experimental data. 
Experiments with a paraplegic volunteer were conducted in order to measure the 
moments exerted by the trunk-passive tissues and artificially stimulated 
muscles. Data for model identification and validation also were collected. 
Results.  Using the proposed structure and identification procedure, the model 
could adequately reproduce the moments exerted during the experiments. The study 
reveals that the stimulated trunk extensors can exert maximal moment when the 
trunk is in the upright position. In contrast, previous studies show that 
able-bodied subjects can exert maximal trunk extension when flexed forward. 
Conclusions.  The proposed model and identification procedure are a successful 
first step toward the development of a model-based controller for trunk FES. The 
model also gives information on the trunk in unique conditions, normally not 
observable in able-bodied subjects (ie, subject only to extensor muscles 
contraction).

BACKGROUND: Depression is a potential risk factor for mortality among the aged 
and it is also associated with other chronic diseases and unhealthy lifestyles 
that may also affect mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
association between depressive symptoms and mortality, controlling for health, 
nutritional status, and life-style factors.
METHODS: A cohort of elderly people (N = 167) was followed-up for ten years. 
Information on socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, smoking, and 
alcohol consumption was collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; 
the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality. The Geriatric Depression 
Scale (GDS-15) was used to assess depression. Using a multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards regression, we examined the association between depressive 
symptoms and mortality.
RESULTS: Elderly people with depression (scoring above the depression cut-off of 
7) had a 53% increased risk of mortality (relative risk (RR) 1.53; 95%CI: 
1.05-2.24) compared to non-depressed subjects. The combination of depressive 
symptoms with smoking was associated with a particularly higher risk of 
mortality (RR: 2.61; 95%CI: 1.28-5.31), after controlling for potential 
confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with a significantly increased 
risk of all-cause mortality. The combination of depressive symptoms and smoking 
shorten life expectancy among the aged.

treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease: a US 
payer perspective.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate (LC) versus 
sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) as a treatment for hyperphosphatemia in end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) patients.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate health outcomes; 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life-years saved (LYS), as well as 
associated costs. The model incorporated patient-level data from a randomized 
head-to-head crossover study that compared the reduction of serum phosphorus 
using LC and SH for 4 weeks each. The model included patients previously treated 
with calcium-based binders. Both the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the 
cohort of patients who completed treatment in both periods of the study (i.e., 
completer population) were assessed. The baseline risks of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD), all-cause mortalities for CVD, and non-CVD patients were derived 
from a large US renal database. Patient outcomes were modeled for 10 years, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for LC relative to 
SH. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to 
test the robustness of the base-case model.
RESULTS: For the ITT population, the ICERs of LC versus SH were $24,724/QALY and 
$15,053/LYS, respectively (in US dollars). When the completer population was 
considered, the ICERs of LC versus SH were $15,285/QALY and $9,337/LYS (Table 
2), respectively. The PSA indicated 61.9% and 85.8% probabilities for ITT and 
completer populations of LC being cost-effective at the $50,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold, respectively.
CONCLUSION: LC is a cost-effective strategy compared with SH in the treatment of 
ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia who were previously treated with 
calcium-based binders. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the 
pharmacoeconomic model.

Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA 02111, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To review and evaluate the literature of cost-utility analyses (CUAs) 
regarding diagnostic laboratory testing.
METHODS: We reviewed all articles related to diagnostic laboratory testing in 
the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry 
(www.cearegistry.org), which contains detailed information on over 2000 
published CUAs through 2008. We analyzed the extent to which the studies adhered 
to recommended practices for conducting and reporting cost-effectiveness 
analyses. We also recorded whether the studies contained information on 
diagnostic test accuracy and costs, and whether any account was taken of 
potential benefits or harms of testing that are unrelated to subsequent 
treatment, such as the reassurance value of testing.
RESULTS: We identified 141 published CUAs pertaining to diagnostic laboratory 
testing published through 2008 which contained 433 separate incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. Prior to 2000, there were only 20 CUAs published, but 
the number averaged 13.4 annually thereafter. Most studies focused on 
hematology/oncology (n = 42, 30%) and obstetrics/gynecology (n = 36, 26%) 
applications. Approximately 63% (n = 89) of studies clearly reported information 
about the accuracy of the test, but only 10% (n = 14) mentioned test safety or 
possible risks. A small number (n = 10, 7%) mentioned or considered the 
potential value or harm of testing unrelated to treatment consequences. Over 55% 
of the reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were either 
dominant (more quality-adjusted life years for less cost), or below $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life years gained (in 2008 US dollars).
CONCLUSION: The number of CUAs investigating laboratory diagnostic testing has 
increased substantially with applications to diverse clinical areas. The 
literature reveals many areas in which testing represents good value for money. 
The vast majority of studies have not considered preferences for test 
information unrelated to treatment consequences.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a stochastic population model of disease progression in 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that includes the effects of COPD 
exacerbations on health-related quality of life, costs, disease progression, and 
mortality and can be used to assess the effects of a wide range of 
interventions.
METHODS: The model is a multistate Markov model with time varying transition 
rates specified by age, sex, smoking status, COPD disease severity, and/or 
exacerbation type. The model simulates annual changes in COPD prevalence due to 
COPD incidence, exacerbations, disease progression (annual decline in the forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second as percentage of the predicted value), and 
mortality. The main outcome variables are quality-adjusted life years, total 
exacerbations, and COPD-related health care costs. Exacerbation-related input 
parameters were based on quantitative meta-analysis. All important model 
parameters are entered into the model as probability distributions. To 
illustrate the potential use of the model, costs and effects were calculated for 
3-year implementation of three different COPD interventions, one pharmacologic, 
one on smoking cessation, and one on pulmonary rehabilitation using a time 
horizon of 10 years for reporting outcomes.
RESULTS: Compared with minimal treatment the cost/quality-adjusted life year was 
€8,300 for the pharmacologic intervention, €10,800 for the smoking cessation 
therapy, €8,700 for the combination of the pharmacologic intervention and the 
smoking cessation therapy, and €17,200 for the pulmonary rehabilitation program. 
The probability of the interventions to be cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of 
€20,000 varied from 58% to 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: The COPD model provides policy makers with information about the 
long-term costs and effects of interventions over the entire chain of care, from 
primary prevention to care for very severe COPD and includes uncertainty around 
the outcomes.

lopinavir/ritonavir in Africa: estimates based on DART trial results and costs 
for Uganda and Kenya.

Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. simpsonk@musc.edu

BACKGROUND: Substantial immunological improvement has been reported for 
HIV-infected patients who switch from a failing regimen to a protease inhibitor 
regimen with Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). We use decision analysis modeling to 
estimate health and economic consequences expected from this switch.
METHODS: A Markov model combined best evidence for CD4(+) T-cell response, 
infectious disease events, death rates, and quality of life for African 
populations with Kenyan and Ugandan data on drug and medical care costs. We 
estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of switching to an LPV/r-based 
regimen versus remaining on a failed first antiretroviral (ARV) regimen or 
discontinuing all ARV drugs. The model assumes concurrent use of cotrimoxazole, 
and 4% annual loss to follow-up. Local effects due to prevalence of malaria and 
tuberculosis are included in the model. Sensitivity analysis examines the 
effects of varying disease, ARV therapy and CD4(+) T-cell cost, and ART 
discontinuation assumptions.
RESULTS: The base model estimates an improvement of 20 months in average 
survival for the LPV/r group. The respective LPV/r ICER for Kenya is $1483 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to $1673/QALY for Uganda. The ICERs 
increase to $1517 and $1707, respectively, if CD4(+) T-cell tests cost $25. The 
model comparing switching to LPV/r to discontinuing all ARV drugs decreases both 
costs and benefits proportionally for the treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: The estimates are clearly below the most stringent World Health 
Organization benchmark for cost-effectiveness for Kenya and within the 
acceptable range of cost-effectiveness for Uganda. Thus, the switch to 
second-line therapy with LPV/r in these countries appears to be a cost-effective 
use of resources.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib 
compared with high-dose imatinib for people with chronic phase chronic myeloid 
leukemia, which are resistant to normal-dose imatinib and compared with 
interferon-α for people intolerant to imatinib, from the perspective of the UK 
National Health Service.
METHODS: An an area under the curve partitioned survival model was developed to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib. Clinical 
effectiveness evidence was taken mostly from single-arm trials.
RESULTS: Both progression-free survival and overall survival are highly 
uncertain. In the base case, patients take nilotinib for much less time than 
dasatinib. Nilotinib is expected to dominate high-dose imatinib, yielding 
slightly more (0.32) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at slightly less cost 
(£11,100 [pound sterling]) per person. Dasatinib is predicted to provide 
slightly more (0.53) QALYs at substantially greater cost (£48,900), yielding a 
very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £91,500 QALY against high-dose 
imatinib. Cost-effectiveness, however, changes radically under the plausible 
assumption that the drugs are taken for the same time. For people intolerant to 
imatinib, nilotinib is expected to yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of £104,700/QALY, and dasatinib £82,600/QALY compared with interferon-α. 
Further, both drugs represent poor value for money for a range of plausible 
structural assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: The model should be viewed as an exploratory analysis of the 
cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib because it relies on many 
assumptions. Whilst clinical data remains immature, the cost-effectiveness of 
dasatinib and nilotinib for imatinib-resistant people is highly uncertain. Both 
nilotinib and dasatinib are highly unlikely to be cost-effective versus 
interferon-α for people intolerant to imatinib.

Structural frameworks and key model parameters in cost-effectiveness analyses 
for current and future treatments of chronic hepatitis C.

OBJECTIVES: Published economic evaluations have reported available treatments 
for chronic hepatitis C to be cost-effective as part of the current approach to 
disease management, but as standards of care evolve, their approach to modeling 
should be reconsidered. This study aimed to review structural frameworks and key 
model parameters as reported in current economic evaluations for treatments for 
chronic hepatitis C, and model the impact of variability across parameters on 
results.
METHODS: A systematic review of studies published from 2000 to 2011 was 
performed. Studies were retrieved from five electronic databases using relevant 
search strategies. Model structures, disease progression rates, utilities, and 
costs were extracted from included studies, and were qualitatively reviewed and 
incorporated into a cost-utility model.
RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were appropriate for data extraction. A common 
pathway of six disease states was identified. In some studies the early disease 
stages and/or the decompensated cirrhosis state were further subdivided. Large 
variability in values used for disease progression rates, utilities, and costs 
were identified. When incorporated into a model, incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) varied: in the least favorable scenario, peginterferon plus 
ribavirin was dominated by interferon plus ribavirin; and in the most favorable 
scenario, peginterferon plus ribavirin dominated interferon plus ribavirin 
($8,544 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]; costs are given in 2008 US dollar 
amounts). Using mean values the ICER was $15,198 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Current models use a simplistic structure resulting from the lack 
of available data reflecting patient heterogeneity. Key model parameters are 
currently based on a small number of studies and the variability across these 
values can affect the interpretation of results.

year calculation method on the number of life years gained in the critical care 
setting.

OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained are basic elements in the cost-utility evaluations of 
health care. Different HRQoL instruments produce different scores for the same 
patient, and thus also a different number of QALYs. We examined the effect of 
these factors on the number of QALYs gained and the cost per QALY in the 
critical care setting.
METHODS: In 937 patients having been treated in the critical care setting in the 
Helsinki University Central Hospital the HRQoL scores were measured by the EQ-5D 
and 15D 6 and 12 months after start of treatment, and QALYs were calculated 
using four different sets of assumptions regarding recovery from disease.
RESULTS: The mean number of QALYs gained during the first year after treatment 
ranged from 0.178 ± 0.206 to 0.550 ± 0.508 and the consequent cost per QALY from 
€38,405 to €118,668 depending on HRQoL instrument and assumptions used in the 
calculations regarding recovery from disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The HRQoL instrument and the assumptions employed regarding 
recovery from disease have a great influence on the results of cost-utility 
analyses and should, therefore, be explicitly described in studies reporting 
QALYs. Furthermore, a common consensus on which calculation method should be 
used within critical care would be urgently needed.

Elicitation of informed general population health state utility values: a review 
of the literature.

Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada. hcowan@bccrc.ca

OBJECTIVE: Within a health-care decision-making context, whose health state 
utility values (HSUVs) should be used is constantly debated. This discussion is 
important because patient and general population utilities can differ. These 
discrepancies may be due to the general population not being informed about the 
health states. This article investigates approaches used to inform the general 
population about the health states that they are valuing.
METHODS: Studies reporting methods to obtain informed general population HSUVs 
were identified, outlined, and critically appraised.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified: seven used information sessions, two 
used simulation methods, two used reflection and deliberation techniques, and 
three used adaptation exercises.
CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated a range of approaches to elicit informed 
general population HSUVs. The majority of the studies indicated that informing 
the respondents significantly affected their opinions of the health states and 
hence their HSUVs. This suggests that the utilities that are currently used to 
guide health-care resource allocation decisions may not represent the general 
population's preferences for specific health states. This could result in 
decisions that do not maximize societal health benefits.

Healthcare policy tools as determinants of health-system efficiency: evidence 
from the OECD.

Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. dwl@dal.ca

This paper assesses which policy-relevant characteristics of a healthcare system 
contribute to health-system efficiency. Health-system efficiency is measured 
using the stochastic frontier approach. Characteristics of the health system are 
included as determinants of efficiency. Data from 21 OECD countries from 1970 to 
2008 are analysed. Results indicate that broader health-system structures, such 
as Beveridgian or Bismarckian financing arrangements or gatekeeping, are not 
significant determinants of efficiency. Significant contributors to efficiency 
are policy instruments that directly target patient behaviours, such as 
insurance coverage and cost sharing, and those that directly target physician 
behaviours, such as physician payment methods. From the perspective of the 
policymaker, changes in cost-sharing arrangements or physician remuneration are 
politically easier to implement than changes to the foundational financing 
structure of the system.

Cost and clinical implications of diabetes prevention in an Australian setting: 
a long-term modeling analysis.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Metformin and intensive lifestyle changes (ILC) reduced the 
incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) versus standard care (control) in overweight 
or obese subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in the Diabetes 
Prevention Program (DPP) trial and Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study 
(DPPOS). We projected lifetime clinical and economic outcomes based on the 
results from the DPP+DPPOS, from a 3rd-party payer perspective in Australia.
METHODS: A semi-Markov, 2nd-order Monte Carlo model was developed with four 
health states: "normal glucose regulation" (NGR); IGT; T2D and 'dead'. Outcomes 
were discounted at 5% annually. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Cumulative incidence (standard deviation) of T2D was 89.7% (0.2), 83.8% 
(0.2) and 73.4% (0.3%) for control, metformin and ILC respectively. Lifetime 
incremental direct costs were $1217 (4411) per subject for metformin versus 
control, with cost savings of $289 (4296) for ILC versus control. ILC therefore 
dominated control, with improvements in clinical outcomes and overall cost 
savings. Incremental costs per QALY-gained for metformin versus control were 
$10,142. Probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000 was 78% and 100% for metformin or ILC respectively. Results were most 
sensitive to probabilities of developing T2D and costs of implementing the 
interventions.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Substantial improvements in lifetime clinical 
outcomes could be expected in high risk subjects treated with metformin or ILC. 
Prevention of T2D in this group of subjects is good value for money, and may 
even lead to long term cost savings.

characters and clues: factors affecting children's extension of knowledge 
through integration of separate episodes.

Children build up knowledge about the world and also remember individual 
episodes. How individual episodes during which children learn new things become 
integrated with one another to form general knowledge is only beginning to be 
explored. Integration between separate episodes is called on in educational 
contexts and in everyday life as a major means of extending knowledge and 
organizing information. Bauer and San Souci (2010) provided an initial 
demonstration that 6-year-olds extend their knowledge by integrating between 
separate but related episodes; the episodes shared a high level of surface 
similarity. Experiments 1A and 1B of the current research were tests of 
integration under low and high levels of surface similarity, respectively. In 
Experiment 1A, when surface similarity of the episodes was low, 6-year-olds 
integrated between passages of text, yet their performance was not as robust as 
observed previously. In Experiment 1B, when surface similarity of the episodes 
was high, a replication of Bauer and San Souci's results was observed. In 
Experiment 2, we tested whether a "hint" to consult the information learned in 
the passages improved performance even when surface level similarity was low. 
The hint had a strong facilitating effect. Possible mechanisms of integration 
between separate yet related episodes are discussed.

Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965) the world-famous philosopher, theologian, concert 
organist, musicologist, philanthropist and winner of the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize 
suffered throughout most of his life from severe and painful muscle cramps in 
his right upper extremity which were triggered exclusively by handwriting. They 
led to tonic finger flexion and wrist extension and produced slow and clumsy 
handwriting of a reduced character size. Other motor functions including
