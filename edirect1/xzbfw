PURPOSE: The ability to quantify rotational laxity of the knee would increase 
understanding of functional rotatory instability, identify the best treatment 
methods for soft tissue injury, and have a role in diagnosis of soft tissue 
injury. This study aimed to report the reliability, repeatability and precision 
of a non-invasive adaptation of image-free navigation technology by comparing 
with a validated invasive system used for computer-assisted surgery.
METHODS: Twelve cadaveric lower limbs were tested with a commercial image-free 
navigation system using passive trackers secured by bone screws. They were then 
tested a non-invasive fabric-strap system. Manual application of torque was used 
consistent with clinical examination to rotate the tibia to the end of internal 
rotation and external rotation range. Measurements were taken at 10° intervals 
from full extension to 90° flexion, and protocol was repeated twice using each 
system. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to reflect reliability 
of measurements. At each flexion interval, coefficient of repeatability (CR) was 
calculated for each system, and limits of agreement (LOA) were used to reflect 
agreement between the systems.
RESULTS: The results for internal and external rotation were combined throughout 
flexion: ICC invasive; 0.94 (0.86-0.99), non-invasive; 0.92 (0.7-0.99), CR 
invasive; 2.4° (1.3-4.8°), non-invasive; 3.5° (1.8-6.6), LOA; 8.2° (4.3-13.5).
CONCLUSION: Non-invasive optical tracker fixation gives improved agreement with 
a validated method of measurement compared with devices measuring tibial 
rotation by foot position. This system gives the added possibility of dynamic, 
weight-bearing testing in the clinically important range of 0°-30° knee flexion 
without the need for any limb restraint.

Tumourigenic transformation of normal cells into cancer typically involves 
several steps resulting in acquisition of unlimited growth potential, evasion of 
apoptosis and non-responsiveness to growth inhibitory signals. Both genetic and 
epigenetic changes can contribute to cancer development and progression. Given 
the vast genetic heterogeneity of human cancers and difficulty to monitor 
cancer-initiating events in vivo, the precise relationship between acquisition 
of genetic mutations and the temporal progression of epigenetic alterations in 
transformed cells is largely unclear. Here, we use an in vitro model system to 
investigate the contribution of cellular immortality and oncogenic 
transformation of primary human cells to epigenetic reprogramming of DNA 
methylation and gene expression. Our data demonstrate that extension of 
replicative life span of the cells is sufficient to induce accumulation of DNA 
methylation at gene promoters and large-scale changes in gene expression in a 
time-dependent manner. In contrast, continuous expression of cooperating 
oncogenes in immortalized cells, although essential for anchorage-independent 
growth and evasion of apoptosis, does not affect de novo DNA methylation at 
promoters and induces subtle expression changes. Taken together, these 
observations imply that cellular immortality promotes epigenetic adaptation to 
highly proliferative state, whereas transforming oncogenes confer additional 
properties to transformed human cells.

Myelodysplastic syndromes are heterogeneous myeloid neoplasms ranging from 
indolent conditions with a near-normal life expectancy to forms approaching 
acute myeloid leukemia. Here we report a 51-year-old woman with depression and 
severe obesity who was diagnosed with an International Prognostic Scoring System 
low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, presenting mainly with thrombocytopenia, 
treated with escalating dose of valproic acid as a single agent. After two years 
of treatment her platelet count is almost normal and the tolerance to therapy is 
good. It is already known that valproic acid could be used in high-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, mainly in association with 
other drugs, but its role in low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome is not well 
established yet.

Fractures of the proximal femur are specific to older adults. Today, life 
expectancy for men and women is increasing, so one can expect an increased 
number of hip fractures. Elderly people suffer from associated diseases that may 
compromise the biological potential in healing of surgical wounds. On the other 
hand, there is an increased number of microorganisms resistant to antimicrobial 
drugs, so an increased number of postoperative infections can be expected. With 
conventional treatment methods of postoperative infections where the 
osteo-synthetic material is present in tissue, negative pressure therapy is 
gradually taking an increasingly important role in the treatment of these 
conditions. Because of its simple application in hospital or outpatient setting 
and good comfort with no pain for the patient, negative pressure therapy 
contributes significantly to healing of the wounds without removing 
osteosynthetic material from the wound.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol 
(CZP) treatment and to assess the efficacy of two CZP maintenance dosing 
schedules in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who could not receive 
methotrexate (MTX).
METHODS: HIKARI double-blind (DB) patients were entered into an open-label 
extension (OLE) study. Patients withdrawn at 16 weeks due to lack of efficacy 
and DB completers without a 24-week American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 
response received CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W). DB completers with 24-week 
ACR20 responses were randomized to CZP 200 mg Q2W or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks.
RESULTS: The ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates of DB completers (n = 98) were 
82.7%/56.1%/34.7% at OLE entry, and 83.7%/65.3%/48.0% at 52 weeks, respectively. 
Other clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes were sustained during 
long-term administration of CZP, even without MTX. No new unexpected adverse 
events were observed during long-term CZP treatment. The efficacy and safety of 
CZP treatment were similar between the two dosing schedules.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term CZP administration is efficacious and safe for RA 
patients. No obvious differences in clinical efficacy and safety were observed 
between the two dosing schedules. The choice between two maintenace regimens 
adds flexibility in administration schedules for RA patients and physicians.

, Mie , Japan.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to determine the relationship between 
osteoporosis (OP), vertebral fracture (VF) and mortality.
METHODS: We followed up 1024 residents of Miyagawa village every 2 years for a 
mean of 8.4 years between 1997 and 2009. The residents were assessed every 2 
years. We defined OP as T scores for bone mineral density that were < 2.5 
standard deviations below peak bone mass. VF was assessed by lateral radiography 
of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The participants were allocated as follows 
depending on the presence or absence of OP and VF: with OP and without VF (OP 
group), with VF and without OP (VF group), with OP and VF (OP + VF group) and 
without OP and VF (Control group). We determined survival/mortality rates until 
2011 by reviewing medical histories and death certificates.
RESULTS: By 2011, 304 participants had died. The respective 5-year survival 
rates for the OP + VF, OP, VF and Control groups were 80.6%, 93.7%, 87.8% and 
94.2%. Mortality rates were significantly worse for the OP + VF group than the 
Control group (OP + VF Hazard Ratio: 1.89; 95% CI, 1.27-2.77).
CONCLUSION: Prevention of osteoporotic VF in elderly persons is very important 
from the viewpoint of increasing life expectancy.

Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine for 
patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin - from the UK health 
care cost perspective.

Comment in
    Diabetes Obes Metab. 2014 Apr;16(4):289-93.

AIMS: The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin 
degludec (IDeg) versus insulin glargine (IGlar) in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) who are considered appropriate for treatment with a basal 
insulin analogue, using a short-term economic model.
METHODS: Meta-analysis data from three phase III clinical studies were used to 
populate a simple and transparent short-term model. The costs and effects of 
treatment with IDeg versus IGlar were calculated over a 12-month period. The 
analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the degree of uncertainty 
surrounding the results.
RESULTS: IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option versus IGlar in patients with 
T2DM using basal insulin. Base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were estimated at £15,795 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
£13,078 per QALY, which are below commonly accepted thresholds for 
cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that hypoglycaemia event 
rates had an important effect on the results. With higher event rates for 
non-severe hypoglycaemia IDeg was less costly and more effective than IGlar 
(dominant). Conversely, using lower event rates for severe hypoglycaemia 
generated higher ICERs. Using hypoglycaemia rates from a subgroup of patients 
who experienced ≥1 hypoglycaemic event per year IDeg was highly cost-effective 
versus IGlar; with estimated ICERS of £4887 and £2625 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This short-term modelling approach allows the economic evaluation 
of newer insulin analogues when advanced long-term modelling based on HbA1c 
differences is inappropriate. For patients with T2DM who are considered 
appropriate for treatment with a basal insulin analogue, IDeg is a 
cost-effective treatment option compared with IGlar and offers additional 
benefits to subgroups of patients, such as those suffering from recurrent 
hypoglycaemia.

Calorie restriction without malnutrition, commonly referred to as dietary 
restriction (DR), results in a well-documented extension of life span. DR also 
produces significant, long-lasting improvements in biomarkers of metabolic 
health that begin to accrue soon after its introduction. The improvements are 
attributable in part to the effects of DR on energy balance, which limit fat 
accumulation through reduction in energy intake. Accumulation of excess body fat 
occurs when energy intake chronically exceeds the energy costs for growth and 
maintenance of existing tissue. The resulting obesity promotes the development 
of insulin resistance, disordered lipid metabolism, and increased expression of 
inflammatory markers in peripheral tissues. The link between the life-extending 
effects of DR and adiposity is the subject of an ongoing debate, but it is clear 
that decreased fat accumulation improves insulin sensitivity and produces 
beneficial effects on overall metabolic health. Over the last 20 years, dietary 
methionine restriction (MR) has emerged as a promising DR mimetic because it 
produces a comparable extension in life span, but surprisingly, does not require 
food restriction. Dietary MR also reduces adiposity but does so through a 
paradoxical increase in both energy intake and expenditure. The increase in 
energy expenditure fully compensates for increased energy intake and effectively 
limits fat deposition. Perhaps more importantly, the diet increases metabolic 
flexibility and overall insulin sensitivity and improves lipid metabolism while 
decreasing systemic inflammation. In this chapter, we describe recent advances 
in our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of dietary MR and discuss the 
remaining obstacles to implementing MR as a treatment for metabolic disease.

Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

AIM: When treating patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC), the choice 
between escalating medical management or surgery can be difficult. The aim of 
this study was to quantify the preferences of patients and clinicians for the 
treatment options in UC.
METHOD: Ulcerative colitis outpatients were interviewed to measure their 
preferences for five scenarios examining the management of acute and chronic UC, 
using a prospective measure of preference method that generates two utility 
scores: willingness and amount of expected life to trade or gamble. A 
self-administered questionnaire was mailed to Australian and New Zealand 
colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (26 medical and 29 surgical), 91 surgeons and 78 
gastroenterologists were surveyed. In the acute setting, 89% of patients, 69% of 
gastroenterologists and 55% of surgeons were willing to trade part of their life 
expectancy to avoid a permanent stoma, while for chronic disease 71% of patients 
were prepared to trade to avoid an operation with a permanent stoma compared 
with 55% for an operation with a pouch (P = 0.01). Both patients and 
gastroenterologists were more prepared to gamble or trade to avoid any surgery 
than were colorectal surgeons. All groups were aligned in their decision to 
undergo yearly colonoscopy surveillance rather than to undergo definitive 
surgery that would result in a stoma.
CONCLUSION: Patient preferences for the treatment of UC were more aligned to 
those of gastroenterologists than those of colorectal surgeons. Despite 
postoperative studies revealing an equal quality of life for pouch and stoma 
patients, this study confirmed that a pouch is the preferred surgical option.

BACKGROUND: While primary immunodeficiencies (PID has been recognized in the 
west for decades, recognition has been delayed in the third world. This study 
attempts to detail the spectrum of PID, the therapy provided, and constraints in 
the diagnosis and treatment in a middle income country such as Sri Lanka.
METHODS: Nine hundred and forty two patients with recurrent infections and 
features suggestive of immune deficiency, referred from the entire country in a 
4 year period, to the sole immunology unit in Sri Lanka were included. The 
following tests were performed. Full blood counts, serum Immunoglobulin and 
complement C3 and C4 levels, functional antibody levels, enumeration of 
lymphocyte subsets, in vitro and in vivo T cell functional assays,, nitroblue 
tetrazolium assay to diagnose chronic granulomatous disease, hair shaft assay to 
diagnose Griscelli syndrome. Sequencing of the common gamma chain to identify x 
linked severe combined immune deficiency, and X linked agammaglobulinemia was 
confirmed by assaying for Btk mutations by single sequence conformation 
polymorphism. HIV/AIDS was excluded in all patients.
RESULTS: Seventy three patients were diagnosed with a primary immune deficiency. 
The majority (60.27%) had antibody deficiency. Common variable immune deficiency 
was the commonest (28.76%), followed by X linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) 
(20.54%). Five patients had possible hyper IgM syndrome.Ten patients had severe 
combined immune deficiency (SCID), including 2 with x linked SCID, in addition 
to DiGeorge syndrome (2), ataxia telangiectasia (6), autosomal dominant hyper 
IgE syndrome (2), chronic granulomatous disease (4), leucocyte adhesion 
deficiency type 1 (2) and Griscelli syndrome (3).Patients with autoinflammatory, 
innate immune and complement defects could not be identified due to lack of 
facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibody deficiency is the commonest PID, as in the west.IgA 
deficiency is rare. Autoinflammatory diseases, innate immune and complement 
deficiencies could not be identified due to lack of diagnostic facilities. Lack 
of awareness of PID among adult physicians result in delay in treatment of adult 
patients. While treatment of antibody deficiencies provided in state hospitals 
has extended life expectancy, there is no treatment available for severe T cell 
defects.

A number of stated preferences studies have estimated a monetary value for the 
gains in life expectancy resulting from pollution control, using a Value of a 
Life Year (VOLY) approach. However, life expectancy gains are a complex concept 
and no attempt has been made, to date, to investigate peoples' understanding of 
what it is they are being asked to value. Past practice has been to focus on the 
outcome of a policy i.e. a gain to the average person of X months', providing no 
details on how the individual receives, or experiences this gain, a potentially 
important attribute to value. This paper sets up and reports the results from a 
structured debriefing exercise to qualitatively investigate an alternative 
approach which explicitly emphasises how this gain is delivered (on-going 
reductions in the risk of death). We find that, for the majority of respondents, 
the approach is effective in communicating the on-going nature of the gain and 
reduces or eliminates the use of the (incorrect) heuristic that it is an 
'add-on' at the end of life, in poor health. Further refinements are required, 
however, to communicate the cumulative nature of these risk reductions and the 
lack of impact on quality of life. The lesson for stated preference studies in 
general is that structured debriefings can be very useful, highlighting such 
issues as the persistence of ill-defined attributes and the difficulties that 
respondents may encounter setting aside their preferences over attributes of the 
good that should not be included in the valuation.

Demographic data from wild chimpanzees are of considerable interest for 
understanding the evolution of the human life history. Published mortality data, 
however, come primarily from chimpanzee populations that have recently suffered 
dramatic, human-induced declines, and exhibit rates of reproduction well below 
replacement. Here we present a life table for chimpanzees living in the 
Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, comprising 1129 individual risk 
years and 56 deaths. This community has shown modest growth over the past 25 
years, avoiding some of the worst impacts of human contact. Sex differences in 
mortality at Kanyawara appeared similar to those reported from other sites. 
However, overall mortality rates were significantly lower than those reported 
from the long-term study sites of Gombe, Taï and Mahale. Kanyawara chimpanzees 
in this sample had a life expectancy at birth of 19 years, and individuals 
living to age 14 could expect to live for another 24 years. Life table data from 
Kanyawara indicate a mean mortality rate of 3.9% per year over the ages of 
10-35, substantially less than the equivalent figure of 6.8% from a sample of 
other long-term chimpanzee study sites. The comparable adult mortality rate from 
a range of human foraging societies is ∼2%. The Kanyawara data thus suggest an 
important downward revision in adult mortality rates for wild chimpanzees, but 
they do not challenge the existence of an important difference in adult 
mortality between humans and chimpanzees.

BACKGROUND: The United States has a culturally and demographically diverse 
populace, and the aim of this study was to examine differences in health 
preferences by sex, age, ethnicity, and race.
METHODS: We assessed preferences for health outcomes defined by the PROMIS-29 
survey in a sample of the US population. On the basis of the survey's 540 
paired-comparisons trading off lifespan and 7 domains of health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL), we compared the choices between men and women, adults age 18-54 
years and 55 years and older, Hispanics and non-Hispanics, and non-Hispanic 
blacks and whites. For each subgroup, we estimated the value of 122 HRQoL 
outcomes on a quality-adjusted life year scale and tested for subgroup 
differences.
RESULTS: Compared with men, women preferred reduced lifespan over losses in 
HRQoL, particularly for depression. Compared with the younger adults, older 
adults preferred reduced lifespan over the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and 
fatigue. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics preferred reduced lifespan 
over depression and sleep disturbance, but held similar values on losses in 
physical functioning. Among non-Hispanics, blacks preferred reduced lifespan 
over losses in ability to climb stairs and to fall asleep compared with whites, 
but held similar values on mental health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: With the growing emphasis on patient-centeredness and culturally 
sensitive treatment, it is important to recognize the diversity in values placed 
on potential losses in HRQoL, particularly mental health outcomes. Demographic 
differences in preferences may influence comparative or cost effectiveness of 
treatments as perceived by one or another subgroup.

OBJECTIVES: We estimate (a) probabilities of moving to and from long-term 
institutional care and probabilities of death and (b) life expectancy in the 
community and in care by gender and marital status.
METHOD: A 40% random sample of Finns aged 65+ at the end of 1997 (n = 301,263) 
drawn from the population register was linked with register-based information on 
sociodemographic characteristics, entry and exit dates for long-term 
institutional care, and dates of death in 1998-2003. Probabilities and life 
expectancies were estimated using multistate life tables.
RESULTS: At age 65, women are expected to spend more of their remaining lifetime 
in institutions than men (1.6 and 0.7 years, respectively). These care 
expectancies remain similar even for survivors to very advanced ages. Gender 
differences are driven by women's higher chances of entering institutions at 
ages above 80 years and lower chances of exit. At age 65, 59% of women and 36% 
of men will ever enter long-term institutions. The married spend less of their 
longer life expectancy in institutions than the non-married. The large gender 
difference in care use exists within each marital status group.
DISCUSSION: The resources that are needed to provide long-term care services 
will increase as age of death increases. We demonstrate significantly longer 
care expectancy among women and among the unmarried.

Telomeres maintain chromosome stability and cell replicative capacity. Telomere 
shortening occurs concomitant with aging. Short telomeres are associated with 
some diseases, such as dyskeratosis congenita, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 
and aplastic anemia. Telomeres are longer in pluripotent stem cells than in 
somatic cells and lengthen significantly during preimplantation development. 
Furthermore, telomere elongation during somatic cell reprogramming is of great 
importance in the acquisition of authentic pluripotency. This review focuses 
primarily on regulatory mechanisms of telomere length maintenance in pluripotent 
cells, telomere length extension in early embryo development, and also telomere 
rejuvenation in somatic cell reprogramming. Telomere related diseases are also 
discussed in this review.

INTRODUCTION: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term 
safety/tolerability of atomoxetine in Japanese adults with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: This 48-week, open-label extension study involved participants with 
ADHD who completed a 10-week randomized controlled trial of atomoxetine. 
Participants received atomoxetine 40 mg/day, followed by step-wise titration to 
a maximum of 120 mg/day. The primary outcome was safety/tolerability. Secondary 
outcomes were symptoms of ADHD (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales-Investigator 
Rated: Screening Version 18-item total score), quality of life (Adult 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Quality of Life scale), and executive 
function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version: 
Self-report).
RESULTS: Of the 39.5% of participants overall who discontinued the study, 15.9% 
(37/233) of participants discontinued because of adverse events (AEs), primarily 
nausea (4.3%; 10/233). Overall, 93.6% (218/233) of participants experienced 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), most commonly nausea (56.2%; 131/233), 
nasopharyngitis (25.3%; 59/233), thirst (19.3%; 45/233), headache (17.2%; 
40/233), and decreased appetite (16.3%; 38/233). Most TEAEs (70.8%; 165/233) 
were mild in intensity. Overall, 79.8% (186/233) of participants experienced ≥1 
adverse drug reaction, primarily nausea (55.4%; 129/233). Five participants 
experienced serious AEs during the open-label extension; none was 
related/possibly related to treatment. There were statistically significant 
increases in vital signs and decreases in body weight that were not considered 
clinically significant. Symptoms of ADHD, quality of life, and executive 
function were significantly improved from baseline to endpoint (P < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Despite discontinuations due to the long-term, open-label design, AE 
related discontinuations were modest, suggesting that atomoxetine has acceptable 
long-term safety and tolerability in Japanese adults with ADHD. Symptoms of ADHD 
improved and remained improved throughout the study.

The aim of the present study is to assess functional outcomes after 
hemiglossectomy and microvascular reconstruction. Twenty-six patients underwent 
primary tongue microvascular reconstruction after hemiglossectomy. Twelve 
patients were reconstructed using a free radial forearm flap and 14 with an 
anterolateral thigh flap. Speech intelligibility, swallowing capacity and 
quality of life scores were assessed. Factors such as tumour extension, surgical 
resection and adjuvant radiotherapy appeared to be fundamental to predict 
post-treatment functional outcomes. The data obtained in the present study 
indicate that swallowing capacity after hemiglossectomy is better when an 
anterolateral thigh flap is used. No significant differences were seen for 
speech intelligibility or quality of life between free radial forearm flap and 
anterolateral thigh flap.

Publisher: Lo scopo del presente studio è di valutare i risultati funzionali 
delle ricostruzioni linguali microvascolari in seguito ad emiglossectomia. Venti 
sei pazienti sono stati sottoposti a ricostruzione microvascolare primaria. 
Dodici di questi sono stati ricostruiti usando il lembo libero radiale e 
quattordici usando il lembo anterolaterale di coscia. L'intellegibilità del 
linguaggio, la capacità deglutitoria e la qualità della vita sono stati i 
parametri considerati nella valutazione dei risultati. Variabili legate 
all'estensione del tumore, alla resezione chirurgica ed al trattamento adiuvante 
sono risultati essere fondamenti nel predire i risultati funzionali 
post-operatori. I dati ottenuti da tale studio hanno mostrato come la capacità 
deglutitoria sia sensibilmente migliore nelle ricostruzioni con il lembo libero 
anterolaterale di coscia rispetto al lembo radiale. Non altrettanto 
significative sono risultate le differenze tra le due modalità ricostruttive per 
quanto riguarda l'intellegibilità del linguaggio.

BACKGROUND: Prior to 1970, coal mining technology and prevention measures in 
China were poor. Mechanized coal mining equipment and advanced protection 
measures were continuously installed in the mines after 1970. All these 
improvements may have resulted in a change in the incidence of coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis (CWP). Therefore, it is important to identify the characteristics 
of CWP today and trends for the incidence of CWP in the future.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 17,023 coal workers from the Kailuan 
Colliery Group were studied. A life-table method was used to calculate the 
cumulative incidence rate of CWP and predict the number of new CWP patients in 
the future. The probability of developing CWP was estimated by a multilayer 
perceptron artificial neural network for each coal worker without CWP. The 
results showed that the cumulative incidence rates of CWP for tunneling, mining, 
combining, and helping workers were 31.8%, 27.5%, 24.2%, and 2.6%, respectively, 
during the same observation period of 40 years. It was estimated that there 
would be 844 new CWP cases among 16,185 coal workers without CWP within their 
life expectancy. There would be 273.1, 273.1, 227.6, and 69.9 new CWP patients 
in the next <10, 10-, 20-, and 30- years respectively in the study cohort within 
their life expectancy. It was identified that coal workers whose risk 
probabilities were over 0.2 were at high risk for CWP, and whose risk 
probabilities were under 0.1 were at low risk.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The present and future incidence trends of CWP remain 
high among coal workers. We suggest that coal workers at high risk of CWP 
undergo a physical examination for pneumoconiosis every year, and the coal 
workers at low risk of CWP be examined every 5 years.

AIM: To evaluate the outcome of prostate cancer patients with initial PSA value 
>40 ng/ml.
BACKGROUND: The outcome of prostate cancer patients with very high initial PSA 
value is not known and patients are frequently treated with palliative intent. 
We analyzed the outcome of radical combined hormonal treatment and radiotherapy 
in prostate cancer patients with initial PSA value >40 ng/ml.
METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2007 we treated, with curative 
intent, 56 patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer and initial PSA value 
>40 ng/ml. The treatment consisted of two months of neoadjuvant hormonal 
treatment (LHRH analog), radical radiotherapy (68-78 Gy, conformal technique) 
and an optional two-year adjuvant hormonal treatment.
RESULTS: The median time of follow up was 61 months. 5-Year overall survival was 
90%. 5-Year biochemical disease free survival was 62%. T stage, Gleason score, 
PSA value, and radiotherapy dose did not significantly influence the outcome. 
Late genitourinal and gastrointestinal toxicity was acceptable.
CONCLUSION: Radical treatment in combination with hormonal treatment and 
radiotherapy can be recommended for this subgroup of prostate cancer patients 
with good performance status and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The current diagnostic strategy using transrectal ultrasound-guided 
biopsy (TRUSGB) raises concerns regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of 
prostate cancer (PCa). Interest in integrating multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance-guided biopsy (MRGB) into the 
diagnostic pathway to reduce overdiagnosis and improve grading is gaining 
ground, but it remains uncertain whether this image-based strategy is 
cost-effective.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of multiparametric MRI and MRGB 
compared with TRUSGB.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A combined decision tree and Markov model for 
men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (>4 ng/ml) was developed. Input data 
were derived from systematic literature searches, meta-analyses, and expert 
opinion.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and health care costs of both strategies were modelled over 10 yr after 
initial suspicion of PCa. Probabilistic and threshold analyses were performed to 
assess uncertainty.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Despite uncertainty around the presented 
cost-effectiveness estimates, our results suggest that the MRI strategy is 
cost-effective compared with the standard of care. Expected costs per patient 
were € 2423 for the MRI strategy and € 2392 for the TRUSGB strategy. 
Corresponding QALYs were higher for the MRI strategy (7.00 versus 6.90), 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 323 per QALY. 
Threshold analysis revealed that MRI is cost-effective when sensitivity of MRGB 
is ≥ 20%. The probability that the MRI strategy is cost-effective is around 80% 
at willingness to pay thresholds higher than € 2000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Total costs of the MRI strategy are almost equal with the standard 
of care, while reduction of overdiagnosis and overtreatment with the MRI 
strategy leads to an improvement in quality of life.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared costs and quality of life (QoL) of the standard 
"blind" diagnostic technique with an image-based technique for men with 
suspicion of prostate cancer. Our results suggest that costs were comparable, 
with higher QoL for the image-based technique.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable paralytic disorder primarily 
typified by the selective and progressive degeneration of motoneurons in the 
brain and spinal cord. ALS causes muscle wasting and atrophy, resulting 
eventually in respiratory failure and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. 
Vitamin D is a potent secosteroid hormone with diverse biological functions that 
include protection against neuronal damage. The detrimental consequences of 
vitamin D dietary deficiency have been documented in other neurodegenerative 
diseases. However, the protective effect of vitamin D on motoneuron and the 
influence of its levels on disease course remains elusive. Here we found that 
the biologically active form of vitamin D significantly potentiated the effect 
of neurotrophic factors and prevented motoneurons from a Fas-induced death, 
while electrophysiological properties of motoneurons were not affected. In ALS 
patients, we report that a severe vitamin D deficiency accelerates by 4 times 
the rate of decline and were associated with a marked shorter life expectancy. 
Our findings support a neuroprotective function of vitamin D on motoneurons and 
propose vitamin D as a reliable prognostic factor of ALS.

Dose tracking and rational examination selection for the medically-exposed 
population.

Tracking the radiation dose to medically-exposed populations can promote 
adoption of best practices among medical facilities that use ionizing radiation. 
Dose index registries provide an important tool for practices to benchmark their 
radiation doses for medical imaging and highlight areas where improvements may 
be made. However, individual patient dose tracking has many confounding 
variables to consider. It is not clear which dose measures should be tracked, 
and the variation among these dose measures must be understood relative to the 
variations in body habitus that are encountered in clinical practice. In 
addition, there are many uncertainties associated with risk estimation from 
low-dose radiation that relate to the age, gender, and life expectancy of the 
exposed individual. Other sources of variation in the use of ionizing radiation 
for medical imaging are of concern. Specifically, deviation from best practice 
in the use of medical imaging should be reduced, if not eliminated. Several 
tools exist to help reduce variation among practices when it comes to rational 
examination selection. Computerized order entry with decision support offers the 
promise to introduce these tools at the point of care, which should increase 
their use and adoption in the medical community at large.Introduction of Dose 
Tracking and Rational Exam Selection (Video 1:59, http://links.lww.com/HP/A33).

Impact on the Japanese atomic bomb survivors of radiation received from the 
bombs.

Hijiyama Park, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 732-0815, Japan.

The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) studies various cohorts of 
Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the largest being the Life Span Study (LSS), 
which includes 93,741 persons who were in Hiroshima or Nagasaki at the times of 
the bombings; there are also cohorts of persons who were exposed in utero and 
survivors' children. This presentation attempts to summarize the total impact of 
the radiation from the bombs on the survivors from both an individual 
perspective (both age-specific and integrated lifetime risk, along with a 
measure of life expectancy that describes how the risk affects the individual 
given age at exposure) and a group perspective (estimated numbers of excess 
occurrences in the cohort), including both early and late effects. As survivors' 
doses ranged well into the acutely lethal range at closer distances, some of 
them experienced acute signs and symptoms of radiation exposure in addition to 
being at risk of late effects. Although cancer has always been a primary concern 
among late effects, estimated numbers of excess cancers and hematopoietic 
malignancies in the LSS are a small fraction of the total due to the highly 
skewed dose distribution, with most survivors receiving small doses. For 
example, in the latest report on cancer incidence, 853 of 17,448 incident solid 
cancers were estimated to be attributable to radiation from the bombs. RERF 
research indicates that risk of radiation-associated cancer varies among sites 
and that some benign tumors such as uterine myoma are also associated with 
radiation. Noncancer late effects appear to be in excess in proportion to 
radiation dose but with an excess relative risk about one-third that of solid 
cancer and a correspondingly small overall fraction of cases attributable to 
radiation. Specific risks were found for some subcategories, particularly 
circulatory disease, including stroke and precedent conditions such as 
hypertension. Radiation-related cataract in the atomic bomb survivors is well 
known, with evidence in recent years of risk at lower dose levels than 
previously appreciated. In addition to somatic effects, survivors experienced 
psychosocial effects such as uncertainty, social stigma, or rejection, and other 
social pressures. Developmental deficits associated with in utero exposure, 
notably cognitive impairment, have also been described. Interaction of radiation 
with other risk factors has been demonstrated in relation to both cancer and 
noncancer diseases. Current research interests include whether radiation 
increases risk of diabetes or conditions of the eye apart from cataract, and 
there continues to be keen interest as to whether there are heritable effects in 
survivors' children, despite negative findings to date. Introduction of Impact
