INTRODUCTION: Acetabular fractures due to high energy injuries are common and 
well documented; those secondary to low energy mechanisms are less well 
described. We undertook a retrospective study of the acetabular fracture 
referrals to our unit to evaluate the proportion of injuries resulting from a 
low energy mechanism.
METHODS: A total of 573 acetabular fractures were evaluated from 1 January 2005 
to 31 December 2008. The plain radiography and computed tomography of those 
sustaining a low energy fracture were assessed and the fracture patterns 
classified.
RESULTS: Of the 573 acetabular fractures, 71 (12.4%) were recorded as being a 
result of a low energy mechanism. The male-to-female ratio was 2.4:1 and the 
mean patient age was 67.0 years (standard deviation: 19.1 years). There was a 
significantly higher number of fractures (p<0.001) involving the anterior column 
(with or without a posterior hemitransverse component) than in a number of 
previously conducted large acetabular fracture studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that low energy fractures make up a 
considerable proportion of acetabular fractures with a distinctly different 
fracture pattern distribution. With the continued predicted rise in the 
incidence of osteoporosis, life expectancy and an aging population, it is likely 
that this type of fracture will become increasingly more common, posing 
difficult management decisions and leading to procedures that are technically 
more challenging.

CONTEXT: Patients with advanced cancer need multiple drugs to control symptoms 
and to treat cancer and concomitant diseases. At the same time, the goal of 
treatment changes as life expectancy becomes limited. This results in a risk for 
polypharmacy, maintained use of unneeded drugs, and drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the use of medications and to 
identify unneeded drugs, and drugs and drug combinations with a risk for DDIs in 
a cohort of advanced cancer pain patients, defined by a need for a World Health 
Organization analgesic ladder Step III opioid.
METHODS: All drugs taken within a study day by cancer patients receiving opioids 
for moderate or severe pain (Step III opioids) were analyzed. Nonopioids and 
adjuvants were analyzed for their use across countries. Unneeded medications and 
drugs and drug combinations with a risk for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
DDIs were identified on the basis of published literature and electronic 
resources.
RESULTS: In total, 2282 patients from 17 centers in 11 European countries were 
included. They received a mean of 7.8 drugs (range 1-20). Over one-quarter used 
10 or more medications. The drugs and drug classes most frequently 
coadministered with opioids were proton pump inhibitors, laxatives, 
corticosteroids, paracetamol (acetaminophen), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, metoclopramide, benzodiazepines, anticoagulants, antibiotics, 
anticonvulsants, diuretics, and antidepressants. The use of nonopioids and 
essential adjuvants varied across countries. Approximately 45% of patients 
received unnecessary or potentially unnecessary drugs, and about 7% were given 
duplicate or antagonizing agents. Exposures to DDIs were frequent and increased 
the risk of sedation, gastric ulcerations, bleedings, and neuropsychiatric and 
cardiac complications. Many patients were exposed to pharmacokinetic DDIs 
involving cytochrome P450, including about 58% who used a Step III opioid CYP3A4 
(izoenzyme of cytochrome P450) substrate, and more than 10% who were given major 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.
CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer treated with a World Health Organization Step 
III opioid use a high number of drugs. Nonopioid analgesics and corticosteroids 
are frequently used, but different patterns of use between countries were found. 
Many patients receive unneeded drugs and are at risk of serious DDIs. These 
findings demonstrate that drug therapy in these patients needs to be evaluated 
continuously.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although the pathologic processes that affect the spine 
remain largely unchanged, our techniques to correct them continue to evolve with 
the development of novel medical and surgical interventions. Although the 
primary purpose of new technologies is to improve patients' quality of life, the 
economic impact of such therapies must be considered.
PURPOSE: To review the available peer-reviewed literature on spine surgery that 
addresses the cost-effectiveness of various treatments and technologies.
STUDY DESIGN: A narrative literature review.
METHODS: Articles published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012 were 
selected from two Pubmed searches using keywords cost-effectiveness AND spine 
(216 articles) and cost analysis AND spine (358 articles). Relevant articles on 
cost analyses and cost-effectiveness were selected by the authors and reviewed.
RESULTS: Cervical and lumbar surgeries (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, 
standard open lumbar discectomy, and standard posterior lumbar laminectomy) are 
reasonably cost effective at 2 years after the procedure (<100,000 US dollars 
per quality-adjusted life years gained) and become more cost effective with time 
because of sustained clinical improvements with relatively low additional 
incurred costs. The usage of transfusion avoidance technology is not cost 
effective because of the low risk of complications associated with allogenic 
transfusions. Although intraoperative neuromonitoring and imaging modalities are 
both cost saving and cost-effective, their cost-effectiveness is largely 
dependent on the baseline rate of neurologic complications and implant 
misplacement, respectively. More rigorous studies are needed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of recombinant bone morphogenetic protein.
CONCLUSIONS: An ideal new technology should be able to achieve maximal 
improvement in patient health at a cost that society is willing to pay. The 
cost-effectiveness of technologies and treatments in spine care is dependent on 
their durability and the rate and severity of the baseline clinical problem that 
the treatment was designed to address.

The mission of the National Institutes of Health,"... is science in pursuit of 
fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the 
application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce 
illness and disability". A wide range of factors contribute to longer life and 
to less illness. Although estimates vary, most analyses suggest that only about 
10% of the variation in health outcome is attributable to medical care. Further, 
medical care is most effective in addressing and preventing infectious disease 
and acute illnesses. Recent large randomized clinical trials often fail to 
demonstrate that medical care lengthens life expectancy. International 
comparisons suggest that life expectancy in the United States is increasing, but 
the rate of increase is falling behind that of other wealthy countries. 
Strategies for improving health outcomes include better dissemination and 
implementation of proven evidence-based interventions. Further, reduction of 
services that use resources but do not offer health benefits must be considered. 
The final section of this paper reviews evidence relevant to factors outside the 
health care system that may enhance life expectancy and reduce illness and the 
disability. The relationship between educational attainment and life expectancy 
is used as a case example. The potential of behavioral and social interventions 
for increasing life expectancy may be orders of magnitude greater than 
traditional medial interventions. However, considerably more research is 
necessary in order to provide persuasive evidence for the benefits of these 
programs.

Early benefit assessment aims to prove a benefit of a new pharmaceutical over 
the appropriate comparator based on patient-relevant endpoints. In addition to 
mortality and morbidity, quality of life is a patient-relevant endpoint. Thus, 
phase III clinical trials are the basis of evidence. But HTA and health 
authorities attach different importance to quality of life. Using the example of 
oncology, the challenges with study design and analysis will be discussed. A 
particular challenge to the analysis of quality-of-life data is varying 
observation times in treatment arms with different effectiveness. Based on the 
example of Crizotinib possible solutions will be presented.

Measuring health-related quality of life is an important aspect in economic 
evaluation of health programmes. The development of utility-based 
(preference-based) measures is advanced by the discipline of health economics. 
Different preference measures are applied for valuing health states to produce a 
weighted health state index. Those preference weights should be derived from a 
general population sample in case of resource allocation on a collective level 
(as in current valuation studies of the EuroQol group).

BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty and revision surgery is growing exponentially in 
OECD countries, but rates vary between countries.
METHODS: We extracted economic data and utilization rates data about hip 
arthroplasty done in OECD countries between 1990 and 2011. Absolute number of 
implantations and compound annual growth rates were computed per 100,000 
population and for patients aged 65 years old and over and for patients aged 64 
years and younger.
RESULTS: In the majority of OECD countries, there has been a significant 
increase in the utilization of total hip arthroplasty in the last 10 years, but 
rates vary to a great extent: In the United States, Switzerland, and Germany the 
utilization rate exceeds 200/100,000 population whereas in Spain and Mexico 
rates are 102 and 8, respectively. There is a strong correlation between gross 
domestic product (GDP) and health care expenditures per capita with utilization 
rate. Utilization rates in all age groups have continued to rise up to present 
day. A seven fold higher growth rate was seen in patients aged 64 years and 
younger as compared to older patients.
CONCLUSION: We observed a 38-fold variation in the utilization of hip 
arthroplasty among OECD countries, correlating with GDP and health care 
expenditures. Over recent years, there has been an increase in the utilization 
rate in most countries. This was particularly evident in the younger patients. 
Due to increasing life expectancy and the disproportionally high use of 
arthroplasty in younger patients we expect an exponential increase of revision 
rate in the future.

The experience of prostate cancer is for most men a major life stress with the 
psychological burden of this disease falling more heavily on those who are 
younger. Despite this, being young as it applies to prostate cancer is not yet 
clearly defined with varied chronological approaches applied. However, men's 
responses to health crises are closely bound to life course and masculinities 
from which social roles emerge. This paper applied qualitative methodology 
(structured focus groups and semistructured interviews with expert informants) 
using interpretative phenomenological analysis to define what it means to be 
young and have prostate cancer. Structured focus groups were held with 26 
consumer advisors (men diagnosed with prostate cancer who provide support to 
other men with prostate cancer or raise community awareness) and health 
professionals. As well, 15 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and in their 40s, 
50s, or 60s participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants discussed 
the attributes that describe a young man with prostate cancer and the experience 
of being young and diagnosed with prostate cancer. Chronological definitions of 
a young man were absent or inconsistent. Masculine constructions of what it 
means to be a young man and life course characteristics appear more relevant to 
defining young as it applies to prostate cancer compared with chronological age. 
These findings have implications for better understanding the morbidities 
associated with this illness, and in designing interventions that are oriented 
to life course and helping young men reconstruct their identities after prostate 
cancer.

In patients with inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA), palliative 
endoscopic or percutaneous drainage provides benefits in terms of symptomatic 
improvement and quality of life. Endoscopic biliary stent placement is 
considered the gold standard, with metal stents preferred over plastic stents in 
patients with more than three months of life expectancy. However, the endoscopic 
management of advanced hilar obstruction is often more challenging and complex 
than distal malignant biliary obstructions. Recently, the Asia-Pacific working 
group on hepatobiliary cancers produced consensus recommendations on the use of 
endoscopic vs. percutaneous drainage and unilateral vs. bilateral drainage in 
the management of HCCA. However, these guidelines must be weighed against 
context-specific information, such as the volume of liver drainage required, 
life expectancy of the patient, and the available expertise. In this literature 
review, we describe the issues commonly encountered during endoscopic biliary 
stenting for malignant hilar obstruction and provide technical guidance to 
improve success rates and patient outcomes.

America.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of education and chronic and/or infectious 
disease, and the interaction between both variables, on the risk of dying among 
Mexicans 60 years and older.
METHODS: Using data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), logistic 
regressions were performed to estimate the risk of mortality for older Mexicans 
between 2001 and 2003. Estimated mortality risks associated with chronic 
disease, infectious disease, and a combination of both were used to estimate 
additional life expectancy at age 60.
RESULTS: Compared to the group with some schooling, the probability of dying 
over the twoyear inter-wave period was 26% higher among those with no schooling. 
Not having at least one year of formal education translated into a shorter 
additional life expectancy at age 60 by 1.4-2.0 years. Having chronic and/or 
infectious disease also increased the risk of mortality during the same period
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 1) a mixed epidemiological regime (the 
presence of both chronic and infectious disease) adds to the mortality health 
burden experienced by older people, and 2) there are persistent inequalities in 
mortality risks based on socioeconomic status.

OBJECTIVE: Estimate the changes in life expectancy related to avoidable and 
nonavoidable deaths in Mexico between the three-year periods from 1998-2000 and 
2008-2010 by sex and age group.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Data from official 
sources on deaths recorded from 0-74 years of age and population estimates 
(Mexican and worldwide) for the three-year periods from 1998-2000 and 2008-2010 
was used. The crude and standardized death rates and years of life expectancy 
lost in the periods studied were calculated. Estimates were made of the effect 
of avoidable and non-avoidable deaths on life expectancy from 0-74 years of age, 
using the Arriaga method, and temporary life expectancy by age group.
RESULTS: Mortality due to avoidable causes increased by 2.1% whereas mortality 
related to non-avoidable causes decreased by 2.3%, with differences according to 
sex. Life expectancy at birth was 74.2 years in the three-year period from 
1998-2000 and 75.1 years in the three-year period from 2008-2010. Temporary life 
expectancy from 0-74 years of age remained nearly the same at about 68.6 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Years of life expectancy can be gained through actions that promote 
health and disease prevention, mainly by reducing deaths due to avoidable 
causes. Cross-sectional population-based interventions and strategies should be 
developed, focusing on specific subgroups, from a gender and generational 
perspective, and adjusted for the specific geographical, socioeconomic, and 
cultural features of the target population.

Increased rates of duodenal obstruction in pancreatic cancer patients receiving 
modern medical management.

Shah A(1), Fehmi A, Savides TJ.

California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, shahar3682@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Duodenal obstruction from pancreatic cancer historically occurs in 
2-25 % of patients without surgery, but with new advances in chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy, the life expectancy of pancreatic cancer has increased.
AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the rate of development of duodenal 
obstruction requiring intervention in patients with pancreatic head 
adenocarcinoma who do not undergo surgical resection, but receive modern 
chemoradiation.
METHODS: It is a retrospective single center study. Inclusion criteria were 
patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent ERCP with metal biliary stent and 
then chemoradiation who subsequently developed symptomatic duodenal obstruction 
and underwent either metal duodenal stent placement or surgical duodenal bypass.
RESULTS: Twenty-four of 63 patients (38 %, 95 % CI 26-50 %) with unresectable 
pancreatic cancer and biliary stents who received chemotherapy and/or radiation 
therapy developed duodenal obstruction. The average length of time from 
diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to development of outlet obstruction was 
11.4 ± 4.9 months (range 1.5-40 months). Average length of time from development 
of duodenal obstruction to death was 4.8 ± 2.1 months (range 0.5-60 months). 
Average survival time from diagnosis to death was 16.6 ± 5.6 months (range 
4.5-58 months).
CONCLUSION: Thirty-eight percent of patients with unresectable pancreatic head 
adenocarcinoma and metal biliary stents who receive chemotherapy and/or 
radiation therapy eventually develop symptomatic duodenal obstruction requiring 
duodenal stent or surgical bypass. This rate of duodenal obstruction is nearly 
twice that of previous reports using older oncologic therapy and will likely 
increase as patients survive longer with advances in medical therapy for 
pancreatic cancer.

Survival following primary androgen deprivation therapy for localized 
intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer: comparison with the life expectancy 
of the age-matched normal population.

The representative guidelines do not recommend androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) as a primary treatment for localized prostate cancer. However, in clinical 
practice, the use of primary ADT for localized prostate cancer has been 
widespread, especially among older patients. We performed a retrospective review 
of the efficacy of primary ADT for localized prostate cancer and compared their 
outcomes with the life expectancy of the normal population. The study cohort 
consisted of 410 men diagnosed with localized intermediate- or high-risk 
prostate cancer over the period 1992-2012 at five institutions. All patients 
underwent ADT as a primary cancer therapy, and mean follow-up was 6.0 years. 
Their progression-free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and 
overall survival (OS) rates were calculated. Patients' expected survival rates 
were estimated by the Hakulinen method. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that 
Gleason score ≥8 and cT3a were independent risk factors for all of PFS, CSS, and 
OS. In patients who have none or one of these risk factors, minimum OS rates 
were not inferior to the expected survival curves of the normal population. 
Meanwhile, in patients with both risk factors, the OS curve fell below the 
expected survival rates, especially after 6 years of follow-up. We conclude that 
primary ADT might be one of the therapeutic options for localized intermediate- 
and high-risk prostate cancer. However, for high-risk cases with Gleason score 
≥8 and cT3a, the choice of primary ADT should be deliberated carefully because 
the OS of these cases was inferior to the expected survival, especially at a 
late time point.

Neutrophil responses are central to host protection and inflammation. Neutrophil 
activation follows a 2-step process in which priming amplifies responses to 
activating stimuli. Priming is essential for life span extension, chemotaxis, 
and respiratory burst activity. Here we show that the cytoskeletal organizer 
RhoA suppresses neutrophil priming via formins. Premature granule exocytosis in 
Rho-deficient neutrophils activated numerous signaling pathways and amplified 
superoxide generation. Deletion of Rho altered front-to-back coordination by 
simultaneously increasing uropod elongation, leading edge formation, and random 
migration. Concomitant negative and positive regulation of β2 
integrin-independent and β2 integrin-dependent migration, respectively, reveal 
Rho as a key decision point in the neutrophil response to discrete chemotactic 
agents. Although even restricted influx of Rho-deficient hyperactive neutrophils 
exacerbated lipopolysaccharide-mediated lung injury, deleting Rho in innate 
immune cells was highly protective in influenza A virus infection. Hence, Rho is 
a key regulator of disease progression by maintaining neutrophil quiescence and 
suppressing hyperresponsiveness.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of the burden of disease in adults in sub-Saharan Africa 
largely rely on models of sparse data. We aimed to measure the burden of disease 
in adults living in a rural area of coastal Kenya with use of linked clinical 
and demographic surveillance data.
METHODS: We used data from 18,712 adults admitted to Kilifi District Hospital 
(Kilifi, Kenya) between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2012, linked to 790,635 
person-years of observation within the Kilifi Health and Demographic 
Surveillance System, to establish the rates and major causes of admission to 
hospital. These data were also used to model disease-specific 
disability-adjusted life-years lost in the population. We used geographical 
mapping software to calculate admission rates stratified by distance from the 
hospital.
FINDINGS: The main causes of admission to hospital in women living within 5 km 
of the hospital were infectious and parasitic diseases (303 per 100,000 
person-years of observation), pregnancy-related disorders (239 per 100,000 
person-years of observation), and circulatory illnesses (105 per 100,000 
person-years of observation). Leading causes of hospital admission in men living 
within 5 km of the hospital were infectious and parasitic diseases (169 per 
100,000 person-years of observation), injuries (135 per 100,000 person-years of 
observation), and digestive system disorders (112 per 100,000 person-years of 
observation). HIV-related diseases were the leading cause of disability-adjusted 
life-years lost (2050 per 100,000 person-years of observation), followed by 
non-communicable diseases (741 per 100,000 person-years of observation). For 
every 5 km increase in distance from the hospital, all-cause admission rates 
decreased by 11% (95% CI 7–14) in men and 20% (17–23) in women. The magnitude of 
this decline was highest for endocrine disorders in women (35%; 95% CI 22–46) 
and neoplasms in men (30%; 9–45).
INTERPRETATION: Adults in rural Kenya face a combined burden of infectious 
diseases, pregnancy-related disorders, cardiovascular illnesses, and injuries. 
Disease burden estimates based on hospital data are affected by distance from 
the hospital, and the amount of underestimation of disease burden differs by 
both disease and sex.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem 
with increasing incidence and prevalence and associated expenses.
OBJECTIVES: To explore different perceptions of rural and urban patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) about kidney transplant.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted four focus groups, each including 5 or 6 
patients with stage 5 CKD or end stage renal disease living in a rural or urban 
area. Open-ended questions probed patient familiarity with kidney transplant, 
perceptions of benefits of kidney transplant, perceived barriers to kidney 
transplant, and views about living donation. All the sessions were recorded and 
professionally transcribed. Responses were pooled, de-identified, and analyzed 
using qualitative thematic content analysis.
RESULTS: Urban patients were more likely to receive supplementary information 
and being strongly encouraged by their nephrologists to seek transplant. All 
participants acknowledged "independence" as the main advantage of 
transplantation. Increased freedom to travel and improved life expectancy were 
mentioned only among the urban groups. The main themes in all groups regarding 
perceived barriers to transplant were the tedious pre-transplant testing and 
workup expenses. Among rural groups, there was a perception that distance from 
transplant centers impedes transplant evaluation. Religious reasons favoring and 
opposing transplant were mentioned by participants in a rural group. Some 
members contended that since illness is God's will, we should not change it. 
Others in the same group argued that "God is not ready for us to give up". 
Praise and gratitude for the living donor were expressed in all groups, but 
concerns about donor's outcome were discussed only within the rural groups. In 
discussing preference about known or anonymous donors, members of an urban group 
mentioned favoring an anonymous donor, citing unease with a sense of life-long 
indebtedness.
CONCLUSIONS: Observed differences in perceptions among rural and urban patients 
about aspects of transplant may contribute to geographic disparities in 
transplant. The findings could be helpful to guide future individualized, 
culturally sensitive educational interventions about transplant for patients 
with CKD.

Biomarkers of oxidative stress and cataract. Novel drug delivery therapeutic 
strategies targeting telomere reduction and the expression of telomerase 
activity in the lens epithelial cells with N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye 
drops: anti-cataract which helps to prevent and treat cataracts in the eyes of 
dogs and other animals.

Babizhayev MA, Yegorov YE.

Cataracts in small animals are shown to be at least partially caused by 
oxidative damage to lens epithelial cells (LECs) and the internal lens; 
biomarkers of oxidative stress in the lens are considered as general biomarkers 
for life expectancy in the canine and other animals. Telomeres lengths and 
expressed telomerase activity in canine LECs may serve as important monitors of 
oxidative damage in normal LECs with documented higher levels of telomerase 
activity in cataractous LECs during cells' lifespan. Loss of functional telomere 
length below a critical threshold in LECs of canines during the effect of UV and 
chronic oxidative stress or metabolic failure, can activate programs leading to 
LEC senescence or death. Telomerase is induced in LECs of canines at critical 
stages of cataractogenesis initiation and exposure to oxidative stress through 
the involvement of catalytically active prooxidant transition metal (iron) ions. 
This work documents that transition metal ions (such as, ferrous ions- catalytic 
oxidants) might induce premature senescence in LECs of canines, telomere 
shortening with increased telomerase activity as adaptive response to UV light, 
oxidative and metabolic stresses. The therapeutic treatment with 1% 
N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) prodrug delivery is beneficial for prevention and 
dissolution of ripe cataracts in canines. This biological activity is based on 
the findings of ferroxidase activity pertinent to the dipeptide carnosine 
released ophthalmically from NAC prodrug of L-carnosine, stabilizing properties 
of carnosine on biological membranes based on the ability of the 
imidazole-containing dipeptides to interact with lipid peroxidation products and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), to prevent membrane damage and delute the 
associated with membrane fragements protein aggregates. The advent of 
therapeutic treatment of cataracts in canines with N-acetylcarnosine lubricant 
eye drops through targeting the prevention of loss of functional telomere length 
below a critical threshold and "flirting" with an indirect effect with 
telomerase expression in LECs of canines during the effects of UV, chronic 
oxidative stress increases the successful rate of cataract management challenges 
in home veterinary care.

It is known that mortality of Jews is different from the mortality of the 
populations that surround them. However, the existence of commonalities in 
mortality of different Jewish communities across the world has not received 
scholarly attention. This paper aims to identify common features of the 
evolution of Jewish mortality among Jews living in Israel and the Diaspora. In 
the paper the mortality of Jews in Israel is systematically compared with the 
mortality of the populations of developed countries, and the findings from the 
earlier studies of mortality of Jews in selected Diaspora communities are 
re-examined. The outcome is a re-formulation and extension of the notion of the 
'Jewish pattern of mortality'. The account of this pattern is based on the 
consistently low level of behaviourally induced mortality, the migration history 
of Jewish populations and the enduring influence of early-life conditions on 
mortality at older ages.

BACKGROUND: we aimed to recap and highlight the major results of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 by mortality and 
morbidity to clarify the current health priorities and challenges in Iran.
METHODS: We estimated Iran's mortality and burden of 289 diseases with 67 risk 
factors and 1160 sequelae, which were used to clinically present each disease 
and its disability or cause of death. We produced several measures to report 
health loss and status: all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, years of 
life lost due to death (YLL), healthy years of life lost due to disability 
(YLD), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), life expectancy, and healthy life 
expectancy, for three time periods: 1990, 2005, and 2010.
RESULTS: We found out that life expectancy at birth was 71.6 years in men and 
77.8 years in women. Almost 350 thousand deaths occurred in both sexes and all 
age groups in 2010. In both males and females and all age groups, ischemic heart 
disease was the main cause of death, claiming about 90 thousand lives. The main 
contributors to DALYs were: ischemic heart disease (9.1%), low back pain (9.0%), 
road injuries (7.3%), and unipolar depressive disorders (6.3%). The main causes 
of death under 5 years of age included: congenital anomalies (22.4%), preterm 
birth complications (18.3%), and other neonatal disorders (13.5%). The main 
causes of death among 15 - 49 year olds in both sexes included: injuries (23.6%) 
and ischemic heart disease (12.7%) The highest rates of YLDs were observed among 
70+ year olds for both sexes (27,365 per 100,000), mainly due to low back pain, 
osteoarthritis, diabetes, falls, and major depressive disorder. The main risk 
factors to which deaths were attributable among children under 5 years included: 
suboptimal breast feeding, ambient PM pollution, tobacco smoking, and 
underweight. The most important risk factors among 15 to 49 year olds were: 
dietary risks, high blood pressure, high body mass index, physical inactivity, 
smoking, and ambient PM pollution. The pattern was similar among 50+ year olds.
CONCLUSION: Although non-communicable diseases had the greatest burden in 2010, 
the challenge of communicable and maternal diseases for health system is not 
over yet. Diet and physiological risk factors appear to be the most important 
targets for public health policy in Iran. Moreover, Iranians would greatly 
benefit from effective strategies to prevent injury and musculoskeletal 
disorders and expand mental care. Persistent improvement is possible by 
strengthening the health information system to monitor the population health and 
evaluate current programs.

BACKGROUND: Drawing on the results of the country-level Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 Study, we attempted to investigate the 
drivers of change in the healthcare system in terms of mortality and morbidity 
due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors for the two decades from 1990 to 
2010.
METHODS: We decomposed trends in mortality, cause of death, years of life lost 
due to disability, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), life expectancy, 
health-adjusted life expectancy, and risk factors into the contribution of total 
increase in population size, aging of the population, and changes in 
age-specific and sex-specific rates.
RESULTS: We observed a decrease in age-specific mortality rate for both sexes, 
with a higher rate for women. The ranking of causes of death and their 
corresponding number of years of life lost remained unchanged between 1990 and 
2010. However, the percentages of change indicate patterns of reduction for most 
causes, such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, 
stomach cancer, lower respiratory infections, and congenital anomalies. The 
number of years lost due to disability caused by diabetes and drug use disorders 
has significantly increased in the last two decades. Major causes of DALYs, such 
as injuries, interpersonal violence, and suicide, showed increasing trends, 
while rates of communicable diseases, neonatal disorders, and nutritional 
deficiencies have declined significantly. Life expectancy and health-adjusted 
life expectancy increased for both sexes by approximately 7 years, with the 
highest rate of increase pertaining to females over the age 30.
CONCLUSIONS: Time trend information presented in this paper can be used to 
evaluate problems and policies specific to medical conditions or risk factors. 
Despite recent improvements, implementing policies to reduce the number of 
deaths and years of life lost due to road traffic injury remains the highest 
priority for Iranian policymakers. Immediate action by Iranian researchers is 
required to match Iran's decreasing mortality rate due to liver and stomach 
cancers to a rate comparable to the global level. Prevention and treatment plans 
for mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and 
particularly drug use disorders, should be considered in reforms of the health, 
education, and judiciary systems in Iran.

BACKGROUND: Population health and disease profiles are diverse across Iran's 
neighboring countries. Borrowing the results of the country-level Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 Study (GBD 2010), we aim to compare 
Iran with 19 countries in terms of an important set of population health and 
disease metrics. These countries include those neighboring Iran and a few other 
countries from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
METHODS: We show the pattern of health transition across the comparator 
countries from 1990 through 2010. We use classic GBD metrics measured for the 
year 2010 to indicate the rank of Iran among these nations. The metrics include 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost as a result of 
premature death (YLLs), years of life lost due to disability (YLDs), 
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), and age-standardized death rate (ASD).
RESULTS: Considerable and uniform transition from communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional (CMMN) conditions to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
was seen between 1990 and 2010. On average, ischemic heart disease, lower 
respiratory infections, and road injuries were the three principal causes of 
YLLs, while low back pain and major depressive disorders were the top causes of 
YLDs in these countries. Iran ranked 13th in HALE and 12th in ASD. The function 
of Iran's health care, measured by DALYs, was somewhat in the middle of the HALE 
spectrum for the comparator countries. This intermediate position becomes rather 
highlighted when Afghanistan, as outlier, is taken out of the comparison.
CONCLUSION: Effective policies to reduce NCDs need to be formulated and 
implemented through an integrated health care system. Our comparison shows that 
Iran can learn from the experience of a number of these countries to devise and 
execute the required strategies.

Reporting risk, producing prejudice: how news reporting on obesity shapes 
attitudes about health risk, policy, and prejudice.

News reporting on research studies may influence attitudes about health risk, 
support for public health policies, or attitudes towards people labeled as 
unhealthy or at risk for disease. Across five experiments (N = 2123) we examined 
how different news framings of obesity research influence these attitudes. We 
exposed participants to either a control condition, a news report on a study 
portraying obesity as a public health crisis, a news report on a study 
suggesting that obesity may not be as much of a problem as previously thought, 
or an article discussing weight-based discrimination. Compared to controls, 
exposure to the public health crisis article did not increase perception of 
obesity-related health risks but did significantly increase the expression of 
antifat prejudice in four out of seven comparisons. Across studies, compared to 
controls, participants who read an article about weight-based discrimination 
were less likely to agree that overweight constitutes a public health crisis or 
to support various obesity policies. Effects of exposure to an article 
questioning the health risks associated with overweight and obesity were mixed. 
These findings suggest that news reports on the "obesity epidemic" - and, by 
extension, on public health crises commonly blamed on personal behavior - may 
unintentionally activate prejudice.
