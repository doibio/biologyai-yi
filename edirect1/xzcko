Advance directive (Ad) and Advance Care Planning (ACP), which do not usually 
include postmortem events. This study aims to create opportunities for Ad and 
ACP to include the postmortem period as a trigger for this awareness reform.
METHODS: We conducted an Ad/ACP enlightenment lecture, and a questionnaire 
survey pre- and post-lecture for the elderly in old New Town, which is known for 
its aging society. The questionnaire comprised 38 multiple-choice questions 
covering 6 themes assuming an advanced state of dementia.
RESULTS: There were 35 participants (7 men and 22 women) aged 40-89 years. 
Several people left during the lecture, making it difficult to capture the 
precise transformation effect with regard to changing of mind. However, the 
effect of enlightenment was identified as a result of the consciousness survey. 
A statistically significant change in consciousness occurred in response to 
social contribution after death. Furthermore, notably more people wanted 
emergency transportation compared to those wanting resuscitation and extension 
of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The medical treatment desired might vary over time. Even the desire 
for life extension may differ significantly among individuals. This survey 
indicated a divergent view between the general public and medical staff, 
regarding a series of medical actions. We must persistently promote 
opportunities for enlightenment in cooperation with the general public (i.e., 
the communities and families we serve).

AIM: In Japan, the Kihon checklist, which a useful part of the Comprehensive 
Geriatric Assessment (CGA), is performed using questionnaire. On the other hand, 
specific health checkup screens are available for some basic diseases, such as 
diabetes and dyslipidemia, which can cause stroke, the largest cause of 
long-term care need. However, to date, no report has compared CGA and health 
checkups in older people for their ability to predict healthy life expectancy; 
therefore, this study was undertaken to do that.
METHODS: Data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) 2010, a 
self-administered mail survey of independent people aged 65 years or older, were 
used. A total of 9,756 participants in six cities responded to the 
questionnaire, underwent a health check, and were followed up for 3 years.Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the 
eventual need for long-term care level 2 or more or death, adjusting for sex, 
age, drinking or smoking habits, educational years, and equivalent income. 
Explanatory variables in the Kihon checklist included seven risks, namely, 
general frailty, functional disability, malnutrition, oral dysfunction, 
seclusion, cognitive impairment, and depression, and in specific health 
checkups, 15 required items including metabolic syndrome.
RESULTS: The incident rate of long-term care level 2 or more or death was 
19.4/1,000 person-years. All risks in the Kihon checklist, excluding oral 
dysfunction, were significant (range of HRs: 1.44-3.63). Six items in the 
specific health checkups (urine protein, low BMI, AST, HDL, FPG, and HbA1c) were 
significant (range of HRs: 1.37-2.07). Metabolic syndrome was not significant 
(HR: 1.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, CGA performed using questionnaire predicts healthy life 
expectancy better than a health checkup based on a blood test.

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT) and wrist-extensor splints 
(WESs) are two commonly used methods in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. 
In this study, the efficacy of these two methods was compared.
METHODS: The study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled study. A 
total of 67 patients were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: 
group 1 received ESWT (32 patients) and group 2 received WES (35 patients). 
Patients in group 1 underwent four sessions of ESWT once every week. In each 
session, an ESWT device at 10-12 Hz, 2,000 pulses, and 1.6-1.8 bar pressure was 
used. Patients in group 2 used a wrist splint, holding the wrist at 30°-45° 
extension for 4 weeks. Patients were assessed for handgrip strength, pain at 
rest, pain while working, and quality of life. Data were collected before and 
after treatment (at weeks 4, 12, and 24). A visual analog scale was used to 
evaluate pain at rest and while working, a hand dynamometer for handgrip 
strength, subscales of the SF36 Health Survey to evaluate quality of life, and 
the Turkish version of the patient-rated tennis-elbow evaluation was used to 
evaluate functioning of the affected arm during various daily life activities.
RESULTS: In both ESWT and WES groups, although there were considerably 
significant improvements (P<0.001) in the parameters evaluated (pain at rest and 
while working, handgrip strength, Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, Nirschl 
score, and SF36 subscales) were observed at 4, 12, and 24 weeks compared to 
pretreatment values, there was no statistically significant difference between 
the two groups in terms of our evaluation parameters at the three time points 
(P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Both ESWT and WES applications were found to yield significantly 
superior results when compared to pretreatment values. In comparison of the two 
groups, on the other hand, there was no statistically significant difference.

The wide life expectancy gap between the old and new member states of the 
European Union is most strongly related to the high rate of premature mortality 
caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To learn more about the background of 
this gap, the relationship of socioeconomic status (SES) with CVD mortality, 
morbidity and the utilization of antihypertensive drugs was studied in Hungary, 
a Central-Eastern European country with an extremely high relative risk of 
premature CVD mortality. Risk analysis capabilities were used to estimate the 
relationships between SES, which was characterized by tertiles of a 
multidimensional composite indicator (the deprivation index) and CVD burden 
(mortality and morbidity) as well as the antihypertensive medications at the 
district level in Hungary. The excess risks caused by premature mortality from 
CVDs showed a strong correlation with deprivation using the Rapid Inquiry 
Facility. The distribution of prevalence values related to these diseases was 
found to be similar, but in the areas of highest deprivation, where the 
prevalence of chronic ischaemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases was 
found to be higher than the national average by 30 and 20%, the prevalence of 
hypertension exceeded the national average by only 4%. A linear association 
between the relative frequency of prescriptions/redemptions and deprivation for 
most antihypertensive drugs, except angiotensinogen receptor blockers, was 
shown. More intense screening for hypertension is proposed to improve the 
control of CVDs in countries affected by high disease burden.

After the introduction of HAART, the HIV/AIDS epidemiological trends has shown 
an increasing in the survival rates. HAART has dramatically improved the life 
expectancy of HIV/AIDS. The objective of this study was to estimate survival in 
people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Puerto Rico (PR) from 2003-2011. A 
population-based study using the PR HIV Surveillance System was implemented. A 
total of N = 9,290 people were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in PR for 2003-2011 
period. Cox regression models for survival analysis were assessed. Survival at 6 
years after diagnosis in HIV patients was 0.87 (CI95%: 0.09, 0.72) when compare 
with AIDS patients at same time of diagnosis was 0.57 (CI95%: 0.55, 0.60) 
p<0.001. Intravenous drug users [IDU] have less probability of survival at 5 
years after diagnosis when compare with other transmission modes 0.69 (CI95%: 
0.67, 0.71) p<0.001. Assertive prevention strategies must be developed and 
implemented in PR for IDU's in order to increase their survival rates.

Al iniciar la era de la terapia antiretroviral para el VIH, se han evidenciado 
cambios en las tendencias de supervivencia de la enfermedad. El objetivo de este 
estudio fue estimar la supervivencia de las personas con VIH/SIDA en Puerto Rico 
para el periodo de 2003–2011. Se realizó un estudio de cohorte retrospectiva 
utilizando una base de datos secundarios del Sistema de Vigilancia VIH de Puerto 
Rico. Se registró un total de N = 9,240 sujetos diagnosticados con la enfermedad 
durante el periodo de estudio. La probabilidad de supervivencia a 6 años en 
personas en estadío de VIH fue de 0.87 (IC95%: 0.09, 0.72) en comparación con 
aquellos en estadío SIDA de 0.57 (IC95%: 0.55, 0.60) p<0.001. El modo de 
transmisión con menor probabilidad de supervivencia a 5 años fue el relacionado 
con el uso de drogas inyectables (UDI) con 0.69 (IC95%: 0.67, 0.71) p<0.001. Se 
recomienda estrategias de prevención dirigidas a personas con VIH/SIDA e 
historial de UDI de manera que se produzca un aumento en la supervivencia de 
esta población.

OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at estimating the value of the general 
population's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for one quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
in Iran.
METHODS: Using multistage randomized cluster sampling, we recruited and 
interviewed 651 adult residents of Shiraz, south Iran. The mean age of the 
interviewees was 43.9 ± 16.3 years, and 326 (50.1%) of them were male. To each 
interviewee, we presented one of the hypothetical health scenarios that were 
used in the European value of a QALY project. Questionnaires, which were 
validated for the Persian language, were administered in digitally-assisted 
format, and a gray block questionnaire was used for special cases. The data were 
then analyzed using STATA and SPSS.
RESULTS: The overall mean value of payment for one QALY of respondents who 
expressed WTP was US$2847, which is equal to 0.57 of the GDP per capita of 
Iran's population. Under the end-of-life (terminal illness) scenario, this value 
was 13% higher than health-gain scenarios. WTP was also associated with high 
educational level, household income, and household expenditure.
CONCLUSION: Our results provided a threshold range of WTP and insights into 
rigorous scientific decision making about healthcare technology for the future.

Between the 1930s and 50s, evolutionary biologists developed a successful theory 
of why organisms age, firmly rooted in population genetic principles. By the 
1980s the evolution of aging had a secure experimental basis. Since the force of 
selection declines with age, aging evolves due to mutation accumulation or a 
benefit to fitness early in life. Here we review major insights and challenges 
that have emerged over the last 35 years: selection does not always necessarily 
decline with age; higher extrinsic (i.e., environmentally caused) mortality does 
not always accelerate aging; conserved pathways control aging rate; senescence 
patterns are more diverse than previously thought; aging is not universal; 
trade-offs involving lifespan can be 'broken'; aging might be 'druggable'; and 
human life expectancy continues to rise but compressing late-life morbidity 
remains a pressing challenge.

Context/Objective: Since life expectancy of persons with spinal cord injury 
(SCI) has improved, it is relevant to know whether this group is able to 
maintain functional abilities many years after onset of SCI. Objectives of this 
study were (1) to examine associations between time since injury (TSI) and 
functional independence in persons with long-standing SCI and (2) to explore 
associations between functional independence and level of injury, comorbidities, 
mental health, waist circumference and secondary health conditions 
(SHCs).Design: TSI-stratified cross-sectional study. Strata were 10-19, 20-29 
and 30+ years.Setting: Community.Participants: 226 persons with long-standing 
SCI. Inclusion criteria: motor complete SCI; age at injury 18-35 years; TSI ≥ 10 
years; current age 28-65 years; wheelchair dependency.Interventions: Not 
applicable.Outcome measures: The Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM) was 
administered by a trained research assistant. Level of injury, comorbidities, 
mental health, waist circumference and SHCs were assessed by a rehabilitation 
physician.Results: Mean TSI was 23.6 (SD 9.1) years. No significant differences 
in SCIM scores were found between TSI strata. SCIM scores were lower for persons 
with tetraplegia, autonomic dysreflexia, hypotension, more than four SHCs and a 
high waist circumference. In linear regression analyses, TSI nor age was 
associated with the SCIM total score. Only level of injury (β = -0.7; P < .001) 
and waist circumference (β = -0.1; P = .042) were independent determinants 
(explained variance 55%).Conclusion: We found no association between TSI and 
functional independence in persons with long-standing motor complete SCI. This 
study confirms the possible effect of overweight on functional independence.

Objective: To determine the association between spinal cord injury (SCI) 
etiology categories and mortality, and examine the association between etiology 
sub-categories and mortality. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Model 
Systems and Shriners Hospital SCI units. Participants: Data were analyzed from 
42,627 cases in the SCI Model System Collaborative Survival Study Database from 
1973 to 2017. Those with SCI etiologies categorized as vehicular, violent, 
sports, falls, pedestrian, and medical were included. Interventions: Not 
applicable. Outcome Measure: Time to mortality after SCI. Results: Relative to 
the sports related etiology category, those with medical, pedestrian, violence, 
falls, and vehicular related SCIs had a 2.00 (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 
1.79-2.24), 1.57 (CIs: 1.34-1.83), 1.54 (CIs: 1.41-1.68), 1.35 (CIs: 1.25-1.45), 
and 1.26 (CIs: 1.17-1.35) higher hazard for mortality, respectfully. Persons 
with SCIs from automobile crashes had a 1.38 (CIs: 1.23-1.56) higher hazard for 
mortality, whereas those with SCIs from motorcycle crashes had a 1.21 (CIs: 
1.04-1.39) higher hazard for mortality, relative to other etiologies within the 
vehicular category. Those with SCIs from diving had a 1.37 (CIs: 1.18-1.59) 
higher hazard for mortality relative to other etiologies within the sports 
category. Conclusions: Injury etiology categories and certain sub-categories 
were associated with a higher risk for early mortality. Understanding how 
additional factors such as socioeconomic status, co-occurring injuries, medical 
co-morbidities, and environmental aspects interact with SCI etiologies may 
provide insights for how etiology of injury impacts survival. These findings may 
serve as a development for extending long-term life expectancy by informing SCI 
prevention programs and care post-injury.

The twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is 
an important pest of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) grown in greenhouses 
and outdoors. In this study, we evaluated the resistance status of five common 
strawberry cultivars ('Aromas', 'Kurdistan', 'Missionary', 'Paros', and 'Queen 
Elisa') under laboratory conditions. The developmental times of the preadult and 
adult stages, total longevity, reproduction, and life table parameters were 
analyzed according to the age-stage, two-sex life table theory, which provides 
the most comprehensive description on the survival, stage differentiation, and 
reproduction of a population. Preadult development was the shortest on Kurdistan 
and longest on Aromas (17.70 d vs. 21.00 d). The greatest number of oviposition 
days occurred on Missionary (28.65 d), whereas the fewest were on Queen Elisa 
(21.58 d). The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) and finite rate of 
increase (λ) varied among the cultivars. The highest values were found on 
Kurdistan (r = 0.1436d-1, λ=1.1544d-1), while the lowest values were on the 
Aromas cultivar (r = 0.1081d-1, λ=1.1141d-1). The longest mean generation time 
(T) of T. urticae occurred on Aromas. Based on the results of the present study, 
the cultivar Aromas was considered the most resistant to T. urticae and least 
favored strawberry cultivar for the development and reproduction of the mite. 
Demographic data of twospotted spider mite on these five strawberry cultivars 
can be used to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of the pest 
and thereby develop effective pest management strategies against T. urticae in 
both integrated and organic strawberry production.

Studded tires are used in a number of countries during winter in order to 
prevent accidents. The use of tire studs is controversial and debated because of 
human health impacts from increased road particle emissions. The aims of this 
study are to assess whether the use of tire studs in a Scandinavian studded 
passenger car actually avoids or causes health impacts from a broader life cycle 
perspective, and to assess the distribution of these impacts over the life 
cycle. Life cycle assessment is applied and the disability-adjusted life years 
indicator is used to quantify the following five types of health impacts: (1) 
impacts saved in the use phase, (2) particle emissions in the use phase, (3) 
production system emissions, (4) occupational accidents in the production 
system, and (5) conflict casualties from revenues of cobalt mining. The results 
show that the health benefits in the use phase in general are outweighed by the 
negative impacts during the life cycle. The largest contribution to these 
negative human health impacts are from use phase particle emissions (67⁻77%) and 
occupational accidents during artisanal cobalt mining (8⁻18%). About 23⁻33% of 
the negative impacts occur outside Scandinavia, where the benefits occur. The 
results inform the current debate and highlight the need for research on 
alternatives to tire studs with a positive net health balance.

BACKGROUND: Low specificity of prostate-specific antigen results in a 
considerable number of unnecessary prostate biopsies in current practice. 
SelectMDx® predicts significant prostate cancer upon biopsy and is used to 
reduce the number of unnecessary initial prostate biopsies. Furthermore, 
potential overtreatment of insignificant prostate cancer can be reduced. Besides 
the diagnostic accuracy of the test, also the context in a specific country 
determines the potential health benefit and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, the 
health benefit and cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx were assessed in France, 
Germany, Italy, and Spain.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: A decision model was used to compare the current standard 
of care in which men undergo initial prostate biopsy in case of an elevated 
prostate-specific antigen, to a strategy in which SelectMDx was used to select 
men for biopsy. Model inputs most relevant to each of the four countries were 
obtained. With use of the model long-term quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and healthcare costs were calculated for both strategies.
RESULTS: In all four countries, the SelectMDx resulted in QALY gain and cost 
savings compared with the current standard of care. In France, SelectMDx 
resulted in 0.022 QALYs gained and cost savings of €1217 per patient. For 
Germany, the model showed a QALY gain of 0.016 and a cost saving of €442. In 
Italy, the QALY gain and cost savings were 0.031 and €762. In Spain 0.020 QALYs 
were gained and €250 costs were saved.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model showed that with SelectMDx, QALYs could be 
gained while saving healthcare costs in the initial diagnosis of prostate 
cancer. The significant presence of overtreatment in the current standard of 
care in all four countries was the main factor that resulted in the beneficial 
outcomes with SelectMDx.

Regular prophylactic treatment with factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) 
concentrates in hemophilia A and B, respectively, is introduced in early infancy 
and has resulted in dramatic improvement of the conditions. Recombinant FVIII 
and FIX concentrates have been available for > 25 years and have been modified 
and refined through the years; however, unfortunately frequent intravenous 
administrations are still necessary. The half-lives of these products have now 
been extended (EHL) by fusion with albumin, the Fc-portion of IgG, or by being 
PEGylated. This has been very successful for EHL-FIX, with 3-5 times longer 
half-life, and to a lesser degree for EHL-FVIII with a half-life extension of 
only 1.5 times the conventional products. New treatment principles using FVIII 
mimetics or monoclonal antibodies that rebalance the pro- and anti-coagulation 
system by interfering with production of anti-thrombin or tissue factor pathway 
inhibitor have the benefits of long-lasting activity, subcutaneous 
administration, and being useful in patients both with and without neutralizing 
antibodies. As the ultimate treatment, recent progress has also been made with 
gene therapy of both hemophilia A and B.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pericardial effusion is commonly associated with malignancy. 
The goals of treatment should include optimizing symptom relief, minimizing 
repeat interventions, and restoring as much functional status as possible.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pericardiocentesis should be the first intervention but has 
high recurrence rates (30-60%). For patients with recurrence, repeat 
pericardiocentesis is indicated in those with limited expected lifespans. 
Extended pericardial drainage decreases recurrence to 10-20%. The addition of 
sclerosing agents decreases recurrence slightly but creates significant pain and 
can lead to pericardial constriction and therefore has fallen out of favor. Most 
patients with symptomatic pericardial disease have a short median survival time 
due to their underlying disease. In patients with a longer life expectancy, 
surgical drainage offers the lowest recurrence rate. Surgical approach is based 
on effusion location and clinical condition. Subxiphoid and thoracoscopic 
approaches lead to similar outcomes. Thoracotomy should be avoided as it 
increases morbidity without improving outcomes.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that the incidence of ischaemic stroke in 
young adults (18-50 years) has increased substantially. These patients have a 
long life expectancy after stroke, and the costs of long-term care pose huge 
challenges to health-care systems. Although the current recommendations for 
treatment of young and old (>50 years) patients with stroke are similar, the 
optimal management of young adult patients with stroke is unknown. They are 
usually not included in trials, and specific subanalyses limited to young adult 
patients with stroke are usually not done, owing to lower incidence of stroke 
and lower prevalence of vascular risk factors in young adults. Progress has been 
made in identifying patients with a considerable risk of stroke occurrence, such 
as those with patent foramen ovale. Future prevention studies might result in a 
decrease in the incidence of stroke and its sequelae in young adults. The 
development of guidelines specifically devoted to the management of stroke in 
young adults will be an important step in achieving this aim.

INTRODUCTION: Somatic complications account for the majority of the 13-30 years 
shortened life expectancy in psychiatric patients compared to the general 
population. The study aim was to assess to which extent patients visiting 
outpatient departments for mood and anxiety disorders were monitored for 
relevant somatic comorbidities and (adverse) effects of psychotropic drugs-more 
specifically a) metabolic parameters, b) lithium safety and c) ECGs-during their 
treatment.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective clinical records review and 
cross-sectional analysis to assess the extent of somatic monitoring at four 
outpatient departments for mood and anxiety disorders in The Netherlands. We 
consecutively recruited adult patients visiting a participating outpatient 
department between March and November 2014. The primary outcome was percentage 
of patients without monitoring measurements. Secondary outcomes were number of 
measurements per parameter per patient per year and time from start of treatment 
to first measurement.
RESULTS: We included 324 outpatients, of whom 60.2% were female. Most patients 
were treated for depressive disorders (39.8%), anxiety disorders (16.7%) or 
bipolar or related disorders (11.7%) and 198 patients (61.1%) used at least one 
psychotropic drug. For 186 patients (57.4%), no monitoring records were recorded 
(median treatment period 7.3 months, range 0-55.6). The median number of 
measurements per parameter per year since the start of outpatient treatment for 
patients with monitoring measurements was 0.31 (range 0.0-12.9). The median time 
to first monitoring measurement per parameter for patients with monitoring 
measurements was 3.8 months (range 0.0-50.7).
DISCUSSION: Somatic monitoring in outpatients with mood and anxiety disorders is 
not routine clinical practice. Monitoring practices need to be improved to 
prevent psychiatric outpatients from undetected somatic complications.

Each year, around 300,000 Herpes Zoster (HZ) cases are observed in the German 
population, resulting in costs over €182 million to society. The objective of 
this study was to estimate the potential public health and economic impact of 
the new Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) in the German 
population ≥ 60 years of age (YOA) and to identify the optimal age of 
vaccination. We used a static, multi-cohort Markov model that followed a 
hypothetical cohort of 1 million people ≥ 60 YOA life-long after vaccination 
using German-specific inputs. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on the societal 
perspective. The coverage of RZV was set at 40% with a second-dose compliance of 
70%. Vaccinating the population aged ≥ 60 YOA would result in 45,000 HZ cases 
avoided, 1,713 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at a total cost of 
approximately €63 million compared to 38,000 cases avoided, 1,545 QALYs gained 
at a total cost of approximately €68 million in the population ≥ 70 YOA. This 
would result in an ICER of approximately €37,000 and €44,000/QALY, for the age 
cohort ≥ 60 and ≥ 70 YOA, respectively. Scenario analyses demonstrated that 
vaccinating at age 60 or 65 YOA would show greater public health impact and 
would result in the lowest observed ICER compared to vaccinating at 70 YOA. In 
conclusion, starting vaccination with RZV in the German population ≥ 60 YOA 
would demonstrate the best value from a public health and economic standpoint.

The Andean Puna is an arid, high-elevation plateau in which plants such as 
grasses experience high abiotic stress and distinctive environmental conditions. 
We assessed colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate 
endophytes (DSE) in the roots of 20 native grass species and examined the 
relationship between root-associated fungi (AMF and DSE) as a function of the 
elevation of study sites, the photosynthetic pathways of the grass hosts, and 
the hosts' life cycles. In general, grasses were co-colonized by AMF and DSE and 
the colonization by AMF and DSE was not extensive. The extension of colonization 
of AMF and that of DSE were positively correlated, as were number of arbuscules 
and DSE colonization extension. The extension of AMF colonization differed among 
sites with different elevations, but DSE colonization was similar across sites. 
Overall, AMF and DSE patterns shifted as a function of elevation in most grass 
species, with no general trends observed with respect to host photosynthetic 
pathway or life cycle. In general, our observations differ from previous studies 
in the Northern Hemisphere. Variation among sites in AMF and DSE colonization 
was greater than variation that could be explained by the other factors 
considered here, suggesting a strong influence of environmental factors. We 
predict that both AMF and DSE may have established synergistic and beneficial 
associations with grasses in these distinctive and harsh ecosystems.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the distinct quality of life (QOL) trajectories among 
stroke survivors, and to evaluate the associations with their caregivers' 
burden, anxiety, and depression.
DESIGN: This was a longitudinal dyadic study.
SETTINGS: Stroke survivors and their informal caregivers were enrolled upon 
discharge from several rehabilitation hospitals, and they were followed during 
this multisite longitudinal study.
PARTICIPANTS: The stroke survivors (N=405, mean age=70.7y) included older adult 
men (52.0%), most of whom (80.9%) had had ischemic strokes. The caregivers 
(n=244, mean age=52.7y) included mostly women (65.2%), most of whom were the 
survivors' children (50.0%) or spouses (36.1%).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify the 
distinct QOL trajectories among the stroke survivors over the course of 12 
months of recovery. The longitudinal associations between the stroke survivor 
QOL trajectories and the caregivers' burden, anxiety, and depression were 
evaluated. A multinomial regression was then used to identify the predictors of 
the various survivor QOL trajectories.
RESULTS: Three distinct survivor QOL trajectories were identified: high and 
slightly improving QOL, moderate and slightly worsening QOL, and markedly 
improving QOL. The caregivers' burden, anxiety, and depression mirrored the 
survivors' QOL trajectories. In the multinomial models, an older survivor age, 
hemorrhagic stroke, lower education, and coexisting chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease or thyroid disease were significantly associated with a 
moderate and slightly worsening QOL trajectory. Women and blindness were 
associated with a markedly improving QOL survivor trajectory.
CONCLUSIONS: A survivor's QOL trajectory after a stroke was associated with 
their caregiver's burden, anxiety, and depression. Those survivors belonging to 
the moderate and slightly worsening QOL trajectory and their caregivers, in 
particular, need special care, because they are at risk for the worst outcomes.

Klotho, which is a life extension factor, and erythropoietin (EPO) have been 
introduced as effective neuroprotective factors in several neurological 
disorders. The present study is an attempt to examine the potential role of 
klotho and EPO in therapeutic effect of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) in 
pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling model. In order to induce the kindling 
model, PTZ was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) at dose of 36.5 mg/kg 
every other day for 20 days. Male NMRI mice received pre-treatment of free 
curcumin or curcumin-loaded NPs (12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) 10 days before PTZ injection 
and this was continued until 1 h before each PTZ injection. Immunostaining 
against NeuN, as a marker of neuronal maturation, and EPO was performed on 
hippocampal brain sections. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) was conducted to assess the expression levels of tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), klotho and EPO in the hippocampus. Immunostaining data 
indicated that treatment with curcumin-loaded NPs significantly alleviates the 
neuronal cell death in PTZ receiving animals. Curcumin-loaded NPs effectively 
upregulated the levels of EPO and klotho in PTZ receiving animals. Furthermore, 
mRNA level of TNF-α was considerably reduced in animals undergone 
curcumin-loaded NPs treatment. Overall, the results of this study suggest that 
downregulation of TNF-α and consequent upregulation of klotho and EPO might 
contribute to the neuroprotective effect of curcumin-loaded NPs in experimental 
model of epilepsy.

BACKGROUND: Reports of low-value prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing 
(testing in which the harms outweigh the benefits) generally employ population 
level data sources. While such results may be generalizable, they often lack the 
detail necessary to understand provider clinical decision making and guideline 
concordance. Using a retrospective study of PSA testing at our institution we 
intend to characterize the frequency and patterns associated with low-value PSA 
testing.
METHODS: We leveraged the electronic health record to determine 
guideline-defined low-value testing in our health system from 07/01/2012 to 
06/30/2017. Secondarily, we measured the between-testing interval for repeat 
tests and the rates of prostate cancer risk factors and comorbidities among men 
receiving screening.
RESULTS: Overall, 21,145 PSA tests were performed on 12,303 men. The rate of 
low-value testing ranged from 23.4 to 56.8%, depending upon the specific 
guideline. For repeat tests, the median between-testing interval was 12.6 
months. Risk factors for prostate cancer were uncommon, but more frequent in men 
age <55 years compared to men age 55-69 years (17.6% vs. 13.5%, p < 0.001). 
Screened older men (age >70 years) were more likely to have a Charlson 
Comorbidity Index ≥ 3, compared to the 55-69 reference group (31.4% vs. 17.3%, 
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Low-value prostate cancer testing is prevalent. Between-testing
