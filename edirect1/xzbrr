BACKGROUND: Stroke survivors encounter emotional problems in the chronic phase 
after stroke. Post-stroke depressive symptoms have major impact on 
health-related quality of life (HRQol) and lead to increased hospitalization and 
therefore substantial healthcare costs. We present a cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility evaluation of a cognitive behavioural therapy augmented with 
occupational and movement therapy to support patients with a stroke with 
depressive symptoms in goal-setting and goal attainment (augmented CBT) in 
comparison with a computerized cognitive training program (CogniPlus) as a 
control intervention.
METHODS: A trial-based economic evaluation was conducted from a societal 
perspective with a time horizon of 12 months. Stroke patients (aged 18+ years) 
with signs of depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - 
subscale depression > 7) were eligible to participate. Primary outcomes were the 
HADS and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) based on the three-level 
five-dimensional EuroQol (EQ-5D-3 L). Missing data were handled through mean 
imputation (costs) and multiple imputation (HADS and EuroQol), and costs were 
bootstrapped. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of baseline 
assumptions.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included. The average total societal costs were 
not significantly different between the control group (€9,998.3) and the 
augmented CBT group (€8,063.7), with a 95 % confidence interval (-5,284, 1,796). 
The augmented CBT intervention was less costly and less effective from a 
societal perspective on the HADS, and less costly and slightly more effective in 
QALYs, in comparison with the control treatment. The cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility analyses provided greater effects and fewer costs for the augmented 
CBT group, and fewer effects and costs for the HADS. Based on a willingness to 
pay (WTP) level of €40,000 per QALY, the augmented CBT intervention had a 76 % 
chance of being cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness of 
results.
CONCLUSION: The stroke-specific augmented CBT intervention did not show 
convincing cost-effectiveness results. In addition to other literature, this 
study provided new insights into the potential cost-effectiveness of an adjusted 
cognitive behavioural therapy intervention. However, as our study showed a 76 % 
chance of being cost-effective for one outcome measure (QALY) and did not 
provide convincing cost-effectiveness results on the HADS we recommend further 
research in a larger population.

BACKGROUND: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a spectrum of 
life-threatening cardiac diseases usually due to coronary artery plaque rupture, 
subsequent thrombin generation plaque activation and thrombus formation. To 
date, no economic analyses have been published about the use of fondaparinux in 
NSTE-ACS patients in Canada. The purpose of our study is to estimate the 
lifetime cost-effectiveness of fondaparinux compared to enoxaparin for 
non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients in a Canadian 
hospital setting.
METHODS: As an extension of a previous published economic analysis for US 
patients, an event-based decision analytic model was constructed using clinical 
and resource use data from OASIS-5, a randomized trial of 20,078 patients from 
41 countries. A public payer perspective in the hospital setting was adopted. 
Resource use data from the trial were valued using Canadian costs. A cost 
regression model was developed to estimate the mean cost of managing the 
clinical events over the 180 day period. Annual costs of long-term care for ACS 
patients were added after 180 days until death. Long-term survival was 
incorporated using Canadian life tables with further adjustment for additional 
risks associated with NSTE-ACS. Quality-of-life (utility) decrements from 
published sources were applied to clinical events. Lifetime costs (2009 CAD$) 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted annually at 5 %, were 
estimated for the typical patient in OASIS-5 (i.e., at mean covariate values).
RESULTS: The trial data showed that fondaparinux is protective against all 
clinical events observed in the trial. The model showed that: over 180 days, 
fondaparinux dominates enoxaparin, producing similar estimates of QALYs gained 
and saving $439; over a patient's lifetime, fondaparinux yields an ICER of 
$4293/QALY. Based on PSA, the probabilities that fondaparinux dominates 
enoxaparin (less costly and more effective) and that is cost-effective at a 
$50,000 threshold were 42 % and 96 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Canadian hospital setting, fondaparinux is cost-effective 
when compared to enoxaparin for the treatment of NSTE-ACS. This result holds 
both in the immediate post-event period and over the lifetimes of patients.

Continuous deep sedation and homicide: an unsolved problem in law and 
professional morality.

When a severely suffering dying patient is deeply sedated, and this sedated 
condition is meant to continue until his death, the doctor involved often 
decides to abstain from artificially administering fluids. For this dual 
procedure almost all guidelines require that the patient should not have a life 
expectancy beyond a stipulated maximum of days (4-14). The reason obviously is 
that in case of a longer life-expectancy the patient may die from dehydration 
rather than from his lethal illness. But no guideline tells us how we should 
describe the dual procedure in case of a longer life-expectancy. Many arguments 
have been advanced why we should not consider it to be a form of homicide, that 
is, ending the life of the patient (with or without his request). I argue that 
none of these arguments, taken separately or jointly, is persuasive. When a 
commission, even one that is not itself life-shortening, foreseeably renders a 
person unable to undo the life-shortening effects of another, simultaneous 
omission, the commission and the omission together should be acknowledged to 
kill her. I discuss the legal and ethical implications of this conclusion.

Nodules >4 cm.

BACKGROUND: The management of thyroid nodules >4 cm with benign cytology after 
fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is controversial. FNAB is associated with a 
high false-negative rate in this setting, and may result in a delayed diagnosis 
and management of thyroid cancer. However, the majority of these nodules are 
benign. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the cost-utility 
of observation versus surgical management for thyroid nodules >4 cm with benign 
cytology after FNAB.
METHODS: A microsimulation model comparing routine thyroid lobectomy with 
observation for low-risk patients with >4 cm thyroid nodules with benign FNAB 
cytology was constructed. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
life-years gained were calculated over a lifetime time horizon from a U.S. 
Medicare perspective.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients undergoing thyroid lobectomy for benign 
final pathology was 40% in the observation strategy versus 66% in the surgical 
strategy (p < 0.001). Overall, the surgical strategy was associated with higher 
lifetime costs compared with the observation strategy (incremental difference: + 
US$12,992 [confidence interval (CI) 13,042-13,524]), but also more QALYs (+0.12 
QALYs [CI 0.02-0.24]) and longer life expectancy (+1.67 years [CI 1.00-2.41]). 
Incremental lifetime costs were lower for patients <55 years compared with those 
≥55 years (+11,181 vs. +14,811, p < 0.001). The probability of 
cost-effectiveness of the surgical strategy was 49% at a $100k/QALY threshold or 
65% at a $100k/life-year gained threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine thyroid lobectomy is associated with improved outcomes at 
an acceptable cost compared with observation for thyroid nodules >4 cm with 
benign cytology after FNAB. Surgical resection may be a cost-effective strategy 
to rule out malignancy in these nodules.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the conditions under which the Cold Weather Plan (CWP) 
for England is likely to prove cost-effective in order to inform the development 
of the CWP in the short term before direct data on costs and benefits can be 
collected.
STUDY DESIGN: Mathematical modelling study undertaken in the absence of direct 
epidemiological evidence on the effect of the CWP in reducing cold-related 
mortality and morbidity, and limited data or on its costs.
METHODS: The model comprised a simulated temperature time series based on 
historical data; epidemiologically-derived relationships between temperature, 
and mortality and morbidity; and information on baseline unit costs of contacts 
with health care and community care services. Cost-effectiveness was assessed 
assuming varying levels of protection against cold-related burdens, coverage of 
the vulnerable population and willingness-to-pay criteria.
RESULTS: Simulations showed that the CWP is likely to be cost effective under 
some scenarios at the high end of the willingness to pay threshold used by 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England, but these 
results are sensitive to assumptions about the extent of implementation of the 
CWP at local level, and its assumed effectiveness when implemented. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied from £29,754 to £75,875 per Quality 
Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. Conventional cost-effectiveness 
(<£30,000/QALY) was reached only when effective targeting of at-risk groups was 
assumed (i.e. need for low coverage (∼5%) of the population for targeted 
actions) and relatively high assumed effectiveness (>15%) in avoiding deaths and 
hospital admissions.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the modelling relied on a large number of assumptions, 
this type of modelling is useful for understanding whether, and in what 
circumstances, untested plans are likely to be cost-effective before they are 
implemented and in the early period of implementation before direct data on 
cost-effectiveness have accrued. Steps can then be taken to optimize the 
relevant parameters as far as practicable during the early implementation 
period.

OBJECTIVE: In Switzerland, fewer than 40% of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected 
individuals have been diagnosed. The aim of this project was to analyse the 
distribution of HCV cases in order to develop better detection strategies.
STUDY DESIGN: Historical data on the HCV-infected population in Switzerland were 
obtained from published literature, unpublished data and government reports. A 
disease progression model was used to age the infected population to 2015. The 
HCV distribution was then used to identify 5-year age cohorts with the highest 
HCV prevalence. The estimated number of cases needed to screen within an age 
cohort was calculated using the estimated viraemic prevalence, removing the 
percent previously diagnosed.
RESULTS: In 2015, the median age of the viraemic HCV infected population was 49 
years, with 75% of the population born between 1951 and 1985. Random screening 
of the general population could identify one new viraemic HCV case per 159 
persons screened, compared with targeted birth cohort screening, which could 
identify one new viraemic HCV case per 90-99 persons screened.
CONCLUSION: Considering only the direct cost of screening and treatment 
informing tests, targeted screening by birth cohort is more effective and cost 
effective than random screening in the general population.

OBJECTIVES: To empirically compare Markov cohort modeling (MM) and discrete 
event simulation (DES) with and without dynamic queuing (DQ) for 
cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis of a novel method of health services delivery 
where capacity constraints predominate.
METHODS: A common data-set comparing usual orthopedic care (UC) to an orthopedic 
physiotherapy screening clinic and multidisciplinary treatment service (OPSC) 
was used to develop a MM and a DES without (DES-no-DQ) and with DQ (DES-DQ). 
Model results were then compared in detail.
RESULTS: The MM predicted an incremental CE ratio (ICER) of $495 per additional 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for OPSC over UC. The DES-no-DQ showed OPSC 
dominating UC; the DES-DQ generated an ICER of $2342 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The MM and DES-no-DQ ICER estimates differed due to the MM having 
implicit delays built into its structure as a result of having fixed cycle 
lengths, which are not a feature of DES. The non-DQ models assume that queues 
are at a steady state. Conversely, queues in the DES-DQ develop flexibly with 
supply and demand for resources, in this case, leading to different estimates of 
resource use and CE. The choice of MM or DES (with or without DQ) would not 
alter the reimbursement of OPSC as it was highly cost-effective compared to UC 
in all analyses. However, the modeling method may influence decisions where 
ICERs are closer to the CE acceptability threshold, or where capacity 
constraints and DQ are important features of the system. In these cases, DES-DQ 
would be the preferred modeling technique to avoid incorrect resource allocation 
decisions.

Evolution of maternal effect senescence.

Increased maternal age at reproduction is often associated with decreased 
offspring performance in numerous species of plants and animals (including 
humans). Current evolutionary theory considers such maternal effect senescence 
as part of a unified process of reproductive senescence, which is under 
identical age-specific selective pressures to fertility. We offer a novel 
theoretical perspective by combining William Hamilton's evolutionary model for 
aging with a quantitative genetic model of indirect genetic effects. We 
demonstrate that fertility and maternal effect senescence are likely to 
experience different patterns of age-specific selection and thus can evolve to 
take divergent forms. Applied to neonatal survival, we find that selection for 
maternal effects is the product of age-specific fertility and Hamilton's 
age-specific force of selection for fertility. Population genetic models show 
that senescence for these maternal effects can evolve in the absence of 
reproductive or actuarial senescence; this implies that maternal effect aging is 
a fundamentally distinct demographic manifestation of the evolution of aging. 
However, brief periods of increasingly beneficial maternal effects can evolve 
when fertility increases with age faster than cumulative survival declines. This 
is most likely to occur early in life. Our integration of theory provides a 
general framework with which to model, measure, and compare the evolutionary 
determinants of the social manifestations of aging. Extension of our maternal 
effects model to other ecological and social contexts could provide important 
insights into the drivers of the astonishing diversity of lifespans and aging 
patterns observed among species.

Erectile dysfunction in young patients is a proxy of overall men's health 
status.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article summarizes current findings supporting the role 
of erectile dysfunction as a proxy of general health status, with a focus on the 
young population.
RECENT FINDINGS: Erectile dysfunction has been historically associated to 
increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. Several studies supported the role 
of erectile dysfunction as a predictive factor of subsequent cardiovascular 
events, acquiring significant importance even in young men. Similarly, erectile 
dysfunction emerged as a potential marker for metabolic alterations including 
diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, eventually presenting as the initial 
manifestation of a dysmetabolic condition in young patients. Moreover, current 
epidemiologic data demonstrated a significant association of erectile 
dysfunction with several conditions including vascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal disorders, and endocrine with chronic-sustained inflammation 
representing the common pathophysiological link between erectile dysfunction and 
comorbidities. Interestingly, longitudinal studies demonstrated a higher risk of 
overall mortality in patients complaining of erectile dysfunction, even 
irrespective of cardiovascular risk.
SUMMARY: Erectile dysfunction does not represent an uncommon condition among 
young men. Considering the amount of data demonstrating a strong correlation 
between several life-risky comorbidities and erectile dysfunction, a careful and 
comprehensive general health assessment of patients complaining of erectile 
dysfunction should be carried out, regardless of patient's age. The 
identification of erectile dysfunction as an early sign of a major comorbidity 
would allow the implementation of therapeutic measures aimed at improving the 
overall health status and life expectancy across the entire aging process.

BACKGROUND: A 4-month first-line treatment regimen for tuberculosis disease (TB) 
is expected to have a direct impact on patient outcomes and societal costs, as 
well as an indirect impact on Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. We aimed 
to estimate this combined impact in a high TB-burden country: South Africa.
METHOD: An individual based M. tb transmission model was fitted to the TB burden 
of South Africa using a standard TB natural history framework. We measured the 
impact on TB burden from 2015-2035 of introduction of a non-inferior 4-month 
regimen replacing the standard 6-month regimen as first-line therapy. Impact was 
measured with respect to three separate baselines (Guidelines, Policy and 
Current), reflecting differences in adherence to TB and HIV treatment 
guidelines. Further scenario analyses considered the variation in 
treatment-related parameters and resistance levels. Impact was measured in terms 
of differences in TB burden and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted. 
We also examined the highest cost at which the new regimen would be 
cost-effective for several willingness-to-pay thresholds.
RESULTS: It was estimated that a 4-month regimen would avert less than 1% of the 
predicted 6 million person years with TB disease in South Africa between 2015 
and 2035. A similarly small impact was seen on deaths and DALYs averted. Despite 
this small impact, with the health systems and patient cost savings from regimen 
shortening, the 4-month regimen could be cost-effective at $436 [NA, 5983] (mean 
[range]) per month at a willingness-to-pay threshold of one GDP per capita 
($6,618).
CONCLUSION: The introduction of a non-inferior 4-month first-line TB regimen 
into South Africa would have little impact on the TB burden. However, under 
several scenarios, it is likely that the averted societal costs would make such 
a regimen cost-effective in South Africa.

advantageous effects of statins in populations with different levels of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Considering the increasing cardiovascular 
risk among the Iranian population, the cost-effectiveness of the use of 
simvastatin 10 mg, as an Over-The-Counter (OTC) drug, for the primary prevention 
of myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated in this modeling study, from the 
payer's perspective. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 45-year 
CVD healthy men with an average (15%) 10-year CVD risk.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model with a life-long time horizon was developed to 
evaluate the Cost-Utility-Analysis (CUA) and Cost-Effectiveness-Analysis (CEA) 
of the use of OTC simvastatin 10 mg compared to no-drug therapy. Two measures of 
benefits were used in the model; Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs) for the CUA 
and Life-Years-Gained (LYG) for the CEA. To examine the robustness of the 
results, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
were applied to the model.
RESULTS: For the base-case scenario with a discount rate of 0% the estimated 
ICERs were 1113 USD/QALY and 935USD/LYG per patient (using governmental 
tariffs). No threshold has been determined in Iran for the cost-effectiveness of 
health-related interventions. However, according to the recommendation of WHO, 
this intervention can be considered highly cost-effective as its ICER is far 
less than the reported GDP per capita for Iran by World bank in 2013 ($4763).
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study showed that the use of an OTC low dose statin 
(simvastatin 10 mg) for the primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in 
45-year men with a 10-year CVD risk of 15% could be considered highly 
cost-effective in Iran, as it meets the WHO threshold of the annual GDP per 
capita ($4763).

INTRODUCTION: Two recent clinical trials, phase III RTOG 0614 and phase II RTOG 
0933, showed some effectiveness of Memantine and IMRT planning for hippocampus 
sparing, among patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for brain 
metastases; however, their use in routine clinical practice is unknown.
METHODS: A survey was sent to 1933 radiation oncologists in the US. Data 
collected included utilization of Memantine and hippocampus sparing, reasons for 
adoption and non-adoption, and demographic variables.
RESULTS: A total of 196 radiation oncologists responded to the survey, with 64% 
reporting using Memantine in almost none of the patients receiving WBRT for 
brain metastases, and only 11% considering Memantine for <10% of their patients. 
The most common reason for not using Memantine was a poor patient performance 
status, and limited life expectancy. Likewise, 56% of radiation oncologists 
would not change their clinical practice to include hippocampus sparing IMRT in 
patients receiving WBRT based on the results of RTOG 0933. Further validation of 
hippocampus sparing in a phase III trial was supported by 71% of radiation 
oncologists, whereas further exploration of Memantine for this purpose in a 
phase III trial was supported by 42%.
CONCLUSIONS: At this time, the majority of surveyed radiation oncologists in the 
US do not use Memantine, or IMRT planning for hippocampus sparing in patients 
receiving WBRT. Further validation of the hippocampus sparing concept in a phase 
III trial was supported, before adopting it in routine clinical practice.

The methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) family of enzymes has been shown to 
protect cells against oxidative damage. The two major Msr enzymes, MsrA and 
MsrB, can repair oxidative damage to proteins due to reactive oxygen species, by 
reducing the methionine sulfoxide in proteins back to methionine. A role of MsrA 
in animal aging was first demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster where 
transgenic flies over-expressing recombinant bovine MsrA had a markedly extended 
life span. Subsequently, MsrA was also shown to be involved in the life span 
extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. These results supported other studies that 
indicated up-regulation, or activation, of the normal cellular protective 
mechanisms that cells use to defend against oxidative damage could be an 
approach to treat age related diseases and slow the aging process. In this study 
we have identified, for the first time, compounds structurally related to the 
natural products fusaricidins that markedly activate recombinant bovine and 
human MsrA and human MsrB.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequently seen demyelinating disease, with 
a prevalence that varies considerably, from high levels in North America and 
Europe (>100/100,000 inhabitants) to low rates in Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa (2/100,000 population). Knowledge of the geographical distribution of the 
disease and its survival data, and a better understanding of the natural history 
of the disease, have improved our understanding of the respective roles of 
endogenous and exogenous causes of MS. Concerning mortality, in a large French 
cohort of 27,603 patients, there was no difference between MS patients and 
controls in the first 20 years of the disease, although life expectancy was 
reduced by 6-7 years in MS patients. In 2004, the prevalence of MS in France was 
94.7/100,000 population, according to data from the French National Health 
Insurance Agency for Salaried Workers (Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie des 
travailleurs Salariés [CNAM-TS]), which insures 87% of the French population. 
This prevalence was higher in the North and East of France. In several 
countries, including France, the gender ratio for MS incidence (women/men) went 
from 2/1 to 3/1 from the 1950s to the 2000s, but only for the 
relapsing-remitting form. As for risk factors of MS, the most pertinent 
environmental factors are infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), especially if 
it arises after childhood and is symptomatic. The role of smoking in MS risk has 
been confirmed, but is modest. In contrast, vaccines, stress, traumatic events 
and allergies have not been identified as risk factors, while the involvement of 
vitamin D has yet to be confirmed. From a genetic point of view, the association 
between HLA-DRB1*15:01 and a high risk of MS has been known for decades. More 
recently, immunogenetic markers have been identified (IL2RA, IL7RA) and, in 
particular thanks to studies of genome-wide associations, more than 100 genetic 
variants have been reported. Most of these are involved in the immune response 
and often associated with other autoimmune diseases. Studies of the natural 
history of MS suggest it is a two-phase disease: in the first phase, 
inflammation is focal with flares; and in the second phase, disability 
progresses independently of focal inflammation. This has clear implications for 
therapy. Age may also be a key factor in the phenotype of the disease. In 
conclusion, France is a high-risk country for MS, but it only slightly reduces 
life expectancy. MS is a multifactorial disease and the implications of 
immunogenetics are major. Preventative approaches might be derived from 
knowledge of the risk factors and natural history of the disease (smoking, 
vitamin D).

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer with poor 
prognosis, linked to occupational asbestos exposure. Vascular endothelial growth 
factor is a key mitogen for malignant pleural mesothelioma cells, therefore 
targeting of vascular endothelial growth factor might prove effective. We aimed 
to assess the effect on survival of bevacizumab when added to the present 
standard of care, cisplatin plus pemetrexed, as first-line treatment of advanced 
malignant pleural mesothelioma.
METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited 
patients aged 18-75 years with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma who 
had not received previous chemotherapy, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status of 0-2, had no substantial cardiovascular comorbidity, 
were not amenable to curative surgery, had at least one evaluable (pleural 
effusion) or measurable (pleural tumour solid thickening) lesion with CT, and a 
life expectancy of >12 weeks from 73 hospitals in France. Exclusion criteria 
were presence of central nervous system metastases, use of antiaggregant 
treatments (aspirin ≥325 mg per day, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or dipyridamole), 
anti-vitamin K drugs at a curative dose, treatment with low-molecular-weight 
heparin at a curative dose, and treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs. We randomly allocated patients (1:1; minimisation method used [random 
factor of 0·8]; patients stratified by histology [epithelioid vs sarcomatoid or 
mixed histology subtypes], performance status score [0-1 vs 2], study centre, or 
smoking status [never smokers vs smokers]) to receive intravenously 500 mg/m(2) 
pemetrexed plus 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin with (PCB) or without (PC) 15 mg/kg 
bevacizumab in 21 day cycles for up to six cycles, until progression or toxic 
effects. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to treat 
population. Treatment was open label. This IFCT-GFPC-0701 trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00651456.
FINDINGS: From Feb 13, 2008, to Jan 5, 2014, we randomly assigned 448 patients 
to treatment (223 [50%] to PCB and 225 [50%] to PC). OS was significantly longer 
with PCB (median 18·8 months [95% CI 15·9-22·6]) than with PC (16·1 months 
[14·0-17·9]; hazard ratio 0·77 [0·62-0·95]; p=0·0167). Overall, 158 (71%) of 222 
patients given PCB and 139 (62%) of 224 patients given PC had grade 3-4 adverse 
events. We noted more grade 3 or higher hypertension (51 [23%] of 222 vs 0) and 
thrombotic events (13 [6%] of 222 vs 2 [1%] of 224) with PCB than with PC.
INTERPRETATION: Addition of bevacizumab to pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
significantly improved OS in malignant pleural mesothelioma at the cost of 
expected manageable toxic effects, therefore it should be considered as a 
suitable treatment for the disease.

We report a case of bilateral femoral fractures and right tibial fracture in an 
elderly suffering from osteoporosis. Increasing geriatric population and better 
life expectancy can result in complicating simple fragility fractures, fixed 
with traditional implants, into peri-prosthetic fractures postoperatively. They 
then pose a real challenge in fracture fixation and prolonged rehabilitation. 
The aim of this case report is acknowledge the increasing prevalence of complex 
peri-prosthetic fragility fractures in extremes of age and the challenges they 
present to the surgeons and community both in terms of skills and resources.

Antiretroviral therapy partially restores the immune system and markedly 
increases life expectancy of HIV-infected patients. However, antiretroviral 
therapy does not restore full health. These patients suffer from poorly 
understood chronic inflammation that causes a number of AIDS and non-AIDS 
complications. Here we show that chronic inflammation in HIV+ patients may be 
due to the disruption of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway by HIV 
envelope protein gp120IIIB. Our results demonstrate that HIV gp120IIIB induces 
α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7) upregulation and a paradoxical 
proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages, as activation of the upregulated α7 is 
no longer capable of inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Our 
results demonstrate that disruption of the cholinergic-mediated 
anti-inflammatory response can result from an HIV protein. Collectively, these 
findings suggest that HIV tampering with a natural strategy to control 
inflammation could contribute to a crucial, unresolved problem of HIV infection: 
chronic inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Outcome measures are rarely available for surveillance and system 
performance monitoring for mental disorders and addictions. Our study aims to 
demonstrate the feasibility and face validity of routinely measuring the 
mortality gap in the Canadian context at the provincial and regional levels 
using the methods and data available to the Canadian Chronic Disease 
Surveillance System (CCDSS) of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease 
Surveillance System, which also provides aggregated data to the CCDSS. This 
includes data from the health insurance registry physician claims and the 
hospital discharge abstract for all mental disorder diagnoses (International 
Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 290-319 or ICD-10 F00-F99). Patients were 
defined as having had received a mental disorder diagnosis at least once during 
the year. Life expectancy was measured using Chiang's method for abridged life 
tables, complemented by the Hsieh method for adjustment of the last age 
interval.
RESULTS: We found a lower life expectancy among psychiatric patients of 8 years 
for men and 5 years for women. For patients with schizophrenia, life expectancy 
was lowered by 12 years for men and 8 years for women. Cardiovascular disease 
and cancer were the most common causes of premature death. Findings were 
consistent across time and regions of the province. Lower estimates of the 
mortality gap, compared with literature, could be explained by the inclusion of 
primary care patients and methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using administrative data 
to measure the impact of current and future mental health plans in Canada 
provided the techniques can be replicated in other Canadian provinces.

OBJECTIF : Les mesures des résultats sont rarement disponibles pour le rendement 
de la surveillance et du système contrôlant les maladies mentales et les 
dépendances. Notre étude vise à démontrer la faisabilité et la validité 
apparente de mesurer couramment les disparités de mortalité dans le contexte 
canadien à l’échelle provinciale et régionale, à l’aide des méthodes et des 
données offertes par le Système national de surveillance des maladies chroniques 
(SNSMC) de l’Agence de la santé publique du Canada.
MÉTHODES : Nous avons utilisé des données longitudinales du Système intégré de 
surveillance des maladies chroniques du Québec, qui fournit aussi des données 
cumulatives au SNSMC. Ceci comprend des données de facturation des médecins du 
registre de l’assurance maladie et des sommaires des congés d’hôpitaux pour tous 
les diagnostics de trouble mental (Classification internationale des maladies 
[CIM]-9 290–319 ou CIM-10 F00–F99). Les patients ont été définis comme ayant 
reçu un diagnostic de trouble mental au moins une fois durant l’année. 
L’espérance de vie a été mesurée à l’aide de la méthode de Chiang pour les 
tables de mortalité abrégées, complétée par la méthode de Hsieh pour ajustement 
du dernier intervalle d’âge.
RÉSULTATS : Nous avons constaté chez les patients psychiatriques une espérance 
de vie moins élevée de 8 ans pour les hommes et de 5 ans pour les femmes. Pour 
les patients souffrant de schizophrénie, l’espérance de vie était moins élevée 
de 12 ans pour les hommes et de 8 ans pour les femmes. La maladie 
cardiovasculaire et le cancer étaient les causes les plus communes de décès 
prématuré. Les résultats étaient cohérents à travers le temps et les régions de 
la province. Les estimations moins élevées des disparités de mortalité, 
comparativement à la littérature, pourraient s’expliquer par l’inclusion des 
patients et des méthodes des soins primaires.
CONCLUSIONS : Notre étude démontre la faisabilité d’utiliser des données 
administratives pour mesurer l’impact des plans de santé mentale présents et 
futurs au Canada, si les techniques peuvent être reproduites dans d’autres 
provinces canadiennes
