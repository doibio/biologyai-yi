life years (DALYs) described the trend and burden of RIs. We calculated 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) for 
the above indexes to evaluate the temporal trend of RIs. We evaluated the 
social-demographic index (SDI) with epidemiological RI parameters and reported 
proportions of age-standardized rates due to RI. (3) Results: In 2019, the 
global incidence of RIs reached 103.2 million. The EAPC of RI incidence 
increased, whereas deaths and DALYs decreased. Age-standardized incident rate 
(ASIR) was highest in low-middle SDI regions, age-standardized death rate (ASDR) 
was high in middle SDI regions, and age-standardized DALYs increased in low SDI 
regions. The highest accident rates were found in those aged 20-24 years old. 
Cyclist injuries were the leading RIs (34%), though pedestrian and motor vehicle 
accidents were the leading cause of death (37.4%, 37.6%) and DALYs (35.7%, 
32.3%), respectively. (4) Conclusions: Over the past 30 years, RIs incidence 
increased annually, though death and DALY rates decreased. RIs places a 
considerable burden on public health in low SDI countries. Data should be used 
to develop and implement effective measures to reduce the burden of RIs.

The aim was to evaluate the determinants of acute exacerbation (AE) and death in 
new cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using administrative databases 
in the Marche Region. Adults at their first prescription of antifibrotics or 
hospitalization with a diagnosis of IPF occurring in 2014-2019 were considered 
as new cases. Multiple Cox regression was used to estimate the risk of AE and of 
all-cause mortality adjusted by demographic and clinical characteristics, 
stratifying patients according to antifibrotic treatment. Overall, 676 new cases 
of IPF were identified and 276 deaths and 248 AE events occurred. In 
never-treated patients, the risk of AE was higher in patients with poor health 
conditions at diagnosis; the risk of death was higher in males, in patients aged 
≥75 and in those with poor health conditions at baseline. The increasing number 
of AEs increased the risk of death in treated and never-treated patients. Within 
the limits of an observational study based on secondary data, the combined use 
of healthcare administrative databases allows the accurate analysis of 
progression and survival of IPF from the beginning of the antifibrotic therapy 
era, suggesting that timely and early diagnosis is critical to prescribing the 
most suitable treatment to increase survival and maintain a healthy life 
expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Communicating the diagnosis of a genetic and neurodegenerative 
disease, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), requires a transmission centered 
on the patient and/or the family caregiver, ensuring autonomy to those involved 
and strengthening the doctor-patient relationship.
OBJECTIVE: Analyzing the communication of the SMA diagnosis from the perspective 
of patients and family members.
METHODS: This qualitative study was developed through semi-structured 
interviews, via teleconsultation. The analysis was developed by systematically 
condensing the answers and synthesizing them into four thematic axes 
(clarification of the diagnosis, communication of the prognosis, affective 
memory related to the event, and advice to physicians).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Twenty-nine patients with SMA and 28 family caregivers 
of people with this condition, from all regions of Brazil, reported that 
individualized, clear, honest, and welcoming communication, emphasizing positive 
aspects, in the presence of family members and with the possibility of 
continuous monitoring, was important to meeting their communication needs. A 
lack of empathy, monitoring and guidance, and estimating life expectancy 
resulted in negative experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: The communication needs of patients and family members described 
during the clarification of the diagnosis and prognosis of SMA predominantly 
involve empathic factors related to the attitude of the attending physician 
throughout the evolution of the disease. Future research evaluating other 
neurodegenerative diseases and the development of research protocols are 
important to improving communication between physicians, patients, and family 
members.

BACKGROUND: Transarterial Radioembolisation (TARE) requires multidisciplinary 
experience and skill to be effective. The aim of this study was to identify 
determinants of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
focusing on learning curves, technical advancements, patient selection and 
subsequent therapies.
METHODS: From 2005 to 2020, 253 patients were treated. TARE results achieved in 
an initial period (2005-2011) were compared to those obtained in a more recent 
period (2012-2020). To isolate the effect of the treatment period, differences 
between the two periods were balanced using "entropy balance".
RESULTS: Of the 253 patients, 68 were treated before 2012 and 185 after 2012. In 
the second period, patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
Performance Status (PS) score of 1 (p = 0.025) less frequently, less liver 
involvement (p = 0.006) and a lesser degree of vascular invasion (p = 0.019). 
The median overall survival (OS) of patients treated before 2012 was 11.2 months 
and that of patients treated beginning in 2012 was 25.7 months. After 
reweighting to isolate the effect of the treatment period, the median OS of 
patients before 2012 increased to 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Better patient selection, refinement of technique and adoption of 
personalised dosimetry improved survival after TARE. Conversely, sorafenib after 
TARE did not impact life expectancy.

Diagnosis and management of sinonasal complications of dental diseases or 
treatment (SCDDT) may be challenging. We aimed to report our real-life 
experience in patients treated with endoscopic endonasal approach describing 
data about symptoms, etiology, extension of the disease and success rate. We 
evaluated retrospectively data about 262 patients diagnosed as SCDDT and managed 
from August 2015 to May 2022. In 44.65% cases, maxillary sinus complications 
were determined by a dental disorder; the remaining 55.34% of cases were 
iatrogenic. Patients were managed according to our multidisciplinary protocol 
including ENT, dental, and radiological evaluation. Treatments were planned with 
a personalized approach, based on the patient’s clinical characteristics; all 
patients were treated with an endonasal endoscopic mini-invasive conservative 
approach. Combined dental treatment was performed simultaneously in 152/262 
(58%) of patients; in the remaining cases, it was postponed after surgery. The 
overall treatment success rate (symptom resolution and endoscopically observed 
maxillary sinus healing) was 96.5%. At 15 days after surgery, we observed a 
significant improvement in the quality of life. The mean post-operative 
Sinonasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22) score was significantly lower compared to 
baseline (6 versus 43.4; p < 0.05). Our study showed that endoscopic sinus 
surgery can be a successful procedure for treatment of SCDDT, leading to fast 
resolution of sinonasal symptoms and improving the quality of life. Furthermore, 
the technique allows removal of migrated dental material or dental implants even 
in challenging cases.

Plazomicin is a next-generation semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that can 
be used to treat infections by multi-resistant bacteria. It is effective against 
many bacteria-producing carbapenemases or other specific hydrolases. This 
scoping review aims to define the role acquired by plazomicin from its approval 
by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) in 2018 to the present day. 
Furthermore, we aim to provide a base for a future meta-analysis. This project 
was conducted following the recommendations presented in the PRISMA extension 
for scoping reviews and the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Among 901 
potentially engaging citations, 345 duplicates were removed, and only 81 
articles were selected for the analysis. According to the data analysis, 
plazomicin has been used to treat urinary tract infections, bloodstream 
infections, and ventilation-associated pneumonia. The pathogens killed included 
multi-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and S. 
aureus. Plazomicin can be a manageable, valid non-beta-lactam alternative for 
treating multi-resistant bacteria infections.

Nitrogen (N) is a highly essential macronutrient for plant root growth and grain 
yield (GY). To assess the relationship among N, root traits, and the yield of 
boro (dry season irrigated) rice, a pot experiment was performed in the 
Department of Agronomy, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, 
Bangladesh, during the boro rice season of 2020-2021. Three boro rice varieties, 
namely BRRI dhan29, Hira-2, and Binadhan-10, were planted at four N doses: 0 kg 
ha-1 (N0), 70 kg ha-1 (N70), 140 kg ha-1 (N140), and 210 kg ha-1 (N210). The 
experiment was conducted following a completely randomized design with three 
replicates. The varieties were evaluated for root number (RN), root length (RL), 
root volume (RV), root porosity (RP), leaf area index (LAI), total dry matter 
(TDM), and yield. The results indicated that the Binadhan-10, Hira-2, and BRRI 
dhan29 varieties produced better root characteristics under at the N140 and N210 
levels. A substantial positive association was noticed between the grain yield 
and the root traits, except for root porosity. Based on the root traits and 
growth dynamics, Binadhan-10 performed the best at the N140 level and produced 
the highest grain yield (26.96 g pot-1), followed by Hira-2 (26.35 g pot-1) and 
BRRI dhan29 (25.90 g pot-1).

Charcot neuropathic arthropathy is a relatively rare, chronic disease that leads 
to joint destruction and reduced quality of life of patients. Early diagnosis of 
Charcot arthropathy is essential for a good outcome. However, the diagnosis is 
often based on the clinical course and longitudinal follow-up of patients is 
required. Charcot arthropathy is suspected in patients with suggestive symptoms 
and an underlying etiology. Failed spinal surgery is not a known cause of 
Charcot arthropathy. Herein we report a patient with ankle Charcot neuropathic 
arthropathy that developed after failed spinal surgery. A 58-year-old man 
presented to the emergency room due to painful swelling of the left ankle for 2 
weeks that developed spontaneously. He underwent spinal surgery 8 years ago that 
was associated with nerve damage, which led to weakness of great toe extension 
and ankle dorsiflexion, and sensory loss below the knee. CT and T2-weighted 
sagittal MRI showed a fine erosive lesion, subluxation, sclerosis, 
fragmentation, and large bone defects. Based on the patient's history and 
radiological findings, Charcot arthropathy was diagnosed. However, the abnormal 
blood parameters, positive blood cultures, and severe pain despite the decreased 
sensation suggested a diagnosis of septic arthritis. Therefore, diagnostic 
arthroscopy was performed. The ankle joint exhibited continued destruction after 
the initial surgery. Consequently, several repeat surgeries were performed over 
the next 2 years. Despite the early diagnosis and treatment of Charcot 
arthropathy, the destruction of the ankle joint continued. Given the chronic 
disease course and poor prognosis of Charcot arthropathy, it is essential to 
consider this diagnosis in patients with neuropathy.

Orbitocranial penetrating injuries (OPIs) caused by wooden foreign bodies (WFBs) 
are very rare and life threatening. Their diagnosis and treatment could be 
challenging for an ophthalmologist, requiring us to remain alert for possible 
intracranial extension. We present a case of a 52-year-old man with a residual 
wooden foreign body in the left frontal lobe. He had a notable history of trauma 
from a fall on a tree stump and surgical removal of a wooden foreign body from 
his left orbit 6 years ago. He was referred to us due to recurrent discharge 
from the eyelid wound. Wooden foreign body residue was successfully removed with 
a carefully planned craniotomy without complications. This case describes the 
clinical manifestation, radiographic features, and treatment of this rare 
trauma, with an emphasis on imaging diagnosis and multi-disciplinary management.

Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is a disease with multiple complications and is 
associated with poor prognosis and significant mortality. Identifying risk 
factors associated with a poor outcome is important to ensure effective 
treatment and increase life expectancy. We aimed to evaluate the predictive 
values of complications regarding mortality in ALC. We retrospectively analyzed 
1429 patients with ALC hospitalized between January 2019 and April 2022 at the 
Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Iasi. The electronic medical 
records were interrogated to obtain information about demographic data, 
complications, comorbidities, and prognostic scores: MELD-Na (model for 
end-stage liver disease-sodium) and CTP (Child−Turcotte−Pugh). Based on uni- and 
multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were identified. The 
mean age at diagnosis was 56.15 ± 11.49 years with a ratio of 2:1 in favor of 
males. There were 296 deaths (20.8%), most of them during the first 
hospitalization (208/14.6%). It was observed during the univariate analysis that 
complications of the disease negatively affected the survival rate, significant 
values being related to infections (sepsis; OR = 21.98; p < 0.001; spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis (SBP) (OR = 11.94; p < 0.001) and hepatorenal syndrome 
(HRS) (OR = 9.35; p < 0.001). The independent predictors, confirmed by 
multivariate analysis, were the association of variceal bleeding, infections, 
and hepatic encephalopathy or ascites, each combination being responsible for 
two out of 10 of the deaths during the first admission. The prognosis of the 
disease was negatively influenced by the worsening of liver dysfunction and the 
appearance of complications. The main predictors of mortality were infections, 
hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Improving 
compliance and strict application of specific follow-up and treatment strategies 
could contribute to a better prognosis of patients with alcoholic liver 
cirrhosis.

The results of the studies on the pattern of insulin sensitivity (IS) are 
contradictory in patients with GH deficiency (GHD); however, the interference of 
the GHD onset stage, childhood or adulthood in the IS has not been assessed by 
euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC), a gold-standard method for the 
assessment of insulin sensitivity. In a prospective cross-sectional study, we 
assessed IS and body composition in 17 adults with hypopituitarism without GH 
replacement, ten with childhood-onset (COGHD) and seven with adulthood-onset 
(AOGHD) and compared them to paired control groups. COGHD presented higher IS (p 
= 0.0395) and a similar percentage of fat mass (PFM) to AOGHD. COGHD showed 
higher IS than the control group (0.0235), despite a higher PFM (0.0022). No 
differences were found between AODGH and the control group. In AOGHD and the 
control group, IS was negatively correlated with PFM (rs: −0.8214, p = 0.0234 
and rs: −0.3639, p < 0.0344), while this correlation was not observed with COGHD 
(rs: −0.1152, p = 0.7514). Despite the higher PFM, patients with COGHD were more 
sensitive to insulin than paired healthy individuals, while patients with AOGHD 
showed similar IS compared to controls. The lack of GH early in life could 
modify the metabolic characteristics of tissues related to the glucose 
metabolism, inducing beneficial effects on IS that persist into adulthood. Thus, 
the glycometabolic findings in patients with COGHD seems to be not applicable to 
AOGHD.

damage during storage. Thus, the potential of rhapontigenin as a quorum sensing 
(QS) inhibitor against Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (P. 
carotovorum) was evaluated. The QS inhibitory effects of rhapontigenin were 
confirmed by significant inhibition of the production of violacein in 
Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 (C. violaceum, CV026). The inhibitory effects of 
rhapontigenin on the motility, exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, biofilm 
formation and virulence−exoenzyme synthesis of P. carotovorum were investigated. 
Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) were quantified using liquid chromatography−mass 
spectrometry (LC−MS). The inhibitory effects of rhapontigenin on the development 
of biofilms were observed using fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). A direct-inoculation assay was performed to investigate the QS 
inhibitory effects of rhapontigenin on P. carotovorum in Chinese cabbage and 
lettuce. Our results demonstrated that rhapontigenin exhibited significant 
inhibition (p < 0.05) of the motility, EPS production, biofilm formation, 
virulence−exoenzyme synthesis and AHL production of P. carotovorum. 
Additionally, the result of the direct-inoculation assay revealed that 
rhapontigenin might provide vegetables with significant shelf-life extension and 
prevent quality loss by controlling the spread of soft-rot symptoms. 
Consequently, the study provided a significant insight into the potential of 
rhapontigenin as a QS inhibitor against P. carotovorum.

A fully provided, hypocaloric, carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet 
compared to a hypocaloric conventional diabetes (CD) diet for 6 weeks improved 
glycemic control to a greater extent in face of an intended 6% weight loss in 
individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present 24-week extension 
of that study reports on the efficacy of CRHP and CD diets in a real-life 
setting. Sixty-five individuals with T2DM who completed the initial 6-week fully 
provided diet period (% energy from carbohydrate, protein, and fat was 30/30/40 
in CRHP, and 50/17/33 in CD) continued a free-living, dietician guided 24-week 
period of which 59 individuals completed. The CRHP compared to CD group reported 
a 4% lower carbohydrate intake and had higher urea excretion by 22% (both p ≤ 
0.05) at week 30, suggesting less difference in carbohydrate and protein intake 
between groups during the 24-week extension compared to week 6. The loss of body 
weight during the initial 6 weeks was maintained in both groups during the 
24-week extension (-5.5 ± 4.5 and -4.6 ± 4.8 kg) as well as HbA1c (-8.4 ± 6.2 
and -8.4 ± 6.9 mmol/mol) with no significant differences between groups. The 
additional benefits on glucoregulation harnessed by carbohydrate restriction 
under full diet provision for 6 weeks combined with titrated weight loss could 
not be maintained in a real-life setting of self-prepared diet aiming on similar 
diets for 6 months.

With the extension of the COVID-19 pandemic, the large use of COVID-19 vaccines 
among adults and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants means that the 
epidemiology of COVID-19 in pediatrics, particularly among younger children, has 
substantially changed. The prevalence of pediatric COVID-19 significantly 
increased, several severe cases among children were reported, and long-COVID in 
pediatric age was frequently observed. The main aim of this paper is to discuss 
which types of treatment are presently available for pediatric patients with 
COVID-19, which of them are authorized for the first years of life, and which 
are the most important limitations of COVID-19 therapy in pediatric age. Four 
different antivirals, remdesivir (RVD), the combination nirmatrelvir plus 
ritonavir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir (MPV), and the monoclonal antibody 
bebtelovimab (BEB), are presently approved or authorized for emergency use for 
COVID-19 treatment by most of the national health authorities, although with 
limitations according to the clinical relevance of disease and patient's 
characteristics. Analyses in the literature show that MPV cannot be used in 
pediatric age for the risk of adverse events regarding bone growth. The other 
antivirals can be used, at least in older children, and RDV can be used in all 
children except in neonates. However, careful research on pharmacokinetic and 
clinical data specifically collected in neonates and children are urgently 
needed for the appropriate management of pediatric COVID-19.

Isoorientin (ISO) is a flavonoid compound containing a luteolin structure, which 
can induce autophagy in some tumor cells. This study investigated the impact of 
ISO in gastric cancer AGS cells, and performed an experimental analysis on the 
main signaling pathways and transduction pathways it regulates. CCK-8 assay 
results showed that ISO reduced the survival rate of gastric cancer AGS cells, 
but the toxicity to normal cells was minimal. Hoechst 33342/PI double staining 
assay results showed that ISO induced apoptosis in gastric cancer AGS cells. 
Further analysis by flow cytometry and Western blot showed that ISO induced 
apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In addition, the level of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in gastric cancer AGS cells also increased with 
the extension of the ISO treatment time. However, cell apoptosis was inhibited 
by preconditioning cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Moreover, ISO arrested the 
cell cycle at the G2/M phase by increasing intracellular ROS levels. Cell 
migration assay results showed that ISO inhibited cell migration by inhibiting 
the expression of p-AKT, p-GSK-3β, and β-catenin and was also related to the 
accumulation of ROS. These results suggest that ISO-induced cell apoptosis by 
ROS-mediated MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathways inhibited cell migration by 
regulating the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer AGS 
cells.

Maltol is widely used as a flavor enhancer in baked goods and has an 
antimicrobial function. Maltol can also be incorporated into biopolymer films to 
produce active biodegradable packaging for bakery products. This research 
investigated the incorporation of 1-10% maltol into acetylated cassava starch 
films as functional packaging for shelf-life extension of butter cake. Films 
were determined for morphology, chemical interaction and packaging properties. 
Infrared absorption indicated H-bonding between starch and maltol, while 
plasticization effects decreased mechanical relaxation temperature. 
Microstructures showed enhanced smoothness at up to 3% maltol, while maltol 
crystallization occurred at higher concentrations, giving non-homogeneous 
matrices. Tensile strength and elongation at break reduced by 37% and 34%, 
respectively, with the addition of maltol up to 10%. Maltol concentration 
modified the hydrophilicity and molecular mobility of the matrices, impacting 
water vapor and oxygen permeability. Films incorporated with maltol were used as 
packaging for preservative-free butter cake and delayed visible mold growth at 
room temperature. Starch films with maltol at 1-5% delayed fungal growth by up 
to 2.7-times, while films containing 10% maltol inhibited mold growth by 6-times 
(up to 19 days of storage). Incorporating maltol into starch films produced 
bioactive materials, extending shelf-life while maintaining the aroma of bakery 
products.

World population and life expectancy have increased steadily in recent years, 
raising issues regarding access to medical treatments and related expenses. 
Through last-generation medical sensors, NFC (Near Field Communication) and 
radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies can enable healthcare 
internet of things (H-IoT) systems to improve the quality of care while reducing 
costs. Moreover, the adoption of point-of-care (PoC) testing, performed whenever 
care is needed to return prompt feedback to the patient, can generate great 
synergy with NFC/RFID H-IoT systems. However, medical data are extremely 
sensitive and require careful management and storage to protect patients from 
malicious actors, so secure system architectures must be conceived for real 
scenarios. Existing studies do not analyze the security of raw data from the 
radiofrequency link to cloud-based sharing. Therefore, two novel cloud-based 
system architectures for data collected from NFC/RFID medical sensors are 
proposed in this paper. Privacy during data collection is ensured using a set of 
classical countermeasures selected based on the scientific literature. Then, 
data can be shared with the medical team using one of two architectures: in the 
first one, the medical system manages all data accesses, whereas in the second 
one, the patient defines the access policies. Comprehensive analysis of the 
H-IoT system can be useful for fostering research on the security of wearable 
wireless sensors. Moreover, the proposed architectures can be implemented for 
deploying and testing NFC/RFID-based healthcare applications, such as, for 
instance, domestic PoCs.

Anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1) is a pathogen that causes hemorrhagic disease 
in various farmed and wild freshwater eel species, resulting in significant 
economic losses. Although AngHV-1 has been detected in the American eel 
(Anguilla rostrata), its pathogenicity has not been well characterized. In this 
study, an AngHV-1 isolate, tentatively named AngHV-1-FC, was isolated from 
diseased American eels with similar symptoms as those observed in 
AngHV-1-infected European eels and Japanese eels. AngHV-1-FC induced severe 
cytopathic effects in the European eel spleen cell line (EES), and numerous 
concentric circular virions were observed in the infected EES cells by 
transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, AngHV-1-FC caused the same symptoms 
as the naturally diseased European eels and Japanese eels through experimental 
infection, resulting in a 100% morbidity rate and 13.3% mortality rate. The 
whole genome sequence analyses showed that the average nucleotide identity value 
between AngHV-1-FC and other AngHV-1 isolates ranged from 99.28% to 99.55%. 
However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was a genetic divergence 
between AngHV-1-FC and other AngHV-1 isolates, suggesting that AngHV-1-FC was a 
new isolate of AngHV-1. Thus, our results indicated that AngHV-1-FC can infect 
farmed American eels, with a high pathogenicity, providing new knowledge in 
regard to the prevalence and prevention of AngHV-1.

A new Coronaviridae strain, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2), emerged from Wuhan city of China and caused one of the substantial 
global health calamities in December 2019. Even though several vaccines and 
drugs have been developed worldwide since COVID-19, a cost-effective drug with 
the least side effects is still unavailable. Currently, plant-derived compounds 
are mostly preferred to develop antiviral therapeutics due to its less toxicity, 
easy access, and cost-effective characteristics. Therefore, in this study, 124 
phytochemical compounds from plants of Lauraceae family with medicinal 
properties were virtually screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Identification of 
four phytomolecules, i.e., cassameridine, laetanine, litseferine and 
cassythicine, with docking scores -9.3, -8.8, -8.6, and -8.6 kcal/mol, 
respectively, were undertaken by virtual screening, and molecular docking. 
Furthermore, the molecular dynamic simulation and essential dynamics analysis 
have contributed in understanding the stability and inhibitory effect of these 
selected compounds. These phytomolecules can be considered for further in vitro 
and in vivo experimental study to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics targeting 
the main protease (Mpro).

Background: The literature on upper limb robot-assisted therapy showed that 
robot-measured metrics can simultaneously predict registered clinical outcomes. 
However, only a limited number of studies correlated pre-treatment kinematics 
with discharge motor recovery. Given the importance of predicting rehabilitation 
outcomes for optimizing physical therapy, a predictive model for motor recovery 
that incorporates multidirectional indicators of a patient's upper limb 
abilities is needed. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a 
predictive model for rehabilitation outcome at discharge (i.e., muscle strength 
assessed by the Motricity Index of the affected upper limb) based on 
multidirectional 2D robot-measured kinematics. Methods: Re-analysis of data from 
66 subjects with subacute stroke who underwent upper limb robot-assisted therapy 
with an end-effector robot was performed. Two least squares error multiple 
linear regression models for outcome prediction were developed and differ in 
terms of validation procedure: the Split Sample Validation (SSV) model and the 
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) model. In both models, the outputs were 
the discharge Motricity Index of the affected upper limb and its sub-items 
assessing elbow flexion and shoulder abduction, while the inputs were the 
admission robot-measured metrics. Results: The extracted robot-measured features 
explained the 54% and 71% of the variance in clinical scores at discharge in the 
SSV and LOOCV validation procedures respectively. Normalized errors ranged from 
22% to 35% in the SSV models and from 20% to 24% in the LOOCV models. In all 
models, the movement path error of the trajectories characterized by elbow 
flexion and shoulder extension was the significant predictor, and all 
correlations were significant. Conclusion: This study highlights that motor 
patterns assessed with multidirectional 2D robot-measured metrics are able to 
predict clinical evalutation of upper limb muscle strength and may be useful for 
clinicians to assess, manage, and program a more specific and appropriate 
rehabilitation in subacute stroke patients.

INTRODUCTION: Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) is an uncommon but 
life-threatening infectious disease. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis 
(DISH) is an age-related disorder and sometimes problematic in terms of spinal 
instability or high mortality, especially in cases of DISH-related fracture. 
Meanwhile, no reports have focused on the impact of DISH on the clinical 
outcomes after treatment for PVO. We hypothesized that PVO occurring at 
DISH-related segments might contribute to poor clinical results or high 
mortality rates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of DISH 
on mortality after treatment for PVO in a retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: This study involved patients who were hospitalized and treated for PVO 
at a single institution. DISH-related PVO was defined as PVO within a segment 
ossified by DISH or PVO at the neighboring intervertebral level of the segment 
ossified by DISH. Differences in mortality between patients with DISH-related 
and non-DISH-related PVO were investigated.
RESULTS: This study included 55 patients. DISH-related PVO was observed in 13 
patients. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with 
DISH-related PVO than in those with non-DISH-related PVO (62% and 23%, 
respectively; p=0.016). Propensity score-adjusted analysis showed that 
DISH-related PVO was an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard 
ratio, 2.79; p=0.034). The survival probability was significantly shorter in 
patients with DISH-related PVO than in those with non-DISH-related PVO 
(p=0.006). PVO in which the intravertebral body was the center of involvement 
was significantly more common in DISH-related PVO than in non-DISH-related PVO 
(38% and 5%, respectively; p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: DISH-related PVO was associated with a higher mortality rate and 
shorter life expectancy than non-DISH-related PVO. Similar to advanced age, PVO 
at the segment ossified by DISH should be recognized as a risk factor for 
mortality when choosing the optimal treatment strategy.
