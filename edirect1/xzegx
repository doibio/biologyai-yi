100-year time horizon. Nonavalent vaccination also averted an additional 1,044 
deaths over the 100-year time horizon when compared with bivalent vaccination. 
While total costs were higher for the nonavalent strategy (10.5 billion NOK 
[€1.03 billion] vs. 9.3-9.4 billion NOK [€915–925 million] for bivalent 
vaccination), switching to the nonavalent strategy resulted in a savings of 
627–694 million NOK [€62–68 million] in treatment costs compared to the bivalent 
strategy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Understanding the barriers and facilitators to intimate 
relationship development among women with physical disabilities is crucial for 
promoting positive rehabilitation outcomes. This study investigates these 
factors using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach.
METHODS: The research team utilized Consensual Qualitative Research. Consensual 
Qualitative Research is widely used in various social services to address 
limitations inherent limitations of other qualitative methods. Women with 
various physical disabilities (n=6) were identified and interviewed using a 
utilized a semi-structured interview. Their attitudes towards intimacy, outcome 
expectancy, and self-concept of women with physical disabilities were examined. 
The impact of physical disabilities, including disability stigma, on these 
factors was also assessed. Data was coded utilizing multiple researcher 
consensus as well as an auditor to consensually agree upon domains and core 
ideas while taking into account validity and trustworthiness, as per the 
methodology chosen.
RESULTS: The study discovered general themes (100% representation) concerning 
core values and barriers to intimacy, societal barriers to intimate 
relationships, and hope for future relationships. Typical themes (50-83% 
representation) included non-romantic intimacy, physical barriers to intimacy, 
perceived limitations, and negative outcome expectancies. Across the board, the 
influence of disability limitations, identity, and societal attitudes became 
evident. The role of rehabilitation professionals in advocating for social 
skills development and self-confidence enhancement emerged as crucial.
CONCLUSIONS: The study illuminated barriers to intimacy among women with 
physical disabilities, such as societal stigma and self-concept associated with 
disability. The critical role of rehabilitation professionals in normalizing 
intimacy discussions and equipping individuals with necessary social skills and 
self-confidence was underscored. This focus could yield enhanced intimate 
relationship outcomes and improve the quality of life for women with physical 
disabilities.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are still the leading cause of death worldwide. 
The improved survival of patients with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, obesity together with the extension of life expectancy contributes 
to raise the prevalence of CVD in the increasingly aged society. Therefore, a 
translational research platform that enables precise evaluation of 
cardiovascular function in healthy and disease condition and assess the efficacy 
of novel pharmacological treatments, could implement basic science and 
contribute to reduce CVD burden. Heart failure is a deadly syndrome 
characterized by the inability of the heart to meet the oxygen demands of the 
body (unless there is a compensatory increased of filling pressure) and can 
manifest either with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF). The development and progression of HFrEF is mostly 
attributable to impaired contractile performance (systole), while in HFpEF the 
main problem resides in decreased ability of left ventricle to relax and allow 
the blood filling (diastole). Murine preclinical models have been broadly used 
in research to understand pathophysiologic mechanisms of heart failure and test 
the efficacy of novel therapies. Several methods have been employed to 
characterise cardiac systolic and diastolic function including Pressure Volume 
(PV) loop hemodynamic analysis, echocardiography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI). The choice of one methodology or another depends on many aspects 
including budget available, skills of the operator and design of the study. The 
aim of this review is to discuss the importance of several methodologies that 
are commonly used to characterise the cardiovascular phenotype of preclinical 
models of heart failure highlighting advantages and limitation of each 
procedure. Although it requires highly skilled operators for execution, PV loop 
analysis represents the "gold standard" methodology that enables the assessment 
of left ventricular performance also independently of vascular loading 
conditions and heart rate, which conferee a really high physiologic importance 
to this procedure.

In apicomplexan parasites, the transition between replication and dissemination 
is regulated by fluctuations in cytosolic calcium concentrations, transduced in 
part by calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). We examined the role of 
CDPK2A in the lytic cycle of Toxoplasma, analyzing its role in the regulation of 
cellular processes associated with parasite motility. We used chemical-genetic 
approaches and conditional depletion to determine that CDPK2A contributes to the 
initiation of parasite motility through microneme discharge. We demonstrate that 
the N-terminal extension of CDPK2A is necessary for the protein's function. 
Conditional depletion revealed an epistatic interaction between CDPK2A and 
CDPK1, suggesting that the two kinases work together to mediate motility in 
response to certain stimuli. This signaling module appears distinct from that of 
CDPK3 and protein kinase G, which also control egress. CDPK2A is revealed as an 
important regulator of the Toxoplasma kinetic phase, linked to other kinases 
that govern this critical transition. Our work uncovers extensive 
interconnectedness between the signaling pathways that regulate parasite 
motility. IMPORTANCE This work uncovers interactions between various signaling 
pathways that govern Toxoplasma gondii egress. Specifically, we compare the 
function of three canonical calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) using 
chemical-genetic and conditional-depletion approaches. We describe the function 
of a previously uncharacterized CDPK, CDPK2A, in the Toxoplasma lytic cycle, 
demonstrating that it contributes to parasite fitness through regulation of 
microneme discharge, gliding motility, and egress from infected host cells. 
Comparison of analog-sensitive kinase alleles and conditionally depleted alleles 
uncovered epistasis between CDPK2A and CDPK1, implying a partial functional 
redundancy. Understanding the topology of signaling pathways underlying key 
events in the parasite life cycle can aid in efforts targeting kinases for 
anti-parasitic therapies.

In an aging US society, anticipating the challenges that future seniors will 
face is essential. This study analyzed the health and economic well-being of 
five cohorts of Americans in their mid-fifties between 1994 and 2018 using the 
Future Elderly Model, a dynamic microsimulation based on the Health and 
Retirement Study. We projected mortality, quality-adjusted life years, health 
expenditures, and income and benefits. We classified individuals by economic 
status and focused on the lower middle and upper middle of the economic 
distribution. Outcome disparities between people in these two groups widened 
substantially between the 1994 and 2018 cohorts. Quality-adjusted life 
expectancy increased (5 percent) for the upper-middle economic status group but 
stagnated for their lower-middle peers. We found that the combined value of the 
current stock (financial and housing wealth) and the present value of the 
expected flow of resources (income, health expenditures, and quality-adjusted 
life-years) after age sixty grew 13 percent for the upper-middle group between 
cohorts, whereas people in the lower-middle group in 2018 were left scarcely 
better off (3 percent growth) than their peers two decades earlier. The 
relatively neglected "forgotten middle" group of near-retirees in the 
lower-middle group may require stronger supports than are currently available to 
them.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has increased the life expectancy of people 
living with HIV. However, this increase is not free of comorbidities, and 
metabolic syndrome is one of the most prevalent. Berberine is an alkaloid 
nutraceutical that has been shown to ameliorate metabolic disorders such as 
prediabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 
However, it has not been tested in HIV infection. Therefore, we conducted a 
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of berberine in improving 
metabolic syndrome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults 
living with HIV under virological suppression and metabolic syndrome received 
either berberine 500 mg TID or placebo for 20 weeks. The primary outcomes were a 
composite of weight reduction, insulin resistance decrease, and lipid profile 
improvement. A total of 43 participants were randomized (22 in the berberine 
group and 21 in the placebo group); 36 participants completed the follow-up and 
were analyzed. The berberine group showed a reduction in weight and body mass 
index, lower insulin resistance, and a reduction in TNF-alpha. The control group 
had higher total cholesterol, c-LDL, and IL-6 concentration.
CONCLUSION: In people living with HIV under virological suppression, berberine 
was safe and improves clinical and biochemical components of metabolic syndrome. 
However, further studies with more participants and longer intervention periods 
need to be explored.

The world population is aging rapidly, and by some estimates, the number of 
people older than 60 will double in the next 30 years. With the increase in life 
expectancy, adverse effects of environmental exposures start playing a more 
prominent role in human health. Air pollution is now widely considered the most 
detrimental of all environmental risk factors, with some studies estimating that 
almost 20% of all deaths globally could be attributed to poor air quality. 
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and will 
continue to account for the most significant percentage of non-communicable 
disease burden. Cardiovascular aging with defined pathomechanisms is a major 
trigger of cardiovascular disease in old age. Effects of environmental risk 
factors on cardiovascular aging should be considered in order to increase the 
health span and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in older 
populations. In this review, we explore the effects of air pollution on 
cardiovascular aging, from the molecular mechanisms to cardiovascular 
manifestations of aging and, finally, the age-related cardiovascular outcomes. 
We also explore the distinction between the effects of air pollution on healthy 
aging and disease progression. Future efforts should focus on extending the 
health span rather than the lifespan.

BACKGROUND: There are few studies dedicated to the characterization of the 
geriatric population with psoriasis, which has particularities in terms of 
clinical manifestations and therapeutic limitations. As psoriasis is a chronic 
disease, presenting a higher prevalence with age, the increase in life 
expectancy in Brazil demands knowledge about the behavior of the disease among 
the elderly.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize elderly people with psoriasis from a tertiary 
service, from the clinical-epidemiological point of view, presence of 
comorbidities, physical frailty, and affective impact. And to compare these 
aspects with adults with psoriasis and elderly people without the disease.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 64 elderly patients with psoriasis, 64 adults 
with psoriasis, and 64 elderly patients without the disease. 
Clinical-demographic aspects, the Beck depression scale, and Skindex-16 were 
evaluated. Indicators of physical frailty were evaluated in elderly patients: 
handgrip, sit-to-stand test, fatigue, and weight loss >5%.
RESULTS: In the elderly, the mean age (SD) of psoriasis onset was 44 (10) years, 
men represented 47% of the sample, the prevalence of arthritis was 22%, and 
ungual involvement occurred in 72%. Topical corticosteroids were used more often 
among elderly people with psoriasis (100%) than among adults with the disease 
(86%), with no difference among other systemic treatments. Diabetes mellitus 
occurred in 30% of the elderly. Hypertension (59%), dyslipidemia (52%), 
depression (34%), and fatigue (59%) were more prevalent among the elderly with 
psoriasis than among the healthy controls.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: The study was carried out in a public reference service for 
patients with psoriasis, all of which were undergoing treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people with psoriasis from a tertiary service showed 
greater affective impairment, metabolic comorbidities, and physical frailty than 
elderly controls.

BACKGROUND: In 2020 COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the United 
States. Increases in suicides, overdoses, and alcohol related deaths were 
seen-which make up deaths of despair. How deaths of despair compare to COVID-19 
across racial, ethnic, and gender subpopulations is relatively unknown. 
Preliminary studies showed inequalities in COVID-19 mortality for Black and 
Hispanic Americans in the pandemic's onset. This study analyzes the racial, 
ethnic and gender disparities in years of life lost due to COVID-19 and deaths 
of despair (suicide, overdose, and alcohol deaths) in 2020.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study calculated and compared years of life lost 
(YLL) due to Deaths of Despair and COVID-19 by gender, race, and ethnicity. YLL 
was calculated using the CDC WONDER database to pull death records based on 
ICD-10 codes and the Social Security Administration Period Life Table was used 
to get estimated life expectancy for each subpopulation.
RESULTS: In 2020, COVID-19 caused 350,831 deaths and 4,405,699 YLL. By contrast, 
deaths of despair contributed to 178,598 deaths and 6,045,819 YLL. Men had more 
deaths and YLL than women due to COVID-19 and deaths of despair. Among White 
Americans and more than one race identification both had greater burden of 
deaths of despair YLL than COVID-19 YLL. However, for all other racial 
categories (Native American/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black/African American, 
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) COVID-19 caused more YLL than deaths of 
despair. Also, Hispanic or Latino persons had disproportionately higher 
mortality across all causes: COVID-19 and all deaths of despair causes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found greater deaths of despair mortality burden and 
differences in burden across gender, race, and ethnicity in 2020. The results 
indicate the need to bolster behavioral health research, support mental health 
workforce development and education, increase access to evidence-based substance 
use treatment, and address systemic inequities and social determinants of deaths 
of despair and COVID-19.

In this work, vermicompost was prepared with maize stover and cattle dung in 
ratios of 60:40 (VC1), 50:50 (VC2) and 40:60 (VC3), and the physicochemical 
properties of the vermicompost were related to the ratio of the raw materials 
used. The effect of the vermicomposts on the adsorption kinetics, adsorption 
isotherms and desorption of atrazine were investigated in unamended soil (S) and 
soil amended with 4% (w/w) of VC1(S-VC1), VC2(S-VC2) and VC3(S-VC3). The total 
organic carbon (TOC) content of VC1, VC2 and VC3 was 38.46, 37.33 and 34.47%, 
the HA content was 43.50, 42.22 and 39.28 g/kg, and the HA/FA ratios was 1.47, 
0.44 and 0.83, respectively. The adsorption of atrazine on the soil, on the 
vermicompost and on soils amended with vermicompost followed a 
pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Freundlich equation better fitted the 
adsorption isotherm of atrazine. The vermicomposts enhanced atrazine adsorption 
and decreased atrazine desorption. Correlation analysis showed that the TOC and 
HA were significantly positively correlated with Kf, which indicated that TOC 
and HA of the vermicomposts contributed significantly to the adsorption and 
desorption of atrazine. This study demonstrated that vermicomposts have great 
potential in the bioremediation of atrazine pollution and that their role is 
related to the raw materials used to prepare them.

BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is associated with various 
clinical, social and economic outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of 
MS multidisciplinary rehabilitation in Iran.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted using a Markov 
model designed to reflect the natural course of the disease and interventions. 
Parameters and variables were extracted from available evidence, and costs and 
outcomes were calculated from the social perspective. The base-case analysis 
considered a 5-year time horizon. Costs were estimated based on approved 
national standards for MS rehabilitation. Sensitivity analyses were also 
performed.
RESULTS: The average cost of the rehabilitation strategy was higher compared to 
the non-rehabilitation strategy, but it resulted in higher quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) values. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was found 
to be $2,845.8 per QALY, indicating that the rehabilitation strategy is 
cost-effective. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, extending the time 
horizon to 10 years made the rehabilitation strategy a dominant choice. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results were consistent with the base-case 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The MS multidisciplinary rehabilitation proved to be a 
cost-effective strategy; however, the results were sensitive to the input values 
of the model. Increasing the time horizon increased the probability of 
rehabilitation being cost-effective.

fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the CLN5 gene. The 
disease is characterised by progressive neuronal loss, blindness, and premature 
death. There is no cure. This study evaluated the efficacy of 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector 
encoding ovine CLN5 (scAAV9/oCLN5) in a naturally occurring sheep model of CLN5 
disease. CLN5 affected (CLN5-/-) sheep received low, moderate, or high doses of 
scAAV9/oCLN5 at three disease stages. The treatment delayed disease progression, 
extended survival and slowed stereotypical brain atrophy in most animals. Of 
note, one high dose treated animal only developed mild disease symptomology and 
survived to 60.1 months of age, triple the natural life expectancy of an 
untreated CLN5-/- sheep. Eyesight was not preserved at any administration age or 
dosage. Histopathologic examination revealed that greater transduction 
efficiency was achieved through higher ICV doses, and this resulted in greater 
amelioration of disease pathology. Together with other pre-clinical data from 
CLN5-/- sheep, the safety and efficacy data from these investigational new drug 
(IND)-enabling studies supported the initiation of the first in-human CLN5 gene 
therapy clinical study using the ICV delivery route for the treatment of CLN5 
NCL. Clinical Trial Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier 
NCT05228145.

PET-computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid imaging technique that combines 
anatomical and functional information; to investigate primary cancers, stage 
tumours, and track treatment response in paediatric oncology patients. However, 
there is debate in the literature about whether PET/CT could increase the risk 
of cancer in children, as the machine is utilizing two types of radiation, and 
paediatric patients have faster cell division and longer life expectancy. 
Therefore, it is essential to minimize radiation exposure by justifying and 
optimizing PET/CT examinations and ensure an acceptable image quality. 
Establishing diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) is a crucial quantitative 
indicator and effective tool to optimize paediatric imaging procedures. This 
review aimed to distinguish and acknowledge variations among published DRLs for 
paediatric patients in PET/CT procedures. A search of relevant articles was 
conducted using databases, that is, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline, 
using the keywords: PET-computed tomography, computed tomography, PET, 
radiopharmaceutical, DRL, and their synonyms. Only English and full-text 
articles were included, with no limitations on the publication year. After the 
screening, four articles were selected, and the review reveals different DRL 
approaches for paediatric patients undergoing PET/CT, with primary variations 
observed in patient selection criteria, reporting of radiation dose values, and 
PET/CT equipment. The study suggests that future DRL methods for paediatric 
patients should prioritize data collection in accordance with international 
guidelines to better understand PET/CT dose discrepancies while also striving to 
optimize radiation doses without compromising the quality of PET/CT images.

This video tutorial is a step-by-step demonstration of the indwelling pleural 
catheter insertion technique in a patient who was diagnosed with malignant 
pleural effusions due to multiple metastases. Placing an indwelling pleural 
catheter is a novel method to treat chronic pleural effusions, especially 
secondary to malignancies. This method is particularly useful in patients with a 
trapped lung or with reduced life expectancy in whom more-invasive procedures 
are contraindicated. Indwelling pleural catheters are well tolerated.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to quantify the association between 
body weight and health by estimating the expected lifetime with and without 
diabetes (diabetes-free life expectancy) at age 30 and 65. In addition, the 
diabetes-free life expectancy was stratified by educational level.
METHODS: Life tables by sex, level of education and obese/not obese were 
constructed using nationwide register data and self-reported data on body weight 
and height and diabetes from the Danish National Health Survey in 2021. 
Diabetes-free life expectancies were estimated by Sullivan's method.
RESULTS: The difference in life expectancy between not obese 30-year-old men 
with a long and a short education was 5.7 years. For not obese women, the 
difference was 4.1 years. For obese men and women, the difference in life 
expectancy at age 30 was 7.0 and 5.2 years. Women could expect more years 
without and fewer years with diabetes than men regardless of body weight and 
educational level. Diabetes-free life expectancy differed by 6.9 years between 
not obese 30-year-old men with a short and a long education and by 7.7 years for 
obese men with a short and a long education. For women, the differences were 5.9 
and 6.6 years.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate an association of obesity and educational 
level with life expectancy and diabetes-free life expectancy. There is a need 
for preventive efforts to reduce educational inequality in life expectancy and 
diabetes-free life expectancy. Structural intervention will particularly benefit 
overweight people with short education.

Nickel (Ni) stress adversely affects plant growth and biomass accumulation, 
posturing severe menace to crop production and food security. The current study 
aimed to determine the putative role of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in mitigating 
Ni-induced phytotoxicity and identify the underlying defense mechanisms in 
maize, which are poorly understood. Our findings showed that SNP significantly 
augmented plant growth, biomass, and photosynthesis-related attributes (Fv/Fm, 
Fm, qP ETR, and ΦPSII) through diminishing Ni uptake and translocation in root 
and shoot tissues of maize under Ni stress conditions. In parallel, exogenous 
SNP substantially relieved maize seedlings from Ni-induced stress by enhancing 
enzymatic (SOD, CAT, and GPX) and non-enzymatic (phenol and flavonoids) 
antioxidant defenses and reducing oxidative stress indicators (MDA and H2 O2 ). 
The results revealed that SNP treatment increased the content of organic 
osmolyte glycine betaine and the activity of GST, concomitantly with ATP and 
ionic exchange capacity (including Ca2+ -ATPase and Mg2+ -ATPase), advocating 
its sufficiency to promote plant growth and avert Ni-induced stress in maize 
plants. The only exception was the production of organic acids (citric, oxalic, 
malic, and formic acids), which was reduced as SNP treatment relieved maize 
seedlings from Ni-induced oxidative damage. The application of SNP also 
displayed higher expression of defense- and detoxifying-related genes than in 
control treatments. Together, our data highlighted the mechanism involved in the 
amelioration of Ni toxicity by SNP; thus, suggesting a potential role of SNP in 
mitigating the adverse effects of Ni-contaminated soils to boost growth and 
yield of crop plants, that is, maize.

BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a prevalent zoonotic disease with One Health priority 
and a disease of poverty, lacks global economic burden estimates. This study 
aims to determine the global, regional, and country-level cost of leptospirosis 
due to loss of productivity.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cost of leptospirosis due to loss of 
productivity (referred to as productivity cost hereafter) was estimated by 
converting the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to leptospirosis 
to a monetary value using the per capita gross domestic product (GDP). The 
country-specific DALYs lost were obtained from the global burden of 
leptospirosis study published previously. Non-health GDP per capita (GDP- per 
capita health expenditure) was used for the cost conversion of DALYs. 
Country-specific GDP and health expenditure data were obtained from the World 
Bank data repositories. Estimates were done using both nominal and international 
dollars. The estimated global productivity cost of leptospirosis in 2019 was 
Int$ 29.3 billion, with low and high estimates ranging from Int$ 11.6 billion to 
52.3 billion. China (Int$ 4.8 billion), India (Int$ 4.6 billion), Indonesia 
(Int$ 2.8 billion), Sri Lanka (Int$ 2.1 billion), and the United States (Int$ 
1.3 billion) had the highest productivity cost due to leptospirosis. Eight out 
of 10 countries with the highest burden were in the Asia-Pacific region. In 
addition, lower-middle-income countries had an annual productivity cost of Int$ 
13.8 billion, indicating that the disease is poverty-related.
CONCLUSION: Although significant, the cost estimate due to loss of productivity 
is merely a fraction of the overall economic burden of this disease, which also 
includes other direct, indirect, and intangible costs. The existing partial 
estimates of the different components of economic cost suggest a profound 
economic burden that demands the inclusion of leptospirosis in the global health 
agenda for comprehensive disease control and prevention efforts, including 
vaccine development.

Diabetes mellitus has become a major public health concern associated with high 
mortality and reduced life expectancy and can cause blindness, heart attacks, 
kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and strokes. A new generation of 
antidiabetic peptides (ADPs) that act on β-cells or T-cells to regulate insulin 
production is being developed to alleviate the effects of diabetes. However, the 
lack of effective peptide-mining tools has hampered the discovery of these 
promising drugs. Hence, novel computational tools need to be developed urgently. 
In this study, we present ADP-Fuse, a novel two-layer prediction framework 
capable of accurately identifying ADPs or non-ADPs and categorizing them into 
type 1 and type 2 ADPs. First, we comprehensively evaluated 22 peptide 
sequence-derived features coupled with eight notable machine learning 
algorithms. Subsequently, the most suitable feature descriptors and classifiers 
for both layers were identified. The output of these single-feature models, 
embedded with multiview information, was trained with an appropriate classifier 
to provide the final prediction. Comprehensive cross-validation and independent 
tests substantiate that ADP-Fuse surpasses single-feature models and the feature 
fusion approach for the prediction of ADPs and their types. In addition, the 
SHapley Additive exPlanation method was used to elucidate the contributions of 
individual features to the prediction of ADPs and their types. Finally, a 
user-friendly web server for ADP-Fuse was developed and made publicly accessible 
(https://balalab-skku.org/ADP-Fuse), enabling the swift screening and 
identification of novel ADPs and their types. This framework is expected to 
contribute significantly to antidiabetic peptide identification.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of perampanel 
(PER) in people with epilepsy (PWE) treated in everyday clinical practice for 
focal and generalized seizures, both in the total cohort and by age group.
METHODS: The PERMIT Extension study was a pooled analysis of data from PWE 
included in two large previous clinical practice studies (PERMIT and PROVE). 
Retention was assessed over 12 months. Effectiveness was assessed based on total 
seizures and by seizure type (focal and generalized) after 3, 6, and 12 months 
of PER treatment and at final follow-up (last observation carried forward; "last 
visit"); assessments included responder rate (≥50% seizure frequency reduction 
from baseline) and seizure freedom rate (no seizures since at least the previous 
visit). Safety/tolerability was assessed throughout PER treatment by evaluating 
adverse events (AEs). All assessments were conducted for the total population 
and by age category (<12, ≥12 to <18, ≥18 to <65, and ≥65 years at baseline).
RESULTS: Full Analysis Set included 6,822 PWE (51.1% female; mean age, 
36.9 years; mean duration of epilepsy 21.4 years) with 6,433, 4,648, and 6,233 
PWE assessed for retention, effectiveness, and safety/tolerability, 
respectively. The majority of PWE (81.1%) were aged 18-64 at baseline, with 4.5% 
aged <12 years, 8.4% aged 12-17 years, and 5.9% aged ≥65 years. In the overall 
population, retention rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 88.0%, 77.6%, and 61.4%, 
respectively; responder rates at 12 months were 58.5% for total seizures, 54.6% 
for focal seizures, and 77.7% for generalized seizures, and corresponding 
seizure freedom rates were 23.6%, 19.0%, and 51.3%, respectively. PER was 
effective regardless of age category, although effectiveness was greatest in PWE 
aged ≥65 years, for both focal and generalized seizures. In the overall 
population, the incidence of AEs was 49.2% and the most frequent AEs (≥5% of 
PWE) were dizziness/vertigo (13.4%), somnolence (8.8%), irritability (7.3%), and 
behavioral disorders (5.3%); AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 18.3% of 
PWE over 12 months. The incidence of AEs and the discontinuation rate due to AEs 
increased with increasing age (55.0% and 23.9%, respectively, in PWE aged 
≥65 years).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the largest pooled analysis of PER clinical practice 
data conducted to date, PER was shown to be effective and generally well 
tolerated when used to treat people with focal or generalized epilepsy in 
everyday clinical practice, regardless of age category. No new or unexpected 
side effects emerged following long-term use in the real-world setting.
