Purpose: Our current understanding of low-grade brainstem glioma (LGBSG) is 
still limited. This study aimed to conduct a large-scale population-based 
real-world study to understand the epidemiological characteristics of LGBSG and 
determine the predictive factors of cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall 
survival (OS) of LGBSG patients. Patients and Methods: We used Surveillance 
Epidemiology and End Results database to conduct this study of patients with 
histologically confirmed LGBSG. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and 
treatment options were compared between pediatric and adult patients. Univariate 
and multivariate analyses were employed to determine prognostic factors of CSS 
and OS. Kaplan-Meier curve and decision tree were used to confirm the prognostic 
factors. All variables were further identified by L1-penalized (Lasso) 
regression and then a nomogram was established to predict the 5- and 8-year CSS 
and OS rate. The precision of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration plots, 
Harrell's concordance index, and time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic curve. The clinical use of nomogram was estimated by decision 
curve analysis. Results: A cohort of 305 patients with LGBSG, including 165 
pediatric and 140 adult patients, was analyzed. Adult and pediatric patients 
showed different patterns concerning tumor size, tumor extension, adjuvant 
therapy, and survival rate. Univariate analysis revealed that pediatric group, 
gross total resection (GTR), World Health Organization grade II, radiotherapy, 
extension to ventricular system, and diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial 
tumor (DAOT) were significantly associated with CSS. Multivariate analysis 
showed that pediatric group, metastasis, ventricular system involvement, and 
DAOT were independently associated with CSS. The prognostic factors were further 
confirmed by Kaplan-Meier curve and decision tree. Kaplan-Meier curve also 
showed that adjuvant therapy added no benefits in patients with GTR and non-GTR. 
In addition, the nomogram was developed and the C-index of internal validation 
for CSS was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96). Conclusion: This study shows that 
pediatric and adult patients have different tumor characteristics, treatment 
options, and survival rate. Pediatric group, DAOT, ventricular system 
involvement, and metastasis were identified as independent prognostic factors 
for CSS by multivariate analysis. Adjuvant therapy showed no benefits on CSS in 
patients with GTR and non-GTR. The nomogram was discriminative and clinically 
useful.

BACKGROUND: The therapeutic landscape for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients that have common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has 
changed radically in the last decade. The availability of these treatment 
options has an economic impact, therefore a budget impact analysis was 
performed.
METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted from a Dutch healthcare 
perspective over a 5-year time horizon in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving 
first-line afatinib (Gilotrif®) versus first-line osimertinib (Tagrisso®), 
followed by subsequent treatments. A decision analysis model was constructed in 
Excel. Scenario analyses and one-way sensitivity analysis were used to test the 
models' robustness.
RESULTS: Sequential treatment with afatinib versus first-line treatment with 
osimertinib showed mean total time on treatment (ToT) of 29.1 months versus 24.7 
months, quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) of 20.2 versus 17.4 with mean cost 
of €108,166 per patient versus €143,251 per patient, respectively. The 5-year 
total budget impact was €110.4 million for the afatinib sequence versus €158.6 
million for the osimertinib sequence, leading to total incremental cost savings 
of €48.15 million.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line afatinib treatment in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC 
had a lower financial impact on the Dutch healthcare budget with a higher mean 
ToT and QALM compared to osimertinib sequential treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines suggest a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
target of ≤ 6.5% for type 2 diabetes patients with short duration of disease, 
few comorbidities and/or long life expectancy-provided this goal can be achieved 
safely. We explored whether initial combination treatment with the dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin and metformin could provide better glycemic 
control (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) than metformin alone without increasing hypoglycemia.
METHODS: We pooled and analyzed individual patient data from two randomized 
clinical trials of early combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin 
versus metformin monotherapy. The primary outcome in both trials was the change 
in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. We evaluated the percentage of patients who 
achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% at week 24 and the incidence of adverse events.
RESULTS: Most (> 70%) of the 1160 patients analyzed were treatment naive, and 
more than half had had diabetes for ≤ 1 year; mean baseline HbA1c was 
approximately 8.7%. Combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin resulted 
in more patients achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.5% than metformin alone, both for a 
metformin dose of 500 mg (40.1 vs. 22.9%, respectively, odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87-4.32) and 1000 mg (49.5 vs. 35.4%, 
respectively, OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.54-3.40). Hypoglycemia occurred in < 3% of 
patients, with a comparable incidence between treatment groups. Other adverse 
events were also balanced between groups.
CONCLUSION: Early combination treatment with linagliptin and metformin can 
improve the chances of achieving tight glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) without 
increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or other adverse events.

We recorded the survival of 141 patients assessed for radical cystectomy, which 
included cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The median Kaplan-Meier survival 
estimates were: 1540 days for the whole cohort; 2200 days after cystectomy 
scheduled (n = 108); and 843 days without surgery. The mortality hazard remained 
double that expected for a matched general population, but survival was better 
in patients scheduled for surgery than those who were not: the mortality hazard 
ratio (95%CI) after cystectomy was 0.43 (0.26-0.73) the mortality hazard without 
surgery, p = 0.001. The mortality hazard ratios for the three-variable Bayesian 
Model Averaging survival model for all 141 patients were: referral for surgery 
(0.5); haemoglobin concentration (0.98); and efficiency of carbon dioxide output 
(1.05). Efficiency of carbon dioxide output was the single variable in the 
postoperative model (n = 108), mortality hazard 1.08 (per unit increase). The 
ratio of observed to expected peak oxygen consumption associated best with 
mortality in 33 patients not referred for surgery, hazard ratio 0.001. Our 
results can inform consultations with patients with invasive bladder cancer and 
suggest that interventions to increase fitness and haemoglobin may improve 
survival in patients who do and who do not undergo radical cystectomy.

With the technical developments in neurosurgery, increasing numbers of 
neurosurgical implants are used in an increasingly aged population of patients 
with several comorbidities. Consequently, the number of neurosurgical 
implant-associated infections is continuously raising, resulting in significant 
morbidity and mortality, including disfiguring skull deformities and lack of 
brain protection. In this article we review infections associated with 
craniotomy, cranioplasty, neurostimulators, internal cerebrospinal fluid shunts, 
and external ventricular and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainages. In all 
implant-associated infections biofilms are involved, which are difficult to 
eradicate. A low number of microorganisms is sufficient to form a biofilm on the 
implant surface. In most infections, microorganisms of the skin flora are 
involved. Microorganisms reach the implant during surgery or immediately 
thereafter as a result of wound healing disturbances. In about two thirds of 
patients, implant-associated infections manifest early (within the first month 
after surgery), whereas the remaining infections present later as a result of 
low-grade infections or by direct extension from adjacent infections (per 
continuitatem) to the implants due to soft tissue damage. Except for 
ventriculo-atrial cerebrospinal fluid shunts, neurosurgical implants are rarely 
infected by the haematogenous route. In this article we review established and 
clinically validated concepts for the management of biofilm-associated 
infections in orthopaedic and trauma surgery, which can be extrapolated to other 
surgical disciplines that use implants. However, the evidence for the success of 
this extrapolation to neurosurgical patients is sparse and has not been 
evaluated in large patient populations. For favourable outcome, an optimised 
microbiological diagnosis including sonication of removed implants and prolonged 
incubation of cultures is required. Furthermore, a combined surgical and 
antimicrobial management strategy is needed. Surgery includes an appropriate 
debridement with or without implant exchange or removal, depending on the age of 
the biofilm and the soft tissue condition. Antimicrobial treatment includes a 
prolonged biofilm-active therapy, typically for 4&ndash;12 weeks. This concept 
is attractive, because in selected patients, implants can be retained or 
exchanged in a one-stage surgical procedure, which improves not only quality of 
life, but also decreases morbidity because every additional neurosurgical 
intervention can lead to secondary complications, including intracerebral 
bleeding or ischemia.

Algal products are well known for their health promoting effects. Nonetheless, 
an in depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still only 
fragmentary. Here, we show that aqueous furbelow extracts (brown algae, 
Saccorhiza polyschides) lengthen the life of both sexes of the fruit fly 
Drosophila melanogaster substantially, if used as nutritional additives to 
conventional food. This life prolonging effect became even more pronounced in 
the presence of stressors, such as high-fat dieting of living under drought 
conditions. Application of the extracts did not change food intake, excretion, 
or other major physiological parameters. Nevertheless, effects on the intestinal 
microbiota were observed, leading to an increased species richness, which is 
usually associated with healthy conditions. Lifespan extension was not observed 
in target of rapamycin (TOR)-deficient animals, implying that functional TOR 
signaling is necessary to unfold the positive effects of brown algae extract 
(BAE) on this important trait. The lack of life lengthening in animals with 
deregulated TOR signaling exclusively targeted to body fat showed that this 
major energy storage organ is instrumental for transmitting these effects. In 
addition, expression of Imaginal morphogenesis protein-Late 2 (Imp-L2), an 
effective inhibitor of insulin signaling implies that BAE exerts their positive 
effects through interaction with the tightly interwoven TOR- and 
insulin-signaling systems, although insulin levels were not directly affected by 
this intervention.
