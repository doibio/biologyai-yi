(NCT01148017). We assessed by hSBA and rSBA the persistence of antibody 
responses to serogroups ACWY in 203 healthy 60-month-olds receiving 4 doses of 
MenACWY-CRM during infancy (ACWY-4 group), or 2 doses at 12/13 and 15 months or 
1 dose at 18 months of age (ACWY-2 group). We administered a MenACWY-CRM dose to 
224 primed and 45 naïve 60-month-olds and evaluated safety and antibody response 
1 month later.
RESULTS: Antibody persistence measured by both assays was higher in primed than 
naïve 60-month-olds. The percentages of primed children with hSBA titers ≥8 was 
low for serogroup A (6-25%) and moderate for serogroups C (27-43%), Y (69-74%) 
and W (56-69%). For all serogroups, hSBA antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) 
tended to be higher in the ACWY-2 than the ACWY-4 group. Post-booster/single 
dose, ≥96% of primed and ≥73% of naïve children had hSBA titers ≥8 against each 
serogroup, and hSBA GMTs were higher in primed children. The booster dose was 
well-tolerated and no safety concern was identified. We further assessed 
persistence using rSBA across different age groups and detected no overall 
correlation between rSBA and hSBA titers.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary vaccination of infants/toddlers with MenACWY-CRM resulted 
in moderate antibody persistence against serogroups C, W and Y for up to 4 years 
after the last priming dose. Regardless of priming schedule, a MenACWY-CRM 
booster dose at 60 months of age induced a robust immune response against all 
serogroups and was well-tolerated in all children.

Post-acute consequences currently form a significant component of the dengue 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) burden estimates. However, there is 
considerable uncertainty regarding the incidence, duration, and severity of 
these symptoms. Further research is needed to more accurately estimate the 
health and economic burden of these dengue manifestations.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Our current study aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms of 
citronellol-induced cell death and ROS accumulation in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NCI-H1299 cells) and also compare the anticancer effects of citronellol 
and EOPC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ROS measurement and western blotting were performed to 
detect whether citronellol can induce necroptosis in vitro. Besides, we 
performed an in vivo analysis of tumourigenesis inhibition by citronellol 
treatment in BALB/c (nu/nu) nude mice.
RESULTS: Necroptosis occured by up-regulating TNF-α, RIP1/RIP3 activities, and 
down-regulating caspase-3/caspase-8 activities after citronellol treatment in 
NCI-H1299 cells. Citronellol also resulted in a biphasic increase in ROS 
production at 1 h and at 12 h in NCI-H1299 cells. Xenograft model experiments 
showed that citronellol could effectively inhibit subcutaneous tumours produced 
4 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of NCI-H1299 in BALB/c nude mice.
CONCLUSION: Citronellol induced necroptosis of NCI-H1299 cells via TNF-α pathway 
and ROS accumulation.

BACKGROUND: Compared to men, women live longer but have more years with 
disability. We assessed the contribution of gender differences in mortality and 
disability, total and by cause, to women's excess unhealthy life years (ULYs).
METHODS: We used mortality data for France 2008 from Eurostat, causes of death 
from the CépiDc-INSERM-database; and disability and chronic conditions data from 
the French Disability Health Survey 2008-09. ULYs were calculated by the 
Sullivan method. The contributions of mortality and disability differences to 
gender differences in ULY were based on decomposition analyses.
RESULTS: Life expectancy of French women aged 50 was 36.3 years of which 19.0 
were ULYs; life expectancy of men was 30.4 years of which 14.2 were ULYs. Of the 
4.8 excess ULYs in women, 4.0 years were due to lower mortality. Of these 4.0 
ULYs, 1.8 ULY originated from women's lower mortality from cancer, 0.8 ULY from 
heart disease and 0.3 ULY from accidents. The remaining 0.8 excess ULY in women 
were from higher disability prevalence, including higher disability from 
musculoskeletal diseases (+1.8 ULY) and anxiety-depression (+0.6 ULY) partly 
offset by lower disability from heart diseases (-0.8 ULY) and accidents (-0.3 
ULY).
CONCLUSION: Lower mortality and higher disability prevalence contributed to 
women's longer life expectancy with disability. Women's higher disability 
prevalence due to non-fatal disabling conditions was partly offset by lower 
disability from heart disease and accidents. Conditions differentially impact 
gender differences in ULY, depending on whether they are mainly life-threatening 
or disabling. The conclusions confirm the health-survival paradox.

BACKGROUND: A previous cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) showed that 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) 10 and PCV13 were not cost-effective for 
universal immunization among children in Thailand. Given recent changes in the 
evidence of efficacy, herd effects and price, a CEA of PCVs should be revisited. 
This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of PCV10 and PCV13 compared 
to no PCV vaccination in Thai children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed under a societal perspective 
with a lifetime horizon. Inputs were derived from a comprehensive literature 
review. Costs were calculated using the Thai National Electronic Database and 
converted to the year 2017 value. All costs and outcomes were discounted at a 
rate of 3%. The findings were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) in Thai Baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve 
was generated with the cost-effectiveness threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis of 2 + 1 dose schedule and five-year protection, 
with no consideration of herd effect showed that ICER for PCV10 was 170,437 
THB/QALY, while ICER for PCV13 was 73,674 THB/QALY. With consideration of herd 
effect, both PCV10 and PCV13 had lower costs and higher QALYs compared to no PCV 
vaccination. Based on our probabilistic sensitivity analysis at 
willingness-to-pay of 160,000 THB/QALY, PCV13 had 93% of being cost-effective, 
while 4.7% and 2.3%, for PCV10 and no PCV vaccination, respectively.
CONCLUSION: At current prices, PCV13 is cost-effective, while PCV10 is not 
cost-effective in Thailand. When considering herd-effect, both PCV10 and PCV13 
are cost-effective.

Sarcopenia is characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength, and function 
with ageing. With increasing life expectancy, greater attention has been given 
to counteracting the effects of sarcopenia on the growing elderly population. 
Chlorella vulgaris, a microscopic, unicellular, green alga with the potential 
for various pharmaceutical uses, has been widely studied in this context. This 
study is aimed at determining the effects of C. vulgaris on promoting muscle 
regeneration by evaluating myoblast regenerative capacity in vitro. Human 
skeletal myoblast cells were cultured and underwent serial passaging into young 
and senescent phases and were then treated with C. vulgaris, followed by the 
induction of differentiation. The ability of C. vulgaris to promote myoblast 
differentiation was analysed through cellular morphology, real-time monitoring, 
cell proliferation, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) expression, 
myogenic differentiation, myogenin expression, and cell cycle profiling. The 
results obtained showed that senescent myoblasts exhibited an enlarged and 
flattened morphology, with increased SA-β-gal expression, reduced myogenic 
differentiation, decreased expression of myogenin, and an increased percentage 
of cells in the G 0/G 1 phase. Treatment with C. vulgaris resulted in decreased 
SA-β-gal expression and promotion of myogenic differentiation, as observed via 
an increased fusion index, maturation index, myotube size, and surface area and 
an increased percentage of cells that stained positive for myogenin. In 
conclusion, C. vulgaris improves the regenerative capacity of young and 
senescent myoblasts and promotes myoblast differentiation, indicating its 
potential to promote muscle regeneration.

With the life expectancy increasing, older adult population has gained the 
attention of many researchers. Aging is known to lead to a general decline in 
bodily functions, which affect the quality of life. The aim of this study was to 
analyze how the aging process affects veteran active karate practitioners, in 
the kinematic and temporal structure of the frontal kick. Nine black belt karate 
practitioners over 50 years old and 24 black belt karate practitioners, aged 
between 20 and 30 years old, all male, performed the frontal kick mae-geri. 
Results showed that knee is the structure that holds most differences between 
young and veterans, both for linear and for angular variables during the 
mae-geri performance. Statistical differences were found in linear velocity for 
the knee; linear acceleration of the knee, hip, and RASIS; maximum angular 
velocity for knee and hip; maximum angular acceleration for ankle and hip; and 
in the range of motion of knee. The temporal variables show differences, between 
groups, in maximum linear velocity, maximum linear acceleration, and maximum 
angular acceleration. However, no differences were found between groups for the 
time before contact in the maximum linear and angular acceleration, which allow 
us to remark both the effects of the aging process and the effect of training. 
This study corroborates the ability of older people to achieve benefits from 
sports practice, achieving higher efficiency than the younger adults in task 
execution, but using different motor control strategies.

Introduction: The Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Narrative is a global initiative to 
engage patients with UC, in order to help identify the impact of UC on patients' 
lives. The aim of the UC Narrative extension survey in Finland was to identify 
and describe the unmet needs in quality care. Methods: Seventeen Finnish 
physicians were surveyed in the original UC Narrative survey between 7 December 
2017 and 24 January 2018. In the extension phase, Finnish UC patients, recruited 
through the Finnish patient association, were surveyed from 15 November to 3 
December 2018, covering questions on disease characteristics, impact on life, 
most common challenges in communication with health care professionals (HCPs) 
and access to care. Results: Five hundred and eight patients with self-reported 
UC diagnosis participated (137 male [27.0%]). Diagnostic delay was, on average, 
2.3 (SD 5.5) years; 14.4% had waited five years or more for diagnosis. Most 
patients (396; 78.0%) considered themselves to be in remission and rated their 
overall state of health as 'excellent' or 'good' (303; 59.7%). Most patients 
(79.6%) were satisfied with the communication with their HCPs, and the majority 
(74.2%) felt comfortable raising concerns and fears with HCPs. However, the 
satisfaction in discussing mental and emotional health impacts of UC was lower 
(44.3%). A relatively large number of patients (38.5%) felt that they would be a 
more successful person without UC. Conclusions: The UC Narrative survey 
highlighted the diagnostic delay in UC, challenges in communication with HCPs 
and the impact of UC on life from the patients' perspective.

Long-chain n-3 fatty acids as an essential link between musculoskeletal and 
cardio-metabolic health in older adults.

This narrative review aims to critically evaluate scientific evidence exploring 
the therapeutic role(s) of long-chain n-3 PUFA in the context of ageing, and 
specifically, sarcopenia. We highlight that beyond impairments in physical 
function and a lack of independence, the age-related decline in muscle mass has 
ramifications for cardio-metabolic health. Specifically, skeletal muscle is 
crucial in regulating blood glucose homeostasis (and by extension reducing type 
2 diabetes mellitus risk) and providing gluconeogenic precursors that are 
critical for survival during muscle wasting conditions (i.e. AIDS). Recent 
interest in the potential anabolic action of n-3 PUFA is based on findings from 
experimental studies that measured acute changes in the stimulation of muscle 
protein synthesis (MPS) and/or chronic changes in muscle mass and strength in 
response to fish oil-derived n-3 PUFA supplementation. Key findings include a 
potentiated response of MPS to amino acid provision or resistance-based exercise 
with n-3 PUFA in healthy older adults that extrapolated to longer-term changes 
in muscle mass and strength. The key mechanism(s) underpinning this enhanced 
response of MPS remains to be fully elucidated, but is likely driven by the 
incorporation of exogenous n-3 PUFA into the muscle phospholipid membrane and 
subsequent up-regulation of cell signalling proteins known to control MPS. In 
conclusion, multiple lines of evidence suggest that dietary n-3 PUFA provide an 
essential link between musculoskeletal and cardio-metabolic health in older 
adults. Given that western diets are typically meagre in n-3 PUFA content, 
nutritional recommendations for maintaining muscle health with advancing age 
should place greater emphasis on dietary n-3 PUFA intake.

To extend life expectancy and ensure healthy aging, it is crucial to prevent and 
minimize age-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, also known as sarcopenia. However, 
the disease's molecular mechanism remains unclear. The age-related Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway has been recently shown to be activated by the (pro)renin 
receptor ((P)RR). We report here that (P)RR expression was increased in the 
atrophied skeletal muscles of aged mice and humans. Therefore, we developed a 
gain-of-function model of age-related sarcopenia via transgenic expression of 
(P)RR under control of the CAG promoter. Consistent with our hypothesis, 
(P)RR-Tg mice died early and exhibited muscle atrophy with histological features 
of sarcopenia. Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated and the 
regenerative capacity of muscle progenitor cells after cardiotoxin injury was 
impaired due to cell fusion failure in (P)RR-Tg mice. In vitro forced expression 
of (P)RR protein in C2C12 myoblast cells suppressed myotube formation by 
activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Administration of Dickkopf-related protein 
1, an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and anti-(P)RR neutralizing 
antibody, which inhibits binding of (P)RR to the Wnt receptor, significantly 
improved sarcopenia in (P)RR-Tg mice. Furthermore, the use of anti-(P)RR 
neutralizing antibodies significantly improved the regenerative ability of 
skeletal muscle in aged mice. Finally, we show that Yes-associated protein (YAP) 
signaling, which is coordinately regulated by Wnt/β-catenin, contributed to the 
development of (P)RR-induced sarcopenia. The present study demonstrates the use 
of (P)RR-Tg mice as a novel sarcopenia model, and shows that (P)RR-Wnt-YAP 
signaling plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

IMPORTANCE: Prognostic understanding can shape patients' treatment goals and 
preferences. Patients undergoing dialysis in the United States have limited life 
expectancy and may receive end-of-life care directed at life extension. Little 
is known about their prognostic expectations.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the prognostic expectations of patients undergoing 
dialysis and how these relate to care planning, goals, and preferences.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional survey study of 996 eligible 
patients treated with regular dialysis at 31 nonprofit dialysis facilities in 2 
metropolitan areas (Seattle, Washington, and Nashville, Tennessee) between April 
2015 and October 2018. After a pilot phase, 1434 eligible patients were invited 
to participate (response rate, 69.5%). To provide a context for interpreting 
survey participants' prognostic estimates, United States Renal Data System 
standard analysis files were used to construct a comparison cohort of 307 602 
patients undergoing in-center hemodialysis on January 1, 2006, and followed for 
death through July 31, 2017. Final analyses for this study were conducted 
between November 2018 and March 2019.
EXPOSURES: Responses to the question "How long would you guess people your age 
with similar health conditions usually live?" (<5 years, 5-10 years, >10 years, 
or not sure).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported (1) documentation of a surrogate 
decision-maker, (2) documentation of treatment preferences, (3) values around 
life prolongation, (4) preferences for receipt of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
and mechanical ventilation, and (5) desired place of death.
RESULTS: Of the 996 survey respondents, the mean (SD) age was 62.7 (13.9) years, 
and 438 (44.0%) were women. Overall, 112 (11.2%) survey respondents selected a 
prognosis of fewer than 5 years, 150 (15.1%) respondents selected 5 to 10 years, 
330 (33.1%) respondents selected more than 10 years, and 404 (40.6%) were not 
sure. By comparison, 185 427 (60.3%) prevalent US in-center patients undergoing 
hemodialysis died within 5 years, 58 437 (19.0%) died within 5 to 10 years, and 
63 738 (20.7%) lived more than 10 years. In analyses adjusted for participant 
characteristics, survey respondents with a prognostic expectation of more than 
10 years (vs <5 years) were less likely to report documentation of a surrogate 
decision-maker (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) and treatment 
preferences (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6) and to value comfort over life extension 
(aOR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.04-0.3), and were more likely to want cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (aOR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.2-8.7) and mechanical ventilation (aOR, 2.2; 
95% CI, 1.2-3.7). The respondents who reported that they were not sure about 
prognosis had similar associations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Uncertain and overly optimistic prognostic 
expectations may limit the benefit of advance care planning and contribute to 
high-intensity end-of-life care in patients undergoing dialysis.

The prevalence of diabetes is on the rise worldwide especially in developed 
countries. The aim of glucose management in all types of diabetes is to minimize 
chronic and acute complications associated with diabetes. All patients with type 
1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) require insulin. Main areas of technology advances in 
diabetes are continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and also continuous 
glucose monitoring systems for the management of patients with both types of 
diabetes. It is very important to analyse the epidemiological situation within 
each country before and during the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) 
development and implementation. The analyses will allow us to monitor the effect 
of the CPG after its implementation.The aim of this short communication is to 
analyse the epidemiology of prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus and 
use of CSII to inform development of CPGs in the Czech Republic.The analysis is 
developed based on the data managed by Institute of Health Information and 
Statistics of the Czech Republic. We used the National Register of Reimbursed 
Health Services 2015-2017 as primary source, and the annual report type A 
(Ministry of Health) 1-01: for Diabetology (A MH 004) 2007-2017 was used as 
validation source. The presented data are related to the year 2016 because we 
were able to validate them based on the data from 2015 to 2017 for this cohort 
of patients.The number of patients with T1DM is increasing in the Czech Republic 
with no significant sex difference. Life expectancy is about 11 years lower in 
the T1DM population. The majority of the patients are in older age; however, 
these are not treated with CSII compared with the younger population. From 
61 533 patients with T1DM, 81% were reported with acute and chronic 
complications in 2016. Only 5011 of these patients were reported as using CSII.

Osteosarcoma is a relatively uncommon diagnosis that often requires limb salvage 
techniques in young patients. Due to the potential long-life expectancy of these 
patients, techniques which avoid prostheses are preferred to limit the need for 
future revision surgeries. This case report presents a 9-year-old male diagnosed 
with intramedullary well-differentiated osteosarcoma of the tibial diaphysis. 
This limb salvage procedure utilized a rotational ipsilateral vascularized 
double barrel fibula autograft measuring a total of 24.5 cm when harvested but 
osteotomized to lengths of 11 and 12.5 cm limbs to reconstruct an 11 cm tibial 
shaft defect. Anterior chamfer cuts were performed on one limb allowing it to be 
inserted intramedullary while the second limb was then placed with an inlay 
technique posterolaterally and then compressed with a carbon fiber plate. The 
patient recovered well initially postoperatively but was taken back for revision 
of the carbon fiber plate 10 weeks postoperatively secondary to asymptomatic 
loosening of the proximal screws. The patient subsequently healed and 
experienced full graft incorporation with expected hypertrophy of the graft. At 
most recent follow-up at 19 months, the patient reported no pain and was 
utilizing the extremity in a normal fashion with no activity limitations. In 
this report, we present a case of the use of an ipsilateral rotational 
double-barrel fibula autograft for limb salvage in a pediatric patient with 
lower extremity intramedullary osteosarcoma.

Aflatoxin is a fungal secondary metabolite with high toxicity that is capable of 
contaminating various types of food crops. It has been identified as a Group 1 
human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Chronic 
aflatoxin exposure has caused worldwide concern as a matter of public food 
safety. Peanuts and peanut products are the major sources of aflatoxin exposure. 
Therefore, some reduction interventions have been developed to minimize 
contamination throughout the peanut production chain. The purpose of this study 
is to estimate the efficacy of interventions in reducing the health impact of 
hepatocellular carcinoma caused by aflatoxin contamination in peanuts. The 
estimated total Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated using 
FDA-iRISK software. Six aflatoxin reduction strategies were evaluated, including 
good agricultural practice (GAP), biocontrol, Purdue Improved Crop Storage 
packaging, basic processing, ozonolysis, and ultraviolet irradiation. The 
results indicated that basic processing could prevent huge public health loss of 
4,079.7-21,833 total DALYs per year. In addition, GAP and biocontrol were both 
found to be effective strategies in the farm field. Meanwhile, the other three 
interventions had limited effectiveness in reducing total DALYs. In conclusion, 
this study could help farmers, processing plants, and government policy makers 
to alleviate aflatoxin contamination issues in the peanut production chain.

BACKGROUND: Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the environmental 
bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is often fatal, with a high prevalence 
in tropical areas. Clinical presentation can vary from abscess formation to 
pneumonia and sepsis. We assessed the global burden of melioidosis, expressed in 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), for 2015.
METHODS: We did a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature for human 
melioidosis cases between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2015. Quantitative data for 
cases of melioidosis were extracted, including mortality, age, sex, infectious 
and post-infectious sequelae, antibiotic treatment, and symptom duration. These 
data were combined with established disability weights and expert panel 
discussions to construct an incidence-based disease model. The disease model was 
integrated with established global incidence and mortality estimates to 
calculate global melioidosis DALYs. The study is registered with PROSPERO, 
number CRD42018106372.
FINDINGS: 2888 articles were screened, of which 475 eligible studies containing 
quantitative data were retained. Pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, and sepsis 
were the most common outcomes, with pneumonia occurring in 3633 (35·7%, 95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] 34·8-36·6) of 10 175 patients, intra-abdominal abscess 
in 1619 (18·3%, 17·5-19·1) of 8830 patients, and sepsis in 1526 (18·0%, 
17·2-18·8) of 8469 patients. We estimate that in 2015, the global burden of 
melioidosis was 4·6 million DALYs (UI 3·2-6·6) or 84·3 per 100 000 people 
(57·5-120·0). Years of life lost accounted for 98·9% (UI 97·7-99·5) of the total 
DALYs, and years lived with disability accounted for 1·1% (0·5-2·3).
INTERPRETATION: Melioidosis causes a larger disease burden than many other 
tropical diseases that are recognised as neglected, and so it should be 
reconsidered as a major neglected tropical disease.

Cancer specialists and geriatricians can struggle to find the best form for 
their collaboration within geriatric oncology and do not always benefit 
optimally from the experience and knowledge the other has to offer. To optimize 
the yield of a geriatric consultation for older patients with cancer, the 
geriatrician needs to know the specific purpose of the consultation, the 
expected disease trajectory, and some information on the potential benefits and 
risks of treatment options including best supportive care only. The geriatrician 
should subsequently focus primarily on the patient, their preferences and 
priorities with regards to oncologic and non-oncologic outcomes and assess their 
overall health status through a geriatric assessment that includes at minimum 
comorbidities, medication review, basic and instrument activities of daily 
living, mobility, falls, nutritional status, cognition, mood and social support. 
Reporting back to the cancer specialist should be concise, objective whenever 
possible and to the point. Within the multidisciplinary team, the geriatrician 
can contribute with information on health status and reserves, remaining 
life-expectancy and toxicity risks, and by creating awareness of the limitations 
of evidence regarding the older population. This will help in reaching a 
well-tailored treatment decision that balances cancer-related and 
patient-centred outcome measures and fits within the patient's own preferences 
for treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an inflammatory biomarker and 
clinical symptom directed tight control strategy (TC) compared with 
symptom-based clinical management (CM) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) 
naïve to immunosuppressants and biologics using a UK public payer perspective.
DESIGN: A regression model estimated weekly CD Activity Index (CDAI)-based 
transition matrices (remission: CDAI <150, moderate: CDAI ≥150 to <300, severe: 
CDAI ≥300 to <450, very severe: CDAI ≥450) based on the Effect of Tight Control 
Management on Crohn's Disease (CALM) trial. A regression predicted 
hospitalisations. Health utilities and costs were applied to health states. Work 
productivity was monetised and included in sensitivity analyses. Remission rate, 
CD-related hospitalisations, adalimumab injections, other direct medical costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) were calculated.
RESULTS: Over 48 weeks, TC was associated with a higher clinical remission (CDAI 
<150) rate (58.2% vs 46.8%), fewer CD-related hospitalisations (0.124 vs 0.297 
events per patient) and more injections of adalimumab (40 mg sc) (mean 31.0 vs 
24.7) than CM. TC was associated with 0.032 higher QALYs and £593 higher total 
medical costs. The ICER was £18 656 per QALY. The ICER was cost-effective in 
57.9% of simulations. TC became dominant, meaning less costly but more 
effective, when work productivity was included.
CONCLUSION: A TC strategy as used in the CALM trial is cost-effective compared 
with CM. Incorporating costs related to work productivity increases the economic 
value of TC. Cross-national inferences from this analysis should be made with 
caution given differences in healthcare systems.
