Tobacco smoke residues lingering in the indoor environment, also termed 
thirdhand smoke (THS), can be a source of long-term exposure to harmful 
pollutants. THS composition is affected by chemical transformations and by 
air-surface partitioning over time scales of minutes to months. This study 
identified and quantified airborne THS pollutants available for respiratory 
exposure, identified potential environmental tracers, and estimated health 
impacts to nonsmokers. In a ventilated 18 m(3) laboratory chamber, six 
cigarettes were machine-smoked, and levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and 58 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored during an aging period of 18 h. 
Results were compared with field measurements taken in a smoker's home 8 h after 
the last cigarette had been smoked. Initial chamber levels of individual VOCs in 
freshly emitted secondhand smoke (SHS) were in the range of 1-300 μg m(-3). The 
commonly used SHS tracers 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP) and nicotine were no longer 
present in the gas phase after 2 h, likely due mostly to sorption to surfaces. 
By contrast, other VOCs persisted in the gas phase for at least 18 h, 
particularly furans, carbonyls, and nitriles. The concentration ratio of 
acetonitrile to 3-EP increased substantially with aging. This ratio may provide 
a useful metric for differentiating freshly emitted (SHS) from aged smoke (THS). 
Among the 29 VOCs detected in the smoker's home at moderate to high 
concentrations, 18 compounds were also detected in simultaneously sampled 
outdoor air, but acetonitrile, 2-methyl furan, and 2,5-dimethyl furan appeared 
to be specific to cigarette smoke. The levels of acrolein, methacrolein, and 
acrylonitrile exceeded concentrations considered harmful by the State of 
California. An initial exposure and impact assessment was conducted for a subset 
of pollutants by computing disability-adjusted life years lost, using available 
toxicological and epidemiological information. Exposure to PM2.5 contributed to 
more than 90% of the predicted harm. Acrolein, furan, acrylonitrile, and 
1,3-butadiene were considered to be the most harmful VOCs. Depending on which 
criteria are used to establish the separation between SHS and THS, 5-60% of the 
predicted health damage could be attributed to THS exposure. Benefits and 
limitations of this approach are discussed.

Special needs: caring for the older adult with Down syndrome.

Herron-Foster BJ, Bustos JJ.

Over the last 30 years, the life expectancy of people with Down syndrome has 
increased dramatically. Significant medical advances have allowed affected 
persons to be seen more in the hospital setting, making it imperative that 
nurses understand their health care needs in order to provide positive health 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: In modern operating rooms, clean and unused medical supplies are 
routinely discarded and can be effectively recovered and redistributed abroad to 
alleviate the environmental burden of donor hospitals and to generate 
substantial health benefits at resource-poor recipient institutions.
METHODS: We established a recovery and donation program to collect clean and 
unused supplies for healthcare institutions in developing nations. We analyzed 
items donated over a 3-year period (September 2010-November 2013) by quantity 
and weight, and estimated the projected value of the program under potential 
nationwide participation. To capture the health benefits attributable to the 
donated supplies at recipient institutions, we partnered with two tertiary-care 
centers in Guayaquil, Ecuador and conducted a pilot study on the utility of the 
donated supplies at the recipient institutions (October 2013). We determined the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted for all patients undergoing 
procedures involving donated items and estimated the annual attributable DALY as 
well as the cost per DALY averted both by supply and by procedure.
RESULTS: Approximately, 2 million lbs (907,185 kg) per year of medical supplies 
are recoverable from large non-rural US academic medical centers. Of these 
supplies, 19 common categories represent a potential for donation worth US $15 
million per year, at a cost-utility of US $2.14 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital operating rooms continue to represent a large source of 
recoverable surgical supplies that have demonstrable health benefits in the 
recipient communities. Cost-effective recovery and need-based donation programs 
can significantly alleviate the global burden of surgical diseases.

    Pediatr Nephrol. 2015 Feb;30(2):293-9.

The need for an early diagnosis of primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is 
particularly felt in children since they have a long life expectancy. However, 
IgAN has a slowly progressive course and renal function can even remain 
unchanged for decades. The long-term predictive value of modifiable risk 
factors, such as proteinuria and proliferative/inflammatory lesion at renal 
biopsy, remains unknown. Interest has focused on crescents, which represent a 
clear risk factor for renal vasculitides. A number of rare cases of 
extracapillary IgAN involving >40 % of glomeruli have been reported, but in most 
cases of IgAN crescents involve <10 % of glomeruli. The long-term effect of 
small non-circumferential crescents detected by chance or without a clinical 
picture of progressive IgAN is still unknown. The Oxford study failed to find a 
predictive value of crescents in either children or adults, and these results 
were confirmed by the recent VALIGA study on 1,147 patients with IgAN (174 
children). A recent study reports a correlation between the time elapsed from 
the diagnosis of urinary abnormalities and renal biopsy which suggests that 
crescents are associated with disease onset and then likely undergo a healing 
process into sclerotic lesions, which are commonly detected in biopsies 
performed years after onset. The authors of this study propose that primary IgAN 
may have similarities with Henoch-Schoenlein purpura nephritis, which presents 
with acute glomerular damage, mesangial proliferation, endocapillary leucocyte 
infiltration and crescent formations, and that these lesions can undergo 
resolution with sclerotic healing. This hypothesis is highly suggestive of the 
silent progression of several cases of IgAN without clear clinical changes, 
stressing once more the need for a combined clinical and pathological evaluation 
of children with IgAN that considers both the underlying pathogenetic event and 
its possible evolution.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stroke is common in patients undergoing long-term 
dialysis, but the implications for mortality after stroke in these patients are 
not fully understood.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A large cohort of dually-eligible 
(Medicare and Medicaid) patients initiating dialysis from 2000 to 2005 and 
surviving the first 90 days was constructed. Medicare claims were used to 
ascertain ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes occurring after 90-day survival. A 
semi-Markov model with additive hazard extension was generated to estimate the 
association between stroke and mortality, to calculate years of life lost after 
a stroke, and to determine whether race was associated with differential 
survival after stroke.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 69,371 individuals representing >112,000 
person-years of follow-up. Mean age±SD was 60.8±15.5 years. There were 21.1 (99% 
confidence interval [99% CI], 20.0 to 22.3) ischemic strokes and 4.7 (99% CI, 
4.2 to 5.3) hemorrhagic strokes after cohort entry per 1000 patient-years. At 30 
days, mortality was 17.9% for ischemic stroke and 53.4% for hemorrhagic stroke. 
The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) depended on time since entry into the cohort; 
for patients who experienced a stroke at 1 year after cohort entry, for example, 
the AHR of hemorrhagic stroke for mortality was 25.4 (99% CI, 22.4 to 28.4) at 1 
week, 9.9 (99% CI, 8.4 to 11.6) at 3 months, 5.9 (99% CI, 5.0 to 7.0) at 6 
months, and 1.8 (99% CI, 1.5 to 2.1) at 24 months. The corresponding AHRs for 
ischemic stroke were 11.7 (99% CI, 10.2 to 13.1) at 1 week, 6.6 (99% CI, 6.4 to 
6.7) at 3 months, and 4.7 (99% CI, 4.5 to 4.9) at 6 months, remaining 
significantly >1.0 even at 48 months. Median months of life lost were 40.7 for 
hemorrhagic stroke and 34.6 for ischemic stroke. For both stroke types, 
mortality did not differ by race.
CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis recipients have high mortality after a stroke with 
corresponding decrements in remaining years of life. Poststroke mortality does 
not differ by race.

Adherence to a healthy diet according to the World Health Organization 
guidelines and all-cause mortality in elderly adults from Europe and the United 
States.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has formulated guidelines for a healthy diet 
to prevent chronic diseases and postpone death worldwide. Our objective was to 
investigate the association between the WHO guidelines, measured using the 
Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), and all-cause mortality in elderly men and women 
from Europe and the United States. We analyzed data from 396,391 participants 
(42% women) in 11 prospective cohort studies who were 60 years of age or older 
at enrollment (in 1988-2005). HDI scores were based on 6 nutrients and 1 food 
group and ranged from 0 (least healthy diet) to 70 (healthiest diet). Adjusted 
cohort-specific hazard ratios were derived by using Cox proportional hazards 
regression and subsequently pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. During 
4,497,957 person-years of follow-up, 84,978 deaths occurred. Median HDI scores 
ranged from 40 to 54 points across cohorts. For a 10-point increase in HDI score 
(representing adherence to an additional WHO guideline), the pooled adjusted 
hazard ratios were 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87, 0.93) for men and 
women combined, 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.92) for men, and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.95) 
for women. These estimates translate to an increased life expectancy of 2 years 
at the age of 60 years. Greater adherence to the WHO guidelines is associated 
with greater longevity in elderly men and women in Europe and the United States.

Becoming overweight: is there a health risk?

Ginter E, Simko V.

Overweight and obesity is becoming widespread enough to generate an acceptable 
and misleading social status. By 2030, in the USA up to 86 % of adults will be 
overweight or obese. Some selected statistical data based on the body mass index 
(BMI) indicated that overweight was not associated with increased mortality, 
this provoked a conceivable interest. Added to this is the observation that 
while the prevalence of obesity is dramatically increasing, the cardiovascular 
mortality and life expectancy in the European Union and USA has improved. When 
more sensitive indicators of body adiposity and its distribution than the BMI, 
like the waist-thigh ratio in both sexes and the waist-hip ratio in women are 
projected on mortality, it becomes obvious that even overweight is associated 
with an increased health risk. Gaining excessive body fat is a continuous, 
frequently progressive process. Present obesity epidemic in childhood will 
manifest with deleterious consequences only in future years when adolescents 
reach adulthood. Prevention is thus essential even before the overweight sets 
in. Improved life expectancy observed in large populations despite obesity 
epidemic, is a favourable medical success in the management of hypertension, of 
serum lipid disorders and diabetes. While encouraging, when it is observed in 
large population, it does not take away the potential health risk of a metabolic 
disorder in an individual who is overweight (Fig. 7, Ref. 25).

Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for 
stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Medical School, One Brigham Circle, 1620 Tremont Street, 4-020, Boston, MA,

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran and 
rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with 
atrial fibrillation (AF) in Singapore.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of dabigatran 110 and 150 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg and adjusted-dose 
warfarin from the perspective of the Singapore healthcare system, using clinical 
data from published studies, utilities from a patient-reported survey and costs 
from hospital databases. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 
65-year-old AF patients with no contraindications to anticoagulation.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the QALYs were 8.75 with warfarin, 8.73 with 
dabigatran 110 mg, 8.82 with dabigatran 150 mg, and 9.33 with rivaroxaban. The 
costs were Singapore dollar (SG$) 34,648 for warfarin, SG$54,919 for dabigatran 
110 mg, SG$50,484 for dabigatran 150 mg and SG$51,975 for rivaroxaban. The ICER 
of rivaroxaban versus warfarin was SG$29,697 (US$26,727) per QALY. Rivaroxaban 
and warfarin had extended dominance over the high-dose dabigatran. The low-dose 
dabigatran was dominated by warfarin. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed 
that the ICER of rivaroxaban versus warfarin was sensitive to cost of 
rivaroxaban and utilities for rivaroxaban and warfarin. Probability sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that the probability of rivaroxaban being the optimal 
choice was 97.8% and 99.5% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SG$65,000 
(US$58,500) and SG$130,000 (US$117,000) per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban may be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin for the 
prevention of stroke in patients with AF in Singapore.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision analytic model to calculate outcomes after 
treatment of cerebral aneurysms in elderly patients. Neurosurgical clipping and 
endovascular coiling for both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms were compared 
with predicted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after treatment.
METHODS: A Medline search of articles published in English between 1995 and June 
2012 was performed using key words: 'intracranial aneurysms', 'treatment', or 
various combinations of 'elderly', 'older', or 'decade'. Reports that met 
inclusion criteria used either the Glasgow Outcome Score or the modified Rankin 
Scale for outcomes, age >69, and intracranial aneurysm that was treated by 
endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Data were collected by performing a 
comprehensive review of published reports. Meta-analysis (inverse 
variance-weighted, random effects) was used to calculate pooled values for 
probabilities and HRQoL.
RESULTS: HRQoL was significantly higher for patients with coiled rather than 
clipped aneurysms in both ruptured (p<0.01) and unruptured (p<0.01) aneurysm 
groups. Periprocedural mortality rates were significantly lower among patients 
with a coiled, unruptured aneurysm than among patients with a clipped, 
unruptured aneurysm (p=0.032). Sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation 
for both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms showed that overall HRQoL was 
significantly higher in coiled than in clipped patients.
CONCLUSIONS: As life expectancy increases, treatment of cerebral aneurysms in 
the elderly becomes more important. Given the results of this decision analysis 
and the continuous refinement in endovascular technology, embolization should 
strongly be considered as a first-line treatment for cerebral aneurysms in the 
elderly.

Increases in smoking cessation interventions after a feedback and improvement 
initiative using electronic health records -- 19 community health centers, New 
York City, October 2010-March 2012.

Silfen SL, Farley SM, Shih SC, Duquaine DC, Ricci JM, Kansagra SM, Edwards SM, 
Babb S, McAfee T; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Quitting smoking substantially reduces smokers' risk for smoking-related 
morbidity and mortality and can increase life expectancy by up to a decade. Most 
smokers want to quit and make at least one medical provider visit annually. 
Health care providers can play an important role in helping smokers quit by 
documenting patients' tobacco use, advising smokers to quit, and providing 
evidence-based cessation treatments or referrals for treatment, but many 
providers and practices do not regularly take these actions. Systems to increase 
provider screening and delivery of cessation interventions are available; in 
particular, electronic health records (EHRs) can be powerful tools to facilitate 
increased cessation interventions. This analysis reports on an EHR-based 
pay-for-improvement initiative in 19 community health centers (CHCs) in New York 
City (NYC) that sought to increase smoking status documentation and cessation 
interventions. At the end of the initiative, the mean proportion of patients who 
were documented as smokers in CHCs had increased from 24% to 27%, whereas the 
mean proportion of documented smokers who received a cessation intervention had 
increased from 23% to 54%. Public health programs and health systems should 
consider implementing strategies to equip and train clinical providers to use 
information technology to increase delivery of cessation interventions.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to determine the protective effects 
of human insulin and its analogues, B28Asp human insulin (insulin aspart) and 
B29Lys(ε-tetradecanoyl),desB30 human insulin (insulin detemir), against 
glucose-induced lifespan reduction and neuronal damage in the model organism 
Caenorhabditis elegans and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Nematodes were cultivated under high glucose (HG) conditions comparable 
with the situation in diabetic patients and treated with human insulin and its 
analogues. Lifespan was assessed and neuronal damage was evaluated with regard 
to structural and functional impairment. Additionally, the activity of 
glyoxalase-1 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and AGEs were determined.
RESULTS: Insulin and its analogues reversed the life-shortening effect of HG 
conditions and prevented the glucose-induced neuronal impairment. Insulin 
treatment under HG conditions was associated with reduced concentration of 
glucose, as well as a reduced formation of ROS and AGEs, and increased SOD 
activity. These effects were dependent on the Forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue 
abnormal dauer formation (DAF)-16. Furthermore, glyoxalase-1 activity, which was 
impaired under HG conditions, was restored by human insulin. This was essential 
for the insulin-induced lifespan extension under HG conditions, as no change in 
lifespan was observed following either suppression or overexpression of 
glyoxalase-1.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Human insulin and its analogues prevent the 
reduction in lifespan and neuronal damage caused by HG conditions. The effect of 
human insulin is mediated by a daf-2/insulin receptor and daf-16/FOXO-dependent 
pathway and is mediated by upregulation of detoxifying mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: In the UK and other high-income countries, life expectancy in people 
with schizophrenia is 20% lower than in the general population.
AIMS: To examine the quality of assessment and treatment of physical health 
problems in people with schizophrenia. Method Retrospective audit of records of 
people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder aged ⩾18. We collected 
data on nine key aspects of physical health for 5091 patients and combined these 
with a cross-sectional patient survey.
RESULTS: Body mass index was recorded in 2599 (51.1%) patients during the 
previous 12 months and 1102 (21.6%) had evidence of assessment of all nine key 
measures. Among those with high blood sugar, there was recorded evidence of 
53.5% receiving an appropriate intervention. Among those with dyslipidaemia, 
this was 19.9%. Despite this, most patients reported that they were satisfied 
with the physical healthcare they received.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment and treatment of common physical health problems in 
people with schizophrenia falls well below acceptable standards. Cooperation and 
communication between primary and secondary care services needs to improve if 
premature mortality in this group is to be reduced.

This review summarizes studies on the natural history of dementia with a focus 
on Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Understanding the course of 
dementia is important not only for patients, caregivers, and health 
professionals, but also for health policy-makers, who have to plan for national 
resources needed in the management of an increasing number of dementia cases. 
From the available published data, the life expectancy of elderly people with 
dementia is shorter than that of non-demented elderly. Reports on survival after 
a diagnosis of dementia vary from 3 to 12 years. The wide variation is partly 
due to the diagnostic criteria used in the studies and the sites where they were 
conducted (i.e. hospitals, clinics, or homes). There is an apparent difference 
in survival between Alzheimer's disease patients with onset of illness before 75 
years and those after 75 years: the younger patients have a longer life 
expectancy. However, there are conflicting data on survival (in years) comparing 
male and female patients and comparing patients of different ethnicities. For 
vascular dementia, published papers on life expectancy vary between 3 to 5 
years. Vascular dementia appears to have a poorer prognosis than Alzheimer's 
disease. The stages of severity of dementia were compared in a follow-up of a 
sample of Alzheimer's disease patients in Singapore, and the mean duration of 
the mild phase (clinical dementia rating 1) was 5.6 years, the moderate phase 
(clinical dementia rating 2) was 3.5 years, and the severe phase (clinical 
dementia rating 3) was 3.2 years. At the various phases of the disease, the 
demand on health-care services and economic cost are different.

OBJECTIVES: A policy model is a model that can evaluate the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of interventions and inform policy decisions. In this study, 
we introduce a cardiovascular disease (CVD) policy model which can be used to 
model remaining life expectancy including a measure of socioeconomic deprivation 
as an independent risk factor for CVD.
DESIGN: A state transition model was developed using the Scottish Heart Health 
Extended Cohort (SHHEC) linked to Scottish morbidity and death records. 
Individuals start in a CVD-free state and can transit to three CVD event states 
plus a non-CVD death state. Individuals who have a non-fatal first event are 
then followed up until death. Taking a competing risk approach, the 
cause-specific hazards of a first event are modelled using parametric survival 
analysis. Survival following a first non-fatal event is also modelled 
parametrically. We assessed discrimination, validation and calibration of our 
model.
RESULTS: Our model achieved a good level of discrimination in each component 
(c-statistics for men (women)-non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD): 0.70 
(0.74), non-fatal cerebrovascular disease (CBVD): 0.73 (0.76), fatal CVD: 0.77 
(0.80), fatal non-CVD: 0.74 (0.72), survival after non-fatal CHD: 0.68 (0.67) 
and survival after non-fatal CBVD: 0.65 (0.66)). In general, our model 
predictions were comparable with observed event rates for a Scottish randomised 
statin trial population which has an overlapping follow-up period with SHHEC. 
After applying a calibration factor, our predictions of life expectancy closely 
match those published in recent national life tables.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model can be used to estimate the impact of primary prevention 
interventions on life expectancy and can assess the impact of interventions on 
inequalities.

Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is one of the key mechanisms of DNA 
rearrangement. NAHR occurring between direct homologous repeats can generate 
genomic copy number variation (CNV) and make significant contributions to both 
genome evolution and human diseases such as cancer. Intriguingly, previous 
observations on the rare CNVs at certain genomic disorder loci suggested that 
NAHR frequency could be dependent on homology properties. However, such a 
correlation remains unclear at the other NAHR-mediated CNV loci, especially the 
common CNVs in human populations. Different from the rare CNVs associated with 
genomic disorders, it is challenging to identify de novo NAHR events at common 
CNV loci. Therefore, our previously proposed statistic M was employed in 
estimating relative mutation rate for the NAHR-mediated CNVs in human 
populations. By utilizing generalized regression neural network and principal 
component analysis in studying 4330 CNVs ascertained in 3 HapMap populations, we 
identified the CNVs mediated by NAHR between paired segmental duplications (SDs) 
and further revealed the correlations between SD properties and NAHR 
probability. SD length and inter-SD distance were shown to make major 
contributions to the occurrence of NAHR, whereas chromosomal position and 
sequence similarity of paired SDs are also involved in NAHR. An integrated 
effect of SD properties on NAHR frequency was revealed for the common CNVs in 
human populations. These observations can be well explained by ectopic synapsis 
in NAHR together with our proposed model of chromosomal 
compression/extension/looping (CCEL) for homology mis-pairing. Our findings 
showed the important roles of SDs in NAHR and human genomic evolution.

The United Nations regularly publishes projections of the populations of all the 
world's countries broken down by age and sex. These projections are the de facto 
standard and are widely used by international organizations, governments and 
researchers. Like almost all other population projections, they are produced 
using the standard deterministic cohort-component projection method and do not 
yield statements of uncertainty. We describe a Bayesian method for producing 
probabilistic population projections for most countries that the United Nations 
could use. It has at its core Bayesian hierarchical models for the total 
fertility rate and life expectancy at birth. We illustrate the method and show 
how it can be extended to address concerns about the UN's current assumptions 
about the long-term distribution of fertility. The method is implemented in the 
R packages bayesTFR, bayesLife, bayesPop and bayesDem.

Endoscopic palliative biliary drainage is considered as a gold standard 
treatment in advanced or inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Also, metal stents 
are preferred over plastic stents in patients with >3 months life expectancy. 
However, the endoscopic intervention of advanced hilar obstruction is often more 
challenging and complex than that of distal malignant biliary obstructions. In 
this literature review, we describe the issues commonly encountered during 
endoscopic unilateral (single) versus bilateral (multiple) biliary stenting for 
malignant hilar obstruction. Also, we provide technical guidance to improve the 
technical success rates and patient outcomes, focusing on bilateral metallic 
stenting techniques such as stent-in-stent or side-by-side deployment.

trials translate into clinical practice--a case-based evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Clinical experience of patients is an additional source of 
information that can inform prescribing decisions for new therapies in practice. 
In diabetes, for example, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia may be excluded 
from trials conducted for regulatory purposes. Using insulin degludec (IDeg), a 
new basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action as an example, an 
interim analysis is presented describing whether the decision to prescribe IDeg 
to patients experiencing treatment-limiting problems on their existing insulin 
regimes represented good clinical and economic value.
METHODS: Records from the first 51 consecutive patients with diabetes (35 type 1 
[T1D] and 16 type 2 [T2D]) switching to insulin degludec from either insulin 
glargine (IGlar) or insulin detemir (IDet), mostly due to problems with 
hypoglycemia (39/51, 76.5%), were reviewed at up to 37 weeks. Patients indicated 
frequency of hypoglycemia and completed a disease-specific questionnaire 
reporting six measures of confidence and treatment satisfaction. For the largest 
group of exposed patents, the T1D module of the IMS Core Diabetes Model (CDM) 
was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment decision.
FINDINGS: HbA1c decreased by 0.5 ± 0.3% points and 0.7 ± 0.3% points for T1D and 
T2D, respectively. Hypoglycemic events decreased by >90%. Combined mean scores 
were ≥ 3.7 (1 = much worse, 3 = no change, 5 = much improved) for all six 
satisfaction and confidence items. In T1D, the treatment decision was highly 
cost-effective in the CDM lifetime analysis. Even when excluding benefits beyond 
hypoglycemia reduction, predicted cost per quality-adjusted life-year for IDeg 
vs IGlar/IDet was £10,754.
INTERPRETATION: These data illustrate the complementary nature of clinical trial 
and practice data when evaluating the value of therapeutic innovations in 
diabetes care. There were reductions in patient-reported hypoglycemia, reduced 
HbA1c, and improved treatment satisfaction in relation to the decision to 
prescribe IDeg. Initial health economic evaluation suggested that the decision 
to prescribe IDeg in this phenotypic group of T1D patients represented good 
value for money.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To estimate the health utility score and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) index of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in patients 
over 1 y of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.
DESIGN: Longitudinal interventional study.
SETTING: The study was carried out in Sao Paulo Sleep Institute, Brazil.
PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five patients with OSAS and with 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 20 of either sex, body mass index < 40 kg/m(2), and 
no previous contact with CPAP were included.
INTERVENTIONS: The participants underwent baseline and titration 
polysomnographies, clinical evaluation, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) 
measurement, completed Short-Form 6 Dimension Health Survey (SF-6D) and Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires, and implementation of CPAP. The patients 
were followed for 1 y.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean AHI and age were 57.6 ± 29.2 events/h and 
53.3 ± 9.3 y, respectively. One year of CPAP treatment increased the health 
utility score from 0.611 ± 0.112 to 0.710 ± 0.121 (P < 0.01). Therefore, CPAP 
resulted in a mean gain of 0.092 QALY/patient. The improvements in utility 
scores were associated with decreases in the ESS after 1 mo, in systolic BP 
after 1 y, and in diastolic BP at 6 mo. BP normalization group (≤ 130/85 mmHg) 
showed higher QALY than that of the non-normalization group (0.10 ± 0.09 versus 
0.05 ± 0.10; P = 0.03). One-year ESS score (P = 0.03), diastolic BP reduction P 
= 0.01) and baseline utility scores (P < 0.01) were significantly associated 
with QALY gain.
CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant QALY/patient gain after 1 y of 
regular CPAP use. In addition, BP normalization was associated with higher QALY 
gain. Thus, utility studies can provide more complete analyses of the total 
benefits of CPAP treatment in patients with OSAS and should be encouraged.

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to investigate the cost effectiveness of 
apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran compared with coumarin derivatives for 
stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in a country with 
specialized anticoagulation clinics (the Netherlands) and in a country without 
these clinics (the UK).
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was used to analyse the cost 
effectiveness of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran compared with coumarin 
derivatives in the Netherlands and the UK over a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: In the Netherlands, the use of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or dabigatran 
increased health by 0.166, 0.365, and 0.374 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
compared with coumarin derivatives, but also increased costs by <euro>5,681, 
<euro>4,754, and <euro>5,465, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) were <euro>34,248, <euro>13,024, and <euro>14,626 per QALY 
gained. In the UK, health was increased by 0.302, 0.455, and 0.461 QALYs, and 
the incremental costs were similar for all three new oral anticoagulants 
(<euro>5,118-5,217). The ICERs varied from <euro>11,172 to 16,949 per QALY 
gained. In the Netherlands, apixaban had the highest chance (37 %) of being cost 
effective at a threshold of <euro>20,000; in the UK, this chance was 41 % for 
dabigatran. The quality of care, reflected in time in therapeutic range, had an 
important influence on the ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are cost-effective 
alternatives to coumarin derivatives in the UK, while in the Netherlands, only 
apixaban and dabigatran could be considered cost effective. The cost 
effectiveness of the new oral anticoagulants is largely dependent on the setting 
and quality of local anticoagulant care facilities.

BACKGROUND: The obective of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness 
analysis comparing intermittent with continuous renal replacement therapy (IRRT 
versus CRRT) as initial therapy for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive 
care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Assuming some patients would potentially be eligible for either 
modality, we modeled life year gained, the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and healthcare costs for a cohort of 1000 IRRT patients and a cohort of 1000 
CRRT patients. We used a 1-year, 5-year and a lifetime horizon. A Markov model 
with two health states for AKI survivors was designed: dialysis dependence and 
dialysis independence. We applied Weibull regression from published estimates to 
fit survival curves for CRRT and IRRT patients and to fit the proportion of 
dialysis dependence among CRRT and IRRT survivors. We then applied a risk ratio 
reported in a large retrospective cohort study to the fitted CRRT estimates in 
order to determine the proportion of dialysis dependence for IRRT survivors. We 
conducted sensitivity analyses based on a range of differences for daily 
implementation cost between CRRT and IRRT (base case: CRRT day $632 more 
expensive than IRRT day; range from $200 to $1000) and a range of risk ratios 
for dialysis dependence for CRRT as compared with IRRT (from 0.65 to 0.95; base 
case: 0.80).
RESULTS: Continuous renal replacement therapy was associated with a marginally 
greater gain in QALY as compared with IRRT (1.093 versus 1.078). Despite higher 
upfront costs for CRRT in the ICU ($4046 for CRRT versus $1423 for IRRT in 
average), the 5-year total cost including the cost of dialysis dependence was 
lower for CRRT ($37 780 for CRRT versus $39 448 for IRRT on average). The base 
case incremental cost-effectiveness analysis showed that CRRT dominated IRRT. 
This dominance was confirmed by extensive sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial CRRT is cost-effective compared with initial IRRT by 
reducing the rate of long-term dialysis dependence among critically ill AKI 
survivors.

[debridement algorithm].

[Article in Croatian]

Marinović M, Fumić N, Laginja S, Aldo I.

Prolonged life expectancy increases the proportion of elderly population. The 
incidence of injury increases with older age. A variety of comorbidities 
(circulation disorders, diabetes mellitus, metabolic imbalances, etc.) and 
reduced biological tissue regeneration potential that accompanies older age, 
lead to a higher prevalence of chronic wounds. This poses a significant health, 
social and economic burden upon the society. Injuries in the elderly demand 
significant involvement of medical and non-medical staff in the prehospital and 
hospital treatment of the injured, with high material consumption and reduced 
quality of life in these patients, their families and caregivers. Debridement is 
a crucial medical procedure in the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. The 
aim of debridement is removal of all residues in wound bed and environment. 
Debridement can be conducted several times when there is proper indication. 
There are several ways of debridement procedure, each having advantages and 
disadvantages. The method of debridement is chosen by the physician or other 
medical professional. It is based on wound characteristics and the physician's 
expertise and capabilities. In the same type of wound, various types of 
debridement can be combined, all with the aim of faster and better wound 
healing.

On remembering: the notion of memory without recollection.

Botella C(1).

Author information:
(1)11, rue Jean de Beauvais, 75005 Paris, France. cbotella@club-internet.fr.

The author begins by attempting to evaluate the notions of memory and 
remembering, taking into account their evolution in Freud's work and the current 
debates on their relative importance in conducting an analytic treatment. This 
leads the author to develop an extension of the theory which none the less 
remains Freudian, by introducing a series of notions (the main ones being the 
work of figurability, regredience, state of session, negative of trauma, and 
memory without recollection), and arguing in favour of a principle of 
convergence-coherence governing mental life. His thesis is the following: 
analytic practice contains a dimension of an archaeological order, as Freud 
described it, as well as - thanks to the contribution of contemporary practice 
denouncing its insufficiency - the complementary need for the analyst to work in 
a particular way in the session - that is to say, one that involves what he 
calls a regredience of his or her thought processes, allowing him or her to gain 
access to early psychic zones beyond the zone of represented memories. This is 
what he calls transformational psychoanalysis, complementary to archeological 
psychoanalysis. The author's theoretical and practical developments are backed 
up by a personal schema of mental functioning, an extension of Freud's schema in 
1900, and the detailed description of an analytic treatment, in particular, the 
central session which played a crucial role in the success of this analysis.
