Alongside an increase in life expectancy, median age of patients presenting with 
traumatic acute subdural hematomas (ASDH) has increased as well. Treatment 
guidelines are based on studies performed on relatively young patients. The 
optimal management of elderly (>70 years old) patients with ASDH, specifically 
those with relatively preserved level of consciousness, was not thoroughly 
investigated so far. We retrospectively examined elderly patients presented to 
our medical center between the years 2006-2016 with traumatic convexity ASDH and 
GCS of 13-15. 773 patients were included in the initial cohort and 54 patients 
were included in the final analysis. The mean age at presentation was 81.5 years 
and the means of hematoma thickness and midline shift were 15.5 mm and 6.6 mm, 
respectively. Patients in our cohort had an overall unfavorable outcome (mRS 
5-6) of 28% and 56% at discharge and at 1 year following injury, respectively. 
The results were not significantly different for the subgroups of patients older 
than 80 years and patients with high ASA-PS. Surgical evacuation of the ASDH was 
undertaken in 28 patients with focal neurologic deficit and/or worsening on 
subsequent brain scans. At 1 year, 64% (18 patients) in the surgery group had 
unfavorable outcome compared to 48% (12 patients) in the conservative group. We 
believe that these numbers should be taken under consideration when assessing 
elderly patients with convexity ASDH and relatively preserved level of 
consciousness.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder and the 
leading genetic cause of infantile mortality. While several functions have been 
ascribed to the SMN (survival motor neuron) protein, their specific contribution 
to the disease has yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesized that some, but 
not all, SMN homologues would rescue the SMA phenotype in mouse models, thereby 
identifying disease-relevant domains. Using AAV9 to deliver Smn homologs to SMA 
mice, we identified a conservation threshold that marks the boundary at which 
homologs can rescue the SMA phenotype. Smn from Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis 
significantly prevent disease, whereas Smn from Drosophila melanogaster, 
Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe was significantly less 
efficacious. This phenotypic rescue correlated with correction of RNA processing 
defects induced by SMN deficiency and neuromuscular junction pathology. Based 
upon the sequence conservation in the rescuing homologs, a minimal SMN construct 
was designed consisting of exons 2, 3, and 6, which showed a partial rescue of 
the SMA phenotype. While a significant extension in survival was observed, the 
absence of a complete rescue suggests that while the core conserved region is 
essential, additional sequences contribute to the overall ability of the SMN 
protein to rescue disease pathology.

The role of microRNAs in congenital heart disease.

Debrecen, Hungary.

Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the leading inherited cause of perinatal 
and infant mortality. CHD refers to structural anomalies of the heart and blood 
vessels that arise during cardiac development and represents a broad spectrum of 
malformations, including septal and valve defects, lesions affecting the outflow 
tract and ventricules. Advanced treatment strategies have greatly improved life 
expectancy and led to expanded population of adult patients with CHD. Thus, a 
better understanding of the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms underlying 
CHDs is essential to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients. The 
etiology of CHD is largely unknown, genetic and environmental factors may 
contribute to the disease. In addition to the mutations affecting genomic DNA, 
epigenetic changes are being increasingly acknowledged as key factors in the 
development and progression of CHDs. The posttranscriptional regulation of gene 
expression by microRNAs (miRs) controls the highly complex multi-cell lineage 
process of cardiac tissue formation. In recent years, multiplex experimental 
models have provided evidence that changes in expression levels of miRs are 
associated with human cardiovascular disease, including CHD. The newly described 
correlations between miRs and heart development suggest the potential importance 
of miRs as diagnostic markers in human cardiovascular diseases. In the future, 
more intensive research is likely to be carried out to clarify their 
contribution to personalized management and treatment of CHD patients. In this 
paper, we discuss the current knowledge on the causative role of miRs in cardiac 
development and CHDs.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1): An Update and the Significance of 
Early Genetic and Clinical Diagnosis.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome 
inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and characterized by a predisposition 
to a multitude of endocrine neoplasms primarily of parathyroid, 
enteropancreatic, and anterior pituitary origin, as well as nonendocrine 
neoplasms. Other endocrine tumors in MEN1 include foregut carcinoid tumors, 
adrenocortical tumors, and rarely pheochromocytoma. Nonendocrine manifestations 
include meningiomas and ependymomas, lipomas, angiofibromas, collagenomas, and 
leiomyomas. MEN1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor 
gene MEN1 which encodes the protein menin. This syndrome can affect all age 
groups, with 17% of patients developing MEN1-associated tumors before 21 years 
of age. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of MEN1-associated 
tumors, patients with MEN1 continue to have decreased life expectancy primarily 
due to malignant neuroendocrine tumors. The most recent clinical practice 
guidelines for MEN1, published in 2012, highlight the need for early genetic and 
clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and recommend an intensive surveillance approach for 
both patients with this syndrome and asymptomatic carriers starting at the age 
of 5 years with the goal of timely detection and management of MEN1-associated 
neoplasms and ultimately decreased disease-specific morbidity and mortality. 
Unfortunately, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation and individual 
mutation-dependent surveillance is not possible currently.

Around 80% of women experience vaginal tears during labour when the diameter of 
the vagina must increase to allow the passage of a full-term baby. Current 
techniques for evaluating vaginal tears are qualitative and often lead to an 
incorrect diagnosis and inadequate treatment, severely compromising the quality 
of life of women. In order to characterize the failure properties of the vaginal 
tissue, whole vaginal tracts from rats (n = 18) were subjected to free-extension 
inflation tests until rupture using a custom-built experimental set-up. The 
resulting deformations were measured using the digital image correlation 
technique. Overall, the strain and changes in curvature in the hoop direction 
were significantly larger relative to the axial direction. At a failure pressure 
of 110 ± 23 kPa (mean ± s.d.), the hoop and axial stresses were computed to be 
970 ± 340 kPa and 490 ± 170 kPa, respectively. Moreover, at such pressure, the 
hoop and axial strains were found to be 12.8 ± 4.4% and 6.4 ± 3.7% , 
respectively. Rupture of the vaginal specimens always occurred in the hoop 
direction by tearing along the axial direction. This knowledge about the rupture 
properties of the vaginal tissue will be crucial for the development of clinical 
approaches for preventing and mitigating vaginal tearing and the associated 
short- and long-term traumatic conditions.

PURPOSE: We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use to 
prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree model was used to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing catheter-associated 
urinary tract infections for patients with a short-term indwelling urinary 
catheter. The model accounted for incidence of urinary tract infections with and 
without the use of prophylactic antibiotics, incidence of antibiotic-resistant 
urinary tract infections, as well as costs associated with diagnosis and 
treatment of urinary tract infections and antibiotic-resistant urinary tract 
infections. Costs were calculated from the health care system's perspective. We 
conducted one-way sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that the use of prophylactic antibiotics 
is cost-saving in preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The 
use of prophylactic antibiotics resulted in lower costs and higher 
quality-adjusted life-years compared with no prophylactic antibiotics. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal strategy changes to no prophylactic 
antibiotics when the incidence of urinary tract infections after prophylactic 
antibiotics exceeds 22% or the incidence of developing urinary tract infections 
without prophylactic antibiotics is less than 12%. Varying the costs of 
prophylactic antibiotics, urinary tract infection treatment, or 
antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infection treatment within a reasonable range 
did not change the optimal strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary 
tract infections is cost-effective under most conditions. These results were 
sensitive to the likelihood of developing catheter-associated urinary tract 
infections with and without prophylactic antibiotics. Our results are limited to 
the cost-effectiveness perspective on this clinical practice.

Both the demographic shift and progress in medicine are resulting in an 
increasingly longer life expectancy. It is presumed that a mean age of 90 years 
will be achieved within the next decade in many countries. Thus, geriatric 
medicine, which is committed to the specific needs of older, often frail and 
frequently comorbid patients, is becoming increasingly more important. The 
prevalence of infections of the genitourinary tract increases with age, 
simultaneously, a critical and conscious use of antibiotics is required in terms 
of antimicrobial treatment. The intention of the present review is to make the 
reader aware of the specific characteristics of urinary tract infections and 
asymptomatic bacteriuria in the older patient population in terms of 
epidemiology, spectrum of pathogens and resistance as well as the indications 
for and performance of antimicrobial treatment.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis is highly prevalent in black/African American, 
Asian, and Hispanic patients, making assessment of these populations in clinical 
trials important. Crisaborole ointment, 2%, is a nonsteroidal phosphodiesterase 
4 inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. In two 
pivotal phase III clinical trials in patients aged ≥ 2 years, crisaborole was 
superior to vehicle in reducing global disease severity. The most common 
treatment-related adverse event was application site pain.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of crisaborole according to patient race and ethnicity.
METHODS: A pooled post hoc analysis by race and ethnicity of the two pivotal 
trials and a safety extension trial was performed. Race included white or 
nonwhite (encompassing Asian/native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, 
black/African American, and other/American Indian/Alaskan native); ethnicity 
included Hispanic/Latino or not Hispanic/Latino.
RESULTS: In white, nonwhite, Hispanic/Latino, and not Hispanic/Latino groups at 
day 29, more crisaborole- than vehicle-treated patients achieved improvements in 
global disease severity [Investigator's Static Global Assessment of clear/almost 
clear with a ≥ 2-grade improvement (white: 33.5% vs. 22.3%, nominal p < 0.001; 
nonwhite: 30.0% vs. 21.3%, nominal p < 0.05; Hispanic/Latino: 35.4% vs. 18.2%, 
nominal p < 0.01; not Hispanic/Latino: 31.3% vs. 22.8%, nominal p < 0.01)]. 
Crisaborole treatment also improved atopic dermatitis signs/symptoms and quality 
of life. Frequency of crisaborole-related adverse events was 7.1-8.5% in the 
pivotal trials.
CONCLUSION: Across races and ethnicities, crisaborole demonstrated efficacy for 
the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, with a low frequency of 
treatment-related adverse events.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec (degludec) 
versus insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) in basal-bolus regimens for 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular (CV) risk based on 
the DEVOTE CV outcomes trial.
METHODS: A microsimulation model, informed by clinical outcomes from the 
subgroup of patients using basal-bolus insulin therapy in DEVOTE (NCT01959529) 
and by the UKPDS Outcomes Model 2 risk equations, was used to model direct costs 
(2018 GBP) and effectiveness outcomes [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] with 
degludec versus glargine U100 over a 40-year time horizon. The model captured 
the development of eight diabetes-related complications, death, severe 
hypoglycemia and insulin dosing. This analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of National Health Service (NHS) England.
RESULTS: Treatment with degludec versus glargine U100 in basal-bolus regimens 
was associated with improved clinical outcomes at a higher cost per patient 
[incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER): £14,956 GBP/QALY]. Degludec 
remained cost effective versus glargine U100 in all exploratory sensitivity 
analyses, with ICERs below the widely accepted willingness-to-pay threshold, 
although the result was most sensitive to assumptions regarding the persistence 
of treatment effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term modeling analysis suggested that degludec was cost 
effective (from the perspective of NHS England) versus glargine U100 in 
basal-bolus regimens for patients with T2D at high CV risk. Our findings raise 
important questions regarding how to model the health economics of diabetes 
therapies.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) have a higher 
prevalence of autoimmune gastritis (AIG) compared with the general population. 
The association between ATD and AIG is poorly characterized in the pediatric 
age. We reviewed the prevalence of anti-gastric parietal cell antibodies (PCA) 
in young patients with ATD to evaluate its usefulness as a marker for AIG 
screening.
METHODS: We evaluated 220 children and adolescents (11.28 ± 6.37 years) with ATD 
(186 with autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) and 34 with Graves' disease (GD). At ATD 
diagnosis and annually thereafter, blood counts and PCA levels were measured. In 
patients positive for PCA, plasma gastrin, chromogranin A, vitamin B12, iron and 
ferritin levels and H. pylori antigen were measured. PCA-positive patients 
> 18 years were invited to undergo a gastroscopic exam.
RESULTS: PCA positivity was detected in ten (4.5%) subjects (5F/5M; 
12.6 ± 3.4 years). The prevalence of PCA positivity was not significantly 
different in the comparison of GD and AT patients (p = 0.9). PCA positivity was 
detected after 2.7 ± 2.7 years of follow-up in AT and 4.4 ± 4.0 years in GD 
(p = 0.4). Autoantibody positivity was more prevalent in female patients, in 
both AT and GD (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). At detection of PCA 
positivity, five out of ten PCA-positive patients had iron deficiency, four 
vitamin B12 deficiency, two anemia, three hypergastrinemia and two elevated 
chromogranin values. Two patients had H. pylori infection. Gastroscopy was 
performed in the five ATD patients and in all patients, AIG was confirmed.
CONCLUSION: In the juvenile population, ATD and AIG may also be associated. PCA 
screening is useful to detect subjects at risk for this condition. Due to the 
longer life expectancy of the pediatric population and considering the 
relatively high risk of malignant transformation, early surveillance monitoring 
is mandatory for children and adolescents with ATD.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer and its treatment can have an impact on health-related 
quality of life and survival. Tumour profiling tests aim to identify whether or 
not women need chemotherapy owing to their risk of relapse.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the tumour profiling tests oncotype DX® (Genomic Health, 
Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA), MammaPrint® (Agendia, Inc., Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands), Prosigna® (NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA), 
EndoPredict® (Myriad Genetics Ltd, London, UK) and immunohistochemistry 4 
(IHC4). To develop a health economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
these tests compared with clinical tools to guide the use of adjuvant 
chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer from the perspective of the NHS and 
Personal Social Services.
DESIGN: A systematic review and health economic analysis were conducted.
REVIEW METHODS: The systematic review was partially an update of a 2013 review. 
Nine databases were searched in February 2017. The review included studies 
assessing clinical effectiveness in people with oestrogen receptor-positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, stage I or II cancer with 
zero to three positive lymph nodes. The economic analysis included a review of 
existing analyses and the development of a de novo model.
RESULTS: A total of 153 studies were identified. Only one completed randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) using a tumour profiling test in clinical practice was 
identified: Microarray In Node-negative Disease may Avoid ChemoTherapy (MINDACT) 
for MammaPrint. Other studies suggest that all the tests can provide information 
on the risk of relapse; however, results were more varied in lymph node-positive 
(LN+) patients than in lymph node-negative (LN0) patients. There is limited and 
varying evidence that oncotype DX and MammaPrint can predict benefit from 
chemotherapy. The net change in the percentage of patients with a chemotherapy 
recommendation or decision pre/post test ranged from an increase of 1% to a 
decrease of 23% among UK studies and a decrease of 0% to 64% across European 
studies. The health economic analysis suggests that the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for the tests versus current practice are broadly 
favourable for the following scenarios: (1) oncotype DX, for the LN0 subgroup 
with a Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) of > 3.4 and the one to three positive 
lymph nodes (LN1-3) subgroup (if a predictive benefit is assumed); (2) IHC4 plus 
clinical factors (IHC4+C), for all patient subgroups; (3) Prosigna, for the LN0 
subgroup with a NPI of > 3.4 and the LN1-3 subgroup; (4) EndoPredict Clinical, 
for the LN1-3 subgroup only; and (5) MammaPrint, for no subgroups.
LIMITATIONS: There was only one completed RCT using a tumour profiling test in 
clinical practice. Except for oncotype DX in the LN0 group with a NPI score of 
> 3.4 (clinical intermediate risk), evidence surrounding pre- and post-test 
chemotherapy probabilities is subject to considerable uncertainty. There is 
uncertainty regarding whether or not oncotype DX and MammaPrint are predictive 
of chemotherapy benefit. The MammaPrint analysis uses a different data source to 
the other four tests. The Translational substudy of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, 
Alone or in Combination (TransATAC) study (used in the economic modelling) has a 
number of limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that all the tests can provide prognostic 
information on the risk of relapse; results were more varied in LN+ patients 
than in LN0 patients. There is limited and varying evidence that oncotype DX and 
MammaPrint are predictive of chemotherapy benefit. Health economic analyses 
indicate that some tests may have a favourable cost-effectiveness profile for 
certain patient subgroups; all estimates are subject to uncertainty. More 
evidence is needed on the prediction of chemotherapy benefit, long-term impacts 
and changes in UK pre-/post-chemotherapy decisions.

Plain Language Summary: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in 
women in England and Wales. Breast cancer, and its treatment, can have an impact 
on a person’s health-related quality of life and survival. Tumour profiling 
tests are used before chemotherapy. They test small samples of a patient’s 
tumour (removed during surgery) to find out whether the genes in it mean that a 
person has a high or low risk of the disease returning (relapse). If the risk is 
low, the patient may be able to avoid having chemotherapy and, therefore, avoid 
its side effects. Some tests might also be able to identify which patients will 
respond to chemotherapy. This study looked at the evidence for five tumour 
profiling tests. A total of 153 studies were identified. This study considered 
the results and the quality of the studies to find out if the tests are helpful. 
Most studies had design flaws (e.g. some patients had already had chemotherapy) 
that meant that the studies were of low quality overall. The results suggest 
that all of the tests can give information on the risk of relapse; however, some 
tests may be less useful in patients whose disease has spread to the lymph nodes 
(lymph node-positive disease). There was limited and varying evidence about 
whether or not two of these tests can also predict which patients will respond 
to chemotherapy. This study also looked at whether or not these tests represent 
good value for money for the NHS through cost-effectiveness analyses. The 
analyses showed that some of the tests may represent a good use of NHS resources 
for some patient groups; however, there was still a lot of uncertainty about 
this.

BACKGROUND: Newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular hypertension 
(OHT) are habitually treated with intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering eyedrops. 
Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a safe alternative to drops and is 
rarely used as first-line treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in newly 
diagnosed, treatment-naive patients with OAG or OHT, treated with two treatment 
pathways: topical IOP-lowering medication from the outset (Medicine-1st) or 
primary SLT followed by topical medications as required (Laser-1st). We also 
compared the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two pathways.
DESIGN: A 36-month pragmatic, unmasked, multicentre randomised controlled trial.
SETTINGS: Six collaborating specialist glaucoma clinics across the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Newly diagnosed patients with OAG or OHT in one or both eyes who 
were aged ≥ 18 years and able to provide informed consent and read and 
understand English. Patients needed to qualify for treatment, be able to perform 
a reliable visual field (VF) test and have visual acuity of at least 6 out of 36 
in the study eye. Patients with VF loss mean deviation worse than -12 dB in the 
better eye or -15 dB in the worse eye were excluded. Patients were also excluded 
if they had congenital, early childhood or secondary glaucoma or ocular 
comorbidities; if they had any previous ocular surgery except 
phacoemulsification, at least 1 year prior to recruitment or any active 
treatment for ophthalmic conditions; if they were pregnant; or if they were 
unable to use topical medical therapy or had contraindications to SLT.
INTERVENTIONS: SLT according to a predefined protocol compared with IOP-lowering 
eyedrops, as per national guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was HRQoL at 3 years [as measured 
using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire]. 
Secondary outcomes were cost and cost-effectiveness, disease-specific HRQoL, 
clinical effectiveness and safety.
RESULTS: Of the 718 patients enrolled, 356 were randomised to Laser-1st (initial 
SLT followed by routine medical treatment) and 362 to Medicine-1st (routine 
medical treatment only). A total of 652 (91%) patients returned the primary 
outcome questionnaire at 36 months. The EQ-5D-5L score was not significantly 
different between the two arms [adjusted mean difference 
(Laser-1st - Medicine-1st) 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.03; 
p = 0.23] at 36 months. Over 36 months, the proportion of visits at which IOP 
was within the target range was higher in the Laser-1st arm (93.0%, 95% CI 91.9% 
to 94.0%) than in the Medicine-1st arm (91.3%, 95% CI 89.9% to 92.5%), with 
IOP-lowering glaucoma surgery required in 0 and 11 patients, respectively. There 
was a 97% probability of Laser-1st being more cost-effective than Medicine-1st 
for the NHS, at a willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year of 
£20,000, with a reduction in ophthalmology costs of £458 per patient (95% of 
bootstrap iterations between -£585 and -£345).
LIMITATION: An unmasked design, although a limitation, was essential to capture 
any treatment effects on patients' perception. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a 
generic tool used in multiple settings and may not have been the most sensitive 
tool to investigate HRQoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with medication, SLT provided a stable, drop-free IOP 
control to 74.2% of patients for at least 3 years, with a reduced need for 
surgery, lower cost and comparable HRQoL. Based on the evidence, SLT seems to be 
the most cost-effective first-line treatment option for OAG and OHT, also 
providing better clinical outcomes.
FUTURE WORK: Longitudinal research into the clinical efficacy of SLT as a 
first-line treatment will specify the long-term differences of disease 
progression, treatment intensity and ocular surgery rates between the two 
pathways.

Plain Language Summary: Glaucoma is an eye condition in which the optic nerve 
becomes damaged and, if left untreated, will lead to loss of vision. Ocular 
hypertension (OHT) is the medical name for high pressure in the eye that 
increases the risk of getting glaucoma. Lowering the eye pressure is the only 
known way to prevent glaucoma from getting worse. Before this trial, the 
standard initial treatment of these conditions was the prescription of eyedrops 
to lower the pressure in the eye. An alternative is a laser therapy that is 
known to reduce the eye pressure. This study investigated if starting treatment 
of glaucoma or OHT with laser therapy (using eyedrops later, if needed) affected 
the patients’ quality of life (QoL) more or less than starting treatment with 
eyedrops alone. The study also investigated if initial treatment with laser and 
initial treatment with eyedrops are equally good at controlling eye pressure and 
are equally safe and how much they cost the NHS. Patients were randomly assigned 
to starting treatment with either laser or eyedrops and the two groups were then 
compared. The study found that for the first 3 years QoL was similar regardless 
of treatment. However, three-quarters of patients initially treated with laser 
did not need any eyedrops to control their eye pressure for 3 years. Patients 
initially treated with laser were less likely to require cataract surgery, and 
none needed any glaucoma surgery in the first 3 years. In contrast, among those 
patients treated with eyedrops, glaucoma surgery was required in 11 eyes (out of 
622 eyes). Initial treatment with laser was cheaper than initial treatment with 
eyedrops. The results of this study suggest that laser is an efficient, safe and 
cheaper alternative to eyedrops, and that three-quarters of the patients 
initially treated with laser do not need any eyedrops for the first 3 years of 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Truenat is a novel molecular assay that rapidly detects tuberculosis 
(TB) and rifampicin-resistance. Due to the portability of its battery-powered 
testing platform, it may be valuable in peripheral healthcare settings in India.
METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, we compared four TB diagnostic 
strategies for HIV-negative adults with presumptive TB: (1) sputum smear 
microscopy in designated microscopy centers (DMCs) (SSM); (2) Xpert MTB/RIF in 
DMCs (Xpert); (3) Truenat in DMCs (Truenat DMC); and (4) Truenat for 
point-of-care testing in primary healthcare facilities (Truenat POC). We 
projected life expectancy, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 
and 5-year budget impact of deploying Truenat POC in India's public sector. We 
defined a strategy "cost-effective" if its ICER was <US$990/year-of-life saved 
(YLS). Model inputs included: TB prevalence, 15% (among those not previously 
treated for TB) and 27% (among those previously treated for TB); sensitivity for 
TB detection, 89% (Xpert) and 86% (Truenat); per test cost, $12.63 (Xpert) and 
$13.20 (Truenat); and linkage-to-care after diagnosis, 84% (DMC) and 95% (POC). 
We varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared to SSM, Truenat POC increased life expectancy by 0.39 years 
and was cost-effective (ICER $210/YLS). Compared to Xpert, Truenat POC increased 
life expectancy by 0.08 years due to improved linkage-to-care and was 
cost-effective (ICER $120/YLS). In sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness 
of Truenat POC, relative to Xpert, depended on the diagnostic sensitivity of 
Truenat and linkage-to-care with Truenat. Deploying Truenat POC instead of Xpert 
increased 5-year expenditures by $270 million, due mostly to treatment costs. 
Limitations of our study include uncertainty in Truenat's sensitivity for TB and 
not accounting for the "start-up" costs of implementing Truenat in the field.
CONCLUSIONS: Used at the point-of-care in India, Truenat for TB diagnosis should 
improve linkage-to-care, increase life expectancy, and be cost-effective 
compared with smear microscopy or Xpert.

    Respirology. 2020 Mar;25(3):232-233.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Respiratory symptoms are recognizable to patients and 
may be markers of chronic disease and mortality risk. This risk may be easier to 
conceptualize if presented as remaining life expectancy (LE) rather than hazard 
ratios. We aimed to predict the remaining LE of older people with respiratory 
symptoms using data from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA).
METHODS: The ALSA is a prospective longitudinal cohort of older Australians 
(n = 2087) with 22 years of follow-up. The symptoms analysed were cough, 
shortness of breath (SOB) and wheeze. The implied impact on LE was estimated 
using a parametric survival function.
RESULTS: SOB predicted shorter LE irrespective of smoking status. Cough 
predicted shorter LE in former smokers and wheeze predicted shorter LE in 
current smokers. The estimated remaining LE of a 70-year-old male never smoker 
with no symptoms was 16.6 (95% CI: 14.8-17.7) years. The years of life lost for 
a 70-year-old male current smoker with cough, SOB and wheeze compared to a never 
smoker with no symptoms was 4.93 (95% CI: 2.87-7.36) years with only 2.99 (95% 
CI: 1.35-4.97) years being attributed to their current smoking and the remainder 
to their respiratory symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Respiratory symptoms predict mortality in older people. Cough in 
former smokers, wheeze in current smokers and all those with SOB require further 
investigations and disease-specific management.

The 2017 guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure in 
adults were published by the American College of Cardiology and the American 
Heart Association. The impact on clinical outcomes and costs needs to be 
estimated prior to adopting these guidelines in China. Data from a nationally 
representative sample in China were analyzed. The prevalence and treatment were 
calculated based on the criteria of the 2017 guidelines and 2018 Chinese 
guidelines among participants aged ≥35 years old. Direct medical costs, as well 
as the averted disability adjusted of life years and cost saving from 
cardiovascular disease events prevented by controlling hypertension, were also 
estimated. The prevalence and treatment rate of hypertension were 32.0% and 
43.4% according to the 2018 Chinese guidelines. Based on the 2017 guidelines, 
another 24.5% of the adult population (estimated 168.1 million) would be 
classified as having hypertension; of whom, about 32.1 million would need to be 
pharmaceutically treated to reach the current treatment rate of 43.4%. As a 
result, an estimated additional 42.7 billion US dollars  of the direct medical 
cost would be required for lifetime therapy. By preventing cardiovascular 
events, the new guidelines would reduce lifetime costs by 3.77 billion US 
dollars, while preventing 1.41 million disability adjusted of life years lost. 
Application of the 2017 guidelines in China will substantially increase the 
prevalence of hypertension and produce a large increase in therapy costs, 
although it would prevent cardiovascular disease events and save disability 
adjusted of life years.

OBJECTIVE: Reducing the burden of childhood severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is 
key to improving global child health outcomes. Assessing cost-effectiveness of 
nutrition interventions remains an important evidence gap. Disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) are a common indicator used in cost-effectiveness analyses. 
DALYs were established by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Recent 
iterations of the GBD have changed the methods used to calculate DALYs by 
dropping age-weighting and discounting (AD) and updating disability weights 
(DW). Cost-effectiveness analyses may use either local or international standard 
life expectancies (LE). Changes in model specifications for calculating DALYs 
may have implications for cost-effectiveness analyses using DALYs, interpreting 
historical DALY estimates, and related resource allocation decisions. The 
present study aimed to quantify the magnitude of change in estimates of DALYs 
attributable to SAM given recent methodological changes.
DESIGN: From secondary data analysis, using parameter values from routine 
programme monitoring data for two SAM treatment programmes and published 
literature, eight calculation models were created to estimate DALYs with and 
without AD, using different sets of DW, and local v. standard LE.
RESULTS: Different DW had a marginal effect on DALY estimates. Different LE had 
a small effect when AD was used, but a large effect when AD was not used.
CONCLUSIONS: DALY estimates are sensitive to the model used. This complicates 
comparisons between studies using different models and needs to be accounted for 
in decision making. It seems sensible for analyses to report results using
