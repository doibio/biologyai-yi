The buildup of phosphorus (P) in the soil is a major factor limiting the 
operating life of a wastewater land treatment system. In this study, we 
evaluated changes of chemical properties, P profiles, and adsorption isotherms 
in the soils of a Muskegon wastewater land treatment system, which has received 
wastewater for approximately 30 years. It was found that the pH in the 15-cm 
topsoil increased from approximately 5-6 in 1973 to approximately 7.4-7.8 in 
2003; a large amount of salt (e.g., Ca, Mg) in wastewater was adsorbed by the 
soil; the soil Al content (either exchangeable or oxalate extractable) 
decreased, while the oxalate-extractable Fe content remained at the same level. 
Ca-bound P accounted for > or = 70% of the total P adsorbed in the soil. The 
soil P adsorption capacity increased and was positively correlated with the 
concentration of exchangeable Ca in the soil. A higher concentration of 
exchangeable Ca was found in the 15-cm topsoil, where a higher total organic 
carbon was present. More P was accumulated in the upper soil than in the deeper 
soil. The adsorption of Ca in wastewater by the soil may extend the life 
expectancy of the Muskegon land treatment system.

Census and health data were analysed to determine changes in life expectancy at 
birth during 1987-2000 in the Kuwaiti population and to correlate these with 
cause-specific annual mortality rates. Life expectancy at birth rose from 73.3 
to 75.5 years with a gap between females and males, which increased from 2.2 to 
4.5 years. For all causes of death except hypertension and ill-defined 
conditions, males had higher mortality than females. The leading causes of death 
in males were ischaemic heart diseases, traffic accidents and cancer, while in 
females they were cancer, ischaemic heart diseases and hypertension. The 
problems of an ageing population will need to be considered in planning the 
health policies of Kuwait.

AIM: Extensive efforts are underway to develop methods for the detection and 
treatment of vulnerable/high-risk coronary artery plaques. We utilized decision 
analysis to evaluate the hypothetical clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness 
of a catheter-based strategy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Currently, stenotic coronary plaques are treated without 
regard to vulnerability. In a new strategy, vulnerable coronary plaques are 
detected with a catheter-based test and treated with a drug-eluting stent, 
regardless of degree of stenosis. A Markov-decision model was developed to 
compare the new strategy with current practice. Monte Carlo simulations were 
performed from a societal perspective, costs were converted to year 2003 U.S. 
dollars, and future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of assumptions on variables such 
as the prevalence of vulnerable plaques and treatment effect. In 60-year-old 
male patients with coronary stenoses the new strategy would be less expensive 
and more effective than current practice (37,045 dollars vs 38,257 dollars and 
10.23 vs 9.86 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively). The benefits 
of the new strategy were robust in sensitivity analyses (e.g., if the prevalence 
of vulnerable plaques in this patient group was 50% or more and the sensitivity 
and specificity of the new test were at least 0.80).
CONCLUSION: In selected patients with coronary artery stenosis, the detection of 
vulnerable plaques with a catheter-based test followed by their treatment with a 
drug-eluting stent could be a less expensive and more effective strategy than 
current practice. If applied to 1 million such patients in the United States 
undergoing catheterization, the new strategy would add 370,000 QALYs and save 
1.2 billion dollars per year.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2005 Oct 4;143(7):I44.

BACKGROUND: The spread of West Nile virus across North America and evidence of 
transmission by transfusion prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to 
encourage the development of methods to screen the blood supply.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid amplification 
testing for West Nile virus in the U.S. blood supply.
DESIGN: Markov cohort simulation.
DATA SOURCES: Outcome probabilities estimated from nucleic acid testing done for 
West Nile virus in 2003, data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and published literature. Costs were taken from an economic study of 
West Nile virus infection and from estimated test costs. TARGET POPULATIONS: 
Transfusion recipients, 60 years of age or older, with and without underlying 
immunocompromise.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: The authors compared 6 strategies, taking into consideration 
minipool (pools of 6 to 16 donations) versus individual donation testing, and 
the geographic and seasonal nature of West Nile virus activity.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and effects of each strategy based on the prevention of 
transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost-effectiveness of annual, national 
minipool testing was 483,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 
whereas the cost-effectiveness of annual, national individual donation testing 
was 897,000 dollars/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of targeted individual donation 
testing in an area experiencing an outbreak coupled with minipool testing 
elsewhere was 520,000 dollars/QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In 1-way analyses, the most important 
influences were the prevalence of West Nile virus and the cost of minipool 
testing and individual donation testing. The 95% range of results from 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis for targeted individual donation testing was 
256,000 dollars to 1,044,000 dollars/QALY.
LIMITATIONS: The outcomes of West Nile virus infection were based on data from 
the general population rather than from the population who received 
transfusions. The results are most useful in the context of geographically 
focused outbreaks of West Nile virus infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Using targeted individual donation testing to interdict blood 
donations that are positive for the West Nile virus is relatively cost-effective 
but is highly dependent on West Nile virus prevalence.

Competition between trans-translation and termination or elongation of 
translation.

The effects of tRNA, RF1 and RRF on trans-translation by tmRNA were examined 
using a stalled complex of ribosome prepared using a synthetic mRNA and pure 
Escherichia coli translation factors. No endoribonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA 
around the A site was found in the stalled ribosome and was required for the 
tmRNA action. When the A site was occupied by a stop codon, alanyl-tmRNA 
competed with RF1 with the efficiency of peptidyl-transfer to alanyl-tmRNA for 
trans-translation inversely correlated to the efficiency of translation 
termination. The competition was not affected by RF3. A sense codon also serves 
as a target for alanyl-tmRNA with competition of aminoacyl-tRNA. The extent of 
inhibition was decreased with the length of the 3'-extension of mRNA. RRF, only 
at a high concentration, slightly affected peptidyl-transfer for 
trans-translation, although it did not affect the canonical elongation. These 
results indicate that alanyl-tmRNA does not absolutely require the truncation of 
mRNA around the A site but prefers an mRNA of a short 3'-extension from the A 
site and that it can operate on either a sense or termination codon at the A 
site, at which alanyl-tmRNA competes with aminoacyl-tRNA, RF and RRF.

    Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2005 Oct 1;30(19):2227-9.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 55 consecutive patients with spinal 
metastases secondary to breast cancer who underwent surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of the Tokuhashi score for life 
expectancy in patients with breast cancer with spinal metastases.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The score, composed of 6 parameters each rated from 
0 to 2, has been proposed by Tokuhashi and colleagues for the prognostic 
assessment of patients with spinal metastases.
METHODS: A total of 55 patients surgically treated for vertebral metastases 
secondary to breast cancer were studied. The score was calculated for each 
patient and, according to Tokuhashi, the patients were divided into 3 groups 
with different life expectancy according to their total number of scoring 
points. In a second step, the grouping for prognosis was modified to get a 
better correlation of the predicted and definitive survival.
RESULTS: Applying the Tokuhashi score for the estimation of life expectancy of 
patients with breast cancer with vertebral metastases provided very reliable 
results. However, the original analysis by Tokuhashi showed a limited 
correlation between predicted and real survival for each prognostic group. 
Therefore, our patients were divided into modified prognostic groups regarding 
their total number of scoring points, leading to a higher significance of the 
predicted prognosis in each group (P < 0.0001), and a better correlation of the 
predicted and real survival.
CONCLUSION: The modified Tokuhashi score assists in decision making based on 
reliable estimators of life expectancy in patients with spinal metastases 
secondary to breast cancer.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of preoperative aneurysm and aortic 
neck diameter on clinical outcome after infrarenal abdominal endovascular 
aneurysm repair (EVAR). Data of patients in the European Collaborators Registry 
on Stent-Graft Techniques for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) 
registry base who underwent EVAR with Talent stent grafts were analyzed. Patient 
characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared among four groups defined by 
preoperative abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and proximal aortic neck diameter: 
A, AAA < or =60 mm and neck < or =26 mm; B, AAA >60 mm and neck < or =26 mm; C, 
AAA < or =60 mm and neck >26 mm; and D, AAA >60 mm and neck >26 mm. Over a 
7-year period, 1,317 patients underwent EVAR. Patients in groups B and D were 
significantly older and had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score 
compared with groups A and C (p=0.002 and 0.003, respectively). Mortality rate 
was highest in group D (p=0.002), as were rupture and conversion rates (p=0.015 
and 0.037, respectively). This study demonstrates that patients with an AAA >60 
mm and a proximal aortic neck >26 mm have worse clinical outcome after EVAR.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of 
interferon-alpha and doxycycline in patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma and to assess the effect of this treatment on serum vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and life expectancy greater than 4 months 
with radiologically evident advanced renal cell carcinoma were enrolled. Eight 
patients had prior nephrectomy and 10 patients were treated within 4 months of 
their diagnosis. Treatment consisted of interferon-alpha up to 9 million units 
subcutaneously three times per week and doxycycline 300 mg orally twice per day 
for weeks one and three of each four-week cycle. Toxicity was evaluated on a 
biweekly basis and response on a bimonthly basis. VEGF plasma levels were 
assessed monthly as a measure of potential antiangiogenic effect.
RESULTS: No objective responses were seen. The mean duration of study was 2.6 
cycles (range: 0.8-6.0 cycles). Three patients (17%) tolerated therapy and 
displayed stable disease for greater than four months. Five patients withdrew 
from study before the first response evaluation. Ten patients experienced grade 
2 gastrointestinal toxicity requiring dose reduction of doxycycline. Eight 
patients experienced grade 2 fatigue requiring dose reduction of interferon. 
VEGF plasma levels were initially suppressed in patients who demonstrated 
progressive disease but not in patients with stable disease.
CONCLUSION: This regimen of doxycycline and interferon-alpha was not efficacious 
as treatment for renal cell carcinoma. Plasma VEGF levels were significantly 
decreased during the first two cycles of treatment, but this does not correlate 
with clinical outcome.

Prostate cancer harbours the possibility of overtreatment more than any other 
malignant disease. Due to its slow growth, expected management is an established 
therapeutic option in newly diagnosed carcinomas. Improved diagnostic methods 
and the widespread use of PSA lead to earlier diagnosis of cancers that would 
not adversely affect the life expectancy of the patient, even when they were 
left untreated. Several statistical models have been published to identify such 
insignificant cancers; however, all such nomograms suffer from limited 
sensitivity and specificity. For the indication of expected management, 
comorbidity and life expectancy must be considered using risk scores and life 
tables. In general, expected management is a suitable option for elderly 
patients with low grade cancers. Young patients and those with intermediate or 
high-grade cancers are most likely to benefit from active local treatment.

Comment in
    Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Nov 1;41(9):1324-5.

BACKGROUND: Data from the United States and Europe show a population prevalence 
of baseline drug resistance of 8%-10% among human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected patients who are antiretroviral naive. Our objective was to 
determine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of genotype resistance 
testing for treatment-naive patients with chronic HIV infection.
METHODS: We utilized a state-transition model of HIV disease to project life 
expectancy, costs, and cost-effectiveness in a hypothetical cohort of 
antiretroviral-naive patients with chronic HIV infection. On the basis of a US 
survey of treatment-naive patients from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, we used a baseline prevalence of drug resistance of 8.3%.
RESULTS: A strategy of genotype-resistance testing at initial diagnosis of HIV 
infection increased per-person quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.0 months, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 23,900 dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained, compared with no genotype testing. The 
cost-effectiveness ratio for resistance testing remained less than 50,000 
dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, unless the prevalence of 
resistance was < or =1%, a level lower than those reported in most regions of 
the United States and Europe. In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness 
remained favorable through wide variations in baseline assumptions, including 
variations in genotype cost, prevalence of resistance overall and to individual 
drug classes, and sensitivity of resistance testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-resistance testing of chronically HIV-infected, 
antiretroviral-naive patients is likely to improve clinical outcomes and is 
cost-effective, compared with other HIV care in the United States. Resistance 
testing at the time of diagnosis should be the standard of care.

A physician's perspective on the dining experience in long-term care.

Unfortunately, weight loss is frequently an expected part of a patient's normal 
nursing home residential trajectory. However, the clinical team should determine 
if the weight loss is reversible. The patient's clinical condition is often such 
that weight loss cannot be reversed or improved. Currently, life expectancy for 
a patient who has been admitted to a nursing home is approximately 2.2 years. 
These patients have been suffering from multiple medical conditions that have 
ravaged their body and mind and left them in a frail condition. Food has many 
personal meanings to each resident that can improve the quality of a person's 
few remaining years. While many specialty diets are available to patients in a 
hospital, many of these diets may not be appropriate for patients who reside in 
a nursing home. Careful attention should be given to the prescription and 
preparation of meals in long-term care facilities. A focus on liberalizing diets 
in long-term care facilities can lead to improved quality of life for many 
patients.

University, Sohngaardsholmsvej 57, 9000 Aalborg, Denmark. ahn@bio.aau.dk

A model concept for prediction of sulfide buildup in sewer networks is 
presented. The model concept is an extension to--and a further development 
of--the WATS model (Wastewater Aerobic-anaerobic Transformations in Sewers), 
which has been developed by Hvitved-Jacobsen and co-workers at Aalborg 
University. In addition to the sulfur cycle, the WATS model simulates changes in 
dissolved oxygen and carbon fractions of different biodegradability. The sulfur 
cycle was introduced via six processes: 1. sulfide production taking place in 
the biofilm covering the permanently wetted sewer walls; 2. biological sulfide 
oxidation in the permanently wetted biofilm; 3. chemical and biological sulfide 
oxidation in the water phase; 4. sulfide precipitation with metals present in 
the wastewater; 5. emission of hydrogen sulfide to the sewer atmosphere and 6. 
adsorption and oxidation of hydrogen sulfide on the moist sewer walls where 
concrete corrosion may take place.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an independent risk factor for multi-vessel coronary 
artery disease: a case control study.

The risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease is increased in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) but data on the burden of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with RA are 
lacking. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of Olmsted County (MN, 
USA) residents with RA and new-onset coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 75) in 
comparison with age-and sex-matched controls with newly diagnosed CAD (n = 128). 
Angiographic scores of the first coronary angiogram and data on CV risk factors 
and CV events on follow-up were obtained by chart abstraction. Patients with RA 
were more likely to have multi-vessel coronary involvement at first coronary 
angiogram compared with controls (P = 0.002). Risk factors for CAD including 
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking history were not 
significantly different in the two cohorts. RA remained a significant risk 
factor for multi-vessel disease after adjustment for age, sex and history of 
hyperlipidemia. The overall rate of CV events was similar in RA patients and 
controls; however, there was a trend for increased CV death in patients with RA. 
In a nested cohort of patients with RA and CAD (n = 27), we measured levels of 
pro-inflammatory CD4+CD28null T cells by flow cytometry. These T cells have been 
previously implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD and RA. Indeed, CD4+CD28null T 
cells were significantly higher in patients with CAD and co-existent RA than in 
controls with stable angina (P = 0.001) and reached levels found in patients 
with acute coronary syndromes. Patients with RA are at increased risk for 
multi-vessel CAD, although the risk of CV events was not increased in our study 
population. Expansion of CD4+CD28null T cells in these patients may contribute 
to the progression of atherosclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Two putative methionine aminopeptidase genes, map (essential) and 
yflG (non-essential), were identified in the genome sequence of Bacillus 
subtilis. We investigated whether they can function as methionine 
aminopeptidases and further explored possible reasons for their essentiality or 
dispensability in B. subtilis.
RESULTS: In silico analysis of MAP evolution uncovered a coordinated pattern of 
MAP and deformylase that did not correlate with the pattern of 16S RNA 
evolution. Biochemical assays showed that both MAP (MAP_Bs) and YflG (YflG_Bs) 
from B. subtilis overproduced in Escherichia coli and obtained as pure proteins 
exhibited a methionine aminopeptidase activity in vitro. Compared with MAP_Bs, 
YflG_Bs was approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient when assayed on 
synthetic peptide substrates. Both map and yflG genes expressed in multi-copy 
plasmids could complement the function of a defective map gene in the 
chromosomes of both E. coli and B. subtilis. In contrast, lacZ gene 
transcriptional fusions showed that the promoter activity of map was 50 to 
100-fold higher than that of yflG. Primer extension analysis detected the 
transcription start site of the yflG promoter. Further work identified that YvoA 
acted as a possible weak repressor of yflG expression in B. subtilis in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Both MAP_Bs and YflG_Bs are functional methionine aminopeptidases in 
vitro and in vivo. The high expression level of map and low expression level of 
yflG may account for their essentiality and dispensality in B. subtilis, 
respectively, when cells are grown under laboratory conditions. Their difference 
in activity on synthetic substrates suggests that they have different protein 
targets in vivo.

Because the life expectancy of patients infected with HIV has been prolonged, 
liver diseases have assumed far greater importance as a cause of morbidity and 
mortality in these patients. Given the shared risks of transmission, patients 
who have HIV often are coinfected with hepatotrophic viruses such as hepatitis C 
and hepatitis B. Further, antiretroviral therapy (ART) used by patients who have 
HIV is often hepatotoxic, contributing to liver damage. With increasing 
immunosuppression caused by AIDS, patients who have HIV have to deal with these 
issues and the increased risk of infection with opportunistic viral, fungal, 
bacterial, and protozoal pathogens. In addition, steatosis and lipodystrophy now 
are recognized more commonly in patients who have HIV, particularly in the 
setting of ART. Thus, understanding of liver diseases in the setting of HIV 
infection becomes an important focus in caring these individuals. There have 
been numerous advances in the treatment of liver disease in patients who have 
HIV, particularly in treating viral hepatitis C and B. This article reviews 
various liver manifestations in patients who have HIV and the recent advances in 
diagnostic and therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND: Eight randomized trials have evaluated whether the prophylactic use 
of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) improves survival among 
patients who are at risk for sudden death due to left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction but who have not had a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. We 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of the ICD in the populations represented in 
these primary-prevention trials.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model of the cost, quality of life, survival, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness of the prophylactic implantation of an ICD, as 
compared with control therapy, among patients with survival and mortality rates 
similar to those in each of the clinical trials. We modeled the efficacy of the 
ICD as a reduction in the relative risk of death on the basis of the hazard 
ratios reported in the individual clinical trials.
RESULTS: Use of the ICD increased lifetime costs in every trial. Two trials--the 
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Patch Trial and the Defibrillator in Acute 
Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT)--found that the prophylactic implantation 
of an ICD did not reduce the risk of death and thus was both more expensive and 
less effective than control therapy. For the other six trials--the Multicenter 
Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) I, MADIT II, the Multicenter 
Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT), the Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic 
Cardiomyopathy Treatment Evaluation (DEFINITE) trial, the Comparison of Medical 
Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure (COMPANION) trial, and the 
Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT)--the use of an ICD was 
projected to add between 1.01 and 2.99 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 
between 68,300 dollars and 101,500 dollars in cost. Using base-case assumptions, 
we found that the cost-effectiveness of the ICD as compared with control therapy 
in these six populations ranged from 34,000 dollars to 70,200 dollars per QALY 
gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that this cost-effectiveness ratio would 
remain below 100,000 dollars per QALY as long as the ICD reduced mortality for 
seven or more years.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic implantation of an ICD has a cost-effectiveness ratio 
below 100,000 dollars per QALY gained in populations in which a significant 
device-related reduction in mortality has been demonstrated.

Health, economic evaluation, and critical care.

Health Sciences Center, Ontario, Canada.

In the past 2 decades, societal spending on health care has become an 
international concern. The United States currently spends more than 1.6 trillion 
dollars per year on health care--approximately 15% of the gross domestic 
product. The provision of care to critically ill patients accounts for a 
disproportionate share of these health care dollars--approximately 13% of 
hospital costs, 4% of national health expenditures, and 0.5% to 1% of the gross 
domestic product. This enormous investment necessitates careful evaluation of 
our interventions and their associated expense. Economic evaluation can aid 
policy makers and health care professionals in comparing the relative and 
incremental value of disparate and expensive therapies and also inform decisions 
about which interventions provide good value for the health care dollar. In this 
review, we will highlight landmark publications over the past decades that have 
helped to shape the field of economic evaluations for critical care medicine.

Evaluation of four microkeratome models: quality and reproducibility of cut edge 
and cut surface as determined by scanning electron microscopy.

PURPOSE: To compare the quality and reproducibility of cuts produced by four 
automatic microkeratomes: Amadeus, Hansatome, Summit-Krumeich-Barraquer (SKBM), 
and Supratome. For the adjustable models (Amadeus and SKBM), the effects of 
oscillation frequency and blade feed rate were determined.
METHODS: Eight cuts (flap thickness 160 to 180 microm) were made with each 
microkeratome at each parameter setting and examined using a scanning electron 
microscope. Quality of the cut surface was scored for each flap according to 
four criteria, and results were averaged to give a maximum possible score of 64. 
Quality of the cut edges was scored from 1 (blurred indistinct edge) to 3 (sharp 
and clearly visible edge).
RESULTS: The four microkeratomes performed similarly on overall quality of the 
cut surface (range: 78% to 88% of theoretical maximum). The Hansatome scored 
highest (88%), followed by SKBM (86%; 1.0 mm/s blade feed and 7000 rpm 
oscillation), Amadeus (84%; 2.5 mm/s, 8000 rpm), Supratome (84%; 16.6 mm/s, 
12,500 rpm), Amadeus (81%; 3.0 mm/s and 13,000 rpm), and SKBM (78%; 1.5 mm/s, 
14,000 rpm). Performance differences were clearer for cut edge quality. The 
Amadeus produced cuts of the highest quality in 62.5% of cases (at both 
settings), compared with only 12.5% of cases with the Hansatome, 25% of cases 
with the Supratome and SKMB (1.0 mm/s, 7000 rpm), and in no cases with the SKBM 
at 1.5 mm/s and 14,000 rpm.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, high frequency with low blade feed rate is desirable for 
reproducible sharp edges and cut area quality. However, at very high frequencies 
(e.g., 14,000 rpm with the SKBM) tissue is displaced, producing an uneven cut 
area. Oscillation/feed quotients of 2000 to 4000 (rpm/mm x s) are a good 
compromise. Sharp edges are believed to reduce the risk of comeal erosion, 
introduction of epithelial cells into the interfacial region, and scarring 
during wound healing.

Technology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan.

Although the possible involvement of neurotrophic factors in itchy skins of 
atopic dermatitis has been predicted, the exact mechanism by which itch is 
induced remains unclear. Since nerve growth factor (NGF) has crucial effects on 
development and functions of sensory nerves, we determined production of NGF and 
extension of nerve fibers in skins of NC/NgaTnd mice with or without atopic 
dermatitis. NC/NgaTnd mice spontaneously develop atopic dermatitis-like skin 
lesions when they are raised in air-unregulated conventional circumstances. We 
quantified scratching behavior of NC/NgaTnd mice during the development of 
dermatitis using a novel analytical system and compared to clinical skin 
severity scores. A significant correlation between the severity of dermatitis 
and the increase in the number of scratches was identified, indicating that 
scratching behavior may associate with clinical skin conditions. NGF contents in 
the skin lesions of conventional NC/NgaTnd mice were significantly higher than 
those in SPF mice. Positive reactions for NGF were observed in keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts in affected skins of conventional NC/NgaTnd mice. 
Immunohistochemical analysis showed the extension of protein gene product 
9.5-positive nerve fibers from the dermis toward the epidermis at the skin 
lesions. These results suggest that sensory nerves induced by NGF may contribute 
to development of itch, and that NGF produced at the affected site may provide 
abnormal skin sensitivity in atopic dermatitis.

Unusual features associated with cranial openings of optic canal in dry adult 
human skulls.

One hundred and eighty six dry adult human skulls (372 sides) were studied in 
order to reveal the presence of unusual features--such as recess, fissure and 
notch--in the cranial opening of the optic canal. Recess, an extension of the 
lateral wall, was found in 229 (61.5%) sides. Fissure, an irregular 
discontinuity above the lateral recess, was observed in 158 (42.4%) sides. 
Notch, a gap in the posterior-most limit of the roof, was seen in 66 (17.7%) 
sides. These were commonly seen bilaterally. The etiology of these was 
attributed to the development of the optic canal. During intrauterine life the 
optic canal is in the form of a large keyhole shaped foramen, which slowly 
transforms into the adult canal. A developmental arrest at an early stage may 
lead to the formation of recesses and fissures.

Gene expression by human monocytes from peripheral blood in response to exposure 
to metals.

Murtenstrasse 35, CH-3010 Berne, Switzerland.

With increasing life expectancy and active lifestyles, the longevity of 
arthroplasties has become an important problem in orthopaedic surgery and will 
remain so until novel approaches to joint preservation have been developed. The 
sensitivity of the recipient to the metal alloys may be one of the factors 
limiting the lifespan of implants. In the present study, the response of human 
monocytes from peripheral blood to an exposure to metal ions was investigated, 
using the method of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based low-density 
arrays. Upon stimulation with bivalent (Co2+ and Ni2+) and trivalent (Ti3+) 
cations and with the calcium antagonist LaCl3, the strength of the elicited 
monocytic response was in the order of Co2+ > or = Ni2+ > Ti3+ > or = LaCl3. The 
transcriptional regulation of the majority of genes affected by the exposure of 
monocytes to Co2+ and Ni2+ was similar. Some genes critically involved in the 
processes of inflammation and bone resorption, however, were found to be 
differentially regulated by these bivalent cations. The data demonstrate that 
monocytic gene expression is adapted in response to metal ions and that this 
response is, in part, specific for the individual metals. It is suggested that 
metal alloys used in arthroplasties may affect the extent of inflammation and 
bone resorption in the peri-implant tissues in dependence of their chemical 
composition.

Renal dialysis: counting the cost versus counting the need.

Stanton J.

The relatively "lean and mean" provision of renal dialysis in Britain is a 
notorious example of "covert rationing", apparently achieved by a lack of 
central policy. Then in its first experiment in "target-setting" in the NHS in 
1984, central government used the profession's preferred measure of need, thus 
promoting expansion of renal services, at almost exactly the time when the 
"quality-adjusted life year" (QALY) developed by health economists indicated 
that renal dialysis scored low in cost-benefit terms. This chapter examines 
these conundrums in terms of centre-periphery relations, clinical autonomy 
versus collective direction, and the politics of competing ways of counting need 
and cost.

donor-recipient relationship shared by MZ co-twins. Next, a recent analysis of 
MZ co-twin differences in the epigenetic profile and associations with 
differences in life history factors is presented. This work has been the focus 
of considerable attention by scientists and the media. The final section of this 
column summarizes information and events concerning twins' longevity, screen 
careers, older parenting of twins and the origin of the word 'twin'.

Cost-effectiveness of screening for deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound at 
admission to stroke rehabilitation.

OBJECTIVE: This project was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the practice of 
routine Doppler ultrasound screening for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients 
with ischemic stroke at the time of admission to rehabilitation.
DESIGN: A decision-analysis model was created to compare 2 approaches for 
detecting DVT in a stroke population: (1) screening all patients with acute 
ischemic stroke at admission to stroke rehabilitation for DVT by Doppler 
ultrasound with subsequent treatment; or (2) clinical surveillance for signs of 
DVT and treatment after confirmation by Doppler ultrasound. The prevalence of 
DVT, risk of complication from DVT, and risk of complication from treatment were 
obtained from published reports. Costs are in 2004 dollars and the effectiveness 
was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. We conducted these 
analyses from a societal perspective.
SETTING: Inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit.
PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable.
INTERVENTION: Screening all patients with acute ischemic stroke at admission to 
stroke rehabilitation for DVT by Doppler ultrasound with subsequent treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost in 2004 dollars per QALY gained by screening all 
patients with acute ischemic stroke at admission to stroke rehabilitation for 
DVT by Doppler ultrasound with subsequent treatment.
RESULTS: The expected utility of screening patients with ischemic stroke for DVT 
by Doppler ultrasound on admission to rehabilitation is 1.875 QALYs and that of 
not screening is 1.872 QALYs. The expected gain is .0026 QALYs (23 h). Obtaining 
this increase in quality-adjusted life incurs additional cost of 168 dollars per 
stroke patient and a marginal cost-effectiveness of 67,200 dollars for each QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This study estimates that the cost-effectiveness ratio is 
considerably higher than that reported in other rehabilitation conditions and 
higher than the commonly stated level for an intervention to be considered 
cost-effective. The difference from previous reports primarily relates to the 
shorter life expectancy following stroke, the prevalence of occult DVT at 
admission, rate of complications of anticoagulation, and the estimates of the 
screening's test characteristics used in our study. Further study of these areas 
is likely to contribute to improving our understanding of the most appropriate 
care of these patients.

A comparison of individual and social time trade-off values for health states in 
the general population.

Institutet, Norrbacka, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. kristina.burstrom@sll.se

This study aimed to compare directly elicited individual time trade-off (TTO) 
values in a general population sample with the social values derived using the 
UK EQ-5D index tariff. In the Stockholm County 1998 postal Public Health Survey 
(n=4950, 20-88 years), the EQ-5D self-classifier, a TTO and a rating scale (RS) 
question were included (n=2549 for all three questions). The mean TTO (EQ-5D) 
value was 0.943 (0.890) in the youngest age-group and 0.699 (0.733) in the 
oldest age-group. The difference between TTO and EQ-5D values was greater in 
more severe health status groups was. The same equation as for the UK EQ-5D 
index tariff was estimated for TTO and RS and resulted in significant and 
consistent coefficients for nearly all dimensions. The coefficients for moderate 
problems were closer to the EQ-5D index tariff than the coefficients for severe 
problems. Age was also significant after controlling for the EQ-5D dimensions 
(p<0.05). The results suggest that individual and social TTO values differ 
systematically and that the difference is greater the more severe the health 
status is. The social EQ-5D index tariff may also underestimate the severity in 
health status at older ages; age appears to correlate with additional health 
problems not captured by the EQ-5D classification.

(1)Clinic of Preventive and Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University 
of Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro.

AIM: To examine the success of the one-appointment pulpotomy technique with 
three different medicaments on primary molar teeth.
METHODS: The study was conducted on 104 primary molars in 104 children with an 
indication for pulpotomy treatment on at least one primary molar. Primary teeth 
were treated with either formocresol (FC) (34 teeth), calcium hydroxide (CA) (33 
teeth) or ferric sulphate (FS) (37 teeth) using standardised criteria for the 
pulpotomy procedures. Teeth were clinically and radiographically evaluated 
during the examination period of 18 months.
RESULTS: The clinical success rate at 18 months for the FC and FS groups was 
90.9% and 89.2%, respectively. The CA showed an overall clinical success rate of 
82.3%, with no statistical difference compared with either the FC or FS groups. 
The overall radiographic success for each technique was: FC 84.8%, CA 76.5%, and 
FS 81.1%. The presence of a dentine bridge above the pulp amputation site was 
observed radiographically for CA (47%), and FS (40.5%) pulpotomies without any 
statistical difference. Radiographic examination did not reveal the presence of 
a dentine bridge for any of the teeth treated with FC pulpotomy.
CONCLUSION: Favourable clinical and radiographic success rates of ferric 
sulphate pulpotomy, comparable to formocresol were obtained. Therefore, ferric 
sulphate can be recommended as a pulpotomy medicament.
