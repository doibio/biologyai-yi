expectancy using the Arriaga method.
METHODS: The required data was extracted from the death registration system 
(DRS) and statistical center of Iran. First, we calculated life expectancy at 
birth for 31 provinces of Iran using life tables, and subsequently, two 
provinces with the highest and the lowest life expectancy were determined. To 
decompose the age and cause share in the life expectancy gap between the two 
provinces, we used Arriaga's method.
RESULTS: Tehran with 80.09 years and Sistan and Baluchistan with 72.9 years had 
the highest and the lowest life expectancy among Iranian Provinces respectively. 
As a result, the life expectancy gap between Tehran and Sistan and Baluchistan 
was 7.19 years. Results of age decomposition showed that the highest share in 
the life expectancy gap attributed to the age group under one year (1.25 years). 
In terms of the cause of death, the highest percentage belonged to hypertensive 
diseases with a share of 1.77 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide gap between two provinces with the highest and the 
lowest life expectancy. Age less than one year and hypertensive diseases were 
major factors in this inequality. Therefore, policy-makers should concentrate on 
improvement of survival in children and the reduction of hypertensive diseases 
to promote life expectancy in Sistan and Baluchistan.

BACKGROUND: CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare, X-linked, developmental 
and epileptic encephalopathy characterised by severe global developmental 
impairment and seizures that can begin in the first few months after birth and 
are often treatment refractory. Ganaxolone, an investigational neuroactive 
steroid, reduced seizure frequency in an open-label, phase 2 trial that included 
patients with CDD. We aimed to further assess the efficacy and safety of 
ganaxolone in patients with CDD-associated refractory epilepsy.
METHODS: In the double-blind phase of this randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 
3 trial, done at 39 outpatient clinics in eight countries (Australia, France, 
Israel, Italy, Poland, Russia, the UK, and the USA), patients were eligible if 
they were aged 2-21 years with a pathogenic or probably pathogenic CDKL5 variant 
and at least 16 major motor seizures (defined as bilateral tonic, generalised 
tonic-clonic, bilateral clonic, atonic, or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic) per 
28 days in each 4-week period of an 8-week historical period. After a 6-week 
prospective baseline period, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an 
interactive web response system to receive either enteral adjunctive ganaxolone 
or matching enteral adjunctive placebo (maximum dose 63 mg/kg per day for 
patients weighing ≤28 kg or 1800 mg/day for patients weighing >28 kg) for 17 
weeks. Patients, caregivers, investigators (including those analysing data), 
trial staff, and the sponsor (other than the investigational product manager) 
were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
percentage change in median 28-day major motor seizure frequency from the 
baseline period to the 17-week double-blind phase and was analysed (using a 
Wilcoxon-rank sum test) in all patients who received at least one dose of trial 
treatment and for whom baseline data were available. Safety (compared 
descriptively across groups) was analysed in all patients who received at least 
one dose of trial treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT03572933, and the open-label extension phase is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between June 25, 2018, and July 2, 2020, 114 patients were screened 
for eligibility, of whom 101 (median age 6 years [IQR 3 to 10]) were randomly 
assigned to receive either ganaxolone (n=50) or placebo (n=51). All patients 
received at least one dose of a study drug, but seizure frequency for one 
patient in the ganaxolone group was not recorded at baseline and so the primary 
endpoint was analysed in a population of 100 patients. There was a median 
percentage change in 28-day major motor seizure frequency of -30·7% (IQR -49·5 
to -1·9) in the ganaxolone group and of -6·9% (-24·1 to 39·7) in the placebo 
group (p=0·0036). The Hodges-Lehmann estimate of median difference in responses 
to ganaxolone versus placebo was -27·1% (95% CI -47·9 to - 9·6). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 43 (86%) of 50 patients in the 
ganaxolone group and in 45 (88%) of 51 patients in the placebo group. 
Somnolence, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infections occurred in at least 
10% of patients in the ganaxolone group and more frequently than in the placebo 
group. Serious adverse events occurred in six (12%) patients in the ganaxolone 
group and in five (10%) patients in the placebo group. Two (4%) patients in the 
ganaxolone group and four (8%) patients in the placebo group discontinued the 
trial. There were no deaths in the double-blind phase.
INTERPRETATION: Ganaxolone significantly reduced the frequency of CDD-associated 
seizures compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated. Results from 
what is, to our knowledge, the first controlled trial in CDD suggest a potential 
treatment benefit for ganaxolone. Long-term treatment is being assessed in the 
ongoing open-label extension phase of this trial.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the performance of the EQ-5D-Y 3-level 
version (Y-3L) and the expanded 5-level version, the EQ-5D-Y 5-level version 
(Y-5L).
METHODS: Children or adolescents with an acute or chronic health condition and 
from the general population completed the Y-5L and Y-3L self-report 
questionnaires. The performance of the Y-5L and Y-3L was determined by comparing 
feasibility, redistribution of dimension responses, discriminatory power, 
validity, and test-retest reliability.
RESULTS: A total of 550 children/adolescents completed baseline measures and 173 
completed repeat measures. The ceiling effect decreased by 15% from the Y-3L to 
Y-5L. Informativity of dimensions improved by 0.094 on the Y-5L. There was a 
range of 4% to 9% inconsistent responses moving from the Y-3L to Y-5L. 
Convergent validity of the visual analog scale and Y-3L and Y-5L dimensions was 
similar and weak to moderate (rs range 0.18-0.38) but similar and strong on 
paired Y-3L and Y-5L dimensions: Kendall tau B (range 0.69-0.80) and gamma 
(range 0.92-0.98). The Y-5L and Y-3L showed moderate to substantial agreement 
for test-retest reliability across dimensions and visual analog scale scores in 
stable chronic health conditions and fair agreement for the general population.
CONCLUSION: The Y-5L is a valid, reliable extension of the Y-3L for children or 
adolescents across health conditions and healthy children/adolescents. The 
expanded levels reduced the ceiling effect. The relative informativity of report 
across dimensions increased on the Y-5L compared with the Y-3L with retention of 
the evenness of reporting. The convergent validity and test-retest reliability 
of the Y-5L was comparable with the Y-3L.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gallbladder and biliary diseases (GBDs) are one of the most 
prevalent medical issues in the digestive system. This study was designed to 
describe the characteristics of prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) of GBDs during 1990-2019 using data from the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019.
METHODS: Prevalence, death, and DALYs for GBDs in different locations, years, 
sex, and age groups were estimated using DisMod-MR 2.1 and a generic Cause of 
Death Ensemble Modeling approach. Countries and territories were categorized 
according to socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles.
RESULTS: The prevalence cases (127 345 732 to 193 493 378), death cases (82 430 
to 124 941), and DALYs (4 604 821 to 6 352 738) of GBDs increased from 1990 to 
2019. However, the age-standardized rates of indicators decreased over the 
30-year period (prevalence, 2851.84 to 2350.78 per 100 000 population; death, 
2.40 to 1.65 per 100 000 population; DALYs, 106.76 to 78.25 per 100 000 
population). In 2019, the high and middle-high SDI regions had higher 
age-standardized prevalence rates, the low SDI region had the highest 
age-standardized death rate, and the middle SDI region had the highest DALYs and 
age-standardized DALYs rate of GBDs. Being female, older age, and high body mass 
index were important risk factors for the burden of GBDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, there were improvements in overall health with regard to 
GBDs over the 30 years. However, the prevention of GBDs should be promoted in 
middle, middle-high, and high SDI regions, while more medical resources should 
be provided to improve treatment levels in low SDI region.

BACKGROUND: The remaining lifetime risk (RLR) is the probability of developing 
an outcome over the remainder of one's lifespan at any given age. The RLR for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in three 20-year periods were 
assessed using data from a single community-based cohort study of predominantly 
White participants.
METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Framingham study in 3 epochs (epoch 1, 
1960-1979; epoch 2, 1980-1999; epoch 3, 2000-2018) were evaluated. The RLR of a 
first ASCVD event (myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or 
stroke) from 45 years of age (adjusting for competing risk of death) in the 3 
epochs were compared overall, and according to the following strata: sex, body 
mass index, blood pressure and cholesterol categories, diabetes, smoking, and 
Framingham risk score groups.
RESULTS: There were 317 849 person-years of observations during the 3 epochs 
(56% women; 94% White) and 4855 deaths occurred. Life expectancy rose by 10.1 
years (men) to 11.9 years (women) across the 3 epochs. There were 1085 ASCVD 
events over the course of 91 330 person-years in epoch 1, 1330 ASCVD events over 
the course of 107 450 person-years in epoch 2, and 775 ASCVD events over the 
course of 119 069 person-years in epoch 3. The mean age at onset of first ASCVD 
event was greater in the third epoch by 8.1 years (men) to 10.3 years (women) 
compared with the first epoch. The RLR of ASCVD from 45 years of age declined 
from 43.7% in epoch 1 to 28.1% in epoch 3 (P<0.0001), a finding that was 
consistent in both sexes (RLR [epoch 1 versus epoch 3], 36.3% versus 26.5% 
[women]; 52.5% versus 30.1% [men]; P<0.001 for both). The lower RLR of ASCVD in 
the last 2 epochs was observed consistently across body mass index, blood 
pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and Framingham risk score strata 
(P<0.001 for all). The RLR of coronary heart disease events and stroke declined 
in both sexes (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 6 decades, mean life expectancy increased and the RLR 
of ASCVD decreased in the community-based, predominantly White Framingham study. 
The residual burden of ASCVD underscores the importance of continued and 
effective primary prevention efforts with better screening for risk factors and 
their effective treatment.

The aim of the current study was to review the current state and characteristics 
of the elderly population in China in the context of aging, difficulties and 
challenges faced by older people, and efforts of the current Chinese Government 
in this area. The process of population aging in China began to accelerate in 
the late 1970s and has continued to increase at a rate of about 3.2% per year 
since then. This process took more than 45 years in developed countries, while 
it took only about 27 years in China, and aging may continue to increase for a 
long time. China is now moving toward a superannuated society due to declining 
fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. There is a great need for care 
due to the high disease burden among older people. However, more than 1 million 
"families have lost their only child", and this number is increasing annually by 
about 76,000; moreover, there are a large number of "deficient families [with an 
injured family member]" in China. These families face greater difficulties due 
to aging and need to rely on society for more support given the lack of care 
provided by their children or spouses. The current study has focused on 
improving the quality of life of older people, helping them achieve healthy 
aging, and to assist the country in further providing care for the elderly.

Exploring Sex-Related Differences in Microglia May Be a Game-Changer in 
Precision Medicine.

Lynch MA(1).

Author information:
(1)Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.

One area of microglial biology that has been relatively neglected until recently 
is sex differences and this is in spite of the fact that sex is a risk factor in 
several diseases that are characterized by neuroinflammation and, by extension, 
microglial activation. Why these sex differences exist is not known but the 
panoply of differences extend to microglial number, genotype and phenotype. 
Significantly, several of these sex-related differences are also evident in 
health and change during life emphasizing the dynamic and plastic nature of 
microglia. This review will consider how age impacts on sex-related differences 
in microglia and ask whether the advancement of personalized medicine demands 
that a greater focus is placed on studying sex-related differences in microglia 
in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and models of inflammatory stress 
and trauma in order to make true progress in dealing with these conditions.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of obesity has increased exponentially in recent 
decades, being one of the diseases that most affects global health. It is a 
chronic disease associated with multiple comorbidities, which lead to a decrease 
in life expectancy and quality of life. It requires a multidisciplinary approach 
by a specialized medical team. Obesity can be treated with conservative or with 
surgical treatments that will depend on the characteristics of the patient.
OBJECTIVE/METHODOLOGY: The referenced surgery can be performed using different 
surgical techniques that are analyzed in the present work through an exhaustive 
narrative bibliographic review in the PubMed and Cochrane databases, as well as 
in UpToDate.
RESULTS: Currently, those most used are restrictive techniques, specifically 
vertical gastrectomy and mixed techniques, with gastric bypass being the "gold 
standard".
CONCLUSIONS: In order to choose one technique or another, the characteristics of 
each patient and the experience of the surgical team must be taken into account.

Understanding the process of human placentation is important to the development 
of strategies for treatment of pregnancy complications. Several animal and in 
vitro human model systems for the general study human placentation have been 
used. The field has expanded rapidly over the past decades to include stem 
cell-derived approaches that mimic preclinical placental development, and these 
stem cell-based models have allowed us to better address the physiology and 
pathophysiology of normal and compromised trophoblast (TB) sublineage 
development. The application of transcriptomic approaches to these models has 
uncovered limitations that arise when studying the distinctive characteristics 
of the large and fragile multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB), which plays a 
key role in fetal-maternal communication during pregnancy. The extension of 
these technologies to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is just now being 
reported and will allow, for the first time, a reproducible and robust approach 
to the study of the developmental underpinnings of late-manifesting diseases 
such as preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth retardation in a manner that 
is patient- and disease-specific. Here, we will first focus on the application 
of various RNA-seq technologies to TB, prior limitations in fully accessing the 
STB transcriptome, and recent leveraging of single nuclei RNA sequencing 
(snRNA-seq) technology to improve our understanding of the STB transcriptome. 
Next, we will discuss new stem-cell derived models that allow for disease- and 
patient-specific study of pregnancy disorders, with a focus on the study of STB 
developmental abnormalities in PE that combine snRNA-seq approaches and these 
new in vitro models.

Thailand is an exemplar of the challenges faced in addressing the increasing 
dual demands of aging populations and increasing incidence of non-communicable 
disease (NCDs). By understanding the dilemmas and solutions posed by Thailand, 
we propose a framework of key factors to be addressed in order to accelerate 
capacity in addressing the NCDs challenges in aging populations. Methods 
proposed by world health organizations to improve population health could impact 
NCDs if Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) are increased as well as life 
expectancy through these measures. Four recommendations for achieving these 
objectives are discussed: expand investments in health care infrastructure for 
NCDs prevention and early detection; expand public health policies to full 
population health goals; expand to universal coverage for health care access; 
engage multi-sectoral constituencies in policy and strategic implementation 
programs for health. With the emergence of an aging population and the 
inevitable rise in NCDs, the Thai government is engaging each element of our 
recommendations and grappling with the policy trade-offs in the context of 
broader economic and other strategic goals. The experience of Thailand in 
achieving its goal of population health is a case study of focus, perseverance, 
and consistent policy strategies.

BACKGROUND: Despite major advances in pharmacologic treatment, patients with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) still have a considerably reduced life 
expectancy. In this context, chronic hyperactivity of the neurohormonal axis has 
been shown to be detrimental in PAH, thus providing novel insights on the role 
of neurohormonal blockade as a potential therapeutic target.
AIM: To evaluate the application and prognostic effect of neurohormonal 
inhibitors (NEUi) in a single-center sample of patients with idiopathic PAH and 
risk factors for left heart disease.
METHODS: We analyzed data retrospectively collected from our register of right 
heart catheterizations performed consecutively from January 1, 2005 to October 
31, 2018. Patients on beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
angiotensin receptor blocker or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at the 
time of right heart catheterization were classified as NEUi users and compared 
to NEUi non-recipients.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 57 PAH subjects: 27 of those (47.4%) 
were taking at least one NEUi at the time of right heart catheterization and 
were compared with the remaining 36 NEUi non-recipients. NEUi users were older 
and had a higher cardiovascular risk profile compared to non-recipients. 
Additionally, NEUi non-users had a higher probability of dying during the course 
of follow-up than NEUi recipients (56.7% vs 25.9%, log-rank P = 0.020).
CONCLUSION: The above data highlighted a subgroup of patients with PAH and 
comorbidities for left heart disease in which NEUi use has shown to be 
associated with improved survival. Future prospective studies are needed to 
identify the most appropriate therapeutic strategies in this subset population.

It has previously been reported that differences in life expectancy can be 
linked to income. In Norway, a registry-based study that included all Norwegian 
residents aged ≥ 40 years (2005-2015) was performed. This study showed 
substantial and increasing gaps in life expectancy by income level during the 
interval between 2005-2015. Compared to the United States, the largest life 
expectancy differences were for individuals in the lower to middle part of the 
income distribution, although differences were observed at all income levels. 
Despite its undeniable strengths and although this paper can be considered as a 
significant contribution to this field, it has some shortcomings. The first 
shortcoming of this study is due to ignoring the effects of population exposures 
to natural and man-made ionizing and non-ionizing radiation on life expectancy. 
Another shortcoming arises from ignoring the strong impact of education on 
lifestyle. In summary, what is observed in this study might be at least to some 
extent, due to education-related changes in lifestyle and not necessarily income 
(despite the mutual links between education and income).

The current study investigates the impact of economic growth, carbon emission, 
temperature, and environmental technology on public health in GCC countries. 
Panel data from 1990 to 2020 is used, and the panel unit root test is used to 
check the stationarity of the data. After cointegration analysis, the ARDL 
estimation technique checks the long-run and short-run association between 
variables. The results have proved that economic growth enhances exposure to 
PM2.5 and mortality but helps in increasing life expectancy. Likewise, carbon 
emission also enhances exposure to PM2.5 and mortality but improves life 
expectancy. As far as temperature is concerned, although it increases the 
exposure to PM2.5, it also increases life expectancy. It is also found that 
environmental technology enhances exposure to PM2.5. For policy implication, the 
study reports that investment in research and development and modifications the 
energy mix are key measures to enhance the public health in GCC countries.

The importance of health is well documented in the development economics 
literature because of its increasing effects on economic growth in the long-run. 
Financial development and financial globalization are essential resources for 
health. This study examines the role of financial development and financial 
globalization in the rapid rise of life expectancy in China, India, and Japan by 
using the annual data covering the period of 1991-2019. The ARDL bounds testing 
approach confirm the long-run relationship between financial development, 
financial globalization, and life expectancy in the presence of GDP, health 
expenditure, and the internet. The long-run findings indicate that financial 
development positively affects life expectancy by 0.599% in China. The novel 
findings also indicate that financial globalization positively affects life 
expectancy by 1.247% in Japan and 1.121% in India. Our findings offer new 
empirical insights to policymakers crucial to improving life expectancy in 
China, India, and Japan.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic infection with herpes viruses is a potential contributing 
factor to the development of dementia. The introduction of nationwide shingles 
(varicella zoster) vaccination in Wales might therefore be associated with 
reduced incident dementia.
METHODS: We analyzed the association of shingles vaccination with incident 
dementia in Wales between 2013 and 2020 using retrospectively collected national 
health data.
RESULTS: Vaccinated individuals were at reduced risk of dementia (adjusted 
hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.69 to 0.75). The association was 
not modified by a reduction in shingles diagnosis and was stronger for vascular 
dementia than for Alzheimer's disease. Vaccination was also associated with a 
reduction in several other diseases and all-cause mortality.
DISCUSSION: Our study shows a clear association of shingles vaccination with 
reduced dementia, consistent with other observational cohort studies. The 
association may reflect selection bias with people choosing to be vaccinated 
having a higher healthy life expectancy.

Three-dimensional (3D) printers mainly create 3D objects by stacking thin layers 
of material. The effect of the tools created using the fused deposition modeling 
(FDM) 3D printer on nerve cells remains unclear. In this study, the effects of 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) models and two different types of polylactic acid 
(PLA) models (white or natural), were created using the FDM 3D printer on axon 
extension were compared using the Campenot chamber. Neurons were isolated from 
the dorsal root ganglia and added to the central compartment of the Campenot 
chambers after isolation, processing, and culturing. On day 7, after the 
initiation of the culture, the difference of the axon extensions to the side 
compartments of each group was confirmed. We also compared the pH and the amount 
of leakage when each of these chambers was used. The PLA was associated with a 
shorter axon extension than the PTFE (white p = 0.0078, natural p = 0.00391). No 
difference in the pH was observed (p = 0.347), but there was a significant 
difference on multiple group comparison (p = 0.0231) in the amount of leakage of 
the medium. PTFE was found to be a more suitable material for culturing 
attachments.

BACKGROUND: With an increase in the incidence and prevalence of non-rheumatic 
valvular heart diseases (NRVHDs), having a proper understanding of the disease 
current status in terms of quality of care and healthcare access can 
considerably affect further planning for the healthcare system.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the quality and 
equity of care concerning NRVHDs in terms of gender and sociodemographic index 
(SDI) using a newly proposed index.
METHODS: We obtained the primary measures (e.g. incidence) from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) data about NRVHD from 1990 to 2017 to calculate the 
subsequent secondary indices (e.g. mortality-to-incidence ratio) with close 
association to quality of care. Then, using principal component analysis (PCA), 
quality of care index (QCI) was calculated as a novel index from the secondary 
indices, rescaled to 0-100. QCI was calculated for all age groups and both 
genders, globally, regionally and nationally between 1990 and 2017.
RESULTS: Globally, the QCI for NRVHDs in 2017 was 87.3, and it appears that 
gender inequity was unremarkable (gender disparity ratio = 1.00, female QCI: 
90.2, male QCI: 89.7) in 2017 similar to the past three decades. Among WHO world 
regions, the Western Pacific Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region showed the 
highest (90.1) and lowest (74.0) QCI scores. Regarding SDI, the high-middle-SDI 
quintile with a QCI of 89.4 and the low-SDI quintile with a QCI of 77.8 were the 
two extremes of healthcare quality in 2017.
CONCLUSION: Although global status regarding the NRVHD's quality of care is 
acceptable, higher attention is required for lower SDI countries.

AIMS: Cost-effectiveness (CE) of lifestyle change programs (LCP) for type 2 
diabetes (T2D) prevention is influenced by a participant's risk. We identified 
the risk threshold of developing T2D in the intervention population that was 
cost-effective for three formats of the LCP: delivered in-person individually or 
in groups, or delivered virtually. We compared the cost-effectiveness across 
program formats when there were more than one cost-effective formats.
METHODS: Using the CDC-RTI T2D CE Simulation model, we estimated CEs associated 
with 3 program formats in 8 population groups with an annual T2D incidence of 1% 
to 8%. We generated a nationally representative simulation population for each 
risk level using the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
data. We used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 25-years, to measure the CEs of the 
programs. We took a health care system perspective.
RESULTS: To achieve an ICER of $50,000/QALY or lower, the annual T2D incidence 
of the program participant needed to be ≥5% for the in-person individual 
program, ≥4% for the digital individual program, and ≥3% for the in-person group 
program. For those with T2D risk of ≥4%, the in-person group program always 
dominated the digital individual program. The in-person individual program was 
cost-effective compared with the in-person group program only among persons with 
T2D risk of ≥8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could assist decision-makers in selecting the most 
appropriate target population for different formats of lifestyle intervention 
programs to prevent T2D.

Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Though one-size-fits-all age-based screening for colorectal 
cancer (CRC) is effective in reducing the incidence and mortality, the evidence 
regarding on personized screening based on individual risk factors has been 
growing. The study aimed to perform a systematic review to synthesize economic 
evidence of risk-tailored CRC screening strategies.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, 
Cochrane Library, Econlit, and National Institute for Health Research Economic 
Evaluation Database from inception to June 30, 2021. We calculated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost per life year or 
quality-adjusted life year gained for the risk-tailored screening compared with 
no screening or uniform screening. A strategy was cost-effective with less cost 
and equal or more effectiveness than the comparator along with lower ICER than 
the willingness-to-pay threshold.
RESULTS: Our review finally comprised seven studies. Five studies reported the
