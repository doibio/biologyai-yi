In spite of the progress in treatment strategies, cancer remains a major cause 
of death worldwide. Therefore, the main challenge should be the early diagnosis 
of cancer and the design of an optimal therapeutic strategy to increase the 
patient's life expectancy as well as the continuation of the search for 
increasingly active and selective molecules for the treatment of different forms 
of cancer. In the recent decades, research in the field of natural compounds has 
increasingly shifted towards advanced and molecular level understandings, thus 
leading to the development of potent anti-cancer agents. Among them is the 
diterpene lactone andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata 
(Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees that showed shows a plethora of biological activities, 
including not only anti-cancer activity, but also anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, 
anti-bacterial, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic, and 
immunomodulatory properties. Andrographolide has been shown to act as an 
anti-tumor drug by affecting specific molecular targets that play a part in the 
development and progression of several cancer types including breast, lung, 
colon, renal, and cervical cancer, as well as leukemia and hepatocarcinoma. This 
review comprehensively and systematically summarized the current research on the 
potential anti-cancer properties of andrographolide highlighting its mechanisms 
of action, pharmacokinetics, and potential side effects and discussing the 
future perspectives, challenges, and limitations of use.

INTRODUCTION: The life expectancy of Pompe disease patients has increased due to 
improved neonatal screening and enzyme replacement therapy. Nevertheless, the 
potential effect of frequent medical device exposure on pubertal development in 
these patients is not well understood, so further investigation is warranted.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the growth and puberty of 
nine Pompe disease patients. In addition, to determine the effects of frequent 
plastic medical device exposure in these patients, we measured urinary phthalate 
metabolites before and one day after enzyme replacement therapy.
RESULTS: Five out of nine patients (55%) with Pompe disease on enzyme 
replacement therapy had precocious puberty. Patients with precocious puberty had 
significantly shorter predicted adult heights compared to those with normal 
puberty (p = 0.014). The levels of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and 
mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) increased after enzyme 
replacement therapy, but the average levels of phthalate metabolites did not 
significantly differ between patients with normal and precocious puberty.
CONCLUSION: Pompe disease patients on enzyme replacement therapy tend to have 
precocious puberty, which may reduce their adult height. There are no 
significant differences in urinary phthalate metabolites between normal and 
precocious puberty patients. Regular follow-up of growth and puberty in Pompe 
disease patients is important to improve their health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the motivations and perceptions of the general public in 
the United Kingdom toward donating their uterus for Uterus Transplantation after 
death (UTx).
DESIGN: A cross sectional study.
SETTING: A 32-item electronic questionnaire.
POPULATION: One hundred fifty nine females over the age of 16 living in the 
United Kingdom, consented and took part in the study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The motivations and perceptions toward UTx among the 
general public including the willingness to donate and barriers preventing 
donation.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty nine women completed the questionnaire. The majority 
had never heard of UTx (n = 107, 71%) and most were not aware the uterus could 
be donated after death (n = 130, 92%). 43% of the cohort were willing to donate 
their uterus after death (n = 57). 8% stated they wished to donate their organs 
but not their uterus (n = 10). 30% of women (n = 42) believed the child born 
following UTx would have genetic links to the donor. Over half of the 
respondents (n = 65, 51%) strongly agreed or agreed they would feel joy in the 
knowledge that donation would lead to bringing a new life into the world. A 
quarter of respondents strongly agreed or agreed (n = 45, 25%) that the use of 
their uterus by another woman would feel like an extension of life.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a favorable opinion toward UTx and a positive 
attitude toward donation of the uterus after death among the general public in 
the United Kingdom. The findings also highlight the need for education around 
UTx now this therapeutic option is available.

Renal cell carcinoma represents 3% of solid tumors. In 4-10% of patients, venous 
tumor thrombosis is present, and 1% reaches the right atrium. Other tumors can 
be associated with tumor thrombosis. The natural history of venous tumor 
thrombosis implies a mean survival of 5 months. Between 2001 and 2021, 4 
patients underwent resection of tumor thrombi into the right atrium, requiring 
cardiopulmonary bypass. None of the patients died within 30 days 
postoperatively. Mean follow-up time was 30.9 months (2.4- 96.1). Two patients 
are still alive and two died due to disease progression. Died patient's 
follow-up was 7.5 and 17.4 months, surpassing life expectancy of those without 
surgery. We present a series of patients who underwent lumpectomy and IVC 
thrombectomy. IVC tumor thrombosis has an ominous prognosis, however surgical 
treatment has an important role by improving the survival of these patients. The 
multidisciplinary approach is necessary to obtain good postoperative results.

Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi, Romania.

Peri-implant fractures have gained increasing importance in orthopedics as the 
number of surgical procedures involving orthopedic implants rises globally. 
These fractures pose a significant challenge in terms of diagnosis, treatment, 
and postoperative management. They manifest as stress fractures distal to the 
implant site. Developing an effective treatment strategy involves evaluating 
multiple influencing factors. This article presents a rare case of a 
peri-implant distal radius fracture in a 63-year-old man, with no comorbidities, 
resulting from a car accident, classified as C1U in the Michele D'Arienzo 
system. The surgical intervention included plate fixation for the radius and 
wire fixation for the ulna. The wire was used for ulna instead of a plate, due 
to skin injuries, with good results. As life expectancy rises and individuals 
remain active in their elder years, the incidence of peri-implant fractures is 
expected to increase. Factors such as the implant type, surgeon's approach, and 
patient-specific elements may influence peri-implant fracture occurrence. The 
widespread use of plate fixation for distal radius fractures may also contribute 
to a parallel increase in such fractures. Providing detailed context and 
specific case presentation allows better understanding and implications for 
clinical practice.

University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.

The treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS represents one of the greatest 
challenges in medicine. While there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, truly remarkable 
progress has been made for treatment of HIV/AIDS patients today. The advent of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the mid-1990s dramatically improved 
HIV-1 related morbidity, greatly prolonged life expectancy, and delayed 
progression of AIDS. Due to current antiretroviral therapy, the mortality rate 
for HIV infected patients is closely approaching the mortality rate for the 
general population. The long-term success of HIV-AIDS treatment requires 
continued enhancement of cART with further development of novel drugs that would 
exhibit fewer side effects, higher genetic barrier to the development of 
resistance, and longer action with durable virologic suppression. This editorial 
article provides a quick review of four decades of intense drug development 
research efforts targeting various viral enzymes and cellular host factors 
leading to the evolution of today's treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection 
and AIDS. It also touches on challenges of future treatment options.

BACKGROUND: Long-term nursing home (NH) care helps NH residents with their daily 
activities and improves their quality of life, but negatively affects their 
independent physical activities and increases the risk of dangerous events. 
Dangerous events in the elderly usually occur in the conversion of walking 
periods when forward striding has already happened, but the body has not yet 
entered a completely steady walking.
OBJECTIVES: Compare the gait characteristics in Chinese long-term NH residents 
and community-living elderly during the walking Transitional Period (TP) and 
Stabilization Period (SP).
METHODS: 32 long-term NH residents and 33 age- and sex-matched community-living 
elderly were recruited. The 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30-s CST), Timed Up and 
Go Test (TUGT), and Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES) were used to assess 
their body function. The Xsens MVN BIOMECH system was used to collect and 
analyze the gait parameters of participants.
RESULTS: Compared to community-living elderly, NH residents had fewer numbers of 
30-s CST, took more time to complete TUGT, and lower MEFS scores. NH residents 
showed slower gait speed (P < 0.001), less peak hip flexion (P = 0.022) and 
extension (P = 0.003), knee internal rotation (P = 0.023), and ankle 
plantarflexion (P = 0.001) and internal rotation (P = 0.007) angles during 
walking. When walking progressed from TP to SP, NH residents showed increased 
ankle dorsiflexion (P < 0.001), decreased hip internal rotation (P < 0.001), and 
community-living elderly had increased hip extension (P = 0.005) angles.
CONCLUSIONS: Chinese long-term NH residents had reduced lower extremities 
strength and postural balance, and higher fear of falling compared to 
community-living elderly. Their walking performance also showed high fall risk. 
Besides, long-term NH residents adopted a distal strategy to propel the body 
forward, which may be a compensatory measure to compensate for inadequate 
proximal joint control from forward walking to stable walking, and long-term NH 
residents have reduced postural stability during this process.

Life Expectancy Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2019-2021: Highly 
Racialized Deaths in Young and Middle Adulthood Distinguish the United States 
Among High-Income Countries.

We estimate changes in life expectancy between 2019 and 2021 in the United 
States (total population and separately for five racial-ethnic groups) and 20 
high-income peer countries. For each country's total population, we decompose 
the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 changes in life expectancy by age. For U.S. 
populations, we also decompose the changes in life expectancy by age and 
COVID-19 deaths. U.S. life expectancy decreases in 2020 (1.86 years) and 2021 
(0.55 years) exceeded mean changes in peer countries (0.39-year decrease and 
0.23-year increase, respectively) and disproportionately involved COVID-19 
deaths in midlife. In 2020, Native, Hispanic, Black, and Asian American 
populations experienced larger decreases in life expectancy and greater losses 
in midlife than did the White population. In 2021, the White population 
experienced the largest decrease in U.S. life expectancy, although life 
expectancy in the Native American and Black populations remained much lower. 
U.S. losses during the pandemic were more severe than in peer countries and 
disproportionately involved young and middle-aged adults, especially adults of 
this age in racialized populations. The mortality consequences of the COVID-19 
pandemic deepened a U.S. disadvantage in longevity that has been growing for 
decades and exacerbated long-standing racial inequities in U.S. mortality.

In addition to fundamental mortality metrics such as mortality rates and 
mortality rate ratios, life expectancy is also commonly used to investigate 
excess mortality among a group of individuals diagnosed with specific diseases 
or conditions. However, as an average measure, life expectancy ignores the 
heterogeneity in lifespan. Interestingly, the variation in lifespan-a measure 
commonly used in the field of demography-has not been estimated for people with 
a specific condition. Based on recent advances in methodology in research within 
epidemiology and demography, we discuss two metrics, namely, the average life 
disparity and average lifetable entropy after diagnosis, which estimate the 
variation in lifespan for time-varying conditions in both absolute and relative 
aspects. These metrics are further decomposed into early and late components, 
separated by their threshold ages. We use mortality data for women with mental 
disorders from Danish registers to design a population-based study and measure 
such metrics. Compared with women from the general population, women with a 
mental disorder had a shorter average remaining life expectancy after diagnosis 
(37.6 years vs. 44.9 years). In addition, women with mental disorders also 
experienced a larger average lifespan variation, illustrated by larger average 
life disparity (9.5 years vs 9.1 years) and larger average lifetable entropy 
(0.33 vs 0.27). More specifically, we found that women with a mental disorder 
had a larger early average life disparity but a smaller late average life 
disparity. Unlike the average life disparity, both early and late average 
lifetable entropy were higher for women with mental disorders compared to the 
general population. In conclusion, the metric proposed in our study complements 
the current research focusing merely on life expectancy and further provides a 
new perspective into the assessment of people's health associated with 
time-varying conditions.

PURPOSE: To explore muscle properties, gross motor performance, and quality of 
life (QoL) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared with controls and 
to assess relationships among these outcomes.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 24 children assessed muscle properties 
including: knee extension strength by dynamometry; vastus lateralis (VL) and 
rectus femoris (RF) muscle thickness by ultrasonography; and VL and RF 
neuromuscular activation (rate of muscle activation [RoA]) by electromyography 
(EMG). Gross motor performance and QoL were assessed by standardized tests and 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: Children with SCD had impaired knee extension strength, VL EMG RoA, 
gross motor performance, and QoL compared with children without SCD. 
Relationships among muscle properties, gross motor performance, and QoL were 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that comprehensive muscle properties, gross 
motor performance, and QoL assessments should be considered to support and 
develop individualized physical therapy plans for children with SCD.

The role of palliative care is to recognize patients with advanced illnesses who 
are at risk for poor outcomes and to alleviate their pain and suffering. 
Patients with both kidney and liver disease are a very vulnerable population due 
to the unique pathophysiologic relationship these two organs share, which often 
leads to an abbreviated life expectancy and a significant symptom burden. These 
patients face many challenges in their care. This article discusses the 
importance of prognostication for early palliative care referrals as well as the 
management of the two most common complaints patients with kidney and liver 
disease face: pain and ascites.

INTRODUCTION: Certain clinical events reduce life expectancy and necessitate a 
reassessment of patient treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To describe medication changes in relation to a cancer diagnosis and 
the end of life and to highlight challenges and limitations with such 
descriptions.
METHODS: From a cohort with all Danish patients with type 2 diabetes, we matched 
patients with incident cancer during 2000-2021 (n = 41,745) with patients 
without cancer (n = 166,994) using propensity scores. We described their 
medication usage from cancer diagnosis until death.
RESULTS: The 1- and 5-year mortality were 51% and 86%, respectively, in the 
cancer group, and 13% and 59% in the non-cancer group. In relation to cancer 
diagnosis and death, the use of symptomatic medications (e.g., opioids, 
benzodiazepines) increased (10-60 incident medications per 100 patient-months), 
and the use of preventive medications (e.g., antihypertensives, statins) 
decreased (5-30% fewer users). The changes in relation to the diagnosis were 
driven by patients with short observed lengths of survival (< 2 years). In 
contrast, changes occurring within a year before death were less dependent on 
survival strata, and > 60% used preventive medications in their last months.
CONCLUSIONS: Medication changes in relation to a cancer diagnosis were frequent 
and correlated to the length of survival. The results showcase the challenges 
and limited clinical utility of anchoring analyses on events or death. While the 
former diluted the results by averaging changes across patients with vastly 
different clinical courses, the latter leveraged information unavailable to the 
treating clinicians. While medication changes were common near death, preventive 
medications were often used until death.

Comment in
    Pharmacoeconomics. 2023 Nov 2;:

The provision of informal (unpaid) care can impose significant 'spillover 
effects' on carers, and accounting for these effects is consistent with the 
efficiency and equity objectives of health technology assessment (HTA). 
Inclusion of these effects in health economic models, particularly carer 
health-related quality of life (QOL), can have a substantial impact on net 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains and the relative cost effectiveness of 
new technologies. Typically, consideration of spillover effects improves the 
value of a technology, but in some circumstances, consideration of spillover 
effects can lead to situations whereby life-extending treatments for patients 
may be considered cost ineffective due to their impact on carer QOL. In this 
piece we revisit the classic 'QALY trap' and introduce an analogous 'carer QALY 
trap' which may have practical implications for economic evaluations where the 
inclusion of carer QOL reduces incremental QALY gains. Such results may align 
with a strict QALY-maximisation rule, however we consider the extent to which 
this principle may be at odds with the preferences of carers themselves (and 
possibly society more broadly), potentially leading decision makers into the 
carer QALY trap as a result. We subsequently reflect on potential solutions, 
highlighting the important (albeit limited) role that deliberation has to play 
in HTA.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this article were to analyse the burden of NCDs and 
their RFs in the Mercosur countries between 1990 and 2019 and to project 
mortality trends for 2030.
STUDY DESIGN: Epidemiological study of time series.
METHODS: The present study used data from the Global Burden of Disease study. 
The absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, disability-adjusted life years, 
years of life lost, years lived with disability and the burden of premature 
mortality by NCD attributable to the RFs were evaluated. Projections were made 
up to 2030. Age-standardised rates were used to draw comparisons by years and by 
countries. The analysis was conducted using the RStudio software.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, a decrease was found in the premature mortality 
rates caused by NCDs in all the countries, except for Paraguay, which remained 
stable. When analysing premature mortality rates due to NCDs up to 2030, it was 
predicted that none of the countries would achieve the sustainable development 
goal of a one-third reduction in premature mortality by NCDs. Regarding the 
impacts of the RFs for NCDs, smoking, dietary risks, high blood pressure (BP) 
and high body mass index (BMI) were the main risks attributable to premature 
deaths due to NCDs.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that mortality rates are declining in Mercosur 
countries; however, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the 
sustainable development goal of a one-third reduction in mortality due to NCDs 
by 2030. In addition to access to adequate treatment, progress is required in 
public regulation actions to reduce RFs, such as smoking, dietary risks, high BP 
and high BMI.

OBJECTIVES: Stroke is a significant public health burden worldwide. This study 
aimed to explore the trends and patterns of stroke incidence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and case-fatality percent (CFP) worldwide 
from 1990 to 2019.
STUDY DESIGN: Age-period-cohort analysis.
METHODS: Trends in stroke burden worldwide were evaluated using data from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. In addition, the relationship between the 
burden of stroke and sociodemographic index (SDI) was examined by quantile 
regression. Age, period and cohort patterns in stroke burden across different 
SDI groups were estimated using age-period-cohort analysis.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, the age-standardised rates (ASRs) of stroke 
incidence, mortality and DALYs declined significantly worldwide, with decreases 
of -16.89% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: -18.41 to -15.29), -36.43% (95% 
UI: -41.65 to -31.20) and -35.23% (95% UI: -40.49 to -30.49), respectively. 
Regions with ASRs in the 75th percentile and below experienced significant 
decreases in ASRs with increasing SDI. After 2014, there was a stable or 
slightly increased period effect for stroke incidence in all groups, while 
mortality, DALYs and CFP increased only in the high SDI group. The cohort effect 
of stroke incidence remained constant in the high SDI group from the 1960-1964 
cohort onwards.
CONCLUSIONS: Although high SDI regions had a lower stroke burden and a faster 
overall decline in burden, the recent relative risk data suggest a potential 
deceleration in the progress of reducing stroke burden in these areas. There is 
a need for more active measures to reduce the stroke burden in areas with the 
highest incidence, mortality and DALYs, as increasing SDI alone cannot lower the 
burden in these regions.

Objective: To analyze the trend of disease burden of oral cancer attributable to 
smoking in China from 1990 to 2019, and predict the mortality trend of oral 
cancer from 2020 to 2034, providing scientific basis for formulating targeted 
oral cancer prevention and treatment strategy to achieve the goal of "Healthy 
China 2030". Methods: Using partial data on the global burden of disease in 
China in 2019, attributive death and disability adjusted life year (DALY) were 
used to describe. The trend of changes in the burden of oral cancer disease 
attributed to smoking was analyzed by using the Joinpoint regression model to 
estimate the annual average percentage change (AAPC) of age standardized 
mortality and DALY rates. Meanwhile, the Bayesian age-period- cohort model is 
used to predict oral cancer deaths and DALY trends attributed to smoking over 
the next 15 years. Results: The age-standardized mortality rate and DALY rate in 
China from 1990 to 2019 showed an overall upward trend, with an average annual 
increase of 1.49% (95%CI: 1.34%-1.65%, P<0.001) and 1.41% (95%CI: 1.24%-1.59%, 
P<0.001) respectively, higher than around the earth and in regions with 
different socio-demographic index (SDI). In 2019, 46.74% (10 584/22 642) of oral 
cancer deaths in China were attributed to smoking. Compared to 1990, the number 
of attributed deaths in 2019 increased by 293.75% (7 896/2 688), while DALY 
increased by 257.97% (189 039/73 280). Moreover, the growth rates of attributed 
deaths and DALY in males [304.95% (7 584/2 487) and 265.60% (183 349/69 033), 
respectively] were significantly higher than those in females [154.73% (311/201) 
and 133.95% (5 690/4 248), respectively] (P<0.001). The age group results showed 
that the proportion of deaths and DALY gradually transitioned towards the 
elderly (>60 years old). The expected number of deaths would increase from 10 
731 in 2020 to 14 125 in 2034, with a rise of 31.63% (3 394/10 731). 
Simultaneously, DALY would increase from 267 064 person years in 2020 to 326 634 
person years in 2034, with a rise of 22.31% (59 570/267 064). Conclusions: From 
1990 to 2019, the burden of oral cancer diseases attributed to smoking in China 
showed an increasing trend, with a higher growth rates than in the global and 
different SDI regions. There were differences in gender and age, and the burden 
of oral cancer diseases attributed to smoking in China would continue to 
increase in the next 15 years. It is necessary to educate on the adverse effects 
of tobacco consumption and to conduct vigilant oral self-examination among 
high-risk groups to help early detection and intervention at the same time.

通过分析1990—2019年我国归因于吸烟的口腔癌疾病负担变化趋势，为制订针对性的口腔癌防治策略和实现“健康中国2030”目标提供科学依据。 方法： 
利用2019年全球疾病负担中国部分数据，采用归因死亡和伤残调整生命年（disability adjusted life 
year，DALY）进行描述。以世界人口为标准，使用Joinpoint回归模型估计年龄标化死亡率和年龄标化DALY率的平均年度百分比变化率，分析归因于吸烟的口腔癌疾病负担变化趋势。同时，基于贝叶斯年龄-时期-队列模型预测2020—2034年归因于吸烟的口腔癌死亡和DALY趋势。 
结果： 
1990—2019年我国年龄标化死亡率和DALY率整体呈上升趋势，平均每年分别上升1.49%（95%CI：1.34%~1.65%，P<0.001）和1.41%（95%CI：1.24%~1.59%，P<0.001），且高于全球及不同社会人口学指数（socio-demographic 
index，SDI）地区。2019年我国有46.74%（10 584/22 
642）的口腔癌死亡归因于吸烟，与1990年相比，2019年归因死亡人数增长了293.75%（7 896/2 688），DALY增长了257.97%（189 
039/73 280），且男性归因死亡人数增长率和DALY增长率［分别为304.95%（7 584/2 487）和265.60%（183 349/69 
033）］均显著高于女性［分别为154.73%（311/201）和133.95%（5 690/4 
248）］（P<0.001）。年龄分组结果显示，归因死亡人数和DALY占比逐渐向老年人（>60岁）过渡。预计死亡人数将从2020年的10 
731人上升至2034年的14 125人，增长31.63%（3 394/10 731）；DALY将从2020年的267 064人年上升至2034年的326 
634人年，增长22.31%（59 570/267 064）。 结论： 
1990—2019年我国归因于吸烟的口腔癌疾病负担呈升高趋势，且涨幅高于全球及不同SDI地区，不同性别、年龄间归因于吸烟的口腔癌疾病负担存在差异；2020—2034年我国归因于吸烟的口腔癌疾病负担将持续加重，有必要加强烟草消费行为的宣传教育，同时应加强高危人群的口腔自我检查，助力口腔癌的早发现早干预。.

BACKGROUND: Research guides evidence-based general surgery practice, advocacy, 
policy and resource allocation, but is seemingly lacking representation from 
those countries with greatest disease burden and mortality. Accordingly, we 
conducted a geographic study of publications in the most impactful general 
surgery journals worldwide.
METHODS: The six general surgery journals with the highest 2020 impact factors 
were selected. Only journals specific to general surgery were included. For all 
original articles over the past five years, the affiliated country and city were 
extracted for the first, second and last author. Number of publications were 
adjusted per capita, and compared to Human Development Index (HDI) using 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: 8274 original articles were published in the top six ranked general 
surgery journals over 2016-2020, with 24,332 affiliated authors. Authors were 
most commonly associated with the US (27.88%), Japan (9.09%) and China (8.46%), 
or per capita, The Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore. There is a linear 
association between publishing in a top six journal and HDI of country of 
affiliation. Just four publications were from medium or low HDI countries over 
the period.
CONCLUSION: Authorship in leading general surgery journals is predominantly from 
wealthy, Western countries. Authorship is associated with affiliation with a 
high HDI country, with few authors from medium or low HDI countries. There is a 
lack of representation in literature from Africa, Russia, and parts of Southeast 
Asia, and thus a lack of locally relevant evidence to guide surgical practice in 
these areas of high disease burden and low life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Analyze scientific literature on qualitative research that studies 
the medication experience-MedExp-and related pharmaceutical interventions that 
bring changes in patients' health. Through the content analysis of this scoping 
review, we intend to: (1) understand how pharmacists analyze the MedExp of their 
patients who receive Comprehensive Medication Management CMM and (2) explain 
which categories they establish and how they explain the individual, 
psychological, and cultural dimensions of MedExp.
METHODS: The scoping review followed recommendations from PRISMA Extension for 
Scoping Reviews. Medline (Pubmed), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Psycinfo were 
used to identify research on MedExp from patients attended by pharmacists; and 
that they comply with quality standards, Standards for Reporting Qualitative 
Research. Articles published in English and Spanish were included.
RESULTS: 395 qualitative investigations were identified, 344 were excluded. In 
total, 19 investigations met the inclusion criteria. Agreement between 
reviewers, kappa index 0.923, 95% CI (0.836-1.010). The units of analysis of the 
patients' speeches were related to how they were progressing in their 
medications and how it was built through MedExp, the influence it has on the 
experience of becoming ill, the connection with socioeconomic aspects, and 
beliefs. Based on MedExp, the pharmacists raised cultural proposals, support 
networks, health policies, and provide education and information about 
medication and disease. Additionally, characteristics of the interventions were 
identified, such as a dialogic model, therapeutic relationship, shared 
decision-making, comprehensive approach, and referrals to other professionals.
CONCLUSIONS: The MedExp is an extensive concept, which encompasses people's life 
experience who use medications based on their individual, psychological, and 
social qualities. This MedExp is corporal, intentional, intersubjective, and 
relational, expanding to the collective because it implies beliefs, culture, 
ethics, and the socioeconomic and political reality of each person located in 
their context.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal cancer arising in the bile ducts within and 
just outside the liver. It occurs worldwide and falls into two etiologically 
defined groups, one related to chronic liver fluke infection and the other 
not. Liver fluke-related CCA is found in continental Southeast Asia (caused by 
Opisthorchis viverrini with infection leading to opisthorchiasis), East Asia 
(Clonorchis sinensis), and Eastern Europe and Russia (Opisthorchis felineus). 
Both O. viverrini and C. sinensis are classified as group one carcinogens, while 
recent data from O. felineus suggest the same. In Southeast Asia, an estimated 
67.3 million people are at risk of O. viverrini infection and subsequently 
developing CCA. When the three liver fluke species are considered, an estimated 
700 million people are at risk of infection and developing CCA globally. The 
northeast of Thailand (Isan) is the world's hot spot of liver fluke infection 
and CCA. Early detection, diagnosis, and surgical intervention/curative 
treatment of CCA are critical to increase life expectancy and quality of life of 
people in the region and globally. Despite concentrated recent efforts focusing 
on a multidisciplinary approach to understand the ecology, epidemiology, 
biology, public health, and social significance of infection by cancer causing 
liver flukes, it remains an underestimated and under-resourced public health 
problem. In addition, it is still believed to be a regional problem without 
global significance-this is not the case. This book focuses on O. viverrini as 
the main causative agent of CCA in Southeast Asia, but many aspects detailed in 
the following chapters also relate to the two other liver fluke species. Our aim 
is to produce a holistic framework including the basic biology of O. viverrini 
and its relation to the epidemiology of the disease through diagnosis to 
treatment, including palliative methods, pathology, and control.
