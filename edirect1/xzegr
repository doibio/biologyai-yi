Physiological changes associated with aging increase the risk for the 
development of age-related diseases. This increase is non-specific to the type 
of age-related disease, although each disease develops through a unique 
pathophysiologic mechanism. People who age at a faster rate develop age-related 
diseases earlier in their life. They have an older "biological age" compared to 
their "chronological age". Early detection of individuals with accelerated aging 
would allow timely intervention to postpone the onset of age-related diseases. 
This would increase their life expectancy and their length of good quality life. 
The goal of this study was to investigate whether retinal microvascular 
complexity could be used as a biomarker of biological age. Retinal images of 68 
participants ages ranging from 19 to 82 years were collected in an observational 
cross-sectional study. Twenty of the old participants had age-related diseases 
such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and/or Alzheimer's dementia. The rest of 
the participants were healthy. Retinal images were captured by a hand-held, 
non-mydriatic fundus camera and quantification of the microvascular complexity 
was performed by using Sholl's, box-counting fractal, and lacunarity analysis. 
In the healthy subjects, increasing chronological age was associated with lower 
retinal microvascular complexity measured by Sholl's analysis. Decreased 
box-counting fractal dimension was present in old patients, and this decrease 
was 2.1 times faster in participants who had age-related diseases (p = 0.047). 
Retinal microvascular complexity could be a promising new biomarker of 
biological age. The data from this study is the first of this kind collected in 
Montenegro. It is freely available for use.

BACKGROUND: Addressing the increasing prevalence of obesity is a global public 
health priority. Severe obesity (body mass index > 40) reduces life expectancy, 
due to its association with people developing complications (e.g. diabetes, 
cancer, cardiovascular disease), and greatly impairs quality of life. The 
National Health Service (NHS) in the UK provides specialist weight management 
services (SWMS) for people with severe obesity, but key uncertainties remain 
around patient access to and engagement with weight management services, as well 
as pathways beyond the service.
METHODS: In this multiple methods study, using online forum data and 
semi-structured interviews, stakeholders' experiences of delivering and 
receiving SWMS were explored. Using the web search engine Google with keywords 
and web address (URL) identifiers, relevant public online platforms were sourced 
with snowball sampling and search strings used to identify threads related to 
people's experiences of accessing SWMS (n = 57). Interviews were conducted with 
24 participants (nine patients, 15 staff), and data from all sources were 
analysed thematically using the framework approach.
RESULTS: Six themes related to access to and engagement with SWMS emerged during 
data analysis: (1) making the first move, (2) uncertainty and confusion, (3) 
resource issues, (4) respect and understanding, (5) mode of delivery, and (6) 
desire for ongoing support.
CONCLUSION: There is a mixed and varied picture of SWMS provision across the UK. 
The service offered is based on local clinical decision making and available 
resources, resulting in a range of patient experiences and perspectives. Whilst 
service capacity issues and patient anxiety were seen as barriers to accessing 
care, peer support and positive clinical and group interactions (connectedness 
between individuals) were considered to increase engagement.

Recommendations for clinical practice Nice/Saint-Paul-de-Vence 2022-2023 : 
Management of advanced/relapsing endometrial cancer Since the first 
recommendations in 2020 concerning metastatic and/or relapsed endometrial 
cancer, new treatment options have shown a benefit on patients' life expectancy, 
justifying their update. In first line, the choice will be made between 
chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel or hormone therapy with progestin, 
depending on tumor characteristics (histological type, grade, expression of 
hormone receptors, rate of progression). In case of a dMMR tumors, the use of 
immunotherapy within the framework of a therapeutic trial is an option. Beyond 
first-line chemotherapy, current standard treatment consists of the combination 
of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib, regardless of MMR status. Close clinical and 
biological monitoring is however necessary given the potential toxicity. 
Chemotherapy retains its place either as monotherapy (paclitaxel or doxorubicin) 
in the event of failure or contraindication to pembrolizumab-lenvatinib, or in 
combination with carboplatin in the event of a long free interval and pMMR 
tumor. The numerous ongoing clinical trials evaluating new therapeutic targets 
or strategies adapted to molecular or histological types should allow further 
improvements the prognosis of patients with metastatic endometrial cancer.

BACKGROUND: Kinematic and mechanical alignment outcomes in total knee 
arthroplasty remain controversial. This study compared the clinical and 
radiological outcomes of total knee arthroplasty using kinematic and mechanical 
alignments.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane 
Library databases for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies published 
before November 2022. The data of interest were extracted and analyzed using 
Review Manager V.5.4.
RESULTS: Nineteen randomized controlled trials and cohort studies involving 880 
kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasties and 965 mechanical alignment total 
knee arthroplasties were included. In this meta-analysis, the kinematic 
alignment group achieved better knee joint function scores, including the Oxford 
Knee Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Knee Society 
Score, and better flexion angles. No statistical differences were detected in 
the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, extension 
angle, Forgotten Joint Score, European Quality of Life five-dimension measure, 
hip-knee-ankle angle, or complications between the kinematic and mechanical 
alignment groups.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that kinematic alignment total knee 
arthroplasty provides clinical benefits in terms of the Oxford Knee Score, Knee 
Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Knee Society Score (knee), Knee Society 
Score (function), and better flexion angles. In addition, kinematic alignment 
total knee arthroplasty led to similar clinical outcomes as mechanical alignment 
total knee arthroplasty without increasing complications.

Methyltransferase-like 8 (METTL8) encodes a mitochondria-localized METTL8-Iso1 
and a nucleolus-distributed METTL8-Iso4 isoform, which differ only in their 
N-terminal extension (N-extension), by mRNA alternative splicing. METTL8-Iso1 
generates 3-methylcytidine at position 32 (m3C32) of mitochondrial tRNAThr and 
tRNASer(UCN). Whether METTL8-Iso4 is an active m3C32 methyltransferase and the 
role of the N-extension in mitochondrial tRNA m3C32 formation remain unclear. 
Here, we revealed that METTL8-Iso4 was inactive in m3C32 generation due to the 
lack of N-extension, which contains several absolutely conserved 
modification-critical residues; the counterparts were likewise essential in 
cytoplasmic m3C32 biogenesis by methyltransferase-like 2A (METTL2A) or budding 
yeasts tRNA N3-methylcytidine methyltransferase (Trm140), in vitro and in vivo. 
Cross-compartment/species tRNA modification assays unexpectedly found that 
METTL8-Iso1 efficiently introduced m3C32 to several cytoplasmic or even 
bacterial tRNAs in vitro. m3C32 did not influence 
tRNAThrN6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification or aminoacylation. In 
addition to its interaction with mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS2), we 
further discovered an interaction between mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase 
(TARS2) and METTL8-Iso1. METTL8-Iso1 substantially stimulated the aminoacylation 
activities of SARS2 and TARS2 in vitro, suggesting a functional connection 
between mitochondrial tRNA modification and charging. Altogether, our results 
deepen the mechanistic insights into mitochondrial m3C32 biogenesis and provide 
a valuable route to prepare cytoplasmic/bacterial tRNAs with only a m3C32 
moiety, aiding in future efforts to investigate its effects on tRNA structure 
and function.

BACKGROUND: The incapacity to store lipids in adipose tissue in Congenital 
Generalized Lipodystrophy (CGL) causes hypoleptinemia, increased appetite, 
ectopic fat deposition and lipotoxicity. CGL patients experience shortened life 
expectancy. The plasma lipidomic profile has not been characterized fully in 
CGL, nor has the extent of dietary intake in its modulation. The present work 
investigated the plasma lipidomic profile of CGL patients in comparison to 
eutrophic individuals at the fasted state and after a breakfast meal.
METHOD: Blood samples from 11 CGL patients and 10 eutrophic controls were 
collected after 12 h fasting (T0) and 90 min after an ad libitum fat-containing 
breakfast (T90). The lipidomic profile of extracted plasma lipids was 
characterized by non-target liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Important differences between groups were observed at T0 and at T90. 
Several molecular species of fatty acyls, glycerolipids, sphingolipids and 
glycerophospholipids were altered in CGL. All the detected fatty acyl molecular 
species, several diacylglycerols and one triacylglycerol species were 
upregulated in CGL. Among sphingolipids, one sphingomyelin and one 
glycosphingolipid species showed downregulation in CGL. Alterations in the 
glycerophospholipids glycerophosphoethanolamines, glycerophosphoserines and 
cardiolipins were more complex. Interestingly, when comparing T90 versus T0, the 
lipidomic profile in CGL did not change as intensely as it did for control 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found profound alterations in the plasma 
lipidomic profile of complex lipids in CGL patients as compared to control 
subjects. A fat-containing breakfast meal did not appear to significantly 
influence the CGL profile observed in the fasted state. Our study may have 
implications for clinical practice, also aiding to a deeper comprehension of the 
role of complex lipids in CGL in view of novel therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Previous estimates of the impact of public health interventions 
targeting hypertension usually focus on one health outcome. This study aims to 
consider the effects of change in future hypertension prevalence on mortality, 
dementia, and disability simultaneously.
METHODS: We modelled three plausible scenarios based on observed trends of 
hypertension prevalence from 2003 to 2017 in England: observed trends continue 
(baseline scenario); 2017 prevalence remains unchanged; and 2017 prevalence 
decreases by 50% by 2060. We used a probabilistic Markov model to integrate 
calendar trends in incidence of cardiovascular disease, dementia, disability, 
and mortality to forecast their future occurrence in the population of England 
and Wales. Assuming the hypertension prevalence trend modifies health transition 
probabilities, we compared mortality outcomes and the burden of dementia and 
disability to 2060 for the scenarios.
FINDINGS: If the decline in hypertension prevalence stops, there would be a 
slight increase in the number of additional deaths to 2060 (22·9 [95% 
uncertainty interval 19·0-26·6] more deaths per 100 000 population), although 
the burdens of disability and dementia in absolute terms would change little. 
Alternatively, if the downward hypertension prevalence trend accelerates (with 
prevalence falling by 50% between 2017 and 2060), there would be a modest 
additional reduction in deaths (57·0 [50·4-63·5] fewer deaths per 100 000 
population), a small increase in dementia burden (9·0 [5·1-13·2] more cases per 
100 000 population), no significant effect on disability burden, and an 8% gain 
in healthy life expectancy at age 65 years from 2020 to 2060 (5·3 years vs 4·9 
years) compared with the baseline scenario.
INTERPRETATION: The major future impact of alternative hypertension prevention 
strategies appears to be on future life expectancy. The salutary effect of lower 
population blood pressure distribution on incidence of dementia and disability 
might not offset expansion of the susceptible population due to reduced 
mortality.

Amplification and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are affected by 
the position and type of primer-template mismatches (MMs) as well as various 
conditions of reaction. In this study, multiple linear regression (MLR) models 
and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed for the prediction of 
the effects of primer-template mismatches on the primer extension efficiency in 
primer-template duplex. In MLR models, the independent variable Pi representing 
the position effect of i-th mismatch from 3' end of primers was normalized to 
values between 0 and 1 according to the size of ΔΔGi, the difference of Gibbs 
free energy changes between the mismatch and its corresponding perfect-match, 
and other independent variables Pj representing the position effect of the j-th 
perfect-match from 3' end of primer were coded 1. A dependent variable of MLR 
model was relative extension efficiencies of primers. In ANN models, an input 
layer has neurons equal to the number of independent variables of corresponding 
MLR models and a hidden layer and an output layer have four and one neurons, 
respectively. Our MLR models and ANN models outperform the previous polynomial 
regression model for the prediction of the single base extension (SBE) 
efficiencies of single-MM primers. Especially, ANN model 6 which has 32 neurons 
representing the position effect of mismatch, the type of mismatch and the 
annealing temperature on primer-template duplex in the input layer can predict 
the SBE efficiencies of single-MM primers with a high accuracy, since its 
correlation coefficients R in training set, testing set and all data are 0.9870, 
0.9782 and 0.9857, respectively. These results will have a good prospect 
applicable to the design of primer and testing the primer specificity in genome 
database.

AIMS: More effort and actions are needed to combat the rising levels of food 
insecurity and poverty in developing countries, particularly among rural 
households. Rural households can significantly contribute to reducing poverty, 
enhancing their nutritional condition, and enhancing their standard of living by 
engaging in rabbit production but there are few empirical studies on the 
contribution of rabbit production to households' livelihood and income. 
Therefore, this study examines how producing rabbits affects rural farmers' 
income and household livelihood in Nigeria.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Multiple regression and descriptive statistics were used to 
analyze the data gathered from 240 rabbit farms. The findings demonstrated that 
rabbit farming is a male-dominated enterprise (male 77.5%). According to the 
regression analysis, the income of rural households was positively and 
significantly impacted by the income from rabbits. Farmers' ages, interactions 
with extension agents, credit they accessed, and assets were further 
determinants of their income. Additionally, rabbit production improved the level 
of living of rural households. Access to forage, the prevalence of diseases, 
scarcity of veterinary, and the high cost of medication, were the severe 
constraints faced in rabbit production.
CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that rabbit production had a significant 
contribution to the economic situation, way of life, and well-being of rural 
households. Although there were some constraints with the operation. Females are 
to be encouraged in rabbit production as livelihood diversification. Also, it is 
crucial that banks, governments, and non-governmental organizations offer 
farmers easily accessible and reasonable loan facilities as this will boost 
their revenue. Training on forage production and storage is also recommended.
SIGNIFICANCE AND THE IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Participation will be improved by 
having an understanding of how rabbit farming affects the income and way of life 
of rural dwellers. As a result, the findings of this study would enable 
policymakers to intervene in enhancing its production thereby encouraging more 
farmers to be involved in the production and also, enhancing the well-being of 
rural households.

INTRODUCTION: Decompressive craniectomy is a well described treatment to salvage 
life in large middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarcts. The size of the 
craniectomy is limited by the size of the skin incision and very large 
craniectomies need large skin flaps that are prone to necrosis at the wound 
margins.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe two modifications in the skin flap that we 
have used in 7 patients to achieve very large bony decompressions in malignant 
MCA infarctions without compromising on flap vascularity. One consists of a 
linear extension posteriorly from the question mark or reverse question mark 
incision while the other is an "n" shaped incision.
RESULTS: With these modifications we achieved craniectomies of size 15.6-17.8 cm 
in the anteroposterior and 10.7-12 cm in vertical axis of the bone flap removed 
in our patients. There were no additional procedural or wound related 
complications in a 6-month follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: Removal of a standard size bone flap may achieve suboptimal 
decompression in cases of large MCA territory infarctions. Imaginative tailoring 
of skin flaps helps to remove larger volumes of skull with no added procedural 
morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Tp53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. Canonical Tp53 DNA 
damage response pathways are well characterized and classically thought to 
underlie the tumor suppressive effect of Tp53. Challenging this dogma, mouse 
models have revealed that p53 driven apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are 
dispensable for tumor suppression. Here, we investigated the inverse context of 
a p53 mutation predicted to drive expression of canonical targets, but is 
detected in human cancer.
METHODS: We established a novel mouse model with a single base pair mutation 
(GAG>GAC, p53E221D) in the DNA-Binding domain that has wild-type function in 
screening assays, but is paradoxically found in human cancer in Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome. Using mouse p53E221D and the analogous human p53E224D mutant, we 
evaluated expression, transcriptional activation, and tumor suppression in vitro 
and in vivo.
RESULTS: Expression of human p53E224D from cDNA translated to a fully functional 
p53 protein. However, p53E221D/E221D RNA transcribed from the endogenous locus 
is mis-spliced resulting in nonsense mediated decay. Moreover, fibroblasts 
derived from p53E221D/E221D mice do not express a detectable protein product. 
Mice homozygous for p53E221D exhibited increased tumor penetrance and decreased 
life expectancy compared to p53 WT animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Mouse p53E221D and human p53E224D mutations lead to splice 
variation and a biologically relevant p53 loss of function in vitro and in vivo.

BACKGROUND: To determine if low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation targeting the primary motor cortex contralateral (M1CL) to the 
affected corticospinal tract in patients with hemiparetic stroke augments 
intensive training-related clinical improvement; an extension of the NICHE trial 
(Navigated Inhibitory rTMS to Contralesional Hemisphere Trial) using an 
alternative sham coil.
METHODS: The present E-FIT trial (Electric Field Navigated 1Hz rTMS for 
Post-stroke Motor Recovery Trial) included 5 of 12 NICHE trial outpatient US 
rehabilitation centers. The stimulation protocol remained identical (1 Hz 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, M1CL, preceding 60-minute therapy, 
18 sessions/6 wks; parallel arm randomized clinical trial). The sham coil 
appearance mimicked the active coil but without the weak electric field in the 
NICHE trial sham coil. Outcomes measured 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after 
the end of treatment included the following: upper extremity Fugl-Meyer 
(primary, 6 months after end of treatment), Action Research Arm Test, National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, quality of life (EQ-5D), and safety.
RESULTS: Of 60 participants randomized, 58 completed treatment and were included 
for analysis. Bayesian analysis of combined data from the E-FIT and the NICHE 
trials indicated that active treatment was not superior to sham at the primary 
end point (posterior mean odds ratio of 1.94 [96% credible interval of 
0.61-4.80]). For the E-FIT intent-to-treat population, upper extremity 
Fugl-Meyer improvement ≥5 pts occurred in 60% (18/30) active group and 50% 
(14/28) sham group. Participants enrolled 3 to 6 months following stroke had a 
67% (31%-91% CI) response rate in the active group at the 6-month end point 
versus 50% in the sham group (21.5%-78.5% CI). There were significant 
improvements from baseline to 6 months for both active and sham groups in upper 
extremity Fugl-Meyer, Action Research Arm Test, and EQ-5D (P<0.05). Improvement 
in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was observed only in the active 
group (P=0.004). Ten serious unrelated adverse events occurred (4 active group, 
6 sham group, P=0.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive motor rehabilitation 3 to 12 months after stroke improved 
clinical impairment, function, and quality of life; however, 1 Hz-repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation was not an effective treatment adjuvant in the 
present sample population with mixed lesion location and extent.

AIMS: Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome commonly categorized into two 
main phenotypes [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below or above 40%], 
and although empagliflozin is the first approved medication with proven clinical 
effectiveness for both phenotypes, its cost-effectiveness of treating the entire 
HF population remains unknown.
METHODS: The analysis was performed utilizing two preexisting, LVEF 
phenotype-specific cost-effectiveness models to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of empagliflozin in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic HF, 
irrespective of ejection fraction (EF). The results of the phenotype-specific 
models were combined using a population-weighted approach to estimate the 
deterministic and probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Based on combined results, empagliflozin + standard of care (SoC) is 
associated with 6.13 life-years (LYs) and 3.92 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) compared with 5.98 LYs and 3.76 QALYs for SoC alone over a lifetime, 
resulting in an incremental difference of 0.15 LYs and 0.16 QALYs, respectively. 
Total lifetime healthcare costs per patient are £15 246 for empagliflozin + SoC 
and £13 982 for SoC giving an incremental difference of £1264. The ICER is 
£7757/QALY, which is substantially lower than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 
£30 000 per QALY used by NICE. The results of the probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses are in line with the deterministic results.
CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin is the first efficacious, approved, and cost-effective 
treatment option for all HF patients, irrespective of EF. The combined ICER was 
consistently below the WTP threshold. Therefore, empagliflozin offers value for 
money for the treatment of the full HF population in England.

Neglecting possible growth heterogeneity and focusing only on the overall 
pattern of prostate cancer mortality rates can result in misunderstandings and 
incorrect conclusions about the growth process of the outcome. The main goal of 
this study was to capture the heterogeneity of prostate cancer mortality rates 
among countries from 1990 to 2019. To accomplish this aim, we performed the 
Bayesian latent Growth Mixture Model (GMM). In this longitudinal study, Prostate 
cancer mortality rates data from 1990 to 2019, as well as the Human Development 
Index (HDI), the Gross National Income (GNI), and the Life Expectancy at Birth 
(LEB), were obtained from WHO and UNDP platforms. The Bayesian GMM was used to 
discover homogeneous subgroups and estimate the pattern of prostate cancer 
mortality rates in each subgroup. The HDI, GNI and life expectancy effects were 
estimated using a Bayesian conditional Latent Growth Model (LGM). Globally, the 
intercept and the slope of the Bayesian LGM were equal to 8.77 and 0.19, 
respectively. The Bayesian GMM classified the 109 countries into four groups, 
which had significant positive growth patterns with different slopes except for 
the first class. The effect of HDI was not significant on the overall prostate 
cancer death rates, but GNI and LEB had a significantly positive effect on the 
model's intercepts and a significantly negative effect on the slope. Although 
the prostate cancer mortality rate increased globally, it has four distinct 
latent subgroups with various patterns. Additionally, the effects of HDI, GNI, 
and LEB on prostate cancer mortality rates varied significantly among the four 
subgroups, indicating a need for further investigation to identify causal 
factors.

BACKGROUND: In 2019, about 58 million individuals were chronically infected with 
hepatitis C virus. Some experts have proposed challenge trials for hepatitis C 
virus vaccine development.
METHODS: We modeled incremental infections averted through a challenge approach, 
under varying assumptions regarding trial duration, number of candidates, and 
vaccine uptake. We computed the benefit-risk ratio of incremental benefits to 
risks for challenge versus traditional approaches. We also benchmarked against 
monetary costs of achieving incremental benefits through treatment.
RESULTS: Our base case assumes 3 vaccine candidates, each with an 11% chance of 
success, corresponding to a 30% probability of successfully developing a 
vaccine. Given this probability, and assuming a 5-year difference in duration 
between challenge and traditional trials, a challenge approach would avert an 
expected 185 000 incremental infections with 20% steady-state uptake compared to 
a traditional approach and 832 000 with 90% uptake (quality-adjusted life-year 
benefit-risk ratio, 72 000 & 323 000). It would cost at least $92 million and 
$416 million, respectively, to obtain equivalent benefits through treatment. 
BRRs vary considerably across scenarios, depending on input assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Benefits of a challenge approach increase with more vaccine 
candidates, faster challenge trials, and greater uptake.

BACKGROUND: Circular economy (CE) has raised great interest as a concept and as 
a development model worldwide. This concept aims to provide a substitute for the 
linear economic model, which was based on production and consumption, continuous 
growth, and resources depletion. CE allows a greener economy with sustainable 
development and promotes more balanced societies. The healthcare sector is a 
major contributor to the climate crisis, with a carbon footprint representing 
4.4% of global net emissions. It is thus essential to rethink the applicability 
of CE in healthcare.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review guided by the Arksey and O'Malley 
methodological framework and utilised PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. A 
systematic search from MEDLINE complete, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases 
published between 1992 and 2022.
RESULTS: Through database searching a total of 1018 records were identified and 
475 duplicates were removed. From the total search, 543 articles were screened 
by title/abstract according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After 
screening, 38 full-text articles were selected and assessed for eligibility. 
Forty-seven additional records were also identified through other sources and 
screened for eligibility. Other sources included: 12 articles from snowballing 
of previous papers; 9 articles following peer-reviewers suggestions; 19 reports 
from relevant organisations in CE and healthcare; two webpage, and one book.
CONCLUSION: Specific areas were identified where hospitals could reduce their 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consequently their negative environmental 
impact, namely through waste management, energy, water, transportation/travel, 
hospital design, food optimisation, green procurement, and behaviour. Also, lack 
of staff awareness and knowledge of the environmental impact of healthcare, and 
hospitals sustainability were identified as major contributors.
