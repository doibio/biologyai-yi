IMPORTANCE: People with Down syndrome have a high risk of developing Alzheimer 
disease dementia. However, penetrance and age at onset are considered variable, 
and the association of this disease with life expectancy remains unclear because 
of underreporting in death certificates.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the variability in symptom onset of Alzheimer 
disease in Down syndrome is similar to autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease and 
to assess its association with mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study combines a meta-analysis with the 
assessment of mortality data from US death certificates (n = 77 347 case records 
with a International Classification of Diseases code for Down syndrome between 
1968 to 2019; 37 900 [49%] female) and from a longitudinal cohort study (n = 889 
individuals; 46% female; 3.2 [2.1] years of follow-up) from the Down Alzheimer 
Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative (DABNI).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the age 
at onset, age at death, and duration of Alzheimer disease dementia in Down 
syndrome. PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched for 
research reports, and OpenGray was used for gray literature. Studies with data 
about the age at onset or diagnosis, age at death, and disease duration were 
included. Pooled estimates with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using 
random-effects meta-analysis. The variability in disease onset was compared with 
that of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease. Based on these estimates, a 
hypothetical distribution of age at death was constructed, assuming fully 
penetrant Alzheimer disease. These results were compared with real-world 
mortality data.
RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, the estimate of age at onset was 53.8 years (95% 
CI, 53.1-54.5 years; n = 2695); the estimate of age at death, 58.4 years (95% 
CI, 57.2-59.7 years; n = 324); and the estimate of disease duration, 4.6 years 
(95% CI, 3.7-5.5 years; n = 226). Coefficients of variation and 95% prediction 
intervals of age at onset were comparable with those reported in autosomal 
dominant Alzheimer disease. US mortality data revealed an increase in life 
expectancy in Down syndrome (median [IQR], 1 [0.3-16] years in 1968 to 57 
[49-61] years in 2019), but with clear ceiling effects in the highest 
percentiles of age at death in the last decades (90th percentile: 1990, age 63 
years; 2019, age 65 years). The mortality data matched the limits projected by a 
distribution assuming fully penetrant Alzheimer disease in up to 80% of deaths 
(corresponding to the highest percentiles). This contrasts with dementia 
mentioned in 30% of death certificates but is in agreement with the mortality 
data in DABNI (78.9%). Important racial disparities persisted in 2019, being 
more pronounced in the lower percentiles (10th percentile: Black individuals, 1 
year; White individuals, 30 years) than in the higher percentiles (90th 
percentile: Black individuals, 64 years; White individuals, 66 years).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the mortality data and 
the consistent age at onset were compatible with fully penetrant Alzheimer 
disease. Lifespan in persons with Down syndrome will not increase until 
disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease are available.

Cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention to reduce potentially 
inappropriate medication.

Finland.

BACKGROUND: Educational interventions can reduce potentially inappropriate 
medication (PIM) use in older people. Their effectiveness has been measured 
mainly as changes in PIM use. In this economic evaluation, we analyse the impact 
of an educational intervention in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs).
METHODS: The educational intervention consisted of activating and interactive 
training sessions for nursing staff and consulting physicians, and was compared 
with treatment as usual (TAU). Participants (n = 227) in a cluster randomised 
trial (cRCT) were residents living permanently in assisted living facilities 
(n = 20 wards). For economic evaluation, participants' healthcare service use 
costs and costs for the intervention were estimated for a 12 month 
period.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for QALYs 
per participant. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a healthcare 
perspective. A bootstrapped cost-effectiveness plane and one-way sensitivity 
analysis were undertaken to analyse the uncertainty surrounding the estimates.
RESULTS: The educational intervention was estimated to be less costly and less 
effective in terms of QALYs than TAU at the 12 month follow-up [incremental 
costs -€1,629, confidence interval (CI) -€5,489 to €2,240; incremental effect 
-0.02, CI -0.06 to 0.02]. The base case ICER was >€80,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: The educational intervention was estimated to be less costly and 
less effective in terms of QALYs compared with TAU, but the results are subject 
to some uncertainties. Reduction in PIM use or benefits in quality of life did 
not seem to translate into improvements in QALYs. Our findings emphasise the 
need for better understanding of the impact of decreasing PIM use on health 
outcomes.

PURPOSE: To explore and describe medical students, postgraduate medical 
trainees, and medical specialists' perceptions of creativity, the importance 
they attach to creativity in contemporary healthcare, and, by extension, how 
they feel creativity can be taught in medical education.
METHODS: The authors conducted seven semi-structured focus groups with medical 
students (n = 10), postgraduate medical trainees (n = 11) and medical 
specialists (n = 13).
RESULTS: Participants had a trifurcated perception of creativity, which they 
described as a form of art that involves thinking and action processes. Facing 
complex patients in a rapidly changing healthcare landscape, doctors needed such 
a multifaceted perspective to be able to adapt and react to new and often 
complex situations that require creativity. Furthermore, participants identified 
conditions that were perceived to stimulate and inhibit creativity in healthcare 
and suggested several techniques to learn creativity.
CONCLUSION: Participants perceived creativity as a form of art that involves 
thinking and action processes. Creativity is important to tackle the challenges 
of current and future workplaces, because it stimulates the search for original 
solutions which are needed in a rapidly changing healthcare landscape. 
Participants proposed different methods and techniques to promote creativity 
learning. However, we need further research to design and implement creativity 
in medical curricula.

BACKGROUND: The improvement of health indicators and life expectancy, especially 
in developed countries, has led to population growth and increased age-related 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the early detection of AD is 
valuable to stop its progress at an early stage.
METHOD: This study systematically reviewed the current state of using deep 
learning methods on neuroimaging data for timely diagnose of AD. We reviewed 
different deep models, modalities, feature extraction strategies, and parameter 
initialization methods to find out which model or strategy could offer better 
performance.
RESULTS: Our search in eight different databases resulted in 736 studies, from 
which 74 studies were included to be reviewed for data analysis. Most studies 
have reported the normal control (NC)/AD classification and have shown desirable 
results. Although recent studies showed promising results of utilizing deep 
models on the NC/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and NC/early MCI (eMCI), other 
classification groups should be taken into consideration and improved.
DISCUSSION: The results of our review indicate that the comparative analysis is 
challenging in this area due to the lack of a benchmark platform; however, 
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models, especially in an ensemble way, 
seem to perform better than other deep models. The transfer learning approach 
also could efficiently improve the performance and time complexity. Further 
research on designing a benchmark platform to facilitate the comparative 
analysis is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a primary cause of pain and disability, and it 
places a considerable economic burden on individuals and the society. In the 
management of total knee or hip replacement (TKHR), the long-term effectiveness 
of physiotherapy interventions may slowly accumulate over a period.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate all the model-based cost-effectiveness (CE) of 
physiotherapy interventions for patients with (TKHR).
DATA SOURCES: A literature search was carried out on AMED, MEDLINE, CINAHL, 
DARE, HTA, NHSEED and cost-effectiveness registry databases from inception to 
May 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies that assessed model-based CE of physiotherapy 
interventions following TKHR and were published in English language. The 
methodological quality of the included studies were assessed using the Philips 
Checklist criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION/DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers, using a predefined data 
extraction form, independently extracted data. A descriptive synthesis was used 
to present the results.
RESULT: Eight hundred eighty-six studies were identified, and the only 3 that 
met the inclusion criteria were included. Different model structures and 
assumptions were used in the included studies. The included studies were 
conducted in the United States of America (n=1), Singapore (n=1) and Italy 
(n=1). The societal (n=2) and healthcare (n=1) perspective were adopted in the 
studies. The included studies reported an incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $57,200 and 27,471 Singapore dollar (SGD) per quality-adjusted life 
years in a time horizon of lifetime and three months, respectively. 
Physiotherapy (hydrotherapy) interventions were potentially cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Based on the best available evidence, the findings of this review 
suggest that physiotherapy interventions were CE and cost saving. However, it is 
important to note that among others the CE of the interventions was a function 
of the healthcare system, duration of interventions, patient compliance and 
price.

INTRODUCTION: Despite growing evidence of the long-term impact of tuberculosis 
(TB) on quality of life, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates of TB-related 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) do not include post-TB morbidity, and 
evaluations of TB interventions typically assume treated patients return to 
pre-TB health. Using primary data, we estimate years of life lost due to 
disability (YLDs), years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and DALYs 
associated with post-TB cardiorespiratory morbidity in a low-income country.
METHODS: Adults aged ≥15 years who had successfully completed treatment for 
drug-sensitive pulmonary TB in Blantyre, Malawi (February 2016-April 2017) were 
followed-up for 3 years with 6-monthly and 12-monthly study visits. In this 
secondary analysis, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire data were used to 
match patients to GBD cardiorespiratory health states and corresponding 
disability weights (DWs) at each visit. YLDs were calculated for the study 
period and estimated for remaining lifespan using Malawian life table life 
expectancies. YLL were estimated using study mortality data and aspirational 
life expectancies, and post-TB DALYs derived. Data were disaggregated by HIV 
status and gender.
RESULTS: At treatment completion, 222/403 (55.1%) participants met criteria for 
a cardiorespiratory DW, decreasing to 15.6% after 3 years, at which point 
two-thirds of the disability burden was experienced by women. Over 90% of 
projected lifetime-YLD were concentrated within the most severely affected 20% 
of survivors. Mean DWs in the 3 years post-treatment were 0.041 (HIV-) and 0.025 
(HIV+), and beyond 3 years estimated as 0.025 (HIV-) and 0.010 (HIV+), compared 
with GBD DWs of 0.408 (HIV+) and 0.333 (HIV-) during active disease. Our results 
imply that the majority of TB-related morbidity occurs post-treatment.
CONCLUSION: TB-related DALYs are greatly underestimated by overlooking post-TB 
disability. The total disability burden of TB is likely undervalued by both GBD 
estimates and economic evaluations of interventions, particularly those aimed at 
early diagnosis and prevention.

BACKGROUND: Thermoinducible bioswitches are unique in that the all-or-none 
switch response is triggered by temperature, which is a global factor that 
impacts all biochemical reaction processes. To date, temperature-inducible 
bioswitches rely exclusively on special thermal sensing biomolecules of DNA, 
RNA, proteins and lipids whose conformations are critically temperature 
dependent.
METHOD: This paper extends the traditional thermal switch by utilizing purposely 
designed network topologies of biomolecular interactions to achieve the 
switching function. By assuming the general Arrhenius law for biochemical 
reactions, we explore the full space of all three-node genetic interaction 
networks to screen topologies capable of thermal bioswitches. Three target 
bioswitches, i.e., thermal-inducible Off-On, cold-inducible On-Off, and hybrid 
Off-On-Off double switches, are considered separately.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify the minimal and core network skeletons that are basic 
and essential for building robust high-performance bioswitches: three Off-On 
motifs, three On-Off motifs, and an incoherent feedforward motif for an 
Off-On-Off double switch. Functional topologies are implicitly preferential in 
choosing parameter values to achieve the target functions. The scenario of the 
topology-based bioswitch we propose here is an extension of molecule-based 
bioswitches and would be valuable in aiding the rational design and synthesis of 
efficient high-performance thermal bioswitches.

[END-OF-LIFE PROGNOSTICATION IN ACUTE HOSPITAL PALLIATIVE PATIENTS: IS THE 
PALLIATIVE PERFORMANCE SCALE USEFUL?].

AIMS: This study examined PPS (Palliative Performance Scale) use as a tool 
estimating life expectancy in patients with various life-threatening diseases 
who required palliative consultation during hospitalization in an acute regional 
hospital in northern Israel.
BACKGROUND: Prognostication is the ability to evaluate outcome and expected 
course of a medical condition based on knowledge and experience. Special 
emphasis is given to the prediction of life expectancy in end-of-life 
situations, as prognosis directs the treatment approach, the policy regarding 
tests and procedures, and discharge planning. Research mentions two main methods 
for assessing life expectancy: one is CPS - Clinician's Prediction of Survival 
and the other is AES - Actuarial Estimation of Survival based on test results, 
statistics and clinical tools. Since physical status correlates well with 
survival, it is included in most prognostication tools.
METHODS: A retrospective study for the period January 2015-September 2018 
examined the records of patients assessed by the Palliative Consult Team (PCT), 
using PPS. Variables were initial PPS score, age, gender, ethnic origin, 
diagnosis and survival time. Patients were monitored six months from initial 
assessment.
RESULTS: A total of 588 patients' records assessed by PCT using PPS, were 
included in the study. Findings showed PPS to be a significant predictor of 
survival for all research groups, with no ethnic differences. In the current 
study population, differences were found between varied diagnoses in life 
expectancy and functional status. It also became clear that life expectancy of 
most subjects with a functional status of PPS-40 and below did not exceed six 
months.
DISCUSSION: This research strengthens the link between functional status and 
life expectancy and is the first in Israel to support the use of the PPS tool as 
part of the prognostication process in patients with a variety of incurable 
diseases. The presentation of findings in survival ranges according to the value 
of PPS is unique to this study and its ability to assist medical staff both in 
making clinical decisions and in choosing the appropriate terminology for the 
sensitive and complex procedure of delivering a prognosis to a patient and loved 
ones.

Patients with advanced/chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 face a high burden 
of comorbidity, physical and mental symptoms, and impaired quality of life 
(QOL). Dialysis, which has become a treatment of choice, cannot supply an 
optimal replacement of the kidney function. Old and fragile dialysis patients 
with multiple comorbidities often need expensive medical treatments, repeated 
hospitalizations, and their life expectancy is not longer than those who have 
chosen not to use dialysis. The WHO emphasizes the need of palliation for 
serious and incurable diseases, such as CKD stage 5. Among patients who suffer 
from under-diagnosis and under-treatment of symptoms, some regret having started 
dialysis. Conservative treatment is offered only in a few cases and only a small 
proportion of patients have signed an Advanced Care Directive. Patients wish to 
receive information about their prognosis and treatment choices, thus feeling in 
control of their treatment. More countries are adopting the ideas of palliative 
care for CKD patients in order to ensure their QOL and to encourage the patients 
and their families to be active partners in the decision-making process. Using a 
palliative care approach can prevent patients from suffering and will reduce 
treatment costs. This review presents the data published on the subject in world 
literature.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented social and economic crisis. 
This study aims at investigating the impact of socio-economic indicators on the 
levels of COVID-19 (confirmed and death cases) in sub-Saharan Africa. The 
investigation makes use of the readily accessible public data: we obtain 
COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins and socio-economic indicators from the World 
Bank. The socio-economic indicators (independent variables) used in the 
multilinear regression were GDP per capita, gross national income per capita, 
life expectancy, population density (people per sq. km of land area), the 
population aged 65 and above, current health expenditure per capita and total 
population. The dependent variables used were the COVID-19 confirmed and death 
cases. Amongst the seven socio-economic indicators, only 4 showed a 
statistically significant impact on COVID-19 cases: population density, gross 
national income per capita, population aged 65 and above and total population. 
The obtained R 2 of 69% and 63% indicated that the socio-economic indicators 
captured and explained the variation of COVID-19 confirmed cases and COVID-19 
death cases, respectively. The startling results obtained in this study were the 
negative but statistically significant relationship between COVID-19 deaths and 
population density and the positive and statistically significant relationship 
between gross national income per capita and COVID-19 cases (both confirmed and 
deaths). Both these results are at odds with literature investigating these

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide 
in which dysregulated protein synthesis plays an etiologic role. The eukaryotic 
elongation factor 1 A1 (eEF1A1) exerts significant effects on protein synthesis 
by contributing to peptide chain extension. Whereas its role in CRC remains to 
be investigated. In this study, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of 
eEF1A1 were significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines and tissues. Elevated 
expression of eEF1A1 was correlated with shorter overall survival in 94 CRC 
patients. The inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle block were observed in 
CRC cells after eEF1A1 downregulation. Mechanistically, weighted gene 
correlation network analysis and further Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) analysis suggested that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 
signaling pathways were significantly enriched in high-eEF1A1 expression group, 
and the levels of phosphorylated p38/JNK/ERK MAPK were dramatically decreased 
after eEF1A1 downregulation. Overexpression of eEF1A1 in CRC correlated with a 
poor prognosis. Collectively, this study determined the oncogenic role of eEF1A1 
in CRC proliferation and tumorigenesis. eEF1A1 might be a promising therapeutic 
target and prognostic biomarker in CRC.

AIM: The aim of this scoping review was to summarise findings concerning 
cognitive characteristics in people with spina bifida and explain how cognitive 
factors influence activities and participation in different areas and stages of 
life.
METHODS: PubMed, Psych INFO, ERIC, Scopus, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were 
searched for English language papers published in 2000-2018. A total of 92 
papers were selected and quality was assessed according to the McMaster 
criteria. The results were presented related to body functions, activity and 
participation from the International Classification of Function and Health, ICF.
RESULTS: People with spina bifida tended to have a lower IQ than those without. 
The majority also had cognitive difficulties manifested in problems with 
language, perception, memory, executive and attentional functions. Those 
difficulties affected activity and participation in all life domains in ICF. 
This may affect medical adherence and responsibility and by extension the 
prevention of secondary complications.
CONCLUSION: It is important for caregivers, professionals and especially 
individuals with spina bifida themselves to understand and handle both physical 
and cognitive consequences in all life circumstances. Having insight into one's 
own assets and difficulties paves the way to managing life challenges, which 
could enhance health, self-management and participation in society.

IMPORTANCE: Prior studies on the association between fine particulate matter 
with diameters 2.5 μm or smaller (PM2.5) and probability of death have not 
applied multilevel analysis disaggregating data for US census tract, states, and 
counties, nor tested its interaction by socioeconomic status (SES). Such an 
approach could provide a more refined identification and targeting of 
populations exposed to increased risk from PM2.5.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between PM2.5 and age-specific mortality 
risk (ASMR) using disaggregated data at the census tract level and evaluate such 
association according to census tract SES.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cross-sectional study used a 
linkage of 3 different data sets. ASMR for the period of 2010 to 2015 was 
obtained from the National Center for Health Statistic, SES data covering a 
period from 2006 to 2016 came from the American Community Survey, and mean PM2.5 
exposure levels from 2010 to 2015 were derived from well-validated atmospheric 
chemistry and machine learning models. Data were analyzed in April 2021.
EXPOSURES: The main exploratory variable was mean census tract-level long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 from 2010 to 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was census tract-level ASMR. 
Multilevel models were used to quantify the geographic variation in ASMR at 
levels of census tract, county, and state. Additional analysis explored the 
interaction of SES in the association of ASMR with PM2.5 exposure.
RESULTS: Data from 67 148 census tracts nested in 3087 counties and 50 states 
were analyzed. The association between exposure to PM2.5 and ASMR varied 
substantially across census tracts. The magnitude of such association also 
varied across age groups, being higher among adults and older adults. Census 
tracts accounted for most of the total geographic variation in mortality risk 
(range, 77.0%-94.2%). ASMR was higher in deciles with greater PM2.5 
concentration. For example, ASMR for age 75 to 84 years was 54.6 per 1000 
population higher in the decile with the second-highest PM2.5 concentration than 
in the decile with the lowest PM2.5 concentration. The ASMR, PM2.5 
concentrations, and magnitude of the association between both were higher in the 
census tracts with the lowest SES.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that census tracts 
with lower SES presented higher PM2.5 concentrations. ASMR and air pollution 
varied substantially across census tracts. There was an association between air 
pollution and ASMR across all age groups in the United States. These findings 
suggest that equitable public policies aimed at improving air quality are needed 
and important to increase life expectancy.

Previous studies have shown that the polyamine spermidine increased the maximum 
life span in C. elegans and the median life span in mice. Since spermidine 
increases autophagy, we asked if treatment with chloroquine, an inhibitor of 
autophagy, would shorten the lifespan of mice. Recently, chloroquine has 
intensively been discussed as a treatment option for COVID-19 patients. To rule 
out unfavorable long-term effects on longevity, we examined the effect of 
chronic treatment with chloroquine given in the drinking water on the lifespan 
and organ pathology of male middle-aged NMRI mice. We report that, surprisingly, 
daily treatment with chloroquine extended the median life span by 11.4% and the 
maximum life span of the middle-aged male NMRI mice by 11.8%. Subsequent 
experiments show that the chloroquine-induced lifespan elevation is associated 
with dose-dependent increase in LC3B-II, a marker of autophagosomes, in the 
liver and heart that was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Quite 
intriguingly, chloroquine treatment was also associated with a decrease in 
glycogenolysis in the liver suggesting a compensatory mechanism to provide 
energy to the cell. Accumulation of autophagosomes was paralleled by an 
inhibition of proteasome-dependent proteolysis in the liver and the heart as 
well as with decreased serum levels of insulin growth factor binding protein-3 
(IGFBP3), a protein associated with longevity. We propose that inhibition of 
proteasome activity in conjunction with an increased number of autophagosomes 
and decreased levels of IGFBP3 might play a central role in lifespan extension 
by chloroquine in male NMRI mice.

BACKGROUND: Both incidence and mortality of diagnosed diabetes have decreased 
over the past decade. However, the impact of these changes on key metrics of 
diabetes burden-lifetime risk (LR), years of potential life lost (YPLL), and 
years spent with diabetes-is unknown.
METHODS: We used data from 653,811 adults aged ≥18 years from the National 
Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional sample of the civilian 
non-institutionalized population in the United States. LR, YPLL, and years spent 
with diabetes were estimated from age 18 to 84 by survey period (1997-1999, 
2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2018). The age-specific incidence of 
diagnosed diabetes and mortality were estimated using Poisson regression. A 
multistate difference equation accounting for competing risks was used to model 
each metric.
RESULTS: LR and years spent with diabetes initially increased then decreased 
over the most recent time periods. LR for adults at age 20 increased from 31.7% 
(95% CI: 31.2-32.1%) in 1997-1999 to 40.7% (40.2-41.1%) in 2005-2009, then 
decreased to 32.8% (32.4-33.2%) in 2015-2018. Both LR and years spent with 
diabetes were markedly higher among adults of non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and 
other races compared to non-Hispanic Whites. YPLL significantly decreased over 
the study period, with the estimated YPLL due to diabetes for an adult aged 20 
decreasing from 8.9 (8.7-9.1) in 1997-1999 to 6.2 (6.1-6.4) in 2015-2018 (p = 
0.02).
CONCLUSION: In the United States, diabetes burden is declining, but disparities 
by race/ethnicity remain. LR remains high with approximately one-third of adults 
estimated to develop diabetes during their lifetime.

Treating Severe Refractory and Augmented Restless Legs Syndrome.

Winkelman JW(1).

Electronic address: jwwinkelman@mgh.harvard.edu.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurologic disorder present to a 
clinically significant degree in 2% to 3% of the adult population, more commonly 
with advancing age and in women, that dramatically affects sleep and quality of 
life. Addressing factors that worsen RLS (eg, iron deficiency, antidepressant or 
antihistamine administration, OSA) is an important first step in treatment. RLS 
can generally be well treated with medications such as the alpha2-delta calcium 
channel ligands (A2Ds) gabapentin, pregabalin, and gabapentin enacarbil or, if 
these are poorly tolerated or lack efficacy, the dopamine agonists (DAs) 
pramipexole, ropinirole, or rotigotine. Oral or IV iron supplementation is often 
efficacious as initial treatment in patients with low normal serum indexes. 
However, at least one-third of patients do not achieve acceptable symptom relief 
from initial treatments. Furthermore, DAs, the most commonly used medications 
for RLS, commonly produce augmentation, a progressive, long-term, iatrogenic 
worsening of RLS symptoms characterized by increasing severity as well as 
temporal and anatomic extension of symptoms. If dopaminergic augmentation of RLS 
is present, substitution of an A2D or opioid for the DA is the primary goal. 
However, given the profound rebound RLS and insomnia that occurs with even small 
dose reductions of DAs, the initial change should be the addition of one of 
these alternate treatments. Once adequate doses, or symptom relief, are achieved 
with the second agent, subsequent very slow down-titration and discontinuation 
of the DA is often possible and can lead to dramatic long-term relief of RLS 
symptoms and improvement in sleep.

BACKGROUND: Effective symptom control in painful knee osteoarthritis (OA) may 
improve patient quality of life. In a randomised crossover trial (NCT03381248), 
COOLIEF* cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) reduced pain and stiffness and 
improved physical function and quality of life compared with intra-articular 
hyaluronan (HA) injections. The present study aimed to establish the cost 
effectiveness of CRFA versus intra-articular HA injections for treating 
moderate-to-severe OA knee pain from a US Medicare perspective.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using utility data (EQ-5D) 
from the randomised crossover trial of CRFA versus intra-articular HA 
injections, which had follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients in the HA 
group with unsatisfactory outcomes (e.g., continued pain) at 6 months could 
cross over to CRFA. Economic analysis outcomes included quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost effectiveness (cost per QALY gained). 
Base-case analyses were modelled on a 6-month time horizon (to trial crossover). 
Due to limited trial data in the HA arm beyond 6 months, scenarios explored 
potential outcomes to 12 months if: 1) Utility with HA persisted for a further 
6 months; 2) A second HA injection was received at 6 months and achieved the 
same utility change for the second 6 months. In both scenarios, the CRFA arm 
used trial data for patients who received CRFA from baseline to 12 months. 
Alternative costing scenarios were also explored.
RESULTS: CRFA resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.020 at an incremental 
cost of US$1707, equating to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
US$84,392 per QALY over 6 months, versus intra-articular HA injections. 
Extending the analysis to 12 months and assuming persistence in utility in the 
HA arm resulted in a larger utility gain for CRFA (0.056 QALYs) and a lower ICER 
of US$30,275 per QALY. If patients received a second HA injection, the 
incremental benefit of CRFA out to 12 months was reduced (QALY gain 0.043) but 
was offset by the costs of the second HA injection (incremental cost US$832). 
This resulted in an ICER of US$19,316 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: CRFA is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with 
OA-related knee pain considering the typical US threshold of US$100,000/QALY.

AIMS: The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
KTE-X19 versus standard of care (SoC) in the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) post-Bruton tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (BTKi) treatment from a UK healthcare perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model 
(pre-progression, post-progression and death) with a cycle length of one month 
was used to extrapolate progression-free and overall survival over a lifetime 
horizon. Population inputs along with KTE-X19 (brexucabtagene autoleucel) 
efficacy and safety data were derived from the single-arm trial ZUMA-2 
(NCT02601313). The composition of SoC was informed by a literature-based 
meta-analysis, SoC efficacy data were obtained from the SCHOLAR-2 real-world 
study. Survival was modelled using standard parametric curves for SoC and a 
mixture-cure methodology for KTE-X19. It was assumed that patients whose disease 
had not progressed after five years experienced long-term remission. Costs, 
resource use and utility, and adverse event disutility inputs were obtained from 
published literature and publicly available data sources. An annual discount 
rate of 3.5% was applied to costs and health outcomes. Modelled outcomes for 
KTE-X19 and SoC included expected life years (LY), quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) and total costs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and 
scenario analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Estimated median survival was 5.96 years for KTE-X19 and 1.38 for SoC. 
Discounted LYs, QALYs and lifetime costs were 8.27, 5.99 and £385,765 for 
KTE-X19 versus 1.98, 1.48 and £79,742 for SoC, respectively. The KTE-X19 versus 
SoC cost per QALY was £67,713 and the cost per LY was £48,645. Influential 
scenario analyses use alternative KTE-X19 survival curves and discount rates, 
and shorter time horizons.
CONCLUSION: Considering the survival and quality of life benefits compared to 
SoC, KTE-X19 for R/R MCL appears as a cost-effective treatment in the real-world 
UK setting.
