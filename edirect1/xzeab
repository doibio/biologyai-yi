Numerous studies have emphasised the importance of the gut microbiota during 
early life and its role in modulating neurodevelopment and behaviour. 
Epidemiological studies have shown that early-life antibiotic exposure can 
increase an individual's risk of developing immune and metabolic diseases. 
Moreover, preclinical studies have shown that long-term antibiotic-induced 
microbial disruption in early life can have enduring effects on physiology, 
brain function and behaviour. However, these studies have not investigated the 
impact of targeted antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion during critical 
developmental windows and how this may be related to neurodevelopmental 
outcomes. Here, we addressed this gap by administering a broad-spectrum oral 
antibiotic cocktail (ampicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and imipenem) to mice 
during one of three putative critical windows: the postnatal (PN; P2-9), 
pre-weaning (PreWean; P12-18), or post-weaning (Wean; P21-27) developmental 
periods and assessed the effects on physiology and behaviour in later life. Our 
results demonstrate that targeted microbiota disruption during early life has 
enduring effects into adolescence on the structure and function of the caecal 
microbiome, especially for antibiotic exposure during the weaning period. 
Further, we show that microbial disruption in early life selectively alters 
circulating immune cells and modifies neurophysiology in adolescence, including 
altered myelin-related gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and altered 
microglial morphology in the basolateral amygdala. We also observed sex and 
time-dependent effects of microbiota depletion on anxiety-related behavioural 
outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Antibiotic-induced microbial disruption 
had limited and subtle effects on social behaviour and did not have any 
significant effects on depressive-like behaviour, short-term working, or 
recognition memory. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the gut 
microbiota during critical windows of development and the subtle but long-term 
effects that microbiota-targeted perturbations can have on brain physiology and 
behaviour.

Economic Evaluation of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Versus Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy for Suicide Prevention.

University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA,jyacolin@uw.edu.

BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death for adults aged 18-64 in the 
United States, and suicide risk is highest among those with previous attempts. 
Two evidence-based treatments for suicide prevention exist: dialectical 
behavioral therapy (DBT), a year-long intensive treatment, and cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), a brief (10-12 session) treatment. To our knowledge, 
no direct comparison of the two treatments yet exists AIMS: To analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of DBT compared to CBT, in terms of both cost and quality of 
life, for the prevention of future suicide attempt among previous attempters.
METHODS: A Markov Model was developed to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2022 US dollars per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). Published literature was reviewed to identify parameter 
estimates. The target population was US adults aged 18-64 with a previous 
suicide attempt. A time horizon of one year was used, and costs were calculated 
from the health care system perspective.
RESULTS: Compared to CBT, DBT is associated with an estimated incremental cost 
of USD26,362 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) revealed 
consistent results, with DBT being cost-effective in most cases at a maximum 
threshold of USD50,000 per QALY.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest that, compared to CBT, DBT is associated with 
comparable costs and mortality but higher quality of life. Due to the limited 
evidence base, caution is recommended when interpreting and generalizing 
results.
IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: Given comparable cost and 
efficacy, patient preference for CBT or DBT must be incorporated in treatment 
selection. Ensuring patients play an active role in treatment selection has the 
potential to lead to improved clinical and health system outcomes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: As manualized treatments, both DBT and CBT are 
appropriate for trained master's level clinicians to deliver. Allowing master's 
level clinicians to provide evidence-based care for suicide prevention may be a 
cost-effective strategy for quality service provision.
IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Future research grounded in conceptual 
theories of suicide that distinguish suicide risk from more general psychiatric 
risks are needed.

In the course of a quest for therapeutic agents inhibiting uropathogens, the 
rise and universal blowout of antibiotic-resistant organisms is a wide problem. 
To overcome this matter, exploration of alternative antimicrobials is necessary. 
The antimicrobial potential of quercetin has been widely described against some 
pathogenic microorganisms, but to the best of our knowledge, no report exists 
against the pathogenicity of uropathogenic Serratia marcescens. Hence, the 
present study focused on the antibacterial mechanism of action of quercetin, a 
flavonoid against the uropathogen Serratia marcescens. Quercetin was evaluated 
for its anti-QS activity, and the attained outcomes showed that quercetin 
inhibited QS-mediated virulence factors such as biofilm formation, 
exopolysaccharides, swarming motility and prodigiosin in Serratia marcescens. 
The proposed mechanism of action of quercetin greatly influences cell metabolism 
and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis and damages the cell membrane, as 
revealed through global metabolome profiling. In vivo experiments revealed that 
treatment with quercetin prolonged the life expectancy of infected 
Caenorhabditis elegans and reduced the colonization of Serratia marcescens. 
Hence, the current study reveals the use of quercetin as a probable substitute 
for traditional antibiotics in the treatment of uropathogen infections driven by 
biofilms.

BACKGROUND: Fragility fractures of the sacrum (FFS) have been detected more and 
more frequently in recent times, and the incidence will continue to increase due 
to increasing life expectancy. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical 
outcome of conservative, interventional and surgical treatment of FFS.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 292 patients (276 women, 16 men) with confirmed FFS 
were followed up over a period of 2 years. The age of the women was Ø 81.2 (58 - 
99) and that of the men Ø 78.1 (76 - 85) years. The pain was quantified using a 
VAS. Fractures were classified in accordance with the Rommens and Hofmann and 
with the Denis classification using conventional X-rays, CT and MRI. A QCT of 
the lumbar spine was performed to quantify bone mineral density. Concomitant 
diseases of every patient were recorded. An interdisciplinary case conference 
determined the individual treatment concept considering the age, type of 
fracture, pain level and comorbidities with classification into conservative, 
interventional (any type of sacroplasty) or surgical treatment. Over the course 
pain and independence were measured, complications and patient satisfaction were 
documented. A vitamin D determination was done, and existing comorbidities were 
included.
RESULTS: Patients with a pain level of ≤5 benefited from the conservative 
therapy measures, with pain levels > 5 significantly delaying the development of 
mobility. After sacroplasty, the pain reduced significantly, which caused a 
rapid improvement in mobility without any significant difference being found 
between vertebro- (VSP), balloon (BSP), radiofrequency (RFS) and cement 
sacroplasty (CSP). In terms of pain reduction and mobilization, the surgical 
treated patients benefited from osteosynthesis, although more complex fracture 
types with lumbopelvic stabilization took longer. Overall, there were no deaths 
during the hospital stay. Mortality after 12 months was 21.7% for the 
conservative, 8.4% for the interventional and 13.6% for the surgical therapy 
group; the differences are significant. For patients in the conservative therapy 
group who were difficult to mobilize due to pain, the mortality increased to 
24.3%. Over 24 months, patients achieved the best independence after 
sacroplasty. At 12 and 24 months, subjective satisfaction with the therapies was 
best after sacroplasty, followed by osteosynthesis and conservative measures. 
All patients had a pronounced vitamin D deficiency and manifest osteoporosis. 
Cardiovascular pathologies were the main concomitant diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FFS with a low level of pain benefit from 
conservative therapy measures, whereby complications and mortality increase 
significantly in the case of persistent immobilizing pain. Patients with an 
unacceptable level of pain resulting from non-dislocated fractures benefit 
significantly from sacroplasty. Patients with unstable and displaced fractures 
(Rommens and Hofmann type III and IV) should be operated on promptly. Different 
techniques are available for sacroplasty and osteosynthesis, which lead to an 
improvement of independence and a reduction in mortality.

Nowadays in China, digital technology is sweeping all walks of life. To deal 
with the increasing incidence of chronic diseases and people's pursuit of a 
healthy life expectancy, modern nutrition, which is a core element in the 
prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, has gradually entered the digital 
age and raised broader needs and higher standards for achieving individualized 
precision nutrition. Artificial intelligence and augmented reality technologies 
have been used to improve the accuracy of dietary surveys. The digital dietary 
quality monitoring and evaluation system established by integrating multiple 
nutritional and health databases are conducive to scientifically and effectively 
assessing the overall dietary quality. Wearable devices and chemical sensors 
have made nutrition assessment more efficient. Digital and precise nutrition 
developed for different populations and different diseases are realized. 
Nutrition education has been carried out rapidly with the popularization of 
"Internet+", new media, and application software. The various digital 
intelligent technologies have gradually penetrated into the dietetics field and 
empowered personalized health management. In addition, the technologies of 
digital nutrition in China still face a lot of challenges from theory to 
practice. How to promote scientific and technological innovation in digital 
nutrition to stimulate and enhance people's nutritional health is the major task 
ahead of nutrition science nowadays. This article will briefly introduce digital 
nutrition survey and assessment, digital nutrition intervention, and intelligent 
nutrition education, in order to provide a reference for realizing national 
nutrition and health by digital means.

The study assesses the effect of inclusive education on health performance in 48 
Sub Saharan African countries from 2000 to 2020. The study adopted the 
Driscoll/Kraay technique to address cross-sectional dependence and the GMM 
strategy to address potential endogeneity. The study employed three indicators 
of health performance which are the total life expectancy, the female life 
expectancy and the male life expectancy. Three gender parity index of 
educational enrolments are employed: primary education, secondary and the 
tertiary education as indicators of inclusive education. The findings of the 
study reveal that inclusive education enhances the health situation of 
individuals in Sub Saharan Africa. The findings further show that the health 
situation of both the male and the female are improved by inclusive education. 
The study recommends policymakers in this region to invest more in the education 
and the health sector so as to enhance the health performance of the citizens.

INTRODUCTION: VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) 
syndrome is a recently described, late-onset, acquired autoinflammatory disorder 
caused by mutations in the UBA1 gene. The various clinical manifestations of 
VEXAS broadly divided into inflammatory or haematological. VEXAS defines a new 
disease category - the hematoinflammatory disorders triggered by somatic 
mutations restricted to blood but causing systemic inflammation with multi-organ 
involvement and associated with aberrant bone marrow status. VEXAS causes 
significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, but the optimum standard of 
care remains undefined.
AREAS COVERED: This review describes the discovery of VEXAS, relevant genetic 
causes and immunopathology of the disease. A detailed account of its various 
clinical manifestations and disease mimics is provided. Current treatment and 
management options are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: New rare variants in UBA1 and VEXAS-like UBA1 negative cases are 
reported. Consensus diagnostic criteria might be required to define VEXAS and 
its related disorders. Investigation of sporadic, VEXAS-like cases will require 
the application of deep sequencing using DNA obtained from various cellular or 
tissue locations. Prospective studies are needed to define the optimal 
supportive and treatment options for patients with varying disease severity and 
prognosis. VEXAS-specific hematopoietic stem cell transplant selection criteria 
also require development.

Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether other outcome measures used in health technology 
assessment (HTA) address the criticisms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: HTA methods guidance from 11 US comparator 
countries (the G10 and Australia) and six value frameworks from US organizations 
were reviewed to identify health outcome measures currently used to evaluate the 
benefits of a drug.
STUDY DESIGN: The study involved a documentary analysis of guidelines to 
identify outcome measures used by the sampled HTA organizations. Similar 
outcomes were grouped together into outcome types. Each type was analyzed to 
determine the extent to which it replicates key advantages and responds to 
criticisms of QALYs extracted from the literature.
EXTRACTION METHODS: Outcomes were included if guidance from at least one HTA 
organization identified the outcome as acceptable for HTA. Outcomes measuring or 
evaluating the benefit, clinical effect, or impact of a drug or health 
technology was included; methods of calculating costs were excluded.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Seven types of outcome measures were identified falling into 
three groups: preference-based, single-dimension outcomes, and outcomes using 
non-health perspectives. Among the seven QALY alternative outcome measures 
currently used for HTA by the sampled countries, no one outcome measure 
addresses all the QALY criticisms while retaining the advantageous features of 
the QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Proposals to adopt health technology assessment (HTA) to support 
value-based pricing of prescription drugs in the US have faced pushback over the 
use of the QALY. There is no single "right" outcome measure, and the criticisms 
of QALYs apply to other outcome measures used to evaluate health. The measures 
identified have different features and strengths, which may be appropriate for 
specific decision making goals, but the QALY remains the best option for 
decision making that requires comparisons of the overall societal value of 
health gains.

IMPORTANCE: Pelvic organ prolapse is a prevalent condition among women that 
negatively affects their quality of life. With increasing life expectancy, the 
global need for cost-effective care for women with pelvic organ prolapse will 
continue to increase.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether treatment with a pessary is noninferior to 
surgery among patients with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The PEOPLE project was a noninferiority 
randomized clinical trial conducted in 21 participating hospitals in the 
Netherlands. A total of 1605 women with symptomatic stage 2 or greater pelvic 
organ prolapse were requested to participate between March 2015 through November 
2019; 440 gave informed consent. Final 24-month follow-up ended at June 30, 
2022.
INTERVENTIONS: Two hundred eighteen participants were randomized to receive 
pessary treatment and 222 to surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was subjective patient-reported 
improvement at 24 months, measured with the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement scale, a 7-point Likert scale ranging from very much better to very 
much worse. This scale was dichotomized as successful, defined as much better or 
very much better, vs nonsuccessful treatment. The noninferiority margin was set 
at 10 percentage points risk difference. Data of crossover between therapies and 
adverse events were captured.
RESULTS: Among 440 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [9.29] 
years), 173 (79.3%) in the pessary group and 162 (73.3%) in the surgery group 
completed the trial at 24 months. In the population, analyzed as randomized, 
subjective improvement was reported by 132 of 173 (76.3%) in the pessary group 
vs 132 of 162 (81.5%) in the surgery group (risk difference, -6.1% [1-sided 95% 
CI, -12.7 to ∞]; P value for noninferiority, .16). The per-protocol analysis 
showed a similar result for subjective improvement with 52 of 74 (70.3%) in the 
pessary group vs 125 of 150 (83.3%) in the surgery group (risk difference, 
-13.1% [1-sided 95% CI, -23.0 to ∞]; P value for noninferiority, .69). Crossover 
from pessary to surgery occurred among 118 of 218 (54.1%) participants. The most 
common adverse event among pessary users was discomfort (42.7%) vs urinary tract 
infection (9%) following surgery.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with symptomatic pelvic organ 
prolapse, an initial strategy of pessary therapy, compared with surgery, did not 
meet criteria for noninferiority with regard to patient-reported improvement at 
24 months. Interpretation is limited by loss to follow-up and the large amount 
of participant crossover from pessary therapy to surgery.

University, Normal.

PURPOSE: Children in foster care are at an increased risk for language delays 
and disorders, and foster parents can play a significant role in preventing 
delays in early language development. This scoping review explored empirical 
studies that included foster parent training programs for families with foster 
children under the age of 5 years.
METHOD: Using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews), multiple databases were 
searched, and resulting article titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion 
in the review. Each study that met inclusion criteria was then coded for the 
training methods used to teach foster parents intervention strategies and the 
targeted outcomes of the intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were identified. Of the 24 studies reviewed, all 
included interventions focused on increasing parent-child relationships and 
decreasing child challenging behaviors, but few included opportunities for 
foster parents to practice using intervention strategies with their foster 
child. None of the studies focused specifically on strategies for promoting 
children's language development. When outcomes across the studies were reviewed, 
only two focused on children's language.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review point to the need for more research on 
language interventions that can be implemented by foster parents. The discussion 
focuses on the important role speech-language pathologists can play in the 
prevention of early language delays or disorders in young foster children.

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) carries a risk of spinal cord 
ischemia (SCI) which exerts a devastating impact on patient's quality of life 
and life expectancy. Although routine prophylactic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
drainage is not unequivocally supported by current data, several studies have 
demonstrated favorable outcomes. Patients at high risk for SCI following TEVAR 
likely will benefit from prophylactic CSF drains. However, the intervention is 
not risk free, and thorough risk/benefit analysis should be individualized to 
each patient.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a scoping review of the literature on psychological 
interventions directed to identify primary prevention strategies for depression 
among adult head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.
METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review including 
relevant studies within the PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases. Two authors 
independently screened the searches and reviewed the included articles according 
to the predetermined eligibility criteria based on the PICOS format. Studies 
included subjects with previous or current diagnosis of depression were 
excluded. The risk of bias assessment of these trials was conducted following 
the Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials. The 
search was repeated prior to submission to ensure all current articles meeting 
criteria were included.
RESULTS: The search yielded 875 studies. The title and abstract screen, followed 
by the review of full texts identified five articles that met inclusion 
criteria. Four were randomized controlled trials (RCT) and the fifth was a 
non-randomized but controlled study. Different psychosocial interventions were 
used, including psycho-educational interventions, psychosocial counseling, and 
pharmacotherapy. All studies established the diagnosis of depression or screened 
for the diagnosis using standardized psychiatric assessment tools, either 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria or validated 
patient reported outcome measures. The average follow-up periods after 
intervention was 9.8 months. There was a significant decrease in the incidence 
of depression or depressive symptoms favoring the intervention group in three 
out of the five studies that were included.
CONCLUSION: Psychological interventions identified thus far studying primary 
prevention of depression in HNC patients show promising results. However, the 
paucity of data and heterogeneity of the interventions challenges the ability to 
compare the prevention modalities and outcomes. Future well-designed RCTs with 
large sample sizes are recommended to better conclude a result of effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Poor housing conditions have been associated with increased 
mortality. Our objective is to investigate the association between housing 
inequality and increased mortality in Belgium and to estimate the number of 
deaths that could be prevented if the population of the whole country faced the 
mortality rates experienced in areas that are least deprived in terms of 
housing.
METHODS: We used individual-level mortality data extracted from the National 
Register in Belgium and relative to deaths that occurred between Jan. 1, 1991, 
and Dec. 31, 2020. Spatial and time-specific housing deprivation indices (1991, 
2001, and 2011) were created at the level of the smallest geographical unit in 
Belgium, with these units assigned into deciles from the most to the least 
deprived. We calculated mortality associated with housing inequality as the 
difference between observed and expected deaths by applying mortality rates of 
the least deprived decile to other deciles. We also used standard life table 
calculations to estimate the potential years of life lost due housing 
inequality.
RESULTS: Up to 18.5% (95% CI 17.7-19.3) of all deaths between 1991 and 2020 may 
be associated with housing inequality, corresponding to 584,875 deaths. Over 
time, life expectancy at birth increased for the most and least deprived deciles 
by about 3.5 years. The gap in life expectancy between the two deciles remained 
high, on average 4.6 years. Life expectancy in Belgium would increase by 
approximately 3 years if all deciles had the mortality rates of the least 
deprived decile.
CONCLUSIONS: Thousands of deaths in Belgium could be avoided if all Belgian 
neighborhoods had the mortality rates of the least deprived areas in terms of 
housing. Hotspots of housing inequalities need to be located and targeted with 
tailored public actions.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three permanent vascular 
accesses for maintenance hemodialysis patients from a hospital perspective 
throughout 5 years, which is the average life expectancy of patients with 
end-stage kidney disease.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a EuroQol(EQ-5D) questionnaire survey between 
January 2021 and March 2021 with 250 patients to estimate the health utility of 
various states in patients under different hemodialysis vascular access. We 
designed a Markov model and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of three hemodialysis vascular access in Guangzhou 
throughout 5 years.
RESULTS: The mean costs were US$44,481 with tunneled-cuffed catheter (TCC), and 
US$68,952 and US$59,247 with arteriovenous graft (AVG) and autogenous 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF), respectively. The mean quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) was 1.41 with TCC, and 2.37 and 2.73 with AVG and AVF, respectively. AVG 
had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$25,491 per QALY over 
TCC; AVF had an ICER of -US$26,958 per QALY over AVG. At a willingness to pay 
below US$10,633.8 per QALY, TCC is likely the most cost-effective vascular 
access. At any willingness to pay between US$10,633.8 and US$30,901.4 per QALY, 
AVF is likely the most cost-effective vascular access.
CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate the value of AVF given its relative 
cost-effectiveness to other hemodialysis modalities. Although AVG costs much 
more than TCC for slightly higher QALYs than TCC, AVG still has a greater 
advantage over TCC for patients with longer life expectancy due to its lower 
probability of death.

Episiotomy is a surgically planned incision of the perineum and the posterior 
vaginal wall in the second stage of labour. It is one of the most commonly 
performed surgical procedures in the world. In episiotomy, the vaginal orifice 
is made larger to facilitate the birth of a baby. The postnatal period is very 
crucial in every mother's life, especially those who had a vaginal delivery and 
underwent episiotomy. Maternal benefits of episiotomy include reduced risk of 
perineal trauma, subsequent pelvic floor dysfunction and prolapse, urinary 
incontinence, faecal incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. Potential benefits 
for the foetus are thought to include a shortened second stage of labour. 
However, an episiotomy can also lead to potential adverse consequences, 
including the extension to a third- or fourth-degree tear, anal sphincter 
dysfunction, and dyspareunia. Different approaches can be adopted to reduce 
these complications in the postpartum period, including cleanliness, cold packs, 
sitz baths, kegel exercises, perineal care, and topical application of dry 
heat-infrared lamp therapy. Of all these approaches, infrared lamp therapy and 
sitz baths are the two most effective and commonly used for episiotomy pain 
relief and wound healing. In infrared lamp therapy, radiant heat or infrared 
rays are used to produce heat that is then applied to the episiotomy wound to 
facilitate pain relief and wound healing, while a sitz bath is a moist heat 
application process that is also effective for episiotomy pain relief and wound 
healing. This review aims to offer the most thorough understanding of 
episiotomy, its current concept, and episiotomy pain relief, with a particular 
focus on infrared lamp therapy and sitz baths.

The average life expectancy is increasing globally due to advancements in 
medical technology, preventive health care, and a growing emphasis on 
gerontological health. Therefore, developing technologies that detect and track 
aging-associated disease in cognitive function among older adult populations is 
imperative. In particular, research related to automatic detection and 
evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical given the disease's 
prevalence and the cost of current methods. As AD impacts the acoustics of 
speech and vocabulary, natural language processing and machine learning provide 
promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. We compare and contrast the 
performance of ten linear regression models for predicting Mini-Mental Status 
Exam scores on the ADReSS challenge dataset. We extracted 13000+ handcrafted and 
learned features that capture linguistic and acoustic phenomena. Using a subset 
of 54 top features selected by two methods: (1) recursive elimination and (2) 
correlation scores, we outperform a state-of-the-art baseline for the same task. 
Upon scoring and evaluating the statistical significance of each of the selected 
subset of features for each model, we find that, for the given task, handcrafted 
linguistic features are more significant than acoustic and learned features.

Scratching beyond the surface - minimal actin assemblies as tools to elucidate 
mechanical reinforcement and shape change.

The interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane in 
eukaryotic cells is integral to a large number of functions such as shape 
change, mechanical reinforcement and contraction. These phenomena are driven by 
the architectural regulation of a thin actin network, directly beneath the 
membrane through interactions with a variety of binding proteins, membrane 
anchoring proteins and molecular motors. An increasingly common approach to 
understanding the mechanisms that drive these processes is to build model 
systems from reconstituted lipids, actin filaments and associated actin-binding 
proteins. Here we review recent progress in this field, with a particular 
emphasis on how the actin cytoskeleton provides mechanical reinforcement, drives 
shape change and induces contraction. Finally, we discuss potential future 
developments in the field, which would allow the extension of these techniques 
to more complex cellular processes.

Heliothinae soil pupation is understudied despite the key role this life stage 
plays in their development. Many Heliothinae are important agricultural pests 
and understanding the interplay of environment and pupation is important to 
optimize pest management tactics oriented toward pupae. We studied the impact of 
three soil types (coarse sand, high organic muck, and fine-textured clay) on 
Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) in-season and overwintering pupal survivorship, 
diapause, depth, and weight in at two locations (North and South Carolina). We 
introduced wild-collected (in-season) and laboratory-reared (over the winter) 
infestations of H. zea larvae to each of the three soils and later excavated 
pupae. In-season and over the winter pupal survivorship was lower in 
fine-textured clay soils than in coarse sand or high organic muck. In addition, 
pupal depth and weight, in-season and over the winter, varied significantly by 
soil type. In general, depth was the shallowest, and pupae weight was lower when 
recovered from fine-textured clay soils. Finally, diapausing characteristics 
varied significantly by location and year, likely impacted by differing 
environmental conditions. Our results suggest that fine-textured clay soils 
negatively impact Heliothinae pupation and may be suppressing populations in 
areas with these soil types.

[The evolution of personalized medicine: publications review].

[Article in Russian; Abstract available in Russian from the publisher]

Rykov MY(1).

(1)N. A. Semashko National Research Institute of Public Health.

The personalized medicine is based on suggestion that each person has unique 
characteristics at molecular, physiological, ecological and behavioral levels. 
In case of development of disease one is to be treated considering these unique 
characteristics. This belief was to some extent confirmed by application of such 
newest technologies as DNA sequencing, proteomics, imaging protocols and 
application of wireless health monitoring devices which established large 
inter-individual differences.The purpose of the study was to summarize and 
systematize the results of publications on personalized medicine and its 
development.The search for scientific articles was carried out, including the 
published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in Pubmed, WoS, Scopus and RSCI. The 
review covers 49 articles considering new technologies that make possible the 
personalized medicine possible, new experience, modes of verification and 
application of individualized medications as well as potential means of treating 
people with fertility problems and infertility.The individualization of medical 
practice in particular cases is probably inevitable all the more the individual 
approach to patient becomes more effective and cost-effective. The accessibility 
of modern biomedical technologies, emergence of wireless monitoring devices 
allows to implement "personalized" approach to early, subclinical diagnostic, 
individualization of treatment in order to obtain maximal efficiency and minimal 
toxicity of therapy, prevention of relapse of disease and its prevention. The 
technology of cell avatars will permit to prognose development of diseases and, 
possibly, life expectancy too. The personalized approach in reproductology based 
on genetic research will permit to eliminate a number of hereditary, orphan 
diseases in XXI century the same way as studies in immunology and development of 
vaccines made it possible to eliminate black smallpox in XX century.Conclusion. 
The future challenges consist not only in looking for new manifold modes of 
characterizing patient, but also in personalization of therapy, development of 
individual medication and disease prevention schemes. It is presumably that 
applying more relevant models based on human cell cultures will allow not only 
to study pharmacodynamics of medications, but also to implement personalized 
selection of medication therapy, considering nature of disease and comorbid 
background of patient.

Publisher: Персонализированная медицина основана на утверждении, что каждый 
человек обладает уникальными характеристиками на молекулярном, физиологическом, 
экологическом и поведенческом уровнях, и в случае развития болезни ее лечение 
следует проводить с учетом этих уникальных характеристик. Это убеждение было в 
некоторой степени подтверждено применением новейших технологий (секвенирование 
ДНК, протеомика, протоколы визуализации и использования беспроводных устройств 
для мониторинга состояния здоровья), которые выявили большие межиндивидуальные 
различия.Цель исследования - обобщить и систематизировать результаты 
исследований, посвященных персонализированной медицине и ее развитию.Проведен 
поиск источников литературы (научных статей), включая опубликованные в 
рецензируемых журналах, индексируемых в Pubmed, Wos, Scopus и РИНЦ. В обзор 
включены 49 статей, посвященных новым технологиям, которые делают возможной 
персонализированную медицину, новый опыт, способы проверки и применения 
индивидуализированных лекарств, а также потенциальные способы лечения людей с 
проблемами фертильности и бесплодия.Индивидуализация медицинской практики в 
определенных случаях, вероятно, неизбежна, тем более что индивидуальный подход к 
пациенту становится более эффективным и рентабельным. Доступность современных 
биомедицинских технологий, появление устройств беспроводного мониторинга 
позволяют осуществлять персонифицированный подход к ранней, субклинической 
диагностике, индивидуализации лечения с целью получения максимальной 
эффективности и минимальной токсичности терапии, предупреждения рецидива 
заболевания и его профилактики. Технология клеточных аватаров позволит 
прогнозировать развитие заболеваний и, возможно, продолжительность жизни. 
Персонифицированный подход в репродуктологии, опирающийся на генетические 
исследования, позволит ликвидировать ряд наследственных, орфанных заболеваний в 
XXI в., как работы в области иммунологии и разработка вакцин позволили 
ликвидировать черную оспу в XX в.Будущие задачи заключаются не только в поиске 
новых способов разносторонней характеристики пациента, но и в персонализации 
терапии, создании индивидуальных лекарственных схем и схем профилактики 
заболеваний. Вероятно, использование более релевантных моделей на базе культур 
клеток человека позволит не только изучать фармакодинамику препаратов, но и 
осуществлять персонифицированный подбор лекарственной терапии с учетом характера 
заболевания и комордибного фона пациента.

The article considers evolution of research and views on challenges and menaces 
of demographic aging process in the works of national and foreign scientists. 
The characteristics of this process in regions of the Russian Federation consist 
in special diversity of social economic, climatic, geographical and mental 
conditions in which demographic processes proceed. This determined availability 
of various types and stages of demographic aging in regions of the Russian 
Federation as well as opportunities to temper negative consequences of this 
process.
