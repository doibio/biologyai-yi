working in the public sector. Using a pre-defined algorithm, we estimated 
incident and prevalent cases of Parkinson's disease for the year 2016. The 
regional incidence rate, adjusted with Italian standard population data, was 
0.40 new cases/1000 person-years (0.41 in females, 0.39 in males). We estimated 
that 5550 subjects were affected by Parkinson's disease, leading to an 
age-adjusted prevalence rate of 5.42/1000 inhabitants. Prevalence and incidence 
increased with age and male gender. However, due to the longer life expectancy 
of females, the absolute number of prevalent cases was greater among females. 
The heterogeneity of spatial distribution of disease was high. A considerable 
proportion of prevalent cases was hospitalized in 2016. The most recurrent 
reasons for hospitalization episodes were disorders related to the nervous 
system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue apparatus. The study findings support the feasibility of 
future epidemiological studies of Parkinson's disease with administrative data 
as well as the need for an integrative care pathway for the patients with 
Parkinson's disease.

Background and purpose - Fracture of the ulnar styloid process (USP) is common 
in children in connection with distal radius fracture. The long-term morbidity 
of USP non-union following a childhood distal radius fracture is unclear. We 
evaluated long-term clinical and radiographic findings of USP non-union. 
Patients and methods - All 208 children (< 16 years) who had suffered from 
distal radius fracture with or without a diagnosed concomitant ulnar fracture 
during 1992-1999 in the study institution were invited to follow-up at mean of 
11 years (9-15) after the injury. Radiographs of both wrists of all 139 
participants (67%) were taken; 22 patients showed USP non-union and they made up 
the study population. Distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability, decreased 
range of motion (ROM), and weakened grip strength as compared with the uninjured 
side were the main functional outcomes. Elements of the "Disability of Arm, 
Shoulder and Hand" questionnaire were used for subjective symptoms. Results - 
The rate of USP non-union following childhood distal forearm fracture was 16% 
(22/139) and only 9 of the ulnar styloid fractures were visible in the 
radiographs primarily. At follow-up wrist flexion-extension ROM and ulnar and 
radial deviation ranges did not differ between the injured and uninjured sides. 
Grip strengths were similar. 6 patients reported pain during exercise. 7 had 
ulna minus (mean 2.3 mm) but none showed degenerative radiographic findings. 
Interpretation - The long-term clinical results of USP non-union following a 
childhood wrist fracture were good. However, one-third of the patients with USP 
non-union had ulnar shortening, which may predispose them to degenerative 
processes later in life.

BACKGROUND: The IMACS Registry compiles and analyzes worldwide data from 
patients undergoing implantation of durable left ventricular assist devices.
METHODS: Data encompassing 16,286 LVAD recipients from 4 collectives and 24 
individual hospitals was collected and analyzed. In this 3rd annual report we 
compare and contrast outcomes, adverse events and risks factors between axial 
flow and centrifugal flow device recipients.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the baseline characteristics of 
axial vs centrifugal flow LVAD recipients. Survival was similar between pump 
types. INTERMACS profile 1-3 constitute 85% of implants. A survival gap persists 
in destination therapy compared to bridge patients. RVAD need and delay impact 
survival dramatically. Centrifugal flow outperforms axial flow recipients in 
regards to GI bleeding and freedom from hemocompatibility related adverse 
events. No significant difference in the actuarial freedom from all strokes or 
either stroke subtype (hemorrhagic or ischemic) was seen among the two types of 
pumps. New end points to guide decision making are proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a transition from axial to centrifugal flow with 
four-year survival that approximates 60%. A high frequency of adverse events 
remains an impediment to the wider adoption of these technologies. In the 
future, composite study endpoints examining life quality and adverse events 
beyond survival may help in shared decision making prior to MCS implant, and may 
provide the requisite data to support extension of MCS therapy into the lesser 
ill heart failure population.

BACKGROUND: Age of onset of multimorbidity and its prevalence are well 
documented. However, its contribution to inequalities in life expectancy has yet 
to be quantified.
METHODS: A cohort of 1.1 million English people aged 45 and older were followed 
up from 2001 to 2010. Multimorbidity was defined as having 2 or more of 30 major 
chronic diseases. Multi-state models were used to estimate years spent healthy 
and with multimorbidity, stratified by sex, smoking status and quintiles of 
small-area deprivation.
RESULTS: Unequal rates of multimorbidity onset and subsequent survival 
contributed to higher life expectancy at age 65 for the least (Q1) compared with 
most (Q5) deprived: there was a 2-year gap in healthy life expectancy for men 
[Q1: 7.7 years (95% confidence interval: 6.4-8.5) vs Q5: 5.4 (4.4-6.0)] and a 
3-year gap for women [Q1: 8.6 (7.5-9.4) vs Q5: 5.9 (4.8-6.4)]; a 1-year gap in 
life expectancy with multimorbidity for men [Q1: 10.4 (9.9-11.2) vs Q5: 9.1 
(8.7-9.6)] but none for women [Q1: 11.6 (11.1-12.4) vs Q5: 11.5 (11.1-12.2)]. 
Inequalities were attenuated but not fully attributable to socio-economic 
differences in smoking prevalence: multimorbidity onset was latest for never 
smokers and subsequent survival was longer for never and ex smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between social disadvantage and multimorbidity is 
complex. By quantifying socio-demographic and smoking-related contributions to 
multimorbidity onset and subsequent survival, we provide evidence for more 
equitable allocation of prevention and health-care resources to meet local 
needs.

According to a recent study, stopping the prescription of TNF inhibitors is a 
cost-effective decision at various willingness-to-accept thresholds. 
Discontinuing the prescription of the drug may lead to a minor loss in health - 
expressed in quality adjusted life years - but results in significant societal 
savings. In our commentary, we stress that willingness-to-pay thresholds should 
not be completely replaced by the willingness-to-accept threshold, also when it 
concerns health losses. Loss aversion can be viewed as either a relevant 
societal phenomenon or an irrationality that should not guide decision making.

OBJECTIVE: Causes of morbidity and mortality of people living with HIV are 
changing with access to antiretroviral therapy and increased life expectancy. 
Age-related data on comorbidities and their impact on mortality in sub-Saharan 
Africa are scarce.
DESIGN: This prospective analysis evaluated comorbidities, assessed by means of 
International Classification of Diseases and Related Health problems 10th 
revision codes and clinical variables, derived from data collected from the 
Kilombero & Ulanga antiretroviral cohort of people living with HIV in rural 
Tanzania.
METHODS: We calculated prevalences and incidences of comorbidities in patients 
enrolled from 2013 to 2017 and evaluated their association with a combined 
endpoint of death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) in various age groups (15-29, 
30-49 and ≥50 years) using Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Of 1622 patients [65% females, median age 38 years (interquartile range 
31-46)], 11% were at least 50 years. During a median follow-up of 22.1 months 
(interquartile range 10.6-37.3), 48 (2.9%) patients died and 306 (18.9%) were 
LTFU. Anaemia was the most prevalent comorbidity (66.3%) irrespective of age and 
was associated with increased mortality/LTFU [hazard ratios 2.02 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.57-2.60); P < 0.001]. In patients aged at least 50 years, 
arterial hypertension was highly prevalent (43.8%), but not associated with 
mortality/LTFU [hazard ratios 1.04 (95% CI 0.56-1.93), P = 0.9]. Undernutrition 
ranged from 25.5% in the youngest to 29.1% in the oldest age group and 
contributed to mortality/LTFU [hazard ratios 2.24 (95% CI 1.65-3.04); 
P < 0.001]. Prevalence of tuberculosis was 21.4% with hazard ratios of 2.54 (95% 
CI 1.72-3.75, P < 0.001) for mortality/LTFU.
CONCLUSION: We show that anaemia, arterial hypertension and undernutrition are 
the most relevant comorbidities with different age-associated frequencies and 
impact on death/LTFU in this population.

OBJECTIVE: Most healthcare providers are reluctant to use health apps for 
healthcare because there is no rigorous way of choosing the best app for their 
patient or consumer. Accordingly, we developed a new method of app selection 
that fully considers target users' needs. This study verified whether health 
apps selected based on target users' needs can influence health-related factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized control trial of women with 
dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome using App A (the best app selected using 
the new method) and App B (the app with the highest number of users worldwide). 
The intervention was performed over 4 months to include at least 3 menstrual 
cycles.
RESULTS: Sixty-one app users completed the 16-week intervention. While users 
rated both apps as higher in quality than previously used menstrual apps, only 
App A users showed significant improvements in overall satisfaction, app outcome 
expectancy, the number of days with records, app social influence, intent to 
recommend, and the possibility of behavioral or cognitive changes in their 
symptom management. The number of menus used increased over time. While the app 
self-efficacy and the number of relief methods did not significantly differ 
between groups, they still showed an increase in App A users.
CONCLUSIONS: When a menstrual app reflected users' needs, they recorded their 
symptoms more often and reported higher app quality, satisfaction, and intention 
to recommend. This study can not only benefit the selection of menstrual apps, 
but also confirm that mobile health apps can improve health-related factors.

Food-borne and water-borne diseases under climate change in low- and 
middle-income countries: Further efforts needed for reducing environmental 
health exposure risks.

This paper provides a view of the major facts and figures related to infectious 
diseases with a focus on food-borne and water-borne diseases and their link with 
environmental factors and climate change. The global burden of food-borne 
diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization 
at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this 
burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per 
population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia 
and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning 
and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne 
diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of 
infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income 
countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious 
diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate 
change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for 
both food-borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and 
Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate 
the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) 
improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a 
significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged 
children. There is a need to better anticipate the impacts of climate change on 
infectious diseases and fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and 
multi-sectoral collaborations for integrated interventions at schools, community 
and household levels. The paper calls for giving priority to improving the 
environmental conditions affecting food-borne and water-borne infectious 
diseases under climate change.

OBJECTIVE: Almost two-thirds of patients with major depressive disorder do not 
achieve remission with initial treatments. Thus, identifying and providing 
effective, feasible, and safe "next-step" treatments are clinical imperatives. 
This study explores patient baseline features that might help clinicians select 
between commonly used next-step treatments.
METHODS: The authors used data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
Augmentation and Switching Treatments for Improving Depression Outcomes (VAST-D) 
study, a multisite, randomized, single-blind trial of 1,522 Veterans Health 
Administration patients who did not have an adequate response to at least one 
course of antidepressant treatment meeting minimal standards for dosage and 
duration. For 12 weeks, participants received one of three possible next-step 
treatments: switch to another antidepressant-sustained-release bupropion; 
combination with another antidepressant-sustained-release bupropion; or 
augmentation with an antipsychotic-aripiprazole. Life table regression models 
were used to identify baseline characteristics associated with remission overall 
(general predictors) and their interaction with remission among the three 
treatment groups (moderators).
RESULTS: Remission was more likely for individuals who were employed, less 
severely and chronically depressed, less anxious, not experiencing complicated 
grief symptoms, did not experience childhood adversity, and had better quality 
of life and positive mental health. Two features suggested specific next-step 
treatment selections: age ≥65 years (for whom augmentation with aripiprazole was 
more effective than switch to bupropion) and severe mixed hypomanic symptoms 
(for which augmentation with aripiprazole and combination with bupropion were 
more effective than switch to bupropion).
CONCLUSIONS: If replicated, these preliminary findings could help clinicians 
determine which patients with depression requiring next-step treatment will 
benefit most from a specific augmentation, combination, or switching strategy.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of a surgeon 
to predict survival of a total hip replacement (THR) based on the patient's 
diagnosis, demographics, postoperative activity level and the surgical 
technique.
METHODS: 4 experienced hip surgeons were asked to predict the longevity of 131 
Charnley THRs, performed by the senior author (GH) 22-35 years ago, by providing 
them with pre- and postoperative radiographs, and data concerning patient's 
diagnosis, demographics, postoperative activity level and the surgical 
technique. This process was repeated 3 months later.
RESULTS: There was only a slight agreement between the majority of the 
predictions and actual outcome. The inter-observer agreement was also slight and 
intra-observer agreement ranged from slight to moderate.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed that surgeons are unable to determine the life 
expectancy of the implants of a THR, based on the aforementioned data, because 
there are other non-identified factors that affect the survivorship of a THR. 
For this reason, regular follow-up remains the safest way to evaluate patients' 
clinical picture and the evolution of radiographic changes, if there are any, in 
order to accurately advise patients and decide on the appropriate time for 
revision.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the impact of obesity on premature mortality is 
critical, as obesity has become a global health issue.
OBJECTIVE: To contrast the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and 
premature death (all-cause; circulatory causes) in New York State (USA) and 
Northern Sweden.
METHODS: Baseline data were obtained between 1989 and 1999 via questionnaires 
(USA) and health exams (Sweden), with mortality data from health departments, 
public sources (USA) and the Swedish Death Register. Premature death was death 
before life expectancy based on sex and year of birth. Within country and sex, 
time to premature death was compared across BMI groups (18.5-24.9 kg/m2 
(reference), 25-29.9 kg/m2, 30.0-34.9 kg/m2, ≥35.0 kg/m2) using Proportional 
Hazards regression. Absolute risk (deaths/100,000 person-years) was compared for 
the same stratifications among nonsmokers.
RESULTS: 60,600 Swedish (47.8% male) and 31,198 US subjects (47.7% male) were 
included. Swedish males with BMI≥30 had increased hazards (HR) of all-cause 
premature death relative to BMI 18.5-24.9 (BMI 30-34.9, HR = 1.71 (95% CI: 1.44, 
2.02); BMI≥35, HR = 2.89 (2.16, 3.88)). BMI≥25 had increased hazards of 
premature circulatory death (BMI 25-29.9, HR = 1.66 (1.32, 2.08); BMI 30-34.9, 
HR = 3.02 (2.26, 4.03); BMI≥35, HR = 4.91 (3.05, 7.90)). Among US males, only 
BMI≥35 had increased hazards of all-cause death (HR = 1.63 (1.25, 2.14)), while 
BMI 30-34.9 (HR = 1.83 (1.20, 2.79)) and BMI≥35 (HR = 3.18 (1.96, 5.15)) had 
increased hazards for circulatory death. Swedish females showed elevated hazards 
with BMI≥30 for all-cause (BMI 30-34.9, HR = 1.42 (1.18, 1.71) and BMI≥35, HR = 
1.61 (1.21, 2.15) and with BMI≥35 (HR = 3.11 (1.72, 5.63)) for circulatory 
death. For US women, increased hazards were observed among BMI≥35 (HR = 2.10 
(1.60, 2.76) for all-cause and circulatory HR = 3.04 (1.75, 5.30)). Swedish 
males with BMI≥35 had the highest absolute risk of premature death (762/100,000 
person-years).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a markedly increased risk of premature 
death associated with increasing BMI among Swedish males, a pattern not 
duplicated among females.

PURPOSE: Given limited data available on long-term outcomes in 22q11.2 deletion 
syndrome (22q11.2DS), we investigated mortality risk in adults with this 
microdeletion syndrome.
METHODS: We studied 309 well-characterized adults (age ≥17 years) with 22q11.2DS 
and their 1014 unaffected parents and siblings, using a prospective case-control 
design. We used Cox proportional hazards regression modeling and Kaplan-Meier 
curves to investigate effects of the 22q11.2 deletion and its associated 
features on all-cause mortality and survival.
RESULTS: The 22q11.2 deletion (hazard ratio [HR] 8.86, 95% CI 2.87-27.37) and 
major congenital heart disease (CHD; HR 5.03, 95% CI 2.27-11.17), but not 
intellectual disability or psychotic illness, were significant independent 
predictors of mortality for adults with 22q11.2DS compared with their siblings. 
Amongst those with 22q11.2DS, there were 31 deaths that occurred at a median age 
of 46.4 (range 18.1-68.6) years; a substantial minority had outlived both 
parents. Probability of survival to age 45 years was approximately 72% for those 
with major CHD, and 95% for those with no major CHD (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: For adults with 22q11.2DS, the 22q11.2 deletion and more severe 
forms of CHD both contribute to a lower life expectancy than family-based 
expectations. The results have implications for genetic counseling and 
anticipatory care.

Oncological interventions in thoracic cavity have some important problems such 
as choice of correct operative approaches depending on the tumor, size, 
extension, and location. In sarcoma surgery, wide resection should be aimed for 
the curative surgery. Purpose of this study was to evaluate pre-operative 
planning of patient-specific thoracic cavity model made by multidisciplinary 
surgeon team for complex tumor mass for oncological procedures. Patient's scans 
showed a large mass encroaching on the mediastinum and heart, with erosion of 
the adjacent ribs and vertebral column. Individual model of this case with 
thoracic tumor was reconstructed from the DICOM file of the CT data. Surgical 
team including six interdisciplinary surgeons explained their surgical 
experience of the use of 3D life-size individual model for guiding surgical 
treatment. Before patients consented to surgery, each surgeon explained the 
surgical procedure and perioperative risks to her. A questionnaire was applied 
to 10 surgical residents to evaluate the 3D model's perception. 3D model scans 
were useful in determining the site of the lesion, the exact size, extension, 
attachment to the surrounding structures such as lung, aorta, vertebral column, 
or vascular involvement, the number of involved ribs, whether the diaphragm was 
involved also in which order surgeons in the team enter the surgery. 3D model's 
perception was detected statistical significance as < 0.05. Viewing thoracic 
cavity with tumor model was more efficient than CT imaging. This case was 
surgically difficult as it included vital structures such as the mediastinal 
vessels, aorta, ribs, sternum, and vertebral bodies. A difficult pathology for 
which 3D model has already been explored to assist anatomic visualization was 
mediastinal osteosarcoma of the chest wall, diaphragm, and the vertebral column. 
The study helped to establish safe surgical line wherever the healthy tissue was 
retained and enabled osteotomy of the affected spinal corpus vertically with 
posterior-anterior direction by preserving the spinal cord and the spinal nerves 
above and distal the tumor. 3D tumor model helps to transfer complex anatomical 
information to surgeons, provide guidance in the pre-operative planning stage, 
for intra-operative navigation and for surgical collaboration purposes. Total 
radical excision of the bone tumor and reconstructions of remaining structures 
using life-size model was the key for successful treatment and better outcomes. 
The recent explosion in popularity of 3D printing is a testament to the promise 
of this technology and its profound utility in orthopedic oncological surgery.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a highly aggressive skin neuroendocrine tumor with 
early malignant potential. Metastasis was previously considered a sign of 
unresectability and short life expectancy. This report describes an isolated 
metastasis to the liver from Merkel cell carcinoma of the left frontotemporal 
area and an effective treatment that may meaningfully prolong life.

and Sustainable New Vaccine Introduction.

Africa has the highest incidence of mortality caused by infectious diseases, and 
remarkably does not have the capacity to manufacture vaccines that are essential 
to reduce mortality, improving life expectancy, and promoting economic growth. 
GAVI has significantly helped introduction of new vaccines in Africa but its 
sustainability is questionable, and new vaccines introduction post-graduation is 
rare. Conversely, Africa with its high population and economy growth is an 
increasing potential market for vaccines. This study aimed to investigate how 
investment for vaccine production in Africa could be triggered and in which way 
it could be affordable to most African governments or investors. The 
investigation was based on a literature review and supplemented by online 
questionnaires directed to global vaccine stakeholders, African governments and 
regulatory authorities. In-depth interviews with experts in manufacturing 
capacity implementation and regulatory capacity building in Africa complemented 
the study. We also developed business plan scenarios including facility costs 
calculations and a possible investment plan based on expert opinions and 
publicly available information from pertinent sources. We saw that, governments 
in Africa, show interest in vaccine production establishments but only with 
external support for investment. The common regulatory functionality gap was the 
quality control laboratories to test vaccine lots before regulatory release. The 
global vaccine stakeholders showed less preference in investment for vaccine 
production establishment in Africa. The diverse political ambitions among 
African governments make it difficult to predict and access the market, a 
prerequisite for competitive production. A feasible solution could be a small 
production facility that would use technologies with high yield at low costs of 
goods to cover the regional needs. A respective antigen production facility is 
estimated to cost USD 25 Million, an affordable dimension for investors or 
interested African governments. Attractiveness for the African market is deemed 
to be high when targeting diseases almost exclusively for Africa (e.g., malaria 
or invasive non-typhoidal salmonella). With a smart 5 years tangible 
implementation plan, marketing agreements within existing regional 
collaborations and with a strong political will, an African government alone or 
together with an investor could convince global vaccine stakeholders and 
investors to support.

Life expectancy in the US is on the decline. Mental health issues associated 
with opioid abuse and suicide have been implicated for this decline 
necessitating new approaches and procedures. While Public Health 3.0 provides a 
call to action for stakeholders to work closely together to address such complex 
problems as these, less attention has been given to engaging and supporting the 
most important stakeholders and primary producers of health within the US: 
families and households. The idea that health begins at home is discussed from 
the perspective of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels. Primary 
prevention where research provides evidence for the role of the family in 
healthy child development. Secondary and tertiary prevention where research 
offers evidence for the role of the family in caregiving. Despite this evidence, 
greater focus and attention must be placed on the family at all prevention 
levels as an often overlooked setting of public health practice and level of 
influence. Prevention across all levels is enhanced as public health 
practitioners think family when designing and implementing public health policy. 
Four family impact principles are presented to help guide planning and 
implementation decisions to nourish family engagement.

INTRODUCTION: As average life-expectancy increases, a sufficient hearing 
rehabilitation for elderly patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural 
hearing loss becomes more important. Cochlear implantation is a relatively safe 
surgical procedure also for elderly patients, the higher risk is caused by 
general anesthesia. We report on four patients who underwent cochlear 
implantation under local anesthesia.
METHODS: After detailed preoperative examinations (audiological tests, imaging, 
genetic tests, evaluation of motivation and compliance of the patient), four 
patient with severe-to-profound hearing loss were selected for cochlear 
implantation under local anesthesia. For the electrode insertion, we used the 
posterior suprameatal approach technique. Pre- and postoperative pure tone 
audiometry and speech-perception tests were conducted to prove the success of 
the procedure.
RESULTS: The mentioned technique was applied; the average length of the 
operation was 52 min. The intraoperative measurements showed normal impedance 
and normal neuronal response telemetry, all the patients had sound experience 
during the intraoperative examination of the engineer. No complications were 
observed. The postoperative audiological tests showed a significant increase in 
the hearing perception.
CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation under local anesthesia is a safe and fast 
procedure for elderly patients. The intraoperative sound experience can give an 
extra motivation in the postoperative rehabilitation. Our results prove that by 
carefully selected elderly patients cochlear implantation can assure a 
significant increase in speech perception. We can establish that the new 
posterior suprameatal approach technique combined with local anesthesia presents 
a viable future option for those patients who were inoperable beforehand because 
of high risks of general anesthesia.

BACKGROUND: The very low physical fitness levels of people with intellectual 
disabilities (ID) may influence their life expectancy. Therefore, we 
investigated the predictive value of physical fitness for survival in older 
adults with intellectual disabilities.
METHOD: In the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disabilities (HA-ID) study,the 
physical fitness levels of 900 older adults (≥50 years; 61.5 ± 8.1 years) were 
measured at baseline. All-cause mortality was collected over a 5-year 
follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the 
association between each physical fitness test and survival, adjusted for age, 
sex, level of ID, and Down syndrome.
RESULTS: The physical fitness components that were independently predictive for 
survival were manual dexterity (HR = 0.96 [0.94-0.98]), visual reaction time 
(HR = 1.57 [1.28-1.94]), balance (HR = 0.97 [0.95-0.99]), comfortable gait speed 
(HR = 0.65 [0.54-0.78]), fast gait speed (HR = 0.81 [0.72-0.91]), grip strength 
(HR = 0.97 [0.94-0.99]) and cardiorespiratory fitness (HR = 0.997 
[0.995-0.999]), with a better physical fitness showing a lower mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: We showed for the first time that physical fitness was independently 
associated with survival in older adults with intellectual disabilities. 
Improving and maintaining physical fitness must become an essential part of care 
and support for this population.

The lipidation of peptide drugs is one strategy to obtain extended half-lives, 
enabling once-daily or even less frequent injections for patients. The half-life 
extension results from a combination of self-association and association with 
human serum albumin (albumin). The self-association and association with albumin 
of two insulin analogues, insulin detemir and insulin degludec, were 
investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic light scattering 
(DLS) in phenolic buffers. Detemir shows concentration-dependent 
self-association, with an equilibrium between hexamer, dihexamer, trihexamer and 
larger species, while degludec appears as a dihexamer independent of 
concentration. The solution structure of the detemir trihexamer has a bent 
shape. The stoichiometry of the association with albumin was studied using DLS. 
For albumin-detemir the molar stoichiometry was determined to be 1:6 
(albumin:detemir ratio) and for albumin-degludec it was between 1:6 and 1:12 
(albumin:degludec ratio). Batch SAXS measurements of a 1:6 albumin:detemir 
concentration series revealed a concentration dependence of complex formation. 
The data allowed the modelling of a complex between albumin and a detemir 
hexamer and a complex consisting of two albumins binding to opposite ends of a 
detemir dihexamer. Measurements of size-exclusion chromatography coupled to SAXS 
revealed a complex between a degludec dihexamer and albumin. Based on the 
results, equilibria for the albumin-detemir and albumin-degludec mixtures are 
proposed.

Older Adult Perspectives Toward Surveillance Colonoscopy: A Qualitative Study.

GOALS AND BACKGROUND: Surveillance colonoscopy is the most common indication for 
colonoscopy in older adults, yet factors involved in patient decision-making are 
poorly defined. We sought to understand general perspectives of older adults 
toward surveillance colonoscopy.
STUDY: We conducted 2 in-person, 90-minute semistructured focus groups at a 
rural, tertiary care, academic facility with a total of 20 English-speaking 
participants with a history of colon polyps. We also obtained baseline 
characteristics including information to calculate life expectancy using the 
Schonberg Index, a validated measure of 5-year and 9-year mortality.
RESULTS: Participant ages ranged from 75 to 89, 67% were female, and 61% had a 
life expectancy of ≤9 years. Major common themes included reasons for and 
against getting a surveillance colonoscopy, and preferences and opinions 
surrounding discontinuing surveillance. Fear of cancer, trust in the colonoscopy 
procedure, and provider advice played prominent roles in patient decisions to 
return for surveillance. Most felt they should make screening decisions with 
input from providers, and that providers should engage them in these decisions 
and base recommendations on their patients' personal history and health, not on 
how old they are or on actuarial data.
CONCLUSIONS: This small, qualitative study suggests that older adults familiar 
with surveillance colonoscopy prefer patient-centered decision-making on when to 
discontinue testing and want support and information from providers when making 
choices. The evidence also suggests that participants value provider 
communication and trust their advice. Future work will use this information to 
create a larger patient survey on attitudes and beliefs toward surveillance 
colonoscopy.

Performance of Saturated Riparian Buffers in Iowa, USA.

Jaynes DB, Isenhart TM.

Nitrate from artificial drainage pipes (tiles) underlying agricultural fields is 
a major source of reactive N, especially NO, in surface waters. A novel approach 
for reducing NO loss is to intercept a field tile where it crosses a riparian 
buffer and divert a fraction of the flow as shallow groundwater within the 
buffer. This practice is called a saturated riparian buffer (SRB), and although 
it is promising, little data on the performance of the practice is available. 
This research investigated the effectiveness of SRBs in removing NO at six sites 
installed across Iowa, resulting in a total of 17 site-years. Water flow and NO 
in the tile outlets, diverted into the buffers, and NO concentration changes 
within the buffers were monitored throughout the year at each site. Results 
showed that all the SRBs were effective in removing NO from the tile outlet, 
with the average annual NO load removal ranging from 13 to 179 kg N for drainage 
areas ranging from 3.4 to 40.5 ha. This is NO that would have otherwise 
discharged directly into the adjoining streams. The annual removal 
effectiveness, which is the total NO removed in the SRB divided by the total NO 
draining from the field, ranged from 8 to 84%. This corresponds to an average 
removal rate of 0.040 g N m d with a range of 0.004 to 0.164 g N m d. Assuming a 
40-yr life expectancy for the structure and a 4% discount rate, we computed a 
mean equal annual cost for SRBs of US$213.83. Given the average annual removal 
of 73 kg for all site-years, this cost equates to $2.94 kg N removed, which is 
very competitive with other field-edge practices such as denitrification 
bioreactors and constructed wetlands. Thus, SRBs continue to be a promising 
practice for NO removal in tile-drained landscapes.
