antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs), antibiotic 
prescriptions in primary care in England increased by 4.1% from 2010 to 2013. 
C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care tests (POCT), for example, the Afinion™ 
Analyzer (Alere Ltd, Stockport, UK) device, are widely used in several countries 
in the European Union. Studies suggest that CRP POCT use, either alone or in 
combination with communication training, reduces antibiotic prescribing and 
improves quality of life for patients presenting with RTI symptoms. The aim of 
this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CRP POCT for RTIs in primary 
care in England over 3 years for three different strategies of care compared to 
standard practice.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was carried out to compare the costs and 
benefits of three different strategies of CRP testing (GP plus CRP; practice 
nurse plus CRP; and GP plus CRP and communication training) for patients with 
RTI symptoms as defined by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guideline CG69, compared with current standard GP practice without CRP testing. 
Analysis consisted of a decision tree and Markov model to describe the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost per 100 patients, together with the 
number of antibiotic prescriptions and RTIs for each group.
RESULTS: Compared with current standard practice, the GP plus CRP and practice 
nurse plus CRP test strategies result in increased QALYs and reduced costs, 
while the GP plus CRP testing and communication training strategy is associated 
with increased costs and reduced QALYs. Additionally, all three CRP arms led to 
fewer antibiotic prescriptions and infections over 3 years.
CONCLUSION: The additional cost per patient of the CRP test is outweighed by the 
associated cost savings and QALY increment associated with a reduction in 
infections in the long term.

Bipolar disorder: role of immune-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative and 
nitrosative stress and tryptophan catabolites.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex disorder with a range of presentations. BD is 
defined by the presentation of symptoms of mania or depression, with 
classification dependent on patient/family reports and behavioural observations. 
Recent work has investigated the biological underpinnings of BD, highlighting 
the role played by increased immune-inflammatory activity, which is readily 
indicated by changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines or signalling, both centrally 
and systemically, e.g. increased interleukin-6 trans-signalling. Here, we review 
the recent data on immune-inflammatory pathways and cytokine changes in BD. Such 
changes are intimately linked to changes in oxidative and nitrosative stress 
(O&NS) and neuroregulatory tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), both centrally and 
peripherally. TRYCATs take tryptophan away from serotonin, N-acetylserotonin and 
melatonin synthesis, driving it down the TRYCAT pathway, predominantly as a 
result of the pro-inflammatory cytokine induction of indoleamine 
2,3-dioxygenase. This has led to an emerging biological perspective on the 
aetiology, course and treatment of BD. Such data also better integrates the 
numerous comorbidities associated with BD, including addiction, cardiovascular 
disorders and increased reporting of pain. Immune-inflammatory, O&NS and TRYCAT 
pathways are also likely to be relevant biological underpinnings to the 
significant decrease in life expectancy in BD.

Deep neck infections could have serious threats for life of patients, if not 
noticed adequately. Early diagnosis and correct treatment planning can save the 
patient's lives and prevent complications of disease extension and also surgical 
procedures that in some instances may be performed in an emergent situation with 
higher complication rates. Herein, we have studied 815 cases of deep neck 
abscesses and infections with especial consideration to treatment and prognosis. 
In a retrospective case review, we studied 815 cases admitted in our medical 
center from 1998 until the year 2013. Only patients with abscesses or infections 
deeper than superficial layer of deep cervical fascia were included in this 
study, based on the review of their medical records. From 815 cases (485 males 
and 330 females) surgery was indicated and performed in 428 cases and the rest 
were treated medically. In cases with dental infections as the etiologic factor, 
dental procedures were performed as early as possible (extraction in almost all 
cases). Tracheostomy was performed in five cases. All of the patients in medical 
treatment group and most of the surgically managed patients were discharged 
while were stable with relative or complete resolution of their symptoms. One of 
our patients, a 15 year old boy died with symptoms suggestive for mediastinitis 
and air way compromise. Early diagnosis and medical management can be effective 
in treating deep neck infections. Dental infections and also procedures are the 
major cause in our patients, although tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess also 
were important leading causes with almost equal numbers in our series. 
Extraction of the infected tooth as early as possible while medical treatment is 
continued can be very helpful. In some cases it may be necessary to perform 
surgical exploration of the neck more than once, and finally, malignant 
neoplasia, somewhere in the head and neck should be considered in some cases, as 
in one of our patients with left side submandibular abscess whose underlying 
disorder was tongue SCC with neck metastasis. Prognosis can be excellent in both 
medically and surgically managed groups if started and designed early and 
promptly.

gynecological cancer.

et Génétique Médical, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, 
Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: Lymphadenectomy is a frequent procedure for surgical staging of 
gynecological malignancies. Nevertheless, minor complications, such as lower 
limb lymphedema (LLL) and neurological complications (NCs), after pelvic and 
aorto-caval lymphadenectomy still remain underinvestigated. The present study 
considers short-term and long-term incidence and risk factors for LLL and NC in 
patients with gynecological cancer who underwent lymphadenectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2 different institutions, University of Turin and 
University of Lausanne, a total of 152 patients who received lymphadenectomy for 
endometrial, cervical, or ovarian cancer were retrospectively identified. During 
the follow-up, data about LLL and NC were collected by means of a questionnaire. 
Short-term and long-term incidence of LLL and NC was evaluated, and risk 
factors, such as age, body mass index, type of cancer, surgical approach, number 
and extension of the removed lymph nodes, presence of lymph node metastasis, and 
adjuvant treatments, were analyzed.
RESULTS: Short-term incidence of LLL and NC after lymphadenectomy was high (36%) 
and predictive of long-term persistence. Between the analyzed risk factors, 
number of removed lymph nodes and adjuvant radiotherapy were significantly 
associated with an increased incidence of minor complications (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Lower limb lymphedema and NC are more frequent than expected. They 
are related to the radicality of lymphadenectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy. They 
affect the quality of life of the patients treated for gynecological cancer and 
their perceptions of healing. Minor complications are commonly persistent and 
need a prompt diagnosis and a specialized management to improve their prognosis.

[Cancer treatment in elderly patients: evidence and clinical research].

[Article in Italian]

Repetto L, Luciani A.

In 2020 the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of cancer in people with 
more than 65 years will exceed 70% and 28% in ethnic minorities. The treatment 
of cancer in these populations is challenging for the oncologists due to 
socio-economic issues such as poverty, reduced access to the hospital care, 
level of education. The clinical pathway "diagnosis-treatment-cure", typical of 
the care of young patients has to be integrated in elderly patients with a more 
individualized treatment by means of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). 
IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) have the best predictive role in 
oncological setting and their impairment significantly correlate with overall 
survival, chemotherapy toxicities and thirty days postoperative morbidities. The 
CGA is universally accepted as the most appropriate instrument to analitically 
evaluate the age related problems of elderly patients. The role of CGA is 
crucial to identify geriatric issues not easily diagnosed, to predict treatment 
toxicities, functional or cognitive decline, post operative complications and to 
estimate life expectancy. The CGA items are predictive of severe toxicity, 
however it is not clearly established which are the best performers and the best 
cut-offs points. Today CGA is integrated with physical performance tests (the 
most widely used is the "time up and go" test) and laboratory assay of 
Interleukin 6 and D-Dimer that correlate with mortality and physical decline. 
There are few prospective studies that evaluated the role of CGA in treatment 
choice. The first is a phase II study in solid tumors, the second is a 
haematological trial on non Hodgkin lymphoma. The largest trial is a 571 
patients observational series that confirmed the role of CGA in decision making. 
The administration of CGA is time consuming and consequently some screening 
tools were developed. VES-13 is a 13 items tool that explores prevalently the 
functional status and the self reported health status. VES-13 showed a good 
sensibility (87.3%) but a low specificity (62%) with respect to CGA for the 
diagnosis of patients with disabilities. Overcash et al. proposed an abbreviated 
form of CGA using a reduced number of items of ADL, IADL, MMSE and GDS. There 
was a good correlation between complete and reduced scales (coefficient of 
correlation 0.8). G8 is a screening tool composed of 8 questions that explore 
functional, cognitive and nutritional status. The score with the best 
equilibrium between sensibility and specificity was 14 (sensibility 85% and 
specificity 65%). In the first observational trial age, hystotype, chemotherapy 
dose, haemoglobin (man: 11 g/dL; women: 10 g/dL), creatinine clearance less than 
34 mL/min (Jelliffe formula), earing problems, at least a fall in the last six 
months, walking problems, low social activity, were related to a major risk of 
toxicity; in another trial IADL, diastolic blood pressure, LDH and MAX2 index 
were predictive of haematological toxicity, while performance status, 
Mini-Mental Status score, Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score and MAX2 index 
were predictive of non haematological toxicity. Based on these parameters a 0-2 
score was developed. A recent "position article" of EORTC (European organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and SIOG analyzed the pro and the contra 
of the use of some indicators in elderly patients. The overall survival (OS) 
frequently used in classical clinical trial could give wrong messages as there 
are some competitive risks of death in elderly patients. Another important 
indicator is the disease specific survival (DSS). Concerning the design of 
clinical trials, a possible strategy is to enrol elderly patients without upper 
age limit and to plan stratification. An interesting trial design is the so 
called "extended trial" that allow to re-open the arm of a trial in which a too 
low number of older patients was enrolled.

IMPORTANCE: In vivo imaging of brain β-amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease, 
may assist in the clinical assessment of suspected Alzheimer disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of positron emission 
tomography imaging with flutemetamol injection labeled with radioactive fluorine 
18 to detect β-amyloid in the brain using neuropathologically determined 
neuritic plaque levels as the standard of truth.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Open-label multicenter imaging study that 
took place at dementia clinics, memory centers, and hospice centers in the 
United States and England from June 22, 2010, to November 23, 2011. Participants 
included terminally ill patients who were 55 years or older with a life 
expectancy of less than 1 year.
INTERVENTIONS: Flutemetamol injection labeled with radioactive fluorine 18 
(Vizamyl; GE Healthcare) administration followed by positron emission tomography 
imaging and subsequent brain donation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of flutemetamol 
injection labeled with radioactive fluorine 18 positron emission tomography 
imaging for brain β-amyloid. Images were reviewed without and with computed 
tomography scans and classified as positive or negative for β-amyloid by 5 
readers who were blind to patient information. In patients who died, 
neuropathologically determined neuritic plaque levels were used to confirm scan 
interpretations and determine sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: Of 176 patients with evaluable images, 68 patients (38%) died during 
the study, were autopsied, and had neuritic plaque levels determined; 25 brains 
(37%) were β-amyloid negative; and 43 brains (63%) were β-amyloid positive. 
Imaging was performed a mean of 3.5 months (range, 0 to 13 months) before death. 
Sensitivity without computed tomography was 81% to 93% (median, 88%). Median 
specificity was 88%, with 4 of 5 of the readers having specificity greater than 
80%. When scans were interpreted with computed tomography images, sensitivity 
and specificity improved for most readers but the differences were not 
significant. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.90. There were no 
clinically meaningful findings in safety parameters.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study showed that flutemetamol injection labeled 
with radioactive fluorine 18 was safe and had high sensitivity and specificity 
in an end-of-life population. In vivo detection of brain β-amyloid plaque 
density may increase diagnostic accuracy in cognitively impaired patients.

Prediction of life expectancy in individuals in the United Kingdom using current 
cohort tables.

Bowen-Jones D, Nwaneri C, Morris J.

This paper provides updated cohort tables of life expectancy for individuals in 
the United Kingdom. Using 2008-based projections from the UK Office for National 
Statistics (ONS) cohort and period expectation of life tables (the Ogden 
tables); predicted future life expectancies were calculated for quintiles of age 
from 0-90 years in men and women with mortality ratios between 100% and 1000%. 
Period tables have been included to illustrate the differences between period 
and cohort life expectancy in men and women at various ages. These tables are 
not intended to predict specific life expectancy in individuals but may indicate 
the mean life expectancy of a cohort of similarly affected people in the UK.

Can multi-attribute utility instruments adequately account for subjective 
well-being?

INTRODUCTION: The quality of life is included in cost utility analyses by 
weighting the relevant years of life by health state utilities. However, the 
utilities predicted by multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs) for this 
purpose do not correlate highly with the subjective well-being (SWB) of people 
experiencing the health states. This suggests that MAUIs may not take account of 
the SWB experienced by patients. This article explores an alternative 
hypothesis: that a failure of an MAUI to account for variation in SWB is 
primarily a result of the failure of its descriptive system to include the 
elements of health that determine SWB and that cannot therefore be included in 
assessment of the health state utility.
METHODS: Survey data are used to determine the extent to which 6 MAUIs with 
significantly different descriptive systems explain differences between the SWB 
of the healthy public and patients in 7 disease areas.
RESULTS: The EQ-5D-5L takes least account and AQoL-8D most account of SWB. 
AQoL-8D overpredicts the loss of SWB in 2 cases where hedonic adaptation is 
known to occur.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest that, to a large extent, utility can account for 
variation in SWB. The case for replacing utility with SWB in economic evaluation 
studies has arisen, in part, because elements of importance for SWB have been 
omitted from the descriptive systems of commonly used MAUIs.

BACKGROUND: Aphasia affects the ability to speak, comprehend spoken language, 
read and write. One third of stroke survivors experience aphasia. Evidence 
suggests that aphasia can continue to improve after the first few months with 
intensive speech and language therapy, which is frequently beyond what resources 
allow. The development of computer software for language practice provides an 
opportunity for self-managed therapy. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial 
will investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of a computerised approach 
to long-term aphasia therapy post stroke.
METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 285 adults with aphasia at least four months post 
stroke will be randomly allocated to either usual care, computerised 
intervention in addition to usual care or attention and activity control in 
addition to usual care. Those in the intervention group will receive six months 
of self-managed word finding practice on their home computer with monthly 
face-to-face support from a volunteer/assistant. Those in the attention control 
group will receive puzzle activities, supplemented by monthly telephone calls. 
Study delivery will be coordinated by 20 speech and language therapy departments 
across the United Kingdom. Outcome measures will be made at baseline, six, nine 
and 12 months after randomisation by blinded speech and language therapist 
assessors. Primary outcomes are the change in number of words (of personal 
relevance) named correctly at six months and improvement in functional 
conversation. Primary outcomes will be analysed using a Hochberg testing 
procedure. Significance will be declared if differences in both word retrieval 
and functional conversation at six months are significant at the 5% level, or if 
either comparison is significant at 2.5%. A cost utility analysis will be 
undertaken from the NHS and personal social service perspective. Differences 
between costs and quality-adjusted life years in the three groups will be 
described and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio will be calculated. 
Treatment fidelity will be monitored.
DISCUSSION: This is the first fully powered trial of the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of computerised aphasia therapy. Specific challenges in designing 
the protocol are considered.

Early-onset scoliosis: current treatment.

Early-onset scoliosis, which appears before the age of 10, can be due to 
congenital vertebral anomalies, neuromuscular diseases, scoliosis-associated 
syndromes, or idiopathic causes. It can have serious consequences for lung 
development and significantly reduce the life expectancy compared to adolescent 
scoliosis. Extended posterior fusion must be avoided to prevent the crankshaft 
phenomenon, uneven growth of the trunk and especially restrictive lung disease. 
Conservative (non-surgical) treatment is used first. If this fails, fusionless 
surgery can be performed to delay the final fusion procedure until the patient 
is older. The gold standard delaying surgical treatment is the implantation of 
growing rods as described by Moe and colleagues in the mid-1980s. These rods, 
which are lengthened during short surgical procedures at regular intervals, curb 
the scoliosis progression until the patient reaches an age where fusion can be 
performed. Knowledge of this technique and its complications has led to several 
mechanical improvements being made, namely use of rods that can be distracted 
magnetically on an outpatient basis, without the need for anesthesia. Devices 
based on the same principle have been designed that preferentially attach to the 
ribs to specifically address chest wall and spine dysplasia. The second category 
of surgical devices consists of rods used to guide spinal growth that do not 
require repeated surgical procedures. The third type of fusionless surgical 
treatment involves slowing the growth of the scoliosis convexity to help reduce 
the Cobb angle. The indications are constantly changing. Improvements in 
surgical techniques and greater surgeon experience may help to reduce the number 
of complications and make this lengthy treatment acceptable to patients and 
their family. Long-term effects of surgery on the Cobb angle have not been 
compared to those involving conservative "delaying" treatments. Because the 
latter has fewer complications associated with it than surgery, it should be the 
first-line treatment for most cases of early-onset scoliosis.

Cervico-isthmic pregnancy is a rare and potentially life-threatening form of 
ectopic gestation in which the blastocyst implants in the uterine 
cervico-isthmus between the histological and anatomical internal os, followed by 
subsequent extension to the lower uterine segment. Early diagnosis may allow a 
conservative therapeutic approach that avoids catastrophic hemorrhage requiring 
hysterectomy. Here we report the case of a 43-year-old primigravida woman whose 
cervico-isthmic pregnancy complicated by massive hematometra was diagnosed at 6

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, 
and radiographic progression through 2 years of treatment with intravenous (IV) 
golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) in an open-label extension of a phase III 
trial of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite MTX therapy.
METHODS: In the phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
GO-FURTHER trial, 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to 
intravenous golimumab 2 mg/kg plus MTX (Group 1) or placebo plus MTX (Group 2) 
at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks thereafter; placebo patients crossed over 
to golimumab at week 16 (early escape) or week 24 (crossover). The final 
golimumab infusion was at week 100. Assessments included American College of 
Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28-joint 
count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP), 
physical function and quality of life measures, and changes in the modified 
Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Safety was monitored through week 112.
RESULTS: In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued treatment through week 100, 
and 68.1%, 43.8%, and 23.5% had an ACR20/50/70 response, respectively, at week 
100. Clinical response and improvements in physical function and quality of life 
were generally maintained from week 24 through 2 years. Mean change from 
baseline to week 100 in SHS score was 0.74 in Group 1 and 2.10 in Group 2 
(P = 0.005); progression from week 52 to week 100 was clinically insignificant 
in both groups. A total of 481 patients completed the safety followup through 
week 112; 79.1% had an adverse event, and 18.2% had a serious adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Clinical response to IV golimumab plus MTX was maintained through 
week 100. Radiographic progression following golimumab treatment was clinically 
insignificant between week 52 and week 100. No unexpected adverse events 
occurred through week 112, and the safety profile was consistent with anti-tumor 
necrosis factor therapy.

BACKGROUND: Biliary stricture without mass presents diagnostic and therapeutic 
challenges because the poor sensitivity of the available tests and significant 
mortality and cost with operation.
METHODS: A decision model was developed to analyze costs and survival for 1) 
investigation first with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration, 
2) investigation first with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) and brushing, or 3) surgery on every patient. The average age of someone 
with a biliary stricture was found to be 62-y-old and the rate of cancer was 
55%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated based on the 
change in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (US$) between the 
different options, with a threshold of $150,000 to determine the most 
cost-effective strategy. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic-sensitivity 
analysis were performed to validate the model.
RESULTS: ERCP results in 9.05 QALYs and a cost of $34,685.11 for a 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $3832.33. EUS results in an incremental increase in 
0.13 QALYs and $2773.69 for an ICER of $20,840.28 per QALY gained. Surgery 
resulted in a decrease of 1.37 QALYs and increased cost of $14,323.94 
(ICER-$10,490.53). These trends remained within most sensitivity analyses; 
however, ERCP and EUS were dependent on the test sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a biliary stricture with no mass, the most 
cost-effective strategy is to investigate the patient before operation. The 
choice between EUS and ERCP should be institutionally dependent, with EUS being 
more cost-effective in our base case analysis.

OBJECTIVE: Although analgesic approaches targeting nerve growth factor (NGF) for 
the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) pain remain of clinical interest, 
neurophysiological mechanisms by which NGF contribute to OA pain remain unclear. 
We investigated the impact of local elevation of knee joint NGF on knee joint, 
vs remote (hindpaw), evoked responses of spinal neurones in a rodent model of OA 
pain.
DESIGN: In vivo spinal electrophysiology was carried out in anaesthetised rats 
with established pain behaviour and joint pathology following intra-articular 
injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA), vs injection of saline. Neuronal 
responses to knee joint extension and flexion, mechanical punctate stimulation 
of the peripheral receptive fields over the knee and at a remote site 
(ipsilateral hind paw) were studied before, and following, intra-articular 
injection of NGF (10 μg/50 μl) or saline.
RESULTS: MIA-injected rats exhibited significant local (knee joint) and remote 
(lowered hindpaw withdrawal thresholds) changes in pain behaviour, and joint 
pathology. Intra-articular injection of NGF significantly (P < 0.05) increased 
knee extension-evoked firing of spinal neurones and the size of the peripheral 
receptive fields of spinal neurones (100% increase) over the knee joint in MIA 
rats, compared to controls. Intra-articular NGF injection did not significantly 
alter responses of spinal neurones following noxious stimulation of the 
ipsilateral hind paw in MIA-injected rats.
CONCLUSION: The facilitatory effects of intra-articular injection of NGF on 
spinal neurones receiving input from the knee joint provide a mechanistic basis 
for NGF mediated augmentation of OA knee pain, however additional mechanisms may 
contribute to the spread of pain to remote sites.

BACKGROUND: In U.S. women, lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.37%, but some 
women are at a substantially lower or higher risk than this average.
METHODS: We have characterized the distribution of lifetime risk in the general 
population. Published data on the relative risks and their variances for five 
well-accepted risk and protective factors for ovarian cancer, oral contraceptive 
use, parity, tubal ligation, endometriosis, and first-degree family history of 
ovarian cancer in conjunction with a genetic risk score using genome-wide 
significant common, low penetrance variants were used. The joint distribution of 
these factors (i.e., risk/protective factor profiles) was derived using control 
data from four U.S. population-based studies, providing a broad representation 
of women in the United States.
RESULTS: A total of 214 combinations of risk/protective factors were observed, 
and the lifetime risk estimates ranged from 0.35% [95% confidence interval (CI), 
0.29-0.42] to 8.78% (95% CI, 7.10-10.9). Among women with lifetime risk ranging 
from 4% to 9%, 73% had no family history of ovarian cancer; most of these women 
had a self-reported history of endometriosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Profiles including the known modifiable protective factors of oral 
contraceptive use and tubal ligation were associated with a lower lifetime risk 
of ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptive use and tubal ligation were essentially 
absent among the women at 4% to 9% lifetime risk.
IMPACT: This work demonstrates that there are women in the general population 
who have a much higher than average lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Preventive 
strategies are available. Should effective screening become available, higher 
than average risk women can be identified.

PURPOSE: Accurate estimation of life expectancy is critical for men considering 
aggressive vs nonaggressive treatment of early stage prostate cancer. We created 
an age adjusted comorbidity index that predicts other cause mortality in men 
with prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sampled 1,598 men consecutively diagnosed with 
prostate cancer between 1998 and 2004 at West Los Angeles and Long Beach 
Veterans Affairs hospitals. We used competing risks regression in testing and 
validation cohorts to determine the risk of nonprostate cancer related (ie other 
cause) mortality associated with age at diagnosis and PCCI score. We converted 
risk into a 10-point scoring system and calculated 2, 5 and 10-year cumulative 
incidence of other cause mortality by age adjusted PCCI scores.
RESULTS: PCCI score and age were associated with similar hazards of other cause 
mortality in the testing and validation cohorts. Each 6-year increase in age at 
diagnosis of greater than 60 was equivalent to 1 additional PCCI point. After 
correcting PCCI score for age the age adjusted PCCI scores were strongly 
predictive of other cause mortality. The subhazard ratio of other cause 
mortality vs 0 for a score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9 and 10+ was 2.0 (95% CI 
1.3-3.0), 4.0 (95% CI 2.6-6.1), 8.7 (95% CI 5.7-13.3), 14.7 (95% CI 9.4-22.8) 
and 43.2 (95% CI 26.6-70.4), respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence of 
other cause mortality was 10%, 19%, 35%, 60%, 79% and 99%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The age adjusted PCCI strongly stratifies the risk of long-term, 
other cause mortality. It may be incorporated into shared decision making to 
decrease overtreatment of older and chronically ill men with prostate cancer.

liver metastases.

Birmingham, Leeds, UK.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) is the 
standard of care when possible, although this strategy has not been compared 
with non-operative interventions in controlled trials. Although survival 
outcomes are clear, the cost-effectiveness of surgery is not. This study aimed 
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of resection for CRLMs compared with 
non-operative treatment (palliative care including chemotherapy).
METHODS: Operative and non-operative cohorts were identified from a 
prospectively maintained database. Patients in the operative cohort had a 
minimum of 10 years of follow-up. A model-based cost-utility analysis was 
conducted to quantify the mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 
a lifetime time horizon. The analysis was conducted from a healthcare provider 
perspective (UK National Health Service) in a secondary care (hospital) setting.
RESULTS: Median survival was 41 and 21 months in the operative and non-operative 
cohorts respectively (P < 0·001). The operative strategy dominated non-operative 
treatments, being less costly (€22,200 versus €32,800) and more effective (4·017 
versus 1·111 QALYs gained). The results of extensive sensitivity analysis showed 
that the operative strategy dominated non-operative treatment in every scenario.
CONCLUSION: Operative treatment of CRLMs yields greater survival than 
non-operative treatment, and is both more effective and less costly.

BACKGROUND: The appropriate thresholds for decisions on the cost-effectiveness 
of medical interventions remain controversial, especially in 'end-of-life' 
situations. Evidence of the values placed on different types of health gain by 
the general public is limited.
METHODS: Across nine European countries, 17,657 people were presented with 
different hypothetical health scenarios each involving a gain of one quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) and asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for 
that gain. The questions included quality of life (QoL) enhancing and life 
extending health gains, and a scenario where respondents faced imminent, 
premature death.
RESULTS: The mean WTP values for a one-QALY gain composed of QoL improvements 
were modest (PPP$11,000). When comparing QALY gains obtained in the near future, 
the valuation of life extension exceeded the valuation of QoL enhancing gains 
(mean WTP PPP$19,000 for a scenario in which a coma is avoided). The mean WTP 
values were higher still when respondents faced imminent, premature death 
(PPP$29,000).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the largest survey on the value of health gains by 
the general public indicated a higher value for life extending gains compared 
with QoL enhancing gains. A further modest premium may be indicated for life 
extension when facing imminent, premature death.

Crystal structures of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have recently revealed 
the molecular basis of ligand binding and activation, which has provided 
exciting opportunities for structure-based drug design. The A2A adenosine 
receptor (A2AAR) is a promising therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases, 
but progress in this area is limited by the lack of novel agonist scaffolds. We 
carried out docking screens of 6.7 million commercially available molecules 
against active-like conformations of the A2AAR to investigate whether these 
structures could guide the discovery of agonists. Nine out of the 20 predicted 
agonists were confirmed to be A2AAR ligands, but none of these activated the 
ARs. The difficulties in discovering AR agonists using structure-based methods 
originated from limited atomic-level understanding of the activation mechanism 
and a chemical bias toward antagonists in the screened library. In particular, 
the composition of the screened library was found to strongly reduce the 
likelihood of identifying AR agonists, which reflected the high ligand 
complexity required for receptor activation. Extension of this analysis to other 
pharmaceutically relevant GPCRs suggested that library screening may not be 
suitable for targets requiring a complex receptor-ligand interaction network. 
Our results provide specific directions for the future development of novel 
A2AAR agonists and general strategies for structure-based drug discovery.

Prosper and Live Long: Productive Life Span Tracks Increasing Overall Life Span 
Over Historical Time among Privileged Worker Groups.

Life expectancy has increased continuously for at least 150 years, due at least 
in part to improving life conditions for the majority of the population. A 
substantial part of this historical increase is due to decreases in early life 
mortality. In this article, we analyze the longevity of four privileged sets of 
adults who have avoided childhood mortality and lived a life more similar to the 
modern middle class. Our analysis is focused on writers and musicians from the 
17th through the 21st centuries. We show that their average age at death 
increased only slightly between 1600 and 1900, but in the 20th century increased 
at around 2 years/decade. We suggest that this confirms that modern life span 
extension is driven by delay of death in older life rather than avoidance of 
premature death. We also show that productive life span, as measured by writing 
and composition outputs, has increased in parallel with overall life span in 
these groups. Increase in age of death is confirmed in a group of the minor 
British aristocracy and in members of the US Congress from 1800 to 2010. We 
conclude that both life span and productive life span are increasing in the 20th 
and early 21st century, and that the modern prolongation of life is the 
extension of productive life and is not the addition of years of disabling 
illness to the end of life.
