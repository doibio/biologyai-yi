Cervical burn scar contracture (BSC) affects many important neck functions and 
the patients' quality of life. However, it remains unclear which patients have a 
higher risk of neck BSCs. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and 
identify the independent risks of cervical BSC formation and severity. Clinical 
and demographic data of 106 patients with burn scars were retrospectively 
collated and analyzed from 3 different Chinese hospitals between December 2016 
and December 2020. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to identify the independent risks for BSC formation and severity 
at 12 months postburn. Lateral flexion was the most common plane of motion (POM) 
limited by contractures (29.4%), whereas the POM most commonly limited by severe 
contractures was the extension (24.6%). Most patients with contractures had 
those in 3 to 4 POMs (72.1%). Neck skin grafting was an independent risk factor 
for BSC formation, and cervical and cervicothoracic skin grafting were 
independent risk factors for BSC severity. These results may help to identify 
high-risk patients with contractures in the early stages of burns to carry out 
individualized early prevention and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to apply COnsensus-based 
standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) 
methodology to review psychometric properties of patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROMs) of HIV-related stigma and/or discrimination.
INTRODUCTION: Due to the development of antiretroviral therapy, the life 
expectancy of people living with HIV is similar to the life expectancy of the 
rest of the population. However, HIV-related stigma and discrimination are still 
major barriers to improving the quality of life of persons living with HIV. 
These barriers are a threat to these individuals and the world's public health 
care systems. Accurate and reproducible PROMs are prerequisites for robust and 
reliable results. Therefore, it is important to choose acceptable PROMs with 
satisfactory psychometric properties to assess HIV-related stigma and/or 
discrimination. However, there has been no systematic review of HIV-related 
stigma or discrimination PROMs in the field of HIV care.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: All studies including adults (age ≥18 years) living with HIV 
will be eligible for inclusion in this review. The review will consider studies 
that report 1 or more psychometric properties of HIV-related stigma and/or 
discrimination PROMs. We will consider studies conducted in any country or 
setting published in English or Chinese.
METHODS: Nine databases will be searched from January 1, 1996, to the present, 
including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ProQuest 
Dissertations and Theses, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure, and Wanfang. Assessment of methodological quality, data 
extraction, data synthesis, and assessing certainty in the findings will be 
conducted using the COSMIN methodology.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the association between SJLsc 
(sleep-corrected social jetlag) and depressive mood is significant and 
independent of sleep debt.
METHODS: Participants from the general adult population were interviewed using 
structured questionnaires on sleep duration, weekday/weekend sleep schedules, 
and depressive mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Social jetlag (SJL) was 
measured by SJLsc and standard SJL (SJLs). SJLs was the absolute difference 
between mid-sleep time on free days (MSF) and workdays (MSW). For SJLsc, both 
MSF and MSW were adjusted for average sleep duration across the week according 
to the direction of sleep debt. Sleep debt was defined by sleep extension on 
free days. The association of SJL with depression was investigated, and 
covariates included age, sex, sociodemographic factors, insomnia symptoms, sleep 
duration, and sleep debt.
RESULTS: A total of 1982 individuals (1089 men; age 43.1 ± 14.4 years) were 
analyzed. SJL was present in 24.6% measured by SJLsc and 51.0% by SJLs. SJLsc 
and SJLs were significantly associated with depressive mood (r = 0.06, P = 0.02; 
r = 0.06, P = 0.01, respectively), independent of sleep debt. Sleep debt was 
also associated with depression (r = 0.07, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: By adopting sleep-corrected formula for SJL, this study found that 
misaligned and insufficient sleep, at levels occurring in routine social life, 
can negatively affect mood. Minimizing social jetlag and sleep deprivation may 
promote individual psychological well-being.

INTRODUCTION: With the global increase in life expectancy, there is an increase 
in gastrointestinal presentations in the elderly. Small bowel bleeding (SBB) is 
a cause of significant morbidity in the elderly requiring multiple hospital 
visits, investigations, and potentially expensive therapy.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we will outline the different modalities which 
are used for the diagnosis and management of SBB. We will also discuss the 
common causes of SBB in the elderly.
EXPERT OPINION: SBB in elderly has a significant impact on the quality of life 
of the elderly. Larger randomized studies in the elderly are urgently required 
to help guide clinicians on the best and most cost-effective treatment algorithm 
in this challenging cohort.

Different Types of Patient Health Information Associated With Physician 
Decision-making Regarding Cancer Screening Cessation for Older Adults.

Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.

IMPORTANCE: Although guidelines use limited life expectancy to guide physician 
decision-making regarding cessation of cancer screening, many physicians 
recommend screening for older adults with limited life expectancies. Different 
ways of presenting information may influence older adults' screening 
decision-making; whether the same is true for physicians is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine how different ways of presenting patient health 
information are associated with physician decision-making about cancer screening 
cessation for older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A national survey was mailed from April 29 to 
November 8, 2021, to a random sample of 1800 primary care physicians and 600 
gynecologists from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. 
Primary care physicians were surveyed about breast, colorectal, or prostate 
cancer screenings. Gynecologists were surveyed about breast cancer screening.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using vignettes of 2 older patients with limited 
life expectancies, 4 pieces of information about each patient were presented: 
(1) description of health conditions and functional status, (2) life expectancy, 
(3) equivalent physiological age, and (4) risk of dying from the specific cancer 
in the patient's remaining lifetime. The primary outcome was which information 
was perceived to be the most influential in screening cessation.
RESULTS: The final sample included 776 participants (adjusted response rate, 
52.8%; mean age, 51.4 years [range, 27-91 years]; 402 of 775 participants were 
men [51.9%]; 508 of 746 participants were White [68.1%]). The 2 types of 
information that were most often chosen as the factors most influential in 
cancer screening cessation were description of the patient's health or 
functional status (36.7% of vignettes [569 of 1552]) and risk of death from 
cancer in the patient's remaining lifetime (34.9% of vignettes [542 of 1552]). 
Life expectancy was chosen as the most influential factor in 23.1% of vignettes 
(358 of 1552). Physiological age was the least often chosen (5.3% of vignettes 
[83 of 1552]) as the most influential factor. Description of patient's health or 
functional status was the most influential factor among primary care physicians 
(estimated probability, 40.2%; 95% CI, 36.2%-44.2%), whereas risk of death from 
cancer was the most influential factor among gynecologists (estimated 
probability, 43.1%; 95% CI, 34.0%-52.1%). Life expectancy was perceived as a 
more influential factor in the vignette with more limited life expectancy 
(estimated probability, 27.9%; 95% CI, 24.5%-31.3%) and for colorectal cancer 
(estimated probability, 33.9%; 95% CI, 27.3%-40.5%) or prostate cancer (28.0%; 
95% CI, 21.7%-34.2%) screening than for breast cancer screening (estimated 
probability, 14.5%; 95% CI, 10.9%-18.0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this national survey study of 
physicians suggest that, in addition to the patient's health and functional 
status, the cancer risk in the patient's remaining lifetime and life expectancy 
were the factors most associated with physician decision-making regarding cancer 
screening cessation; information on cancer risk in the patient's remaining 
lifetime and life expectancy is not readily available during clinical 
encounters. Decision support tools that present a patient's cancer risk and/or 
limited life expectancy may help reduce overscreening among older adults.

What happens when you stop? This is the third of a three-part series on 
antihypertensive medication use in older people. In the first, we reviewed the 
importance of better blood pressure (BP) control, even in older people with 
hypertension. In the second, we discussed the limitations of the evidence 
favoring intensive therapy for some older people. For older people with advanced 
frailty or those with a limited life expectancy, medications taken for BP can 
actually be a source of morbidity. Guidelines encourage clinical judgment and 
rational prescribing. Sometimes the best action is to stop prescribing. 
De-prescribing of medical therapy is now considered good practice for a range of 
medications for suitable patients; should this include antihypertensives? In 
part three of this three-part series, we will review some of the evidence 
available thus far, demonstrating de-intensification of antihypertensive 
medications is not a new idea. We will offer a guide to identifying the most 
suitable patients for de-prescribing: cognitive impairment, frailty, when 
circumstances change, or when BP is (too) well-controlled. This is an area of 
equipoise and needs more research. There is a path forward that we hope to 
illuminate.

(1) Background: Some of the goals of orthopedic surgical oncology are saving 
limbs and function. The humerus is the third most frequent site in primary 
tumors and one of the most involved sites for metastases. Prosthetic replacement 
with modular megaprosthesis is one of the treatment choices, but there are 
several types of complications, such as problems with function and pain. The aim 
of our study is to assess functional outcomes and shoulder instability in the 
reconstruction of proximal humerus metastases. (2) Methods: This is a 
retrospective observational study. Twenty-eight patients, with proximal humerus 
metastases, admitted to the department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology of our 
University Hospital between 2014 and 2022 were recruited. Each patient underwent 
resection and prosthetic replacement surgery with modular megaprosthesis. 
Clinical evaluation was assessed through MSTS score, WOSI index, and DASH score. 
(3) Results: Twenty patients were included in the study. Fairly good results, 
especially regarding pain, function, and emotional acceptance, were obtained in 
all three tests: DASH, MSTS, and WOSI. Patients who reported shoulder 
instability actually have worse outcomes than those who report having stable 
shoulders. In addition, patients with a resection >10 cm have worse outcomes 
than those who had a resection of 10 cm. No significant differences were found 
between the deltopectoral approach group and the lateral approach group. (4) 
Conclusions: Reconstructive surgery with megaprosthesis of the proximal humerus 
in patients with metastases can be considered a treatment option, especially in 
patients with pathological fractures or injuries with a high risk of fracture 
and good life expectancy. This study shows how this type of surgery affects 
instability, but in terms of functionality, pain, and patient satisfaction, it 
gives satisfactory results.

INTRODUCTION: The ongoing ageing population is associated with an increase in 
the number of patients suffering a stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or 
myocardial infarction (MI). In these patients, implementing secondary prevention 
is a critical challenge and new strategies need to be developed to close the gap 
between clinical practice and evidence-based recommendations. We describe the 
protocol of a randomised clinical trial that aims to evaluate the efficiency and 
effectiveness of an intensive multidisciplinary follow-up of patients compared 
with standard care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DiVa study is a randomised, prospective, controlled, 
multicentre trial including patients >18 years old with a first or recurrent 
stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or TIA, or a type I or II MI, managed in one 
of the participating hospitals of the study area, with a survival expectancy >12 
months. Patients will be randomised with an allocation ratio of 1:1 in two 
parallel groups: one group assigned to a multidisciplinary, nurse-based and 
pharmacist-based 2-year follow-up in association with general practitioners, 
neurologists and cardiologists versus one group with usual follow-up. In each 
group for each disease (stroke/TIA or MI), 430 patients will be enrolled (total 
of 1720 patients) over 3 years. The primary outcome will be the incremental 
cost-utility ratio at 24 months between intensive and standard follow-up in a 
society perspective. Secondary outcomes will include the incremental 
cost-utility ratio at 6 and 12 months, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
at 24 months, reduction at 6, 12 and 24 months of the rates of death, 
unscheduled rehospitalisation and iatrogenic complications, changes in quality 
of life, net budgetary impact at 5 years of the intensive follow-up on the 
national health insurance perspective and analysis of factors having positive or 
negative effects on the implementation of the project in the study area.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained and all patients receive 
information about the study and give their consent to participate before 
randomisation. Results of the main trial and each of the secondary analyses will 
be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

    MMW Fortschr Med. 2023 Oct;165(18):37.

This article contributes to the discussion on the determinants of diverging life 
expectancy in high-income countries, with a focus on Germany. To date, much of 
this discourse has centered around the social determinants of health, issues of 
healthcare equity, poverty and income inequality, and new epidemics of opioids 
and violence. Yet despite doing well on all of these metrics and having numerous 
advantages such as comparatively strong economic performance, generous social 
security, and an equitable and well-resourced health care system, Germany has 
been a long-time life expectancy laggard among the high-income countries. Using 
aggregated population-level mortality data for Germany and selected six 
high-income countries (Switzerland, France, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States) from the Human Mortality Database and WHO Mortality 
Database, we find that the German longevity shortfall is mainly explained by a 
longstanding disadvantage in survival among older adults and adults nearing 
statutory retirement age, which mainly stems from sustained excess 
cardiovascular disease mortality, even when compared to other laggard countries 
such as the US and the UK. Patchy contextual data suggests that the unfavorable 
pattern of cardiovascular mortality may be driven by underperforming primary 
care and disease prevention. More systematic and representative data on risk 
factors are needed to strengthen the evidence base on the determinants of the 
controversial and long-standing health gap between more successful countries and 
Germany. The German example calls for broader narratives of population health 
that embed the variety of epidemiological challenges populations face around the 
globe.

PURPOSE: Evolving investigative techniques are providing greater understanding 
about the early neuromuscular responses to resistance training among novice 
exercisers. The aim of this study was to investigate the time-course of changes 
in muscle contractile mechanics, architecture, neuromuscular, and strength 
adaptation during the first 6-weeks of lower-limb resistance training.
METHODS: Forty participants: 22 intervention (10 males/12 females; 
173.48 ± 5.20 cm; 74.01 ± 13.13 kg) completed 6-week resistance training, and 18 
control (10 males/8 females; 175.52 ± 7.64 cm; 70.92 ± 12.73 kg) performed no 
resistance training and maintained their habitual activity. Radial muscle 
displacement (Dm) assessed via tensiomyography, knee extension maximal voluntary 
contraction (MVC), voluntary activation (VA), corticospinal excitability and 
inhibition via transcranial magnetic stimulation, motor unit (MU) firing rate, 
and muscle thickness and pennation angle via ultrasonography were assessed 
before and after 2, 4, and 6-weeks of dynamic lower-limb resistance training or 
control.
RESULTS: After 2-weeks training, Dm reduced by 19-25% in the intervention group; 
this was before any changes in neural or morphological measures. After 4-weeks 
training, MVC increased by 15% along with corticospinal excitability by 16%; 
however, there was no change in VA, corticospinal inhibition, or MU firing rate. 
After 6-weeks training there was further MVC increase by 6% along with muscle 
thickness by 13-16% and pennation angle by 13-14%.
CONCLUSION: Enhanced contractile properties and corticospinal excitability 
occurred before any muscle architecture, neural, and strength adaptation. Later 
increases in muscular strength can be accounted for by architectural adaptation.

OBJECTIVE: To simulate economic outcomes for individuals with diabetic macular 
edema (DME) and estimate the economic value of direct and indirect benefits 
associated with DME treatment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Our study pairs individual and cohort analyses to 
demonstrate the value of treatment for DME. We used a microsimulation model to 
simulate self-reported vision (SRV) and economic outcomes for individuals with 
DME. Four scenarios derived from clinical trial data were simulated and compared 
for a lifetime horizon: untreated, anti-VEGF therapy, laser, and steroid. To 
quantify the relative magnitude of costs and benefits of DME treatment in the 
U.S., we used a cohort-level analysis based on real-world treatment parameters 
derived from published data.
RESULTS: In the model, excellent/good SRV roughly corresponded to 20/40 or 
better visual acuity. A representative 51-year-old treated for DME would spend 
30-35% additional years with excellent/good SRV and 29-32% fewer years with 
fair/poor SRV relative to being untreated. A treated individual would experience 
4-5% greater life expectancy and 9-13% more quality-adjusted life-years. 
Indirect benefits from treatment included 6-9% more years working, 12-19% 
greater lifetime earnings, and 8-16% fewer years with disability. For the U.S. 
DME cohort (1.1. million people), total direct benefit was $63.0 billion over 20 
years, and total indirect benefit was $4.8 billion. Net value (benefit - cost) 
of treatment ranged from $28.1 billion to $52.8 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for DME provides economic value to patients and society 
through improved vision, life expectancy, and quality of life and indirectly 
through improved employment and disability outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Today, medical technology and healthcare advances have led to an 
increased life expectancy; however, the prevalence of chronic diseases such as 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and cardiovascular events is 
continuously rising. In particular, hypertension is a crucial factor in 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and it is known that prevention and 
management are essential.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the prevalence and management of 
hypertension in Korean adults and evaluates its correlation with the risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.
METHOD: The Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (KNHANES) 
database was utilized for this study (https://knhanes.cdc.go.kr). The subjects 
of this survey were sampled to represent the entire population of Korea. The 
study aims to assess the risk of CVD and stroke according to the duration of 
hypertension. We also examined the impact of hypertension control on the risk of 
CVD and stroke. This study is a retrospective cross-sectional study, so future 
risks cannot be assessed, but only the disease status at the same time point.
RESULTS: A total of 61,379 subjects were enrolled in the KNHANES database, 
representing Korea's population of 49,068,178 subjects. The prevalence of 
hypertension was 25.7% (9,965,618 subjects) of the total population. The 
prevalence of hypertension increased rapidly with the age of the population. As 
the duration of hypertension increased, the risks of CVD and stroke also 
increased. When hypertension lasts longer than 20 years, ischemic heart disease, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke prevalence were 14.6%, 5.0%, and 12.2%, 
respectively. However, achieving a target blood pressure (BP) goal below 140/90 
mmHg reduced the risk of all CVD and stroke by nearly half. Nevertheless, fewer 
than two-thirds of patients in Korea with hypertension achieved this targeted 
blood pressure goal.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that the prevalence of hypertension in Korean 
adults was higher than a quarter but also showed that the risk of CVD and stroke 
was significantly reduced by achieving optimal blood pressure control. Based on 
these results, policy efforts are needed to reach the target BP and improve the 
treatment rates for hypertension in Korea.

BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the leading cause of mortality in 
systemic sclerosis (SSc).
OBJECTIVE: We performed an overview of the diagnostic approaches, follow-up and 
treatment strategies used in France for the management of SSc-associated ILD 
(SSc-ILD).
DESIGN STRUCTURED NATIONWIDE ONLINE SURVEYMETHODS: A structured nationwide 
online survey was submitted to participants via the French Medical Societies for 
Internal Medicine and Pneumology, and research groups on SSc-ILD from May 2018 
to June 2020. The 79 multiple-choice and 9 open-ended questions covered the 
screening of ILD at baseline, monitoring of patients with established SSc-ILD 
and its management. Fourteen optional vignettes exploring different clinical 
phenotypes of SSc-ILD were submitted to evaluate therapeutic decisions.
RESULTS: All of the 93 participants screened SSc patients for ILD at baseline 
with 83 (89%) participants relying on a systematic chest computed tomography 
(CT) scan. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were prescribed by 87 (94%) 
participants at baseline and during follow-up. Treatment was started based on 
abnormal PFT (95%), chest CT scan characteristics (89%), worsening dyspnoea 
(72%) and drop in SpO2 during 6-min walk tests (66%). First-line therapy was 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) (89%), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (83%) and prednisone 
(73%). Rituximab as second-line immunosuppressive therapy (41%) was preferred to 
antifibrotic agents (18%), and a median daily prednisone dose of 10 mg 
(interquartile range, 10-15) was prescribed by 73% participants. Extensive 
SSc-ILD with worsening PFT (95%), regardless of diffusing capacity for carbon 
monoxide values and skin extension, were more likely to be treated, and CYC was 
favoured over MMF (p < 0.01). Extensive SSc-ILD with disease duration of less 
than 5 years was also a criterium for treatment initiation.
CONCLUSION: This overview of practices in diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of 
SSc-ILD in France describes real-life management of patients. It highlights 
heterogeneity in this management and gaps in current strategies that should be 
addressed to improve and harmonize clinical practices in SSc-ILD.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
percutaneous ablation versus hepatectomy in an elderly population with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Retrospective data on patients aged ≥ 65 years with very-early/early 
stages of HCC (≤ 50 mm) were obtained from three centers in China. Inverse 
probability of treatment weighting analysis was performed after stratifying the 
patients by age (65 - 69, 70 - 74 and ≥ 75 years).
RESULTS: Of the 1,145 patients, 561 and 584 underwent resection and ablation, 
respectively. For patients aged 65 - 69 and 70 - 74 years, resection resulted in 
significantly better overall survival (OS) than ablation (age 65 - 69, P < 
0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.27; age 70 - 74, P = 0.012, HR = 0.64). However, in 
patients aged ≥ 75 years, resection and ablation resulted in a similar OS (P = 
0.44, HR = 0.84). An interactive effect existed between treatment and age 
(effect of treatment on OS, age 65 - 69 as the reference, for age 70 - 74, P = 
0.039; for age ≥ 75, P = 0.002). The HCC-related death rate was higher in 
patients aged 65 - 69, and the liver/other cause-related death rate was higher 
in patients aged > 69. Multivariate analyses showed that the type of treatment, 
number of tumors, α-fetoprotein level, serum albumin level and associated 
diabetes mellitus were independent factors associated with OS, but not 
hypertension or heart diseases.
CONCLUSION: With increasing patient age, the treatment outcomes of ablation 
become similar to those of resection. A higher liver/other cause-related death 
rate in very elderly patients may shorten the life expectancy, which may lead to 
the same OS regardless of whether resection or ablation is chosen.

BACKGROUND: Fragility fracture is associated with an increased risk of 
mortality, but mortality is not part of doctor-patient communication. Here, we 
introduce a new concept called 'Skeletal Age' as the age of an individual's 
skeleton resulting from a fragility fracture to convey the combined risk of 
fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual.
METHODS: We used the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register which includes 
the whole-country data of 1,667,339 adults in Denmark born on or before January 
1, 1950, who were followed up to December 31, 2016 for incident low-trauma 
fracture and mortality. Skeletal age is defined as the sum of chronological age 
and the number of years of life lost (YLL) associated with a fracture. Cox's 
proportional hazards model was employed to determine the hazard of mortality 
associated with a specific fracture for a given risk profile, and the hazard was 
then transformed into YLL using the Gompertz law of mortality.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 16 years, there had been 307,870 
fractures and 122,744 post-fracture deaths. A fracture was associated with 
between 1 and 7 years of life lost, with the loss being greater in men than 
women. Hip fractures incurred the greatest loss of life years. For instance, a 
60-year-old individual with a hip fracture is estimated to have a skeletal age 
of 66 for men and 65 for women. Skeletal Age was estimated for each age and 
fracture site stratified by gender.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose 'Skeletal Age' as a new metric to assess the impact of a 
fragility fracture on an individual's life expectancy. This approach will 
enhance doctor-patient risk communication about the risks associated with 
osteoporosis.

Plain Language Summary: Osteoporosis is a ‘silent disease’ which often has no 
immediate symptoms but gradually weakens bones and makes them more likely to 
break. A bone fracture caused by osteoporosis in people over the age of 50 is 
linked to long-term health decline and in some cases, even early death. However, 
poor communication of the mortality risk to patients has led to a low uptake of 
treatment, resulting in a crisis of osteoporosis management. The impact of a 
fracture on life expectancy is typically conveyed to patients and the public in 
terms of probability (how likely something is to occur) or the relative risk of 
death compared to other groups. However, statements such as “Your risk of death 
over the next 10 years is 5% if you have suffered from a bone fracture” can be 
difficult to comprehend and can lead to patients underestimating the gravity of 
the risk. With the aim of devising a new way of conveying risks to patients, 
Tran et al. analyzed the relationship between fracture and lifespan in over 1.6 
million individuals who were 50 years of age or older. The findings showed that 
one fracture was associated with losing up to 7 years of life, depending on 
gender, age and fracture site. Based on this finding, Tran et al. proposed the 
idea of 'skeletal age' as a new metric for quantifying the impact of a fracture 
on life expectancy. Skeletal age is the sum of the chronological age of a 
patient and the estimated number of years of life lost following a fracture. For 
example, a 60-year-old man with a hip fracture is predicted to lose an estimated 
6 years of life, resulting in a skeletal age of around 66. Therefore, this 
individual has the same life expectancy as a 66-year-old person that has not 
experienced a fracture. Skeletal age can also be used to quantify the benefit of 
osteoporosis treatments. Some approved treatments substantially reduce the 
likelihood of post-fracture death and translating this into skeletal age could 
help communicate this to patients. For instance, telling patients that “This 
treatment will reduce your skeletal age by 2 years” is easier to understand than 
“This treatment will reduce your risk of death by 25%”. Given the current crisis 
of osteoporosis management, adopting skeletal age as a new measure of how the 
skeleton declines after a fracture could enhance doctor-patient communication 
regarding treatment options and fracture risk assessment. Tran et al. are now 
developing an online tool called ‘BONEcheck.org’ to enable health care 
professionals and the public to calculate skeletal age. Future work should 
investigate the effectiveness of this new metric in conveying risk to patients, 
compared with current methods.

Practicing complex everyday life walking activities is challenging in paediatric 
neurorehabilitation, although it would prepare patients more comprehensively for 
the requirements of daily life. Floor projections allow simulation and training 
of such situations in therapy. Twenty healthy youths aged 6-18 years stepped 
over a tree trunk and balanced over kerbstones in a real and projected 
condition. Spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters of the two conditions were 
compared by equivalence analysis, using the medians of the differences between 
the two conditions with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Velocity, 
step and stride length, step width, and single support time were generally 
equivalent between the two conditions. Knee and hip joint angles and toe 
clearance decreased substantially during the execution phase of the projected 
tree trunk condition. The largest differences were found at the end of the 
execution phase in both tasks for the ankle joints. As spatiotemporal parameters 
were equivalent between the conditions, floor projections seem suitable to train 
precise foot placement. However, differences in knee and hip joint kinematics 
and toe clearance revealed that floor projections are not applicable for 
obstacles with a vertical extension. Therefore, exercises aiming at knee and hip 
flexion improvement should favourably be trained with real objects.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have explored the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy 
versus chemotherapy alone. However, there is paucity of evidence on direct 
pharmacoeconomic studies related to immunotherapy combinations. Thus, we aimed 
at assessing the economic outcomes of first-line immunotherapy combinations in 
the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the Chinese 
health care perspective.
METHODS: The mutual hazard ratios (HRs) of ten immunotherapy combinations and 
one chemotherapy regimen for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS) were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Based on proportional 
hazard (PH) assumption, adjusted OS and PFS curves were established to make the 
effects comparable. With the parameters of cost and utility, and of scale and 
shape from the fit of adjusted OS and PFS curves obtained from previous studies, 
a partitioned survival model was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
immunotherapy combinations versus chemotherapy alone. Parameter uncertainty in 
model inputs was assessed using one-way deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The incremental cost of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy alone was $13,180.65, the lowest among all the other immunotherapy 
combinations. Furthermore, sintilimab plus chemotherapy (sint-chemo) provided 
the highest quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) benefit versus chemotherapy alone 
(incremental QALYs = 0.45). Sint-chemo yielded the best incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) versus chemotherapy alone 
(ICER = $34,912.09/QALY), at the current price. The cost-effectiveness 
probabilities were 32.01% and 93.91% for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, respectively (if the original 
price of the pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab were decreased by 
90%).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the fact that there is fierce competition in the 
PD-1/PD-L1 market, pharmaceutical enterprises should strive for greater 
efficacy, and optimal pricing strategy for therapies.
