OBJECTIVES: We used the results of the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to 
estimate trends of HIV/AIDS burden in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) 
countries between 1990 and 2015.
METHODS: Tailored estimation methods were used to produce final estimates of 
mortality. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying the 
mortality rate by population by age-specific life expectancy. Years lived with 
disability (YLDs) were computed as the prevalence of a sequela multiplied by its 
disability weight.
RESULTS: In 2015, the rate of HIV/AIDS deaths in the EMR was 1.8 (1.4-2.5) per 
100,000 population, a 43% increase from 1990 (0.3; 0.2-0.8). Consequently, the 
rate of YLLs due to HIV/AIDS increased from 15.3 (7.6-36.2) per 100,000 in 1990 
to 81.9 (65.3-114.4) in 2015. The rate of YLDs increased from 1.3 (0.6-3.1) in 
1990 to 4.4 (2.7-6.6) in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality increased in the EMR since 1990. 
To reverse this trend and achieve epidemic control, EMR countries should 
strengthen HIV surveillance, and scale up HIV antiretroviral therapy and 
comprehensive prevention services.

OBJECTIVES: We used GBD 2015 findings to measure the burden of intentional 
injuries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) between 1990 and 2015.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study defines intentional injuries 
as a combination of self-harm (including suicide), interpersonal violence, 
collective violence (war), and legal intervention. We estimated number of 
deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for each type of intentional injuries.
RESULTS: In 2015, 28,695 individuals (95% UI: 25,474-37,832) died from 
self-harm, 35,626 (95% UI: 20,947-41,857) from interpersonal violence, and 
143,858 (95% UI: 63,554-223,092) from collective violence and legal 
interventions. In 2015, collective violence and legal intervention was the 
fifth-leading cause of DALYs in the EMR and the leading cause in Syria, Yemen, 
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya; they account for 49.7% of total DALYs in Syria.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for increased efforts to stabilize the region and 
assist in rebuilding the health systems, as well as increasing transparency and 
employing preventive strategies to reduce self-harm and interpersonal injuries.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) caused by cancer in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) between 2005 
and 2015.
METHODS: Vital registration system and cancer registry data from the EMR region 
were analyzed for 29 cancer groups in 22 EMR countries using the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2015 methodology.
RESULTS: In 2015, cancer was responsible for 9.4% of all deaths and 5.1% of all 
DALYs. It accounted for 722,646 new cases, 379,093 deaths, and 11.7 million 
DALYs. Between 2005 and 2015, incident cases increased by 46%, deaths by 33%, 
and DALYs by 31%. The increase in cancer incidence was largely driven by 
population growth and population aging. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia 
were the most common cancers, while lung, breast, and stomach cancers caused 
most cancer deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer is responsible for a substantial disease burden in the EMR, 
which is increasing. There is an urgent need to expand cancer prevention, 
screening, and awareness programs in EMR countries as well as to improve 
diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care services.

OBJECTIVES: Transport injuries (TI) are ranked as one of the leading causes of 
death, disability, and property loss worldwide. This paper provides an overview 
of the burden of TI in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) by age and sex 
from 1990 to 2015.
METHODS: Transport injuries mortality in the EMR was estimated using the Global 
Burden of Disease mortality database, with corrections for ill-defined causes of 
death, using the cause of death ensemble modeling tool. Morbidity estimation was 
based on inpatient and outpatient datasets, 26 cause-of-injury and 47 
nature-of-injury categories.
RESULTS: In 2015, 152,855 (95% uncertainty interval: 137,900-168,100) people 
died from TI in the EMR countries. Between 1990 and 2015, the years of life lost 
(YLL) rate per 100,000 due to TI decreased by 15.5%, while the years lived with 
disability (YLD) rate decreased by 10%, and the age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate decreased by 16%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the burden of TI mortality and morbidity decreased over 
the last two decades, there is still a considerable burden that needs to be 
addressed by increasing awareness, enforcing laws, and improving road 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: The English community pharmacy New Medicine Service (NMS) 
significantly increases patient adherence to medicines, compared with normal 
practice. We examined the cost effectiveness of NMS compared with normal 
practice by combining adherence improvement and intervention costs with the 
effect of increased adherence on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
METHODS: We developed Markov models for diseases targeted by the NMS 
(hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
asthma and antiplatelet regimens) to assess the impact of patients' 
non-adherence. Clinical event probability, treatment pathway, resource use and 
costs were extracted from literature and costing tariffs. Incremental costs and 
outcomes associated with each disease were incorporated additively into a 
composite probabilistic model and combined with adherence rates and intervention 
costs from the trial. Costs per extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were 
calculated from the perspective of NHS England, using a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: NMS generated a mean of 0.05 (95% CI 0.00-0.13) more QALYs per patient, 
at a mean reduced cost of -£144 (95% CI -769 to 73). The NMS dominates normal 
practice with a probability of 0.78 [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
-£3166 per QALY]. NMS has a 96.7% probability of cost effectiveness compared 
with normal practice at a willingness to pay of £20,000 per QALY. Sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that targeting each disease with NMS has a probability 
over 0.90 of cost effectiveness compared with normal practice at a willingness 
to pay of £20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the NMS increased patient medicine 
adherence compared with normal practice, which translated into increased health 
gain at reduced overall cost.

Cost-effectiveness of pediatric bilateral cochlear implantation in Spain.

Pérez-Martín J(1), Artaso MA(1), Díez FJ(1).

Distancia (UNED), Madrid, Spain.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
bilateral versus unilateral cochlear implantation for 1-year-old children 
suffering from bilateral sensorineural severe to profound hearing loss from the 
perspective of the Spanish public health system.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a general-population survey to estimate the 
quality-of-life increase contributed by the second implant. We built a Markov 
influence diagram and evaluated it for a life-long time horizon with a 3% 
discount rate in the base case.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of simultaneous bilateral 
implantation with respect to unilateral implantation for 1-year-old children 
with severe to profound deafness is €10,323 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). For sequential bilateral implantation, it rises to €11,733/QALY. Both 
options are cost-effective for the Spanish health system, whose willingness to 
pay is estimated at around €30,000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
shows that the probability of bilateral implantation being cost-effective 
reaches 100% for that cost-effectiveness threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral implantation is clearly cost-effective for the population 
considered. If possible, it should be done simultaneously (i.e., in one surgical 
operation), because it is as safe and effective as sequential implantation, and 
saves costs for the system and for users and their families. Sequential 
implantation is also cost-effective for children who have received the first 
implant recently, but it is difficult to determine when it ceases to be so 
because of the lack of detailed data. These results are specific for Spain, but 
the model can easily be adapted to other countries.

AIM: It has been demonstrated that long-term oxygen therapy increased exercise 
capacity, improved the quality of life, reduced hospitalization and increased 
life expectancy in chronic hypoxemic COPD patients. The present study aims to 
evaluate the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COPD patients 
receiving long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) compared to COPD patients not 
receiving LTOT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic hypoxemic COPD patients using LTOT (LTOT group) 
and COPD patients not receiving LTOT (non-LTOT group) who participated in this 
study underwent a comprehensive 8-week outpatient PR program.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven out of 61 severe/very severe cases with COPD received LTOT 
at home, and 34 did not. After PR, 6-minute walking distance (6mWD) increased 
significantly and perceived dyspnea decreased significantly in both groups 
(P < .001, both). This change was significantly higher in the LTOT-receiving 
group compared to the non-LTOT Group (P = .046, P = .012). In both groups, all 
items in the disease-related quality of life questionnaire (QoL) were improved, 
and the scores in the health-related QoL questionnaire exhibited an improvement 
(P < .05, for all). Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lowered in 
both groups (P < .05, both).
CONCLUSIONS: Those COPD patients receiving the LTOT benefited from the PR as 
much as those COPD patients not receiving LTOT. The former group had a higher 
increase in 6mWD and a higher reduction in dyspnea symptoms. Further studies are 
required to understand to what extent the severe chronic hypoxemic COPD patients 
could benefit from the PR.

OBJECTIVE: Due to the short life expectancy of black men, it is important to 
understand what impacts health behaviors in this group so that interventions and 
programs can be developed to improve their health behaviors which may help in 
increasing the life expectancy of black men. The purpose of this study was to 
understand what perceived barriers exist for black college men that prevent them 
from engaging in healthy behaviors.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five black male students at a southern 
Historically Black College and University participated in five focus groups and 
four interviews. A qualitative analysis was used to analyze data for similar 
themes and codes.
RESULTS: Perceived barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors appear to be 
influenced by image, food cost, and education. Cues to action for not engaging 
in healthy behaviors appear to be related to role models.
CONCLUSIONS: Black college men are not adequately informed or educated about 
elements that can impact their health and how they can improve it. College 
administrators and researchers should develop interventions that include 
elements of increasing health knowledge and age-appropriate role models to 
improve health behavior change among this group.

INTRODUCTION: Until now, estimates of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) have 
mainly been produced on national or regional levels. These general estimates, 
however, are less useful for city governments who have to take decisions on 
local scales. To address this gap, we focused on the city-level burden of 
disease (BD) due to exposures affected by urban and transport planning. We 
conducted a BD assessment using the Urban and Transport Planning Health Impact 
Assessment (UTOPHIA) tool to estimate annual preventable morbidity and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under compliance with international 
exposure recommendations for physical activity (PA), exposure to air pollution, 
noise, heat, and access to green spaces in Barcelona, Spain.
METHODS: Exposure estimates and morbidity data were available for 1,357,361 
Barcelona residents ≥20years (2012). We compared recommended with current 
exposure levels to estimate the associated BD. We quantified associations 
between exposures and morbidities and calculated population attributable 
fractions to estimate the number of attributable cases. We calculated DALYs 
using GBD Study 2015 background DALY estimates for Spain, which were scaled to 
Barcelona considering differences in population size, age and sex structures. We 
also estimated annual health costs that could be avoided under compliance with 
exposure recommendations.
RESULTS: Not complying with recommended levels for PA, air pollution, noise, 
heat and access to green spaces was estimated to generate a large morbidity 
burden and resulted in 52,001 DALYs (95% CI: 42,866-61,136) in Barcelona each 
year (13% of all annual DALYs). From this BD 36% (i.e. 18,951 DALYs) was due to 
traffic noise with sleep disturbance and annoyance contributing largely (i.e. 
10,548 DALYs). Non-compliance was estimated to result in direct health costs of 
20.10 million € (95% CI: 15.36-24.83) annually.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-compliance of international exposure recommendations was 
estimated to result in a considerable BD and in substantial economic expenditure 
each year in Barcelona. Our findings suggest that (1) the reduction of motor 
traffic together with the promotion of active transport and (2) the provision of 
green infrastructure would result in a considerable BD avoided and substantial 
savings to the public health care system, as these measures can provide 
mitigation of noise, air pollution and heat as well as opportunities for PA 
promotion.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: As the overall health and life expectancy increases in 
the United States, the incidence of fragility fractures in elderly patients also 
continues to increase. Given their medical comorbidities and decreased bone 
mineral density, acetabular fractures in the elderly population present a 
significant challenge to the orthopaedic trauma surgeon. The anterior column 
posterior hemitransverse (ACPHT) fracture pattern is a common fracture pattern 
in this population, and is often associated with central subluxation/dislocation 
of the femoral head with articular impaction. This study sought to delineate the 
most stable fixation construct in ACPHT fracture patterns in the elderly 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 3 groups of synthetic hemipelves 
(N=15), which were tested in order to compare stiffness by measuring motion at 
fracture lines under applied loads. The three groups of unique quadrilateral 
plate fixation were as follows: a specialty quadrilateral surface plate; 4 long 
peri-articular screws parallel to the quadrilateral surface into the ischium,; 
and an 8 hole infrapectineal buttress plate. Digital imaging system measured 
construct motion under load. Construct stiffness was estimated by linear 
regression of load between 50 and 850N versus average relative motion (average 
of relative motion at 200 points along the line of the osteotomy). Permanent 
deformation was estimated as the magnitude of relative motion upon unloading.
RESULTS: Using ANOVA with Tukey's test to determine construct stiffness in 
loading, the group long peri-articular screws was found to have significantly 
higher stiffness than either of the other groups. Maximal fracture displacement 
was located at the intersection of the low transverse fracture line in the 
posterior column and the free quadrilateral surface fragment.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the best fixation construct for this ACPHT 
acetabular fracture pattern includes independent lag screws across the anterior 
column and a pelvic brim plate with long periarticular screws maximizing 
posterior column fixation and preventing medialization of the free quadrilateral 
fragment. Although there are potential patient considerations that may 
complicate the placement of all 4 long screws, in most patients one or more of 
these screws can be safely placed in order to help prevent secondary 
displacement.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We explored the difference in treatment efficacy of 
endoscopic self-expendable metal stent (SEMS) and surgical bypass (SB) in the 
management of malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) secondary to pancreatic 
cancer.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted using consecutive patients who 
were admitted from 2008 to 2016 receiving either endoscopic SEMS or SB. 
Diagnosis other than pancreatic cancer and SEMS placement as a pre-operative 
drainage before Whipple's operation was excluded. Propensity score (PS) matching 
was performed to eliminate the confounding effect of heterogeneity between 
patients from two treatment groups. The rate of early, late treatment-related 
events, readmission and re-intervention, the duration of hospitalization, and 
the cost of treatment were compared.
RESULTS: There were 98 patients undergoing endoscopic SEMS or SB in the study 
period. The median age was 68.5 years and 52% of the patients had metastatic 
disease with median survival of 6 months. After 1:1 PS matching, 30 patients 
from each group were analyzed. The hospital stay was significantly longer in the 
SB group (13 vs. 5 days, P < 0.001) with a trend of higher rate of early 
treatment-related events (24.1 vs. 6.7%, P = 0.113). None of the patients in SB 
group developed recurrent biliary obstruction. Higher readmission rate (36.7 vs. 
3.3%, P = 0.004) and re-intervention rate (36.7 vs. 10%, P = 0.033) were found 
in the SEMS group. The 3-, 6-, and 9-month re-intervention rates for endoscopic 
SEMS and SB group were 24.9, 29.4, 45.7, and 11.2, 11.2, and 11.2%, respectively 
(P = 0.03). When all subsequent readmissions were taken into account, there was 
no significant difference in hospital stay in both groups (7.5 vs. 14 days, 
P = 0.359); however, the total cost of treatment in SB group was significantly 
higher than that in the SEMS group (13,307 vs. 7113 USD, P = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: Despite being more invasive and expensive, surgical bypass provides 
durable relief of biliary obstruction. Endoscopic SEMS is associated with 
minimal procedural risks and low re-intervention rate, which are important 
considerations for frail patients with limited life expectancy.

Clinical guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes recommend individual 
therapy considering age, duration of disease, presence of complication and risk 
of hypoglycaemia. However, at present, the patient's sex has no impact on 
clinical decisions. Yet, there is mounting data pointing at biological and 
psychosocial differences between men and women with great impact on progression 
of disease and complications. Moreover, choices and preferences of therapeutic 
strategies as well as adherence to lifestyle and pharmacological interventions 
differ in both sexes. In addition, drug therapy may have sex-specific side 
effects. Therefore, there is need of more research on biological differences and 
of evidence-based individualised targeted sex-sensitive therapeutic concepts. 
Clinical guidelines must consider relevant sex-differences. Development and 
implementation of sex-specific programs may help to improve adherence to therapy 
and to reduce progression of disease and development of complications. A more 
gender-sensitive clinical approach may improve quality of life and increase 
health and life expectancy in men and women with type 2 diabetes.

With the progressive increase in life expectancy of HIV-positive patient, thanks 
to "highly active antiretroviral therapy" (HAART), new comorbidities, and 
especially cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are emerging as an important concern. 
An increased risk of coronary artery disease, often in a younger age, has been 
observed in this population. The underlying pathophysiology is complex and 
partially still unclear, with the interaction of viral infection-and systemic 
inflammation-antiretroviral therapy and traditional risk factors. After an 
accurate risk stratification, primary prevention should balance the optimal 
HAART to suppress the virus-avoiding side-effects-the intervention on life-style 
and the treatment of traditional risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and 
diabetes). Also the management after a cardiovascular event is challenging: 
revascularization strategies-both percutaneous and surgical-are valuable 
options, keeping in mind the higher rates of recurrent events, and caution is 
essential to avoid drug-drug interactions. Large evidence-based data on 
HIV-infected patients are still lacking, and recommendations often follow those 
of general population. Therefore we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the 
literature to analyze the current knowledge on CVD's prevalence, prevention and 
treatment in HIV-infected patients.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze whether scar characterization 
could improve the risk stratification for life-threatening ventricular 
arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD).
BACKGROUND: Among patients with a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) 
indication, appropriate defibrillator (CRT-D) therapy rates are low.
METHODS: Primary prevention patients with a class I indication for CRT were 
prospectively enrolled and assigned to CRT-D or CRT pacemaker according to 
physician's criteria. Pre-procedure contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance 
was obtained and analyzed to identify scar presence or absence, quantify the 
amount of core and border zone (BZ), and depict BZ distribution. The presence, 
mass, and characteristics of BZ channels in the scar were recorded. The primary 
endpoint was appropriate defibrillator therapy or SCD.
RESULTS: 217 patients (39.6% ischemic) were included. During a median follow-up 
of 35.5 months (12 to 62 months), the primary endpoint occurred in 25 patients 
(11.5%) and did not occur in patients without myocardial scar. Among patients 
with scar (n = 125, 57.6%), those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD) therapies or SCD exhibited greater scar mass (38.7 ± 34.2 g vs. 17.9 ± 
17.2 g; p < 0.001), scar heterogeneity (BZ mass/scar mass ratio) (49.5 ± 13.0 
vs. 40.1 ± 21.7; p = 0.044), and BZ channel mass (3.6 ± 3.0 g vs. 1.8 ± 3.4 g; 
p = 0.018). BZ mass (hazard ratio: 1.06 [95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.08]; 
p < 0.001) and BZ channel mass (hazard ratio: 1.21 [95% confidence interval: 
1.10 to 1.32]; p < 0.001) were the strongest predictors of the primary endpoint. 
An algorithm based on scar mass and the absence of BZ channels identified 148 
patients (68.2%) without ICD therapy/SCD during follow-up with a 100% negative 
predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence, extension, heterogeneity, and qualitative 
distribution of BZ tissue of myocardial scar independently predict appropriate 
ICD therapies and SCD in CRT patients.

China has become the largest coal consumer and important emitter of trace metals 
in the world. A multiple-year inventory of atmospheric copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) 
emissions from coal combustion in 30 provinces of China and 4 economic sectors 
(power plant, industry sector, residential sector, and others) for the period of 
1995-2014 has been calculated. The results indicated that the total emissions of 
Cu and Zn increased from 5137.70 t and 11484.16 t in 1995-7099.24 t and 
14536.61 t in 2014, at an annual average growth rate of 1.90% and 1.33%, 
respectively. The industrial sector ranked as the leading source, followed by 
power plants, the residential use, and other sectors. The emissions of Cu and Zn 
were predominantly concentrated in the northern and eastern regions of China due 
to the enormous consumption of coal by the industrial and the power sectors. The 
emissions of Cu and Zn were closely associated with mortality and life 
expectancy (LE) on the basis of multiple regression analysis. Spatial 
econometric models suggested that Cu and Zn emissions displayed significantly 
positive relevance with mortality, while they exhibited negative correlation 
with LE. The influence of the Cu emission peaked in the north of China for both 
mortality and LE, while the impacts of the Zn emission on mortality and LE 
reached a maximum value in Xinjiang Province. The results of the grey prediction 
model suggested that the Cu emission would decrease to 5424.73 t, whereas the Zn 
emissions could reach 17402.13 t in 2020. Analysis of more specific data are 
imperative in order to estimate the emissions of both metals, to assess their 
human health effects, and then to adopt effective measures to prevent 
environmental pollution.

BACKGROUND: Early chemotherapy has recently become a new standard of care for 
patients with metastatic castrate-naive prostate cancer (mCNPC). The survival 
benefit is evident in patients with high-volume disease, but less clear in those 
with low-volume disease. Here, we assessed the trade-offs between toxicity and 
survival using a Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease and Toxicity 
of treatment (Q-TWiST) analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis was performed from the data of the 
Genito-Urinary Oncology Group (GETUG)-AFU 15 phase III trial evaluating the 
benefits of docetaxel (D) combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
versus ADT alone in 385 mCNPC patients. Overall survival was partitioned into 
three periods, namely toxic phase of treatment (TOX), time before progression 
without toxicity (TWIST), and progression (PROG). These health states were 
weighted according to patients' utility to determine quality-adjusted survival 
times. In threshold analyses, utility for TOX and PROG were varied from 0 to 1.
RESULTS: A better quality-adjusted survival was found in the ADT + D arm when 
the utility for PROG and TOX states were ≤0.2 and ≥ 0.8, respectively. When the 
utility for PROG was 0.4 or more, ADT + D and ADT alone yielded similar 
quality-adjusted survival. When patients were stratified into high-volume versus 
low-volume disease, we found a significant Q-TWiST benefit in favour of the 
ADT + D arm only for high-volume patients when the utility for PROG was less 
than 0.35, while we found no benefit in low-volume disease patients, whatever 
the coefficients tested.
CONCLUSION: Early docetaxel may provide significant quality-adjusted survival 
benefits for patients with mCNPC, especially those with high-volume disease, 
depending on the values assigned to the times spent in the toxicity phase and 
after PROG. The Q-TWiST methodology is a useful tool for decision-making 
regarding trade-offs between survival, PROG and toxicity.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate which variables present prior and early after stroke 
may have an impact on the level of physical activity (PA) 1 year poststroke.
DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort and logistic regression analysis.
SETTING: Stroke Unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: 117 individuals as part of the Stroke Arm Longitudinal Study 
(SALGOT) admitted to the stroke unit during a period of 18 months were 
consecutively recruited. The inclusion criteria were: first-time stroke, 
impaired upper extremity function, admitted to the stroke unit within 3 days 
since onset, local residency and ≥18 years old. The exclusion criteria were: 
upper extremity condition or severe multi-impairment prior to stroke, short life 
expectancy and non-Swedish speaking. 77 participants followed up at 1 year 
poststroke were included in the analysis.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: PA level 1 year after stroke was assessed using a 6-level 
Saltin-Grimby Scale, which was first dichotomised into mostly inactive or mostly 
active and second into low or moderate/high level of PA.
RESULTS: Being mostly inactive 1 year after stroke could be predicted by age at 
stroke onset (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13, p=0.041), functional dependency at 
discharge (OR 7.01, 95% CI 1.73 to 28.43, p=0.006) and prestroke PA (OR 7.46, 
95% CI 1.51 to 36.82, p=0.014). Having a low level of PA 1 year after stroke 
could be predicted by age at stroke onset (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.21, 
p<0.001) and functional dependency at discharge (OR 3.62, 95% CI 1.09 to 12.04, 
p=0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: Previous low level of PA, older age and functional dependency all 
provided value in predicting low PA 1 year after stroke. These results indicate 
that age and simple clinical evaluations early after stroke may be useful to 
help clinicians identify persons at risk of being insufficiently active after 
stroke. Further research is needed to clarify if these findings may apply to the 
large population of stroke survivors.
