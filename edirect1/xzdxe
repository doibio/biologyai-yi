BACKGROUND: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a small vessel vasculitis 
characterized by lung and kidney involvement. It is typically a disease of white 
females and has a poor prognosis with the average life expectancy of 5 months 
for a patient without treatment. Oral and skin ulcers are considered to be rare 
presentations.
CASE: A 39-year-old black male presented to the hospital with oral and skin 
ulcers and was diagnosed with GPA based on the biopsies of both cutaneous 
lesions and kidney. He was started on rituximab with minimal improvement. Later 
he was admitted to the ICU and had plasmapheresis, and he gradually improved and 
was discharged home 8 days after admission.
CONCLUSION: GPA is an aggressive vascular disorder resulting in possible organ 
system damage and failure. The role of the sickle cell trait in this patient is 
undefined, but this combination of gender, race, and presenting symptoms in GPA 
is extremely unusual.

Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, is one of the 
devastating disease affecting common bean production and productivity worldwide. 
Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for anthracnose resistance have been 
identified. In order to make use of these QTLs in common bean breeding programs, 
a detailed meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis has been conducted. For the MQTL analysis, 
92 QTLs related to anthracnose disease reported in 18 different earlier studies 
involving 16 mapping populations were compiled and projected on to the consensus 
map. This meta-analysis led to the identification of 11 MQTLs (each involving 
QTLs from at least two different studies) on 06 bean chromosomes and 10 QTL 
hotspots each involving multiple QTLs from an individual study on 07 
chromosomes. The confidence interval (CI) of the identified MQTLs was found 3.51 
times lower than the CI of initial QTLs. Marker-trait associations (MTAs) 
reported in published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to 
validate nine of the 11 identified MQTLs, with MQTL4.1 overlapping with as many 
as 40 MTAs. Functional annotation of the 11 MQTL regions revealed 1,251 genes 
including several R genes (such as those encoding for NBS-LRR domain-containing 
proteins, protein kinases, etc.) and other defense related genes. The MQTLs, QTL 
hotspots and the potential candidate genes identified during the present study 
will prove useful in common bean marker-assisted breeding programs and in basic 
studies involving fine mapping and cloning of genomic regions associated with 
anthracnose resistance in common beans.

High pressure chemistry offers the chemical community a range of possibilities 
to control chemical reactivity, develop new materials and fine-tune chemical 
properties. Despite the large changes that extreme pressure brings to the table, 
the field has mainly been restricted to the effects of volume changes and 
thermodynamics with less attention devoted to electronic effects at the 
molecular scale. This paper combines the conceptual DFT framework for analyzing 
chemical reactivity with the XP-PCM method for simulating pressures in the GPa 
range. Starting from the new derivatives of the energy with respect to external 
pressure, an electronic atomic volume and an atomic compressibility are found, 
comparable to their enthalpy analogues, respectively. The corresponding radii 
correlate well with major known sets of this quantity. The ionization potential 
and electron affinity are both found to decrease with pressure using two 
different methods. For the electronegativity and chemical hardness, a decreasing 
and increasing trend is obtained, respectively, and an electronic volume-based 
argument is proposed to rationalize the observed periodic trends. The cube of 
the softness is found to correlate well with the polarizability, both decreasing 
under pressure, while the interpretation of the electrophilicity becomes 
ambiguous at extreme pressures. Regarding the electron density, the radial 
distribution function shows a clear concentration of the electron density 
towards the inner region of the atom and periodic trends can be found in the 
density using the Carbó quantum similarity index and the Kullback-Leibler 
information deficiency. Overall, the extension of the CDFT framework with 
pressure yields clear periodic patterns.

As life expectancy rises and the survival rate after acute cardiovascular events 
improves, the number of people living and dying with chronic heart failure is 
increasing. People suffering from chronic ischemic and non-ischemic heart 
disease may experience a significant limitation of their quality of life which 
can be addressed by palliative care. Although international guidelines recommend 
the implementation of integrated palliative care for patients with heart 
failure, models of care are scarce and are often limited to patients at the end 
of life. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a model designed to 
improve the early integration of palliative care for patients with heart 
failure. This model has enabled patients to access palliative care when they 
normally would not have and given them the opportunity to plan their care in 
line with their values and preferences. However, the effectiveness of this 
interdisciplinary model of care on patients' quality of life and symptom burden 
still requires evaluation.

Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the issue of aging has gained 
international attention. Both developed and developing nations are currently 
dealing with this issue. To ensure the sustained and healthy growth of the 
economy and society in the face of an aging society, it is especially important 
to establish a scientific old-age insurance system and a reasonable retirement 
system. We are all aware that the key indicators for the state to control the 
old-age insurance system in the old-age insurance system are the income and 
expenditure balance of the old-age insurance pooling account and the analysis of 
the ideal retirement age. In this paper, a better machine algorithm is used. By 
independently learning the rules present in a large amount of data and gaining 
new experience and knowledge, machine learning (ML) can increase computer 
intelligence and give computers decision-making abilities comparable to those of 
humans. In general, a machine learning algorithm uses the laws it derives from 
data to predict unknown data after automatically analysing the data. This 
study's findings suggest that the ideal retirement age and life expectancy are 
positively correlated, with the ideal retirement age's growth rate 12.57 percent 
higher than that of life expectancy.

Background: The Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI) provides a comprehensive 
framework for understanding adolescent substance use. Objectives: We examined 
mechanisms by which a TTI-guided social-emotional and character development 
program, Positive Action (PA), influences adolescent substance use. Study data 
come from the PA-Chicago, longitudinal matched-pairs cluster-randomized control 
trial. A diverse, dynamic cohort of approximately 1,200 students from 14 
low-performing schools were assessed at eight points of time, between grades 
3-8, across a six-year period. Students completed scales related to substance 
use, self-control, deviant peer affiliation, and school attachment, adapted from 
the Risk Behavior Survey, Social-Emotional and Character Development Scale, 
Conventional Friends Scale, and People in My Life Scale. After testing the 
overall effect of PA on substance use, we used latent growth modeling to assess 
whether effects on each outcome were mediated by longitudinal changes in three 
composite measures aligning with the TTIs three streams. Results: Students in PA 
schools reported fewer experiences with drinking, getting drunk, and overall 
substance use. In the multiple mediator models, significant indirect effects of 
PA on substance use via changes in self-control were evident. 
Conclusions/Importance: Findings are consistent with theory and past research 
suggesting the influence of self-control on youth substance use. Future studies 
should include implementation in different settings and additional theory-based 
measures.Trial RegistrationThis trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov

Treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma in 2022: improved treatment regimens and 
improved prognosis.

Reichstein D(1), Brock A(1), Lietman C(2), McKean M(2).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Until recently, metastatic uveal melanoma was associated with 
essentially uniform fatality within months. However, recent developments in 
screening, improved understanding of the genetic underpinnings of metastatic 
disease, and pivotal medication approvals have improved the disease's rate of 
fatality.
RECENT FINDINGS: Routine implementation of genetic testing at the time of 
primary tumor treatment via gene expression profiling or chromosomal analysis 
has identified patients who are at high risk for metastatic disease. Enhanced 
screening with imaging directed at the liver and lungs has allowed for 
identification of early disease and lower tumor burden. Significant work on 
improved liver directed therapy along with systemic chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy has improved life expectancy. The first systemic immunotherapy 
specifically for metastatic uveal melanoma was approved this year. This 
medication, tebentafusp, is likely to improve life expectancy for all patients 
with metastatic melanoma assuming they have appropriate human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) markers. Multiple clinical trials with novel immunotherapeutic agents are 
promising as well.
SUMMARY: The prognosis for patients with uveal melanoma is far better than ever 
before because of recent developments in the understanding and treatment of 
metastatic disease.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease that emerged in 
2019. This disease is causing devastating health, socio-economic, and economic 
crises. More specifically COVID-19 is affecting both the quality and length of 
human life. The overall health impact of this disease is measured by the 
disability-adjusted life years which is the sum of the life years lost due to 
disability (the effect on the health quality) and the years life lost due to 
premature death (effect on the length of life). The purpose of this review is to 
summarise DALYs-based health impact publications and produce compiled and 
informative literature that can aid the health regulators to make evidence-based 
decisions on mitigating COVID-19.
METHODS: The review will be conducted using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The 
DALYs-based original observational and cross-sectional studies will be collected 
for assessing the health impact of COVID-19. Both the life quality and length 
impacts of COVID-19 will be reviewed. The life quality impact of COVID-19 will 
be measured using the life years lost due to disability (pre-recovery illness, 
pre-death illness, and post-acute consequences), and its impact on the length of 
life will be measured with years of life lost due to premature death (shortening 
of life expectancy). The combined health impact of COVID-19 on the quality and 
length of life will be measured in disability-adjusted life years.
DISCUSSION: The impacts of COVID-19 on the two health outcomes (quality and 
length of life) will indicate the level of COVID-19 health burden. The increase 
or decrease of COVID-19 health impact might be due to the sample size 
differences of different studies and the omission of years lost due to 
post-acute consequences in some studies. After having a summarized systematic 
review health decision-makers will apply an impact-based response to COVID-19.

Academy of Sciences.

The metabolic syndrome is currently becoming more common. It is a significant 
public health concern as it is epidemic affecting populations in many regions of 
the world. In Magadan region no research has been carried out to study the 
frequency of components of the metabolic syndrome among northerners. This survey 
was performed to assess the occurrence of the main and additional components of 
the metabolic syndrome among 17 to 74 year old residents of the Northern region. 
Two hundred and forty north born Caucasians participated in the study: male 
subjects at their young age, working age, and retirement age, all belonging to 
the territory of Magadan region. We used photometric, immunochemiluminescent 
research methods, as well as standard methods for assessing body mass index and 
cardiovascular system. The metabolic syndrome factors were determined in 
accordance with the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program 
(NCEP), the Adult Treatment Program III (ATP III), the International Diabetes 
Federation (IDF), and the Consensus of International Experts in Cardiology and 
Endocrinology. We analyzed five main components of the metabolic syndrome 
(overweight, carbohydrate metabolic impairments hypertension, 
hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalphacholesterolemia) and three additional components 
(presence of insulin resistance, purine metabolism disorder, deficient and 
insufficient concentrations of vitamin D). Combinations of the components were 
also studied through the examined age groups. According to the ATP III, NCEP and 
IDF criteria, the metabolic syndrome was more common in elderly subjects (47%) 
than in working age (21%) or young examinees (3%). Older males tended to exhibit 
higher frequency of both the main and additional factors of metabolic syndrome. 
The total index of the occurrence of metabolic syndrome factors in the group of 
young men was 101%; in the group of men of working age - 180%, and in men of 
retirement age - 274%. The results on occurrence of the metabolic syndrome 
components observed in the surveyed groups of northerners can make an 
information data base, which we assume can be applied when planning and carrying 
out scientifically grounded preventive measures, which will improve subjective 
quality of life and its expectancy under the North conditions.

We revisit the identities of Trimeresurus albolabris records from India and 
Nepal, based on a re-examination of historically mentioned specimens. Based on 
morphological congruence, we identify an old specimen originally labeled as T. 
albolabris from Nagpur, Central Province as Trimeresurus salazar. We also 
provide new records of T. salazar based on molecular data from newly collected 
specimens in Central India. As the range of T. salazar is now known to approach 
that of its sister species Trimeresurus septentrionalis, we also redescribe T. 
septentrionalis based on the holotype and referred material. Finally, we 
examined two historical specimens from Madras collected during the Novara 
Expedition, which we identify as T. davidi, leading to a reassessment of their 
origin. Consequently, we remove T. albolabris from the list of Indian snake 
fauna.

A new ant-like spider species of the subfamily Castianeirinae, Mazax akephaloi 
sp. nov., representing the second species of Mazax recorded from South America, 
is described from the Bolivian orocline and the Paraguayan Chaco region. The new 
species superficially resembles Mazax ramirezi Rubio Daniman, 2014, but can be 
distinguished from this species and all other congeners by a combination of the 
following characters: feathery setae on the carapace, a tibia I spine formula of 
54 in males and 55 in females, the embolus sub-apical with a spatulate 
extension, the lung-shaped spermathecae II and slightly undulating copulatory 
ducts. Adults of M. akephaloi sp. nov. were observed foraging in association 
with workers of the ant Ectatomma permagnum Forel, 1908 on the ground or leaf 
litter along forest edges. Although the spiders were lacking a structure 
imitating the head of the ants, they shared several characters (dark brown 
integument with distinct, coarse wrinkles and shiny reflections, abdomen 
anteriorly with dorsally pointing process and distinct median constriction) that 
increased the species-specific similarity to their potential ant models.

OBJECTIVES: Stroke is the most common cause of disability in high-income 
countries. Several countries offer a limited range of advanced treatments with 
implications for outcomes, disability and costs. This study estimates the burden 
of disability that could have been avoided through the transition from 
traditional (no intravenous thrombolytic therapy (IVT), or endovascular 
thrombectomy (EVT)) to modern stroke treatments (treatment in stroke units, IVT 
and EVT). We perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing best practice with 
traditional stroke care, using Greece as a case study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate costs and Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for each treatment strategy, using a lifetime 
horizon. Data for model inputs were derived from meta-analyses of trials, and 
national and international cost databases. Sensitivity analyses were also 
performed to address potential uncertainty and test the robustness of the 
findings.
RESULTS: Incremental effectiveness comprised 0.22 QALYs per patient and year. 
Best practice was cost-effective for more than 90% of all iterations (ICER for 
the baseline scenario: €2,109.25/QALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
the findings remain robust. Considering the stroke incidence in Greece, the 
annual additional cost to implement best practice was calculated to be between 
0.07%-0.15% of the total health expenditure.
CONCLUSION: Best practice stroke treatment was cost-effective and affordable in 
a case study based on Greece. The results could be leveraged by including 
effects of preventive policies and rehabilitation. They also highlight the 
importance of adopting modern treatment strategies from a cost-effectiveness 
perspective, apart from the improved clinical outcomes.

PURPOSE: To establish intra- and inter-session reliability of high-density 
surface electromyography (HDEMG)-derived parameters from the thoracic erector 
spinae (ES) during static and dynamic goal-directed voluntary movements of the 
trunk, and during functional reaching tasks.
METHODS: Twenty participants performed: 1) static trunk extension, 2) dynamic 
trunk forward and lateral flexion, and 3) multidirectional functional reaching 
tasks on two occasions separated by 7.5 ± 1.2 days. Muscle activity was recorded 
bilaterally from the thoracic ES. Root mean square (RMS), coordinates of the 
barycentre, mean frequency (MNF), and entropy were derived from the HDEMG 
signals. Reliability was determined with intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC), coefficient of variation, and standard error of measurement.
RESULTS: Good-to-excellent intra-session reliability was found for all 
parameters and tasks (ICC: 0.79-0.99), whereas inter-session reliability varied 
across tasks. Static tasks demonstrated higher reliability in most parameters 
compared to functional and dynamic tasks. Absolute RMS and MNF showed the 
highest overall reliability across tasks (ICC: 0.66-0.98), while reliability of 
the barycentre was influenced by the direction of the movements.
CONCLUSION: RMS and MNF derived from HDEMG show consistent inter-session 
reliability in goal-directed voluntary movements of the trunk and reaching 
tasks, whereas the measures of the barycentre and entropy demonstrate 
task-dependent reliability.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy has been increasing in recent decades. Therefore, 
it is important to understand the functional changes during healthy ageing. Most 
research has mainly focused on one linguistic domain at a time. The current 
study aimed at investigating whether changes in language performance in healthy 
ageing occur in some language domains more than in others.
METHODS: Twenty-three older healthy Hebrew-speaking adults, exhibiting no 
cognitive decline, were examined on tasks aimed at testing their performance in 
different language and cognitive domains: lexical retrieval, complementation 
information, syntax, theory of mind (a domain related to pragmatic aspects of 
language), and short-term memory. We compared their performance at both the 
group and the individual levels. Comparisons were made between the performance 
of the older adults and control data of young adults, and between the older 
adults' performance in the different linguistic domains. In addition, 
correlations between the older adults' phonological short-term memory abilities 
and their performance in various linguistic domains were examined.
RESULTS: A decline was found in several linguistic domains among the older 
adults, while in other domains no decline was found. However, no unequivocal 
decline in linguistic functioning was found due to relatively large variance in 
their performance.
CONCLUSION: Not all linguistic domains are equally vulnerable in ageing, and not 
all older adults are equally affected. The research has both clinical and 
theoretical implications.

Housefly, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), is an important insect-pest 
owing to its disease transmitting capability in both humans and animals e.g. 
diarrhea, gastroenteritis diseases, lumpy skin disease, cholera. Residual 
insecticides are widely used to control houseflies that pose serious threat to 
human and animal health as well as to the environment. The population resurgence 
after insecticidal spray is also a common problem in many cases. 
Transgenerational studies can be very helpful to see the fate of insecticidal 
sprays. In the current study, we determined transgenerational effects of 
sublethal doses of diafenthiuron using Age-stage two-sex life table analysis, 
while focusing on potential use of diafenthiuron in baits. After treating adult 
flies with three different doses of diafenthiuron viz. LC10, LC20 and LC50, the 
progeny depicted significant changes regarding pre-adult duration (shorter in 
control), male and female longevity of their progeny were observed (more adult 
longevity in control). Additionally, population growth parameters viz. intrinsic 
rate of growth (r) (-0.03-0.12 per day), net reproductive rate (R0) (0.50-9.98), 
limiting rate of growth (λ) (0.96-1.13 per day) were also significantly reduced 
in the progeny of treated adults. Based on the decreased biotic potential i.e. 
intrinsic rate of growth and other population parameters, diafenthiuron can be 
recommended as an effective insecticide even at lower doses.

The energy metabolism of tumor cells is considered one of the hallmarks of 
cancer because it is different from normal cells and mainly consists of aerobic 
glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutaminolysis. It is about one hundred 
years ago since Warburg observed that cancer cells prefer aerobic glycolysis 
even in normoxic conditions, favoring their high proliferation rate. A pivotal 
enzyme driving this phenomenon is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and this review 
describes prognostic and therapeutic opportunities associated with this enzyme, 
focussing on tumors with limited therapeutic strategies and life expectancy 
(i.e., pancreatic and thoracic cancers). Expression levels of LDH-A in 
pancreatic cancer tissues correlate with clinicopathological features: LDH-A is 
overexpressed during pancreatic carcinogenesis and showed significantly higher 
expression in more aggressive tumors. Similarly, LDH levels are a marker of 
negative prognosis in patients with both adenocarcinoma or squamous cell lung 
carcinoma, as well as in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Additionally, serum LDH 
levels may play a key role in the clinical management of these diseases because 
they are associated with tissue damage induced by tumor burden. Lastly, we 
discuss the promising results of strategies targeting LDH as a treatment 
strategy, reporting recent preclinical and translational studies supporting the 
use of LDH-inhibitors in combinations with current/novel chemotherapeutics that 
can synergistically target the oxygenated cells present in the tumor.

From Life Span to Health Span: Declaring "Victory" in the Pursuit of Human 
Longevity.

A difficult dilemma has presented itself in the current era. Modern medicine and 
advances in the medical sciences are tightly focused on a quest to find ways to 
extend life-without considering either the consequences of success or the best 
way to pursue it. From the perspective of physicians treating their patients, it 
makes sense to help them overcome immediate health challenges, but further life 
extension in increasingly more aged bodies will expose the saved population to 
an elevated risk of even more disabling health conditions associated with aging. 
Extended survival brought forth by innovations designed to treat diseases will 
likely push more people into a "red zone"-a later phase in life when the risk of 
frailty and disability rises exponentially. The inescapable conclusion from 
these observations is that life extension should no longer be the primary goal 
of medicine when applied to long-lived populations. The principal outcome and 
most important metric of success should be the extension of health span, and the 
technological advances described herein that are most likely to make the 
extension of healthy life possible.

Utilizing economic tools, we evaluate the gains from improving the relationship 
between biological and chronological age in dollar terms. We show that the gains 
to individuals are substantial because targeting aging exploits synergies 
between health and life expectancy and the complementarities across different 
diseases. Gains are boosted by improvements in life expectancy and a rising 
number of older people. We compute the value of slowing aging in a range of 
countries and estimate that increasing life expectancy by 1 year has an annual 
benefit of ∼4%-5% of gross domestic product (GDP). Augmenting GDP with these 
measures of health gains reveals the growing importance of achieving healthy 
longevity as a means of boosting welfare, with the need being particularly acute 
in the United States.

BACKGROUND: Persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) have higher risk of mortality 
compared with the general population. Longitudinal studies are important for 
understanding the evolution of survival in pwMS.
OBJECTIVE: Examine changes in mortality among pwMS during the past seven 
decades.
METHODS: We followed pwMS from Hordaland and Møre and Romsdal in Western Norway, 
with disease onset from before 1950, identified from population-based 
epidemiological surveys and the Norwegian MS Registry and Biobank, until 1 
January 2021. Data were linked to the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry to 
obtain underlying cause of death. We examined all-cause, and cause-specific 
mortality using standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and excess death rates 
(EDR). We calculated life expectancies and assessed survival stratified by sex, 
age and disease phenotype at onset. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) for 
mortality, in pwMS diagnosed before and after the era of disease-modifying 
treatment (DMT).
RESULTS: Of 3624 pwMS, 964 (55.5% women) had died, predominantly of multiple 
sclerosis (49.0%). Median life expectancy for pwMS was 74.3 years (95% CI 73.3 
to 75.3), compared with 83.1 years for the general population (p<0.001). From 
disease onset, pwMS survived 14.6 years shorter than the general population 
(p<0.001). Overall, SMR was 2.3 (95% CI 2.13 to 2.42) and EDR was 6.8 (95% CI 
6.42 to 7.09) for pwMS. Treatment-eligible pwMS diagnosed in the DMT era had the 
lowest risk of mortality, HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.70,p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Excess mortality among pwMS declined during the past seven decades, 
possibly due to improved diagnostics, better symptomatic treatment and access to 
DMTs.

BACKGROUND: Laws that regulate healthcare practice at the end of life reflect 
the values of the society where they apply. Traditionally, healthcare 
professionals rely on their clinical knowledge to inform treatment decisions, 
but the extent to which the law also informs health professionals' 
decision-making at the end of life is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe what healthcare 
professionals working in emergency departments and intensive care units know 
about the law that relates to end-of-life decision-making for hospitalised 
adults and what affects its application.
REVIEW METHOD: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews.
DATA SOURCES: Data were sourced by searching the following databases: Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL [via EBSCOhost]), Nursing 
and Allied Health and Health and Medical Collection (via ProQuest Central), 
Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), PubMed, PsycINFO, and HeinOnline.
RESULTS: Systematic screening of the search results and application of inclusion 
criteria resulted in the identification of 18 quantitative and three qualitative 
articles that were reviewed, summarised, and reported. Ten of the quantitative 
studies assessed knowledge and attitudes to law or end-of-life decision-making 
using hypothetical scenarios or vignettes. Qualitative studies focussed on how 
the law was applied when end-of-life decisions were made. End-of-life 
decision-making is mostly based on the clinical needs of the patient, with the 
law having a secondary role.
CONCLUSION: Around the world, there are significant gaps in healthcare 
professionals' legal knowledge. Clinical factors are considered more important 
to end-of-life decision-making than legal factors. End-of-life decision-making 
is perceived to carry legal risk, and this results in the provision of 
nonbeneficial end-of-life care. Further qualitative research is needed to 
ascertain the clinician-related factors that affect the integration of law with 
end-of-life decision-making.

The impact of genetic variation on overall disease burden has not been 
comprehensively evaluated. We introduce an approach to estimate the effect of 
genetic risk factors on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; 'lost healthy 
life years'). We use genetic information from 735,748 individuals and consider 
80 diseases. Rare variants had the highest effect on DALYs at the individual 
level. Among common variants, rs3798220 (LPA) had the strongest individual-level 
effect, with 1.18 DALYs from carrying 1 versus 0 copies. Being in the top 10% 
versus the bottom 90% of a polygenic score for multisite chronic pain had an 
effect of 3.63 DALYs. Some common variants had a population-level effect 
comparable to modifiable risk factors such as high sodium intake and low 
physical activity. Attributable DALYs vary between males and females for some 
genetic exposures. Genetic risk factors can explain a sizable number of healthy 
life years lost both at the individual and population level.
