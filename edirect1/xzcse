Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the USA, yet is 
highly preventable and detectable at an early stage through screening. Virginia 
Cooperative Extension (VCE) implemented a worksite colon cancer awareness 
program to increase colorectal cancer screening rates and preventive lifestyle 
behaviors among its employees. The Colon Cancer-Free Zone program is designed 
using best practice principles of worksite health programs and includes 
information sessions covering the topics of colorectal cancer, screening 
guidelines, insurance coverage, and preventive lifestyle behaviors. It is 
conducted in a campaign format that includes a strategic communication strategy 
targeting relevant screening barriers and facilitators, peer champions, and 
incentives. The program was implemented with VCE employees statewide utilizing a 
web-based system for the information sessions, and resulted in broad 
participation, a significant increase in screening self-efficacy (4.15 ± 0.64 vs 
3.81 ± 0.76, ρ = 0.006), changes in diet and physical activity (50% and 40% of 
participants, respectively), and a 20.6% increase in the employee colorectal 
cancer screening rate. A Colon Cancer-Free Zone toolkit was developed for use by 
Extension Agents to implement the program at worksites in their service 
communities.

OBJECTIVE: Screening for hepatitis C in Russia is a complex process that 
involves several visits and stepwise testing, limiting adherence and 
substantially reducing the yield in the identification of active infections. We 
aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screening algorithms from 
a health system perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was applied to a hypothetical adult 
population eligible to participate in a general screening program for hepatitis 
C in Russia. The standard pathway (I: Screen for anti-HCV antibodies followed by 
a nucleic acid test for HCV RNA on antibody positives) was compared to three 
alternatives (II: Screen for antibodies, a reflexed test for HCV antigen on 
antibody positives, and RNA on antigen negatives; III: Screen for antibodies, a 
reflexed test for HCV antigen on antibody positives; IV: Screen for antigen). 
Each strategy considered a cascade of events (referral, adherence, testing, 
diagnosis) that must occur for screening to be effective. The primary measure of 
effectiveness was the number of diagnosed active infections. Calculations 
followed a health system perspective with costs derived from 2017 reimbursement 
rates and a willingness-to-pay of 2,000RUB ($82) per diagnosed active infection. 
Model was tested with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Non-adherence to screening stages reduced the capture rate of active 
infections in Strategy I from 79.0% to 40.6%. Strategies II, III, and IV were 
less affected and identified 69%, 67%, and 104% more infections. Average costs 
per diagnosed infection were decreased by 41% from 89,599RUB ($3,681) for I to 
53,072RUB ($2,180), 53,004RUB ($2,177), and 59,633RUB ($2,450) for II, III, and 
IV, respectively. With a probability of 97%, Strategy III was most 
cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio vs. I of -1,373RUB 
(CI: -5,011RUB to -2,033RUB; $-56; CI: -$206 to -$84). Below a 
willingness-to-pay of 91,000RUB ($3,738), Strategy IV was not cost-effective. 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing strategies for hepatitis C with HCV antigen on HCV antibody 
positive cases offer a streamlining opportunity for population screening 
programs. Those shall increase the chances for detecting active infections and 
are cost-effective over current practice in Russia.

Scabies is an ectoparasitic dermatosis caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis 
and is a public health issue in all countries regardless of socioeconomic 
status. In high-income countries, delays in diagnosis can lead to institutional 
outbreaks; in low- and middle-income countries, poor access to health care 
contributes to disease undertreatment and long-term systemic sequelae. With 
scabies now recognized as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health 
Organization, increased awareness and systematic efforts are addressing gaps in 
diagnosis and treatment that impede scabies control. This review summarizes the 
available data and provides an update on scabies epidemiology, clinical 
features, diagnosis, management, and public health considerations.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the strength of preferences, relative importance and 
trade-offs that patients with type 2 diabetes make between characteristics of 
antihyperglycemic medications.
METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment with a sample of Canadians 
with type 2 diabetes. Respondents completed 14 choice tasks and choose between 2 
hypothetical drug alternatives, described by 8 characteristics (cost, efficacy, 
life expectancy, risk of macrovascular event, risk of microvascular event, risk 
of severe hypoglycemia, risk of minor side effects and risk of rare but serious 
side effects). An opt-out option was also provided. Characteristics used to 
describe the 2 drugs were identified using a literature review, focus groups and 
interviews. A multinomial mixed logit model was used to estimate choice 
probabilities. Willingness to pay (WTP) was used to assess trade-offs between 
characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 502 survey responses were included. The average age of 
participants was 59±12 years. Participants were 59% men, and 62% had diabetes 
for at least 6 years. All characteristics were found to significantly influence 
choice. On average, patients were willing to pay a monthly cost for their 
therapy of $134 to achieve 3 additional years of life; $49 and $36 for a 20% 
reduction in their risk of macrovascular and microvascular events, respectively; 
$34 for a 1% drop in glycated hemoglobin; $29 for a 50% less risk of severe 
hypoglycemia over 10 years; $29 for a 50% less risk of a minor side effect and 
$17 for a 50% less risk of a rare but serious side effect over 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: All 8 characteristics were shown to significantly influence choice, 
with cost and life expectancy carrying the most weight and serious and minor 
side effects carrying the least weight.

The study of mortality enables to identify the major public health problems in 
the countries under consideration. It can give an indication on the preventive 
and "medico-curative" measures as well as on the investments in research that 
could increase life expectancy of the population. This study aims to evaluate 
the causes of death in the general population based on the informations 
contained in the register of deaths in Dakar. Our specific aim was to determine 
the causes of death, to identify the socio-demographic factors influencing death 
and to identify the kinds of death and types of death. We conducted a 
retrospective study on the cases of death in the general population who 
underwent an autopsy in Dakar, from 2003 to 2012. Data were taken from the 
autopsy registers from the Aristide Le Dantec Hospital (HALD) and the General 
Hospital of Grand Yoff (HOGGY), which are the only hospitals in Dakar where 
autopsies are made. The informations contained in the different data sources 
were recorded on a survey form and analyzed using Epi-Info 6.04. During the 
study period, 985 patients died among whom 693 of violent death (70.3%), 261 of 
natural death (26.5%), and 14 of unspecified cause (1.4%). There was a 
predominance of traffic accidents (394; 40%). With respect to the kind of death, 
more than half of the cases were due to traffic accidents (violent deaths). 
Traffic-related deaths most often occurred during the pre-hospitalization period 
or on arrival to the hospital. The Ministry of Health should continue to promote 
measures for preventing and managing communicable diseases. The two priorities 
should be as follows: cardiovascular diseases and traumas.

L'étude de la mortalité permet d'identifier les principaux problèmes de santé 
publique des pays dont ils émanent. Elle donne une idée des mesures préventives 
et médico-curatives et des investissements dans la recherche qui pourraient 
accroître l'espérance de vie de la population. L'objectif général de ce travail 
était d'évaluer les causes de mort dans la population générale à partir des 
informations figurant sur les registres de décès à Dakar. Les objectifs 
spécifiques étaient de déterminer les causes de mort, d'identifier les facteurs 
sociodémographiques influençant les décès et d'identifier les genres de mort et 
type de mort. Il s'agit d'une étude rétrospective portant sur les cas de décès 
dans la population générale de Dakar, de 2003 à 2012, ayant bénéficié d'une 
autopsie. Les sources des données étaient les registres des autopsies de 
l'Hôpital Aristide le Dantec (HALD) et de l'Hôpital Général de Grand-Yoff 
(HOGGY), seuls hôpitaux de Dakar où sont effectuées des autopsies. Les 
informations contenues dans les différentes sources de données ont été 
rapportées sur une fiche d'enquête analysée par Epi-info version 6.04. Durant la 
période d'étude, nous trouvions 985 décès parmi lesquels, 693 morts violentes 
(70,3%), 261 morts naturelles (26,5%) et 14 morts indéterminées (1,4%). Il y 
avait une prédominance des accidents de la circulation au nombre de 394 (40%). 
Concernant le genre de mort, plus de la moitié des cas de décès étaient 
accidentels donc des morts violentes. Les décès par accident de la circulation 
se passaient le plus souvent en zone préhospitalière ou à l'arrivée à l'hôpital. 
Le ministère de la santé devra continuer les efforts sur la prévention et la 
prise en charge des maladies transmissibles. Les deux priorités devront être les 
maladies cardiovasculaires et les traumatismes.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, and genetic profiling helps 
to individualize adjuvant treatment. The Oncotype DX is a validated test to 
predict benefit of adjuvant systemic treatment. The aims of this study are to 
determine the costs of chemotherapy in government hospitals in Turkey and 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Oncotype DX from the national insurance 
perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to make long term 
projections of distant recurrence, survival, quality adjusted life expectancy, 
and direct costs for patients with ER+, HER2-, node-negative or up to 3 
node-positive early stage breast cancer. Turkish decision impact study patient 
data were captured for model reference. In that study, ten academic centers 
across Turkey participated in a prospective trial. Of 165 patients with pT1-3, 
pN0-N1mic, ER-positive, and HER-2 negative tumors, 57% had low recurrence score 
(RS), 35% had intermediate RS, and 8% had high RS, respectively. The overall 
rate of change in chemotherapy treatment decisions following Oncotype DX was 
33%.
RESULTS: The cost of adjuvant chemotherapy in public hospitals was estimated at 
$3.649, and Oncotype Dx test was $5.141. Based on the cost-effectiveness 
analysis, Oncotype DX testing was estimated to improve life expectancy (+0.86 
years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (+0.68 QALYs) versus standard care. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) of Oncotype DX was estimated to 
be $7207.9 per QALY gained and $5720.6 per LY gained versus current clinical 
practice.
CONCLUSION: As Oncotype DX was found both cost-effective and life-saving from a 
national perspective, the test should be introduced to standard care in patients 
with ER+, HER-2 negative early-stage breast cancer in Turkey.

INTRODUCTION: Prophylactic treatment of severe hemophilia A is burdensome, 
requiring frequent intravenous injections. Extended half-life (EHL) factor VIII 
replacement therapies offer longer intervals between infusions while still 
meeting efficacy and safety outcomes; however, patient perspectives following 
long-term use of such products in the real-world remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the importance of infusion frequency and the 
potential benefits of reduced infusion frequency among patients receiving 
prophylactic treatment with an EHL product (BAY 94-9027).
METHODS: Patients with severe hemophilia A participating in the PROTECT VIII 
extension study were invited to participate in a semi-structured, concept 
elicitation 'exit' interview to discuss their experiences. Participants were 
recruited from Israel, The Netherlands, and the US. Interview transcripts were 
translated into English and analyzed using thematic analysis methods.
RESULTS: Sixteen participants (29-68 years of age) infusing with BAY 94-9027 
once every 7 days, once every 5 days, or twice weekly were interviewed. 
Participants reported infusion frequency (alongside efficacy) as the most 
important treatment attribute influencing their satisfaction with therapy. 
Patient-reported benefits of reduced infusion frequency and longer duration of 
factor coverage included greater ability to participate in physical activities; 
better vein health; less time to schedule and administer factor VIII; reduced 
impact on work; and improved emotional well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides rich insights into the experiences of patients 
with EHL products and the value of reduced infusion frequency. Such data could 
be of value to a range of stakeholders (e.g. regulators, payers) and facilitate 
patient-clinician discussions to promote tailored treatment decisions.

INTRODUCTION: Demographic changes since the second half of the last century have 
led to an aging population, and this is considered an important economic and 
social problem worldwide. In addition to the social, economic, and political 
effects of aging, the relationship between aging and health expenditure is also 
being recognized in recent years. The two main generally accepted underlying 
causes of aging populations are longer life expectancy and lower fertility. 
Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the main causes of aging and the 
relationship between health expenditure and aging using causality econometric 
models on data samples from Turkey.
METHODS: The Toda and Yamamoto causality approach, which is currently the 
preferred method, was chosen to obtain robust results on dual causality 
relationships between aging, fertility, life expectancy, and health 
expenditures. The data used in the estimation of causality were obtained from 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics for 
Turkey, and the E-Views 8.0 econometric package program was used to predict 
causality.
RESULTS: According to causality analysis, fertility rate resulted in population 
aging in Turkey for the period between 1975 and 2016, apart from a one-way 
causality between population aging and health expenditure in Turkey.
CONCLUSION: As aging has multiple social, political, and economic effects, the 
development and implementation of new policies toward the elderly and aging of 
population are very important.

Sydney, Sydney, Australia.
(2)Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Institute, Sydney Medical School, The 
University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to systematically map the literature reporting on 
oral health outcomes experienced by people with cerebral palsy.
INTRODUCTION: At present, there are no documented systematic reviews reporting 
on oral health outcomes for people of all ages with cerebral palsy. 
Subsequently, there are no clear guidelines, frameworks or detailed oral health 
recommendations for people with cerebral palsy. Considering the importance of 
oral health on general well-being and quality of life, it is important that it 
is not overlooked when focusing on patient-centered care for people with 
cerebral palsy.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that focus on oral health, including dental 
diagnosis, trauma and/or treatment, facial pain, saliva, and sleep apnea, and/or 
make statements regarding oral health pertaining to cerebral palsy will be 
considered for inclusion inthis scoping review.
METHODS: This review will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines 
outlined by JBI methodology for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR). Articles published in any language will be considered for 
inclusion, with no restriction on publication date. The search databases will 
include the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and Dentistry and 
Oral Science. A search of gray literature will also be conducted. Extracted data 
relevant to the scoping review will be performed by two reviewers.

Aims: Productivity losses related to premature cancer mortality have been 
assessed for most developed countries but results for Russia are limited to 
cross-sectional reports. The aim of this study was to quantify productivity 
costs due to cancer mortality in Russia between 2001 and 2015 and project this 
to 2030. Methods: Cancer mortality data (2001-2015) were acquired from the State 
Cancer Registry, whereas population data, labour force participation rates and 
annual earnings were retrieved from the Federal State Statistics Service. Cancer 
mortality was projected to 2030 and the human capital approach was applied to 
estimate productivity losses. Results: The total annual losses increased from 
US6.5b in 2001-2005 to US$8.1b in 2011-2015, corresponding to 0.24% of the 
annual gross domestic product. The value is expected to remain high in 2030 
(US$7.5b, 0.14% of gross domestic product). Productivity losses per cancer death 
are predicted to grow faster in women (from US$18,622 to US$22,386) than in men 
(from US$25,064 to US$28,459). Total losses were found to be highest for breast 
cancer in women (US$0.6b, 20% of overall losses in women) and lung cancer in men 
(US$1.2b, 24%). The absolute predicted change of annual losses between 2011-2015 
and 2026-2030 was greatest for cervix uteri (+US$214m) in women and for lip, 
oral and pharyngeal cancers in men (+US$182m). Conclusions: In Russia, 
productivity losses due to premature cancer mortality are substantial. Given the 
expected importance especially for potentially preventable cancers, steps to 
implement effective evidence-based national cancer control policies are urgently 
required.

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) damage human activities and health. While there is 
wide literature on economic losses, little is known about the economic impact on 
human health. In this review, we systematically retrieved papers which presented 
health costs following exposure to HABs. A systematic review was conducted up to 
January 2019 in databases such as ScienceDirect and PubMed, and 16 studies were 
selected. Health costs included healthcare and medication expenses, loss of 
income due to illness, cost of pain and suffering, and cost of death. Two 
categories of illness (digestive and respiratory) were considered for health 
costs. For digestive illness cost, we found $86, $1,015 and $12,605, 
respectively, for mild, moderate and severe cases. For respiratory illness, 
costs were $86, $1,235 and $14,600, respectively, for mild, moderate and severe 
cases. We used Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to access the loss of 
well-being due to illness caused by HABs. We found that breathing difficulty 
causes the most loss of QALYs, especially in children, with a loss of between 
0.16 and 0.771 per child. Having gastroenteritis could cause a loss of between 
2.2 and 7.1 QALYs per 1,000 children. Misleading symptoms of illness following 
exposure to HABs could cause bias in health costs estimations.

This open access book visualizes mortality dynamics in the Lexis diagram. While 
the standard approach of plotting death rates is also covered, the focus in this 
book is on the depiction of rates of mortality improvement over age and time. 
This rather novel approach offers a more intuitive understanding of the 
underlying dynamics, enabling readers to better understand whether period- or 
cohort-effects were instrumental for the development of mortality in a 
particular country. Besides maps for single countries, the book includes maps on 
the dynamics of selected causes of death in the United States, such as 
cardiovascular diseases or lung cancer. The book also features maps for 
age-specific contributions to the change in life expectancy, for cancer survival 
and for seasonality in mortality for selected causes of death in the United 
States. The book is accompanied by instructions on how to use the freely 
available R Software to produce these types of surface maps. Readers are 
encouraged to use the presented tools to visualize other demographic data or any 
event that can be measured by age and calendar time, allowing them to adapt the 
methods to their respective research interests. The intended audience is anyone 
who is interested in visualizing data by age and calendar time; no specialist 
knowledge is required.

This open access book aims to provide a comprehensive but practical overview of 
the knowledge required for the assessment and management of the older adult with 
or at risk of fragility fracture. It considers this from the perspectives of all 
of the settings in which this group of patients receive nursing care. Globally, 
a fragility fracture is estimated to occur every 3 seconds. This amounts to 25 
000 fractures per day or 9 million per year. The financial costs are reported to 
be: 32 billion EUR per year in Europe and 20 billon USD in the United States. As 
the population of China ages, the cost of hip fracture care there is likely to 
reach 1.25 billion USD by 2020 and 265 billion by 2050 (International 
Osteoporosis Foundation 2016). Consequently, the need for nursing for patients 
with fragility fracture across the world is immense. Fragility fracture is one 
of the foremost challenges for health care providers, and the impact of each one 
of those expected 9 million hip fractures is significant pain, disability, 
reduced quality of life, loss of independence and decreased life expectancy. 
There is a need for coordinated, multi-disciplinary models of care for secondary 
fracture prevention based on the increasing evidence that such models make a 
difference. There is also a need to promote and facilitate high quality, 
evidence-based effective care to those who suffer a fragility fracture with a 
focus on the best outcomes for recovery, rehabilitation and secondary prevention 
of further fracture. The care community has to understand better the experience 
of fragility fracture from the perspective of the patient so that direct 
improvements in care can be based on the perspectives of the users. This book 
supports these needs by providing a comprehensive approach to nursing practice 
in fragility fracture care.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was successfully performed in 1968, and its 
use has grown significantly over the past five decades with the total number now 
exceeding 1 million patients. HSCT is a curative treatment for many 
haematological cancers and other disorders. Almost 40,000 HSCT procedures are 
performed Europe-wide per annum (Passweg et al., Bone Marrow Transplant, 2016), 
and with a 5-year survival around 50% (Friedrichs, Lancet Oncol 11(4):331–338, 
2010), the number of transplant recipients achieving ‘long-term survival’ and 
with late effects directly related to their treatment (Majhail et al., Hematol 
oncol Stem Cell Ther 5(1):1–30, 2012) is increasing. This growth in survivors is 
the result of improvements in transplant knowledge and expertise, refinements to 
conditioning regimes, developments in supportive care and increased numbers of 
procedures due to broadening transplant indications. The most common cause of 
death after transplant is relapsed disease. Yet, even without disease relapse, 
long-term survival is complex for many as other causes of mortality such as 
graft versus host disease (GvHD), infection, second malignancy, respiratory 
disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Savani et al., 2011) prove difficult 
to address. Recovery post-HSCT is challenging, lasting several months to years. 
These individuals are susceptible to the development of post-treatment physical 
and psychological sequelae years to decades after completion of treatment 
leading to a reduced life expectancy with greater morbidity when compared to an 
age-adjusted population (Socié et al., N Engl J Med 341:14–21, 1999). Survivors 
with late effects experience significantly poorer physical and mental health, 
report more unmet needs for care and have significantly greater use of health 
services compared with survivors without late effects (Treanor et al., 
Psychooncology 22(11):2428–2435, 2013). Furthermore, as the number of survivors 
continues to grow, their long-term health problems and subsequent needs demand 
increasing attention. The unpredictable, complex and multifactorial nature of 
these long-term and late effects in HSCT survivors means that patients require 
regular life-long assessment guided by rigorous protocols. However, it is 
important to remember that even using standardised protocols, these should be 
different for adults and children and the resulting care must be tailored to the 
needs of the individual survivor. And finally, further consideration is needed 
for the growing number of young people and adult survivors in long-term 
follow-up who have been treated in childhood and transitioned into adult 
long-term follow-up care.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity contributes substantively to disease burden, 
especially in highly car dependent countries such as New Zealand (NZ). We aimed 
to quantify the future health gain, health-sector cost-savings, and change in 
greenhouse gas emissions that could be achieved by switching short vehicle trips 
to walking and cycling in New Zealand.
METHODS: We used unit-level survey data to estimate changes in physical 
activity, distance travelled by mode, and air pollution for: (a) switching car 
trips under 1km to walking and (b) switching car trips under 5km to a mix of 
walking and cycling. We modelled uptake levels of 25%, 50%, and 100%, and 
assumed changes in transport behaviour were permanent. We then used multi-state 
life table modelling to quantify health impacts as quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained and changes in health system costs over the rest of the life 
course of the NZ population alive in 2011 (n = 4.4 million), with 3% 
discounting.
FINDINGS: The modelled scenarios resulted in health gains between 1.61 (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 1.35 to 1.89) and 25.43 (UI 20.20 to 30.58) QALYs/1000 
people, with total QALYs up to 112,020 (UI 88,969 to 134,725) over the remaining 
lifespan. Healthcare cost savings ranged between NZ$127million (UI $101m to 
157m) and NZ$2.1billion (UI $1.6b to 2.6b). Greenhouse gas emissions were 
reduced by up to 194kgCO2e/year, though changes in emissions were not 
significant under the walking scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial health gains and healthcare cost savings could be 
achieved by switching short car trips to walking and cycling. Implementing 
infrastructural improvements and interventions to encourage walking and cycling 
is likely to be a cost-effective way to improve population health, and may also 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) are essential in the treatment of 
psychotic disorders, but are well-known for inducing substantial weight gain and 
obesity. Critically, weight gain may reduce life expectancy for up to 20-30 
years in patients with psychotic disorders, and prognostic biomarkers are 
generally lacking. Even though other receptors are also implicated, the dorsal 
striatum, rich in dopamine D2 receptors, which are antagonized by antipsychotic 
medications, plays a key role in the human reward system and in appetite 
regulation, suggesting that altered dopamine activity in the striatal reward 
circuitry may be responsible for increased food craving and weight gain. Here, 
we measured striatal volume and striatal resting-state functional connectivity 
at baseline, and weight gain over the course of 12 weeks of antipsychotic 
treatment in 81 patients with early-phase psychosis. We also included a sample 
of 58 healthy controls. Weight measurements were completed at baseline, and then 
weekly for 4 weeks, and every 2 weeks until week 12. We used linear mixed models 
to compute individual weight gain trajectories. Striatal volume and whole-brain 
striatal connectivity were then calculated for each subject, and used to assess 
the relationship between striatal structure and function and individual weight 
gain in multiple regression models. Patients had similar baseline weights and 
body mass indices (BMI) compared with healthy controls. There was no evidence 
that prior drug exposure or duration of untreated psychosis correlated with 
baseline BMI. Higher left putamen volume and lower sensory motor connectivity 
correlated with the magnitude of weight gain in patients, and these effects 
multiplied when the structure-function interaction was considered in an 
additional exploratory analysis. In conclusion, these results provide evidence 
for a correlation of striatal structure and function with antipsychotic-induced 
weight gain. Lower striatal connectivity was associated with more weight gain, 
and this relationship was stronger for higher compared with lower left putamen 
volumes.

Objective: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause for recurrent stroke, has 
severe impact on a patient's health and imposes a high economic burden for 
society. Current guidelines recommend 24 h ECG monitoring (standard-of-care, 
SoC) to detect AF after stroke to reduce the risk of future events. However, 
paroxysmal AF (PAF) is difficult to detect within this period as it occurs 
infrequently and unpredictably. In a randomized controlled trial 
(Find-AFRANDOMISED), prolonged and enhanced Holter ECG monitoring (EPM) revealed 
a significantly higher detection rate of AF compared to SoC, although its 
cost-effectiveness has not yet been investigated. Methods: Based on the data of 
FIND-AFRANDOMISED, an economic evaluation was conducted. One group received EPM 
for 10 days after the event, and at 3 and 6 months; the other group received 
SoC. Healthcare resource use and quality of life (QoL) data were measured at 
baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) between both groups were compared. Non-parametric bootstrapping 
and one-way-sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: A total of 281 
patients with healthcare resource use and QoL data for all measurement points 
were considered in the economic evaluation (complete case analysis, CCA). The 
CCA yielded nonsignificant 315€ lower mean costs and 0.0013 less QALYs for 
patients receiving EPM with no statistically significant differences in any cost 
categories. Sensitivity analyses revealed robust results. Bootstrapping the 
results indicated moderate probability of cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: EPM 
yielded reduced not significantly different costs without affecting QoL and may 
be a useful strategy to detect PAF in acute ischemic stroke patients in time.

Pott's puffy tumour (PPT) is a known complication of frontal sinusitis. It is 
defined as subperiosteal abscess formation due to osteomyelitis of the frontal 
bone presenting as a forehead swelling. It is a life-threatening condition that 
can lead to intracranial and intraorbital complications. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI 
and contrast CT scan are the best modalities to localise and define the 
collection, in addition to confirming disease extension. Once confirmed by 
imaging and depending on disease extension, management of PPT requires a 
multidisciplinary team approach and depends on the local provision of surgical 
care. Following surgical drainage of the abscess cavity, a prolonged course of 
antibiotics is required postoperatively to treat the underlying osteomyelitis.

The serious shortage of registered nurses (RNs) in Thailand has made the Thai 
government tentatively propose a policy to extend the working life of Ministry 
of Public Health nurses. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of those 
RNs who intend to extend their working life and analyzed the associations 
between general characteristics, quality of work life, and job characteristics 
of the RNs and their intention to work past retirement age. This cross-sectional 
study was conducted from October 2016 to April 2017. Self-administered 
questionnaires were distributed nationally to 3,629 RNs in the age group 55-59 
years and working for the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Thailand. The 
response rate was 85.0% (3,092 RNs). Due to the small number of male 
participants (n=74), males were excluded from the study. The analysis was 
limited to the 3,018 participants who returned the questionnaire and met the 
inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were 
used for data analysis. Of the 3,018 participants, the proportion of RNs 
intending to extend their working life from 60 to 65 years was 30.5%. In the 
Service Department, the factors significantly associated with intention to 
extend working life were perceived good or very good health status, no shift 
work, monthly income more than 50,000 THB (1,595 USD), and having moderate or 
good working resources (p<0.01). In the four Academic Departments, perceived 
good or very good health status, monthly income more than 50,000 THB, family 
members not against the working life extension, and moderate or good working 
resources were the factors affecting intention to extend working life (p<0.01). 
This study indicated that understanding the various factors related to the 
intention to extend working life among RNs could lead to the design of 
appropriate programs to encourage them to continue working after the current 
retirement age.

Pleural mesothelioma and carcinoma prostate as metachronous double malignancy is 
extremely rare co-occurrence. A 67-year-old male, diagnosed case of carcinoma 
prostate with bone metastasis, was treated with chemotherapy and hormone 
therapy. He responded well to chemotherapy and hormone therapy. He remained 
asymptomatic for two years with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values 
within normal limits. After two years of diagnosis of carcinoma prostate, he 
developed left lung pleural sarcomatoid mesothelioma as a second metachronous 
tumor. Malignant pleural mesothelioma as a metachronous second tumor in a case 
of carcinoma prostate is rarely reported in the literature. The long-life 
expectancy, old age, late effects of the treatment, genetic predisposition and 
lifestyle factors of patients with carcinoma prostate expose them to the 
possibility of developing second primary tumor.
