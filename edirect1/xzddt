associated with the abnormal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which 
are widely known to be toxic in various cellular environments, including NDD 
contexts. Thus, ways to prevent or slow mitochondrial dysfunction are needed for 
the treatment of these NDDs. In this review, we first detail how ROS are 
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and review the cellular mechanisms, 
such as the mitochondrial quality control (MQC) system, by which neurons defend 
against both abnormal production of ROS and the subsequent accumulation of 
damaged mitochondria. We next highlight previous studies that link mitochondrial 
dysfunction with PD and how dietary antioxidants might provide reinforcement of 
the MQC system. Finally, we discuss how aging plays a role in mitochondrial 
dysfunction and PD before considering how healthy aging through proper diet and 
exercise may be salutary.

BACKGROUND: Global ischemia is the resulting effect of a cardiopulmonary arrest 
(CPA). Presently there is no effective treatment to address neurological 
deficits in patients who survived a CPA. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
is a growth factor (G-CSF) with a plethora of beneficial effects, including 
neuroprotection. Clinical application of human G-CSF (hG-CSF) is limited due to 
its plasma half-life of 4 h. Therefore, novel approaches need to be investigated 
that would (1) enable prolonged manifestation of hG-CSF and (2) demonstrate 
G-CSF efficacy from studying the underlying protective mechanisms of hG-CSF. In 
our previous work, we used the self-complementary adeno-associated virus 
(stereotype2: scAAV2) as a vector to transfect the hG-CSF gene into the global 
ischemic brain of a mouse. As an extension of that work, we now seek to 
elucidate the protective mechanisms of hG-CSF gene therapy against endoplasmic 
reticulum induced stress, mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy in global 
ischemia.
METHOD: A single drop of either AAV-CMV-hG-CSF or AAV-CMV-GFP was dropped into 
the conjunctival sac of the Swiss Webster mouse's left eye, 30-60 min after 
bilateral common artery occlusion (BCAO). The efficacy of the expressed hG-CSF 
gene product was analyzed by monitoring the expression levels of endoplasmic 
reticulum stress (ER), mitochondrial dynamics and autophagic proteins over 4- 
and 7-days post-BCAO in vulnerable brain regions including the striatum, 
overlying cortex (frontal brain regions) and the hippocampus (middle brain 
regions). Statistical analysis was performed using mostly One-Way Analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), except for behavioral analysis, which used Repeated Measures 
Two-Way ANOVA, post hoc analysis was performed using the Tukey test.
RESULTS: Several biomarkers that facilitated cellular death, including CHOP and 
GRP78 (ER stress) DRP1 (mitochondrial dynamics) and Beclin 1, p62 and LC3-ll 
(autophagy) were significantly downregulated by hG-CSF gene transfer. hG-CSF 
gene therapy also significantly upregulated antiapoptotic Bcl2 while 
downregulating pro-apoptotic Bax. The beneficial effects of hG-CSF gene therapy 
resulted in an overall improvement in functional behavior.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study has substantiated the approach of 
sustaining the protein expression of hG-CSF by eye drop administration of the 
hG-CSF gene. In addition, the study has validated the efficacy of using hG-CSF 
gene therapy against endoplasmic reticulum induced stress, mitochondrial 
dynamics and autophagy in global ischemia.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence supports hippocampal avoidance with whole brain 
radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) as the recommended treatment option in patients with good 
prognosis and multiple brain metastases as this results in better neurocognitive 
preservation compared to whole brain radiotherapy. However, there is often poor 
tumour control with this technique due to the low doses given. Stereotactic 
Radiosurgery (SRS), a form of focused radiotherapy which is given to patients 
who have a limited number of brain metastases, delivers a higher radiation dose 
to the metastases resulting in better target lesion control. With improvements 
in radiation technology, advanced dose-painting techniques now allow a 
simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose to lesions whilst minimising doses to 
the hippocampus to potentially improve brain tumour control and preserve 
cognitive outcomes. This technique is abbreviated to HA-SIB-WBRT or HA-WBRT+SIB.
METHODS: We hypothesise that the SIB in HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental arm) will 
result in better tumour control compared to HA-WBRT (control arm). This may also 
lead to better intracranial disease control as well as functional and survival 
outcomes. We aim to conduct a prospective randomised phase II trial in patients 
who have good performance status, multiple brain metastases (4-25 lesions) and a 
reasonable life expectancy (> 6 months). These patients will be stratified 
according to the number of brain metastases and randomised between the 2 arms. 
We aim for a recruitment of 100 patients from a single centre over a period of 
2 years. Our primary endpoint is target lesion control. These patients will be 
followed up over the following year and data on imaging, toxicity, quality of 
life, activities of daily living and cognitive measurements will be collected at 
set time points. The results will then be compared across the 2 arms and 
analysed.
DISCUSSION: Patients with brain metastases are living longer. Maintaining 
functional independence and intracranial disease control is thus increasingly 
important. Improving radiotherapy treatment techniques could provide better 
control and survival outcomes whilst maintaining quality of life, cognition and 
functional capacity. This trial will assess the benefits and possible toxicities 
of giving a SIB to HA-WBRT.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to cost and calculate the relative cost-effectiveness 
of the hypothetical suppression policies found in the Imperial College COVID-19 
Response Team model.
METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit 
bed days, and non-intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial 
College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the 
decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National 
income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a 
hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on 
projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources.
RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated 
pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under 
suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per 
QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus 
mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the 
Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national 
income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical 
Imperial model-projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective 
relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between 
government policy and Imperial model-projected suppression policy, it is hoped 
this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are 
involved.

OBJECTIVES: Given the limited diagnostic accuracy of radiographs on presentation 
to the emergency department (ED), the management of suspected scaphoid fractures 
remains clinically challenging and poses an unknown economic burden to 
healthcare systems. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immediate 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of patients presenting with 
suspected scaphoid fracture to an ED in England.
METHODS: A pragmatic, randomized, single-center trial compared the use of 
immediate MRI in the ED against standard care with radiographs only. 
Participants' use of healthcare services and costs were estimated from primary 
care and secondary care databases and questionnaires at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 
months postrecruitment. Costs were compared using generalized linear models and 
combined with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs, based on the EQ-5D-5L) to 
estimate cost-effectiveness at 6 months postrecruitment. Cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves and bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate the 
probability of cost-effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
thresholds. Four deterministic sensitivity scenarios were considered around key 
parameters.
RESULTS: The MRI intervention dominated standard care in the base case and all 4 
deterministic sensitivity scenarios, costing less and achieving more QALY gains, 
with a probability of 100% of being cost-effective at 6 months using the 
conventional United Kingdom WTP thresholds of £20 000 to £30 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The use of immediate MRI is a cost-effective intervention in the 
management of suspected scaphoid fractures in a Central Hospital in London. 
Routine clinical practice at our institution has been changed to include the 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the perioperative and morbidity outcomes after 
partial nephrectomy (PN) in patients with short life expectancy (SLE) (≥95% 
10-year expected mortality (10y-EM)), to assess the main predictors of outcomes 
in this population and to compare these results with those of a group at the 
opposite upper range with long LE (LLE, ≤5% 10y-EM) relying on a multicenter 
Italian prospective registry of kidney surgery (the RECORD 2 project).
METHODS: Clinical data of 4,325 patients undergone kidney surgery were collected 
at 26 urological Italian Centers from 2013 to 2016. SLE was defined as a ≥95% 
10y-EM (assessed using the age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]). A 
multivariable logistic regression for overall postoperative complications, acute 
kidney injury (AKI), positive surgical margins (SM) and ∆ estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25% at 2 years from surgery was performed in patients 
with SLE including clinically relevant variables. Adjusted outcomes reported as 
mean (SD) of the 2 groups were generated using separate multivariable logistic 
regression models and compared.
RESULTS: Overall, 559 patients with SLE were selected. Patients had an ASA score 
≥3 in 58.4% of cases. A clinical T1a, T1b, and T2 stage was found in 412 
(74.5%), 124 (22.4%), and 17 (3.1%) patients. The median PADUA score was 7 
(6-8). Surgical and medical postoperative complication rates were registered in 
14.8% and 6% cases. Postoperative AKI was reported in 27.3% cases, positive 
surgical margins (PSM) in 9.3% cases. In this subgroup of patients, ASA score, 
cerebrovascular disease, surgery in low volume centers, and open surgery were 
independent predictors of overall complications. ASA and PADUA scores, renal 
clamping, resection technique and lower eGFR at baseline were independent 
predictors of AKI. PADUA score, open approach and resection technique were 
independent predictors of PSM. Cardiovascular disease, hilar clamping, and 
resection technique were independent predictors of eGFR decrease >25% at 2 years 
from surgery. Patients with SLE were compared with those with LLE (n = 302). All 
analyzed parameters at baseline were significantly different among the groups 
with the exception of cancer laterality. After adjusting for several clinical 
variables, the SLE group had a significantly higher risk rate of adjusted 
overall postoperative complication rate compared to the LLE group (20.6% ± 0.36 
vs. 9.9% ± 0.65, P < 0.0001), while the overall intraoperative complications 
(4.1% ±0.13 vs. 2.3% ± 0.23), overall postoperative major complications (3.8% ± 
0.09 vs. 1.9% ± 0.14) adjusted AKI (24.2% ± 0.37 vs. 22.6% ± 0.92), positive 
surgical margins (8% ± 0.22 vs. 6.4% ± 0.49), and 2-year RF loss (13.4% ± 0.17 
vs. 12.4% ± 0.74).
CONCLUSION: In selected patients with SLE, PN is feasible with an acceptable 
safety profile that is overall comparable to patients with no LE limitations. 
While a robotic approach and surgery performed in high volume centers could 
reduce the risk of complications, an off-clamp approach and a SE surgical 
technique may decrease the risk of postoperative AKI and of longer term eGFR 
decrease.

The continued increase in global life expectancy predicts a rising prevalence of 
age-related cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVD), which requires a better 
understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In recent years, the 
concept of "inflammaging" has attracted increasing attention. It refers to the 
chronic sterile low-grade inflammation in elderly organisms and is involved in 
the development of a variety of age-related chronic diseases. Inflammaging is a 
long-term result of chronic physiological stimulation of the immune system, and 
various cellular and molecular mechanisms (e.g., cellular senescence, 
immunosenescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective autophagy, 
metaflammation, gut microbiota dysbiosis) are involved. With the deepening 
understanding of the etiological basis of age-related CSVD, inflammaging is 
considered to play an important role in its occurrence and development. One of 
the most critical pathophysiological mechanisms of CSVD is endothelium 
dysfunction and subsequent blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, which gives a clue 
in the identification of the disease by detecting circulating biological markers 
of BBB disruption. The regional analysis showed blood markers of vascular 
inflammation are often associated with deep perforating arteriopathy (DPA), 
while blood markers of systemic inflammation appear to be associated with 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Here, we discuss recent findings in the 
pathophysiology of inflammaging and their effects on the development of 
age-related CSVD. Furthermore, we speculate the inflammaging as a potential 
target for future therapeutic interventions to delay or prevent the progression 
of the age-related CSVD.

Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a life 
expectancy 15-20 years shorter than that in the general population. The rate of 
unnatural deaths, such as suicide and accidents, is high for these patients. 
Despite this increased proportion of unnatural deaths, physical conditions 
account for approximately 70% of deaths in patients with either schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorder, with cardiovascular disease contributing 17.4% and 22.0% to 
the reduction in overall life expectancy in men and women, respectively. Risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, unhealthy diet and lack of 
exercise, are common in these patients, and lifestyle interventions have been 
shown to have small effects. Pharmacological interventions to reduce risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease have been proven to be effective. Treatment 
with antipsychotic drugs is associated with reduced mortality but also with an 
increased risk of weight gain, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. These 
patients have higher risks of both myocardial infarction and stroke but a lower 
risk of undergoing interventional procedures compared with the general 
population. Data indicate a negative attitude from clinicians working outside 
the mental health fields towards patients with severe mental illness. Education 
might be a possible method to decrease the negative attitudes towards these 
patients, thereby improving their rates of diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing all over the world. To be able to 
support this positive development, health interventions focusing on promotion 
and prevention are crucial. Preventive home visits represent one example of a 
health intervention which addresses both promotion through a supportive dialogue 
and prevention by giving advice. However, to give support and advice that older 
persons experience as beneficial, there is a need for more research.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore older person's experiences of the 
benefits gained from the support and advice given during the preventive home 
visit.
METHOD: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 older 
persons, median age 77 years old, living at home, who had received a preventive 
home visit. The interviews were analysed with content analysis.
FINDINGS: The overarching theme Becoming empowered and recognised as a person 
was experienced as the major benefit of the support and advice given during the 
preventive home visit. The support and advice generated conditions for the 
person to become empowered, by contributing to a feeling of control and 
preparedness for the future. Furthermore, the support and advice given 
contributed to a feeling of becoming recognised as a person, as an outcome of 
the supportive dialogue and the assessment of their health, behaviour and their 
surrounding environment.
CONCLUSION: The support and advice given during the preventive home visit were 
experienced as person-centred, and conditions for becoming empowered were 
created. In order to create a positive outcome from the support and advice given 
during the preventive home visit, it seems important to focus on providing both 
a supportive dialogue and a structured assessment.

This paper investigated the long-term changes (from 1973 to 2013) of the 
seagrass meadows of Zostera marina, Zostera noltei and Cymodocea nodosa in the 
Adriatic Sea subjected to multiple pressures. We examined the changes of the 
meadows by means of field data collection, observations and analysis of aerial 
photography to identify the most important drivers of habitat loss. The major 
decline of seagrass extension observed from 1973 to 1989, was primarily driven 
by urban development, and by the increase of the blue tourism. From 1989 to 2007 
seagrass habitats progressively recovered due to the decrease of urbanization, 
but from 2007 to 2013 a further significant loss of seagrass meadows was 
apparently driven by thermal anomalies coupled with an increasing anthropogenic 
pressure. Our long-term analysis provides evidence that the rates of seagrass 
loss are faster than the recovery rates (i.e., -4.5 loss rate vs +2.5% recovery 
rate per year).

BACKGROUND: The FIRST-ABC trial comprises of two pragmatic, multicentre, 
parallel groups, non-inferiority randomised clinical trials designed to evaluate 
the clinical non-inferiority of first-line use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) 
to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in critically ill children who 
require non-invasive respiratory support (NRS).
OBJECTIVES: To describe the pre-specified statistical and health economic 
analysis for the FIRST-ABC trial before completion of patient recruitment and 
data collection.
METHODS: The statistical analysis plan was designed by the chief investigators 
and statisticians. We define the primary and secondary outcomes, summarise 
methods for data collection and safety monitoring, and present a detailed 
description of the planned statistical and health economic analysis.
RESULTS: The primary clinical outcome is time to liberation from respiratory 
support. The primary effect estimate will be the adjusted hazard ratio, reported 
with a 95% confidence interval. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis 
will be repeated using time to start weaning of NRS. Subgroup analyses will be 
performed to test for interactions between the effect of allocated treatment 
group and pre-specified baseline covariates. The health economic analysis will 
follow the intention-to-treat principle and report the mean (95% confidence 
interval) incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
cost-effectiveness up to 6 months. All analyses will be performed separately for 
each of the two trials, and any results will not be combined.
CONCLUSION: The FIRST-ABC trial will assess the non-inferiority of HFNC compared 
to CPAP in two parallel trials with shared infrastructure (step-up RCT and 
step-down RCT). We have developed a pre-specified statistical and health 
economics analysis plan for the FIRST-ABC study before trial completion to 
minimise analytical bias.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a significant modifiable risk factor for mortality for 
persons with serious mental illness (SMI), who have a life expectancy 
15-20 years shorter than the general population. Individuals with SMI and 
comorbid diabetes who are smokers face an even higher risk of cardiovascular 
complications and early death. Yet despite high rates of smoking among people 
with SMI, tobacco cessation interventions have not been broadly offered to this 
population.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health 
records from 2014 in a large integrated care delivery system to examine whether 
use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among smokers with type 2 diabetes 
varies by serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis. We analyzed smoking cessation 
medication prescription fills among adult smokers with diabetes, comparing those 
with SMI (N = 634) and without SMI (N = 18,021). Risk ratios were adjusted for 
age, gender, race, urban area type, and medical facility.
RESULTS: Of the SMI group, 19.09% filled at least one smoking cessation 
prescription compared to 9.73% of the non-SMI group (adjusted risk ratio 1.80 
[95% CI 1.52-2.13]; p < .001). For the SMI group, primary care providers wrote 
80.24% of prescriptions, while psychiatrists wrote 8.81% of prescriptions.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings offer an example of a delivery system with higher 
uptake of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy among people with SMI than without 
SMI, and highlight the opportunity to provide more smoking cessation 
interventions in mental health care settings.

The Class H scavenger receptors Stabilin-1 (Stab1) and Stabilin-2 (Stab2) are 
two of the most highly expressed genes in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells 
(LSECs). While Stab1-deficient (Stab1KO) and Stab2-deficient (Stab2KO) mice are 
phenotypically unremarkable, Stab1/2-double-deficient (StabDKO) mice exhibit 
perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, glomerulofibrotic nephropathy and a reduced life 
expectancy. These conditions are caused by insufficiently scavenged circulating 
noxious blood factors. The effects of either Stab-single- or double-deficiency 
on LSEC differentiation and function, however, have not yet been thoroughly 
investigated. Therefore, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of 
primary LSECs from Stab1KO, Stab2KO and StabDKO mice. Microarray analysis 
revealed dysregulation of pathways and genes involved in established LSEC 
functions while sinusoidal endothelial marker gene expression was grossly 
unchanged. 82 genes were significantly altered in Stab1KO, 96 genes in Stab2KO 
and 238 genes in StabDKO compared with controls; 42 genes were found to be 
commonly dysregulated in all three groups and all of these genes were 
downregulated. These commonly downregulated genes (CDGs) were categorized as 
"potential scavengers," "cell adhesion molecules," "TGF-β/BMP-signaling" or 
"collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) components". Among CDGs, Colec10, 
Lumican and Decorin, were the most strongly down-regulated genes and the 
corresponding proteins impact on the interaction of LSECs with chemokines, ECM 
components and carbohydrate structures. Similarly, "chemokine signaling," 
"cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" and "ECM-receptor interaction," were 
the GSEA categories which represented most of the downregulated genes in Stab1KO 
and Stab2KO LSECs. In summary, our data show that loss of a single Stabilin 
scavenger receptor - and to a greater extent of both receptors - profoundly 
alters the transcriptomic repertoire of LSECs. These alterations may affect 
LSEC-specific functions, especially interactions of LSECs with the ECM and 
during inflammation as well as clearance of the peripheral blood.

[Esophagectomy and Perioperative Management in Elderly Patients with Esophageal 
Cancer].

[Article in Japanese]

Watanabe M(1), Kozuki R.

Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.

According to the aging of society, elderly patients with esophageal cancer have 
been increasing in Japan. A multimodality treatment strategy is required to 
achieve long-term survival in patients with advanced-stage esophageal cancer. 
However, in elderly patients with impaired organ functions, the highly invasive 
treatment strategy is often difficult to be indicated. Esophagectomy remains the 
mainstay of treatment even in the elderly. Indication for esophagectomy in the 
elderly should be determined comprehensively, based on the physical status, life 
expectancy, tumor staging, and patients' desires. To predict the risk of 
postoperative complications, some scoring systems, such as estimation of 
physiology ability and surgical stress( E-PASS) and controlling nutritional 
status(CONUT), and the risk calculator provided by the National Clinical 
Database in Japan should be appropriately used. For patients with impaired organ 
functions, surgical procedures to reduce the surgical invasiveness, such as 
2-stage operation, transhiatal esophagectomy, and mediastinoscopic 
esophagectomy, should be considered as an alternative to conventional 
transthoracic esophagectomy and reconstruction. Depending on the situations, 
preservation of the bronchial artery, thoracic duct, and azygos arch should be 
considered. A care bundle by a multidisciplinary perioperative management team 
may decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality rates in elderly patients 
undergoing esophagectomy.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM) have mostly used state transition Markov models with time 
invariant transition probabilities (TIMMs). In three case studies of GBM 
treatments, we compared Partitioned Survival model (PSM) results with published 
outputs from TIMMs.
METHODS: PSMs used the same RCT data sources, utility values, time horizons, 
cycle times and annual discounting used in published TIMMs. Reported overall 
survival and progression-free survival plots were digitised and fitted with a 
range of parametric models. Economic model outputs were generated in the same 
form as reported for the TIMMs. PSM output uncertainty was explored in 
univariate and in multivariate sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: PSMs generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that were 
different to the published TIMMs. The magnitude of difference was substantial in 
two cases. The PSMs were reasonably robust and in sensitivity analyses were 
sensitive to variations in the same model inputs as were the TIMMs. When 
compared to the RCT data, the TIMMs tended to generate underestimates of the 
likely overall survival gain. TIMM estimates for depletion of individuals from 
the stable disease state and for accumulation in the dead state had relatively 
poor resemblance to the source RCT data.
CONCLUSION: TIMMs delivered different cost-effectiveness estimates to PSMs; in 
two cases, TIMMs produced substantially lower ICER values than PSMs. Model 
output differences appear attributable to less realistic cost-and-benefit 
estimates generated in TIMMs due to rapid depletion from the stable disease 
state and/or accumulation in the dead state.

Kidney palliative care is a growing subspecialty of clinical practice, 
education, and research in nephrology. It is an essential aspect of care for 
patients across the continuum of advanced kidney disease who have high symptom 
burden, multidimensional communication needs, and limited life expectancy. 
Training in kidney palliative care can occur in a variety of ways, from didactic 
curricula and clinical experiences embedded in nephrology fellowship training to 
the pursuit of additional dedicated fellowship training in palliative care. At 
this time, a minority of nephrologists pursue formal fellowship training in 
specialty palliative care. This article will discuss opportunities and 
challenges in building a skilled workforce that will address the palliative 
needs of patients living with advanced kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: Cervical mobilisations are used to treat people with neck pain but 
their mechanisms of action are unclear. One theorised reason for induced 
analgesia is effect on neck muscle activity.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of cervical mobilisations on muscle activity 
during active neck movements and whether changes in muscle activity are 
associated with changes in symptoms.
DESIGN: Double-blind randomised placebo controlled trial.
SETTING: Primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: 40 patients (aged 19 to 80 years, 24 female) with non-specific 
neck pain.
INTERVENTIONS: One session of cervical mobilisations or motionless manual 
contact (placebo).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: sternocleidomastoid (SCM), scalene (SCA), upper trapezius 
(UT) and erector spinae (ES) surface electromyography (SEMG) during active neck 
flexion, extension, side flexion and rotation was measured immediately before 
and after the intervention. Patients were classified as responders according to 
change in symptoms assessed using the Global Rating of Change Scale (GROC).
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, patients receiving mobilisation showed an 
increase in contralateral UT and ES SEMG during rotation and contralateral and 
ipsilateral SCM, SCA and UT during side flexion (P<0.05), however changes were 
mostly associated with an increase in range and speed of movement. The only 
association with GROC was increased (5%) SEMG in the contralateral SCM during 
side flexion in the mobilisation group (P=0.013).
CONCLUSION: Cervical mobilisations caused increased neck SEMG, mostly due to 
increased movement range and speed. Change in muscle activity is unlikely to be 
a major mechanism of action of cervical mobilisations in symptomatic improvement 
with physiological neck movements. (ClinicalTrials.gov record number: 2016/066).

[Expanding Pharmacy Services for Sustainable Universal Health Coverage: Lessons 
from the Canadian Health Care System].

Japan's health care system can be regarded as one of the best worldwide, 
provided it remains sustainable. It has relatively low costs, short wait times, 
low disease incidence, and high life expectancy. However, universal coverage in 
Japan faces financial challenges due to the country's rapidly aging population. 
Canada is another of the few developed countries that have universal health 
coverage. In contrast to Japan, Canada's health care spending is still 
sustainable according to recent studies. Effective cost control by payers has 
played a major role, with providers being steered toward evidence-based and 
cost-effective drug therapies. Furthermore, expanded pharmacy services have been 
important in suppressing spending on prescription drugs and minor health care 
services such as vaccination, government-funded smoking cessation, and 
medication review programs. This article outlines the services provided by 
Canadian pharmacists with expanded scope of practice. The pharmaceutical 
profession and its advocacy body in Canada have not only played a role in 
regulatory changes, but also put in place technological infrastructure called 
PharmaNet and contributed to appropriate prescribing. Given the current economic 
situation and demographic trends in Japan, more options should be explored in 
order to maintain universal health coverage by meeting the funding gap. 
Utilizing community pharmacies and pharmacists is proposed as one option.
