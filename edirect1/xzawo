and catheter angiography (CA) was found to be cost-effective at pre-test 
probabilities (PTP) below 30%.
CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of CCS as an alternative to sECG in investigating 
suspected stable angina in low PTP population (<30%) would be cost-effective. In 
patients with PTP of CAD >30%, proceeding to MPS or CA would be more 
cost-effective than performing either CCS or sECG.
KEY POINTS: Coronary calcium scoring (CCS) is useful for assessing coronary 
artery atherosclerosis It can be performed with multi-detector CT, which is now 
widely available It plays a role in excluding disease in suspected stable angina 
Our study assesses its role in this setting as alternative to stress-ECG 
Adoption of CCS as an alternative to sECG could prove cost-effective.

Self-care management is an important part of living with a chronic illness. 
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic disease with acute, painful exacerbations 
that often results in a shortened life expectancy. Some middle-aged and older 
adults with SCD lived with the disease prior to having a diagnosis and without 
modern advances. The purpose of this study is to share the self-care 
recommendations of middle-aged and older adults with SCD. Using descriptive 
qualitative methods, data were gathered through semistructured interviews from 
11 individuals living with SCD, including 6 women and 5 men. Self-care 
recommendations themes included physiological, psychological, and 
provider-related. The self-care recommendations may be seen as an additional 
resource or "words of wisdom" for younger adults with SCD who can use the 
recommendations to better manage their own disease. Additionally, providers may 
be able to use these recommendations to inform their practice.

BACKGROUND: During the last century we have seen wide-reaching changes in diet, 
nutritional status and life expectancy. The change in diet and physical activity 
patterns has become known as the nutrition transition. At any given time, a 
country or region within a country may be at different stages within this 
transition. This paper examines a range of nutrition-related indicators for 
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and attempts to develop a typical model of 
a country in transition.
METHODS: Based on the availability of data, 40 countries in SSA were selected 
for analysis. Data were obtained from the World Health Organisation, Demographic 
and Health Surveys and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United 
Nations. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) was used to explore the 
determinants of infant mortality. A six point score was developed to identify 
each country's stage in the nutrition transition.
RESULTS: MLRA showed that underweight-for-age, protein and the percentage of 
exclusively breastfed infants were associated with the infant mortality rate 
(IMR). The majority of countries (n = 26) used in the analysis had nutrition 
transition scores of zero and one. Most of them had a high prevalence of infant 
mortality, children that were stunted or underweight-for-age, small percentages 
of women that were overweight and obese, and low intakes of energy, protein, and 
fat. Countries with the highest scores include South Africa, Ghana, Gabon, Cape 
Verde and Senegal which had relatively low IMRs, high levels of 
obesity/overweight, and low levels of underweight in women, as well as high 
intakes of energy and fat. These countries display classic signs of a population 
well established in the nutrition-related non-communicable disease phase of the 
nutrition transition.
CONCLUSIONS: Countries in SSA are clearly undergoing a nutrition transition. 
More than half of them are still in the early stage, while a few have reached a 
point where changes in dietary patterns are affecting health outcomes in a large 
portion of the population. Those in the early stage of the transition are 
especially important, since primordial prevention can still be introduced.

BACKGROUND: Primary prevention measures are needed for Africa's cancer burden 
(715,000 new cases and 542,000 deaths in 2008), a burden projected to double by 
2030 due to demographic changes alone. Control of cancer-causing infections and 
lifestyle-related carcinogens will play a significant role in prevention, but 
less often addressed are environmental and occupational contributions.
METHODS: We review environmental issues that contribute to Africa's Cancer 
burden.
RESULTS: We demonstrate evidence of the impact of environmental carcinogens on 
the cancer burden as of now and that circumstances present today may increase 
their contribution further. Suboptimal implementation and monitoring of 
environmental protection and of occupational health standards, including in the 
informal sector, use of outdated technologies in industry and lack of awareness 
of potential hazards in the specific employment structure give rise to high 
levels of exposures. Carcinogens of concern include (i) those that have been 
long present (e.g. indoor air pollution) whose contribution may increase as 
life-expectancy increases and long latency periods for cancer are realised, (ii) 
exposures in mining and agricultural sectors and (iii) modern environmental 
hazards, including urban air pollution and agents arising from the 
mis-management of hazardous waste from local, industrial and trans-boundary 
sources.
CONCLUSIONS: Actions taken to reduce exposures and research to fill gaps in 
knowledge, adapted to local settings, could help mitigate the cancer burden.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence points to the theory of planned behavior as a 
useful framework to understand physical activity behavior in cancer patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to examine the demographic, medical, and 
social-cognitive correlates of physical activity in palliative cancer patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to advanced cancer patients 
aged 18 years or older with a clinician-estimated life expectancy of less than 
12 months and Palliative Performance Scale >30%, from outpatient palliative 
care, oncology clinics, and palliative home care.
RESULTS: Fifty participants were recruited. Correlates of total physical 
activity levels were affective attitude (r = 0.36, P = .011), self-efficacy (r = 
0.36, P = .010), and intention (r = 0.30, P = .034). Participants who reported 
60 minutes or more of total physical activity daily reported significantly 
higher affective attitude (M = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-1.6, P = 
.008) and self-efficacy (M = 0.8, 95% CI 0.0-1.5, P = .046). Participants <60 
years of age (M = 343, 95% CI -7 to 693, P = .054) and who were normal or 
underweight (M = 333, 95% CI -14 to 680, P = .059) reported higher weekly 
minutes of total physical activity.
LIMITATIONS: Our small sample may not be representative of the total palliative 
cancer population.
CONCLUSIONS: Affective attitude, self-efficacy, and intention were the strongest 
correlates of total physical activity levels, and younger and normal/underweight 
participants did more physical activity.

Somatic LMCD1 mutations promoted cell migration and tumor metastasis in 
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Common genetic alteration in cancer genomes is implicated for embracing an 
aberrant cancer gene participated in tumor progression. In this study, we 
identified a somatic mutated LIM and cysteine-rich domains-1 (LMCD1) as a 
putative metastatic oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using 
integrated genomic approaches. In addition to revealing genomic amplification 
and gene upregulation, we identified recurrent E135K (3/48 cases) mutations in 
HCC tissues and K237R mutation in the PLC/PRF/5 HCC cell line. Expression of 
mutant LMCD1 E135K or K237R reduced the stress fiber assembly, increased 
cortical actin accumulation and induced lamellipodial extension. Consistently, 
these mutations enhanced cell migration and showed activation of the 
Rac1-signaling pathway. Inhibition of the LMCD1/Rac1 pathway by an LMCD1 
short-hairpin RNA (shLMCD1) or the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed the 
mutation-mediated lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration. In PLC/PRF/5 
cells with endogenous K237R mutation, cell migration was enhanced by 
estrogen-induced LMCD1 expression but reversed by shLMCD1 treatment. Moreover, 
overexpression of LMCD1 E135K mutation significantly promoted systemic lung 
metastasis in a murine tail vein injection model. Together, our results suggest 
that LMCD1 mutations are potential oncogenic events in HCC metastasis to promote 
cell migration through the Rac1-signaling pathway.

[Surgical treatment of elderly patients with cancer].

[Article in Japanese]

Japan.

Surgical intervention for elderly cancer patients should be carefully considered 
after weighing the risks of post-operative mortality, morbidity, functional 
deterioration due to the surgery, and speculated life expectancy. The decision 
to perform surgery should be made only after considering the merits and demerits 
of the surgery compared with other treatment options, and the patients' own 
opinions based on sufficient understanding of his/her disease. Pre-operative 
risk assessment is indispensable and should be used to evaluate not only 
chronological age but also various functional aspects, clinical findings, and 
social and economic backgrounds. In the literature, several assessment systems 
have been introduced. However, none of them successfully covered various modes 
of surgical procedures that have been adopted for a wide variety of cancer 
diseases and stages. Some of them are not practical because they are extremely 
time-consuming. Generally, the surgical option is indicated in patients with 
longer life expectancy, an earlier cancer stage, and lower speculated risk, to 
realize the cure of the disease. Fundamentally, surgical intervention is aimed 
at a prolongation of life span with minimum disruption to activities of daily 
living. From this point of view, conservative options, such as radiation or drug 
therapy are sometimes preferred over surgery even in cases of earlier stage of 
cancer. On the other hand, surgical intervention may be appropriate for patients 
with advanced disease for avoiding urgent life-threatening symptoms or serious 
functional disorders that annoys patients' daily life.

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of hemiarthroplasty compared to internal 
fixation for elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures. Over 2 
years, patients treated with hemiarthroplasty gained more quality-adjusted life 
years than patients treated with internal fixation. In addition, costs for 
hemiarthroplasty were lower. Hemiarthroplasty was thus cost effective.
INTRODUCTION: Estimating the cost utility of hemiarthroplasty compared to 
internal fixation in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in the 
elderly.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted alongside a clinical 
randomized controlled trial at a university hospital in Norway; 166 patients, 
124 (75%) women with a mean age of 82 years were randomized to either internal 
fixation (n = 86) or hemiarthroplasty (n = 80). Patients were followed up at 4, 
12, and 24 months. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D, 
and in combination with time used to calculate patients' quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Resource use was identified, quantified, and valued for direct 
and indirect hospital costs and for societal costs. Results were expressed in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Over the 2-year period, patients treated with hemiarthroplasty gained 
0.15-0.20 more QALYs than patients treated with internal fixation. For the 
hemiarthroplasty group, the direct hospital costs, total hospital costs, and 
total costs were non-significantly less costly compared with the internal 
fixation group, with an incremental cost of €2,731 (p = 0.81), €2,474 
(p = 0.80), and €14,160 (p = 0.07), respectively. Thus, hemiarthroplasty was the 
dominant treatment. Sensitivity analyses by bootstrapping supported these 
findings.
CONCLUSION: Hemiarthroplasty was a cost-effective treatment. Trial registration, 
NCT00464230.

Life-expectancy increased in patients infected with HIV/AIDS with the advent of 
highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). Facial lipoatrophy is a common 
complication in these patients, eventually leading to stigma, segregation and a 
negative impact in quality of life (QOL). We measured the impact of the 
treatment of facial lipoatrophy with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in the QOL 
of patients with HIV/AIDS by using four questionnaires that address QOL. Forty 
consecutive patients on ART referred for facial lipoatrophy treatment were 
enrolled in this study. The first 20 were allocated to the intervention group 
and were treated with tissue augmentation with PMMA. The other 20 were allocated 
to the control group, which received treatment only after six months. At 
baseline, four questionnaires were applied to all patients in both groups and 
again after six months. The variation in scores within the control group for all 
domains of all four instruments was significantly better when compared with that 
within the control group. We detected improvement in the QOL of patients with 
HIV/AIDS and facial lipoatrophy when they were treated with PMMA.

Which is more cost-effective under the MELD system: primary liver 
transplantation, or salvage transplantation after hepatic resection or after 
loco-regional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria?

Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The optimal strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a 
disease with increasing incidence, in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis 
has long been debated. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of hepatic 
resection (HR) or locoregional therapy (LRT) followed by salvage orthotopic 
liver transplantation (SOLT) vs. that of primary orthotopic liver 
transplantation (POLT) for HCC within the Milan Criteria.
METHODS: A Markov-based decision analytic model simulated outcomes, expressed in 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for the three treatment 
strategies. Baseline parameters were determined from a literature review. 
Sensitivity analyses tested model strength and parameter variability.
RESULTS: Both HR and LRT followed by SOLT were associated with earlier 
recurrence, decreased survival, increased costs and decreased quality of life 
(QoL), whereas POLT resulted in decreased recurrence, increased survival, 
decreased costs and increased QoL. Specifically, HR/SOLT yielded 3.1 QALYs (at 
US$96 000/QALY) and LRT/SOLT yielded 3.9 QALYs (at US$74 000/QALY), whereas POLT 
yielded 5.5 QALYs (at US$52 000/QALY). Sensitivity analyses supported these 
findings at clinically meaningful probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS:  Under the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) system, in 
patients with HCC within the Milan Criteria, POLT increases survival and QoL at 
decreased costs compared with HR or LRT followed by SOLT. Therefore, POLT is the 
most cost-effective strategy for the treatment of HCC.

Cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy for prevention.

Recent empirical studies and analyses have heightened interest in the use of 
expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) for prevention of HIV transmission. 
However, ART is expensive, approximately $600 per person per year, raising 
issues of the cost and cost-effectiveness of ambitious ART expansion. The goal 
of this review is to equip the reader with the conceptual tools and substantive 
background needed to understand and evaluate the policy and programmatic 
implications of cost-effectiveness assessments of ART for prevention. We provide 
this review in six sections. We start by introducing and explaining basic 
concepts of health economics as they relate to this issue, including resources, 
costs, health metrics (such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years), and different 
types of economic analysis. We then review research on the cost and 
cost-effectiveness of ART as treatment, and on the cost-effectiveness of 
traditional HIV prevention. We describe critical issues in the epidemic impact 
of ART, such as suppression of transmission and the role of the acute phase of 
infection. We then present a conceptual model for conducting and interpreting 
cost-effectiveness analyses of ART as prevention, and review the existing 
preliminary estimates in this area. We end with a discussion of future 
directions for programmatic demonstrations and evaluation.

Concomitant radiochemotherapy become the treatment of choice for locally 
advanced SCHNC. This strategy of treatment has a limitation, which is an acute 
and late toxicity. The IMRT technique provides the possibility of better sparing 
of healthy tissue. Radiobiological and clinical data also suggest that 
accelerated fractionation and higher dose per fraction given in GTV may produce 
better locoregional control. Therefore it might be expected that concomitant 
chemotherapy and SIB-IMRT radiotherapy could increase locoregional control and 
reduce acute and late radiation reactions. The evaluation of early results and 
toxicity of this treatment modality is presented.
AIM OF STUDY: The evaluation of the early results and toxicity of SIB-IMRT 
radiotherapy given concomitantly with cisplatin for locally advanced squamous 
cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC).
METHODS: SIB-IMRT technique was applied. The boost volume was limited to the GTV 
+ 3mm margin (macroscopic tumor extension was defined on the basis of CT and/or 
MRI examinations). Dose per fraction given to this volume was 2.25 Gy up to 67.5 
Gy of total dose. The PTV-CTV + 3mm - was defined as an area of increased risk 
of microscopic spread. Dose per fraction given to this volume was 2 Gy up to 60 
Gy. The PTV1-ETV+ 3mm (electively irradiated volume) received dose per fraction 
-1.8 Gy up to 54-56 Gy. Overall treatment time was 6 weeks (5 fractions per 
week, 30 fractions). Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin in daily 
dose100mg/m2 given two times during irradiation (1 and 22 day of treatment). The 
evaluation of early tolerance was performed once weekly during the treatment 
than during the follow up every 2 months. The early reactions were scored 
according to the EORTC/RTOG scale.
MATERIAL: Between June 2006 and December 2009 99 patients diagnosed with III and 
IV clinical stage of SCHNC were treated with this method. 65 patients were 
diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer, 18 with laryngeal cancer and 16 with 
hypopharyngeal cancer. PEG was performed at 65 patients before treatment for 
better alimentation during radiochemotherapy.
RESULTS: No severe life risking complications were observed a no concequentional 
late effects were observed. Extended mucositis grade III according RTOG/EORTC 
scale were observed only in boost region in 80% patients just after treatment 
was completed. In 2 patients ulceration were observed in tumour side which have 
healed up spontaneously within two months after treatment. 55% patients were 
suffering for III xerostomia and 41% for middle after the treatment. Majority of 
side effects were cured within 4 months after irradiation. The PEG was removing 
in 92% patients 2 months after treatment. The median follow-up time is 28 months 
(ranged from 14 m to 58 m). Actuarial 2-years overall survival and disease-free 
survival is respectively 90% and 82%, probability of locoregional recurrence at 
2-years is 14% and 5-years estimated is 17,5%.
CONCLUSIONS: At the present moment it might be concluded that accelerated 
radiotherapy with SIB-IMRT given concomitantly with cisplatin produce excellent 
local control in patients treated of III-IV stage SCHNC without increasing 
toxicity.

School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: It is known that the prognostic value of cardiovascular risk factors 
differed between men and women, but data in the elderly are very limited.
METHODS: We assessed cardiovascular structural and functional measurements 
(intima-media thickness, pulse pressure, pulse wave velocity, left atrial 
dimension (LAD), arrhythmia, deceleration time of transmitral early diastolic 
flow and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)), by ultrasonography, blood 
pressure monitor, electrocardiography and applanation tonometry, as well as 
conventional cardiovascular risk factors (age, body mass index, smoke, total to 
high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, and plasma glucose), and 
investigated their associations with all-cause mortality in men and women, 
separately, in 331 consecutive patients (87±7years, 74.0% female) with a history 
of cardiovascular disease from the geriatric departments. After a mean follow-up 
of 378days, 110 deaths were recorded.
RESULTS: In the full adjusted models, we found that increased LAD (hazard ratio 
[HR]=2.24 per 1-standard deviation [SD]; 95% confidential interval [CI]: 
1.23-4.09), reduced LVEF (HR=0.60 per 1-SD; 95% CI: 0.38-0.96), and increased 
total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (HR=1.99 per 1-SD; 95% CI: 1.05-3.78) were 
significant predictors of all-cause mortality in men, whereas the presence of 
arrhythmia (HR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.28-4.78), increased plasma glucose (HR=1.32 per 
1-SD; 95% CI: 1.06-1.64) and decreased body mass index (HR=0.60 per 1-SD; 95% 
CI: 0.44-0.83) could significantly predict all-cause mortality in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Even in the last stage of lifespan, risk factors for all-cause 
death still differ significantly in men and women with cardiovascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of magnesium 
neuroprophylaxis for all women at risk for preterm birth <32 weeks.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic and cost-effectiveness model was designed to 
compare use of magnesium for neuroprophylaxis vs no treatment for women at risk 
for preterm birth <32 weeks due to preterm premature rupture of membranes or 
preterm labor from 24-32 weeks. Outcomes included neonatal death and 
moderate-severe cerebral palsy. Effectiveness was reported in quality-adjusted 
life years.
RESULTS: Magnesium for neuroprophylaxis led to lower costs ($1739 vs $1917) and 
better outcomes (56.684 vs 56.678 quality-adjusted life years). However, 
sensitivity analysis revealed the model to be sensitive to estimates of effect 
of magnesium on risk of moderate or severe cerebral palsy as well as neonatal 
death.
CONCLUSION: Based on currently published evidence for efficacy, magnesium for 
neuroprophylaxis in women at risk to deliver preterm is cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Previous reports on the prevalence of autosomal recessive congenital 
ichthyosis (ARCI) were based on single source data, such as lists of members in 
a patient association. These sources are likely to be incomplete.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the prevalence of ARCI.
METHODS: We obtained data from 3 incomplete sources (dermatology departments, a 
genetic testing laboratory, and the Spanish ichthyosis association) and combined 
them using the capture-recapture method.
RESULTS: We identified 144 living patients with ARCI. Of these, 62.5% had 
classic lamellar ichthyosis and 30.6% had congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. 
The age distribution included fewer elderly patients than expected. The 
prevalence of ARCI in patients younger than 10 years, the best estimate as less 
subject to bias, was 16.2 cases per million inhabitants (95% confidence interval 
13.3-23.0). According to the capture-recapture model, 71% of the patients were 
not being followed up in reference units, 92% did not have a genetic diagnosis, 
and 78% were not members of the ichthyosis association.
LIMITATIONS: The prevalence of ARCI in Spain and findings related to the Spanish 
health care system might not be generalizable to other countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ARCI is higher than previously reported. Many 
patients are not being followed up in reference units, do not have a genetic 
diagnosis, and are not members of a patient association, indicating room for 
improvement in their care. Data suggesting a reduced number of older patients 
might imply a shorter life expectancy and this requires further study.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Improving the surgical outcome of nonambulatory patients 
with metastatic epidural spinal compression has been of great interest lately. 
Although there have been many reports regarding the surgical outcome of spinal 
metastasis, the surgical outcome in terms of the probability of operative 
success for nonambulatory patients has not been thoroughly described. If the 
probability of ambulatory recovery is known, the optimal surgical indications 
can be determined and implemented.
PURPOSE: To predict the surgical outcome and probability of ambulatory 
resumption for nonambulatory patients with spinal metastasis.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The surgical outcomes of patients who could not ambulate 
independently because of spinal metastasis from 1987 to 2010 were analyzed.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was postoperative ambulatory status. The 
secondary end point was survival time.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients who could not ambulate independently at the time 
of surgery were included in the study. We defined "independent ambulation" as a 
better functional status than Nurick Grade 3, which is defined as "difficulty in 
walking which was not so severe as to require someone's help to walk." 
Preoperatively, functional status was Nurick Grade 4 in 21 patients and Grade 5 
in 36 patients. Weakness developed 10.5 ± 11.9 days (median, 7.0; range, 1-80) 
before the operation and steadily worsened. Patients were unable to walk 
starting from 3.6 ± 4.9 days (median, 1.8; range, 0.5-23) before the operation. 
The spinal metastases were circumferentially decompressed.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, 39 patients (68%) could walk. Complications occurred 
in 26% (15/57) of the patients, and the major complication rate was 12% (7/57). 
The mortality rate was 5% (3/57). The patient survival time was 287 ± 51 days 
(median, 128) after the operation. Postoperative ambulatory status (yes vs. no, 
p < .01) and occurrence of major complication (yes vs. no, p < .01) affected 
survival time. Overall, patients could walk for 193±41 days (median, 114) 
postoperatively. Motor grade (grade ≥ 4/5 vs. <4/5, p < .01) and the occurrence 
of a major complication (yes vs. no, p < .01) were significant factors for 
resumption of ambulation. The rate of ambulation resumption was 95% (20/21) in 
patients with a motor grade of 4 of 5, whereas it was 53% (19/36) in patients 
with a motor grade less than 4 of 5 (p < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: The survival time of nonambulatory patients was dependent on 
ambulation recovery. About 95% of the nonambulatory patients could walk after 
surgery, when the operation was done in a timely manner with good remaining 
motor function. However, given the short life expectancy and the considerable 
surgical complication rate, surgery should only be prudently recommended to 
patients with optimal indications.

Antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phenolic activities in extra 
virgin olive oil.

Australia. sara.cicerale@deakin.edu.au

The Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower incidence of chronic 
degenerative diseases and higher life expectancy. These health benefits have 
been partially attributed to the dietary consumption of extra virgin olive oil 
(EVOO) by Mediterranean populations, and more specifically the phenolic 
compounds naturally present in EVOO. Studies involving humans and animals (in 
vivo and in vitro) have demonstrated that olive oil phenolic compounds have 
potentially beneficial biological effects resulting from their antimicrobial, 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This paper summarizes current 
knowledge on the biological activities of specific olive oil phenolic compounds 
together with information on their concentration in EVOO, bioavailability and 
stability over time.

AIM: The objective of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
saxagliptin (Onglyza(®)), a DPP-4 inhibitor, plus metformin compared with a 
sulphonylurea (SU) (Glipizide) plus metformin in Swedish patients not well 
controlled on metformin alone.
METHODS: Data from a 52-week clinical trial comparing saxagliptin and glipizide 
in combination with metformin was used in a simulation model to estimate long 
term complications in a cohort of type 2 diabetes patients. The model estimates 
the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications, 
diabetes-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and ultimately, costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the investigated treatment 
strategies. Costs and QALYs were estimated for a lifetime time horizon.
RESULTS: Compared with SU+metformin, the cost per QALY gained with 
saxagliptin+metformin is approximately SEK 91,000. Patients on 
saxagliptin+metformin gain 0.10 QALYs on average, at an incremental cost of 
around SEK 9500. The cost-effectiveness results were robust to various 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, over a patient's lifetime, the 
addition of saxagliptin to metformin is associated with improvements in 
quality-adjusted life years compared with SU in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Saxagliptin treatment is a cost-effective treatment alternative for type 2 
diabetes in patients not well-controlled on metformin alone.

Comparing EQ-5D scores for comorbid health conditions estimated using 5 
different methods.

Ara R(1), Brazier J.

Author information:

Sheffield, UK. r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: There is currently no consensus on the most appropriate method to 
estimate health state utility values (HSUVs) for comorbid health conditions.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the accuracy by applying 5 
different methods to an EQ-5D dataset.
METHODS: EQ-5D data (n=41,174) from the Health Survey for England were used to 
compare HSUVs generated using the additive, multiplicative and minimum methods, 
the adjusted decrement estimator, and a linear regression.
RESULTS: The additive and multiplicative methods underestimated the majority of 
HSUVs and the magnitude of the errors increased as the actual HSUV increased. 
Conversely, the minimum and adjusted decrement estimator methods overestimated 
the majority of HSUVs and the magnitude of errors increased as the actual HSUV 
decreased. Although the simple linear model produced the most accurate results, 
there was a tendency to underpredict higher HSUVs and overpredict lower HSUVs. 
The magnitude and direction of mean errors could be driven by the actual scores 
being estimated in addition to the technique used and the HSUVs estimated using 
an adjusted baseline were generally more accurate.
CONCLUSIONS: The additive and minimum methods performed very poorly in our data. 
Although the simple linear model gave the most accurate results, the model 
requires validating in external data obtained from the EQ-5D and other 
preference-based measures. Based on the current evidence base, we would 
recommend the multiplicative method is used together with a range of univariate 
sensitivity analyses.

The Force of Selection on the Human Life Cycle.

Jones JH(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Anthropology, Stanford, CA, USA.

In this paper, I present evidence for a robust and quite general force of 
selection on the human life cycle. The force of selection acts in remarkably 
invariant ways on human life histories, despite a great abundance of demographic 
diversity. Human life histories are highly structured, with mortality and 
fertility changing substantially through the life cycle. This structure 
necessitates the use of structured population models to understand human life 
history evolution. Using such structured models, I find that the vital rates to 
which fitness is most sensitive are pre-reproductive survival probabilities, 
particularly the survival of children ages 0-4. The fact that the preponderance 
of selection falls on transitions related to recruitment combined with the late 
age at first reproduction characteristic of the human life cycle, creates a 
fitness bottleneck out of recruitment. Because of this, antagonistic pleiotropy 
with any trait that detracts from the constituent transitions to recruitment is 
expected. I explore the predictors of variation in the force of selection on 
early survival. High fertility increases the selective premium placed on early 
survivorship, while high life expectancy at birth decreases it.

Localised prostate cancer - current treatment options.

Duchesne G(1).

Author information:
(1)Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, University of Melbourne and Monash University, 
Melbourne, Victoria. gillian.duchesne@petermac.org

BACKGROUND: A number of options are available to treat localised prostate 
cancer, with different side effect profiles, effect on quality of life and 
social costs.
OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the grading and staging of localised prostate 
cancer and explores the role of each of the treatment options currently 
available.
DISCUSSION: Treatment selection in localised prostate cancer depends on life 
expectancy and comorbidities, risk adapted assessment and patient preference. 
Risk assessment depends on the grade, stage and prostate specific antigen. 
Options for treatment of localised prostate cancer include active surveillance, 
radical prostatectomy, curative external beam radiation therapy and 
brachytherapy. Androgen deprivation therapy in combination with radiation 
therapy has been shown to increase survival in men with high and 
high/intermediate risk of occult metastases. Survival rates are essentially 
equivalent for each modality and are over 90% at 10 years and over 75% at 15 
years.

Prescribed medicines for elderly frail people with diabetes resident in nursing 
homes-issues of polypharmacy and medication costs.

Gadsby R(1), Galloway M, Barker P, Sinclair A.

Author information:
(1)Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, NHS Coventry, UK.

AIMS: To describe the numbers and costs of medications prescribed to people 
living with diabetes resident in nursing homes in one primary care trust in the 
UK.
METHODS: A retrospective case notes review of 75 people with known diabetes who 
were resident in the 11 nursing homes in the Coventry teaching primary care 
trust.
RESULTS: Sixty-three residents (84%) were being prescribed four or more 
medications. Forty-four residents (59%) were prescribed anti-platelet drugs for 
prevention of cardiovascular disease, including aspirin, clopidogrel and 
dipyridamole, and 31 residents (41%) were on statin therapy. Eighteen (24%) 
residents had a monthly medication cost that was above £101 per month. On 
detailed review, these were largely residents who were being prescribed special 
order liquid preparations, usually for secondary cardiovascular disease 
prevention.
CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy, defined as taking four or more drugs per day per 
resident, is highly prevalent within this population of care home residents with 
diabetes. A high proportion of residents are prescribed drugs for cardiovascular 
disease prevention, which may be entirely inappropriate in this population with 
limited life expectancy. Regular medication review of care home residents with 
diabetes should be undertaken as it has the potential to reduce costs, minimize 
adverse drug reactions and increase health gain.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of tanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody 
that inhibits nerve growth factor, for the treatment of moderate to severe 
osteoarthritis in Japanese patients.
DESIGN: Patients received tanezumab 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 μg/kg, or placebo and 
were followed for 92 or 120 days. Endpoints included the incidence of adverse 
events (AEs) and the change from baseline to week 8 in pain intensity and the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) subscales.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 83) were 69% female, age 44-73 years, with a 
Kellgren-Lawrence X-ray grade of 2-4. At week 8, compared with placebo, 
tanezumab 25, 100, and 200 μg/kg improved index knee pain during walking 
(-18.5, -14.3, and -27.6, respectively), index knee pain in the past 24 h 
(-19.1, -14.6, and -24.2, respectively), current index knee pain (-16.5, -10.9, 
and -22.8, respectively), and the WOMAC pain (-11.5, -9.6, and -18.8, 
respectively), physical function (-8.7, -9.5, and -17.6, respectively), and 
stiffness (-20.4, -11.2, and -10.2, respectively) subscales. Overall, seven 
patients reported AEs of abnormal peripheral sensation: allodynia (two in the 
tanezumab 200 μg/kg group); paresthesia (two in the tanezumab 200 μg/kg group), 
dysesthesia (one in the tanezumab 200 μg/kg group); thermohypoesthesia (one in 
the tanezumab 100 μg/kg group), and decreased vibratory sense (one in the 
placebo group). All of these AEs were mild to moderate in severity and transient 
in nature.
CONCLUSIONS: Tanezumab was safe and generally well tolerated and may improve 
pain symptoms in Japanese patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the 
knee. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00669409.

OBJECTIVES: Previous research has suggested people with impaired fasting glucose 
(IFG) are less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) if they receive 
prolonged structured diet and exercise advice. This study examined the 
within-trial cost-effectiveness of such lifestyle interventions.
METHODS: Screen-detected participants with either newly diagnosed T2DM or IFG 
were randomized 2:1 to intervention versus control (usual care) between February 
and December 2009, in Norfolk (UK). The intervention consisted of group based 
education, physiotherapy and peer support sessions, plus telephone contacts from 
T2DM volunteers. We monitored healthcare resource use, intervention costs, and 
quality of life (EQ-5D). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gain (incremental cost effectiveness ratio [ICER]), and cost 
effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) were estimated.
RESULTS: In total, 177 participants were recruited (118 intervention, 59 
controls), with a mean follow-up of 7 months. Excluding screening and 
recruitment costs, the mean cost was estimated to be £551 per participant in the 
intervention arm, compared with £325 in the control arm. The QALY gains were 
-0.001 and -0.004, respectively. The intervention was estimated to have an ICER 
of £67,184 per QALY (16 percent probability of being cost-effective at the 
£20,000/QALY threshold). Cost-effectiveness estimates were more favorable for 
IFG participants and those with longer follow-up (≥ 4 months) (ICERs of £20,620 
and £17,075 per QALY, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Group sessions to prevent T2DM were not estimated to be within 
current limits of cost-effectiveness. However, there was a large degree of
