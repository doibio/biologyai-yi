Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) has a predilection for the deep soft tissues of 
the extremities and mainly occurs in children. Although the tumor may originate 
in other sites, such as the nasal cavity or paranasal sinus, invasion of the 
orbit is unusual. We describe the clinicopathological features of 2 cases of 
alveolar RMS of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinus in adult patients with 
orbital extension. These cases of alveolar RMS of the nasal cavity or paranasal 
sinuses are described in 2 men, both in the third decade of life. These patients 
were evaluated with radiological studies. The histological diagnosis was 
confirmed by immunohistochemical methods. Treatment consisted in a combination 
of chemotherapy and radiation therapy following excisional biopsy. Alveolar 
subtype RMS is an extremely aggressive neoplasm that rarely presents in the 
orbit or paranasal sinuses of adults but should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of tumors with this localization. Myoglobin, Myo D1, and 
myogenin seem to be the most specific markers for RMS.

Supernaturalizing Social Life : Religion and the Evolution of Human Cooperation.

Rossano MJ(1).

Hammond, LA, 70402, USA. mrossano@selu.edu.

This paper examines three ancient traits of religion whose origins likely date 
back to the Upper Paleolithic: ancestor worship, shamanism, and the belief in 
natural and animal spirits. Evidence for the emergence of these traits coincides 
with evidence for a dramatic advance in human social cooperation. It is argued 
that these traits played a role in the evolution of human cooperation through 
the mechanism of social scrutiny. Social scrutiny is an effective means of 
reducing individualism and enhancing prosocial behavior. Religion's most ancient 
traits represent an extension of the human social world into the supernatural, 
thus reinforcing within-group cooperation by means of ever-vigilant spiritual 
monitors. Believing that the spirits were always watching may have helped reduce 
the number of non-cooperators within a group while reinforcing group behavioral 
norms, thus allowing humanlike levels of cooperation to emerge.

IMPORTANCE: Active surveillance (AS), per the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) guidelines, is considered for patients with low-risk prostate 
cancer (PC) and a life expectancy of at least 10 years. However, given the grade 
migration following the 2005 International Society of Urologic Pathology 
consensus conference, AS may be appropriate for men presenting with favorable 
intermediate-risk PC.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare the risk of PC-specific mortality (PCSM) and 
all-cause mortality (ACM) following brachytherapy among men with low and 
favorable intermediate-risk PC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study of 5580 
consecutively treated men (median age, 68 years) with localized adenocarcinoma 
of the prostate treated with brachytherapy at the Prostate Cancer Foundation of 
Chicago between October 16, 1997, and May 28, 2013.
INTERVENTION: Standard of practice per the NCCN guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fine and Gray competing risks regression and Cox 
regression analyses were used to assess whether the risks of PCSM and ACM, 
respectively, were increased in men with favorable intermediate-risk vs low-risk 
PC. Analyses were adjusted for age at brachytherapy, year of treatment, and 
known PC prognostic factors.
RESULTS: After median follow-up of 7.69 years, 605 men had died (10.84% of total 
cohort), 34 of PC (5.62% of total deaths). Men with favorable intermediate-risk 
PC did not have significantly increased risk of PCSM and ACM compared with men 
with low-risk PC (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% CI, 0.76-3.53; P = .21 
for PCSM; adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.88-1.39; P = .38 for ACM). Eight-year 
adjusted point estimates for PCSM were low: 0.48% (95% CI, 0.23%-0.93%) and 
0.33% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.56%) for men with favorable intermediate-risk PC and 
low-risk PC, respectively. The respective estimates for ACM were 10.45% (95% CI, 
8.91%-12.12%) and 8.68% (95% CI, 7.80%-9.61%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Men with low-risk PC and favorable intermediate-risk 
PC have similarly low estimates of PCSM and ACM during the first decade 
following brachytherapy. While awaiting the results of ProtecT, the randomized 
trial of AS vs treatment, our results provide evidence to support AS as an 
initial approach for men with favorable intermediate-risk PC.

IMPORTANCE: The past 2 decades have witnessed progress in the management of 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with more effective agents and better 
surgical, medical, and supportive care. While substantial progress has been 
made, much more must be achieved to prolong the lives of patients.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review to ascertain what percentage of the 
life expectancy gain in locally advanced and mCRC over the past 2 decades is due 
to novel therapies vs improvements in supportive care or secular trends and to 
thus inform treatment development strategies.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, 
Embase, CancerLit, and Healthstar electronic databases for trials covering the 
period 1993 to 2015, scanned reference lists of articles, and searched recent 
conference abstracts. Ninety-six phase 3 trials and large (>50 patients) phase 2 
trials in mCRC were examined. Outcomes evaluated in the experimental arms (EAs) 
and control arms (CAs) included overall response rate, stable disease, 
progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
FINDINGS: Over the period covered by the studies, the OS in EAs increased at a 
mean (95% CI) rate of 0.80 (0.67-0.93) mo/y. Importantly, OS in the CAs improved 
0.63 (0.51-0.75) mo/y, reflecting in part the use of experimental regimens in 
subsequent studies. Chemotherapy contributed only partly to the gains in OS, 
given that (1) mean (95% CI) improvements in PFS were only 0.31 (0.22-0.39) mo/y 
in the EAs and 0.23 (0.15-0.31) mo/y in CAs; (2) gains in survival not directly 
attributable to the protocol were greater than gains in PFS (0.46 [0.36-0.57] 
mo/y in EAs and 0.39 [0.29-0.49] mo/y in CAs; and (3) effects on OS were much 
lower in second-line trials (median [interquartile range] response rates, 8.6% 
[0%-11.0%] in EAs and 7.5% [3.8%-12.8%] in CAs) compared with first-line trials 
(39.5% [24.0%-50.2%] for EAs and 29.4% [16.4%-39.4%] for CAs).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The OS of patients with mCRC has improved gradually 
over the past 2 decades, with gains from chemotherapy occurring alongside gains 
from lead-time bias and improved locoregional approaches and supportive care. 
Gains from first-line therapies have been modest but consistent; however, gains 
from second-line therapies have been disappointing. We believe that future 
progress will be greater if emphasis is placed on enrolling patients in 
experimental trials to explore and develop alternative first-line regimens and 
better second-line therapies.

IMPORTANCE: Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Current 
estimates of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to 
inform local cancer control strategies.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), 
years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 
cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2013 study was used. Cancer registries were the source for cancer incidence data 
as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data 
include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other 
sources. The MI ratios were used to transform incidence data to mortality 
estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. Cancer prevalence 
was estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were 
calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which 
were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying 
the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life 
expectancy; and DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
FINDINGS: In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million 
deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for 
cancer incidence (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 
million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for 
cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was 
the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million). For women, breast cancer was the 
leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) 
per 100 000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100 000 for both sexes 
in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer 
(ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), 
esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; 
ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and 
nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1.5 vs 0.4; ASDR, 1.2 vs 0.3). Between 1990 and 
2013, ASIRs for all cancers combined (except nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi 
sarcoma) increased by more than 10% in 113 countries and decreased by more than 
10% in 12 of 188 countries.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cancer poses a major threat to public health 
worldwide, and incidence rates have increased in most countries since 1990. The 
trend is a particular threat to developing nations with health systems that are 
ill-equipped to deal with complex and expensive cancer treatments. The annual 
update on the Global Burden of Cancer will provide all stakeholders with timely 
estimates to guide policy efforts in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, 
and palliation.

Availability of hydroxyurea (HU) coupled with early therapeutic interventions 
has increased the life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease. Hence, 
the sickle cell community needs to be aware of common diseases of aging that 
survivors are predisposed to. We chose to investigate the sickle cell 
disease-related complications as well as non sickle cell disease-related medical 
problems of aging in 45 sickle cell patients over the age of 40 years. The most 
frequent chronic complications of sickle cell disease were elevated tricuspid 
regurgitant jet velocity on echocardiogram, chronic renal disease, iron overload 
and leg ulcers. Medical co-morbidities in this patient group included 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypercholesterolemia and symptomatic 
coronary artery disease (CAD). In our cohort, only 38.0% had a primary care 
doctor. Only 11.0% over age 50 had a screening colonoscopy, and of the women, 
42.0% had a screening mammography. Medical co-morbidities and lack of health 
maintenance in older sickle cell patients are likely to impact overall health 
and mortality. Aging patients with sickle cell disease may benefit from a 
primary medical home for age appropriate comprehensive health care.

Patients who develop hydronephrosis due to an acute cause often have colic-like 
pain but hydronephrosis secondary to a chronic cause is often asymptomatic. 
Ureteral obstruction can be due to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic causes, 
such as trauma, radiation, iatrogenic injury, urolithiasis, malignancies and 
congenital causes. Management planning is dictated by the underlying cause, 
patient comorbidity and life expectancy. Malignant ureteral obstructions can be 
managed with segmental metal stents with advantages in the quality of life and 
provide an alternative to long-term treatment with a DJ stent. Endoscopic 
balloon dilatation and endoureterotomy are options for benign ureteral 
strictures up to 2 cm in length. For longer benign strictures there are a number 
of reconstructive techniques, which can also be performed by laparoscopic or 
robot-assisted approaches at specialized centers.

Ocean acidification is predicted to impact ecosystems reliant on calcifying 
organisms, potentially reducing the socioeconomic benefits these habitats 
provide. Here we investigate the acclimation potential of stony corals living 
along a pH gradient caused by a Mediterranean CO2 vent that serves as a natural 
long-term experimental setting. We show that in response to reduced skeletal 
mineralization at lower pH, corals increase their skeletal macroporosity 
(features >10 μm) in order to maintain constant linear extension rate, an 
important criterion for reproductive output. At the nanoscale, the coral 
skeleton's structural features are not altered. However, higher skeletal 
porosity, and reduced bulk density and stiffness may contribute to reduce 
population density and increase damage susceptibility under low pH conditions. 
Based on these observations, the almost universally employed measure of coral 
biomineralization, the rate of linear extension, might not be a reliable metric 
for assessing coral health and resilience in a warming and acidifying ocean.

BACKGROUND: The thoracolumbar junction is the transition from a stiff (thoracic 
spine) to a mobile zone (lumbar spine) and is relatively unstable compared with 
the thoracic and lumbar portions of the spine. The need for anterior 
reconstruction after a corpectomy has been emphasized by several authors. 
However, for patients with a relatively short life expectancy, anterior 
reconstruction may be unnecessary. Posterior instrumentation alone may be 
sufficient to provide pain relief and stability for such patients. The goal of 
this study was to assess the postoperative outcomes and survival rates of 
patients with tumor metastases of the lower thoracic spine and thoracolumbar 
junction (T10-L1) who underwent transpedicular partial corpectomy without 
anterior vertebral reconstruction.
METHODS: From November 2001 to February 2015, 29 patients diagnosed with 
symptomatic spinal cord compression caused by tumor metastasis involving T10 to 
L1 underwent palliative surgery that involved a posterolateral transpedicular 
partial corpectomy without anterior reconstruction. The surgical indication was 
neurologic progression. A follow-up was conducted for all of the patients, 
including reviewing medical records and performing an examination in the 
outpatient department.
RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 33 to 83 years (mean, 61.6 years). 
Neurologic improvement by at least one Frankel grade was noted in 75.9 % of the 
patients (N = 22). Neither intraoperative mortality nor implant failure was 
reported. The median survival rate was 7.43 months (range, 0.47-28 months).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the stability of implants can 
be maintained up to 28 months with satisfying functional outcome after a 
palliative posterolateral transpedicular partial corpectomy without anterior 
reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: We sought to evaluate life expectancy and mortality of HIV-positive 
individuals initiating combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) across Canada, 
and to consider the potential error introduced by participant loss to follow-up 
(LTFU).
METHODS: Our study used data from the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) 
collaboration, including HIV-positive individuals aged ≥18 years who initiated 
ART on or after January 1, 2000. The CANOC collaboration collates data from 
eight sites in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. We computed abridged 
life-tables and remaining life expectancies at age 20 and compared outcomes by 
calendar period and patient characteristics at treatment initiation. To correct 
for potential underreporting of mortality due to participant LTFU, we 
conservatively estimated 30% mortality among participants lost to follow-up.
RESULTS: 9997 individuals contributed 49,589 person-years and 830 deaths for a 
crude mortality rate of 16.7 [standard error (SE) 0.6] per 1000 person-years. 
When assigning death to 30% of participants lost to follow-up, we estimated 1170 
deaths and a mortality rate of 23.6 [SE 0.7] per 1000 person-years. The crude 
overall life expectancy at age 20 was 45.2 [SE 0.7] and 37.5 [SE 0.6] years 
after adjusting for LTFU. In the LTFU-adjusted analysis, lower life expectancy 
at age 20 was observed for women compared to men (32.4 [SE 1.1] vs. 39.2 [SE 
0.7] years), for participants with injection drug use (IDU) history compared to 
those without IDU history (23.9 [SE 1.0] vs. 52.3 [SE 0.8] years), for 
participants reporting Aboriginal ancestry compared to those with no Aboriginal 
ancestry (17.7 [SE 1.5] vs. 51.2 [SE 1.0] years), and for participants with CD4 
count <350 cells/μL compared to CD4 count ≥350 cells/μL at treatment initiation 
(36.3 [SE 0.7] vs. 43.5 [SE 1.3] years). Life expectancy at age 20 in the 
calendar period 2000-2003 was lower than in periods 2004-2007 and 2008-2012 in 
the LTFU-adjusted analyses (30.8 [SE 0.9] vs. 38.6 [SE 1.0] and 54.2 [SE 1.4]).
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy and mortality for HIV-positive individuals 
receiving ART differ by calendar period and patient characteristics at treatment 
initiation. Failure to consider LTFU may result in underestimation of mortality 
rates and overestimation of life expectancy.

The lifetime utility of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. The aim of this study was 
to ascertain when LT is cost-effective for HCC patients, with a view to 
proposing new transplant selection criteria. The study involved a real cohort of 
potentially transplantable Italian HCC patients (n = 2419 selected from the 
Italian Liver Cancer group database) who received nontransplant therapies. A 
non-LT survival analysis was conducted, the direct costs of therapies were 
calculated, and a Markov model was used to compute the cost utility of LT over 
non-LT therapies in Italian and US cost scenarios. Post-LT survival was 
calculated using the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) model on the basis of AFP values 
and radiological size and number of nodules. The primary endpoint was the net 
health benefit (NHB), defined as LT survival benefit in quality-adjusted life 
years minus incremental costs (US $)/willingness to pay. The calculated median 
cost of non-LT therapies per patient was US $53,042 in Italy and US $62,827 in 
the United States. On Monte Carlo simulation, the NHB of LT was always positive 
for AFP model values ≤ 3 and always negative for values > 7 in both countries. A 
multivariate model showed that nontumor variables (patient's age, 
Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class, and alternative therapies) had the potential to 
shift the AFP model threshold of LT cost-ineffectiveness from 3 to 7. LT proved 
always cost-effective for HCC patients with AFP model values ≤ 3, whereas the 
cost-ineffectiveness threshold ranged between 3 and 7 using nontumor variables.

Melanoma in situ (MIS) poses special challenges with regard to histopathology, 
treatment, and clinical management. The negligible mortality and normal life 
expectancy associated with patients with MIS should guide treatment for this 
tumor. Similarly, the approach to treatment should take into account the 
potential for MIS to transform into invasive melanoma, which has a significant 
impact on morbidity and mortality. Part II of this continuing medical education 
article reviews the histologic features, treatment, and management of MIS.

BACKGROUND: This study attempted to measure the environmental burden of disease 
by examining mortality and disability rates in South Korea, permitting 
international comparisons.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) was used to analyze data from 
public records. Years of life lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD) were 
measured in terms of incidence rate and number of deaths. Attributable risks 
were based on those for WHO Western Pacific Regions. For air pollution, 
attributable risk was calculated using local PM10 levels and relative risk.
RESULTS: The total Korean environmental burden of disease was 17.98 per 1000 
persons and the most serious risk factor was air pollution, at 6.89 per 1000 
persons. Occupation was the second highest contributing factor, at 3.29 per 1000 
persons, followed by indoor air pollution at 2.91 per 1000 persons. The DALY of 
air-pollution (indoor and outdoor) was 9.80 per 1000 persons, accounting for 
more than half of the total environmental burden of disease. The burden of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and asthma were 4.07, 3.16, 
and 1.96 per 1000 persons, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory illnesses comprised most of the disease burden, the 
majority of which was linked to air pollution. The present results are important 
as they could be used to make evidence-based decisions regarding the management 
of diseases and environmental-risk factors.

Malignant meningiomas are a rare but aggressive subset of intracranial 
meningiomas leading to a very limited life expectancy. The occurrence of spinal 
metastases in these tumors is an even rarer event. The described patient had an 
intracranial malignant meningioma and developed a symptomatic osteolytic 
contrast-enhancing lesion in the left C-1 lateral mass suspicious for 
metastasis. The authors performed a minimally invasive posterior resection of 
the lesion with vertebroplasty of C-1. Histopathology verified metastasis of the 
malignant meningioma. The surgical procedure resulted in prompt and permanent 
pain reduction until the patient died 18 months later. Given the very limited 
life expectancy in this case, the authors did not consider occipitocervical 
fusion because of their desire to preserve the range of motion of the head. 
Therefore, they suggest minimally invasive tumor resection and vertebroplasty in 
selected palliative tumor patients.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate HIV prevalence, the number of people living with 
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and the undiagnosed proportion in the Netherlands for 2012, and 
to compare these with published 2007 estimates.
DESIGN: Synthesis of all available data sources.
METHODS: Multi-Parameter Evidence Synthesis (MPES) was used to obtain estimates 
in mutually exclusive key populations at higher risk in three geographical 
regions (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, rest of the Netherlands). Data sources included 
HIV prevalence surveys, diagnoses at STI clinics, and registered cases in HIV 
care. Group specific estimates were reported as Bayesian posterior medians and 
95% credible intervals (CrI).
RESULTS: The 2012 model estimated 24,350 PLWHA (95% CrI 20,420-31,280) aged 
15-70 years; 2,906 (+14%) more than in 2007. The estimated population HIV 
prevalence was 0.20% (95% CrI 0.17-0.26%). The overall proportion of undiagnosed 
HIV was lower in 2012 (34%, 95% CrI 22-49%) compared to 2007 (40%, 95% CrI 
25-55%). After MSM, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean formed 
the largest groups of PLWHA, but proportions of undiagnosed HIV remained high in 
these groups, 48% and 44% respectively. Amsterdam had lowest proportions 
undiagnosed for most key populations at higher risk, including MSM and migrants.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2012, the number of PLWHA was higher compared to 2007, while the 
proportion of undiagnosed HIV was lower, especially among MSM. Higher HIV 
testing rates, earlier treatment, and an improved life expectancy may explain 
these differences. HIV interventions need to be expanded in all key populations 
at higher risk, with special focus on migrants and key populationsliving outside 
of Amsterdam.
