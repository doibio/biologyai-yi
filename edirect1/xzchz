health-related quality of life, resource use and costs, side effects of 
treatment and adverse events. Higher scores on all measures indicate poorer 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Between July 2013 and October 2015 we randomised 276 participants, of 
whom 195 (70.6%) were followed up 52 weeks later. At 52 weeks, 49 (36%) of those 
participants prescribed lamotrigine and 58 (42%) of those prescribed placebo 
were taking it. At 52 weeks, the mean total ZAN-BPD score was 11.3 [standard 
deviation (SD) 6.6] among those participants randomised to lamotrigine and 11.5 
(SD 7.7) among those participants randomised to placebo (adjusted mean 
difference 0.1, 95% CI -1.8 to 2.0; p = 0.91). No statistically significant 
differences in secondary outcomes were seen at any time. Adjusted costs of 
direct care for those prescribed lamotrigine were similar to those prescribed 
placebo.
LIMITATIONS: Levels of adherence in this pragmatic trial were low, but greater 
adherence was not associated with better mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of lamotrigine to the usual care of people with BPD 
was not found to be clinically effective or provide a cost-effective use of 
resources.
FUTURE WORK: Future research into the treatment of BPD should focus on improving 
the evidence base for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
non-pharmacological treatments to help policy-makers make better decisions about 
investing in specialist treatment services.

AIMS: The recent LIRA-SWITCH trial showed that switching from sitagliptin 100 mg 
to liraglutide 1.8 mg led to statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and body mass index (BMI). Based on 
these findings, the aim of the present study was to assess the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide in patients with 
type 2 diabetes in the UK.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model Version 8.5+ was used to 
project costs and clinical outcomes over patients' lifetimes. Baseline cohort 
characteristics and treatment effects were derived from the LIRA-SWITCH trial. 
Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. Costs were 
accounted in pounds sterling (GBP) and expressed in 2016 values. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Model projections showed improved quality-adjusted life expectancy for 
patients with poorly controlled HbA1c upon switching from sitagliptin to 
liraglutide, compared with continuing sitagliptin treatment (9.18 vs 9.02 
quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Treatment switching was associated with 
increased overall costs (GBP 24737 vs GBP 22362). Higher pharmacy costs were 
partially offset by reduced diabetes-related complication costs in patients who 
switched to liraglutide. Switching to liraglutide was associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 15423 per QALY gained vs continuing 
with sitagliptin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Switching from sitagliptin 100 mg to liraglutide 1.8 mg in patients 
with poor glycaemic control was projected to improve clinical outcomes and is 
likely to be considered cost-effective in the UK setting and, therefore, a good 
use of limited NHS resources.

Cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are rising exponentially due to increasing 
global life expectancy. There are approximately 50 million sufferers worldwide, 
with prevalence rising most rapidly in low-income countries such as Africa and 
Asia. There is currently no definite diagnosis of AD until after death, thus an 
early biomarker for AD is urgently required in order to administer timelier and 
more effective interventions. Olfactory dysfunction (problems with the sense of 
smell) is one of the earliest, preclinical symptoms observed in AD. Olfaction is 
a promising early biomarker for use worldwide as it is easy, cheap to measure, 
and not reliant on specialist clinicians or laboratory analysis. We carried out 
a meta-analysis to determine the credibility of olfaction in diagnosing AD in 
the preclinical stages, by comparing olfaction in healthy controls against AD 
patients and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data from 10 
articles were subjected to two comparative meta-analyses. In the case of AD, the 
results illustrated that the overall magnitude of effect size was more apparent, 
d = -1.63, 95% CI [-1.95, -1.31], in comparison to that of MCI, d = -0.81, 95% 
CI [-1.08, -0.55]. This shows that olfaction worsens progressively as patients 
progress from MCI to AD, highlighting the potential for olfactory dysfunction to 
identify AD in the preclinical stages prior to MCI.

Household fuel combustion, especially using solid combustibles (biomass and 
fossil fuels), for cooking and other activities produces emissions that 
contribute to concentrations of indoor as well as outdoor air pollutants such as 
particulate matter with diameter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) that deteriorate 
health and likely affect life expectancy (LEX). This study investigates the 
impact of PM2.5 from household combustion on LEX considering several covariates 
while controlling for ambient PM2.5 generated by other sectors. The generalized 
method of moments (GMM) model and the panel cointegration model were applied to 
a dataset of 43 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries over the time period of 
1995-2010. Both approaches provide similar results indicating that household 
PM2.5 is significantly and negatively associated with higher aggregate LEX in 
the long-run, and, to a greater degree for female's. Also, among the control 
variables, PM2.5 from the transport sector has a greater influence on male's 
LEX. Thus, efforts should be combined to reduce household PM2.5 since lower 
levels are associated with increased LEX.

Recent studies have uncovered various molecules that play key roles in neuronal 
morphogenesis. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the neuron-type-dependent 
regulation of morphogenesis remain unknown. We have previously reported that 
inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) markedly reduced axonal length 
of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) in a neuron-type-dependent manner. In the 
present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which the growth of CGN axons 
was severely suppressed upon GSK3 inhibition. Using time-lapse imaging of 
cultured CGNs at early morphogenesis, we found that extension of the leading 
process was severely inhibited by the pharmacological inhibition of GSK3. The 
rate of somal migration was also reduced with a GSK3 inhibitor in dissociated 
culture as well as in microexplant culture. In addition, CGNs ectopically 
expressed with a catalytically inactive mutant of GSK3 exhibited a migration 
defect in vivo. In axonal leading processes of CGNs, detyrosination and 
acetylation of α-tubulin, which are known to correlate with microtubule 
stability, were decreased by GSK3 inhibition. A photoconversion analysis found 
that inhibition of GSK3 increases the turnover of microtubules. Furthermore, in 
the presence of paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing reagent, inhibition of 
GSK3 recovered the axonal leading process extension that was reduced by 
paclitaxel. Our results suggest that GSK3 supports the extension of axonal 
processes by stabilizing microtubules, contrary to its function in other 
neuron-types, lending mechanical insight into neuron-type-dependent 
morphological regulation.

BACKGROUND: Ixekizumab has demonstrated improvement in patients with 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis by selectively targeting interleukin-17A, which is 
a proinflammatory cytokine that is important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
OBJECTIVE: To report 4-year efficacy and safety results from the open-label 
extension (OLE) of this phase 2 trial.
METHODS: Analysis was by last observation carried forward. Patients received 
ixekizumab, 120 mg, and then 80 mg subcutaneously once every 4 weeks.
RESULTS: Of the patients who completed the randomized placebo-controlled trial, 
93% entered the OLE. A 75% reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score 
was reported in 82% of patients at week 208 of the OLE. A static Physician's 
Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 was reported in 64% of patients, and a score 
of 0 was reported in 45% at week 208. Patients' Dermatology Life Quality Index 
and Itch Visual Analog Scale scores decreased when compared with baseline. 
Improvements were observed in other efficacy and health outcome measures. 
Serious adverse events were observed in 16.7% of patients, and 87% had 1 or more 
treatment-emergent adverse events. Three patients had serious infections. One 
patient reported 2 major cardiovascular events.
LIMITATIONS: The study was unblinded and lacked a placebo or active comparator.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy was shown to be maintained for up to 4 years of ixekizumab 
treatment.

Paternal involvement in children's lives is associated with a variety of child 
outcomes, including improved cognition, improved mental health, reduced obesity 
rates, and asthma exacerbation. Given this evidence, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics has promoted actions by pediatricians to engage fathers in pediatric 
care. Despite these recommendations, the mother-child dyad, rather than the 
mother-father-child triad, remains a frequent focus of care. Furthermore, 
pediatric care is often leveraged to improve maternal health, such as screening 
for maternal depression, but paternal health is infrequently addressed even as 
men tend to exhibit riskier behaviors, poorer primary care utilization, and 
lower life expectancy. Therefore, increasing efforts by pediatric clinicians to 
engage fathers may affect the health of both father and child. These efforts to 
engage fathers are informed by currently used definitions and measures of father 
involvement, which are discussed here. Factors described in the literature that 
affect father involvement are also summarized, including culture and context; 
interpersonal factors; logistics; knowledge and self-efficacy; and attitudes, 
beliefs, and incentives. Innovative ways to reach fathers both in the clinic and 
in other settings are currently under investigation, including use of behavior 
change models, motivational interviewing, mobile technologies, peer support 
groups, and policy advocacy efforts. These modalities show promise in 
effectively engaging fathers and improving family health.

The Intersection of Curandismo and Western Medicine and Their Epidemiological 
Impact for Aging Mexican Americans.

United States. Electronic address: paquiroz@Central.UH.EDU.

The rising costs of health care in the United States continue to stimulate 
interest in alternative health care options among Americans. Western medicine is 
also beginning to pay more attention to these alternative practices and their 
utility for successful treatment of illness. Alternative health care practices 
have always been used by Hispanics whose mortality and morbidity profiles have 
stimulated interest from researchers. Though Hispanics occupy some of the lowest 
socioeconomic positions in the United States, they have higher life expectancy 
rates and comparable rates of morbidity for many health conditions relative to 
other racial/ethnic groups. This has been referred to as the "Hispanic health 
advantage" and the "Hispanic health paradox" [Turra CM, Elo IT. The impact of 
salmon bias on hispanic mortality advantage: new evidence from social security 
data. Popul Res Policy Rev. 2008;27:515. Franzini L, Fernandez-Esquer ME.

income Mexican-origin individuals in Texas. Soc Sci Med. 2004;59(8):1629-1646.

characteristics protect health outcomes. J Pers. 2009;77(6):1707-1746. Turra CM, 
Goldman N. Socioeconomic differences in mortality among U.S. adults: insights 
into the Hispanic paradox. J Gerontol. 2007;62(3):184-192]. Even when 
controlling for socioeconomic status and education, life expectancy for 
Hispanics is greater than that of whites (CDIC, 2015). Debate about the causes 
of this paradox continues and some data indicates that the paradox is specific 
to older Hispanics (i.e., middle and older ages). Among Hispanic ethnic groups, 
this "paradox" has been most salient for Mexican Americans, therefore, this 
chapter focuses on Mexican Americans and the intersections of traditional health 
care practices among Mexican Americans (curandismo) with the practice of Western 
medicine to explore how they combine and conflict to impact aging Hispanics in 
three health areas: diabetes, menopause, and dementia.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nonoperative management, primary 
SLAP repair, and primary biceps tenodesis for the treatment of symptomatic 
isolated type II SLAP tear.
METHODS: A microsimulation Markov model was constructed to compare 3 strategies 
for middle-aged patients with symptomatic type II SLAP tears: SLAP repair, 
biceps tenodesis, or nonoperative management. A failed 6-month trial of 
nonoperative treatment was assumed. The principal outcome measure was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2017 U.S. dollars using a societal 
perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Treatment effectiveness was expressed 
in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Model results were compared with 
estimates from the published literature and were subjected to sensitivity 
analyses to evaluate robustness.
RESULTS: Primary biceps tenodesis compared with SLAP repair conferred an 
increased effectiveness of 0.06 QALY with cost savings of $1,766. Compared with 
nonoperative treatment, both biceps tenodesis and SLAP repair were 
cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values of $3,344/QALY 
gained and $4,289/QALY gained, respectively). Sensitivity analysis showed that 
biceps tenodesis was the preferred strategy in most simulations (52%); however, 
for SLAP repair to become cost-effective over biceps tenodesis, its probability 
of failure would have to be lower than 2.7% or the cost of biceps tenodesis 
would have to be higher than $14,644.
CONCLUSIONS: When compared with primary SLAP repair and nonoperative treatment, 
primary biceps tenodesis is the most cost-effective treatment strategy for type 
II SLAP tears in middle-aged patients. Primary biceps tenodesis offers increased 
effectiveness when compared with both primary SLAP repair and nonoperative 
treatment and lower costs than primary SLAP repair.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, economic decision analysis.

BACKGROUND: Many public health interventions cannot be evaluated using 
randomised controlled trials so they rely on the assessment of observational 
data. Techniques for evaluating public health interventions using observational 
data include interrupted time series analysis, panel data regression-based 
approaches, regression discontinuity and instrumental variable approaches. The 
inclusion of a counterfactual improves causal inference for approaches based on 
time series analysis, but the selection of a suitable counterfactual or control 
area can be problematic. The synthetic control method builds a counterfactual 
using a weighted combination of potential control units.
METHODS: We explain the synthetic control method, summarise its use in health 
research to date, set out its advantages, assumptions and limitations and 
describe its implementation through a case study of life expectancy following 
German reunification.
RESULTS: Advantages of the synthetic control method are that it offers an 
approach suitable when there is a small number of treated units and control 
units and it does not rely on parallel preimplementation trends like difference 
in difference methods. The credibility of the result relies on achieving a good 
preimplementation fit for the outcome of interest between treated unit and 
synthetic control. If a good preimplementation fit is established over an 
extended period of time, a discrepancy in the outcome variable following the 
intervention can be interpreted as an intervention effect. It is critical that 
the synthetic control is built from a pool of potential controls that are 
similar to the treated unit. There is currently no consensus on what constitutes 
a 'good fit' or how to judge similarity. Traditional statistical inference is 
not appropriate with this approach, although alternatives are available. From 
our review, we noted that the synthetic control method has been underused in 
public health.
CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic control methods are a valuable addition to the range of 
approaches for evaluating public health interventions when randomisation is 
impractical. They deserve to be more widely applied, ideally in combination with 
other methods so that the dependence of findings on particular assumptions can 
be assessed.

OBJECTIVES: To enhance the understanding of the current increase in life 
expectancy and decreasing gender gap in life expectancy.
METHODS: We obtained data on underlying cause of death from the National Board 
of Health and Welfare in Sweden for 1997 and 2014 and used Arriaga's method to 
decompose life expectancy by age group and 24 causes of death.
RESULTS: Decreased mortality from ischemic heart disease had the largest impact 
on the increased life expectancy of both men and women and on the decreased 
gender gap in life expectancy. Increased mortality from Alzheimer's disease 
negatively influenced overall life expectancy, but because of higher female 
mortality, it also served to decrease the gender gap in life expectancy. The 
impact of other causes of death, particularly smoking-related causes, decreased 
in men but increased in women, also reducing the gap in life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a focus on overall changes in life 
expectancies may hide important differences in age- and cause-specific 
mortality. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing modifiable lifestyle 
factors to reduce avoidable mortality.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a 
progressive lung disorder associated with decline of respiratory function, 
affects 10.2% of Spanish adults (40-80 years of age). This study aimed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of two fixed-dose combinations of long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist and long-acting β2-agonist therapies for COPD, with Spanish National 
Health System perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model with five health states based on severity levels defined 
by GOLD 2010 criteria was used to simulate in monthly cycles the evolution along 
a 5-year period of a cohort of moderate-to-severe COPD patients, treated with 
aclidinium-formoterol (ACL/FF) 400/12 µg or tiotropium-olodaterol (TIO/OLO) 
5/5 µg fixed-dose combinations. Clinical data on lung-function improvement were 
obtained from a network meta-analysis and applied to mean baseline 
forced-expiratory-volume in 1 s (FEV1) for the first 24-weeks period. Natural 
history for lung-function decline (41 ml/year) was applied until the end of 
simulation. Risk of exacerbation and pneumonia occurrence were considered. 
Pharmaceutical costs were calculated with dosages according to indication and 
public ex-factory prices. The health state-specific disease management and event 
costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. Total costs (€ 2016) and 
benefits [life-year-gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY)] were 
discounted (3.0% yearly). Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Both therapies provided the same outcomes (4.073 LYG and 2.928 QALY) at 
5-year period. ACL/FF 400/12 µg provided marginally lower costs (€ - 332) 
compared to TIO/OLO 5/5 µg.
CONCLUSION: ACL/FF 400/12 µg was a cost-saving therapy in patients with 
moderate-to-severe COPD in Spain, and provided equivalent effects compared to 
TIO/OLO 5/5 µg.

AIM: Counselling patients and their relatives about non-curative management 
options in colorectal cancer is difficult because of a paucity of published 
data. This study aims to determine outcomes in patients unsuitable for curative 
surgery and the rates of subsequent surgical intervention.
METHOD: This was an analysis of all colorectal cancers managed without curative 
surgery in a district general hospital from a prospectively maintained cancer 
registry between 2009 and 2016, as decided by a multidisciplinary team. Primary 
outcomes were overall survival and secondary outcomes were subsequent 
intervention rates and impact of tumour stage.
RESULTS: In all, 183 patients out of 976 patients (18.8%) were identified. The 
median age at diagnosis was 81 years [interquartile range (IQR) 71-87 years]. 
Overall median survival from diagnosis was 205 days (IQR 60-532 days). One-year 
mortality was 62.3%. Patients were classified into two groups depending on the 
reason for a non-curable approach: patient-related (PR) or disease-related (DR). 
The difference in survival between PR (median 277 days, IQR 70-593) and DR 
(median 179 days, IQR 51-450) was 98 days (P = 0.023). Twenty-four patients were 
alive at the end of the study period; 19 out of 91 cases in PR (20.8%) and five 
out of 92 cases in DR (5.4%). Overall intervention rates were 11.9%, with higher 
rates in the DR group (P = 0.005). Disease stage was not associated with 
subsequent surgical intervention between the two groups (P = 0.392).
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy for non-curatively managed patients within our unit 
was 6.8 months with one in nine patients requiring subsequent surgical admission 
for palliation. This information may be useful when counselling patients with 
incurable colorectal malignancy.

BACKGROUND: The psychosocial and functional impact of strabismus among the 
elderly is increasingly important as life expectancy increases and factors that 
enhance the quality of life become more significant. The purpose of this study 
was to characterize the demographics, presenting complaints, health status, 
underlying etiology, and outcomes of strabismus surgery in three age cohorts of 
Medicare-aged patients.
METHODS: The medical records of patients at least 65 years of age who underwent 
strabismus surgery between 2004 and 2015 in a university-based strabismus 
practice were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were identified and divided into three age 
cohorts for analysis: young-old (age 65-74), middle-old (age 75-84), and old-old 
(age 85+). At least 75% of patients in all cohorts cited diplopia as their chief 
complaint (P = 0.87). There was no difference in sex distribution, type of 
deviation, underlying etiology, or preoperative American Society of 
Anesthesiologists physical status classification scores between the cohorts 
(P = 0.68, P = 0.53, P = 0.71, P = 0.93, resp.). By the 6- to 8-week 
postoperative visit, 63% of all patients reported complete resolution of their 
presenting chief complaint, 23% reported some improvement, and 11% reported no 
improvement, with no difference between the cohorts (P = 0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Given the functional and psychosocial impact of strabismus in the 
elderly, this study lends support to consideration of surgery as a viable option 
to successfully treat strabismus among the oldest age cohorts.

The development of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with human 
immunodeficiency virus reduces the probability of survival in the patient 
affected compared to those without cardiopulmonary disease. The pathophysiology 
is uncertain. There are several lines of research to associate the different 
proteins of the virus in the endothelial lesion. From a therapeutic point of 
view there are treatment modalities that allow an acceptable life expectancy.

Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder caused 
by mutations in the NPC2 gene, leading to lysosomal accumulation of unesterified 
cholesterol and other lipids. It is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, liver 
dysfunction and severe neurological manifestations, resulting in early death. 
There is no effective therapy for NPC2 disease. Here, we evaluated the 
effectiveness of an adeno-associated virus (AAV), serotype rh.10 gene transfer 
vector expressing the mouse Npc2 gene (AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA, HA tagged to 
facilitate analysis) to treat the disease in an Npc2-/- mouse model. A single 
intracisternal administration of the AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA to 6 week old Npc2-/- 
mice mediated vector DNA, transgene mRNA and protein expression in brain and 
other organs. Compared to untreated Npc2-/- mice, AAV-treated Npc2-/- mice 
demonstrated amelioration of disease pathology in the brain, reduced lysosomal 
storage, reduced Purkinje cell death, decreased gliosis, and improved 
performance in behavioral tasks. Treatment-related reduction in serum disease 
markers was detected early and this effect persisted. Liver and spleen pathology 
were improved with significant reduction of liver cholesterol and sphingomyelin 
levels in treated Npc2-/- mice. Finally, administration of AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA 
significantly extended life-span. Taken together, these data demonstrate the 
benefit of a one-time intracisternal administration of AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA as a 
life-long treatment for NPC2 disease.

BACKGROUND: Cannabis is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of negative affect. 
However, a paucity of research has examined the acute effects of cannabis on 
negative affect in everyday life. The current study provides a naturalistic 
account of perceived changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as a 
function of dose and concentration of Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 
cannabidiol (CBD).
METHOD: Data from the app StrainprintTM (which provides medical cannabis users a 
means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and 
chemotypes of cannabis) were analyzed using multilevel modeling. In total, 
11,953 tracked sessions were analyzed (3,151 for depression, 5,085 for anxiety, 
and 3,717 for stress).
RESULTS: Medical cannabis users perceived a 50% reduction in depression and a 
58% reduction in anxiety and stress following cannabis use. Two puffs were 
sufficient to reduce ratings of depression and anxiety, while 10+ puffs produced 
the greatest perceived reductions in stress. High CBD (>9.5%)/low THC (<5.5%) 
cannabis was associated with the largest changes in depression ratings, while 
high CBD (>11%)/high THC (>26.5%) cannabis produced the largest perceived 
changes in stress. No changes in the perceived efficacy of cannabis were 
detected across time. However, baseline symptoms of depression (but not anxiety 
or stress) appeared to be exacerbated across time/tracked sessions.
LIMITATIONS: The primary limitations are the self-selected nature of the sample 
and the inability to control for expectancy effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis reduces perceived symptoms of negative affect in the 
short-term, but continued use may exacerbate baseline symptoms of depression 
over time.

Life expectancy in Hurler syndrome is significantly improved by enzyme therapy 
with bone marrow transplantation. However, the deterioration of skeletal 
abnormalities persists. Hip dysplasia is a common presentation which may 
progress to significant hip arthritis requiring total hip arthroplasty at later 
stage. We report a long-term outcome of cementless total hip arthroplasty in a 
patient with Hurler syndrome who was successfully treated with bone marrow 
transplant.

What rates of glaucoma progression are clinically significant?

Saunders LJ, Medeiros FA, Weinreb RN, Zangwill LM.

Clinically important rates of glaucoma progression (worsening) are ones that put 
a patient at risk of future functional impairment or reduction of vision-related 
quality of life. Rates of progression can be evaluated through measuring 
structural or functional changes of the optic nerve. Most treated eyes do not 
progress at rates that will lead to future visual impairment, but there are a 
significant proportion (3-17%) of eyes, that are at risk of impairment even 
under clinical care. While very fast rates of progression (e.g. MD progression 
of -1.5 dB/year) are generally problematic, much slower rates also may be 
deleterious for young patients, particularly those diagnosed with late disease. 
As a result, it is important to consider life expectancy, disease severity and 
vision-related quality of life based treatment targets to estimate future 
prognosis when evaluating whether a rate of glaucoma progression can be 
clinically relevant.

Perspectives on Providing And Receiving Preventive Health Care From Primary Care 
Providers and Their Patients With Mental Illnesses.

Stumbo SP(1), Yarborough BJH(1), Yarborough MT(1), Green CA(1).

Author information:

PURPOSE: Individuals with mental illnesses have higher morbidity rates and 
reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Understanding how 
patients and providers perceive the need for prevention, as well as the barriers 
and beliefs that may contribute to insufficient care, are important for 
improving service delivery tailored to this population.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional; mixed methods.
SETTING: An integrated health system and a network of federally qualified health 
centers and safety net clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: Interviews (n = 30) and surveys (n = 249) with primary care 
providers. Interviews (n = 158) and surveys (n = 160) with patients diagnosed 
with schizophrenia, bipolar, anxiety, or major depressive disorders.
MEASURES: Semi-structured interviews and surveys.
ANALYSIS: Thematic analysis for qualitative data; frequencies for quantitative 
data.
RESULTS: More than half (n = 131, 53%) of clinicians believed patients with 
mental illnesses care less about preventive care than the general population, 
yet 88% (n = 139) of patients reported interest in improving health. Most 
providers (n = 216, 88%) lacked confidence that patients with mental illnesses 
would follow preventive recommendations; 82% (n = 129) of patients reported they 
would try to change lifestyles if their doctor recommended. Clinicians explained 
that their perception of patients' chaotic lives and lack of interest in 
preventive care contributed to their fatalistic attitudes on care delivery to 
this population. Clinicians and patients agreed on substantial need for 
additional support for behavior changes. Clinicians reported providing 
informational support by keeping messages simple; patients reported a desire for 
more detailed information on reasons to complete preventive care. Patients also 
detailed the need for assistive and tangible support to manage behavioral health 
changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a few clinical changes could help patients 
complete preventive care recommendations and improve health behaviors: improving 
clinician-patient collaboration on realistic goal setting, increasing visit time 
or utilizing behavioral health consultants that bridge primary and specialty 
mental health care, and increasing educational and tangible patient support 
services.

Cancer risk following alpha-emitter exposure.

Tirmarche M(1).

Author information:
(1)Nuclear Safety Authority, ASN, 15, rue Louis Lejeune, 92541 Montrouge, 
France.

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) mandated a task 
group (Task Group 64) to review recently published epidemiological studies 
related to cancer risk and incorporated alpha emitters, and to evaluate whether 
the results might consolidate or challenge assumptions underlying the current 
radiation protection system. Three major alpha emitters were considered: radon 
and its decay products, plutonium, and uranium. Results came mainly from cohorts 
of workers, while for radon, major studies of the general population contributed 
to a better understanding of the risk of lung cancer at low and chronic 
exposure. Selection criteria for the review were: assessment of individual 
exposure of the target organ, long duration of the health survey, availability 
of attained age at end of follow-up, and adjustment for major co-factors. Task 
Group 64 is composed of members from ICRP Committees 1 and 2 (because 
epidemiological and dosimetric expertise were needed) and external experts. A 
first report (ICRP Publication 115) considered the risk of lung cancer related 
to inhalation of radon and its decay products. As the estimated excess risk per 
unit of exposure was higher by a factor of 2 compared with a previous ICRP 
estimate in 1993, Task Group 64 suggested a reconsideration of the reference 
levels for the workplace and for the general population. A second report, using 
the same standardised methodology (lung cancer baselines, population, life 
expectancy), will include estimation of the cancer risk of nuclear workers 
exposed to plutonium, focusing on the risk of lung cancer. A comparison of these 
risks with those of populations exposed to external gamma radiation alone will 
be made in the near future. For uranium, the results related to the 
organ-specific dose were too sparse to draw reliable conclusions, despite a 
recent publication. More research is needed on this topic.

A novel use of cement as a salvage procedure in patients with complex spinal 
injuries with proximal junctional failure.

Divani K(1), Selvadurai S(1), Molloy S(1).

Author information:
(1)Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital , Stanmore , UK.

Long-construct fixations can be complicated by proximal junctional kyphosis. In 
elderly, high-risk patients with numerous comorbidities, lengthy surgical times 
and increased blood loss associated with revision osteotomies and extension of 
fusions are not often tolerated and pose serious life-threatening risks. We 
present a salvage technique used in a patient with proximal junctional failure 
and demonstrate its role in improving symptoms and functionality in those not 
deemed fit for major surgery. Pre- and postoperative pain scores in accordance 
with the visual analogue scale, walking distances and radiographs were reviewed 
in a patient who underwent the salvage technique to ascertain the subjective and 
objective difference in pain and functionality. The patient showed marked 
improvement in pain scores and walking distances postoperatively. Additionally, 
the degree of proximal junctional kyphosis was lower on postoperative 
radiographs. While holding risks of its own, our described technique can be 
performed in select cases and is a good salvage procedure in high-risk patients. 
It prevents their exposure to the risks that accompany large revision operations 
and fusion models with further potential to fail. We recommend that our 
technique is performed only at specialist centres.

BACKGROUND: As a result of the increasing of life expectancy, the incidence of 
pathologies that can lead to operation for bowel obstruction is also increasing. 
Comorbidities and reduced physiological reserve can decrease elderly patients' 
ability to tolerate operations especially in an emergency context. We 
retrospectively evaluated the treatment and outcomes of a cohort of patients 
aged more than 85 years who underwent emergency surgery for intestinal 
occlusion.
METHODS: Two hundred seventy-eight patients who were admitted to our Institution 
and operated for acute bowel obstruction have been included in our study. We 
divided the study population in 2 groups (group A: patients aged>85 years old; 
group B patients aged ≤85 years). We evaluated the differences between the two 
groups in terms of intestinal occlusion aetiology, surgical procedures, 
morbidity and mortality rates.
RESULTS: Group A consisted of 57 patients, group B of 221; elderly patients 
trend in ASA score classification was significantly towards high risk for 
elderly group; statistical analysis did not show differences in terms of bowel 
obstruction etiology (except colon volvulus, more frequent in advanced age), 
type of procedure, duration of hospital stay, procedure-related complication 
rate. Perioperative mortality was significantly higher in elderly group, due to 
the mayor incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory fatal events directly 
related to pre-existing comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high surgical risk, early diagnosis and treatment of
